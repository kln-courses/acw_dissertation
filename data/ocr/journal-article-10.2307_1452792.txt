<plain_text><page sequence="1">EL, ELOHIM, AND YHWH IN THE BIBLE M. H. SEGAL, Hebrew University, Jerusalem THE so-called Documentary Theory, still widely ac- cepted by scholars as a solution of the problem of the composition of the Pentateuch, asserts that the frequent change of the divine names Elohim and Yhwh in the Book of Genesis is caused by a change of the documents com- posing the book, one document (J) using only the name Yhwh, another document (E) using only the name Elohim, and a third document (P) using also the name Elohim and sometimes the name El Shaddai, but not the name Yhwh. The adherents of the Theory, however, have never troubled seriously to investigate whether this assertion is supported by the use of these divine names outside the Pentateuch. The only monograph bearing upon this question is Elohim ausserhalb des Pentateuch by F. Baumgaertel (Leipzig, 1914), but its treatment of the subject is inadequate. Baumgaertel accepts the truth of the Documentary Theory, and the object of his study is to remove the apparent difficulty of the frequent occurrence of Elohim in the OT after the alleged revelation of the name Yhwh in Ex. 3.14 (E), or 6.2 (P). His thesis is that outside the Penta- teuch and the Elohistic books of Qoheleth, the Dialogues of Job, and books ii, iii of the Psalms, Elohim is either a pure appellative or merely a scribal change for Yhwh, a thesis which will hardly recommend itself to serious students. In these pages an attempt will be made to study inde- pendently of the Documentary Theory the various uses of these divine names' both in themselves alone and in stand- 'Our study of the divine names is based upon MT which is author- 89</page><page sequence="2">90 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW ing compound expressions as well as in proper names of persons. It is hoped that the results of the study may shed some fresh light on the difficult problem of the composition of the Pentateuch. EL AND ELOHIM The story of the book of Genesis moves in a strictly monotheistic world, and its God is called Yhwh from the very beginning of the story of man in Gen. 2.4. Heathen deities are referred to only incidentally in the account of Jacob's return from heathen lands (Gen. 31.30 ff., 53; 35.2, 4; also Ex. 12.12). Only with the Sinaitic revelation does the Pentateuch begin to take notice of pagan gods in the prohibition to Israel of all pagan worship (Ex. 20.3 etc.). But beside the name Yhwh, the proper name of Israel's monotheistic God, we find in the Bible from Genesis on- wards two other names for this God, both of an originally appellative signification and both used as synonymous with the proper name Yhwh, viz. the singular noun El, and the plural form Elohim. These two names Israel inherited with its Hebrew speech from its more ancient polytheistic Hebrew kinsmen, but filled them quite early with a monotheistic content. The linguistic relation of these names to each other is uncertain. El has a regular plural form in Elim, but Elohim may be a secondary plural formation of El with the insertion of h which is found in other plural formations, as 'amahot (maidservants) in Hebrew, in the Ugaritic 'amht (maid- servants), bhtm (houses), 'alht (goddesses), and the Aramaic 'abahat (fathers), shemahat (names). Such an infixed h is itative and generally trustworthy. The ancient versions, notably LXX, occasionally differ from MT in the representation of the divine names, but such differences may usually be ascribed to a free rendering or to changes in the text of the versions by copyists.</page><page sequence="3">EL, ELOHIM, AND YHWH IN THE BIBLE-SEGAL 91 also found in some verbs. The preponderately late 'Eloah (first found in Deut. 32.15, 17), which is used only in poetry, may be a secondary singular from Elohim. At any rate it is important to point out that the two nouns El and Elohim are completely identical both in meaning and usage. As we shall see later, El often takes the place of the more usual Elohim, namely when followed by an attribute and especially in the formation of theophoric personal proper names in which Elohim is never used because of its length. El is used chiefly in the elevated diction of poetry, as in the oracles of Balaam,2 in the Prophets, Psalms and Job. In ordinary prose El is used instead of Elohim when accompanied by a qualifying adjective or participle in the singular where the use of the formally plural noun Elohim is felt to be inconvenient, as "a jealous El," "a merciful and gracious El" (Ex. 20.5, etc.; 34.6, etc.), "a great and terrible El" (Deut. 7.21, etc.), "the El who appeared" (rini,), "the El who answered" (m3yn, Gen. 35.1, 3). In its character as an appellative, El is sometimes used in the sense of "divine," as in the frequent declaration of the uniqueness of God and His supremacy over all divine beings (Ex. 15.11; Deut. 3.24; Micah 7.18; Ps. 89.8, etc.). But it must be noted that in its use of El the Hebrew of the Bible is completely unconscious of the ancient pagan use of El as the proper name of the head of the Phoenician, and no doubt also of the Canaanite, pantheon. El in the Bible is fully synonymous with the proper name Yhwh. And even a name like El Elyon (the most high El) of Melchi- zedek, which may have been originally the name of a Canaanite deity, is appropriated by Abraham and identified with his own monotheistic God Yhwh (Gen. 14.18-20, 22). So also other divine names with El, as El Ro'i, El Shaddai, El 'Olam (Gen. 16.13; 17.1, etc.; 21.33), perhaps also of a 2 Num. 23.8, 19, 22, 23; 24.4, 8, 16, 23.</page><page sequence="4">92 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW non-Israelitish origin, are used as designations of Yhwh in His manifold manifestations. The same is true of the use of the more frequent divine name Elohim which in the polytheistic Hebrew of pre- Israelite ages must have been a true plural both in form and in meaning. In the Bible, as no doubt also in the living speech of Israel, it is regularly used as a complete synonym of Yhwh. But true to its originally appellative connotation it is sometimes used in the sense of "divine," and in con- formity with its plural form it is often used of heathen deities, but always with a qualifying epithet or complement expressing its heathen character, such as "other (DTonn, i. e. foreign or strange) Elohim," "the Elohim of the peoples or gentiles," etc. ELOHIM AND YHWH IN COMPOUND EXPRESSIONS The ancient pre-Israelitish and polytheistic origin of the name Elohim becomes apparent in the exclusive use of Elohim in a series of standing compound expressions, usu- ally in the adjectival sense of "divine," which are found in the Bible, and which must also have been current in popular or learned Israelite speech, perhaps in a wider range of similar expressions. But in all these expressions in the Bible (and no doubt also in living speech) Elohim is fully identified with Yhwh. To this series belong the following expressions: sons of Elohim (i. e. divine beings, Gen. 6.2, 4; Job 1.6; 2.1; 38.7; never in the singular), man of Elohim (endowed with special divine power, never in the plural), a prince of Elohim (Gen. 23.6), the rod of Elohim (Ex. 4.20; 17.9; really the rod of Moses endowed with extraordinary power, Ex. 4.2-4; 17), finger of Elohim (Ex. 8.15 (19); 31.18; Deut. 9.10; cf. Ex. 24.12; 34.1; Deut. 5.19; 10.2), and</page><page sequence="5">EL, ELOHIM, AND YHWH IN THE BIBLE-SEGAL 93 probably also image of Elohim, likeness of Elohim, but in a spiritualized sense (Gen. 1.27; 9.6; 5.1). In the sense of supernatural, extraordinary: wrestlings of Elohim, terror of Elohim (Gen. 30.8; 35.5), thunderings of Elohim (Ex. 9.28, beside "Yhwh" in the same verse), trembling of Elohim (I Sam. 14.15), wisdom of Elohim (I Kings 3.28; cf. II Sam. 14.20). A similar use is also found with El: mountains of El, cedars of El (Ps. 36.7; 80.11). But since Elohim in such expressions was identified with Yhwh, we also find in this sense: a deep sleep of Yhwh (I Sam. 26.12). In the related adjectival sense of awful, monstrous, we have the phrase "like the overthrow of Elohim of Sodom" (Isa. 13.19; Jer. 50.40). Especially striking is Amos 4.11, where Yhwh says: "I overthrew some of you like the overthrow of Elohim of Sodom," which shows that the phrase was an ancient fossilized expression. Finally we have a survival from pre-monotheistic times in the use of Elohim in a nominal sense in the antique oath: "thus do Elohim unto me and more also" which occurs eight times in the books of Samuel and Kings (I Sam. 3.17; 14.44; 25.22; II Sam. 3.9, 35; 19.14; I Kings 2.23; II Kings 6.31). That it was not an exclusively Israelite oath is shown by its use in the mouth of heathens with Elohim as a real plural (I Kings 19.2; 20.10). But since to the Israelite, Elohim in this oath was Yhwh, we also find in it the name Yhwh in the place of the original Elohim, viz. I Sam. 20.13; Ruth 1.17. Conversely we have a series of compound expressions formed exclusively with the name Yhwh. These are of a purely Israelitish origin and closely connected with Israel's monotheistic faith. Such are: oracle (mo) of Yhwh (Gen. 22.16; Num. 14.28, and constantly in the Prophets), the anointed of Yhwh (I Sam. 24.7, etc., but cf. II Sam. 23.1), the day of Yhwh (Amos 5.18, and frequently in the Proph-</page><page sequence="6">94 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW ets), the right hand of Yhwh (Hab. 2.16; Ps. 118.16; cf. Ex. 15.6), commandment(s) of Yhwh (Lev. 4.2 etc.), feast of Yhwh (Ex. 10.9 etc.), sanctuary of Yhwh (Num. 19.20; Josh. 24.26 etc. Sanctuary of Adonai, Lam. 2.20, is probably a scribal change for an original Yhwh, caused by the later pronunciation, as we shall see below), abomination of Yhwh (only in Deuteronomy and Proverbs, Deut. 7.25 etc.; Prov. 3.32 etc.), and many others. But in this class of originally monotheistic expressions we sometimes find Elohim in the place of Yhwh for some special reason. Thus "voice of Yhwh" occurs in the Bible some 50 times, but twice we find "voice of Elohim" in the appellative sense of divine as contrasted with human (Deut. 4.33; 5.23). Again "glory, or honor, of Yhwh" occurs 32 times, but once we have "glory of Elohim," also in an appellative sense, as contrasted with "honor of kings" (Prov. 25.2). "Mouth of Yhwh" occurs about 50 times, but once we have "mouth of Elohim" to obviate the implication that the Pharaoh received a prophecy from Yhwh (II Chron. 35.22; contrast ibid. 36.12). Other such changes occur in the so-called Elohistic psalms which, as we shall see later (p. 105), replaced the sacrosanct name Yhwh by the less sacred name Elohim. Thus "name of Elohim," "altar of Elohim," "face of Elohim" (Ps. 69.31; 43.4; 42.3), "at the presence of Elohim" (68.3, 9, a quotation from Judg. 5.5, where Yhwh is used). INTERCHANGE OF YHWH AND ELOHIM In contrast with these expressions with their more or less fixed use of Yhwh and Elohim we have a series of standing expressions with these divine names usually in a purely nominal sense, in which the names interchange freely as synonyms. The interchange is confined almost</page><page sequence="7">EL, ELOHIM, AND YHWH IN THE BIBLE-SEGAL 95 entirely to the early books of the Bible and to the late post- exilic books, but is not found in the literature of the divided monarchy. The importance of this fact will become clear in the course of our enquiry. We shall enumerate here the most frequent of these interchanges. "Ark of Yhwh" occurs 30 times, but "ark of Elohim" occurs 36 times (not in the Hexateuch), often side by side and even in the same verse; cf. I Sam. 3.3; 4.6, 11 ff.; 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 10; 6.1 ff.; II Sam. 6.2 ff., 9-11, 12, 13 ff. In the parallel I Chron. 13 we have only "the ark of Elohim" beside five times Yhwh in the chapter, but the interchange appears in 15.1, 2, 3, 15, 24, also ibid. 12, 14; 16.1. "Ark of the covenant of Yhwh" is found 5 times in the Pentateuch, 6 times in Joshua, and 18 times elsewhere; "ark of the covenant of Elohim" is found Judg. 20.27; I Sam. 4.4 (beside "ark of the covenant of Yhwh Zebaot"); II Sam. 15.24; I Chron. 16.6 (Contrast 37; 15.25). "Spirit of Yhwh" occurs 28 times (not in the Hexateuch), "spirit of Elohim" occurs 16 times (four times in the Pentateuch) in the adjec- tival sense of "divine," Gen. 1.2; 41.38; Ex. 31.3; 35.31). Note the changes in this expression with the verb "to be upon": Num. 24.2; Judg. 3.10; 11.29; I Sam. 16.16, 23; 19.9, 20, 23; II Chron. 15.1; 20.14; with the verb "to rush upon" (nx)): Judg. 14.6, 19; 15.14; I Sam. 10.6, 10; 11.6; 16.13; 18.10; with the verb "to clothe": Judg. 6.34; II Chron. 24.20. "Word of Yhwh" occurs hundreds of times, but we also have six times "word of Elohim," Judg. 3.20; I Sam. 9.27 (with Yhwh in the next verse), II Sam. 16.23; I Kings 12.22; I Chron. 17.3 (with Yhwh in the parallel, II Sam. 7.4); 26.32. "Angel of Yhwh" occurs 53 times, of which 15 are in the Pentateuch; "angel of Elohim" occurs ten times (Gen. 21.17; 31.11; Ex. 14.19; Judg. 6.20; 13.6, 9 (but 13.16 ff.:</page><page sequence="8">96 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Yhwh); I Sam. 29.9; II Sam. 14.17 (beside Yhwh), 20,; 19.28. Similar interchanges are found in many other standing expressions, e. g. law of Yhwh (18 times), law of Elohim (Josh. 24.26, beside "sanctuary of Yhwh"); Nehem. 8.8; 10.29, 30, beside Yhwh; note also ibid. 9.3); house of Yhwh (about 150 times), house of Elohim (about 60 times, Gen. 28.17, 22; Judg. 18.31, and the rest in the post-exilic books Ezra-Nehemiah, Chronicles (often side by side with Yhwh and even in the same verse, as I Chron. 23.28 etc.), in the Elohistic Psalms (42.5; 52.10; 55.15), and in Qohelet (4.17); hand of Yhwh (31 times), hand of Elohim (I Sam. 5.11 (beside "hand of Yhwh", 9; II Chron. 30.12); inheritance of Yhwh (I Sam. 26.19; II Sam. 20.19; 21.3; Ps. 127.3), inheritance of Elohim (II Sam. 14.16); people of Yhwh (nine times), people of Elohim (Judg. 20.2; II Sam. 14.13); fear of Yhwh (22 times), fear of Elohim (Gen. 20.11; II Sam. 23.3; Nehem. 5.9, 15), and similarly: to fear Yhwh, to fear Elohim; fearing Yhwh, fearing Elohim. Finally note the following striking interchanges: "ask (an oracle) of Yhwh" occurs 12 times in Judges and Samuel, but "ask of Elohim" is found in those books five times and twice in Chronicles. Compare especially Judg. 18.5: "ask now of Elohim" with the answer in the next verse: "before Yhwh is your way"; 20.18: "they asked of Elohim ... and Yhwh said" etc., and ibid. 23, 27; I Sam. 14.37: "and Saul asked of Elohim," with Yhwh in vv. 35, 39; I Sam. 22.10: Doeg says: "and he asked for him of Yhwh," but when this is repeated by Saul and the priest they both say: ask of Elohim (vv. 13, 15). In I Chron. 14.10, 14: "David asked of Elohim", but the parallel in II Sam. 5.19, 23 has "of Yhwh." Similarly "inquire (wni) of Yhwh" occurs 28 times, but "inquire of Elohim" also occurs 8 times, Ex. 18.15; I Sam. 9.9; Ps. 14.2 (a "Yahwistic" psalm); 53.3;</page><page sequence="9">EL, ELOHIM, AND YHWH IN THE BIBLE-SEGAL 97 69.33; I Chron. 21.30 (with "angel of Yhwh" in the same verse); II Chron. 19.3 (with twice Yhwh in the previous verse); 26.5 (with "enquire of Yhwh" in the same verse); 30.19 ("to inquire of Elohim Yhwh the Elohim of his fathers"). These synonymous changes cannot conceivably be at- tributed to a change of source or document as the Docu- mentary Theory would have it. In the late post-exilic literature the substitution of Elohim for the usual Yhwh may have been caused, as we shall see later (p. 105), by a desire to avoid the too frequent use of the most sacred name Yhwh. But in the literature of the early period when no scruples existed about the use of the name Yhwh, and when Elohim was still current in living speech, these changes must be ascribed to the fondness of Hebrew writers for a variety of expression by the use of synonyms, as exemplified especially in the parallelistic construction of Hebrew poetry. YHWH AND ELOHIM OUTSIDE THE HEXATEUCH The conclusions we have drawn from the interchange of the two divine names in compound expressions will find strong confirmation in the following inquiry into the general use of these names in the Bible. We shall begin our inquiry with the narrative prose of the historical books. In the book of Judges Elohim occurs as synonym of Yhwh 33 times (10 in compound expressions) as against over 100 times of Yhwh. Notable are the following inter- changes: in 7.14 the Midianite says "Elohim hath given," while Gideon says in the next verse "Yhwh hath given," but in 8.3 Gideon also says "Elohim hath given," and so say the Danites in 18.10. The answer to "Manoah en- treated Yhwh" is "Elohim hearkened to the voice of</page><page sequence="10">98 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Manoah" (13.8, 9). So: "he called on Yhwh" with the answer "Elohim clave" etc. (15.18, 19). Note also the interchange of the names in 21.2, 3. In the account of the sign of the fleece (6.36-40) we have Elohim three times and Yhwh not once. The passage is undoubtedly the direct continuation of the preceding vv. 33-35 which have Yhwh (34), and is not an extract from a new Elohistic source, as held by the critics.3 This is shown by the words "if thou wilt save Israel by mine hand as thou hast said" (v. 37) which refer back to vv. 14-15 which have Yhwh. Also "and he rose early" (7.1), with Yhwh in the following verses, goes back to "in that night" (6.40). Moreover "let not thine anger be hot against me and I will speak but this once" (6.39) is undoubtedly a reminiscence from Gen. 18.32, 30, which the Documentary Theory assigns to J.3a This short passage with the use of Elohim only is paralleled by Judg. 9, which also uses only Elohim, and by many such Elohistic passages in the book of Genesis with which we shall deal below (p. 113). Elohim is used in these passages for the sake of literary variety, as it must have been frequently used in the current Israelitish speech of the day as a synonym of the more usual Yhwh. The proportionate use of the two names in the books of Samuel is similar to their use in Judges. In the ancient story of the anointment of Saul (I Sam. 9-10, 16) Yhwh occurs three times and once in a compound expression (9.15, 17; 10.1, 6), against three times Elohim (10.3, 7, 9) and eight times in compound expressions (9.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 27; 10.5, 10), but in the younger story of Saul's election by lot (10.17-27) Yhwh occurs seven times and Elohim only once (10.26). 3 Cf. among others, K. Budde, Richter und Samuel (1890), p. 110 f.; G. F. Moore, Judges (ICC), p. 198; also C. F. Burney, Judges, p. 178. 3a Contrary to the current view that it is of post-exilic origin; cf. my Mebo' Hamiqra', iii, p. 690 f.</page><page sequence="11">EL, ELOHIM, AND YHWH IN THE BIBLE-SEGAL 99 In the ancient story of the battle of Michmash (14) we have 13 times Yhwh (7 in compound expressions) and only seven times Elohim (four in compound expressions). No- table interchanges of the names in these books are: Elohim and Yhwh in one verse (I Sam. 14.45); "Elohim hath delivered" (-1 , "nD), "Yhwh hath delivered" (23.7; 26.8; 24.18, a younger account); "Elohim delivered" (lm), "Yhwh delivered" (24.4, 10; 26.23; 14.10, 12); "Elohim is departed," "Yhwh is departed" (28.15, 16); "David besought Elohim" (II Sam. 12.16, beside 13 times Yhwh in the chapter), "David besought the face of Yhwh" (21.1; so always Yhwh with this verb); "he worshipped (innr) Elohim" (15.32, beside Yhwh in the previous verse), else- where always Yhwh with this verb; "Elohim was intreated" (21.14, beside seven times Yhwh in that story), "Yhwh was intreated" (24.25; so also Gen. 25.21, etc.). Another noteworthy detail in this book is that the wise woman of Tekoa says to David "Yhwh thy Elohim," but for herself she speaks only of Elohim (II Sam. 14.11, 17,13, 14, 16, 17), apparently because the name Elohim was more usual to her and to others in the popular speech of the day. In the books of Kings the use of Elohim as synonymous with Yhwh continues, though to a less extent, until the end of Solomon's reign. Thus I Kings 1.47 (Qere); 3.5 (with Yhwh in same verse), 11; 5.9 (contrast v. 26); 8.25 (next verse: Yhwh); 10.24; 11.23 (contrast v. 14). In the rest of the books of Kings which deal with the story of the divided monarchy, the use of Elohim as synonymous with Yhwh practically disappears. It is found only in the standing expressions: man of Elohim, word of Elohim (I Kings 12.22), mount of Elohim (19.8, a reminiscence from Ex. 3.1), the euphemistic phrase "curse (rIn) Elohim" (I Kings 21.10, 13), and in the appellative sense (I Kings 18.39; II Kings 1.3, 12, etc.). Elohim is not found in the book of</page><page sequence="12">100 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Ruth, the composition of which belongs to the period of the divided monarchy prior to the war with Mesha, king of Moab.4 It is not found in the narrative portions of the book of Jeremiah, nor in the Lachish letters of the same period. It may be surmised that just in the time when in consequence of Solomon's concessions to his foreign wives in Jerusalem and of Jeroboam's innovations in Israel (I Kings 11.5 ff.; 12.28 ff.) the polytheism of Canaanite idol- atry became a potent influence in both kingdoms, the faithful worshippers of Yhwh adopted the exclusive use of the name Yhwh and eschewed the use of the plural form Elohim as a designation of their monotheistic God. But the firm and long-standing establishment of strict monotheism in the post-exilic period produced in the use of the divine name a tendency in the opposite direction. A heightened sense of the sanctity of the deity and of the sacredness of its own proper name led to the avoidance of a too frequent employment of the name Yhwh which gradu- ally became ineffable, and to its replacement by a synon- ymous substitute. The first stage in this tendency was the revival of the use of Elohim which appears clearly in the books of Chronicles. Against about 500 times Yhwh (about 80 in compound expressions) Chronicles has about 140 times Elohim (60 in compound expressions), and frequently writes Elohim in the place of Yhwh in its source of II Samuel and Kings. A similar use of these names is found in the narrative book of Jonah which is also a post-exilic production, as is proved especially by its late idiom. Jonah has 26 times Yhwh and 11 times Elohim. 4 This fact and the avoidance of Elohim in the dialogues of Job are sufficient to dispose of the theory of U. Cassuto (La Questione della Genesi (1934), pp. 19 ff.; Encyc. Biblica (Hebrew, 1950), I, col. 313-315), that the name Elohim is peculiar to biblical Wisdom Literature which it inherited from the older Wisdom of the ancient east.</page><page sequence="13">EL, ELOHIM, AND YHWH IN THE BIBLE-SEGAL 101 This tendency becomes more pronounced in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, especially in the personal memoirs embodied in the books, the diction of which must have resembled closely the spoken Hebrew of their writers. In Ezra's memoirs (Ezra 7.27-10.17) we have Yhwh alone only in the standing expressions "house of Yhwh," "holy unto Yhwh" (8.28; cf. Ex. 28.36 etc.), "burnt offering unto Yhwh" (8.35; cf. Num. 8.12 etc.). Elsewhere Ezra uses Yhwh in combination with Elohim in an inflected form (7.27 etc.) or Elohim alone in an inflected form (8.18 etc.). The case is even stronger in Nehemiah's memoirs (Nehem. 1-6; 12.27-13.31). Nehemiah has Yhwh only twice and both in a liturgical context (1.5; 5.13; cf. Gen. 24.7; Ezra 1.2; Ps. 148.1 etc.). Elsewhere Nehemiah uses Elohim in the absolute or in an inflected form. Of the other post- exilic books, Qohelet uses only Elohim. Daniel has Elohim (1.9, 17), Adonai (Lord, 1.2, a transcription of Yhwh in its later pronunciation). Adonai also occurs alone or combined with other divine names in the liturgical chapter 9. That chapter has also seven times Yhwh (alone or combined with the inflected form of Elohim), which was no doubt pronounced by the author as Adonai, just as in Ben Sira and in the liturgy of the Synagogue. We may now review briefly the occurrence of Elohim in the prophetical and poetical portions of the Bible. Since, as we have seen, the use of Elohim as a synonym with Yhwh in narrative prose is derived from the spoken Hebrew of the day and has its ultimate origin in the ancient Hebrew of pre-monotheistic ages, it follows that the prophets and religious poets, with their devotion to pure monotheism and their diction elevated far above colloquial speech, would avoid the use of Elohim as a synonym with Yhwh. And in fact in the Prophets Elohim is frequent only in its inflected form (with or without the accompanying Yhwh):</page><page sequence="14">102 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the Elohim of, thy Elohim, your Elohim. It is also found in a few standing expressions, and of course also in an appellative sense. In the book of Isaiah Elohim is found three times in standing expressions: the recompense of Elohim (35.4), smitten of Elohim (53.4), drawing near to Elohim (58.2; so Ps. 73.28), all in rather late prophecies. In Jeremiah we have "the living Elohim," as contrasted with the dead idols, and in an accumulation of divine epithets (10.10, and again so, 23.36). In Ezekiel, we have visions of Elohim (1.1; 8.3; 40.2), spirit of Elohim (11.24), in an adjectival sense of divine. So also in the description of the deified ruler of Tyre: seat of Elohim, heart of Elohim, mount of Elohim, garden of Elohim (28.2, 6, 16, 13; also 31.8, 9; contrast Isa. 51.3; Gen. 13.10). In Hosea we have the standing expression "knowledge of Elohim" (4.1; 6.6, so Prov. 2.5; cf. ibid. 30.3), undoubtedly synonymous with Yhwh, cf. Hos. 6.2; 2.22; 5.4; Isa. 11.9, and elsewhere. But Hos. 12.4 (3): "he had power with Elohim" is appellative, as is shown by the next verse: "he had power with an angel." In Micah 3.7: "an answer of Elohim" is used specially of the false prophets as contrasted with the true prophet who is "full of the spirit of Yhwh" (v. 8). In Zech. 8.23, Elohim in the mouth of the heathen may be an appellative. So certainly in Mal. 2.15: seed of Elohim, i. e. godly seed, cf. "holy seed" (Isa. 6.13; Ezra 9.2). On the other hand, Mal. 3.8, 14, 15, 18, uses Elohim as a synonym of Yhwh. Perhaps we may see in this use of Elohim in the conversa- tional diction of this post-exilic prophet the signs of the post-exilic revival of the use of Elohim for Yhwh which we found in post-exilic prose narrative. Passing now to the books of Hokmah, we may note that in the narrative framework of the book of Job (1-2; 42, and the author's headings: 38.1; 40.1, 3, 6; 42.1), the author</page><page sequence="15">EL, ELOHIM, AND YHWH IN THE BIBLE-SEGAL 103 himself uses only Yhwh, except in the standing expressions with Elohim in an appellative sense "sons of Elohim" (1.6; 2.1), "fearing Elohim," i. e. religious (1.1, even in the mouth of Yhwh: 1.8; 2.3), and in the euphemistic phrase "Charged Elohim with foolishness" (1.22; cf. "bless Elo- him," 1.5; 2.9 etc.). Job says Elohim (2.10), but uses the name Yhwh in his prayer of resignation (1.21) which may have been framed by the author on the model of a similar prayer with the name Yhwh current in his day. In the dialogues Yhwh occurs only once in a quotation from Isa. 41.20 (12.9, but some MSS read: 'Eloah). But then the name Elohim is also exceedingly rare in the dialogues, occurring only three times (5.8; 28.23; 34.9), against 53 times El, 43 times 'Eloah, and 31 times Shaddai. The reason for this avoidance in the dialogues of the Israelitish Yhwh and Elohim is to be found in the author's endeavor to preserve the archaistic atmosphere of the discussion and the representation of the participants as monotheistic sages of an ancient pre-Israelite age. In the other great Hokmah book, Proverbs, Yhwh is used almost exclusively,s Elohim occurring only three times in the standing expressions "knowledge of Elohim" (2.5), "glory of Elohim" (25.2) which we have discussed above (p. 102), and "eyes of Elohim" (3.4; so I Chron. 21.7), against hundreds of times "eyes of Yhwh" in the Bible. Perhaps the coupling in this phrase of the divine name with "and man" is responsible for the use of the less sacred name Elohim. We have already mentioned that in the late third book of Hokmah, Qohelet, only Elohim is used. Perhaps the exclusive use of Yhwh in Proverbs may be cited as an argument against the current post-exilic dating of the book. 5 D. Diringer, L'Iscrizioni antiche-Ebraiche Palestinesi, passim; S. Moscati, L'Epigrafia Ebraica antica, passim.</page><page sequence="16">104 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW More complicated is the use of these two names in the Psalms. In the hymns scattered in the historical books (Judg. 5; I Sam. 2.1-10; II Sam. 22; Jonah 2.3-10; I Chron. 16.8-36) only Yhwh is used. So also in the liturgical dirges collected in the book of Lamentations which were probably recited on the annual fast in commemoration of the destruction of Jerusalem (cf. Zech. 7.3, 5) and were composed in an alphabetical acrostic to assist the memory. An exception to this rule is found in David's Last Words (II Sam. 23.1-7). This psalm has once Elohim, but only beside several other divine names and epithets: Elohim of Jacob, Yhwh, Elohim of Israel, Rock of Israel, Elohim, El, resembling in this respect some hymns in the book of Psalms which show an accumulation of divine names, viz. Ps. 7 (4 times Yhwh, 3 times Elohim, twice Yhwh my Elohim, once Yhwh Elyon, and once El), Ps. 9-10 (to- gether one alphabetical psalm, as in LXX; 14 times Yhwh, twice Elohim, twice El, once Elyon), 68 (13 times Elohim, 7 times Adonai, five times El, twice Yhwh, once Yah), 78 (seven times Elohim, five times El, twice Yhwh, once Elyon, once El Elyon, once Elohim Elyon, once Adonai). Apart from these psalms with a special use of the divine names, the psalms in book I use only Yhwh, except Elohim in 5.11; 36.2, 8; 25.22, which may be an addition to the alphabetical psalm. A similar addition in 34.23, has Yhwh. Book IV has no Elohim. Book V has Elohimin the com- posite psalm 144.9, and as an appellative in 138.1. Ps. 108 has six times Elohim, but it is a duplicate of the Elohistic psalms 57.8-12; 60.6-14. But contrary to this almost completely Yahwistic charac- ter of books, I, IV-V, books II-III show a preponderant use of Elohim. In book II Yhwh occurs 30 times and Elohim 164 times. In book III, Pss. 73-83 have Yhwh 13 times and Elohim 36 times, and Pss. 84-89 have Yhwh</page><page sequence="17">EL, ELOHIM, AND YHWH IN THE BIBLE-SEGAL 105 31 times and Elohim only 7 times. But it is quite clear (as has been recognized by modern scholars) that the preponderance of Elohim in those psalms cannot be orig- inal. The psalmists could not have used such expressions as "Elohim my Elohim" (43.4), "Elohim thy Elohim" (45.8), "Elohim the Elohim of Israel" (68.9), instead of the usual Yhwh my Elohim, etc. They could not have quoted Ex. 20.2 in the form of "Elohim thy Elohim am I" (50.7), or the phrases from Num. 10.35; Judg. 5.4-5, with Elohim instead of with the original Yhwh (68.1, 8-9). That this profuse use of Elohim is not due to the authors of the psalms but to their copyists is also evident from a compari- son of the duplicate psalms 14.2, 4, 7, with 53.3, 5, 7; 40.14, 17, 18 (Adonai=Yhwh) with 70.2, 5, 7. The reason which moved the copyist to change in these psalms the name Yhwh into Elohim must have been the same which moved Ezra and Nehemiah to avoid the use of Yhwh in their memoirs and which moved the Chronicler to substitute Elohim for Yhwh in his sources the books of II Samuel and Kings, viz. the pious awe for the dread sanctity of the proper name of God; cf. Deut. 28.58 and similar passages which were interpreted literally. We may reasonably conjecture that in reading their scriptures this copyist of the psalms and his pious circle, as well as the Chronicler and his contemporaries, really pronounced the name Yhwh as Elohim, and therefore when the copyist prepared a copy of the psalms, perhaps for the practical use of levitical singers in the Temple, he wrote the name Yhwh as it had become customary to pronounce it, though he did not effect the change completely, leaving in many places the original form Yhwh. And by chance it was the copy of this copyist which found its way in our great collection of the Psalms. The pronunciation of Yhwh as Elohim has been pre-</page><page sequence="18">106 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW served whenever Yhwh is preceded by Adonai (Lord, Gen. 15.2, etc.). But in time Elohim also was held to be too sacred for a too frequent use, and then was introduced the pronunciation of Yhwh as Adonai which prevails to this day, and which is represented in the Masoretic text as a Qere by the vowel signs of Adonai attached to Yhwh. Moreover it seems that in some passages Adonai replaced Yhwh in the text just as Elohim replaced it in books II, III of the Psalms. Thus in Ps. 40.18, Adonai stands for Yhwh and is replaced by Elohim in the Elohistic version, 70.6. Compare also Ps. 57.10 with 108.4; 86.15 with Ex. 34.6; Job 28.28 with Prov. 1.7; Ps. 111.10. So Dan. 9.3, 4, 15 and elsewhere. We may also conjecture that Adonai replaced an original Yhwh in some anthropomorphic ex- pressions, as Amos 9.1; Isa. 6.1; 3.17; 4.4; 7.20; Ps. 44.24; 73.20; 78.65; 79.12, and some similar cases. THE EVIDENCE OF THEOPHORIC PERSONAL NAMES We may now summarize the results of our enquiry in the relative use of Yhwh and Elohim in the books outside the Hexateuch. Prophecy and religious poetry (with the excep- tion of the dialogues in Job) use regularly the name Yhwh, and Elohim only in an inflected form or in an appellative sense and in a few standing expressions. The practice of narrative prose in the use of the two names may be classified in three stages: in the early historical literature (Judges- I Kings 11) Elohim is found more or less frequently as a synonym of the usual Yhwh; in the period of the divided monarchy (I Kings 13 - II Kings, Ruth and the narrative portions of Jeremiah) the use of Elohim as synonymous with Yhwh disappears, and finally in post-exilic prose (Chron- icles, Ezra-Nehemiah, Jonah and also Qohelet) the use of Elohim is revived as a substitute for Yhwh.</page><page sequence="19">EL, ELOHIM, AND YHWH IN THE BIBLE-SEGAL 107 These results receive striking corroboration in the history of the formation of theophoric proper names of persons composed with the abbreviated elements of Yhwh and El = Elohim respectively. We have already noted above (p. 104) that in historical times as represented by Bible literature, El is found only in poetry as somewhat of an archaism. In prose El replaces Elohim when the employment of Elohim would be cumbrous, as with an adjective or a participle in the singular. Since Elohim is too long a word to be used in the formation of personal names, the regular employment of El for this purpose, whether as the first or the second ele- ment of the compound name, must be considered either as an abbreviation of the longer Elohim (just as Yeho (Yo), Yahu (Yah) in proper names are an abbreviation of Yhwh), or as a replacement of Elohim, as it replaces Elohim in the cases cited above. At any rate we are justified in assuming that in historical times when Elohim was current in popular speech as synonymous with Yhwh, El in proper personal names is equivalent to, and actually represents, the longer and more usual name Elohim. Now in the books of Judges-I Kings 11 we find 26 persons bearing names composed with the Yhwh element (from Joash=Jehoash, Judg. 6.11, to Ahijah, I Kings 11.29), and 20 persons bearing names with the El = Elohim element (from Othniel, Judg. 3.9, to Elihoreph, I Kings 4.3). In the extra list of David's (transjordanic) heroes in I Chron. 11.41b-47, four names are with the Yhwh element and six with the El element. In the list of David's support- ers, I Chron. 12 we find 18 names with Yhwh and 11 names with El. But in I Kings 13-II Kings 25 there are 53 persons with Yhwh names, and only seven persons with El names, and one name combining both elements (Elijah). In the book of Jeremiah 42 persons have Yhwh names and seven El names, in Isaiah, three additional names with</page><page sequence="20">108 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Yhwh (8.2) and only one symbolic name with El (Emanuel, 7.14), in Ezekiel four with Yhwh (8.11; 11.1) and one with El (the name of the prophet). The same decisive preponder- ance of Yhwh names is found in extra-canonical sources belonging to the period of the divided monarchy, in the Samaria ostraca, the jar handles and seals,6 the Lachish letters7 (17 names with Yhwh, one with El), and the Elephantine papyri8 of the Jewish colony descended most probably from Judean migrations into Egypt in the age of Jeremiah (over 100 names with Yhwh, and not one with El). The same proportion between these two names continues in the list of the first returned exiles in Ezra 2 // Nehem. 7 (11 Yhwh names, and only one El name), but there is a distinct revival of El names in the age of Ezra. In the list of Ezra 8 we find 12 names with El, against 28 names with Yhwh, and in Ezra 10 we have 19 names with El against 40 names with Yhwh. These figures demonstrate that up to the end of Solomon's reign the divine name El = Elohim was still fully active in the language of the people for the formation of names, that it became practically dormant in the period of the divided monarchy, and that it was revived for this purpose in the post-exilic period, thus confirming the conclusions we have drawn from the relative occur- rence of the names Yhwh and Elohim in the narrative literature of the OT outside the Hexateuch. YHWH AND ELOHIM IN THE BOOK OF JOSHUA We may now turn our attention to the use of these divine names in the Hexateuch. We shall begin this part of our study with the book of Joshua. But we wish to observe at 6 H. Torczyner, The Lachish Letters, 1938. 7 A. Cowley, Aramaic Papyri (1923), Index. 8 M. Noth, Das Buch Josua (1938); A.

Weiser, Einleitung in das AT, pp. 111 ff.</page><page sequence="21">EL, ELOHIM, AND YHWH IN THE BIBLE-SEGAL 109 the outset that the attachment by the Documentary Theory of the book of Joshua to the Pentateuch to form a Hexa- teuch is an error shown as such by ancient trustworthy tradition. If Joshua had ever formed part of the Penta- teuchal corpus, the Torah, the Jews would never have detached it from the holy Torah and reduced it to a lower degree of sanctity. And the Samaritans, who claimed to have been the descendants of the House of Joseph, would never have rejected together with all the other non- Pentateuchal books of the Bible a book which glorified the prophet and hero of Ephraim and which proclaimed the sanctity of their holy city Shechem and its holy mount (Josh. 8.30 ff.; 24.1, 25-6). Moreover all recent exponents of the Documentary Theory admit that the documentary analysis of the Pentateuch does not work out at all in the book of Joshua, and that the process of composition of this book differed radically from that of the Pentateuch, which proves that Joshua had never formed an integral part of the Pentateuch. The main narrative portions of the book (1-12; 24) were undoubtedly composed in the northern kingdom, as is shown by the interest of the narratives (as distinguished from the topographical chapters, 14.6-15, 63) in localities belonging to the northern kingdom. The unhistorical con- ception in these narratives that Joshua had effected a complete conquest of the land with the total destruction of the former inhabitants could only have arisen in a time when the slow process of conquest (still reflected in Judg. 1 and elsewhere) had long been forgotten, and when the numerous Canaanite survivors had long been completely absorbed by, and fully identified with, their Israelite con- querors. From the buoyant and optimistic tone of the narratives (see especially 21.41-43) it may be concluded that they were written in a time of comparative prosperity</page><page sequence="22">110 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW and political stability, probably in the reign of the Omri dynasty. At any rate the main narrative portions of the book must be assigned to the period of the divided monarchy. In conformity with the other literature of that period, discussed above, these narratives use the name Yhwh almost exclusively, but Elohim as synonym of Yhwh is found in the standing expression "before Elohim" (24.1; so Judg. 21.1; also Gen. 6.11; Ex. 18.12; I Chron. 13.8, for Yhwh in II Sam. 6.5, against hundreds of times "before Yhwh" elsewhere), "in the book of the law of Elohim," (24.26; so Nehem. 8.8, 18; also 10.29, 30; cf. ibid. 9.3, against 18 times elsewhere "the law of Yhwh," cf. above p. 96). Perhaps we may conjecture that Elohim in this phrase was intended to differentiate Joshua's lawbook from the lawbook of Moses (Josh. 8.31, 32; 23.6; Nehem. 8.1, etc.). Or perhaps the original of this chapter is older than the other narratives, and belongs to the period of Judges-I Kings 11, when (as we have seen above) Elohim was still occasionally used for Yhwh. The chapter shows some other very old features, as the use of a plural ad- jective with Elohim (v. 19; cf. Gen. 20.13; 35.7), the setting up of a great stone under the oak in the sanctu- ary of Shechem (v. 26), and some details in the historical review (vv. 2-12) which do not quite tally with accounts elsewhere. In a narrative which seems to be late we have the unusual phrase "the children of Israel blessed Elohim" (22.33; so in the Elohistic psalm 68.27, 36, also 66.8, 20). That narrative also has Elohim twice in an accumulation of divine names in a solemn asseveration (v. 22; so Ps. 50.1. Note the order of the names "El Elohim Yhwh," in ac- cordance with their ascending order of sanctity or with their probable revelation in Israel). However this sporadic</page><page sequence="23">EL, ELOHIM, AND YHWH IN THE BIBLE-SEGAL 111 occurrence of Elohim in the book (which springs from different causes) is not sufficient to affect the Yahwistic character of the book as a whole. YHWH AND ELOHIM IN THE PENTATEUCH Coming finally to the Pentateuch we may start our review of the use in it of these divine names with the book of Deuteronomy. This book consists mainly of a series of edifying and legislative discourses delivered at the bidding of God (Deut. 1.3; 6.1) by Moses before his death. In these discourses, couched in elevated and rhetorical diction, the prophet Moses uses only the name Yhwh which he (like the prophets after him) always employed also elsewhere when addressing Israel in the name of their God. Elohim is however constantly used in the book in an inflected form as an attribute of Yhwh: Yhwh thy, your, our Elohim. In an absolute form Elohim is found in the standing phrases in a somewhat appellative sense: voice of Elohim (4.33; 5.23; elsewhere always "voice of Yhwh," 44 times of which 12 are found in Deuteronomy), and "not fearing Elohim" (i. e. irreligious, impious, of Amalek, 25.18; cf. above, p. 94). In the attenuated sense of divine, Elohim occurs also in two other phrases (4.34; 5.21) and once as a real synonym of Yhwh: "Elohim created man" (4.32), but this is a direct quotation from Gen. 5.1; 1.27. The book of Leviticus with its special divine legislation for Israel, as well as the legislative portions in Exodus (excepting chapters 21-22, which may have been influenced by an older pre-Israelite legislation) and in Numbers naturally use Yhwh alone. So also the sections in Exodus and Numbers which deal with the holy tabernacle and its service and servants, and which mark the special relation of Israel to God, have only Yhwh the proper name of</page><page sequence="24">112 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Israel's God. Elohim as an interchangeable synonym of Yhwh is found in the Pentateuch only in the narratives of Genesis, the early chapters of Exodus and Num. 22-23. The problem of this use of Elohim in these Pentateuchal narratives, which occupies a basic position in the Docu- mentary Theory, may be formulated under two heads; (i) the interchange of Yhwh and Elohim in the same context (e. g. Gen. 7-8; 28.10-22; Ex. 2.23-3; 13.17-22; 18-19; Num. 22-23); (ii) the exclusive use of Elohim instead of the usual Yhwh in certain long passages (e. g. Gen. 1; 2; 3; 9.1-17; 17; 20, etc.). Now the results of our study in the use of these names in certain standing expressions (p. 94) and in the narrative prose of the historical books (p. 101) have proved beyond a shadow of doubt that, contrary to the assertion of the Documentary Theory, the change of the names is not caused by a change of literary source or document. Further our results have shown that outside the Pentateuch the use of Elohim as a synonym of Yhwh may be considered as a sort of colloquialism derived from the spoken Hebrew of the day which had inherited it from a pre-monotheistic age, and which had its parallel in theophoric personal names formed with the element El = Elohim. The authors especially of the narratives in the early books Judges-I Kings 11 intro- duced the popular synonym Elohim by the side of Yhwh for the sake of literary variety. This explanation of the interchange of the names in the historical books is fully adequate to explain also the interchange of the names in the same context in the Pentateuch. The greater abundance of Elohim in the Pentateuchal narratives as compared with the historical books must be explained by the greater antiquity of the Pentateuchal narratives when the name Elohim was more frequent in the spoken language than in the post-Mosaic ages. This is proved by a comparison of</page><page sequence="25">EL, ELOHIM, AND YHWH IN THE BIBLE-SEGAL 113 the use of the Yhwh element with the use of the El = Elohim element in personal names recorded in the Pentateuch. The number of Israelite personal names with El in the Penta- teuch (from Jemuel, Gen. 46.10 onwards) is 35, as compared with only two names with Yhwh (Jochebed and Joshua). These Israelite El names in the Pentateuch are quite indis- tinguishable from the 13 non-Israelite El names mentioned in Genesis (Gen. 4.18 etc.). We may therefore conclude that though the name Yhwh was certainly well known to the Israelites before the exodus and the Sinaitic revelation, the name Elohim as a synonym of Yhwh was more frequent in Israelite speech than Yhwh, and hence its use in the narratives of the Pentateuch by the side of Yhwh. As for the exclusive use of Elohim in certain passages in Genesis, this may be due to a variety of causes. Thus in the story of the creation which opens the Torah (Gen. 1-2.3) the creator is designated by the name Elohim, by which name the deity was generally known in the Hebrew speaking world, but in the immediately following story of the detailed creation of man and of his fall (2.4-3.24) the deity is described as Yhwh Elohim in order to indicate the identity of Elohim, the creator, with Yhwh, the God of Israel, as the prophet expresses it: "Yhwh the creator of the heavens He is the Elohim who formed the earth and made it .... I am Yhwh and there is none else" (Isa.45.18). Again in the section containing the divine commandments to Noah and his sons and the covenant with all flesh (9.1-17), the deity is called Elohim, because the section is addressed to all mankind and not to Israel alone. Likewise the section enjoining circumcision (17) uses the name Elohim (but in v. 1: Yhwh), because the command em- braces also all the other descendants of Abraham besides Israel. In other passages, like Gen. 20 (but v. 18: Yhwh); 21 (but vv. 1, 33: Yhwh), Elohim may have been preserved</page><page sequence="26">114 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW from an older form of the story as transmitted by oral tradition. Finally the use of Elohim alone even in a complete passage may be due to a fondness for a stylistic variety of language, as we have found in Judg. 6.36-40; 9, discussed above (p. 98). INTERCHANGE OF PROPER AND COMMON NOUNS The designation of the deity by the combination of the proper name Yhwh in apposition with what is grammat- ically an appellative common noun Elohim, Yhwh Elohim, which we find in Gen. 2-3 is quite rare with Elohim in the absolute form (Ex. 9.30; II Sam. 7.22, 25; Jer. 10.10, etc.). It is however (as we noted above) very frequent with Elohim in an inflected form: Yhwh my, thy, our, your Elohim. The interchange of Yhwh and Elohim in narrative prose finds its parallel in the frequent interchange of Yhwh, Yhwh Elohim (and Elohim alone) in the inflected form, especially in the rhetorical style. Thus in the deca- logue (Ex. 20.2-12): Yhwh thy Elohim (2, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12), Yhwh (7, 11, 11). So Lev. 18.2, 4, 5, 6, etc.; Num. 15.39, 40, 41; and very often in Deuteronomy (4; 5; 6.20-25) and elsewhere in the OT. This interchange of a proper noun and its appellative common noun is not confined to the divine names. It is a regular feature of biblical narrative prose. Thus in the description of Jethro in Ex. 18 we have: Jethro the father- in-law of Moses (vv. 2, 5, 12), Jethro (9, 10), the father-in- law of Moses (12, 14, 17), his father-in-law (7, 8, 15, 24, 27). I Sam. 21: Achimelech the priest (2, 3), Achimelech (2, 9), the priest (5, 6, 7, 9). Further the constant changes between "David," "the king," "king David" in II Sam. 15-20; 21.1-14; 24; I Kings 1; between "Solomon," "the king," "king Solomon" in I Kings 1.50-53; 2.13-46;</page><page sequence="27">EL, ELOHIM, AND YHWH IN THE BIBLE-SEGAL 115 10.1-13; between "Rehoboam," "the king," "king Reho- boam" in I Kings 12.1-19; between "Ahab king of Israel," "king of Israel," "Ahab," "the king" in I Kings 20; between "Elisha," "the man of Elohim," "Elisha the man of Elohim" in II Kings 4-5. Further instructive examples of such interchanges are to be found in the description of Josiah (II Kings 23.1-24), of Zedekiah (Jer. 38), of Ruth (Ruth 2), of David (I Chron. 28-29), of Hezekiah (II Chron. 29-30), of Ahasuerus and Esther (Esth. 2, etc.; 7-8), of Ezra (Ezra 10; Neh. 8), of Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar (Dan. 3; 8), and others. These varying interchanges in one and the same context of the proper noun with its corresponding appellative common noun, both of which are drawn from living speech, are exactly parallel to the interchanges in the same context of the divine names Yhwh and Elohim. Moreover the exclusive use of Elohim in a longer passage in the narratives of Genesis and Exodus is paralleled by the exclusive use of "the king" for the proper name David (II Sam. 14), Solomon (I Kings 3.16-28), and Nebuchadnezzar (Dan. 2, with the exception of v. 46). And just as those inter- changes of human proper nouns and their respective appel- lative common nouns cannot by any stretch of imagination be ascribed to a change of author or source or document, so also the corresponding interchanges of the divine names in the Pentateuch must not be attributed to such a literary cause. They all have their source in the living speech of the day and in the fondness of the Hebrew writers for the use of a picturesque variety of expression.</page></plain_text>
