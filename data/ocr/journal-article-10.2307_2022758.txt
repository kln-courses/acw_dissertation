<plain_text><page sequence="1">II. THE PRESENT STATUS OF DETERMINISM IN PHYSICS IN a debate which finds theoretical physicists of the first rank in radical disagreement, the philosopher's task is a hazardous one.' He must face the double handicap of his serious technical limita- tiolls and the guarantee of powerful adversaries, whichever con- clusion he may espouse. In short, he is compelled to join a bloody and well-balanced battle with his hands tied behind his back. Thus my comments on the physical evideiace today must be re- garded as unrelated to that discretion which is the better part of valor. They are possibly valorous, but certainly indiscreet. Yet there is a purely philosophical task involved; for one cannot discuss 1 This paper is based in part on work done with support from the Na- tional Science Foundation and the Hill Foundation, and I wish to express my gratitude to them as also to my colleagues at the 1957 sessions of the Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science and the Colston Society Sympo- sium in Bristol for their immensely valuable discussions of this topic.</page><page sequence="2">728 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY determinism in physics as one discusses, e.g., radioactivity in petroleum deposits, since there is no commonly accepted philo- sophical analysis of determinism itself. So I shall begin with an examination of the doctrine itself, proceed to consider the physical evidence, and conclude with a brief attempt to relate my conclu- sions in these sections to the major consequential areas-the analy- sis of responsibility and the analysis of scientific explanation. 1. ANALYSES OF DETERMINISM I shall begin with some rather elementary discussion, since most of the technical treatments start with what seems to me er- roneous or odd definitions of determinism. The backbone of the deterministic thesis in the usual contemporary discussion might best be brought out by asking what it is intended to deny. I take it that it is at least intended to deny the existence of chance events, i.e., essentially random events. Usually, it is taken to deny further that any events are caused by others standing in certain space-time relations to them, such as temporal posteriority or unmediated distance. But there is first a more pressing problem to be attacked: what is meant by "an essentially random event." We have lately heard a great deal about the concept of randomness 2 and the main difficulty with it can be put readily enough. An event is said to be random, it seems, only if it is not part of a regular pattern of events. But there are an infinite number of patterns, i.e., precise generating functions for any finite sequence of events (even assuming each event can be described by a finite number of state-variables). Hence there can be no strictly random events in a finite sequence. This conclusion is much stronger than conclusions about the impossibility of showing or proving that an event is random. Our first inclination is to say that one cannot regard the dis- covery of just any generating function as adequate grounds for asserting that the events are non-random. In the first place, ad hoc functions seem objectionable. We feel that a function devised after the 9,327th event and discarded after the 9,328th has no right to be called a pattern of the sequence. But how can we formulate this condition? We do not know in advance that the function will fail after one trial, so the condition cannot involve reference to that failure. Moreover, a function which works for 9,327 events would have worked at all earlier stages; so in a sense it has received very heavy and repeated confirmation. We can hardly hold it against a function that we happened not to think of it at the beginning of the sequence. 2 G. Spencer Brown, Probability and Scientific Inference, Longmans, 1957.</page><page sequence="3">SYMPOSIUM-DETERMINISM 729 The effect of these difficulties is to put us under pressure to relativize the notion of a chance event. In fact I am convinced that in applied statistics such a move is correct: one should talk about a finite sequence not as "random," but as relatively random with respect to (a) its length; (b) certain patterns, e.g., excess of single digits, ordered triples, etc.; (c) some standard of acceptable devia- tion from the mean chance expectation. But in dealing with the thesis of determinism, acceptance of such a relativization would surely amount to capitulation by the indeterminist. For if there is no categorical predicate " random " then it would seem there could never be any certainty about the identification of a chance event. This conclusion is too strong, as it stands. But it does bring out an apparent asymmetry of the two positionas which is important for understanding the " regulative principle " interpretation of determinism. It appears that determinism is not susceptible to disproof in the usual way of an empirical generalization or a mathematical generalization like Goldbach 's hypothesis (that every even number is the sum of two prime numbers). For there is no such observation as "seeing that an event is purely random." But the procedure of disproving highly theoretical scientific state- ments such as the law of the conservation of mass-energy is by no means a matter of single observations. We may agree that both the determinist and the conservationist theses are logically equivalent to the denial of a single counter-example; but this is con- sistent with saying that (a) specific single observations can do no more than make them improbable, and (b) other considerations- logical or theoretical-may do at least as much. The determinist's thesis is naturally more general than the conservationist's-it is a thesis with consequences for nearly all physical inquiries, not only those involving quantitative techniques. But it is still an empir- ical thesis, in the usual interpretation. Moreover, in no interpreta- tion is it really inviolable in a way different from the indeterminist's thesis; for just as the determinist can continue to say that a cause may still be found for a certain event, so the hardened indeter- minist can continue to say that the best evidence for a particular causal ascription may turn out to be entirely fortuitous, a statisti- cal artifact. Either position eventually becomes unreasonable or vacuous in the face of mounting counter-considerations, enumerative (e.g., the repeated failure to find causes) and abstract (e.g., the inconsistency of alternative theories, the philosophical similarity to the Aristotle-Galileo issue). The most serious abstract consideration is Russell's version of the randomness point we have already raised. At every moment in</page><page sequence="4">730 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the world's history every parameter has a value. Define the Russell functioll as the set of correlations of that value with that time for each parameter. Then the world obeys the law expressed by the Russell function; and this holds for all possible worlds. Hence determinism is necessarily true. Against this I wish to say that the concept of a law of nature is such as to exclude completely a wide range of mathematically possible functions-and the indeterminist's thesis asserts that some events are not wholly law-governed. Laws are not merely general propositions, nor are they general propositions in which no singular terms occur non-vacuously, nor are they those propositions which justify contrary-to-fact conditionals. Climatic laws, lin- guistic laws, and perhaps Kepler 's laws provide exceptions to these conditions; but here I need a different point from the logic of laws. Take two unrelated laws L' and L", and form their con- junction L = L' + L". Now, confirming a law entitles one to re- gard deductions from it as more likely; but confirming L via con- firming L' does not increase the probability of those deductions which are instantiations of L". Hence L is not a law. A fortiori, one might argue, the Russell function is not a law. But this appears invalid. L' is equivalent to the set of its in- stances, and confirming any of these confirms L': is not the same true of the Russell-function? In the first place L' is not (and the Russell function is) logically equivalent to the set of its instances in the way L is equivalent to L' + L", since its instances may well be infinite (in the usual misleading formalization they are always infinite). Secondly, the instances of L' share a common formal structure with L' in a way that is wholly untrue of L or the Russell-function and their instances. It is this feature which pro- vides a good reason for the "rule of inference" way of talking about laws. The instances of laws are, and the instances of some universal propositions are not, examples of applying a rule. Con- versely, it is only when they are instances of a law that observa- tions confirm that law: instances of true prediction using a Rus- sell-function do not directly confirm it, as a law; they at best con- firm its continued use for making predictions via a secondary hypothesis, e.g., that it originated from an omnipotent God. This distinction is important and not easy to make in a short space. Per- haps I can best bring it out by asking you whether you would re- gard the existence of a successful prophet as proof that the world was deterministic. It seems to me clear that it is logically per- fectly possible to have a precognitive agent in an indeterminist world, i.e., the mere fact that someone can predict successfully does not establish determinism. It is not even enough to require</page><page sequence="5">SYMPOSIUM-DETERMINISM 731 a rational method for predicting, since we can quite rationally use the clairvoyant as an instrument. Determinism is only indirectly about predictability, and having a successful clairvoyant or the Russell-function only tells us indirectly about determinism. Clearly the clairvoyant's world is not deterministic unless his own predictions, i.e., utterances, are determined; and there are clearly variations of his world in which his predictions are governed only by the Russell-function, so we may confine our attentions to the latter. Now if we could have this function in advance, we should have some grounds for supposing that the events in the world were determined by the source from which the function came. If no one gave it to us, we would either never see it or, if we did, we would hypothesize that someone had produced it who knew how the world would be and from this we would usually infer that the world had to be that way. If, on the other hand, we found every possible Russell-function lying around, we would never bother to glance at them since we know one of them must be true. Only the second- ary inferences make a Russell-function ever relevant to determinism. With a law in the usual sense, it is not necessary to give hypotheses about its origin in order to justify making an inference with it. When we believe in determinism we believe that laws exist which govern all events and this does not mean merely descriptions of the world (Russell-functions). The further problem arises that there is no sense in which the Russell-function could be given in advance, unless it could be ex- pressed in terms of ordinary laws (tautology) ; and if it cannot be given in advance, it doesn't even look tempting as cannon fodder for a ruthless determinist. This is another way of illustrating the dependence on secondary hypotheses of inferences using the Rus- sell-function: the continued success of laws justifies their continued use, but something else has to be invoked to sustain belief in a function whose prediction for Tuesday has no relation to the one for Monday. All events occur at some time and in some place, and could be foreseen; but this doesn't show they're law-governed, just that they 're events. Russell 's move to determinism is via predictability, and that requires advance possession of an un- summarizable infinitely long function.3 3 Suppose the world contains a ten-sided die only, and that this succes- sively illuminates one of its faces, following the digits in the expansion of pi. Is it deterministic? I think we would want to say it was, even though the sense in which a finite summary could be given is obscure. But the Russell-function sophistry applies to every sequence of digits including those for which the nth digit is not recursively accessible except via the function; and that accessibility is illegal (i.e., not according to law).</page><page sequence="6">732 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY I conclude that Philipp Frank is overly critical when he sup- poses the Russell argument shows that determinism is vague un- less the exact form of the laws is given. There may be borderline cases-I shall raise some in a moment-but Russell-functions are nowhere near the borderline. To discover a law is not to discover the data, it is to discover a pattern in the data. Frank thinks that a possible exception could be made if reference was made, not to the exact form of laws, but to the existence of a Laplacean Intelligence. But the Laplacean account of determinism is radi- cally unsound. Apart from the fact that it also involves the notion of law ("force," in his original formulation) and hence is no better off, it is at best a consequence of determinism and at worst en- tirely vacuous; for it is about the performance of a queer entity, an Intelligence, and determinism is not usually conceived to be a thesis about Intelligences. If the reply is made that "determin- istic" is a dispositional property of universes, as "stable" is of certain physical systems, meaning that certain operations (examina- tion and calculation by an Intelligence) produce certain results, the difficulty is not avoided. For such an analysis logically in- volves a law about Intelligences which is surely not intended. In fact, the concept of Intelligence is so vague that it is likely to be simply an anthropomorphic disguise for a condition of effective calculability on the laws, and hence returns us to the unvarnished account. Furthermore, the Laplacean account would also rule out some worlds which we would regard as deterministic. Suppose, for example, that some variable in the world assumes a certain con- stant value for all even dates of the month and increases logarith- mically during all odd dates, on each odd date picking up where it left off at midnight twenty-four hours before. There would of course be a discontinuous change in the variable every midnight, but a perfectly predictable one, of varying but bounded size. Should we not regard such behavior as deterministic? If so, then we must consider the possibility that all the state-variables act in this way. If they did, then Laplace's Intelligence would need more than the present state of the Universe and the laws govern- ing it: we would also need to know the date and the hour. Now, one can rightly be puzzled how it could be determined that the whole Universe obeyed such a law when no time-measuring de- vices could possibly do so. I must reply that for a long time I fervently wished that the possibility could be dismissed as mean- ingless in this way, but I have now regretfully concluded that good scientific reasons could be given for its occurrence, and that modern cosmology certainly countenances similar possibilities. The ex-</page><page sequence="7">SYMPOSIUM-DETERMINISM 733 tremely important result follows from this case that we cannot suppose "like effect follows like cause" to be an adequate analysis of determinism. For the state A at 11:55 p.m. on even dates is followed by the identical state A, whereas the state A five minutes later is followed by the very different state B, the initial state of the odd date. (It is tempting but entirely contrary to physical practice to regard the time-variable as a state-variable; and this is one of the crucial respects in which relativity has not made time into "just another dimension.") As far as I can see, this kind of example invalidates a good deal of the discussion in the literature on the causal principle; I have in mind particularly Chapter 12 of Philipp Frank's recent and valuable book, The Philosophy of Science. Moreover, this cannot be saved by adding a condition of continuity, since the exam- ple given can readily be amended to provide continuous transitions from step to step. I described it in the more acute form partly because I wanted simultaneously to undermine the connection be- tween determinism and continuity. It should be noted that even discontinous behavior such as that described does not violate the requirement, which we are not discussing, that a body cannot be in two places (states) at the same time. Nor, contrary to appearances, can I see any way in which it violates the theory of relativity; but even if it does so as described, it can easily be modified to conform. In the light of these considerations we can comment quite briefly on the situation in physics. 2. TmH PRESENT PHYSICAL EVIDENCE Once we see that the discovery of exact determination of an incomplete description of the world does not guarantee determin- ism, we are in a position to deal with one of the suggestions made about determinism in modern physics. If a roulette wheel always spins so as to keep the sum of two out of any three successive numbers exactly equal to 40, then we have a precise determination of an incomplete description; given the sequence 7, 23, 17, we do not know which number will occur next. In quantum physics, we have a statistical function, the +-func- tion, which characteristically obeys certain exact transformation rules, incorporated in the Schrodinger equation. It has been argued, by Nagel, that in an important sense this should be de- scribed as a form of determinism. Yet the +-function definitely does not enable one to make exact predictions about macroscopi- cally observable events such as scintillations, particle tracks, and Geiger counter clicks. It is the theme of my argument in this</page><page sequence="8">734 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY paper that determinism is not a matter of degree and is not re- lative to specific variables. Consequently I would have to regard the precise behavior of the +-function as of no more help to a determinist than the sum-function in the preceding example about the roulette wheel. The only vagueness in the deterministic thesis is the concept of event, and this is not at issue when a scintillation or a click is under consideration. Now might one not argue that in the history of science we have commonly and correctly abandoned the search for certain methods of prediction, not succeeded with them? The attempt to predict fortunes by horoscopes would be a case in point. Might not quantum physics provide a further example? But there is a crucial difference between the two elements of this comparison. Astrology claimed to be able to predict certain phenomena P on the basis of a certain class of data D. We abandoned this claim indeed, but we still believe P is predictable on the basis of some other data D'. But quantum physics is able to give us very good reasons for supposing that P cannot be predicted on the basis of any D. We not only can't do it, but we can give strong arguments to show that it can never be done. So in this case, and not in the astrology case, we are tempted to abandon the thesis of determinism, not only the thesis of the ineffective theory; in this case, and not in the astrology case, we cannot count the failure of the theory to predict P as a defect of the theory, since the theory itself makes no claim to do so. It may well be that we should abandon the at- tempt to predict P (for conceptual, not practical reasons); but we must realize that in this case the cost is enormously greater. Now one may ask how it can be that a theory can give reasons for supposing that certain predictions cannot be made. Is this not reminiscent of a theory about that most fascinating of all sub- stances, ectoplasm, a theory which contains the assertion that it vanishes in any light strong enough to see it by? This surely contravenes scientific method. This is a particularly interesting question and one that has been discussed in great technical detail. Let me indicate only briefly the lines of argument as I see them. It has commonly been asserted that there exists in quantum mechanics a categorical proof, the von Neumann proof, that no determinist theory is possible. Now if this proof starts from quantum mechanical premises, then it would clearly be possible to ignore it if one was prepared to con- sider alternative premises; and to consider a determinist theory would be to do just that. In fact, it does start from premises which are part of quantum mechanics; but two difficulties present themselves before we can cheerfully retain determinism and set</page><page sequence="9">SYMPOSIUMI-DETERMINISM 735 about discovering respectable deterministic theories. The first is that we have staggeringly strong evidence for the premises; strong enough, it seems to me, to immediately throw into doubt the deterministic thesis. The second difficulty is that alternative theories which begin from premises sufficiently close to those of quantum physics to be worth empirical consideration, and which nevertheless retain a deterministic appearance, have all failed to maintain that appearance upon closer scrutiny. Let me make clear the difference between these difficulties. The evidence as it stands is such as to lend very great weight to the quantum-mechanical descriptions; and from these descriptions there necessarily follows (by the von Neumann proof) the inde- terministic nature of the phenomena. That is, it would be logi- cally inconsistent to accept these, the most plausible descriptions of sub-atomic processes, and maintain that there exist some under- lying deterministic variables of which the quantum theory vari- ables are manifestations (in somewhat the way that statistical measures of a population are manifestations of an underlying set of individual variables which could be entirely deterministic). The second difficulty involves no question of logical inconsistency within a theory; it is a matter of two lines of plausibility reason- ing. For a theory of micro-events to be plausible at all in the face of present evidence, there are certain relationships which it must incorporate, either as approximations or as exact laws. (Nor is the evidence of a kind which may prove to have been mistaken; only the very grossest features of the very simplest experiments, e.g., in spectroscopy and photoelectricity, repeated many hun- dreds of times, are here involved.) For the theory to be further- more deterministic and to provide interpretations of the many and various supposedly quantum phenomena, there are only a limited number of ways in which it can mathematically be de- veloped; and there are very strong reasons for supposing that none of these withstand thorough elaboration. This second diffi- culty has been expounded most convincingly by Groenewold in several papers and discussions. To give a specific example, one might, following an early suggestion by Bohm, wish to talk of quantum mechanics as an extension of classical mechanics in the sense that it involves only the addition of a quantum potential to the classical potentials in the equations of motion. The equations appear thereby to preserve their deterministic character. But closer examination discloses that the new potential is unfortu- nately not susceptible to independent measurement; in fact, it already incorporates at least one of the state-variables which we hope to obtain from the equation in which it occurs. Hence it</page><page sequence="10">736 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY is not significantly more deterministic than any "law" which "governs" a variable by saying "it is what it is"; and certainly it is not as satisfactory as the Russell function, apart from its greater simplicity. That there remains the logical possibility of devising a deterministic theory of the sub-quantum level is ad- mitted when we refer to the above considerations as plausibility considerations; and Bohm and Vigier, amongst others, are follow- ing the guidance of Einstein himself in working on such theories. But I shall venture the extremely rash judgment that their activi- ties strike me as very similar to that of the Cartesians, who, faced with Newton's proof that a theory of vortices could not account for Kepler's Laws, set about finding something near enough that would be good enough. Their honorable failure marked the in- troduction not merely of an alternative theory of celestial motion, but of an alternative method of physical explanation. Contact- action as an explanatory necessity was abandoned for (or at least fundamentally transformed into) field-action. Just as the Cartesians could have "saved" their view by mak- ing the ether intangible, so it is possible to "save" classical physics in the quantum field by extraordinary assumptions, e.g., instantane- ous transmission of causally efficacious influences from slits in screens to particles located at vast distances from the screen (Reichenbach). But not only are such assumptions wholly unjustified except as expedients for saving classical concepts, the exact set required shows signs of straightforward inconsistency, and has certainly never been formulated in a way that would salvage determinism. In short, this would not save determinism because (a) it would sacri- fice truth and (b) possibly also consistency. We now come to a wholly independent argument against the view that quantum physics is in a sense still deterministic. It is in fact not the case that even the +-function obeys deterministic laws. While this is true in many situations, including cases of strong interaction, it fails to be so in what are referred to as "measurements," the term being here used in a somewhat technical sense. Now it is not possible to support this statement fully in this paper. I owe my belief in its truth and my understanding of the arguments supporting it to Paul Feyerabend, and they re- present a modification of his position in the paper "On the Quan- tum Theory of Measurement" in the 1957 Colston Society Sym- posium "Observation and Interpretation." One may mention that there are a number of ways in which it appears possible to save the deterministic character of the +-function, e.g., by deal- ing with the +-function of the observer-plus-observed system, but they all seem to me subject to irremediable flaws. The question of</page><page sequence="11">SYMPOSIUM-DETERMINISM 737 how best to interpret these indeterministic " jumps " is an ex- ceedingly interesting one; the Born interpretation of the measure- ment as causing the jump, the counter-paradox of the Schrodinger cat apparently killed by the " measurement" of looking to see whether a photon-operated gun has shot it or not, the use of a theorem of von Neumann's to show that one can consistently as- sert its earlier death, the paradoxes of Einstein-Podolski-Rosen and the standing-wave electron, the new attempts (Ludwig, Feyera- bend) to represent the transition to a mixture (the "jump") as an approximating step, these moves and counter-moves provide a kicking example of conceptual reorientation of the greatest in- terest, discussed at some length by Griinbaum in the preceding paper. But the serious difficulties here are nearly all irrelevant to the determinism issue; nearly all the positions alluded to accept the indeterministic jump in one form or another and put forward a particular account of it. At least we can say there are grave objections to the view that quantum physics is derivatively de- terministic even if we assume that this would be true if the f- function always obeyed the Schrbdinger equation. I should like to go into some other aspects of the determinism problem in physics, especially the question of retarded potentials (Feynmann) and the reversal of the causal order, and the kind of cosmological model which raises in acute form the time problem. But I wish to go on to some brief comments on two quite different points of great importance to a consideration of the present status of determinism, so I shall simply sum up my judgments on the purely physical side, for what they are worth, by saying that physics today seems heavily and rightly committed to a clearly indeterministic form. This is a conceptual change of a more funda- mental kind than most-and perhaps all-that have gone before, because the new physics offers no substitute for the answers it cannot give. Instead of showing us that the questions were inap- propriate (cf., Why does a body continue to move in a straight line under no forces?), or in need of further analysis before an answer could be given (cf., Why does man alone have the power of reason ?), it claims simply that this world is not one in which the troublesome questions have any exact answer at all (When will this atom radiate?). For this claim it appears to me to have the best of reasons. 3. HUMAN FREEDOM AND DETERMINISM IN PHYSICS I hasten to say that I am not reopening (or reclosing) the ques- tion whether quantum uncertainty allows freedom of the will. I</page><page sequence="12">738 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY presently regard this question as settled in the negative, not so much because this could not be the case, but because it does not seem to me the correct reason for believing in free will. If I have correctly described the status of determinism in physics, what can be said about determinism in psychology and hence (perhaps) in ethics ? It will not do at all to regard freedom (of the will) as the absence of external compulsion, simply because we do not regard the drug addict and the claustrophobe as having free choice with respect to certain alternatives which in no way involve external compulsion. What characterizes these people is the inevitability, the predeterminedness, of their actions in a situation which they may believe is a choice. (This inadequacy of the subjective criterion of choice is particularly clear with the post-hypnotic subject.) One might identify this inevitability with ineffective- ness of punishment in such cases; "free" means "responsible" which means "such that punishment (or reward) is appropriate, i.e., effective." This development collapses under the fire of such examples as the resistance hero who remains silent while being tortured to death; punishment does not alter his behavior, yet we wish to say he is fully responsible and hence heroic. The crucial difference here, it seems to me, is that we want to say the tortured man could have spoken if he so desired and could so desire, whereas at least one of these descriptions is not true of the neurotic and hypnotic subjects. But, the determinist may reply, it is not true that the underground hero could have desired to give away his secret; given his background and his circumstances his behavior was completely determined. Now, if physics is indeterministic, we must modify this claim. But we modify it in a way which does not directly assist the libertarian, for, as far as we know, unde- termined events occur randomly with respect to choice situations; and only if a correlation could be demonstrated would it be at all possible to argue for a connection between physical indeterminism and moral freedom. Even then the Hobart argument must be met, viz., such events would not be the responsibility of the subject, simply because they were undetermined, i.e., out of character. But there is no great difficulty in meeting this argument by means of a distinction between wholly inexplicable acts and physically but not morally inexplicable acts; the argument is really much too strong to be true. I revert to the determinists' original onslaught. This argu- ment also proves too much. It involves a slide on the word "could" somewhat similar to that involved in arguing that no one person's decisions ever bring about a war because so many other conditions</page><page sequence="13">SYMPOSIUMI-DETERMINISM 739 are also necessary to bring it about; here it is "bring about" that suddenly slips through our grasp. The solutions of the two cases are similar; we decide whether the man in question could have decided otherwise, and could have done otherwise had he decided otherwise, by empirical tests which ultimately will involve treat- ment of the central nervous system as an information flow pattern.4 To discover that the man could have decided otherwise is no more exciting or logically difficult than to discover that a train smash could have been averted (if the switchman had been awake) or that a certain forest fire could have wiped out a certain city (if the fire fighters had not reached it by plane). The compulsive is characterized by the fact that, in the extreme case, he could not have decided otherwise; he had no freedom of choice or will. Hence, even though a contrary decision would have produced a different action, we do not regard him (here) as wholly responsible. Similarly, in the conceivable but virtually unknown case of the man who is a prisoner in his own body, and to a lesser extent in cases of physical defect, we recognize that the decision was free but not causally efficacious, i.e., the man could not have done other- wise even if he had decided otherwise. A notion of partial re- sponsibility is of course required for an adequate treatment of psychological determinism and moral blame; the cripple is less responsible for knocking over the Ming vase than the physically well man, the child from the slums is less to blame, at first, for moral transgressions. But the awful innocence of the determinist 's denizens is a logical myth like the terrible helplessness of the fatalist 's meditators. To say one's choice was free is to say that it could have been otherwise, but only if we insist on the same cause-same effect thesis does it necessarily follow that the choice would have been otherwise only if circumstances were different (cf. "Two identical radium atoms in identical circumstances can radiate at different times"). Of course, it is highly relevant to establish that different circumstances would have led to a different choice; but this is an evidential approach to, not a logical equiva- lent of, freedoimi of choice. The essential point about "could have done otherwise " is its context-dependence; there are no simple context-independent rules for deciding when it applies. But this in no way invalidates its utility and its meaningfulness in given circumstances, in physics or in law, and it is the cornerstone of morality. I conclude that determinism's demise in physics facili- tates belief in but does not underwrite freedom of the will. I 4I am greatly indebted to Donald McKay for discussions of this issue, especially the communications theory aspects.</page><page sequence="14">740 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY could have concluded otherwise just as this could have been a better paper and we all could have given more to charity last year. (But, I hasten to add, it would have been unreasonable of me to have concluded otherwise, whereas the other alternatives would probably not have been unreasonable!) 4. DETERMINISTIC AND PROBABILISTIC EXPLANATION In conclusion I want to say a very few words about the pay-off of the determinism issue, not in ethics, but in explaining. Granted that a very circumscribed set of requests for explanation in physics must be abandoned, are there any other effects of in- determinism on explanation? The question is reminiscent of those which suggest profound results are bound to follow in every field if extra-sensory percep- tion or even psychokinesis were established. For us traders in concepts, such discoveries are indeed important, and for certain limited areas in the relevant sciences also important; but relativity affected the timing of horse races about as much as quantum mechanics affects explanation (or, I would add, free will). This is more easily seen if we realize that there are virtually no laws in physics which are thought to be literally true. Snell's Law, Hooke's Law, Newton's Laws, the Laws of Thermodynamics, Kepler's Laws, none of them are better than approximations and then only over a certain range of conditions. It is thus of neg- ligible consequence for explanations involving such laws that strict determinism does not hold. All that is affected is our belief that we could explain-one day-every deviation from these laws, a merely programmatic change. Moreover, this is not even a very ex- citing programmatic change for the working scientist in, say, hydro- dynamics or friction research, because there would never have been for him any possibility at all of fulfilling this program. He is unaffected by the change. More generally we can say that the search for causes is not affected (except in micro-physics), since the occasional undetermined events cannot be identified as such with- out exhaustive examination of possible causal accounts. In this sense-as a prescriptive rule for the researcher-determinism is not generally undermined. That there may not be a cause is no guarantee that there is not one. The appeal of the deductive model of explanation is thus, I feel, largely illusory and in consequence little real damage is done to the actual procedure of explanation by the loss of deterministic laws. Indeed, as I have argued elsewhere, it seems to me apparent that in the explanation of much behavior and many historical</page><page sequence="15">SYMPOSIUM-NATURE OF ANALYSIS 741 events we cannot regard the deductive model as even an ideal. The deterministic laws there, we can say with confidence, would be- if they existed-so complex that measuring the relevant variables would be far beyond our evidential resources. Consequently we adopt probabilistic explanation as the appropriate kind for those fields; since the fields are defined in terms of the kind of evidence available (history is necessarily not a special subsection of neuro- physiology), it is self-contradictory to speak of deductive determin- istic explanations as an ideal for history. It seem to me clear that the same is generally-though not quite universally-true in physics. The nature of correspondence rules, bridge laws, models, the undefinability of theoretical con- structs, the space-time continuum framework, all these and many other factors intrinsic to an understanding of physics necessitate the use of non-deductive probabilistic explanation. So that de- terminism in physics is not only dead but hardly mourned. MICHAEL SCRIVEN SWARTHMORE COLLEGE</page></plain_text>
