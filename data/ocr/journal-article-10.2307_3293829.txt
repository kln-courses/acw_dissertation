<plain_text><page sequence="1">Venus and Aeneas The Difficulties of Filial Pietas W HO WILL DENY that, of all the im- mortals, Venus is the most baf- fling? We may identify her most closely with the universal creative impulse, as did Lucretius,1 or think in Freudian terms of a basic drive in men's natures; but the symbol remains complex and unpredictable. This article attempts to show that Venus was a problem, in different ways, both to Vergil and to pius Aeneas, and that the problem is left unresolved, though its literary handling reveals unsuspected humor and perceptiveness. We must begin where Vergil began, with Homer. The Iliad2 states flatly that Aineias was the son of Anchises and the goddess Aphrodite. The Homeric Aphrodite, wife of Hephaestus, certainly bore no resemblance at all to a demure Roman materfamilias: the court bard's after-dinner story of her entanglement with the war-god Ares furnishes one of the most Rabelaisian episodes in all of Homer. The Greek literary view of her character, once formed, did not radically change. Plato might argue brilliantly to give her a dual nature of sensual and spiritual love, but to Euripides3 Aphro- dite and her child, the dreaming youth Eros, were capricious and all too often destructive in their terrible power.4 Even Thucydides,5 writing of the Athen- ians' fatal passion to sail against Syra- cuse, says, "Eros fell upon them all."6 During the Hellenistic period her repu- tation becomes worse still: "She is," as the French critic Cartault7 puts it, "the ... instigator of all the most abandoned amatory excesses, she delights in cor- rupting men and bringing them un- happiness." Long before Vergil's time, this dis- turbing lady of easy virtue8 had been forcibly identified in Roman religion with an inoffensive garden-goddess.9 The link was a Sicilian divinity, wor- shipped at Mt. Eryx, whom Greeks called Aphrodite and who received tem- ples in Rome as Venus Erucina.10 H. J. Rose11 suggests that the word venus originally denotes the beauty of well- tilled land such as garden land, and there seems no doubt that the Italic goddess Venus was simply one of the vegetation-deities.12 So primitive a re- ligious conception, without personality or myth, is easily overwhelmed and supplanted by an anthropomorphic deity; thus, when a Roman of the early Augustan period heard Venus' name, the image arising in his mind was hardly to be distinguished from that of the Greek Aphrodite. In this situation Vergil knew what must be done if Venus was not to appear wholly absurd as Aeneas' mother and source of the Julian house. We are bound to acknowledge the gen- eral success of her transformation;13 the question is rather whether the ex- tent of the transformation has been correctly estimated. We find M. Car- tault14 maintaining that the Venus of the Aeneid is simply a tender, affec- tionate, solicitous mother with no am- bition to be anything else. We find Mr. Cyril Bailey,15 that brilliant student of Roman religion, saying, "Venus and Iuno at least have no personality and no aims of their own ... ; they are . . . the workings of the opposed moirai." According to such judgments, the patroness of wanton desire has changed into a colorless paragon of matronly respectability, shining only with re- flected light as Aeneas' mother and as the instrument of a benevolent destiny. One hears again the words of Quince when he perceives that his friend has grown a donkey's head: "Bless thee, Bottom, bless thee! thou art trans- lated." It may be worth our while to deter- mine just how well the Aeneid bears out 233</page><page sequence="2">W. D. ANDERSON such opinions. Venus observed appears clearly to Aeneas once only, in Book 3; but this brief encounter tells us little about the goddess and her relationship with her son. Vergil does reveal her at length to us (though not to Aeneas) in Book 1; and so, if we would understand her, we must follow Aeneas and the in- evitable Achates through a dense forest on the once green shores of North Africa. Let C. Day Lewis16 tell the story: There, from the heart of the woodland, his mother came to meet him Guised as a maiden in face and dress, with a girl's weapons- A Spartan girl, as it might be, or Thracian Harpalyce, Outpacer of horses, swift outrunner of run- ning rivers. In huntress wise she had handily slung her bow from her shoulder, And her hair was free to blow in the wind, and she went bare-kneed With the flowing folds of her dress kilted up and securely knotted.17 Since the deities of Homer and Vergil almost never reveal themselves in propria natura, one is not surprised to find Venus masquerading as someone else; but what a disguise she has chosen! A trace of the divine splendor remains, as too powerful to hide com- pletely; every other detail represents a determined attempt by the ravishing goddess of love to appear her exact opposite.18 The iron physical training of Spartan girls might well make them tough, mannish and unkempt. Romans, on the other hand, expected freeborn women to have their hair put up neatly and to wear long, modest robes. The fierce Amazon, typified in Vergil most closely by the doomed Camilla,19 caught the fancy of Graeco-Roman and Augustan times, but this type remained bizarre. At the mention of Harpalyce, more- over, an educated Roman with his mythology well polished would recall that she grew up in the woods, living there alone and stealing a lamb from the sheepfolds when she was driven by hunger. If Venus, in this strange mani- festation, reminded one of a brawny Spartan girl or of the wild, wolf-like Harpalyce, we may take it she made a formidable figure. Sed quorsus haec? The point is that Aeneas' mother has decided to play a joke on him, nothing malicious or even particularly subtle, but (as Aeneas' later words clearly show) the same trick of impersonation which has suc- ceeded with him a number of times before.20 Many of Vergil's readers will have seen this for themselves; the com- mentators, however, have so consistent- ly ignored it that one may perhaps be pardoned for laboring the obvious. As Vergil continues his narrative, the deception is strengthened by words: "She spoke first: - Hullo there, young men! If you have seen One of my sisters roving hereabouts or in full cry After a foaming boar - she carries a slung quiver And wears a spotted lynx-skin -please tell where she went. Thus Venus spoke; and the son of Venus began to reply thus: - No sight or sound have I had of any of your sisters, O - but what shall I call you, maiden? for your face is Unmortal, and your speech rings not of humankind. Goddess surely you are. A nymph? The sister of Phoebus? Give luck, whoever you be! Lighten, I pray, our ordeal!"21 Professor Day Lewis' excellent ren- dering of heus, iuvenes as "Hullo there, young men!" is likely to be misunder- stood on this side of the Atlantic. Heus, like the British colloquialism which translates it, is a somewhat sharp and decidedly informal request for atten- tion, not a greeting. It occurs almost exclusively in Plautus and Terence, where it is the regular summons for a servant to come and open the door. Vergil uses it twice only; the other example, also from the Aeneid, is found 234</page><page sequence="3">VENUS AND AENEAS in Ascanius' joking words heus, etiam mensas consumimus,22 spoken when the hungry Trojans have fallen to eat- ing the thin meal-cakes on which the other food had been heaped. There can be no doubt about the light tone here, since Vergil says the youth spoke adludens, in jest. Translated into American, what Venus calls out to Aeneas and Achates is simply "Hey!" Ascanius' words, by the same token, are "Hey! we're even eating the tables!" In the present passage, as in the other, heus witnesses to a tempo- rarily relaxed and humorous approach by Vergil. Ac prior heus, inquit, iuvenes: Venus speaks first, because she is the one in command of the situation.23 Aeneas' reply echoes in some degree the words of Odysseus to Nausicaa. The obvious borrowing, which editors invariably point out, is valuable for us only be- cause it suggests something which editors seem invariably to overlook, namely the striking difference between the conduct of Odysseus and of Aeneas in parallel situations. The Ithacan is lying naked and battered on the sand when the sound of girls' voices rouses him from sleep. He plans a course of action, improvises a covering and pro- ceeds to address Nausicaa in one of the great diplomatic speeches of all time. Aeneas at his best acts with the straightforwardness of a true Roman, but he quite lacks the resourceful na- ture of Odysseus. We find Homer's hero more interesting; Roman readers undoubtedly found Aeneas more ad- mirable. At any rate, he answers the hoyden huntress24 with commendable polite- ness. There is one difficulty: he does not know this young lady's identity. O - quam te memorem, virgo? The turn of phrase is colloquial, for stately lan- guage would not express his embarrass- ment.25 Aeneas senses that he has en- countered no ordinary mortal; he asks if she is Phoebus' sister, or perhaps one of the nymphs. The loca deserta in which he finds himself would seem a likely place to come upon nymphs, whom the Romans associated with caves, springs and not least with dense forests;26 also, Aeneas has just come from a seaside cave which Vergil calls nympharum domus, the sort of place where they might dwell. But another guess is ventured, name- ly that the young lady is Diana; and this is what Venus really wanted Aeneas to think. Her words and appearance very strongly suggest the Diana of Graeco-Roman sculpture;27 thus when Dido is likened to the divine huntress, later in Book 1,28 Vergil pictures Diana with a quiver over her shoulder and surrounded by a band of mountain- nymphs. The latter point perhaps ex- plains the reference Venus makes to her sorores, companions in the hunt. On this new interpretation, Aeneas' conjec- tures are connected, so that in effect he is asking, "Are you one of the nymphs? or perhaps their leader herself?" However that may be, we have no cause to laugh at his perfectly natural surmise; the joke is a private one which Venus, until the very last moment, shares with herself alone.29 No one else, least of all Aeneas, could properly appreciate the magnificent incongruity of Diana, the fiercely virgin goddess, being impersonated by her complete opposite. To stress the paradox of her disguise, Vergil begins his description of it with the line virginis os habi- tumque gerens et virginis arma, where the repetition puzzles editors because the real reason for its use has gone un- noticed. Good taste prevails, to be sure, for virgo is contrasted, both ex- plicitly and implicitly, with the idea of motherhood;30 but in Augustan thought Venus' scandalous behavior had not been forgotten simply because Julius and Augustus adopted her as patroness and genetrix. Once again, incidentally, an echo of Homer31 has fallen on deaf ears: when Telemachus comes to the court of Mene- laus and Helen, she who at Troy had 235</page><page sequence="4">W. D. ANDERSON been the most seductive of all women is deliberately likened to Artemis. No humor lurks here; Homer is unflinch- ingly realistic, as Tolstoi was to be when he allowed the radiant Natasha to become fat and boring. In this pene- tration, each transcends Vergil. After Aeneas laments his misfortunes Venus comforts him tenderly with news of a good omen. Here are her final words and the scene that follows: "Do but fare on, and firmly step where the road leads you. She spoke. She turned away; and as she turned, her neck Glowed to a rose-flush, her crown of am- brosial hair breathed out A heavenly fragrance, her robe flowed down, down to her feet, And in gait she was all a goddess. Aeneas recognised His mother, and as she passed from him, sent these words in her wake: Must you too be cruel? Must you make game of your son With shapes of sheer illusion? Oh, why may we not join Hand to hand, or ever converse straight- forwardly? Thus he reproached her, and turned his steps toward the battlements."32 We have here a rarely beautiful de- scription of the revelation of divinity. Aeneas, comforted now with hope for the future, might have accepted the revelation with some tranquillity; but in fact he cries out like a vexed child, and the interchange closes on a note which seems to us somewhat odd. It must have seemed so in the fourth cen- tury as well; for Donatus, author of the Interpretationes Vergilianae, carefully explains that "the reproach is not abu- sive or bitter, but shows (Aeneas') religio and his emotion." Since religio here does not mean "religious awe", it is quite possible that Donatus was re- ferring to Aeneas' sense of propriety, his scrupulous feeling for ethical obli- gations. If so, then we must say, tetigisti acu: you have hit the nail on the head, Donatus. Before any explanation of Aeneas' reproach can be attempted, his pietas must be briefly considered. The terms pietas and pius seldom refer in the Aeneid to anything except religious de- votion; and yet that of course is not quite the whole story. We think at once of Aeneas' pietas erga patrem, his duti- ful care towards Anchises. Now, An- chises is peevish in his old age- one wonders, indeed, what Venus saw in him at any age- nevertheless Aeneas proves an admirably patient and re- spectful son; pius and pietas are used again and again of his attitude. What, then, of the fact that in the entire Aeneid neither term is ever used to describe Aeneas' relations with his mother? Surely it must be concluded that these ideas would not fit into the rela- tionship. From Aeneas' point of view, Venus was simply impossible: at Troy she was never home, so that one might as well not have a mother; and when she did appear it was likely to be in some maddening disguise, and one didn't get a chance to have a real talk with her. Quid natum totiens, crudelis tu quoque, falsis / Ludis imaginibus? he cries. "The hand of the whole world is turned against me, and now you, my own mother, cruel too! Why can't we be open and natural with each other?" It is a little childish, if you like; it is also pathetic. Aeneas can and does make sacrifice to his mother; but what he wants is to love her, in his queer, stiff way, as a son; and for this, as he himself recognizes, there is no chance -non datur. Venus does love her child, yet she sees the impersonation as a harmless joke. Not so Aeneas; his emotions have been cheated of expres- sion, his sense of the fitness of things is deeply wounded. This whole scene represents an adroit confession on Vergil's part that Venus' nature is too ingrained ever to be changed completely. Not much more than a generation earlier, Lucretius had presented her under a three-fold aspect, as the Aeneadum genetrix, as the cos- 236</page><page sequence="5">VENUS AND AENEAS mic life-impulse and as the impassioned paramour of Mars.33 His lines are magnificent, but they leave one be- wildered. Vergil avoided this degree of error: his Venus is a devoted mother, yet he allows her to show traces of the old, capricious Aphrodite, so that her very complexity, thus acknowledged, makes her seem at the same time more intriguing and, to one reader at least, more credible. Ought we, finally, to feel sorry for Aeneas? Perhaps; but his saving grace is that he does not long indulge in the luxury of feeling sorry for himself. Already he has a well-formed sense of duty, and after the cry of reproach he obeys his mother's final command, set- ting out on the path that leads to Carth- age. Though Venus' misguided schem- ing is now to bring his divine mission into greater peril than it has yet known, though his commitment to that mission is to be tested as never before, we may leave him with confidence as he goes forward to follow out his destiny.

Rose, Ancient Greek Religion [London n.d.], 54); but so was that of Dionysus, whose power Eurip:des so terrifyingly portrays in the Bacchae. 4 Professor Whatmough (CP 49 [1954]. 207), speculating on the origin of Gk. turannos, sug- gests Etr. turan, "i.e., Aphrodite, the tyrant god- dess." 5 6. 24. 3. 6 F. M. Cornford has brilliantly treated the whole passage in Thucydides Mythistoricus (Lon- don 1907). Though his interpretation has been adopted in this particular instance, the present writer is by no means a convert to Cornford's whole thesis. 7 Cartault, A., I'Art de Vergile dans l'Eneide (Paris 1926), 1. 87. 8 Originally Aphrodite was a goddess of the mother-type, as is evident from statuettes found on Cyprus, where she was chief goddess. When she came to the Greek mainland, as Rose points out (op. cit., 53), she could no longer preside over marriage and childbirth (a province already claimed by Hera), but became associated instead with "all that concerns the passion of love." 9 Varro, R.R. 1. 1, Venus as the patroness of gardens; see Victor Basanoff, Les dieux des romains (Paris 1942), 134. Venus even came to preside over the Roman vintage-festival, origin- ally under the patronage of Iuppiter himself. 10 The clearest statement of the original rela- tionship is that of Gilbert Murray, in Four Stages of Greek Religion (New York 1912), 83: "The Korai of Cyprus, Cythera, Corinth, Eryx, and some other places were felt to be one, and be- came absorbed in the great figure of Aphrodite." At Mt. Eryx, as at Corinth, Aphrodite had temple- harlots in her service, a striking indication of the dissimilarity between the Sicilian and the Italic divinities. If one traces these relationships still farther back, it appears that Venus Erucina was none other than the old Phoenician Ashtart (Astarte) of Eryx, for whose worship there we have inscriptional evidence (CIS 135, 140. 1); see L. B. Paton in Hastings' Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics (New York 1916), 2. 117f. This same work (8. 178-180) contains a detailed study by J. B. Carter of Venus' possible Italic origins and her connection with Aphrodite; his work takes account of the theories of Wissowa, Preller and Marquardt, and is still the best treatment in English. 11 Ancient Roman Religion (London n.d). 93. Against this contemporary view must be set the contention of C. H. Toy (Introduction to the History of Religions [New York 1913], 354, n. 1) that an aesthetic perception of nature "would be foreign to early ways of naming deities" and thus must be disallowed in any investigation of the meaning of Venus' name. The present writer is here content to remain a tertius gaudens. 12 M. P. Nilsson (A History of Greek Religion [tr. F. J. Fielden, Oxford 1925], 120) notes that Aphrodite occasionally appears in this same guise: "She is sometimes known as 'the one from the gardens', and she, as well as Artemis and the nymphs, had shrines at the mouth of the Alpheus." For the references, see J. B. Carter (loc. cit.). One conjectures that this fact, so often overlooked, must enter into any explanation of the identification with Venus. [I have thought that the apple, horticultural item and symbol of love (Catullus 2.12, 65.9) respectively, helped the forced identification. (Ed.)] 13 It does not seem to have been noted that the state-cult had provided Vergil with a precedent almost a century earlier. This was the founda- tion, in 114 B.C., of the temple of Venus Verti- cordia ("turner of hearts"-the adjective is of a type extremely rare in Latin; it parallels the Gk. (Aphrodite) apostrophia), an altar having already been erected near the beginning of the second century. Here the goddess is conce-ved as guiding girls and women toward chastity of mind and away from the lawless desire which prior to the founding had brought about the seduction of three Vestal Virgins. W. Warde Fowler's re- marks (The Roman Festivals of the Republic [London 1908], 68) are worth quot'ng here: "If Lvdus can be trusted, the Roman ceremony of April 1 (i.e. the Veneralia) was fouind also in Cvprus. on the same day, with variations in de- tail. If that be so, the addition of the name Verticordia is a curious example of the accretion of a Roman cult-title expressive of domestic morality on a foreign deity of questionable reou- tation." May it not be, however, that the celebra- tion in Cyprus represented a survival of the original indigenous nature of Aphrcdite as a mother-goddess (v.s., n. 8)? 14 op. cit., 88. 15 Religion in Virgil (Oxford 1935), 314. 16 The Aeneid of Virgil (New York 1953).

There could hardly be any more com- plete misunderstanding of the purpose of her disguise. 19 Camilla, it will be not'ced, was under Diana's protection (Aen. 11.582-584). 237</page><page sequence="6">W. D. ANDERSON 20 Richard Heinze, in his widely-known study Virgils epische Technik (Leipzig 1908), 98, actu- ally maintains that in the phrase totiens . . . falsis / ludis imaginibus (Aen. 1.407f.) Vergil "was thinking not of the specific manifestations of Venus but rather of the changing shapes in which Athena approached Odysseus." The reader who will believe this will believe anything. Ad- mittedly, the discrepancy between Books 1 and 3 of the Aeneid in the matter of Venus' character poses a real problem; but that hardly warrants passing off as an imitation of Homer something which in fact cannot (pace Heinze, ib.) be found anywhere in the Odyssey. 21 Aen. 1.321-330. 22 Aen. 7.116. 23 Donatus explains prior on the supposition that Venus had to start the conversation first, since otherwise it might have seemed improper (im- probum) to speak to a lone maiden. Sad to say, this was revived by Cartault (op. cit., 112). 24 James Henry (Aeneidea [Meissen 18921, 1.620) argues that the use of monstrate in 325 shows her request to be respectful; and Day Lewis' rendering of this imperative as "please tell me where she went" indicates much the same view. Actually, there is no evidence that monstrare in itself shows particular respectful- ness. Even Donatus, ad loc., noted Venus' off- hand manner of speech here (illa non tantum specie virginis verum etiam sermone trans- duceret inprudentis). One must grant, however, that it is less impolite than merely brusque. 25 Servius (D): hic o dubitativa, alias optativa. Mackail rightly notes the way in which Vergil imparts a kind of dignity to a phrase from common speech; but it is the general elevation of his style which achieves this. 26 The antique landscape, says Nilsson (op. cit., 118f.), "is saturated with religion in a manner quite foreign to us. . . . Nymphs lived in every cave and fountain." 27 Cartault (loc. cit.) suggests that a sculptured original provided Vergil's inspiration. 28 49Bl01. 2 Helnze (op. cit., 48f.) has seen this very clearly: "It is completely in keeping with Venus' nature, which in Vergil almost always retains signs of a dilatory element even in the most serious moments, that she does not come to the actual facts of the situation right at the begin- ning . . ; it is as if she wanted to enjoy his (Aeneas') astonishment first." 30 Of the 62 occurrences of epithets applied to Venus in the Aeneid. the following freauencies may be listed: genetrix, 6; mater (sc. Aeneae), 6; parens, 7. Aeneas is noted 22 times, in one form or another, as the goddess' son. See Nich- olas Moseley, Characters and. Evithets: a Studut in Verg4l's Aeneid (Diss.

The opening phrase of the poem constitutes a slight corrective to Franz Altheim's view (A History of Roman Religion [tr.

BORN IN 1891, Mierow received bach- elor's, master's and doctor's degrees from Princeton; and verses from his hand are carved over the entrance of McCosh Hall there. The first incumbent of the Moses Clement Gile chair of Classics at Colorado College, he taught there for twenty-five years, retiring in 1943 but continuing to reside in Colorado Springs, where he died November 15th. Soon after being granted the doctor- ate, he was Harrison Research Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, his subject, "Euripides' Innovations in Athenian Tragedy." Not long since MSS from both him and his brother were in my hands. The latter's paper, though competent, being somewhat marginal to the interests of our readers, he wrote urging me to return that and print his brother's. Charles and I are especially glad now that this was done. "The Amazing Modernity of Euripides" appeared in the Journal of April, 1953. Besides his articles in Classical and other organs, Dr. Mierow published poems, one on the editorial page of the New York Times, and several poetic dramas. Our sympathy goes to his brother, President of Colorado College while his brother was head of Classics there and now again residing at Colorado Springs.
