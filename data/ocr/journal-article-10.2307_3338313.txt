Society for Latin American Studies The Mexican Revolution: Bourgeois? Nationalist? Or just a 'Great Rebellion'? ALAN KNIGHT University ofEssex What kind of revolution was the Mexican Revolution? The nature of the ques? tion is such that any answer?especially a brief answer like this?must be tentative: for it involves not only consideration of a broad and complex historical process (on which there may be major empirical disagreements) but also the application of appropriate theories or organising concepts (on which a priori assumptions may radically differ). Historical arguments, of course, are never entirely empirical, and always depend on the application of some exogenous theories/concepts/'laws': overt theoretical constructs (Marxism, modernization or dependency theory), Hempelian 'covering laws', or?covering laws decked out in fustian?the maxims of 'common sense'. As regards some historical questions, exogenous 'theory' is at a discount: 'the facts speak for themselves'. But these are rarer than often thought. Many questions, especially questions of moment, demand some theoretical, conceptual, comparative import. Historians?and others?who reject any such approach (either tacitly or, in the case of Richard Cobb, with a certain aggressive panache)1 do them? selves a double disservice: (a) they rule out a wide and legitimate range of historical inquiry and (b) they fool themselves, in that the vaunted absence of 'imposed', 'alien' theories/concepts/comparisons opens the door to obscurity, arbitrariness and camouflaged 'common-sense' usages. Some historians of the Mexican Revolution go this way. Others, to their credit, introduce general theories and concepts; but too often they do so in dubious fashion. A common, sad spectacle is that of the narrative historian who, striking out from the shallows of empirical history (usually in a brief preface or conclusion) clutches instinctively at a Marxist life-belt which, entirely inadequate for the purpose, promptly deflates, leaving the victim to flounder. In his recent The Great Rebellion, which appears?with no apologies to Clarendon?in yet another 'Revolutions in the Modern World' series, Ramon Ruiz asserts that Mexico did not experience a revolution but a 'great rebellion'. This striking argument (what did the series editor make of it?) derives from Ruiz's model of a twentieth-century revolution, which?as in Russia, China or Cuba?must achieve 'a transformation of the basic structure of society', radically changing 'class structures as well as the patterns of wealth and income distribution', and further 'modify(ing) the nature ofa nation's economic depen? dency on the outside world'.2 1917 thus provides the yardstick and, compared with the Bolsheviks, Mexico's 'revolutionaries' are a poor lot?mere 'rebels': 'measured by the standards of Lenin and his disciples... (Zapata) fails woefully short of being a revolutionary'.3 We should note, for future reference, that</page><page sequence="2">2 BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH Ruiz readily accords the French Revolution 'revolutionary' status; and he recognises some vague kinship between the French and Mexican Revolutions? in that the latter 'harks back' to the former. But whereas in France the Revolu? tion 'upended the Ancient Regime and replaced it with a capitalist state run by the bourgeoisie', Mexico experienced no such dramatic transformation; at best it was a rebellion, or a form of 'bourgeois protest', which could only 'stream- line and update' a pre-existing capitalism.4 By 1910 the only proper revolution ?deserving of the name?was a socialist revolution. The agenda of history? the passage of Vorld time', to use a fashionable term?made this inevitable.5 Ruiz's life-belt thus deflates, taking him to the bottom. Others hang on tight and can be seen threshing in the water for some time. James Cockcroft, for example, is convinced of the capitalist nature of Porfirian society, and is thus warmly receptive of Frank's general theorisation of the pervasiveness of capitalism in Latin America since the Conquest.6 Cockcroft's definition of capitalism, like Frank's, stresses relations of exchange rather than production; conversely, he views feudalism as a form of *closed economy', in a manner radically different from Kula or Banaji.7 But, if the market and money economy are paramount, Cockcroft also notes that their growth is accompanied by a 'corresponding development of wage labor', which he asserts as an empirical fact of Porfirian society: 80% ofthe labour forces were agricultural proletarians.8 Thus, the Mexican economy was undeniably capitalist before, during, and after the Revolution. What, therefore, did the Revolution achieve? It did 'little more than overthrow Porfirio Diaz and change part of the ideology of social change'.9 There were no 'radical changes in the class structure and in the power relationships between classes'. Nevertheless, the Revolution was the product of class conflict?of 'explosive confrontation between proletarians and capital- ists'. It was, in effect, a failed proletarian/socialist revolution, which challenged, but could not defeat, an established bourgeois order, and which has left a legacy of 'intense class conflict'. The task of the (radical) historian is therefore to stress the role of the Precursor Movement (especially the P.L.M.) and to assimilate them to an unbroken tradition of revolutionary protest stretching from Flores Magon through Zapata and the 1930s Sindicato de Petroleros down to Lucio Cabanas. Adolfo Gilly's thesis of the revolucion interrumpida is sub- stantially similar.10 Although this interpretation has the merit of stressing the central role of popular forces?and of seeing them act in autonomous fashion, not as the 'inert material moulded by the will of a few leaders'?it is rarely critical and too often romantic in its depiction of these forces.11 Major differ? ences and antagonisms are blurred, as groups are lumped together under the revolutionary rubric; the roles of historical actors, like the P.L.M., and historical forces, like 'anti-imperialism', are grossly exaggerated; hence it is possible to read off a reconstituted historical script in order to make contemporary points.12 Above all, this interpretation has to stress the failed?or 'interrupted'? character of the revolution. The revolution is important not for what it did, but for what it did not do (it did not establish socialism); or, for what, at some future time, after a long 'interruption', it might yet do. Ruiz, Cockcroft and Gilly all reject the notion of 1910 as a bourgeois revolu? tion (Gilly emphatically repudiates this as a 'petty bourgeois, centrist-socialist' heresy).13 Ruiz and Cockcroft do so (a) because they conceive ofthe old regime</page><page sequence="3">THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION 3 as capitalist anyway; and (b) because they adhere to a demanding, simplistic, but common notion of 'revolution'. For them, as for Theda Skocpol in her recent, rather over-rated comparative study, revolutions are 'rapid, basic trans- formations of a society's state and class structures, accompanied and in part carried out by class-based revolt from below'; to qualify for this select group (for, as Skocpol acknowledges, these are 'relatively rare occurrences in modern world history'), a would-be revolution must involve 'successful socio-political transformation?actual change of state and class structures' (her italics).14 Ruiz and Cockcroft are, indeed, even more demanding (for this reason, Skocpol is prepared to concede the Mexican Revolution revolutionary status; we shall see why in a moment). For them, there can only be 'bourgeois' and 'socialist' revolutions, and the former is ruled out on both empirical and theoretical grounds. Implicit in their 'theory' is a mistaken notion of what a 'bourgeois' revolution looks like. Ruiz, we have noted, accepts 1789 as a bourgeois revolu? tion. But historians no longer believe that 1789 (that is, the process of change initiated in 1789 and continued to, say, 1815) destroyed 'feudalism' and in? stalled 'capitalism'. In respect of social and property relations, the French Revolution neither expropriated entire classes, nor subverted the pattern of pre-1789 landownership; 'the transfer of property brought about by the Revolu? tion was ... far less radical than that effected by social upheavals ofthe present century'.15 Nor does it appear that nineteenth-century French peasants?the supposed beneficiaries of revolutionary change?were dramatically better off than their fathers and grandfathers.16 The parallel with Mexico, evident in these conclusions, is reinforced if political changes are included, and Tocque- ville's acute analysis is borne in mind: 'the Revolution had . . . two distinct phases: one in which the sole aim . . . seemed to be to make a clean sweep of the past; and a second in which attempts were made to salvage fragments from the wreckage of the old order'; as a result of which there emerged 'a govern? ment both stronger and far more autocratic than the one which the Revolution had overthrown'.17 Ruiz is hardly consistent, therefore, in according the French Revolution the 'revolutionary' status which he denies the Mexican. More generally, it is unhistorical and theoretically stultifying to expect the Mexican?or any other revolution, especially a Tocquevillean', bourgeois revolution?to accomplish sweeping changes in social relations (or, more specifically, the relations of pro? duction) in a relatively short time, by violent, political measures. Even Leninist, socialist revolutions are processes rather than discrete events (that is, they are processes initiated and punctuated by salient events; the Chinese Revolution is, in this respect, an even better example than the Russian). And bourgeois revolu? tions are, in comparison, dilatory affairs. Thus Enrique Semo's image of succes- sive waves of bourgeois revolution?1810, 1854, 1910?is more convincing, realistic and historically faithful.18 Here, the revolution in the relations of pro? duction is a matter for the longue duree, but it is punctuated and decisively accelerated by political events and social conflicts. The parallel with France? 1789, 1830,1848?is apparent.19 Historians should not be looking for the single, knock-out, revolutionary punch, but for the accumulated blows which dispatch the old social order; they should evaluate their individual percussive effect, and their sequential relationship. This, in the space permitted, I shall try to do.</page><page sequence="4">4 BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH Any such exercise, however, runs a risk which a good many recent Marxist/ marxisant analyses?not just those of the Mexican Revolution?have incurred; a descent into some sort of Marxist functionalism.20 Aware of the complexities of the historical record, and rightly dismissive of a crude, instantaneous transi? tion from 'feudal' to 'bourgeois', some writers have ingeniously multiplied their explanatory concepts, producing grotesque hybrids like Manuel Aguilar Mora's feudocapitalista Porfiriato.21 Juan Felipe Leal has constructed an entire func- tionalist chronology of the ancien regime: creation of a capitalist state (ca. 1854); hegemony of the liberal-landlord fraction, under a parliamentary form (1867-76); hegemonic crisis (1876-80); 1880, recomposition of the power bloc, hegemony ofthe imperialist fraction ofthe bourgeoisie, executive dictator? ship; 1890, irruption ofthe Mexican industrial bourgeoisie, 'transformation and diversification of the landlords', and 'new components of the power bloc'; 1908, 'expulsion of a sector of landlords from the power bloc'.22 Not only is much of this open to empirical question?above all, on the grounds of seeing rupture where there is continuity, and of making quite misleading political attributions, e.g. the supposed 'parliamentary' form of 1867-76;23 it is also theoretically dubious, in that it appropriates conventional?often very con- ventional?'bourgeois' political history and then invests it with supposed class content and significance. Administrations are mechanically reduced to classes or class fractions; shifts in the -superstructure are attributed to profound seismic motions below. Though there may be precedents for such analysis among the classics of Marxism, e.g. Marx's The Class Struggles in France 1848 to 1850, these are not the weightiest of theoretical authorities. Nevertheless, this approach?whereby class attributions are read off from conventional political narrative?is all too common; as, for example, the work and influence of Nicos Poulantzas suggest. 'In place of theories based on the analysis of accumula? tion and class struggle', it has been pointed out, exponents of this approach 'utilize the political concepts of Poulantzas?'power bloc', 'hegemony', 'govern? ing class', etc.?like pigeon-holes which can be filled with the relevant concepts from a political analysis of the class structure of any given state'.24 Similar analyses of the Revolution, in which political factions, like Villismo and Carrancismo, are reduced to classes or class fractions, usually on the basis of ideological obiter dicta and/or a narrow prosopography, are also familiar; I have offered criticisms of this approach elsewhere.25 Two particular variants of this 'class fraction' interpretation of the Revolu? tion deserve closer attention. First, there is the fashion for Bonapartist explana- tions (which, again, display the influence of Poulantzas and his school).26 According to this analysis, the Revolution established a Bonapartist regime in which a stalemate of class forces enabled the revolutionary leadership? the 'revolutionary caudillismo' of the Sonorans?to assume political control, relatively autonomous of class forces (though, ultimately, in the interests of the bourgeoisie).27 Again, there are major problems, theoretical and empirical. Marx's original formulation of Bonapartism is itself confusing. The bourgeoisie, ruling 'absolutely' one moment, then surrender power to Louis Napoleon, and 'all classes, equally impotent and equally mute, fail on their knees before the rifle butt'; the state is not just 'relatively autonomous' but, it seems 'com? pletely independent'.28 Yet, at the same time, 'the state power is not suspended</page><page sequence="5">THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION 5 in midair. Bonaparte represents a class ... the small-holding peasants'.29 Pre? viously, we should note, it is the lumpenproletariat?the 'scum, offal (and) refuse of all classes'?which constitute the only class upon which he can base himself unconditionally'.30 And, in power, Bonaparte 'is forced to create an artificial caste', viz., the bureaucracy, which, standing 'alongside the actual classes of society', underpins his regime.31 Finally?as proponents of the theory stress?Bonapartism ultimately sustains bourgeois capitalism; Bonaparte 'feels it to be his mission tosafeguard "bourgeois order" \32 Rumbustious and polemical, replete with paradox and epigram, Marx's Eighteenth Brumaire is hardly a piece of rigorous theorising. Yet it has formed the basis for an entire landscape of theoretical constructs: Bonapartism, Caesarism, the 'exceptionaF and 'relatively autonomous' capitalist state, interpretations of fascism in Europe and populism in Latin America (for some, populism and Bonapartism are almost interchange- able).33 It is not surprising, granted the shaky theoretical foundations, that these constructs are wobbly. And, compounding the irresponsibility of their architects, they open their doors to all and sundry. So many regimes are admitted to the Caesarist/Bonapartist salon that their very 'exceptionality' (which constitutes their theoretical raison d'etre) begins to look dubious: relatively autonomous states are ten-a-penny. Admission is easy, because criteria for membership are loose. Populism, it has been convincingly argued, offers a poor organising concept for understanding Latin American historical development.34 And, in the specific case of Mexico, Bonapartism exercises an appeal by virtue of its very ideological flaccidity. Yet there are strong empirical objections: no 'enormous bureaucacy, well-gallooned and well-fed' governed Mexico in the 1920s; nor, I shall argue, was the Sonoran state the 'enormous bureaucratic and military organisation' which (according to theory) maintained Bonapartist rule in France, and con- ferred on the state its decisive relative autonomy.35 Putting it simply, the Mexican state of the 1920s was too weak to rise above classes in Bonapartist fashion; and the fact that it was not the agent of a single, hegemonic class indicated less its relative autonomy than its role as the object and victim of class conflict. Ergo, classes were not 'impotent . . . and mute before the rifle butt', but, rather, active and vocal in trying to get the rifle butt on their sides. Maybe this was an 'exceptionaF situation, but it endured, I would suggest, until the late 1940s, when the battle for state power was won and lost, and the state assumed its 'normal' role, in which 'relative autonomy' was (to degrees that might be debated) weak or non-existent. Linked to this interpretation is the common notion of a major shift? accomplished by the Revolution?from the hegemony of the comprador to that of the national bourgeoisie. The Revolution might not have dismounted feudalism, but it wrenched power from one class fraction and bestowed it on another, whose 'project' radically differed in respect of economic policy and attitudes to foreign trade and investment. However, as eminent proponents of this interpretation have to admit, the newly ensconced national bourgeoisie displayed a strange ambivalence and hardly delivered the goods: during the 1920s foreign trade and investment grew, dependence on the U.S. increased.36 What for them is a puzzle and/or a betrayal is, in fact, quite unproblematic and consistent if (a) the project ofthe revolutionary regime is seen as essentially</page><page sequence="6">6 BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH moderate, pragmatic, and evolutionary and (b) its pedigree is traced back to the Porfiriato, rather than to some mythical genesis in the heat of the popular revolution. The revolutionaries failed?indeed, hardly attempted?to break Mexican 'dependence' because they never had any intention of doing so. Like their Cientifico predecessors (I refer to the Cientificos of the 1900s) they sought only to renegotiate Mexico's relations with foreign capital, consonant with the changes wrought by a generation of Porfirian growth. Given their statements and policies during 1910-20, and the relative absence of any deep, popular xenophobia (directed against foreign capitalism; Spanish and Chinese immigrants were a different matter), this outcome was entirely predictable. The Revolution was not, in this sense, a nationalist revolution, nor even a nationalist revolution betrayed. So far, the argument has been negative: the demotion of the Revolution to a mere?however 'great'?rebellion is theoretically stultifying; the promiscuous fathering of class fractions warrants a snip from Occam's razor. Neither Bonapartism nor the revolution of the national bourgeoisie are convincing hypotheses. What positive alternative(s) may be offered by way of a general conceptualization of the Revolution, its character and results? Amidlhe numer? ous studies of 'revolution' now available (most of which I shall pass over) two different kinds of definition seem to hold sway: what I shall call the descriptive and the functional. Furthermore, arguments about what constitutes a 'real' revolution sometimes hinge upon (unacknowledged) allegiance to these defini- tions. A descriptive definition says what a revolution looks like: it usually embraces major violence, political?maybe class?conflict of a serious kind, and attendant social upheaval. Revolution is here distinguished from minor rebellion or cuartelazo?a useful, conventional and old distinction, epitomised by Louix XVPs famous exchange with the Due de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt.37 In the same vein, historians of the Mexican Revolution have carefully and rightly distinguished between the Revolution and revolutions, i.e. individual coups and minor revolts.38 But a 'revolutionary' mountain may strain to bring forth a post-revolutionary mouse: historical outcomes do not stand in direct proportion to the violence and casualties which make them possible. In the case of France, for example, 'there is. .. some apparent justification for regard- ing the Revolution as a largely ephemeral phenomenon whose relative violence, in an age accustomed to greater stability than our own, led to its being credited with more lasting significance than was actually the case'.39 By the same token, there are 'failed' revolutions, like Taiping or 1905; descriptively revolutionary, functionally ineffective, except inasmuch as they (perhaps) laid the groundwork for later, successful revolutions. To go further: a valid descriptive definition should, I would argue, contain three key elements which inter-relate; which distinguish revolution (failed or successful) from coup or rebellion (again, failed or successful); and which thus preserves the specificity of 'great revolu? tions'.40 These elements are: (i) genuine mass participation, (ii) the struggle of rival visions/ideologies (which may or may not be class-based: I would not wish to exclude multi-class movements of, say, nationalist or religious per- suasion: English Puritanism, the Risorgimento, anti-colonial nationalist move? ments), and (iii) a consequent, serious battle over political authority. These three elements go together. A revolution involves genuine mass</page><page sequence="7">THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION 7 participation (though, necessarily, only a minority of the masses is directly involved). Participation is 'genuine' in that the masses are not mere cannon- fodder; there is a significant degree of autonomous, voluntary mobilisation. In Trotsky's celebrated formulation: 'the history of a revolution is for us first of all a history of the forcible entrance of the masses into the realm of ruler- ship over their own destiny'.41 Needless to say this state of affairs is relatively rare and usually short-lived?as it was in Mexico where, many now suggest, it never happened at all. While it endures, however, mass mobilisation requires a set of commitments: religious, millenarian, nationalist, regional, personalist, or class-based. These popular appeals may?in the eyes of ex post facto critics ?seem nai've, delusory, even indicative of a lamentable false consciousness: take the case of the 'non-revolutionary' peasants of Oaxaca who followed their serrano caciques to battle after 1910 as they had back in the 1870s; who entertained no far-reaching, i.e. functionally revolutionary, aims, but who performed a descriptively revolutionary role, in that they participated in direct, effective fashion in the Revolution, serving what they saw as their own interests, not acting as the dragooned victims of the levcu*1 These participants have been termed 'non-revolutionary' since they espoused backward-looking, 'conserva? tive', hence 'non-revolutionary' objectives?which , in itself, is broadly true and valid. But if, displaying what Thompson has called the 'enormous condescension of posterity', we set up such a single, functional criterion, and then proceed to segregate 'revolutionary' sheep from 'non-revolutionary' goats, we risk impos- ing an arbitrary division which greatly prejudices historical understanding.43 For backward-looking, 'conservative' (in the Tillys' vocabulary 'reactive')44 popular movements have played a major part in revolutions: as authorities as diverse as Lawrence Stone and Karl Marx have attested:45 just when (the living) seem engaged in revolutionising themselves and things, in creating something that has never existed, precisely in such periods of revolutionary crisis they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service and borrow from them names, battle cries and costumes, in order to present the new scene of world history in this time- honoured disguise and this borrowed language. Indeed, a strict interpretation of this rule would require us to discard Zapatismo and a host of lesser popular movements which, during 1910-15, challenged the status quo and revolutionised the country, but on the basis of largely backward- looking, prescriptive norms and symbols. This raises the second criterion of 'revolutionary' status, which may be invoked to the detriment of traditional movements like Zapatismo. Revolu? tions are?rightly?judged on what they achieve as well as what they look like. Here, 1905 and 1917 stand poles apart. There are numerous formulations of what a revolution must achieve functionally to qualify as a revolution, though many are variations on the same theme(s). Skocpol, we have noted, combines a functional requirement (a 'rapid, basic transformation of a society's state and class structure') with a descriptive rider ('accompanied and in part carried out by class-based revolt from below'). 'A revolution', Huntington states, 'is a rapid, fundamental, and violent change in the dominant values and myths ofa society, in its political insitutions, social structure, leadership and government activity</page><page sequence="8">8 BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH and politics'.46 Historians of the Mexican Revolution, like Ruiz, advance func? tional criteria so demanding that the Revolution becomes a rebellion (a demo- tion which other 'great' revolutions?certainly those of 'bourgeois' character ?would suffer if similarly inspected) and a whole host of revolutionary partici- pants are, in effect, denied 'revolutionary' status. Meanwhile other historians ?like Cockcroft?accord 'revolutonary' status by virtue of assimilating partici- pants to a preferred norm, that of the militant, proletarian, anti-capitalist P.L.M.47 Yet pre-eminent rebel movements, like Zapatismo, cannot be so assimi- lated: they were neither proletarian nor socialist; and, especially in their early years, they entertained no grand project for the future transformation of Mexico.48 No more?to take another example?did the Cedillos set out to build Jerusalem in the green and pleasant Valle del Maiz. Talk of 'communism' notwithstanding, the Cedillos envisaged?and Saturnino Cedillo later imple- mented?a local, rural, personalist and restorative solution to their grievances.49 Zapata and the Cedillos (and many like them) were, in a sense, reformists who could only implement their desire reforms by revolutionary guerrilla war; and the vision which impelled them (for visions, myths and moral imperatives were crucial) was drawn from the past, perhaps suitably gilded. Arnaldo Cordova, who understands this well enough, is logical and consistent in setting it against his own (functional) definition of revolution:50 can we legitimately speak of a revolution in the case of the Zapatista movement? Much of what we now know about Zapata and Zapatismo ... suggests no. That return to the past on which the movement's localism was founded, the lack of both a national project of development and a conception of the State, are elements which prevent our conceiving it as a revolution. A revolution, social or political, is never local, never looks to restore the past; a revolution is national and for that very reason the seizure of political power figures as its prime objective. Following Stone and Marx, I would dissent. And I would do so, first, on the common-sense, semantic grounds that to deny the 'revolutionary' character of Zapatismo and most popular movements of the Mexican Revolution (sic) is pedantic and misleading; and second, because it involves the a priori segregation of rebel/revolutionary movements on the basis ofa single, imposed and exagger- ated criterion: that of ideological position. It therefore exalts ideology?on which the fundamental progressive/backward-looking, 'proactive/reactive' distinction is based. By the same token, it neglects active commitment and efficacy, not least in terms of class struggle. The Zapatistas may have lacked the ideological sophistication of the Flores Magon; but they did vastly more to rend the old order and attempt the creation of something radically different. And that radically different something, though it was not socialism, did present a stark contrast to the Porfirian status quo ante. Zapatismo, and many lesser movements of similar type, fought for the implementation of an alternative vision, which could elicit fierce popular allegiance (so, too, did certain serrano groups). If the vision was nostalgic, the action was revolutionary?often class- consciously revolutionary. And it is not unknown for nostalgic, 'traditional' visions to be transmuted?especially in the heat of revolution?into more forward-looking, radical ideologies: thus the millenial traditions of the Russian</page><page sequence="9">THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION 9 and Chinese peasantries (evidenced in the raskolniki and Taiping rebels) fed into the revolutionary movements of the twentieth century; while in Mexico the inarticulate, localised rebellions of 1910-15 often paved the way to better organised, more sophisticated protest later, especially in the 1930s.51 This brings me to the third, final, and briefest element in my descriptive definition? which is also raised by the poncluding sentence of Cordova, quoted above. It may be true that popular movements, like Zapatismo, were reluctant to seize state power?and that this proved a fatal weakness. But their mobilisation of the rural masses behind a genuinely popular programme involved a major confrontation with the state, and significantly helped in the dissolution of the state (which, as Lorenzo Meyer points out, had effectively ceased to exist by 1914).52 They thus contributed to the creation?if not the resolution?of a situation which has been seen (by proponents of what Skocpol calls the 'political-conflict' approach) as distinctively revolutionary: that is, the com? petition for political power between rival forces, leading to 'multiple sovereignty' ?i.e. the breakdown ofthe state.53 Of this Mexico was a classic example. I would therefore, justify the use of 'revolutionary' to describe broadly- based popular movements, possessed of powerful, rival visions, locked in a sustained struggle (political, military, ideological), in a situation of multiple sovereignty. Irrespective of outcome and function, the Mexican Revolution clearly fits these descriptive criteria; common usage is therefore valid. But before moving on to the second, more contentious question of function, it will be necessary to flesh out the skeletal description already presented. I have elsewhere suggested that the Mexican Revolution may be best analysed in terms not of two contenders (old regime and revolution) but four: old regime (Porfirismo and Huertismo); reformist liberals (chiefly, though not exclusively urban middle class); popular movements (subdivided into agraristas and serranos); and the ultimate national synthesis, Carrancismo/Constitutionalism, which mutates, without significant genetic innovation, into the governing coalition of the 1920s.54 It will at once be noted that these are not homologous categories, e.g. regimes, classes, ideologies. They are, rather, historical actors, representing clusters of interests, in which class is crucial, but other allegiances ?ideological, regional, clientelist?also compete; they are useful at this very general level of analysis but, of course, must be broken down for many other analytical purposes. Class may be seen as central to some of these basic divisions, e.g. nationally, between the old regime and the popular movement, locally in specific cases such as Morelos, the Laguna, the Yaqui Valley, the Huasteca. Other divisions, such as that between Villismo (a hypertrophied section of the popular movement) and Carrancismo (a category in its own right), cannot be reduced to class interests, not even 'in the last analysis'. No more can the Cristiada ofthe 1920s. The denial of a neat congruence between political factions and class interests does not, according to my definition, detract from the revolutionary character of the process initiated in 1910. Here, it is the strength and autonomy of popular movements which count. Recent, revisionist accounts, which deny this feature of the revolution, are, I believe, basically mistaken and sometimes at odds with the evidence they themselves produce. Some deny or seriously qualify the importance of peasant rebellion, stressing instead peasant passivity; some</page><page sequence="10">10 BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH emphasise instead the revolutionary role of the middle classes, the well-to-do, or the now popular rancheros (rancheros and peasants being neatly, but rather misleadingly, segregated, not least by the shibboleth of 'communalism').55 There is often, too, an underlying implication that to qualify as a 'revolutionary' class the peasantry must display a level of revolutionary commitment?in terms of sustained, majority activity, broad geographical support, class con? sciousness and political sophistication?which few classes (bourgeois, pro? letarian or peasant) have ever attained. Of course, if the fences are built too high, the peasant nag will fail at the first. In this respect, the old, 'populist' historians (such as Tannenbaum), and?for all their faults?the new Marxists (Cockcroft, Gilly, Semo) at least grasp that the revolution was, as its participants knew well enough, a mass, popular movement, pitting against each other hostile groups, classes and ideologies, and revealing, in dramatic fashion, the bankruptcy ofthe old regime. The character of the revolution?popular, ideological, profound?had obvious implications for its outcome; definition and function therefore overlap. A dismissal or de-emphasis of the revolution's profound, popular character is likely to encourage a view of its outcome which stresses continuity over change. But discussion of the revolution's outcome is notoriously difficult, and any attempt must be prefaced by some preliminary clarification. We may try to stop the clock and ask 'what has changed?'; but we must be careful to relate change to the revolution, i.e. not to fail into the old error of post hoc ergo propter hoc, whereby all post-revolutionary developments are attributed to the revolution, even those which were immanent in pre-1910 Mexico; and we must decide at which point to stop the clock?1917,1920, 1923, 1929,1934, 1940, 1985? The later the date, the greater the risk of smuggling in 'revolu? tionary' changes which are not primarily of revolutionary origin (for example, the economic nationalism of the 1930s, which must be seen in a global as well as post-revolutionary, national context).56 Yet, if Semo's approach is right (and I believe it is) it would be wrong to stop in, say, 1920?important though that conjuncture was in the crystallisation of the post-revolutionary regime. By the same token, it would be wrong to close a general analysis of the French Revolution with Thermidor, or even the Restoration (note the last sentence of this essay). We face, therefore, a familiar problem: how to slice up the seam- less garment of history. But the problem is especially acute when?like Joseph's coat of many colours?the garment is rich, variegated, and the object of bitter contention. 1920, for example, may afford a good vantage point to judge certain conjunctural political changes; but even 1985 may be too early to reach firm conclusions about the revolution's epochal significance. The optimal solution, I shall suggest, is a combination of long and short term perspectives: the latter focussing on the 1920s (the immediate outcome), the former on general consequences down to the present day. But analysis of general consequences is fraught with a particular difficulty which must be tackled at the outset. Discussion of post-revolutionary Mexican history is often confined within a teleological straightjacket. The revolution puts Mexico on fixed lines of development, hence all subsequent progress (I use the term neutrally) can be traced back to the revolution, to the orientation and impulse it conferred. Three principal teleologies are influential. First, there is the old</page><page sequence="11">THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION 11 revolutionary orthodoxy, which sees the revolution as a unique national experi? ence: Gesta Dei per Mexicanos. Thanks to the revolution, Mexico has proceeded ?and still proceeds?towards social justice, economic development and national integration. It is the stock-in-trade of PRI candidates on the stump. The historical implication is that all participants in the revolution (including those who fought and killed each other) made a contribution to this happy outcome. Powerful in the rhetoric of the regime, this teleology is less evident in serious historiography?though elements can be found.57 Two alternative teleologies represent radical critiques of this interpretation. One gives priority to the onward march of capitalism?to which the revolution and all 'revolutionary' regimes have contributed, official discourse notwithstand- ing. The revolution itself was a bourgeois revolution (at least in the weak sense that it was not socialist, and maybe involved the bourgeois defeat of peasant and proletarian forces; sometimes, too, in the strong sense that it also over- threw a feudal, or at least pre-capitalist, ancien regime', and/or that it repre? sented the conscious project of the national bourgeoisie). And subsequent regimes, Cardenas' included, have in their different ways furthered this capitalist development,58 According to this?what might be called the 'logic of capital' school?the state has served as an agent of capitalism, national and/or inter? national; it is, in the jargon of one debate, an 'instrumental' state.59 A third, influential, rival teleology also derives its key concept (the 'relatively auto? nomous' state) from grand theory. Here, the state?prior to and hence relatively autonomous of capital?becomes the chief motor of Mexican development, and the rise of the state dominates Mexican history (at least since the Revolu? tion) much as the ascendant middle class dominated the Whig interpretation of British history. When framed within a Marxist discourse, this view necessarily stresses the relativity of the state's autonomy, and thus often blends with the Bonapartist theory mentioned above. Non-Marxists, on the other hand, for whom the state's autonomy causes no theoretical discomfort, veer towards a kind of statolatry, which now pervades a good deal of recent historical studies.60 *When all is said and done', a recent, excellent monography con- cludes, 'all the complexities of the Mexican revolution can be reduced to this one dimension: the state'.61 Guillermo de la Pena, in his anthropological study of the Morelos highlands, takes a wider perspective: 'the theme of the State', he announces at the outset, 'runs throughout the whole book', and, further- more, stretches back far into the colonial period; the state?or, rather, its 'power domain'?constitutes 'the external power which has defined com? munal goals; from colonial tributes and labour control, to land distribution and contemporary tax collection'; the 'historical force of the State' can be seen 'pervading economics and politics, religion and kinship, ethnicity and class'.62 No-one, of course, doubts the importance of the state?any more than the importance of class. like so many historical questions this is one of degree, though degree which cannot easily be quantified. Putting the question simply, it may be asked: should the rise of the post-revolutionary state be seen as the crucial, formative development in modern Mexican history? Is the state, in other words, the key organising concept for the understanding of that history? It is my contention that those who have veered towards statolatry have gone</page><page sequence="12">12 BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH too far, and that to exchange class reductionism for statolatry is no gain; indeed, it is probably a loss. There are three main objections to this, the most fashion- able of the three teleologies. First, it imparts a kind of Whiggish unilinearity to modern Mexican history, in that all major developments, in all periods, are hooked up to this basic engine of change. And the engine keeps going, in pretty much the same direction: that is, towards centralisation, corporatism and bureaucracy. Secondly, this view empirically exaggerates the power and role of the state, especially for the earlier period (roughly, pre-1940). Its proponents read back the modern Mexican state?with its developed bureaucracy and corporate structures, massive budget, pervasive economic presence and sheer longevity?into an age when it did not exist; when today's Leviathan was yesterday's minnow. Nor was the generation of Leviathan necessarily foreseen. We should not overlook?as Maitland reminded us?that things now securely lodged in the past were once part of an unknown future. The Sonoran state of the 1920s was precarious, its authority challenged by caudillo and Catholic Church, its survival predicated on Washington's favour, its character, according to James Wilkie, still basically 'passive'.63 Even the Cardenas presidency?rightly seen as a key period in the development of the modern state?began with a major schism within the state apparatus and ended with the traumatic election of 1940, when the outgoing President, opting for a irriddle-of-the-road, safety-first successor, had to reckon with a strenuous opposition, a majority vote against the official candidate, and a legacy of political bitterness and disquiet. 1940 revealed the limitations, as well as the strengths, of the maturing revolutionary state (and, indeed, had Cardenas opted for Mugica rather than Avila Camacho, i.e. for his preferred candidate rather than for the safe candidate, these limitations might have been more drastically revealed). Third, following from this, statolatry conceives of the state in anthropo- morphic terms: it is a discrete entity, like an individual which acts upon others (more than it is acted upon), which possesses aims, interests, and fast burgeoning powers. This is not the liberal, pluralist state (the neutral arena where interests clash and are resolved); nor is it the classic, Marxist, 'instrumental' state, serving class interests?for these interests are rarely specified; rather it is an indepen? dent, i.e. very relatively or even absolutely autonomous, actor, a historical prime mover which cannot be disaggregated, behind which nothing or no-one can be discerned. The interest groups of pluralist theory, Marxist social classes, do not impinge; or, if they do, it is as supplicants and recipients ofthe state's favour, or as victims of its wrath. In extreme versions this anthropomorphic state indeed assumes human form andit is supposed that the destiny of Mexico is done and undone in Los Pinos and in the government departments and that the people are no more than the raw material with which the ruler?wise or not?shapes the history ofthe nation'.64 Statolaters misconceive the role of the Mexican state. Prior to 1940 (to take a rough dividing line) the state was weaker, often much weaker than they suppose; after 1940 it was much less autonomous. Indeed, it would be difficult to find a state in Latin America which, over the past forty years, has so con? sistently and successfully framed policies favourable to capital accumulation, and the socio-political foundations which underpin it (this is a point I will</page><page sequence="13">THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION 13 return to in conclusion). All three teleologies, therefore, must be rejected. There are no grounds for homogenizing the entire post-revolutionary period. The revolution did not set the country on a fixed and immutable course. Rather, in the short term (taking a vantage point in the 1920s), the revolution effected certain important changes, some of which could not be undone. Furthermore, in the longer term, the revolution made possible certain later developments, while closing off others. It created, in other words, windows of opportunity; though whether these opportunities would be seized would depend on later events, themselves the product of social and political conflicts. The first task, therefore, is to specify what had changed, irrevocably and significantly, by the 1920s; then to consider how subsequent options?in the fields of agrarian reform, state-building, economic nationalism?were proffered, taken, or refused.65 As of the 1920s, two kinds of change were evident. At the formal level? the level of laws, decrees, official policies and constitutional provisions?the degree of real change can easily be exaggerated. True, the new Constitution promised fine things, 'predating the Soviet . . . constitution'; and the new regime was suffused with populist rhetoric.66 But, as so often in the past, rhetoric and reality diverged. As in the 1860s and 70s, the victorious revolu- tionaries inherited a prostrate country and a chaotic government; they there? fore placed strong government and economic reconstruction (a recurrent phrase in the post-1917 period, as it had been exactly fifty years before) above con- situtional fidelity and promised reforms.67 The Maderista promise of Sufragio Efectivo, No Re-eleccion was hardly honoured?still less if Womack's transla? tion, 'A Real Vote and No Boss Rule', is preferred.68 Elections were still fixed, bosses?like 'Don Melchor' of Paracho?still ruled, and the Sonoran version of re-eleccion was only averted by Toral's bullets.69 No more did the realities of labour politics?typified by Morones and the CROM?faithfully reflect Article 123. In the agrarian sector, reform came: between 1915 and 1928 5.3m hectares were distributed to over half a million recipients in some 1500 communities.70 Though, by 1930, ejidal property constituted only 6.3% of national agricultural property (by area) or 9.4% (by value), there were states where the respective percentages were much higher (Morelos: 59 and 62; Yucatan: 30 and 15; the Federal District: 25 and 13; Tlaxcala: 19 and 21). Particularly in the states of the central plateau, therefore, the agrarian reform had substantially modified Porfirian property-owning and power relations even before the sweeping Cardenista reforms. Forthright assertions of agrarian continuismo need to be qualified.71 However, the practical consequences of this limited but significant formal reform depended a good deal on the informal context within which it was enacted, and to which I shall turn in a moment. Taken on their own, the figures of formal reform (whose accuracy may be questioned)72 tell only part of the story. Of the remaining 'revolutionary' policies, the role of economic nationalism, I have already suggested, is easily exaggerated. Apart from recurrent squabbles with the oil companies (in the 1920s, as in the 1930s, oil was something of a special case) the Sonorans showed no disposition to squeeze foreign invest? ment, or radically to change Mexico's economic relations with the capitalist 'core'. Rather, for much ofthe 1920s, the greatest governmental commitment</page><page sequence="14">14 BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH to reform?in rhetorical and practical terms?was to be found in its anti- clericalism, and its related espousal of state education. These twin issues bulked large (much larger than other 'socio-economic' issues) at the Constitutional Congress of 1916-17; they dominated the politics of the subsequent decade, especially after 1926; they were still dominant as the maximato drew to a close.73 In the short term (in, say, the twenty years following the fail of Huerta) the chief legacy of the revolution in the realm of formal governmental policy was therefore a virulent anti-clericalism, linked to an ideology of aggressive state-building. This substantiates, rather than contradicts, my earlier point: Sonoran etalisme derived precisely from an awareness of the weakness of the state, its lack of institutional and ideological support (of, perhaps, ideological hegemony). Policies of state-building are themselves poor evidence of the strength of the state. Furthermore, it is arguable that the Sonoran response? anti-clericalism?compounded the problem as much as it solved it. Thus we are asked to believe that Leviathan governed in a country where 'poverty, anarchy and violence reigned' and which, from 1928 to 1935, 'lived in a state of permanent political crisis'.74 Formal policies, then, displayed an indifference to 'Maderista' concerns for representative government (hence Vasconcelos' 1929 'crusade');75 and a greater commitment to an unpopular Jacobinism than to labour or agrarian reform But formal policies were not the whole picture. Indeed, my argument for a (relatively) weak state, acted upon more than it acts, requires that other factors be given due prominence: that is, informal (unofficial) forces and trends which occurred without governmental fiat; often, in fact, without anyone's (conscious) fiat. The revolution?in other, paradoxical, words?had a 'Burkean' as well as a Jacobin face. These informal, unofficial, 'Burkean' changes may for analytical purposes be divided into political and economic (though, in practice, they constantly intertwined, as we shall note). Politically, the revolu? tion destroyed much of the old order. After 1914-15, it is true, this obeyed conscious policy, as the Constitutionalists?and successors like Carrillo Puerto in Yucatan?systematically purged their enemies.76 But these official purges followed years of unscripted, popular retribution. During 1910-15 the national cacique, Diaz, and his Cientifico camarilla had been ousted; Porfirian governors had tumbled, along with many (not all) local caciques, especially north of the Isthmus; and with them went many of their well-to-do supporters. Huerta's counter-revolution (for that was what it was) stimulated a brief revival of these interests, which only made their subsequent downfall more certain.77 Some Porfirian families and officials survived, especially in regions, like los Altos de Jalisco, which were relatively quiet, or like Chiapas, where the mapache rebels had the strength to defy revolutionary incursions.78 But even survival required the acquisition of new political techniques, sometimes the deliberate colonisa- tion of the revolution (1920 was the annus mirabilis of entryism), and often the abandonment of political aspirations. The Terrazas family were allowed back to Mexico, but as businessmen, not politicos.19 The Chiapas landlords clung to power, political and economic, but (we shall note) in a radically changed environment. In short, the Porfirian political elite was eliminated as a distinct, coherent entity.80 It either disappeared, or adopted new, 'revolutionary' political mores,</page><page sequence="15">THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION 15 or swapped politics for business. As for the Federal army, it disappeared entirely: a rare event in Latin American military history. Those few Federals who sur? vived in uniform did so by virtue of an early, unusual commitment to the revolution.81 As an institution, the old Porfirian army vanished. Instead, a new, conglomerate army of revolutionary provenance now held sway: one which, though it soon acquired many of the military faults of its predecessor (these were at once evident in the campaigns against Villa, Zapata and others after 1915), nevertheless performed a different political role. Unlike Diaz's, the army of the revolution was highly political and fractious, and remained so until the 1930s (again, therefore, we note a major constraint on the power and independence of the national government). Furthermore, though the military often reached a modus vivendi with local vested interests?defending land? lords against agraristas, for example?it also contained pockets of abiding populism: in Morelos, where ex-Zapatistas ruled; in San Luis, where Cedillo's veterans underwrote his local power; with the armed agraristas who fought for Obregon in 1923; with Tejeda's armed peasant league.82 A relatively docile, professional army?Diaz's?gave way to a rumbustious, heterogeneous, politicised host, which would only gradually be tamed and slimmed down. And, though Amaro began the job, it was not until the 1940s that profession- alisation finally triumphed and military force was confined to its notional role as an ultima ratio.83 Indeed, in reviewing the revolution's demolition of the institutions of the old regime, it is ironic to note that it was the one which faced the most systematic attack (the Catholic Church) which survived with most vigour; an indication of the continued legitimacy of the Church, as com? pared to the caciques and generals of the Porfiriato, and of the inefficacy of revolutionary anti-clericalism. As old political landmarks were erased, new structures were erected, often piecemeal and unplanned. Despite their indifference to the principle of 'No Re-election' the Sonorans presided over a polity in which the circulation of elites was appreciably faster than in the past.84 Arguably, this brisker turnover was less the result of conscious policy than the inevitable consequence of the Hobbesian character of post-revolutionary politics. Now, in a context of mass mobilisation and recurrent military revolt?a *war of all against all'?and in the absence, as yet, of a controlling Leviathan state, the tenure of office was often nasty, brutish and short. Assassination claimed Zapata, Carranza, Villa, Obregon, Carrillo Puerto, Field Jurado, maybe Flores and Hill, as well as many lesser leaders; the attempted national revolutions of 1923, '27 and '29 were com- plemented by endemic local, political violence.85 A contributory factor to political instability was the genuine degree of mass mobilisation, evident in the embryonic parties, the unions, the peasant leagues. This was no decorous, democratic pluralism. Catholics fought with anti-clericals, agraristas with white guards; 'it is no exaggeration', one historian asserts, 'to talk of an open, con- tinuous?albeit generally local and disorganised?class war which covered great areas ofthe Mexican countryside (between 1920 and 1940)' .S6 Charrismo infected the unions and even dogged reformers?like Carrillo Puerto?were obliged to work through inappropriate caciquista systems in trying to implement their reforms.87 But this was not a throwback to the caciquismo ofthe Porfiriato. Patron-client links (which are the hallmarks of any caciquista or caudillista</page><page sequence="16">16 BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH system) are, to some extent, politicalry neutral; they may serve different ends, institutions and individuals. Now, unlike in the days of Diaz, they linked seg- ments of the population to mass associations, ckiming national status: the PNA, Partido Cooperativista, CROM, as well as their rivals, the Catholic unions, the LNDR, the ACJM.88 Undemocratic though these were, as regards both internal organisation and external functioning, they nevertheless transcended the narrow camarillas of the Porfiriato, and were unmistakeable legacies of the mass revolu? tion (as a comparative glance at, say, Brazil will confirm).89 And they gave post-revolutionary Mexico the character of?in Cordova's term?a sociedad de masas. Linked to this development was the populist rhetoric of the regime. By 'populist' I do not refer to a specific complex of class alliances (a complex whose character is much debated and may even be illusory).90 More simply, I mean the demotic, sometimes rabble-rousing rhetoric of the new revolutionary leaders, who presented themselves, as Obregon quintessentially did, as men of the people, for the people; frank, open, honest, sympathetic, even plebeian. Hence Obregon's campaign speeches and glad-handing; or Carrillo Puerto's deft use of popular symbols in Yucatan.91 Ultimately, official indigenismo would carry a similar message of populist empathy and national integration to the most marginal of Mexico's population. Of course, much of this was empty rhetoric. But even empty rhetoric has significance: the popular discourse ofthe revolution contrasted with the overtly elitist and racist rhetoric of the mature Porfiriato.92 This rhetorical shift can in turn be related to the change in popular mood ushered in by the 1910 revolution. Then, quite suddenly, the despised pelados of the Porfiriato had been transmuted into revolutionary guerrilleros ('we are no longer rag-dolls', as the insurgent campesinos of Papantla had pro- claimed, according to the ballad); the plebeians of Guadalajara invaded the Sunday evening paseo, turning it into some kind of Mexican charivari; those of Torreon travelled in the trams without paying and swaggered in the streets, forcing respectable citizens off the pavement into the mud ofthe gutter. It was, as one observer put it, rather like the Magnificat: 'the poor have been showered with goods and the rich have been left with nothing'.93 Like it or not, this factious plebs could no longer be ignored; it had to be reckoned with, con- ciliated, tamed. In defeat, Federico Gonzalez Garza mused on the history of the French Revolution, and the Villistas' failure to bind the masses to their cause by appropriate legislation; Salvador Alvarado set out to do precisely this with the Indians of Yucatan.94 Furthermore, however empty or cynical it became, the populist rhetoric which mass mobilisation had stimulated could in turn stimulate further mass mobilisation. For, given a constant reiteration of populist values and revolu? tionary objectives, the gulf between rhetoric and practice was strongly illumin- ated, and offered a standing invitation to those who would match practice to rhetoric. The Anti-Reelectionists of the 1920s attempted such a match in the field of electoral politics, but without success. With the onset of the depression and the renewed social conflict of the Maximato, however, attempts to bring reality into line with the reiterated social promises of revolutionary populism proved more efficacious. Cardenismo was not a revolutionary clone; but it carried the genes of the popular revolution within it and?as another brief,</page><page sequence="17">THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION 17 comparative glance at the rest of Latin America suggests?would have been unimaginable without the preceding political mobilisation of 1910-34. Cardenismo, as Hamilton rightly argues, was a different species of 'populism' from Vargismo or Peronismo.95 Indeed, one can go further: in many respects (ideological, emotional, generational) Cardenismo was the last kick of the old revolutionary cause before a new leadership, espousing a new project, took control ofthe country during the 1940s. The short-term, political consequences of the revolution, therefore, were profound: old institutions were shattered, mass organisations were born; elites circulated, rhetoric changed. All contributed, in the short-term (that is, until the thirties, if not the forties), to a weakening, not a strengthening, ofthe state, as compared with its Porfirian predecessor. The Sonorans, presiding over a heterogeneous, patchwork polity, were beholden to caciques, generals and Washington D.C. (Cardenas, too, confronted dissident governors, from Sonora to Chiapas; he was acutely aware of American pressure; his successor was elected amid dissent, violence and official corruption).96 If the revolutionary state out- stripped its Porfirian predecessor in potential strength, its actual authority was circumscribed and at times precarious (not least because, during the risky, transitional period of state-building, that very process incurred antagonism and resistance). The point at which potential was realised, the transition completed, and the risk surmounted, is open to debate; but I would put it in the 1940s, rather than the 1930s, still less the 1920s. The image of a Bonapartist state, kneading the dough of civil society, is inappropriate for pre-1940 Mexico. These political changes were profound, but were they, as sometimes sug? gested, the only significant changes to emerge from the Revolution?97 Was it indeed the case that economic structures?the relations of production? survived intact from Porfirian times? That, from the perspective of agrarian reform, for example, 'the Revolution had been practically useless' (prior to Cardenas)?98 And that only in the exceptional case of Morelos 'could it be said that the old structure of rural property had been palpably transformed'; hence, 'in the rest of the Mexican countryside the hacienda?that colonial hacienda which had consolidated itself in the nineteenth century?continued to be the dominant productive unit'?99 Structurally, as I have conceded, the hacienda remained powerful. Official agrarian reform had far from destroyed it. Yet even official agrarian reform had made significant inroads, not just in Morelos (and, I shall argue, even ostensibly modest inroads could undermine the rationale of hacienda production: that is, the hacienda did not have to be eliminated as a territorial unit before its basic viability was eroded). It is also worth stressing that the trend was towards hacienda dissolution. However gradual, this represented a 180? change in direc? tion after the sustained period of hacienda consolidation during the Porfiriato.100 Now, after 1910, the hacienda was cast as a main target;101 even if it survived territorially, for the moment, it was 'under siege'; in much of Tlaxcala (where, during the revolution, 'the hacienda system had temporarily ceased to exist'), landlords returned to face a new environment?'they had lost prestige . . . failed to regain the formerly secure backing of a state and federal government and experienced great difficulties in regaining their lands from the hands of more conscious and experienced peasant-leaders'.102 In distant Chiapas, too, where the</page><page sequence="18">18 BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH pro-landlord mapache administration took power in 1920, it faced a novel situation, in which 'the vast majority of the population, previously excluded from political participation, had been politicised'; hence, 'politics in Chiapas in the 1920s was vastly different from what it had been prior to the revolution'; and, I would argue, this ostensibly political development carried important consequences for the hacienda system, granted its economic rationale and character.103 Nor were these examples rare or exceptional: the experience of Rosalie Evans, engaged in her ultimately fatal struggle with local agraristas in Puebla, was replicated throughout the country during the 1920s and '30s, as regions of agrarian disaffection, even if temporarily quietened, renewed their acquaintance with the old conflicts ofthe revolution.104 The revolution thus reversed the Porfirian trend towards land concentra? tion and, no less important, set in motion a long process of agrarian mobilisa? tion. The power and legitimacy of the landlord class?which had underpinned Porfirian rule?never recovered. Terrazas?blaming 'Communist' agitators? had not dared arm his peons for self-defence in 1910-11 (and his successors rebuilt the family empire along different lines, conforming to the new post- revolutionary mores; so, too, did the Figueroas of Guerrero; the survival of families did not necessarily imply continuity of social structure).105 In Morelos, planters blamed the decay of religion for the belligerence of the campesinos; Rosalie Evans deplored the decline of deference (evident, too, in communities where agrarismo was largely absent) and the consequent uppishness of once docile peons.106 The radical and egalitarian sentiments produced?or revealed ?by the 1910 revolution made landlord rule ofthe old kind impossible. The world turned upside down, even if partly righted after 1915, was never the same again. The principal loss of the landlord class was political rather than economic. Landlord oligarchs no longer ruled the state of the Federation; at best they collaborated with coopted revolutionary generals and strove to contain the challenge of newly mobilised groups. Carranza's wholesale devolution of con- fiscated estates permitted a territorial recovery?at least on paper. But landed wealth divorced from political power was severely impaired.107 Similarly, even modest infringements of landlords' territorial monopoly (and by 1934 a fifth of private land had been alienated under the 'modest' reform of the Sonorans) could have a disproportionate impact.108 For the Porfirian landed class had depended on a growing monopoly of land (and water), bolstered by political power; infringe this monopoly, curtail this power, and the landed interest was seriously threatened, compelled to choose between extinction and rapid adapta- tion to the changed environment. Where Porfirian landlords survived, therefore, they did so by virtue of change, not conservatism (the classic case is William Jenkins of Atencingo).109 Individual or familial survival should not blind us to collective change, induced by the revolution. Porfirian landlords had relied upon a combination of direct (or 'extra- economic') coercion, notably in the debt-peon regions of the south; and of territorial monopoly, which in turn depended on legal, financial and political power. Both were sigmficantlyaffectedby the revolution. Luis Felipe Dominguez Hberated the peons of the notorious monterias of Chiapas; Salvador Alvarado boasted of freeing 100,000 peons in Yucatan.110 American planters, accustomed</page><page sequence="19">THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION 19 to recruit debt-peons, found the system breaking down in the midst of revolu? tion.111 Of course, not all those changes were permanent, and the revolution did not eliminate debt-peonage?of the servile, southern kind?at a stroke. It was left to Carrillo Puerto to remove el ultimo reducto de esclavitud in Yucatan (the notorious plantation of Catmis), and to press on with efforts to organise the Yucatecan field hand and transform him into a unionised agricultural worker'; efforts which culminated?albeit imperfectly?in the Cardenista reforms ofthe 1930s.112 In central Mexico, the elimination of the landlord interest went furthest and fastest in Morelos, where the planters lost over half their land and now even faced commercial competition from a reconstituted peasantry. A Junker road to agrarian capitalism, which had appeared to open during the Porfiriato, was closed off, in favour of a farmer road (the development of capitalism on the basis of peasant farming and kulakization).113 Or, indeed, in favour of no road at all, for it is not clear that the reconstituted peasantry of Morelos pro? vided an appropriate vehicle for the advance of capitalism.114 Since 1940, it is true, such a reconstituted peasantry?the recipient of land grants since the revolution?has served the interests of capital accumulation and industrialisa- tion; previously, however, the place of the peasantry within such a capitalist project was uncertain or anomalous. Agrarian reform, in other words, could mean different things at different times, and it is a further teleological error to assume that all agrarian reform?including that ofthe 1920s and 1930s? was equally functional to the development of capitalism.115 If, from the point of view of capitalism, the revolution's reconstitution of the peasantry was ambivalent, its impact on the hacienda system itself was more clear-cut, and arguably crucial. Furthermore, this impact was not confined to regions of exceptional agrarismo (like Morelos). Throughout much of the country, the hacienda faced both the challenge of the 'external' peasantry, covetous of hacienda land (a challenge whose intensity varied from place to place) and also more insidious, indirect, and pervasive threats which, emanating from the revolution, struck at the very rationale of hacienda production. To appreciate this, we must return to the Porfiriato. The dynamic growth in demand and investment which affected rural Mexico in the later nineteenth century occurred in a society already possessing existing, reasonably well- defined territorial units.116 Large estates were well established (though this is not to say that all estates were large, or that estates were not bought, sold, inherited, parcelled and consolidated); they had benefited from the desamortizacion policies begun by the liberals of the 1850s, as well as from the 'colonization' laws of the Diaz period. It is entirely clear (and no longer worth labouring the point) that haciendas operated within a market and sought profits?this was true of pre-Porfirian as well as Porfirian hacendados.117 What is more contentious and interesting is the rationale which underlay hacienda production, especially as market demand grew in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Commentators like Molina Enriquez, who denounced the sprawling acres and 'feudal' mentality of Porfirian hacendados, were mis- taken, but not entirely mistaken (indeed, it would be odd if so many com? mentators, Mexican and foreign, contemporary and later, were so consistently in error).118 The scale and apparent autarkic strivings of Porfirian haciendas</page><page sequence="20">20 BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH denoted not some feudal/seigneurial mentality, but rather an economically rational response to circumstances; circumstances of rising demand, limited capital, initially cheap land (which grew more costly with time), initially dear labour (which grew cheaper with time, population growth, and peasant dis- possession) and, above all, a highly congenial politico-legal climate. The expansion of holdings thus not only augmented resources (land and? sometimes more crucial?water), but also generated a growing labour supply; so successfully that by the late nineteenth century the objective necessity of debt peonage was waning in many parts of Mexico.119 In Morelos, the land- lord's strongest sanction was not coercion but eviction from the estate.120 In addition, the dispossession of villagers and smallholders eliminated competition in the production of staple crops, while a favourable tariff kept out foreign grain. Large landholdings (and 'largeness', in this context, was relative to local conditions) thus guaranteed cheap labour, high prices and good profits. But? a familiar economic dilemma?these individual advantages had collective draw- backs, above all for the continued capitalist development which the Porfirians (including most landlords) favoured. Such development required the growth of a vigorous kulak class and/or the proletarianisation of the peasantry (in fact, historically and theoretically, the two trends seem to conspire).121 For many, these trends are definitionally required, since capitalism is theoretically con? stituted by relations of production involving free wage labour: production for the market, the old Frankian axiom, cannot alone denote capitalism.122 (It should be added that, since agriculture is not entirely analogous to industry, it may not experience the same degree ofthorough proletarianisation: peasants, in other words, may survive within demonstrably capitalist societies, possibly as 'disguised proletarians'.123 The existence of peasants in modern Mexico no more makes Mexico 'feudal', or 'pre-capitalist', than the existence of proletarians in Habsburg Mexico made it 'capitalist'.) But, definitions aside, there is a prac- tical point, which should impress even those who have no time for definitional polemics. In the absence of a significant kulakization and/or proletarianisation, the scope of the market would remain much reduced, since the bulk of the population would depend on subsistence agriculture and payment in kind, with major market transactions being confined to cities and international trade: the circumstances which prevailed in Mexico or Chile ca. 1850.124 Though these circumstances would admit of significant foreign trade (as medieval eco? nomies did), they would form no basis for capitalist development, even along the lines of desarrollo hacia afuera. Capitalist development required kulakization and/or proletarianisation not just on definitional grounds, but also as a practical prerequisite of the creation of a domestic market, of capital accumulation and of industrialisation. Desarrollo hacia afuera Vorked' precisely in those areas? like Argentina and southern Brazil?where export earnings facilitated an expan? sion of the domestic market (itself premised on European immigration and therefore higher cash wages); not?as in coastal Peru or Central America? where the demand for labour could be met by subsistence wages and forms of contract labour.125 Porfirian Mexico approximated to the second examples. The south?'bar- barous Mexico'?developed forms of debt-peonage, some of which closely resembled slavery.126 On the traditional haciendas of central Mexico, meanwhile,</page><page sequence="21">THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION 21 the transition to free wage labour (or kulakisation) was blocked by the impera? tives of hacienda production. Here, the more 'progressive' landlords favoured, and sometimes stimulated, a switch from 'traditional' forms of remuneration (labour rent, whereby peons received plots of land in return for work on the demesne; payments in kind, including notional cash payments which were offset by the 'purchase' of subsistence goods) to cash wages. This was entirely logical, given that the labour supply was growing, at least in central Mexico, while the opportunity costs of certain 'traditional' forms of remuneration? e.g. land and staple foods?were rising. But while converting to wage payments, landlords were reluctant to adjust wages in line with prices: wages were 'up- wardly sticky'. Hence, despite price inflation, wage rates rose only haltingly and modestly (the same appears to have been true of the mines during the revolution).127 In consequence, rural workers faced a severe squeeze on living standards, to which they responded by reverting to traditional perquisites: payments in kind, cash advances against the purchase of foodstuffs. Hacendados found themselves allowing debts to run up despite themselves.128 At San Antonio Tochatlaco, a market-oriented hacienda run by a progressive management, the attempt to eliminate debts and payments in kind proved abortive; by the 1900s both had to be restored.129 As a result, the hacienda's healthy profits during the 1900s depended not only on Mexico City's growing thirst for pulque, but also on its capacity to cut monetary costs by increasing non-monetary payments to its hard-pressed work force. While a concentration on the hacienda balance sheet (monetary outgoings and income), ofthe kind which hacienda case studies frequently present, would in this case suggest a highly successful, 'capitalist' enterprise, the inclusion of the labour force (the relations of production) in the calculation reveals a significant and growing dependence on non-capitalist (feudal?) forms of remuneration.130 This would help explain the prevalence of debts on other haciendas in the region, notwithstanding the relatively abundant labour supply and the hacendados' antipathy towards endebted labour.131 In that hacienda studies often concentrate on the enterprise's external rela? tions (its role in the market, its formal balance sheet) and do not penetrate the internal relations of production, it is difficult to say how far this example is typical. Obviously, as cases ranging from Eastern Europe to the Caribbean and Mexico indicate, profits can rise on the basis of relations of production which are patently non-capitalist, i.e. in which free wage labour is absent, very limited, or, where it appears to exist, purely formal.132 This may be prob- lematic for the individual enterprise (such as San Antonio Tochatlaco) but the problem can be lived with: while profits accrue, the enterprise will prosper and the 'contradictions' will not prove terminal. But the consequences for the economy as a whole are serious. Under such conditions, which are not those of a free market, individual profit will not redound to collective develop? ment. Problems?or 'contradictions'?may be discerned in three areas. First, landlord monopoly of resources and the associated survival?even reinforcement?of pre-capitalist relations of production inhibited the ration- alisation of agricultural production. Again, this is not a question of 'feudal' or 'seigneurial' mentality, Porfirian landlords innovated and invested (some lavishly and boastfully)133 where it seemed profitable to do so. But investment usually flowed into transport, processing and irrigation. So long as labour could be</page><page sequence="22">22 BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH secured cheaply (even, in a sense, gratuitously, given the low opportunity cost of payment in land) there was little incentive to mechanise. Compared with their North American counterparts, Mexican grain producers enjoyed higher profits on the basis of lower productivity.134 Hence Raigosa's critique of Porfirian agriculture: 'a salario bajo, agricultura pobre y producto caro'.135 Second, low productivity and low wages (or wages in kind) constrained the growth of the national market, a crucial prerequisite for industrialisation. On the one hand, the great peon mass, pushed to the margin of subsistence, displayed what a German entrepreneur (writing after the revolution, but expressing sentiments even more applicable to pre-1910) called 'verdammte bediirfnislosigkeit' ('damned wantlessness').136 Hence the textile industry faced a crisis of over-production, which in turn compounded the 'social question' of the 1900s; individual factories failed for want of a mass market.137 And, while low wages prevented the rural sector from providing a market for indus? trial goods, low productivity combined with imperfect competition to force up the price of staple foods (certainly by the 1900s if not before), thus squeez- ing wages and disposable incomes.138 Finally, the structure of agricultural production inhibited capitalist develop? ment by diverting resources into the inefficient, monopolistic agrarian sector. The landlords' monopoly ensured profits, whether as direct producers (the planters of Morelos and points south) or rentiers (the hacendados of Guerrero or the Bajio).139 It was economically rational (not atavistically 'feudal') to buy into land rather than industry or commerce (which were heavily?though not exclusively?dependent on foreign capital). Why invest in railways at 6%, a deputy asked in 1878, when 12% was readily available elsewhere; or when, it might be added, Mexican corn producers might count on over 50% in the 1900s?140 The very profitability of hacienda production, often cited as evidence of its 'capitalist' character, exercised a macro-economic effect detrimental to capitalist development. In neo-classical terms, the returns to one factor of pro? duction (land) distorted the market to the detriment of consumers, wage- earners, and industrialists. Alternatively, the landlords' extraction of 'absolute ground rent' inhibited capital accumulation and the transition to capitalist relations of production.141 In similar fashion, the political arrangements which underlay this pattern of development (above all, by guaranteeing the landlords' monopolistic position) have been variously described: in terms of Barrington Moore's 'revolution from above', whereby pre-industrial elites and 'labour- repressive' agriculture were preserved by a project of 'conservative modernisa- tion'; or in terms of the different alliances sketched by Amin, characterised by 'high prices for subsistence goods, thus dearer wages, lower profits (and the liberation) . . . ofthe beneficiaries of this landed monopoly from the permanent obligation to improve techniques of production, under the spur of competition which no industrialist can escape'.142 These constraints or 'contradictions' were not terminal. There is no evidence that the Porfirian 'revolution from above' was inherently doomed, ca. 1910.143 It required a political crisis?arguably a gratuitously self-induced political crisis?to topple the regime and allow social conflicts to come to the fore. In the absence of such a crisis, the 'revolution from above' would no doubt have soldiered on, contradictions and all, as others have for generations. But equally,</page><page sequence="23">THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION 23 there is no evidence that the Porfirian regime could have overcome these contra? dictions by pre-emptive reform: the landlord interest was too entrenched, too powerful, to permit the radical changes which a policy of genuine reform would have entailed. In the absence of revolution, in other words, the landlord class would have survived, as it did elsewhere in Latin America, until cumulative political, economic and demographic changes ensured that reform would come officially, almost consensually.144 As a challenge to vested interests, as a con- frontation of class and class, and as a break with the past, the agrarian reforms of, say, Bolivia in the 1950s or Peru in the 1960s, cannot compare with those of Mexico between 1910 and 1940. As regards the agrarian constraints and contradictions of the Porfiriato, the revolution had a decisive, if not immediate impact. Chief among its effects was the debilitation, ultimately the destruction, of the hacienda system. This is not to say that the revolutionary leadership was ardently agrarista, or that the peasantry emerged as an unquaUfied beneficiary of the revolution. On the contrary, much of the debilitation and destruction was unplanned (and even lamented by the leadership), and not until the mid-1930s did official policy espouse thoroughly agrarista objectives. Nor did the hacienda's demise uniformly benefit the campesinos, some of whom lost the relative security of acasillado status, some of whom, acquiring inadequate ejidal plots, exchanged the domina? tion of hacendado for that of ejidal cacique.145 Hence, in some districts, the agrarian reform was imposed on a recalcitrant peasantry.146 But it is quite wrong therefore to deny the agrarian changes set in motion by the revolution. Revolu? tions, in their 'functional' sense, are reckoned to affect class relations in some significant way; they are not (in Mao's phrase) 'dinner parties . . . or doing embroidery'; nor are they neat exercises in the redistribution of the social product, Social-Democratic style.147 It is not clear that the French peasantry was better off in the generation after the Revolution than it had been in the generation before, but that did not mean that little had changed or that the Revolution was no revolution. As in Mexico a century later, French peasants exchanged one master (the seigneur) for another (the usurer); in parts of southern France 'there was little peasant sympathy for a revolution tht was viewed as urban, anticlerical and "northern" \148 The unpopularity of the (Mexican) revolution, now stressed (and possibly exaggerated) by revisionist historians, may best be seen not as a consequence of'revolutionary' conservatism, hence of the absence of social change, but rather as a grass-roots repudiation of change that was dramatic, but unwelcome. And much of this change was un? planned and impersonal, the work, so it seemed, of remote deities who played with human destinies as callously in Azuela's stories as in Homer's. Landlords, often losing their political clout, also faced threats to their eco? nomic survival. The physical destruction wrought by the Revolution (and affecting agriculture more than industry) should not be underestimated. 'The ruins of formerly prosperous estates could be seen all along our route' from Mexico City north towards Queretaro, a traveller noted in the 1920s; he recorded similar sights down on the Isthmus and north of the Bajio.149 More important, the old rationale of hacienda farming no longer applied: erstwhile monopolies of land were eroded (even a modest agrarian reform could achieve that); labour had become more costly and more fractious; the state now</page><page sequence="24">24 BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH intervened by way of land distribution (however patchy), labour legislation (however cosmetic), and taxation. In many states, the physical and economic insecurity of the hacienda was perpetuated by running battles with local agraristas.150 Thus, even in the absence of the sweeping reform which character- ised Morelos,151 a series of more insidious pressures was at work. Both the deference and the abundance of labour were compromised by the revolution. 'Essentially', Gruening observed, 'the hacendados' objection was not so much to parting with a few acres of their vast estates, but to losing their serfs. That was what the restoration of the communal lands inevitably spelled'.152 The hinterland of San Felipe del Progreso (northern Mexico state) spent the revolu? tion in 'an uneasy tranquility', occasionally punctuated by agrarian violence; by the 1920s the local haciendas faced organised agrarismo, the first official reforms, and straitened economic circumstances; one, Tepetitlan, went bust and passed into the hands of its bank in 1929. 'Now you could say the hacienda was in decadence', its manager lamented, 'because the agrarian movement was on top of us; the hacienda wasn't functioning as in the old days'.153 Similar complaints emanated from states like Chiapas and Guerrero (neither states of known agrarista reputation) where Governors Vidal and Castrejon respectively were blamed for accelerating land reform, inciting agrarista organisation, and raising hacendados' tax bills. 'On real estate particularly, in the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca', it was reported, 'there has been a heavy increase, not only in the rate but (also) in the assessed (fiscal) valuations on both urban and rural pro? perties'.154 At San Antonio Tochatlaco, taxes and wages both rose with the revolution, leaving the enterprise scarcely viable.155 Thus, well before Cardenas took the offensive against the great commercial haciendas of Yucatan, the Laguna and the Yaqui valley, and, in doing so, pushed the figures of formal reform to unprecedented levels, haciendas through? out the country had been exposed to inexorable pressures. Some landlords fled during the revolution, never to return; some migrated (from Morelos to Jalisco, for example); some were driven by peasant pressure or market forces to sell up, wholly or partly?in the Bajio, where parcellisation was accelerated by the revolution, or in the Sierra Alta of Hidalgo, where the pre-emptive sales of declining hacendados helped encourage the formation of a new class of middle peasants.156 A good many landlords, driven to the city and deprived of their patrimony, set up in business and founded new fortunes.157 Meanwhile, those many who remained (and sometimes prospered), did so less on the basis of territorial monopoly and political back-up (which, notwithstanding the co-option of revolutionary generals, was never so great as in the days of Diaz), than by means of economic rationalisation and innovation. The way forward was blazed by entrepreneurial landlords like William Jenkins, who subtly countered agrarista agitation, struck new alliances with revolutionary politicos, and progressively shed his sprawling acres, while retaining control of the crucial, central, industrial complex of Atencingo.158 Jenkins, in other words, exchanged a local land for a local industrial monopoly (the trade-off which foreign interests, also in the sugar market, achieved in Cuba during the same period).159 Or, in another terminology, he switched from the extraction of absolute to the extrac? tion of relative surplus value; that is, he became a fully-fledged agrarian capitalist. In Mexico, as elsewhere in Latin America, therefore, the biggest, clearest,</page><page sequence="25">THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION 25 economic consequence of agrarian reform was the rationalisation of estate agriculture; the forced conversion of traditional' (that is, 'feudal', 'semi-feudaF, or 'pre-capitalist') hacendados into 'modern', capitalist entrepreneurs, It was a conversion which the revolutionary leaders favoured, if not in so many words. Cardenas protected Jenkins; Calles, no mean exponent of commercial agriculture himself, urged that the latifundistas will gain by conceding lands to the villages of the Republic, so that they (the latifundistas), exploiting that part ofthe land which remains to them, shall become real agriculturalists . . . and they will cease to be exploiters of men'.161 That is to say: exploitation would proceed through the anonymity of the market, rather than through palpable monopoly and coercion. Though Calles, Cardenas and others worked to hasten this transition, they did not set it in motion, nor were their official efforts necessarily the most efficacious. The dissolution of the great estate, begun amid the chaos of the revolution and unprecedented in Latin America at the time, formed part (the most important part) of a general socio-economic convulsion, characterised by armed rebellion, popular mobilisation, and economic upheaval (rampant infla? tion as well as physical destruction). The declasse landlords of Morelos or the Bajio (like the parents of the Sinarquista leader, Abascal) had their 'middle class' counterparts, such as Lombardo Toledano and Gomez Morfn, who had been cut loose from secure economic moorings by the revolutionary upheaval.162 And there were peasant communities, too, which acquired a new fluidity, a new spatial mobility (as refugees fled Morelos for Guerrero, left the mountains for the lakes of Michoacan, or sought shelter and work in the United States); which experienced the decline of old mores?religious, sexual, familial?and which experimented with new economic activities, like Tepoztlan's orgy of charcoal- burning.163 The economic innovation forced upon the landlords ofthe Porfiriato was similarly thrust upon the peasantry. Thus, more than most revolutionary sloganising, the ethic of work and reconstruction tirelessly preached by the Sonorans and their minions accorded with reality and, perhaps, entered receptive ears. 'Forget the Revolution', the new municipal president of Azteca told the people, 'What's done is done! Whoever is dead is dead. Those that are left are left! So, go on, get to work. Make charcoal and go and sell it'. And the people did: 'we believed in Montoya and went to work to improve things'.164 Out of the maelstrom of revolution, therefore, emerged a society which, compared with pre-1910, was more open, fluid, mobile, innovative, and market- oriented. If this sounds a Friedmanite idyll, it was not. For deracine peasants and hacendados alike, change was brusque, violent, far from idyllic. But Friedmanite, in a sense, it was, since the revolution fostered conditions appro? priate to capitalism, which 'continuously . . . transforms the division of labour within society, incessantly shifting masses of capital and masses of labour from one branch of production to another . . . (and) gives rise to changes in work, to a flux of functions, to a many-sided mobility of the worker'.165 The creation of these conditions, I repeat, was less the result of conscious efforts, than of collective struggles whose outcome was unforeseen and unplanned; Skocpol's de-emphasis ofthe purposive elements of revolution is, in the Mexican case, largely warranted.166 Thus, just as the 'seigneuriaF mentality of the Porfiriato (and before) reflected prevailing material conditions and social</page><page sequence="26">26 BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH relations, so, too, the ruthless entrepreneurialism of the 1920s, captured by Blasco Ibanez, was a true mirror of the age.167 The revolution, we are often told, had much that was neo-Porfirian about it. At a very general level, this may be true. The broad aims of the Porfirian regime?state-building and capitalist development?were continued. But they were continued by other means, in radically changed circumstances, and thus much more efficaciously. An excessive concentration on formal changes (laws, decrees, official reforms), and a corresponding neglect of informal changes, easily leads to misapprehension: to an ultra-Tocquevillean conclusion that the revolution changed little or that, at least, the more things changed the more they stayed the same. But to continue the Porfirian pattern of develop? ment grosso modo?to build the capitalist Leviathan?the revolution had to wreak major changes; had to place government on a surer, institutional founda? tion; and had, above all, to resolve the stultifying contradictions of Porfirian agriculture. Though some far-sighted revolutionaries willed both the ends and the means (Alvarado with his attack on debt-peonage; Calles with his advice to the latifundista), most did not, and change came willy-nilly, especially in the earlier years. Above all, it was the force of popular mobilisation and revolt which cracked the shell of the old regime, and obliged governors, landlords and employers to reckon with new circumstances. In that these new circumstances involved enhanced market production, labour mobility, and capital accumulation, it is entirely valid to regard the Mexican revolution as, in some sense, a bourgeois revolution. Not because it was the conscious work of the bourgeoisie (still less the national bourgeoisie); nor because it instantly transmuted the base metal of feudalism into the pure gold of capitalism (for, it has already been suggested, bourgeois revolutions are by their very nature cumulative phenomena); but rather because it gave a decisive impulse to the development of Mexican capitalism and of the Mexican bourgeoisie, an impulse which the preceding regime had been unable to give. This impulse, the most powerful in a series going back to 1854 (or even 1810?), resulted in a bourgeoisie ultimately more capable of carrying through its political and economic 'project': 'the difference between the Mexican bourgeoisie and that of other Latin American countries is that the former lost its revolutionary faculties after making ample use of them, while the others have never led and will never lead a bourgeois revolution. Here lies the secret of the stability of Mexico's bourgeois regime, and the explanation?not of its exceptionality? but of its differences as compared with countries like Brazil, Argentina, Chile, etc.'.168 The idea that a popular, agrarian revolution, leading on to a widespread agrarian reform, should be categorised as 'bourgeois' is historically quite logical. But it requires a brief, final comment. Peasant participation in 'bourgeois' revolutions has been the subject of repeated comment and analysis: 'the Re? forma tion . . . is the No.l bourgeois revolution', Engels puts it, with disarming simplicity, 'the peasant war being its critical episode'.169 Dobb traced the origins of English capitalism to differentiation among the late medieval peasantry and the growth of 'a sort of kulak class', which he compared to its nineteenth- century Russian equivalent.170 Lenin, too, came round to the view that capitalism would develop more swiftly and surely on the basis of peasant farming than on</page><page sequence="27">THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION 27 the basis of the great estates: the 'Junker road' was, perhaps, a dead end, in Tsarist Russia as in Porfirian Mexico.171 Hence the tiationalisation' of land? notionally achieved after 1917?would constitute a 'radical democratic- bourgeois' programme, to the advantage of industry.172 A similar rationale lay behind the agrarian reform of twentieth-century Latin America, at least as regards some of their protagonists and most of their objective effects. De Janvry makes the point, if too sweepingly: 'all twentieth-century land reforms in Latin America except the Cuban and possibly the Nicaraguan ones have had the ultimate purpose of fomenting the development of capitalism in agriculture'.173 In the particular case of Mexico, the agrarian reform ultimately benefited industry by deepening the domestic market (this was certainly true by the 1930s, if not before), by shaking out capital from land into industry, as already mentioned, and by rendering agriculture more efficient, thus capable of pro- ducing cheap food, exports, and a net transfer of resources from countryside to city.174 More generally, it may be argued, the revolution also provided the political structures within which these processes could develop without serious upheaval. The agrarian revolution, in short, laid the basis for the rapid capitalist growth of the last generation. These developments, however, were not evident until after the 1940s. And it would constitute a form of gross teleology, of the kind I have criticised, to see the post-1940s pattern of development as flowing ineluctably from the 1910 revolution. Rather, as Hamilton puts it, the revolution opened up various 'structural options'; subsequent events, subsequent conflicts, would determine the options taken, the options discarded. The post-1940s 'project'?the 'pre- ferred revolution'?was ultimately chosen, partly, but not entirely, by con- scious decision. Alternative options were scouted. Cardenismo, I would argue, was a case in point. Maybe, as Hamilton has also suggested, Cardenismo collided with the 'limits of state autonomy'; nevertheless, even within these confines, Cardenismo diverged from the 'project' of Aleman and his successors; like Goldwater thirty years later, Cardenas offered a choice not an echo.175 Or, in Semo's cautious terms, the Cardenas reforms 'display tendencies towards over- coming bourgeois limits'.176 This would be especially true in the matter of agrarian reform, where Cardenista policies went beyond the destruction of the traditional' hacienda (thus, by implication, beyond the reforms later under- taken by the Bolivian revolution) and attacked capitalist enterprises, like the Laguna plantations or Nueva Lombardia. Though the Cardenista reforms, agrarian and other, were later integrated into a project of capital accumulation, industrialisation, and 'modernised authoritarianism', this was neither their subjective intention, nor their objective consequences, during the Cardenista period. And, given that this radical alternative was, in terms of ideology, leader? ship, and inspiration, a child of the revolution, it must be conceded that the revolution contained within it the genetic potential for a variety of offspring. The post-1940s project?the project, let us say, of Aleman?was perhaps the grandson of the revolution, but it was also the son of World War and Cold War. like Stalinism, Alemanismo was a revolutionary possibility, but not a revolu? tionary certainty. Unilinearity and teleology should be rejected because they distort our under? standing of historical periods?of the revolution, of Cardenismo?but also</page><page sequence="28">28 BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH because they mayblinker our perceptionof the present. If the past is so massively 'over-determined', so (it may be presumed) is the here-and-now. Yet, strangely enough, those who stress the unalloyed domination of state and capital since ca. 1920 are often those most eager to find contemporary cracks in the status quo, through which radical currents might filter. They would do better to recognise that the domination of state and capital has never been monolithic, that the post-revolutionary history of Mexico has been one of dialectical con- flict and change?not unilinear progress?and that that history has left its stamp on contemporary society. The peasants (especially the ejidatarios) may be surrogate proletarians, but the revolution's reconstitution of the peasantry has left an organisational and ideological legacy which cannot be ignored; according to some, Amin's formulation ('objectively proletarianised, the peasant remains, at the level of class consciousness, a small producer') is applicable to Mexico, and has political implications.177 It links, for example, to the continued agrarista rhetoric and?in the case of Echeverria?the agrarista practice of the regime.178 The long-term consequences of the revolution may be a Leviathan state and a dynamic capitalism, but these are themselves the historical products of a distinct national experience, moulded not only from above, but also from below, by the popular upheavals of 1810, 1854 and 1910. Neither repression nor cooption can eliminate this past. It would therefore be rash to assert that all the 'structural options' created by the revolution have been exhausted, that the revolution's legacy has been spent, that the outcome is now clear, fixed, immutable and unilinear. The agrarian reform was declared terminated (by Calles) in 1930; the revolution has been pronounced dead on many occasions since. We may legitimately comment on the revolution's short-term con? sequences, but we summarise its long-term, epochal significance at our peril. As Mao replied, when asked what he thought was the outcome of the French Revolution: It is too early to say'. NOTES 1. Cobb, Richard (1972).

Hodges and Gandy's concept of the Revolution as political and bureaucratic, marked by 'the perpetuation in political power of a new ruling class? the bureaucracy' (p. 122 ff.), is similar. Grand, comparative statolatry is evident in Skocpol: e.g., pp. 35, 285, 287; however, Skocpol's adjectival preferences, tending to the subjective ('striking' is her favourite qualification of revolutionary con- sequences), make it difficult to evaluate just how far the statolatry goes.

The tendency towards land concentration during the Porfiriato was general, but not uniform; in some regions (parts of Michoacan; the Hidalgo sierra) haciendas were parcelled into smallholdings. Parcellisation of ownership of this kind should not, however, be confused with parcellisation of cultivation (by leasing or sharecropping agreements) which, though common enough (in the Bajio, for example), represented an augmentation of landlord/rentier profits, not an abdication of landlord control. 101.

The fact of rapid land concentration suggests yes; but (as I shall discuss) the internal structure of Porfirian haciendas inhibited progress towards free wage labour</page><page sequence="34">34 BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH ?in some, perhaps many, cases. Hence the ambivalence of analysts like Roger Bartra, who, in his interesting article 'Peasants and Political Power in Mexico: A Theoretical Approach', Latin American Perspectives 5 (1975): 127,129, first argues that 'Mexican agriculture at the turn of the century was developing along a road that could be called a Porfirian version of the "via Junker"', then observes that 'the latifundios utilized super-exploitation of the labor force (even using feudal forms). In this way they closed the door to the possibility of a "Junker"-type development in agriculture'. This second position is unequivocally argued by Marco Bellingeri and Enrique Montalvo, 'Lenin en Mexico: la via junker y las contra- dicciones del porfiriato', Historias 1 (1982): 15-29. Like so many historical ques- tions, this one hinges on what is typical or atypical; and, at present, our level of empirical knowledge does not permit a confident answer. Bellingeri and Montalvo have certainly pointed out the barriers which lay in the path of a smooth 'Junker' transition, and which, it is argued here, the Revolution helped demolish. 114. I take Morelos as the best case of thorough, post-revolutionary agrarian reform: the consequences are suggested in Womack, pp. 372-375; though cf. Arturo Warman, . . . Y venimos a contradecir: Los campesinos de Morelos y el estado nacional (Mexico, 1976), pp. 165-168, 178-183. Barta, 'Peasants and political power', takes the classic Marxist view that the agrarian reform, by blocking 'de-peasantisation', created 'an obstacle to capitalist development in agriculture': see pp. 127-128. Magraw, pp. 15, 56-57, suggests a French parallel. 115. See the resume in David Goodman and Michael Redclift, From Peasant to Proletar- ian: Capitalist Development and Agrarian Transitions (Oxford, 1981), pp. 185-213. 116. The relative absence of free land, coupled with growing landlord monopoly of resources, ruled out any general application of the Chayanov principle: peasant farmers were rarely in a position to compete successfully against hacienda production (as they had, for example, in the colonial period). 117. Rather than cite the extensive corpus of work by Enrique Semo, Jan Bazant, David Brading, Charles Harris, Harry Cross, Marco Bellingeri, John Tutino, Simon Miller and others, I would recall John Coatsworth's comment: 'not one estate owner has been found who might qualify as the sort of aristocratic, prestige-oriented, economic nincompoop once thought by many to be typical of Spanish American hacendados"': 'Obstacles to Economic Growth in Nineteenth-Century Mexico', American Historical Review 83 (1978): 87. 118.

'Purely formal' in that the cash wage may consist of credit recycled through the hacienda itself, and cash advances may?according to the classic form of oppressive debt-peonage?serve to maintain a quasi-servile labour force. Thus, not only serfs and slaves, but even some ostensible 'proletarians', may in fact fall short of the definitional requirements of 'free wage labour' (which 'must be doubly free: free from access to land and free from the control of a particular employer')?notwith- standing that their employers may be realising healthy profits in the marketplace.

The economic form and social context of hacienda production differed from region to region (as suggested here); and these differences were important determinants of the 'ecology of revolution' after 1910. For other?e.g. macro-economic?analytical purposes, however, it is the common characteristics of hacienda production which deserve emphasis. 140. Cumberland, Charles C. (1968).

(I am referring to the agrarian reform in the Peruvian sierra, not the coast.) 145. Warman, pp. 68-69, 124-126, 204 on the plight of the Morelos realenos ('trusty' peons); and ibid., pp. 158-161, 182, 192, and Benjamin, p. 249, for examples of the new, ejidal caciquismo. 146.

Rural property, an observer noted in the early 1930s, was 'now very much a wasting asset'; the haciendas had 'fallen upon evil days'; and, even where hacendados clung to their patrimony, it involved them an 'endless, heart-breaking game'; Marett, R. H. K. (1939). An Eye-witness of Mexico (London), pp. 14, 16, 96. Perhaps Marett protested too much; but so, too, do those who argue for the preservation of the rural status quo until the mid-1930s. 151. By the end of 1933 (that is, still prior to the Cardenista reforms) ejidos embraced nearly half the total area of Morelos (47%) and at least four-fifths of the state's crop land: Simpson, Eyler N. (1937). The Ejido: Mexico's Way Out (Chapel Hill), pp 622-623; though cf. also pp. 573-574. 152. Gruening, p. 145. 153. Margolies, pp. 35, 39. 154.

I refer to parcellisation of ownership, not merely cultivation. See Brading, D. A. (1978). Haciendas andRanchos in the Mexican Bajio, Leon 1700-1860 (Cambridge), pp. 208-216; Schryer, Frans J. (1980). The Rancheros of Pisaflores: The History of a Peasant Bourgeoisie in Twentieth-Century Mexico (Toronto), pp. 37, 42, 51, 64-65,78,80-82,93. 157. Several examples of elite survival and diversification can be found in Flavia Derossi, The Mexican Entrepreneur (Paris, 1971); see pp. 22-23,157, 259. 158. See Ronfeldt, Atencingo, passim. 159. Alier, Juan Martinez (1977). Haciendas, Plantations and Collective Farms: Agrarian Class Societies (London), pp. 100-101. 160. De Janvry, chap. 6, especially pp. 211-218. De Janvry's stress on the causal link between agrarian reform and capitalist development (not least in the 'nonreform sector') is appropriate; that is not to say that his typology of reforms (p. 206) is right or that his inference of motive from outcome (note 173, below) is valid. Both stand in need of qualification. 161. Ronfeldt, Atencingo, pp. 19-29; Cordova, p. 317. 162. Meyer, Jean (1979).El Sinarquismo: Un fascismo mexicano? (Mexico), p. 55; Krauze, Enrique (1976).

Marx, Capital, Vol. I,p. 526. 166. Skocpol, pp. 14-18. It should be added that Skocpol's attribution of 'purposive' and 'voluntarist' explanations to other theorists/historians of revolution is consider- ably exaggerated; and her de-emphasis of such explanations leads straight to the statolatrous position criticised earlier in this paper (crudely: popular discontent does not count for much, so long as the state apparatus remains immune to</page><page sequence="37">THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION 37 externally-generated crisis). This position does not follow logically, however, from a critique of purposiveness. And, we may note, Skocpol's key case (South Africa) now looks rather less supportive of her thesis than it did at the time of writing; with luck, it may end up refuting it. 167. Ibanez, V.

Amin and Vergopoulos, p. 58. Cf. Bartra, 'Peasants and Political Power', pp. 140- 144, and Pare, pp. 162-171 who, similarly, derive political conclusions from the survival of 'peasant' attitudes/rhetoric/institutions/policy (which Bartra locates in the 'structure of mediation'), despite the incorporation of peasants (evan as defacto proletarians) into a system of agrarian capitalism. Hodges and Gandy, pp. 210-211, allude to this problem and take the extreme position that the regime's constant recreation of the peasantry (qua peasants, not proletarians) defies the logic of capital and represents the bureaucracy's 'political need for a peasant base'; hence the primary division within Mexican society is not the classic one between workers and capitalists, but rather that between 'capitalists and bureaucrats' (pp. 219, 225). I cannot agree. 178. Sanderson, chap. 7.</page></plain_text>
