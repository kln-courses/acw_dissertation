<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOSHUA PEDERSON "More Life" and More: Harold Bloom, the J Writer, and the Archaic Judaism of Tony Kushner's Angels in America Even sick. I want to be alive I want more life. I can't help myself. I do. I've lived through such terrible times, and there are people who live through much much worse, but You see them living anyway. When they're more spirit than body, more sores than skin, when they're burned and in agony, when flies lay eggs in the corners of the eyes of their children, they live. Tony Kushner, Perestroika [second ellipsis in original] Genesis 32, Jacob - son of Isaac, grandson of Abraham, and third patriarch - sets out with his wives, his children, and his entourage to meet his estranged brother Esau. On the eve of that reunion, by the shores of the river Jabbok, Jacob grapples with an angel - or more specifically, a mysterious man. Though they wrestle until near dawn, neither bests his opponent. As the sun is about to rise, the angel demands that Jacob release him. Jacob agrees, on one condi- tion: "I will not let you go, unless you bless me" (32:26). The angel assents, and Jacob receives both his blessing and a new name, Israel. Prior Walter, the AIDS-stricken hero of Tony Kushner 's Angels in America, whom the author explicitly and implicitly likens to Jacob, also wrestles with an angel. And upon being admitted into the angelic council in one of the last scenes of Perestroika, the play's second part, he demands his own blessing: "more life." "More life" - as Kushner acknowledges in his notes to Perestroika (10, 154-55) - is a translation of the Hebrew word for "blessing" Contemporary Literature 50, 3 0010-7484; E-ISSN 1548-9949/09/0003-0576 © 2009 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System</page><page sequence="2">P E D E R S O N • 577 taken from Harold Bloom and expanded upon in The Book of], Bloom's attempt (with translator David Rosenberg) to tease out and interpret one of the multiple voices that contemporary schol- arship suggests constitute the Torah narrative. Though courteous, this nod toward Bloom is enigmatic in its solitude, for it is the only one that the playwright makes, even though the imaginative fabric of Angels features the ideas of many great thinkers, including Walter Benjamin, Bertolt Brecht, and Ernst Bloch, to name a few. It is, therefore, downright peculiar that Kushner would mention just the seemingly minor influence of Bloom.1 But a closer look at the text itself proves Bloom's presence to be more significant than the gift of a two-word phrase. It seems that Kushner is indebted to Bloom not only for two crucial words - "more life" - but also for much of the play's religious mythology and, by extension, its por- trayal of Judaism. According to Bloom, The Book of] provides readers with glimpses of what he calls an "archaic Judaism" (Book 14), a freer, more dynamic cultic practice unconstrained by the rite and ritual of the temple-centered Judaism of Solomon, during whose reign the J text was putatively written. In what follows, I will argue that Kushner injects Angels with significant doses of J's (or Bloom's) archaic Jewish myth. Indeed, I will suggest that Bloom's J gives Kushner much of the religiosity of his play. But why Bloom? And why, espe- cially for the self -professed agnostic Kushner, the archaic Judaism of J? The answer has something to do with Kushner 's own con- flicted relationship with his Jewish heritage. A close reading of the speech that opens the play - Rabbi Isidor Chemelwitz's eulogy for Sarah Ironson, the grandmother of Prior's boyfriend Louis - yields some insight: 1. Or perhaps this brief reference is just a symptom of Bloom's "anxiety of influence" - an instance of what Bloom calls apophrades, or "the return of the dead": "The strong dead return, in poems as in our lives, and they do not come back without darken- ing the living" (Anxiety 139). James Miller, however, comments on Kushner 's surprising freedom from such anxiety: "When I saw Part I on Broadway in 1993, ... I recall feeling oddly anxious that Kushner was evincing no anxiety of influence - as if he had a moral obligation to acknowledge somewhere in his work the profound political impact of that other gay Jewish Reagan-hating playwright from New York [Larry Kramer] on all serious aids drama produced in the second decade of the epidemic" (62).</page><page sequence="3">578 • CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE She was ...(He touches the coffin) not a person but a whole kind of person, the ones who crossed the ocean, who brought with us to America the vil- lages of Russia and Lithuania - and how we struggled, and how we fought, for the family, for the Jewish home, so that you would not grow up here, in this strange place, in the melting pot where nothing melted. Descendants of this immigrant woman, you do not grow up in America, you and your children and their children with the goyische names. You do not live in America. No such place exists. Your clay is the clay of some Litvak shtetl, your air the air of the steppes - because she carried the old world on her back across the ocean, in a boat, and she put it down on Grand Concourse Avenue, or in Flatbush, and she worked that earth into your bones, and you pass it to your children, this ancient, ancient culture and home. (Little pause) You can never make that crossing that she made, for such Great Voyages in this world do not any more exist. But every day of your lives the miles that voyage between that place and this one you cross. Every day. You understand me? In you that journey is She was the last of the Mohicans, this one was. Pretty soon ... all the old will be dead. {Millennium 10-11; first and third ellipses in original) It is apparent that Chemelwitz's is an atavistic brand of Judaism, a European diasporan Judaism, a religious sensibility that holds on to the ideals of an intrinsically exilic faith when the establishment of the state of Israel and assimilation of Jews into American culture render such sentiments retrograde. God molds Chemelwitz's Jews from "the clay of some Litvak shtetl/' from the soil of an eternally foreign country. Always strangers in strange lands, Jews are Jews because they make journeys to struggle in homes that are not their own, so many journeys, in fact, that journey itself - and not destination - becomes constitutive of the Jewish soul; "In you that journey is," he intones. His is a Judaism of eternal movement, of movement enshrined in a forever dynamic Jewish identity. Motion, not situatedness, is key - homelessness, not home. Such a figuration of Judaism lines up almost perfectly with Kushner's own understanding of what is - or was - best about the Jewish faith. As he said in a 1995 interview, "I think the Diasporan Jewish culture has a magnificent history of progressive involvement with the cultures that Jews have found themselves in and interacting with." Such involvement, according to Kushner, put Judaism in touch</page><page sequence="4">PEDERSON • 579 with "traditions of socialism and humanism" (Tony Kushner 82). For Kushner, much of Judaism's diasporan progressivism has been lost since the establishment of the state of Israel: "[T]here was this tremen- dous support for Israel and that's been part of this calamity - it's driven international Jewish culture from its progressive basis . . . [because] there are important progressive and radical European tradi- tions that arrived with Jews in the U.S that really informed American Jewish consciousness all the way up to the 1950s." It is as if, for Kushner, as for his character Chemelwitz, the placelessness of diasporan Judaism kept it in contact with progressive, tolerant social trends, while the establishment of stable Jewish homelands in Israel and the United States led to the slow attrition of such positive cultural forces. More simply, Judaism is at its best when it is in constant motion, when it is without the ultimately stultifying safeties of tem- ple, state, or homeland. It is for this reason, I suggest, that Kushner takes up Bloom's J narrative of the development of an archaic Jewish faith, for J's tales provide him with an even purer mythology of Jewish dynamism. Chemelwitz's age - indeed, he is so near death that we see him later in heaven - seems to suggest that diasporan Judaism, despite all its positive qualities, is condemned to the dustbin of history for Kushner. In attempting to restore to Judaism its spirit of progressivism, Kushner reaches further back into Jewish history for an even more dynamic portrait of the ancient religious faith: J's archaic Judaism, as interpreted by Harold Bloom. In what follows, I hope to uncover the elements of this archaic Judaism as they appear in Angels in America. Kushner 's appropriation of the imaginative world of J - as interpreted by the ubiquitous Bloom - is neither wholesale nor without its ironies. Indeed, the playwright puts his own stamp on the religious imagery that Bloom has - not always unproblematically - teased from the Torah;2 Kushner occasionally slants or even inverts elements of the J text. But the influence of 2. Early reviews of Bloom's volume both praise its ingenuity and identify significant shortcomings. Jack Miles suggests that Bloom's method is, at times, "brilliantly brought off" but that some of his theses are not new (640). Walter Brueggemann calls his commen- tary "rich and suggestive" but "undisciplined and quixotic" (236). Yehoshua Gitay believes that the J text is "brightly illuminated" (413) by Bloom's reading but also con- demns that reading as "fragmentary" (411). It is not my intent in this essay to defend Bloom's scholarship but only to show its influence on the development of Kushner 's play.</page><page sequence="5">580 -CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE Bloom's reading of J is undeniable, and generative of a more complete understanding of the unique religiosity of Angels. Bloom's J: The Creation of an Author The majority of modern biblical scholarship supports what has come to be known as the "documentary hypothesis," initially pro- posed by Julius Wellhausen in nineteenth-century Germany. This theory suggests that the Torah or Pentateuch - the first five books of the Bible - is the collective composition of no fewer than five writers living at various times in the first millennium before the common era. Scholars have settled on a shorthand for identifying these five writers, referring to them by the letters J, D, P, E, and R. According to the theory, J, D, P, and E are several producers of text; R - or the redactor - is the editor who gathered, molded, and arranged the work of the four other writers to produce a composite text very sim- ilar to today's Torah. In The Book of], Harold Bloom attempts to cull from the composite work of the Torah the writing of one particular author - J, or the Yahwist.3 Bloom works in tandem with David Rosenberg, whose new translation of the putative writing of J Bloom reads and interprets. It's worth emphasizing the eccentricity of Bloom's method. Bloom is a very readerly critic, and his interpretation of the J text is typical of his brand of "strong misreading." "Since we cannot know the circumstances under which the work was composed, or for what purposes," he observes, "ultimately we must rely upon our experience as readers to justify our surmises as to what it is that we are reading" (Book 9). Strong misreading assumes that texts possess only illusory being, and the strong misreader strives not to arrive at a text's truth or essence but instead to "usurp" meaning, to force- fully take hold of a text and use it to establish a position in a lineage of readers and poets.4 Unable to arrive at the "truth" of a text, one instead tries to "make something happen" with it. That which 3. She is called J - not Y, after Yahweh - because the first scholars who distinguished the J author from other authors were German, who transliterated the divine name "Jahweh." 4. The culmination of Bloom's thoughts concerning "strong misreading" appears in Agon.</page><page sequence="6">P E D E R S O N • 581 Bloom tries to "make happen" with the text of the J writer is - in essence - the production of an author: For reasons that I will expound, I am assuming that J lived at or nearby the court of Solomon's son and successor, King Rehoboam of Judah, under whom his father's kingdom fell apart soon after the death of Solomon in 922 B.c.E. My further assumption is that J was not a professional scribe but rather an immensely sophisticated, highly placed member of the Solomonic elite, enlightened and ironic. But my primary surmise is that J was a woman, and that she wrote for her contemporaries as a woman, in friendly competition with her only strong rival among those contempo- raries, the male author of the court history narrative in 2 Samuel. {Book 9) The figure of J that Bloom teases out of The Book of] - who remains an imagined authorial construct - serves to guide us back into the text, fueling further readings and (mis)interpretations.5 Bloom believes that J's is both the most powerful Hebrew text and the earliest. Thus he asserts that J gives us a glimpse of the religious ethos that preceded the Judaism of Solomonic Israel: "What J por- trays, with loving irony, is an archaic Judaism now largely lost to us, though to call it a Judaism at all is bound to be an error" {Book 14). For Bloom, the portrait J provides of this religion remains so vibrant that it forms the imaginative foundation for a variety of scriptures: "J mixes everything available to her and produces a work so com- prehensive and so universal that the entire Hebrew Bible, Greek New Testament, and Arabic Koran could be founded upon it" (18). In brief, her version of religion provides the seed material for all the main Western traditions. This archaic Judaism - strongly misread by Bloom - also shapes the religious message of Kushner's play. Broadly speaking, five aspects of J's Judaism appear in Kushner's text, though not without some irony: J's vision of Yahweh, intensely dynamic and strikingly anthropomorphic; her portrait of Jacob, equally dynamic and somewhat theomorphic; her concept of the blessing "more life"; her glorification of sex and sexuality; and her 5. Bloom's method finds a precedent in Sigmund Freud's Moses and Monotheism, in which Freud strongly misreads Exodus in suggesting that the biblical figure of Moses is an amalgamation of historical figures, the most important of which is an Egyptian disci- ple of the first monotheist, the pharaoh Akhenaton.</page><page sequence="7">582 - CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE thoroughly unlegalistic attitudes toward divine law. It is important to note, for reasons explored below, that these five elements never resolve into a theological system; the dynamic Yahweh who sneaks into and out of Kushner's play will not consent to his own assimila- tion into such a confining matrix. They do, however, come together in privileging anthropology (as opposed to theology), and the reli- gion that the playwright borrows from Bloom and J only strength- ens his own vibrant humanism. In taking on the documentary hypothesis, Bloom wades into muddy waters. Without engaging modern biblical criticism too technically, one may nonetheless note that the theory has changed significantly since Wellhausen first articulated it well over a century ago. Today, many would make no distinction between the J and E sources, opting instead to distinguish between only a priestly (P) author and a nonpriestly author.6 Thus some would argue that Bloom's narrative features only half a voice. Further, scholarly con- sensus is moving toward the position that these multiple authors were not indeed authors at all, but schools of authors - that the Torah is not the product of four or five writers, but of perhaps hun- dreds spaced over centuries.7 So others may contend that Bloom is dealing not with a voice but with a chorus. Finally, Robert Alter points out that while it is helpful to assert the multiple authorship of the Torah, it is impossible - and perhaps harmful - to pull apart those authors' respective contributions: But even if we assume that we know confidently in all significant instances what is J, E, and P [and we frequently do not], there remains the intractable problem of what Sir Edmund Leach has called " unscrambling the omelette/7 Perhaps there once was a splendid J narrative from Adam to Moses, but all that is left of it is what R decided to splice with E and P. The J texts that have come down to us ... are an intermittent, inadequate story, a poor thing compared to the wonderful orchestration that R has made of all his sources. (162-63) 6. Most prominent among these commentators is Richard Elliott Friedman, who points out the stylistic similarities between J and E in Who Wrote the Bible? 7. Michael D. Coogan's introduction to the Pentateuch in The New Oxford Annotated Bible outlines this position (6).</page><page sequence="8">PEDERSON * 583 Hence it is very likely that we - and more importantly, Bloom - have only part of J and can never remake her whole. Bloom's J is therefore an almost imaginary text, as much the creation of the critic as of an ancient author. In the following analysis, I do not presume that Kushner is privy to such intricate scholarly debates. The playwright is intellectually curi- ous, and his work confirms that he is intimately familiar with Bloom's /. I do not wish to argue that Kushner is similarly familiar with the contemporary landscape of biblical scholarship or the lively debates that have sprung up around Bloom's work. Many of the historical discoveries mentioned above came to light only after the publication oí Angels in 1993 and 1994, and while two intervening decades have allowed us ample time to fully interrogate Bloom's theses, the layman Kushner, exploring them in the first several months after the 1990 publication of The Book of], had no such luxury.8 Reveling in Anthropomorphism: J's Yahweh, Kushner's God Bloom hopes, in extracting J's narrative from the composite work of the Torah, to remove her writing from a normative interpretive tra- dition that stifles the dynamism of her text. Bloom scorns the rest of the contributors to the Pentateuch, assuming that they soften or even bastardize the genius of J. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the complex figure of Yahweh. Bloom believes that traditional biblical writing - beginning with the E, D, and P authors - has obscured the contours of J's Yahweh, rendering him amorphous. The divergence between this figure and the God of the rest of the Torah begins with a debate over Yahweh's anthropomorphism - the extent to which he resembles his human creations. Not without some petulance, Bloom contends that while later, more traditional writers try to obscure Yahweh's human elements, J revels in his dynamic similarity to his greatest creation, humankind. Bloom 8. Additionally, one should not take Kushner 's indirect engagement with the docu- mentary hypothesis as a significant challenge to biblical authority. Even given its contem- porary fluidity, the theory has been an accepted part of biblical scholarship for decades in both religious and secular, conservative and liberal circles. Only a small minority of tradi- tional hermeneutists still contend that the Torah was written by Moses alone.</page><page sequence="9">584 -CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE delights in the apparent anthropomorphism of J's Yahweh, noticing how J brings the deity and his creatures into close, intimate associa- tion. Indeed, J's account of the creation of man blurs the distinction between creator and creature, god and man, eternal and carnal. It is this blurring that renders Yahweh such a compelling figure. J's Yahweh alters and even transcends the terms of the anthropomor- phism debate: "[H]er Yahweh is both more and less than anthropo- morphic: he is wild and free, an almost unconditioned impulse. There is a glint in J's eye whenever we receive a portrait of Yahweh, for his restless dynamism will not consent to be confined" (Book 291). Dynamism is Yahweh's hallmark. He is irascible, impish, changeable, intimate, dirty. He has hands and a mouth and grime under his fingernails. In his relations with humankind, he is capable of moments of touching intimacy and fits of childish wrath. His physical and emotional distance from his human creation varies wildly. A lip's breadth away from humanity in the book's first verses, Yahweh suffers a seeming crisis of confidence as the writing continues, pulling away to mountaintops and distant heavens: "Yahweh is presence, is the will to change, is origination and origi- nality. His leading quality is not holiness, or justice, or love, or right- eousness, but the sheer energy and force of becoming, of breaking into fresh being" (294). Maybe not so coincidentally, for Bloom this "sheer energy" describes not only the Yahweh of J's text but the god of Joseph Smith's brand of Mormonism. Though in the following I will treat only Bloom's influence on the Jewish - or "archaic" Jewish - content of Kushner's play, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the critic's likely influence on the play's characterization of Mormonism, another of the important religious influences in Angels. (Three main characters - Hannah, Joe, and Harper - are all Mormons and origi- nally from Utah.) In The American Religion, Bloom identifies Mormonism as one of the three major strands of an authentically American national religion. Further, he considers Smith, its founder, to be one of this country's very few religious geniuses: "He was an authentic religious genius, and surpassed all Americans, before or since, in the possession and expression of what could be called the religion-making imagination" (American Religion 96-97). For Bloom, there are striking similarities that connect Smith's deity to J's Yahweh:</page><page sequence="10">PEDERSON • 585 I think transumptively of the Prophet Joseph's God when I read the text of the Yahwist, or J Writer, author of the earliest tales of the Pentateuch. The Yahweh who closes Noah's ark with his own hands, descends to make on- the-ground inspections of Babel and Sodom, and who picnics with two angels under Abram's terebinth trees at Mamre is very close, in personal- ity and dynamic passion, to the God of Joseph Smith, far closer than to the Platonic-Aristotelian divinity of Saint Augustine and Moses Maimonides. (101) Perhaps Bloom's understanding of the dynamism of Smith's God partially accounts for the principal role that Mormonism plays in Kushner's religious vision in Angels, and for the strong bond that quickly develops between Hannah and Prior, the standard-bearer for J's archaic Judaism. This remarkable dynamism - the eternal changeability of J's deity, be he Mormon, archaic Jewish, or otherwise - fuels the cre- ation of Kushner's cosmology in Angels in America. The epigraph with which Kushner opens the second half of the play - Ralph Waldo Emerson (in "On Art") on the nature of the soul - could as well apply to J's Yahweh and Kushner's God: "Because the soul is progressive, it never quite repeats itself, but in every act attempts the production of a new and fairer whole" (Perestroïka 11). This quo- tation gestures toward the continual breaking into newness that characterizes J's Yahweh. Kushner's play explores the dialectical relationship that exists between dynamism - so effectively embod- ied by J's Yahweh - and its polar opposite, stasis. The first conversa- tion between Prior and the Angel - who breaks through the ceiling of Prior's bedroom to enlist him as a new prophet for stasis - helps to flesh out this relationship. Prior, who is recounting his revelation to his ex-lover Belize, provides his own version of the Angel's tale: "In making people God apparently set in motion a potential in the design for change, for random event, for movement forward" (Perestroika 42). God, bored or uninterested with his first, angelic creation - "they're basically incredibly powerful bureaucrats" (41), mutters Prior - creates humanity in order to introduce an aleatory spark into what must have become a staid, if fabulous, universe. At least before the play's cosmic present, Kushner's God - though possessing enough of a sense of change and randomness to instill it within humans - remains a stable heavenly presence. Nonetheless,</page><page sequence="11">586* CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE God's creation of a changeable humanity paves the way not only for "Sleeping Creation's Potential for Change" (Perestroika 42) but also for his own revitalization. After the creation of humanity, Kushner's God begins to develop. The Angel continues: He began to leave Us! Bored with His Angels, Bewitched by Humanity, In Mortifying imitation of You, his least creation, He would sail off on Voyages, no knowing where. (Perestroika 43) Belize, savvy interpreter that he is, "smell[s] a motif" (44), likening God to all the play's departing lovers and positing a time before the creation of humanity, before God's relationship with his angelic harem, when the Divine reveled in his own dynamic, cos- mic bachelorhood. The deity's midnight wanderings - and ulti- mate departure - signify the changeability innate in his being. His flight mimics that of J's Yahweh, who is quite intimate with Adam and his nameless wife but eventually moves away, becoming for Moses a distant voice, an occasional presence given to flights of violence. For Bloom there is something innately contradictory about J's efforts to represent Yahweh, for to do so "is to compromise his relentless dynamism. For J's Yahweh, ... as for J, everything that matters most is perpetually new" (Book 311). The textual representa- tion of Yahweh partially reifies him and perhaps pins him down in the midst of - and almost in spite of - his changes. Hence it is not unimportant that Kushner's God is gone. Unwilling to have his dynamism compromised by artistic depiction, Kushner's God leaves the stage before the play begins, rendering the situation of the angels who hope for his return downright Beckettian.9 Of course, to say that God is absent from the play is not entirely true. He appears once - a pulsing, red aleph - in a nonspeaking role, addressed by the deceased Roy Cohn, who offers to represent him in some sort of cosmic court. (Cohn, Kushner's fictionalized version 9. David Savran numbers the Beckettian hints in Kushner's play among many nods to figures from the "long history of Western dramatic literature" (15).</page><page sequence="12">PEDERSON * 587 of the crooked McCarthy-era prosecutor and Reagan-era power broker, has recently died of aids.) But what may be more important about this scene than its presence in the play is Kushner's insistence in the notes that it be optional.10 Though the scene may provide posthumous redemption for Cohn, it also compromises the dynamism of an otherwise unrepresented God. Another optional scene - act 5, scene 6 - also weakens the play's dynamism. In it, Prior and the now-deceased Rabbi Chemelwitz have a chat in heaven. The rabbi is playing cards with Louis's grandmother and explains to Prior how card-playing brings joy to the afterlife: "Cards is strategy but mostly a game of chance. In Heaven, everything is known. To the Great Questions are lying about here like yesterday's newspaper all the answers. So from what comes the pleasures of Paradise? indeterminacyV {Perestroika 134). Like Kushner's represen- tation of God in conversation with Cohn, the rabbi's speech com- promises the dynamism of humanity. Dead, it appears as if humanity becomes subject to the same stasis that the angels repre- sent, stealing from them their defining characteristic along with their life. An Ironic Jacob: The Untheomorphic Last Walter and a Dubious Blessing In the "playwright's notes" to Perestroika (7), Kushner confirms his "indebtedness to Harold Bloom's reading of the Jacob story" (10). In contrast to his appropriation of J's Yahweh, however, Kushner's use of her Jacob is playful, even ironic. If, for J, Yahweh lowers himself and comes to resemble his creation, Jacob is the patriarch who most boldly lifts himself up to meet God halfway; put differently, Yahweh's anthropomorphism is dialectically matched with Jacob's theomorphism. Bloom explains, "Indeed, [Jacob] is theomorphic precisely because J's Yahweh is so outrageous; Jacob is as cunning as 10. Ironically, this optional scene allows readers of the play to read Kushner's God as an actual character in Angels in America. Though some may choose to treat God's depar- ture in the play's prehistory as purely symbolic - as Kushner's indication that Angels is set in a post-theistic or post-religious world - his fleeting appearance onstage allows us to follow Bloom in treating this enigmatic God as a literary figure deserving of charac- terological analysis.</page><page sequence="13">588 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE Yahweh, and like Yahweh possesses in abundance. . . subtle, naked consciousness" (Book 209). n Jacob proves his theomorphic cunning in his pursuit of the blessing. But J's blessing is different from that of the other Torah authors. First, J's blessing deals not only with the imperative or privilege of fruitfulness and multiplication ("Be fruit- ful and multiply") but also with the proliferation of one's name, which it "preserves and extends" (Book 210). But on a more compre- hensive level, the blessing has something to do with life itself, and more of it. In this respect, the blessing is less a guarantee than a burning spur that drives its possessors to a relentless pursuit of vitality and change. Though Kushner may well be indebted to Bloom for the latter 's reading of Jacob, his indebtedness is subtle and complex. Kushner 's play acts as a prism that separates the aspects of J's Jacob, distilling them in different amounts in different characters. I want to suggest that Prior - the character whom critics have most frequently likened to Jacob - is at best an ironic patriarch, an unwilling participant in the divine plan. (I maintain that the play's true Jacob is Roy Cohn, who is every bit as dynamic, irascible, and cunning as J's Jacob or, for that matter, J's God.) However, Prior and Roy aside, it is Joe Pitt - the Mormon appellate-court clerk who is also Roy's protégé - who introduces Jacob into the play's narrative by comparing himself to Jacob in the patriarch's struggle with the angel: It's me. In that struggle. Fierce, and unfair. The angel is not human, and it holds nothing back, so how could anyone human win, what kind of a fight is that? It's not just. Losing means your soul thrown down in the dust, your heart torn out from God's. But you can't not lose. {Millennium 49) A far cry from J's Jacob, who is persistent and hungry for the blessing the angel will yield, Joe wrestles only to avoid the pain of loss. (For Joe, Jacob's bout with the angel serves as a metaphor for his own struggle with homosexual urges he can no longer ignore; Joe eventu- ally leaves his wife Harper and takes up with Louis.) If J defines the 11. On a related note, Bloom credits Joseph Smith with restoring the "Bible's sense of the theomorphic" in nineteenth- and twentieth-century religious practice (American Religion 99).</page><page sequence="14">PEDERSON • 589 struggle between Jacob and the angel in terms of possibility and blessing, Joe defines it in terms of disparity and injustice. Prior, who before ascending to heaven in the play's last act actu- ally wrestles angels (and who, unlike Joe, begs for a blessing), also differs from J's Jacob.12 Though sometimes wily and dynamic, Prior (unlike J's Jacob) is not theomorphic; he neither resembles nor wishes to resemble God. For Kushner's vision of the divine is just another version of Belize's unreliable male. Joe abandons Harper; Louis abandons Prior; God abandons his angels and his creation. But Prior does no such thing. Prior is mature, steadfast, and emo- tionally stable. He rails against changeable lovers who slip out the back door when the going gets rough. Furthermore, the blessing sought by the angel-wrestling Prior has nothing to do with either genetic transmission or generational continuity. Barring adoption or in vitro fertilization (an option that, although mentioned, remains unlikely given Prior's AiDS-tainted blood), Prior will be the last of the Walters, Kushner puns. Prior's plea for more life at play's end is ironic at the expense of J's Jacob. More life for Prior means more sus- ceptibility to contagion, more disease, more pain. When Prior pleads with the angels - "I still want My blessing. Even sick. I want to be alive" (Perestroika 131) - he does so in spite of the pain implicit in the additional life he will ultimately receive. Prior's vit- riol in addressing the angels proves just how untheomorphic he is, just how fervently he wishes to embrace humanity's plight: We can't just stop. We're not rocks - progress, migration, motion is. . . modernity. It's animate, it's what living things do. We desire. Even if all we desire is stillness, it's still desire for. Even if we go faster than we should. We can't wait . And wait for what? God . . . (Perestroika 130; ellipses in original) 12. James Miller and Alisa Solomon both recognize Prior's likeness to Jacob. As Solomon puts it, "Like Jacob, Prior wrestles with the Angel and seeks the blessing of more life. And, like Jacob, the struggle leaves him limping Most importantly, Prior takes on a new, collective identity by holding out against the Angel" (131). Miller figures him as a sort of gay revolutionary patriarch: "Prior is the Jacob who must wrestle with . . . the Angel her- self. Fortunately, his physical frailty is offset by a spiritual toughness reminiscent of the fighting spirit of the drag queens who kicked off the Stonewall Riots in 1969" (61-62).</page><page sequence="15">590* CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE He ends his most impassioned speech with this cynical evocation of the departed Divine, and the pause that surely sits between "what?" and "God" shows just how grounded Prior is in the mortal lot, in pain, in a desire to distance himself from an absentee creator who leaves when things get tough. Indeed, Prior's appropriation of J's blessing - "more life" - is a barb fired at heaven and a plea that Prior be allowed to stick around even when God will not. The Flaming Aleph: Sex and Monism in Angels The view of sex that Kushner provides in Angels also betrays the influence of Bloom and J. Kushner 's play is filled with sex; whether it be gay sex, straight sex, married sex, or unfaithful sex, Kushner injects heaven and earth with a dynamic libidinal energy. However, it is the eroticization of God and his heavenly court that is most likely to rile the conservative reader of Angels, for indeed they have sex too. As Prior explains it, sex is constitutive of God's relationship with the angels. The orgasmic energy - or, more bluntly, the "Spooj" - that their coupling produces powers the cre- ation and maintenance of the cosmos. Moreover, the erotic plays an important role in divine-human relations. Joe's vision of Jacob and the wrestling angel is undeniably erotic (and specifically homoerotic): "Jacob is young and very strong. The angel is ... a beautiful man, with golden hair and wings, of course. I still dream about it" (Millennium 49; ellipsis in original). Prior's first encounter with the Angel involves him humping the book of the angelic prophecy while the Angel climaxes. (In director Mike Nichols's film version of the play, Prior and the Angel actually copulate.) It seems as if, at least in Prior's case, sex serves as a nec- essary stage in a mystical quest. Further, before returning to heaven near the end of Perestroika, the Angel gives Joe's mother Hannah what one can only assume is her first orgasm in many years. For Kushner, sex and the flesh - human, angelic, or even godly - are undoubtedly divine. All of this erotic theological play is a very far cry from the Pauline dualistic mode that raises up the spirit only at the expense of the flesh (or, for that matter, the degradation of sex and sexuality in</page><page sequence="16">P E D E R S O N • 591 Augustine). Only the spirit is holy; the flesh - which becomes synecdoche for body and sexual activity - is an obstacle, a tempta- tion whose allures must be overcome if salvation is to be attained. As Paul writes, "Live by the Spirit, I say, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh. For what the flesh desires is opposed to the Spirit, and what the Spirit desires is opposed to the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, to prevent you from doing what you want" (Gal. 5:16-17). In Angels, such a negative valuation of the body is absent, and the distinction between flesh and spirit is immaterial. The Angel's description of herself takes up Paul's language - referring to the body as "flesh" - and confirms Kushner 's glorification of the car- nal and the corporeal: You are Mere Flesh. 1 1 1 1 am Utter Flesh, Density of Desire, the Gravity of Skin: What makes the Engine of Creation Run? Not Physics But Ecstatics Makes the Engine Run. (Perestroika 39) The Angel is humanity's own bodily nature rendered ultimate. Hence, contra Paul, Kushner seems to suggest that individual "spir- itual" progress requires not the destruction of the flesh but its fulfill- ment. It is almost as if what is required of us is not that we abstain from sex but perfect it, learn to do it correctly. Kushner 's depiction of God also serves as a tacit critique of Pauline dualism. Kushner describes God as "a flaming Hebrew letter, but a male flaming Hebrew letter" (Perestroika 49). 13 Paul as frequently distinguishes between the spirit and the flesh as he does between the spirit and "the letter," and famously suggests in 2 Corinthians that "the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life" (3:6). In his vision of God, Kushner elevates - nay, deifies - both the letter and the flesh, making his ver- sion of God a fiery aleph fully capable of satisfying the sexual needs of a countless host of hermaphroditic (and, candidly speaking, 13. David Savran wittily notes the (homo)sexual figuration of Kushner 's God: "After his visitation by the Angel, Prior explains that 'God ... is a man. Well, not a man, he's a flaming Hebrew letter, but a male flaming Hebrew letter.' In comparison with this masculinized, Old Testament-style, 'flaming' (!) patriarch, the Angels are decidedly hermaphroditic" (22-23).</page><page sequence="17">592 • CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE randy) angels. Thus does God destroy the imaginary distinctions that exist among flesh, letter, and spirit.14 Such distinctions are similarly lost on J. In fact, Bloom attributes to the J writer the seminal development of monism, the theological opposite of Paul's dualism: "A monistic vitalism that refuses to dis- tinguish between flesh and spirit is at the center of J's vision, which is thus at the opposite extreme from either the Gnostic or the Pauline Christian dualism" (/ 277). Bloom goes so far as to suggest that J invents monism - a theological and anthropological system based not on distinctions and binaries but on unity and wholeness. For Bloom, only the priestly writer (P, in the shorthand of Biblical scholarship) and later redactors are interested in degrading the flesh; J accepts it and glories in it, acknowledging the integral role the body plays in human progress. Indeed, if Saint Augustine sug- gests that sex is the sin that led to Adam's (and Eve's) Fall, for J, there is no fall, because "for J there is nothing fallen about nature, earthly or human" (Bloom, Book 176). The same can be said of Kushner's Angels, in which sex is not that which drives us from God, but instead that which makes us more like him. Making Law in a Lawless Land: Roy Cohn as Jacob Modern Judaism is most simply identified as the religion of the Law. When the Jewish temple in Jerusalem - the physical and spiri- tual center of Judaism - was destroyed by the Romans in 70 ce (never to be rebuilt), Judaism lost its core and largely transformed itself from a religion of ritual sacrifice to a religion of the Book. For Jews ever since, the Book is the Torah, and the Torah is the Law. 14. Kushner's language - and more specifically, the status of the word itself in Angels in America - may reflect Bloom's influence. In The Book of], Bloom cites Ephraim Urbach's understanding of J's "words": "When Urbach explains that the word for 'word' stands also for 'substance' or 'thing/ we are very much in J's sense of the truth, for 'the Hebrew tongue' here actually means J" {Book 276). Bloom seems to join Urbach in placing J in a moment before the development of a semiotic distinction between symbol and referent - Derrida's différance. For J, at least in Bloom's conception, the fact that "word" and "thing" are one and the same points to a primal identity of symbol and referent. Such is certainly the case with Kushner's God, the flaming aleph who is both letter (word) and thing, signi- fier and referent.</page><page sequence="18">PEDERSON • 593 In the absence of the Temple, Rabbinic Jews rebuilt their religion from text, and from a textual reverence of the Jewish Law as found in the Torah. However, the archaic Judaism of pre-Davidic Israel was not a legalistic religion; in fact, rigid adherence to Law is anathema to J's Yahweh and his children. In J's narrative, though there is mention of the production of the Commandments at Sinai, it is greatly truncated. In fact, J's recitation of the commandments - and for her, there are fewer than ten - is delightfully beside the point; it pales in comparison to the drama of the theophany that precedes it. Additionally, within the commandments themselves, Bloom suggests that "J's emphasis is much more pragmatic than ethical" (Book 260). Therefore, the notion of sin - at least insofar as one might define it as transgression of the Law - is irrelevant to J's religious universe. Indeed, those who "sin" in J merely fail to attain the same kind of vital dynamism that Yahweh embodies. And if there is no sin in J, then there is also no judgment - evaluation before the strictures of the Law (though there certainly is punish- ment). Yahweh and his fortunate sons (and daughters) all interact on the same level, and neither he nor his offspring may serve as fit judge for the other. Kushner's, too, is just such an amoral (though not necessarily immoral) fictional realm. And his "Law" - or lack thereof - also shows the influence of J. Though Louis and Joe, both employees of the local district court, occasionally pontificate on the nature of the Law, it is Roy Cohn who best expatiates upon its Bloomian aspects in Angels. For Roy, one does not follow the law or prostrate oneself before it. One uses it, subverts it, transcends it, and remakes it in one's own image. As Roy puts it: "You want to be Nice, or you want to be Effective? Make the law, or subject to it" (Millennium 108). (Roy overreaches in "making" the law; shortly before his death, he is dis- barred for ethical breaches.) Law, sin, and judgment are, for Roy and J, paper tigers. There is no Law; there is only God, that breathlessly dynamic, ever-changing imp-of-a-deity. Compare, for instance, such a description of God with Roy's understanding of the Law: "I don't see the Law as a dead and arbitrary collection of antiquated dictums, thou shall, thou shalt not, because, because I know the Law's a pliable, breathing, sweating . . . organ" (Millennium 66; ellip- sis in original).</page><page sequence="19">594 »CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE All this is not to suggest that for Roy and J there is no standard for correct behavior. A man is successful (and J and Roy both measure strength in terms of success, not morality) insofar as he is a good son - insofar as he receives, or occasionally steals, a blessing from his father. In a scene markedly similar to Isaac's blessing of Jacob in Genesis 27, Roy blesses Joe shortly before his death. Earlier in the play, Roy lists the many fathers from whom he wrested his own blessing: The most precious asset in life, I think, is the ability to be a good son. You have that, Joe. Somebody who can be a good son to a father who pushes them farther than they would otherwise go. I've had many fathers, I owe my life to them, powerful, powerful men. Walter Winchell, Edgar Hoover. Joe McCarthy most of all. He valued me because I am a good lawyer, but he loved me because I was and am a good son. (Millennium 56) For J as for Roy, the blessing is a generational gift passed on, if not by blood, at least by a metaphorical lineage. Shortly before blessing Joe, Roy makes explicit reference to Jacob, that "heel-grabber" who, more than any of J's other characters, validates relentless and occa- sionally unscrupulous pursuit of the blessing. As Roy describes him, Jacob is "[a] ruthless motherfucker, some bald runt, but he laid hold of his birthright with his claws and his teeth" (Perestroika 81). From this description, it is clear that Roy shares Bloom's unortho- dox understanding of Jacob. As Bloom and others point out, J's Jacob does not succeed because he follows a law; instead, he thrives because of his single-minded, grasping pursuit of his goals and, often, by the subversion of widely accepted customs and tradi- tions. Such a description also applies to Roy. In fact, even more than the always sympathetic Prior or the weak, indecisive Joe, Roy stands in as Kushner's resident Jacob, indefatigable and sometimes despicable in the pursuit of blessing. In the Bloomian zone of Kushner's play, heroes may distinguish themselves by passionate action, by dynamic transformation that heeds no legalistic require- ments. Roy, though sometimes repulsive, remains an unrelenting antihero, a protagonist who is seldom nice but frequently effective.15 15. It should be understood that, in likening Roy to Jacob, I do not wish to suggest that Roy is somehow redeemed. The Torah narrative, taken as a whole, smoothes</page><page sequence="20">PEDERSON * 595 Perhaps it is this relentlessness, this dynamic drive, that draws Belize - serving as Roy's nurse - to this "ruthless motherfucker" that he should detest. How else can one explain why Belize urges Roy to use his connections to acquire a stash of a new anti-AIDS drug (AZT, still in experimental trials), or why he demands that a Kaddish be spoken over the man's corpse? In Millennium Approaches, Joe apprehensively dreams about the abolition of the Law: Maybe the court won't convene. Ever again. Maybe we are free. To do whatever. Children of the new morning, criminal minds. Selfish and greedy and loveless and blind. Reagan's children. You're scared. So am I. Everybody is in the land of the free. God help us all. (Millennium 74) However, evidence suggests that in Kushner, the Law has already been abolished, and that only the weak still cling to antiquated notions of it. If, as in J, the Law is irrelevant in Angels in America, then all the play's residents live in a state of vertiginous freedom. And perhaps the only character who is bold enough - or brutal enough - to act on that freedom is Roy, Kushner 's own despicable heel-grabber.16 Of course, freedom from the Law is not the only type of freedom, and there are those who may compellingly argue that in Kushner 's "Gay Fantasia," the closeted Roy is anything but "free." Jonathan Freedman, for one, calls the historical Cohn "spectacularly self-denying" (93). But at least according to Roy's own understanding of sexual identity, sexual dis- tinctions disintegrate under the solvent force of individual power, or "clout." As Roy explains to his doctor, Henry: over some of Jacob's rough edges; in J's tale, by contrast, Jacob is relentless, immoral, brutal, and frankly unlikable - he is the most unexpected of Yahweh's chosen. Therefore, Kushner can see Jacob in Roy without depicting the latter as anything other than morally reprehensible. It should be noted that the characters most closely associ- ated with the Law and legal institutions - Roy, Joe, and Louis - are ethically dubious characters. 16. This understanding of Roy may at least partially counteract Jonathan Freedman's description of him as a nexus of negative Jewish (and queer) stereotypes. To characterize Roy in terms of an (unironic) reflection of one of the Jewish patriarchs is to suggest a more positive connection with Jewish tradition, if an "archaic'' one.</page><page sequence="21">596 -CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE [Y]ou are hung up on words, on labels aids. Homosexual. Gay. Lesbian. You think these are names that tell you who someone sleeps with, but they don't [T]hey tell you one thing and one thing only: where does an individual so identified fit in the food chain, in the pecking order? Not ideology, or sexual taste, but something much simpler: clout. {Millennium 45) Though the real Roy Cohn may have suffered for his sexual self- denial, Kushner's Roy never does. Further, even aids cannot fully eradicate the stubborn Roy. Cohn survives Kushner's multiple efforts to kill him off; Freedman counts four death scenes for Roy and cites Kushner's "profound fascination with this character" as one of the reasons for his persistence (96). After these assassination attempts, a hell-bound Roy is still practicing his profession, gearing up for a legal defense of God. Just as J's Yahweh blesses Jacob, so does Kushner reward Roy's dogged obstinance, granting him a fiery immortality despite his many crimes. From Theology to Anthropology Likely by design, these five pieces borrowed from Bloom - Yahweh, Jacob, the blessing, sex, the Law - never coalesce into a discernible theology. That is to say, they remain an array of discrete effects that enliven Kushner's text without imposing a new religious order upon it. However, that they do so remains a direct effect of Bloom's influence. For as the critic repeatedly argues, J "is an author who tells stories, and not a theologian" (Book 301). Her Yahweh possesses a "restless dynamism [that] will not consent to be confined" (291), and she defines him in terms of the incommensurate and the inas- similable. Hence to make of Yahweh a field of study - to identify his theology - is impossible; it is to systematize and institutionalize him out of existence. Moreover, it is unlikely that Kushner would have allowed a theologized, theologizing vision into his most significant play. In a 2005 New Yorker feature, John Lahr recounts an episode during which, "in a debate sponsored by the Classic Stage Company, one of Kushner's great champions, the critic Harold Bloom, spent the better part of two hours trying in vain to get Kushner to admit that he was a theological writer" (42). Had Bloom remembered his own work in the Book of], perhaps he would have</page><page sequence="22">PEDERSON * 597 given up this vain effort. For Kushner - like Bloom - is not a theo- logical writer at all, at least insofar as theologizing tends to involve imposing regulations upon the vital dynamism of the divine.17 Kushner 's God - as with J's and Bloom's - will not be confined; in fact, he will walk off the stage and never return if he sees fit. But ultimately, for Kushner, God is not the point. In all of his sundry borrowings from J's religious vision, Kushner never lets his gaze stray too far from his very earthly characters. His musings on the nature of a vital, incommensurate divine (and the mythological ramifications of these musings) do not obscure Kushner 's basic humanism. Thus Kushner leaves his reader at the end of Perestroika not with some Dantean revelation of his idiosyncratic God but with a utopie vision of human community. Indeed, Kushner rs channeling of J only enhances his humanism. After all, if Bloom calls J's "exalta- tion of men and women" unique in the ancient world (Book 275), in Angels, Kushner revels in this exaltation. Both J and Kushner lift humanity up while at the same time endowing it with an attractive power that pulls God and his heavens down (recall God's "Mortifying imitation" of humanity in Perestroika). From J, Kushner learns that God looks (and wants to look) like humans; he learns that earthly life, and more of it, is a divine blessing; he learns that the flesh is sacred; and he learns that one is free to explore the earth unrestrained by divine Law. In sum, he learns that to be human is to be holy, and very nearly divine. For as Bloom reminds us, "Man" is one of the "ancient rabbinical names for God" (Book 292).
