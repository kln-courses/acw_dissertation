Rynes, University of Iowa Eric Barends, Center for Evidence-Based Management Denise M. Rousseau, Carnegie Mellon University "Strengthening the teaching-research nexus holds vast potential to deliver not only the skills needed to understand research to generations of upcoming managers, but also to instill values that recognize the validity of research." —(Burke &amp; Rau. 2010: 132) "The absence of a critical mass of evi dence-based managers today trans lates into both poorer outcomes for or ganizations and into pressures to conform to more ad hoc approaches. An entire generation of evidence-based managers may be needed before orga nizations make wide use of scientific evidence in their decisions." —(Rousseau &amp; McCarthy, 2007: 99) "If you aren't evidence-based, what are you?" —(Rob Briner) That managers rarely use research findings in making organizational decisions has been well-established (Abrahamson &amp; Eisenman, 2001; Johns, 1993). The fre quent discrepancies between organizational practices and what would be suggested by the best available scientific evidence are widely seen as a major cause of poor decision making, lost productivity, faddishness, employee cynicism, and public distrust (Abrahamson, 1991; Pfeffer &amp; Sutton, 2006; Rousseau, 2006). Moreover, the failure of managers to make decisions based on a common, systematic body of knowledge is widely re garded as a major impediment to professionalism of the field of management (e.g., Trank &amp; Rynes, 2003). In addition to the costs of poorly informed manage ment decisions, managers' failure to use research find ings poses a threat to academics. Despite arguments that research is the central competitive advantage of business schools (Hitt, 1998), the public remains uncon vinced. In fact, declining financial support for universi ties (including business schools) is often justified pre cisely on grounds of the perceived limited usefulness of academic research and the "excessive" time spent by academics on research as opposed to teaching. The fact that most managers do not view academic research as an important input to their decisions means that con sultants and corporate universities are generally seen as preferable to business schools as sources of infor mation, and more attention is focused on what others are doing (often euphemized as "best practices") rather than "what works" (Abrahamson &amp; Eisenman, 2001; Bansal et al„ 2012; McGrath, 2007). One reason that managers might not look to research when making decisions is that some managers have no formal education in management. Moreover, even those who have earned either BBAs or MBAs may have lim ited exposure to management research findings, or to education about how to access, read, interpret, and critically appraise research studies (Burke &amp; Rau, 2010; Rousseau &amp; McCarthy, 2007). For example, a review of more than 800 syllabi from required management courses in American MBA programs revealed that only 25% contained keywords or phrases suggesting that course content and delivery incorporated the teaching of research-based concepts and principles (Charlier, Brown, &amp; Rynes, 2011). The purpose of this special issue will be to explore the teaching of evidence-based management (EBMgt), that is, the conscientious use of the best available evi dence, including findings from scientific research, in managerial decision making. In the following subsec tions, we offer greater detail about the types of topics we would expect and the types of submissions that would compose the issue. These guidelines are gener ally consistent with the typical composition of a regular AMLE issue. POSSIBLE TOPICS FOR SUBMISSIONS Below is a list of possible research questions, issues, and topics that submissions might address. We also encourage other types of work that address important issues associated with teaching EBMgt in ways other than those specifically described here. Conceptual Issues: • A basic principle underlying all evidence-based practice is that a solid body of reliable and valid research evi dence must exist. To what extent is such a body of</page><page sequence="6">evidence available in the various subfields of manage ment? What are the implications of differences in the amount or quality of evidence for the multiple types of decisions that managers must make? • Does EBMgt need to be tailored to different content ar eas, student populations, or geographical regions? If so, how and why? • The EBMgt movement has been modeled to some extent on the 20-year-old EBMedicine movement. To what ex tent is generalization from EBMed to EBMgt appropriate or inappropriate? • What is the role of the instructor in teaching EBMgt? Are there personal attributes that make for more or less effective EBMgt instructors (e.g., research record, person ality characteristics, managerial experience)? • To what extent (and how) can individuals develop an ability and orientation toward using evidence in making decisions? How can students best be trained in the crit ical thinking central to evidence-based practice? • Should evidence from qualitative management research be used in teaching EBMgt? If so, how should teachers and students evaluate the quality of qualitative evidence? Practice Issues: • What range of practices currently exists under the rubric of "Teaching Evidence-Based Management"? To what extent are practices consistent with those recommended by Rousseau &amp; McCarthy (2007)? • How many EBMgt courses are taught in business pro grams today? What is the ratio of required to elective courses? What strategies and tactics have been used in getting EBMgt courses into the curriculum? • To what extent do courses in data analysis, research methods, or statistics (as distinct from courses in orga nizational behavior, strategy, or human resource management) embed evidence-based management prin ciples in their design and delivery? What are the pros and cons of using methods-related courses, rather than content courses such as OB or Strategy, to teach EBMgt? • What techniques inside and outside the classroom are most effective in developing evidence-based thinkers? • What is the role of textbooks in the framing of manage ment as evidence-based? What are the responsibilities of authors, adopters, and publishers in assuring content is based on the best available evidence? • To what extent are current EBMgt teaching methods con sistent with Goodman &amp; O'Brien's (2012) chapter on prin ciples of evidence-based teaching (of any subject)? • What methods are most successful in (a) giving students the skills and confidence to try to persuade others to use research evidence, and (b) persuading effectively? • One challenge in teaching EBMgt is that research evi dence will sometimes conflict with students' existing beliefs, thus creating the potential for negative or defen sive reactions to new information. How can negative initial reactions be turned into positive learning experi ences? • Another challenge in teaching EBMgt is that many stu dents are not very comfortable with math, statistics, and research methods. What are the best methods for ad dressing this issue in the context of EBMgt? Outcomes: • What are the outcomes desired from teaching EBMgt? Is it knowledge of the best available research evidence on a course's topics? Is it the stimulation of life-long learn ing skills, including how to find and critically appraise scientific research and other evidence? Or is it develop ing students' identities as "evidence-based" practition ers and citizens? • How can the impact of teaching EBMgt be evaluated? What techniques and instruments are available for eval uating changes in attitudes, skills, and behaviors as a result of EBMgt instruction? Initial submissions should be received by June 30, 2013, and should adhere to the "Style and Format" guide for authors that can be found at http://aom.org/amle. Man uscripts should be submitted at http://mc.manuscript central.com/amle, and designated under Manuscript Type as "Special Issue: Teaching Evidence-Based Man agement." Presubmission discussion of and consulta tion on potential submission ideas and topics are wel comed and encouraged. For further information, please contact the lead guest editor, Sara Rynes, at sara rvnes@uiowa.edu. All submissions will be subject to a rigorous, double blind peer-review process, with one or more guest edi tors acting as action editor, and final approval coming from the journal editor. Invitations to revise and resub mit will follow initial submissions in approximately 2 months, with a final deadline of April 30, 2014 for ac cepted submissions. REFERENCES Abrahamson, E. 1991.

For some time institutional researchers have recognized the importance of lan guage, discourse, and communication in the very processes that constitute institutions. Yet while communication is clearly central to the construction of institutions and their logics, we are still lacking theories about the microprocesses through which catego ries, logics, practices, genres, or identities come into being in everyday interaction. In turn, in communication research, broadly defined, researchers have developed a num ber of theories and methods with the poten tial to elucidate precisely such processes and the interactions between the micro and macro levels. Yet, to date, institutional the ory has not been infused with these insights. The purpose of this special topic forum is to bring together these two strains of re search—cognition and communication—to advance our understanding of the crucial role of communication in institutionaliza tion. This involves bringing insights from various theories of social cognition, sense making, discourse analysis, and other cog nitive and communication-related perspec tives to institutional theory. In particular, we believe it is necessary to focus attention on the microlinkages among communication, cognition, and institutions in and around or ganizations. Such analysis should not merely focus on management, professions, and organizations per se but should link those to wider national and global institu tional structures and processes, such as markets and emerging or declining econo mies. With this call for papers we therefore seek to expand communication and cognitive per spectives on institutions and institutional ization by encouraging scholars to • examine the cognitive, communicative, and social bases of institutions and in stitutional change; • seek or develop models that incorporate or make use of cognitive and communi cation theories and concepts, such as voice, frames, rhetoric, dialogue, dis course, interaction, speech acts, and in stitutional messages, events, orders, or memory; • theorize how communication affects the dualities of institutional maintenance and change, conformity and deviance; and • explore the connection between the mi cro worlds of organizational communi cation and sensemaking, cognition, and the taken-for-grantedness of institu tions. A key focus of papers submitted should be recognition of the interpersonal and interor ganizational acts of communication that maintain and transform local, national, and global institutions. The concepts employed may include but are not limited to audience analysis, studies of cognitive categories, discourse analysis, frame analysis, genres, message construction, narratives, proto types, and sensemaking, among others. Accordingly, we invite contributions that include the following potential approaches:</page><page sequence="9">• A focus on communication processes that sustain or transform institutions. For example, communication and insti tutions may be viewed as conformity regimes such that institutional confor mity or deviance is seen as a speech act. Alternatively, researchers could theorize the role of the media in institu tionalization and change, specifying the link between microinteractions and microstructure. • Similarly, a formulation of the ways in which institutional messages have con sequences for organizations or a model of the ways that legitimacy and legiti mization are communicative processes. • A focus on the contributions of category, frame, genre, and other cognitive con structs and processes to the study of institutions. For example, a potential paper could tie communication and cognition to institutions through speci fying the role of social media in trans mitting institutional logics and frames. • A focus on the roles of governments, markets, and NGOs as national and in ternational carriers of institutions and institutional logics. For example, re searchers could demonstrate the role of professional and trade associations or consultants as communication media in structuring industries internationally, or they could theorize the role(s) of in ternational institutions in the accept ability of institutional logics.

It is generally accepted now that "history matters." Partly, this is due to the ascendancy of theoretical perspectives that take history seriously, such as new in stitutionalism and the resource-based view of the firm. There is also increasing recogni tion that history is a vital component in mak ing the study of business and management more ethical, humanistic, and managerially relevant (e.g., Jacques, 1996). Even so, the questions raised by Zald (1993) and Kieser (1994) remain relevant, such as "How can historical description enrich theory develop ment?" or "How and why should historical analysis be conducted?" Usdiken and Kieser (2004) extended these questions to consider whether organization theory can simply in corporate history as a variable or whether a historical reorientation, or historic turn, is required. This call for papers explores the power of history for advancing organization studies, both for a fuller understanding of contempo rary developments in organizations and or ganization theory and for an appreciation of parallels in the discipline of history. History has a double meaning. It refers to the past itself, as well as knowledge and narratives of the past. We cannot simply say that the past matters without also considering what historians have to say about the past or how our knowledge of the past is constructed. This call for papers therefore seeks to ex pand on these themes by encouraging schol arship to • examine how concepts derived from history (such as ideal types or invented traditions) can be applied to the study of management and organizations, • revisit theories of management and or ganization in relation to history and questions arising from historiography (as a body of historical work in a partic ular field, as well as the theory and methods of history as a discipline), and • propose and evaluate new conceptual frameworks for understanding manage ment and organizations in a historical context. In so doing, this special topic forum pur sues the creative possibilities of historical work for organization studies and its sub fields. It does not necessarily ask organiza tional scholars to adopt the techniques of professional historians, although this could be one result. Rather, it asks organizational researchers to consider how they can inte grate historical values of contextualization, interpretation, and process to enhance the explanatory power of theory where dynamic and interdependent processes are con cerned, and where our oft-used empirical methods appear to produce diminishing re turns. These values add scope and depth to constructs from natural science, such as the cause-effect relationship, the analysis of de pendent and independent variables, and no mothetic theory. They also guard against overgeneralization, reductionism, and fad dishness and the general drift toward tech nicism ("problems without purpose"; Zald, 1991: 177). Debates about the nature of organization in the present and future need to be under stood in relation to the historical analysis of organization and the difficulty of discerning a clear trajectory in the past. Historical re search offers the potential for continually</page><page sequence="11">challenging management and organization theory by undermining any notion that the past is fixed and can be taken as given. Consider, for example, how research contex tualizing the Hawthorne studies has chal lenged our understanding of how manage ment thought, and organization theory itself, developed in relation to academic and cor porate agendas during the New Deal (O'Connor, 1999). It is important to note, however, that this call for papers is not soliciting historical illustrations that simply reinforce accepted theories of organization—we are not looking for propositions that reduce history to a tem poral variable. Rather, we are seeking theo retical contributions that engage with his tory, either through the examination or application of concepts derived from history in relation to organizations (historical theo ries of organization) or through consider ation of how theories of organization can illuminate history (organizational theories of history). We also envisage consideration of whether history represents a challenge to the conceptualization of what constitutes theory in the study of organizations, as well as the relevance of the theory and philoso phy of history. Concepts that could be con sidered might include (but are not limited to) the following: • Path dependence tends to hold context constant, with clearly identifiable turn ing points where lock-in begins, whereas historians tend to see history as being in constant flux, or as "chaostory" (Fer guson, 1997). • Dynamic capabilities and the notion of being able to do things over time, as well as in time, provide another poten tial area of study. A historical view can help us define what may be "dynamic in capabilities beyond a simplistic tempo ral dimension." For example, how does the contextual setting and how do inter pretations by managers or leaders in fluence how dynamic some capabilities become? • Organizational memory is part of the rise of memory studies across a range of disciplines, including history. Historical concepts of invented tradition and imagined communities challenge our notion that organizations bear an im print from their founding, suggesting that these imprints are more often con structed retrospectively. As a historical concept, realms of memory emphasize the importance of historical sites and practices that represent the past in the present. • The new institutionalism has been chal lenged for losing the historical orienta tion of "old" institutionalism. To what extent are contemporary concepts, such as those dealing with institutional log ics, categories, eras, or entrepreneurs, adequate to describe profound histori cal transitions affecting organizations? To what extent must these concepts be supplemented by ideas from the histor ical and "old" institutionalism regard ing power, ideology, values, and func tions? • People in history provide a rich source of analogies for contemporary concepts. For example, classical Greek texts, such as Xenophon's Anabasis, are widely used in discussions of leader ship and culture. For organizational be havior the role of historical parallels could be considered. • In addition to our concern with history in management and organization the ory, contributors might also consider the status of organization theory in neighboring fields of history—obvi ously, business history, but also social and economic history more broadly, as well as cultural and intellectual history. Organization theorists and historians alike need to question the epistemolog ical status of historical narratives, which in business and management are typically regarded as prosaic storytell ing, with the implication that critical, skeptical faculties can be relaxed.

Because it puts society's resources to their most efficient uses, a ver sion of market capitalism that approximates microeconomic models of perfect competi tion—that is, competition based on price, a laissez-faire approach to governmental in volvement in the economy, and a profit (or shareholder wealth) maximization objective for firms—is thought to produce high levels of societal welfare. Throughout much of U.S. history, economic scarcity was a pressing social problem and this approach was de fensible, despite the social welfare prob lems created in its wake. However, now that material abundance better describes aggre gate economic outcomes, social welfare problems, new and ongoing, are less easily dismissed. Some of these problems have emerged with a vengeance—for example, scandals involving enormous sums of money, increasing inequality of wealth and income, high levels of unemployment that may not be temporary, homelessness among former members of the middle class as well as the chronically poor, soaring health care costs, and a political system apparently be holden to the vested interests of corpora tions and wealthy individuals. Thus, al though the U.S. economic system has an enviable record of making its citizens collec tively richer, it no longer seems capable of addressing some other urgent social welfare problems that have emerged from the rela tionships between the economy and the rest of society. Nonetheless, although the Academy of Management's vision is quite noble—"We inspire and enable a better world through our scholarship and teaching about man agement and organizations"—the manage ment literature has been remarkably quiet about the roles of managers and corpora tions in first creating and then solving these problems. Indeed, little appears to have changed since Walsh, Weber, and Margolis lamented an "eerie silence" in the manage ment literature with respect to issues of hu man welfare at the societal level and urged management scholars to "bring social wel fare back in" to their research agendas— most important, by integrating social and economic objectives (2003: 860; 875). This spe cial topic forum is intended to help fill this void in the literature by encouraging theo retical work that addresses important social welfare issues related to the activities of large corporations in the economy and those who manage them. We recognize that some theories address ing topics as broad as "management theory and social welfare" may tend to be novel, integrative, relatively abstract, and, there fore, difficult to present in fully developed form in the space normally allotted to jour nal articles. Since we also believe that im portant developments on this subject ought to appear in a "high-impact" management journal with a social welfare vision, AMR seems to be an ideal forum for beginning a dialogue on the topic. Therefore, in the re view process for this special topic forum, we will require scholarly depth in inverse pro portion to the breadth and level of integra tion required to convey the basic concepts of the theory and in inverse proportion to the importance of the social welfare issue the</page><page sequence="14">theory addresses. Theories depending on reasonable changes in existing institutions and those based on values other than those that underpin existing theory will be consid ered as well. Examples of management issues with clear social welfare implications that could be ad dressed in this STF include the following: • How can we better deal with economic externalities in our pursuit of greater profitability at the firm level? Is eco nomic wealth actually created when shareholder wealth increases are achieved at the expense of other corpo rate constituents? • Is competition based on price really the best means of promoting social welfare? Must consumers always be presented with "everyday low prices," even if such pricing results in substantial sacrifices on the part of other corporate stakehold ers—for example, employees or suppli ers? • Are market solutions to social welfare problems always superior to govern mental solutions or private/public part nerships? If allocating resources ac cording to the price system means providing goods and services to citizens in proportion to their ability to pay, might some products and services be better provided by other means, and, if so, what role might managers play in this alternative distribution system? • Is free trade within global markets re ally optimal for the welfare of society? The globalization of commerce has been a windfall for consumers, but are measures needed to mitigate declines in the welfare of other corporate constit uents, employees in particular? • Are increasingly unequal distributions of wealth and income in the U.S. econ omy beneficial to social welfare? Is eco nomic growth sustainable if the buying power of large groups in society contin ues to decrease? • Are there worthy alternatives to the the ories on which current management practices and institutional arrange ments are based? For example: -Is shareholder wealth maximization re ally the best way to optimize social welfare? -Is the pursuit of competitive advan tage, which implies value creation at the firm level, always compatible with wealth creation at the societal level? -Have applications of agency theory led to improvements in social welfare? Or can theories based on less pessimistic assumptions about human behavior— that is, other than opportunism—help us develop theory better able to ad vance social welfare? • How can organization-level policies and management practices be altered to improve the welfare of society? Since managers are central actors in promot ing the larger good of society, what kinds of "bottom-up" organizational practices can serve to advance societal welfare? In summary, we invite manuscripts that (a) address major social/economic problems related to the practice of management and/or the activities of economic institu tions, notably including large corporations, or (b) point to new ways to improve social welfare through the economic system. Sub mitted manuscripts could differ from more conventional journal articles by (1) challeng ing received wisdom, (2) relaxing the as sumptions that underpin existing theories in order to make them more realistic, and (3) explicitly addressing values and their ef fects on existing theory.

Information for Contributors: Editorial Policies and Style Guidelines MISSION The Academy of Management Learning &amp; Educa tion (AMLE) advances the knowledge and practice of management learning and education. It does so by publishing theoretical models and reviews, qualitative and quantitative research, critique, ex changes, and retrospectives on any substantive topic that is conceived with, and draws implica tions for, how managers learn and the educational process and context. An interdisciplinary journal, AMLE broadly defines its constituents to include scholars, educators, program directors, deans, and other administrators at academic institutions, as well as consultants, policy makers and practitio ners in private or public organizations in which management learning and education are of central concern. DESCRIPTION OF JOURNAL SECTIONS AMLE publishes a wide range of materials devoted to management education in colleges and univer sities, and indeed, in all organizations that for mally foster learning about management, in four sections: Research &amp; Reviews We seek a variety of articles, including quantita tive and qualitative empirical manuscripts, theo retical discourses and models, literature reviews, and general or specific appraisals of approaches to individual learning and management educa tion. Authors of submissions for this section are encouraged to consider relevant theoretical per spectives when developing their manuscripts. To be accepted, manuscripts are expected to make a contribution, theoretical or otherwise, to the study and practice of management learning and educa tion. In empirical submissions, we require authors to report effect sizes alongside any statistical tests. There are two major classes of effect sizes.. The first involves standardized mean differences, most often used to report results of experiments. Effect sizes in this class include indices such as Glass' Δ, Hedges' g, and Cohen's d. The second class of effect sizes are variance-accounted-for measures, which can be computed in both experimental and nonexperimental studies. Such effect sizes include i2, fl2, and η2. Although there is no formal page limit, manu scripts submitted for this section are typically be tween 20 and 40 pages. As always, length should reflect the value of the contribution. Submissions should follow the SUBMISSION PROCESS guide lines below, and prospective authors are welcome to contact the editor as detailed below: Kenneth G.

Please do not sub mit uninvited manuscripts for this section. How ever, we encourage you to send suggestions of individuals who have made significant contribu tions to scholarship and practice in learning and management education. Even though manuscripts in this section are in vited, they still undergo rigorous blind review. Jean Bartunek Boston College bartunek@bc.edu Essays, Dialogues, &amp; Interviews We are interested in a wide variety of provocative manuscripts on current and future issues and trends in teaching, learning, and management ed ucation for this section of the journal. Essays are original commentaries or critiques. Narrative accounts of author experiences with spe cific instructional technologies, techniques, courses, or program creation are not essays. Dia logues are responses to papers previously pub lished in AMLE. Interviews are discussions with academics, educators, and business or thought leaders that would be of interest to our readership. Submissions should follow the SUBMISSION IN FORMATION guidelines below, and prospective Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved. Contents may not be copied, emailed, posted to a listserv, or otherwise transmitted without the copyright holder's express written permission. Users may print, download or email articles for individual use only.</page><page sequence="20">Academy οί Management Learning &amp; Education December authors are welcome to discuss ideas with the associate editor listed below. Dialogues are rooted in Exemplary Contribu tions, Research &amp; Reviews, or Essays published in AMLE, and should broadly advance the state of scholarship in the area of the target paper as op posed to being primarily critiques of the reasoning or methodology of the target paper. Authors of the target paper will not normally be allowed to re spond to a Dialogue, except when the editor and relevant associate editors deem that such a re sponse could add significant value. In such in stances, every effort will be made to print the Di alogue and the response from the author contiguously. Interviews capture question-and-answer ex changes with a person (or persons) of interest to our readers. Published interviews include much more than just the exchange; they are framed with regard to issues important to our readers and often include a discussion section. Before developing an interview-type manuscript, prospective authors are strongly encouraged to examine prior inter view papers and consult with the section editor to ensure that the topic and approach is consistent with AMLE's mission and audience. Carolyn P. Egri Simon Fraser University egri@sfu.ca Book 8? Resource Reviews AMLE publishes reviews relevant to management learning and education (books, videos, simula tions, exercises, etc.), which are designated and coordinated by the associate editor listed below. We welcome reviews of materials that can be used by management educators, practitioners, and re searchers, and are particularly interested in re views of resources drawn from across the disci plines. Unsolicited reviews will not be accepted. We encourage readers interested in writing re views and those who have suggestions of materi als for review to contact: Amy L. Kenworthy Bond University akenwort@bond.edu.au REVIEW PROCESS The editor will screen all submitted manuscripts. In some cases, a manuscript may be returned with out review if it is judged to be inappropriate for publication in AMLE. Manuscripts that are egre giously deficient in grammar, spelling, and punc tuation may also be returned without review. Man uscripts judged to be consistent with the mission and standards otAMLE will be submitted for double blind review to at least two referees as dictated by content—at least one referee is always an editorial board member. Corresponding authors can expect to receive first-round feedback in approximately 75 days, moderated by the editor or an associate ed itor. STYLE AND FORMAT Overall Format Please use the 8 1/2x11 page setting, leaving top and side margins of one inch and placing page numbers in the upper-right corner of each page. Use Times New Roman 12-point type, double spaced, throughout the manuscript (including ab stract, text, footnotes, appendixes and references). While AMLE does not have a formal word limit, submissions typically range from 25 to 35 pages and rarely exceed 40 pages of text. Manuscripts too short or too long relative to their contribution will not be reviewed. Writing Style AMLE seeks well-argued and well-written manu scripts that our audience will want to read and remember. Toward that end we recommend the approach to writing presented in George D. Gopen and Judith A. Swan's (1990) "The Science of Scien tific Writing" (American Scientist, 78: 550-558) and Joseph M. William and Gregory G.

MANAGEMENT SCHOLAR Current University School and/or Department</page><page sequence="21">2012 Street Address City, State, Zip/Postal Code, Country Tel: (000) 000-0000 Fax: (000) 000-0000 E-mail: &lt;mditscholar@univ.edu Acknowledgments Ii you received financial support or other assis tance, you should acknowledge it in a note at the bottom of your title page. Abstract The first page of the manuscript for review, num bered page 1, must include only the article's title, and an abstract of no more than 200 words. Footnotes Minimize the use of footnotes for parenthetical dis cussion. Material tangential to the article's argu ment should simply not be included. Material es sential to the argument should be integrated into the text. Place footnotes at the bottom of their re spective pages. Footnotes should not be used for citing references (see References, below). Back Pages Please group references and any appendixes, ta bles, and figures at the end of the manuscript, in this order. Continue your page numbering. Headings and Sections AMLE uses four levels of headings. Use bold-face for all four. Main headings (all capital letters; cen tered) are first. Second-level headings (title-style letters; flush left) are next. Third-level headings are next. Fourth-level headings (first letter of first word capitalized; indented; italicized; and run into para graph). Initial headings, such as Introduction, are unnecessary. Don't skip steps: no second-level headings before you use a first-level heading, for instance. Use second- and third-level headings in sets of two or more. Examples: METHODS Research Context and Sample Data Collection Data Details Method Details Semi-structured interviews. Group observation. Hypotheses Fully and separately state each hypothesis you tested. Phrase it in the present tense. Give it a distinct number (Hypothesis 1) or number-letter (Hypothesis la) label. Set hypotheses off in in dented blocks, in italic type. Examples: Hypothesis la: Concise writing has a positive relationship to publication. Hypothesis lb: Following AMLE's "Style Guide for Authors" has a positive relationship to publica tion. Language Make every effort to make your writing accessible to AMLE's broad readership. Clear, concise, direct expression will maximize the impact of your work. Technical Terms Define key technical terms. A technical term is a word or phrase that is not in a general-use diction ary with the meaning you (or even you and other published scholars) ascribe to it. Abbreviations Avoid using abbreviations for the names of con cepts. Use ordinary words for variable names—noi code names or other abbreviations. For example, use "readability" rather than RDBLTY. Use the same name for a variable throughout your text, tables, figures, and appendixes. Names of organi zations and research instruments may be abbrevi ated, but give the full name the first time you mention one of these. Names of software and da tabases in common use may be abbreviated. Reporting Math Do not "talk in math" in regular text. Use words. For instance, "We surveyed 100 MBA students," not "We surveyed η = 100 MBA students." Do use sym bols and numbers to report results and give formu las. Italicize letters that are customarily italicized (e.g., p, r, b, F, Z). Put spaces on either side of equal signs, minus signs, etc. Illustrative results within text go in parentheses. Introduce them with com plete sentences. Example: Only one coefficient from the interaction tests was significant (model 3: β = 0.06, ρ &lt; .05).</page><page sequence="22">Academy οί Management Learning &amp; Education December Sexist or Biased Language Avoid language that may be interpreted as deni grating. Do not use "he" or "she" exclusively. Acad emy of Management publications favor use of the plural— changing "the professor ... he" to "profes sors ... they." When this is not possible, the phrase "he or she" should be used, or the pronoun may be varied, as appropriate to the context. Active Voice and First Person Write in the active voice ("They did it") instead of the passive voice ("It was done") to make it easy for readers to see who did what. Use the first person ("I" or "we") to describe what you, or you and your coauthors, did. Examples: Passive (less desirable)—Placing footnotes be low each page was the author's choice. Active (more desirable)—I chose to place foot notes below each page. Anthropomorphism Do not describe inanimate entities (models, theories, firms, and so forth) as acting in ways only humans can act. For example, a theory does not cause man agers' unethical behavior, although managers may use a theory to justify unethical behavior. Appendixes On the rare occasion in which long, detailed descrip tions of specific methodological matters appear nec essary, they are best located in one or more appen dixes. Here too, please be concise and focus on what is essential. Avoid, for example, exact reproductions of surveys. A single appendix should be titled AP PENDIX. If more than one appendix is needed, they should be titled APPENDIX A, APPENDIX B, and so on. A substantive title, such as "Items in Scales," should follow. If needed, label tables within appen dixes "Table Al," "Bl," and so forth. Tables and Figures Please consult published issues of AMLE for the preferred format of tables and figures. Consider carefully whether a table adds value to the depth and clarity of your argument, and avoid including one unless it presents data more vividly and con cisely than could be possible in the text. Tables should include columns and rows only. Any other visual representation should be labeled as a fig ure. Each table should have the word TABLE and its number centered at the top. The table title should be centered on the page directly under the table number. Example: TABLE 1 Effects of Caffeine Intake on Teaching Number tables consecutively, and group them together following the references. Indicate the po sition of each table in the text as follows: Insert Table 1 about here Variables in Tables Use the same name that you use in the main text for each variable. Don't use code names and ab breviations (See Abbreviations, above). Each table should report one type of analysis (which is identified in the title), and each vertical column and horizontal row should contain only one type of data. Data in Tables Report only fwo decimal places for all statistics. Place correlation coefficients in the lower-left tri angle area of their tables. Use superscript small letters for table footnotes. Significance levels go under your regular table footnotes (see example below). To assist with interpretation of statistics, sample size and effect sizes should be reported as part of each table. *p &lt; .05. **p &lt; .01. Alternatively, you may use a single lettered foot note: "Values greater than... are significant at... Figures Figures are any illustrations other than tables. Authors should be prepared to supply finished camera-ready artwork for all figures. Please make sure all internal labels of the figure are in Times New Roman type. Each figure should be produced on a separate page, with FIGURE and its number centered above it and a short identifying title cen tered underneath the figure number. Example: FIGURE 1 A Model of Moral Development in Executive Ed ucation Number figures consecutively, and group them together following tables. Indicate the position of each figure in the text as for tables. Example: Insert Figure 1 about here As of 2012, all Academy of Management publica</page><page sequence="23">2012 tions are printing color figures at the request of (and cost to) authors. We encourage you to con sider whether color is necessary to communicate your findings and only ask for this service if it aids in the understanding and interpretation of the manuscript. Color and other high-quality artwork should be submitted in final form as separate files. Line illustrations should be submitted at 900 dpi, while halftones and color can be submitted at 300 dpi or higher. Black and white files should be saved as TIFF or EPS files; color should be saved in CMYK format. Cost will be discussed with authors of accepted manuscripts after final color graphs and artwork are submitted. To view specific color art submission guidelines, please visit http://art.cadmus.com/da/index.jsp. Citations These are your in-text, in parentheses, identifica tions of other research. Every work that has a cita tion needs to have a corresponding reference (see "References," below). Examples: Name and year—Several scholars (Collinson, 2003; Coutu, 2002; Useem, 1989) espouse this view. Year only—But Mirvis (2008) presents a different perspective. Order Order citations alphabetically. Designate two or more works by one author (or by an identical group of authors) published in the same year by adding "a," "b," and so forth, after the year. Multiple Authors If a work has two authors, give both names every time you cite it. For three through six authors, give all names the first time, then use "et al." in cita tions. Examples: First citation—(Hoover, Giambatista, Sorenson, &amp; Bommer, 2010). Subsequent citation—(Hoover et al., 2010). For seven or more authors, use "et al." even for the first citation. The corresponding reference should give all the names. Page Numbers in Citations When quoting a source verbatim or reporting a specific result, a page number should always be provided. Use this format: Writing a book is "a long and arduous task" (Lee, 1998: 3). Citation With No Author For an article with no author, cite the periodical as author. Example: Periodical as author—Analysts predicted an in crease in service jobs (Wall Street Journal, 1999). For reports, handbooks, and the like, cite the "cor porate author" that produced them. For example: Organization as author—Analysts predict an in crease in service jobs in the U.S. Industrial Outlook (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1992). Such sources can also be identified informally. No corresponding reference will then be needed. For example: Informal citation—According to the 1999 U.S. In dustrial Outlook published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, service jobs will increase. Electronic sources Use a regular citation (author, year) if you can identify an author of one of the types discussed above (human, periodical, or corporate). If not, give the title of the web page that was your source in parentheses. Provide the complete web address in the references, as well as the date you retrieve!/ accessed the article. References References are your entries in the alphabetical list at the end of your article or research note. This list should include only work you have cited in your manuscript. Order Alphabetize references by the last name of a sole author, a first author, or an editor, or by the name of a corporate author (for instance, U.S. Census Bureau), the periodical (such as the Wall Street Journal), or web page title if there is no human author or editor. Order works from an identical author by year of publication, listing the earliest first. If the years of publication are also the same, differentiate entries by adding small letters ("a," "b," etc.) after the years. Repeat the author's name for each entry. Books. Follow this form: Last names, initials (sep arated by a space). Year. Title (Boldface italic, cap italize only the first letter of the first word and of the first word after a long dash or colon.) City where published: Name of publisher. (For small U.S. and Canadian cities, follow the name of the city with the postal abbreviation for the state or province; for small cities in other countries, give</page><page sequence="24">Academy of Management Learning &amp; Education December the full name of the country.)

Harvard Business Review, 87(6): 62-67. Include an issue number only if every issue of the referenced periodical begins with page 1, as in the Podolny example above. Look at more than one issue of the periodical to determine if an issue number is required. If an article has no author, the periodical is ref erenced as author. Examples: BusinessWeek. 1998. The best B-schools. October 19: 86-94. Harvard Business Review. 2003. How are we do ing? 81(4): 3. Chapters in books, including annuals. Follow this form: Authors' last names, initials. Year.

SUBMISSION PROCESS FOR ALL OTHER MANUSCRIPTS All other manuscripts must be submitted through AMLE's on-line submission and review website, ScholarOne, at http:llmc.manusciiptcential.com/ amle. You will need to have a digital copy of your file (such as one created with MS Word) from which all author-identifying information is removed. If you already have an account, you can upload your manuscript after logging in and clicking the "Au thor Center" link. If you do not have an account, then click "New User? Register here" link on the right. Fill out the form to create an account. After the account is created, click the "Author Center" link to submit your manuscript. During the file upload process you will designate the blinded manuscript as the "main document." A separate title page with all authors and contact information should be uploaded as a "supplemental file not for review." If you need assistance uploading your paper, please contact the ScholarOne helpline weekdays between 12:00 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. EST at 434-964 4100 or 888-503-1050 (both are U.S. phone numbers). Just prior to submission, you will need to confirm that: • the manuscript has been submitted solely to this journal and is not published, in press, or submitted elsewhere. • all the research meets the ethical guidelines, including adherence to the legal requirements, of the study country. • you have prepared (a) a complete text and (b) complete text minus the title page, acknowl edgements, and any running headers of author names, to allow blinded review. • you have any conflicts of interest (if you do, you must explain in detail). AMLE editors will not review manuscripts that they have previously rejected. However, manuscripts may be redeveloped for consideration as new man uscripts. In order for such a manuscript to be con sidered a new submission, the manuscript must: (1) address modified or new research questions, (2) incorporate new conceptual or theoretical argu ments, and (3) for empirical work, use additional or new data. Authors must note in their cover letters that the paper was derived from a previously re jected manuscript and describe how the proposed new submission addresses these criteria. Submission of a manuscript to AMLE also carries with it an implicit quid pro quo: willingness to review. The cornerstone of the peer-review process</page><page sequence="26">Academy of Management Learning &amp; Education December is the willingness of colleagues to provide devel opmental feedback. Authors who submit manu scripts to AMLE are expected to reciprocate by reviewing for AMLE if called upon to do so. PLAGIARISM DETECTION The Academy of Management is committed to ac tively combating plagiarism and publishing orig inal research. To help in these efforts, AMLE now uses the iThenticate software to detect instances of overlapping and similar text in submitted manu scripts. iThenticate compares submitted docu ments to extensive data repositories to create a comprehensive "Similarity Report," which high lights and provides links to any significant text matches. For more detail on the Academy of Man agement plagiarism policies, please visit the re vised Code of Ethics: http://aom.org/About-AOM/ Code-of-Ethics.aspx. REVIEW AND PUBLICATION PROCESS All manuscripts undergo editorial review. All man uscripts except Book and Resource Reviews also undergo a rigorous double-blind review process. The acceptance rate for submitted manuscripts at AMLE has historically been around 10%. Manuscripts will be evaluated by referees on the following criteria (criteria will be selectively ap plied, based on the nature and type of the manu script): • originality and importance of core ideas • quality of treatment of the relevant existing literature • quality of the presentation of ideas • design and execution of research methodology (if appropriate) • overall contribution of the article to the ad vancement of management education. Authors are encouraged to solicit feedback from colleagues on early drafts. A manuscript can be improved dramatically when knowledgeable re viewers are asked for reactions in advance of sub mission. Manuscripts are considered with the un derstanding that their contents have not been published and are not under consideration else where. Presentation of a paper at a professional meeting does not disqualify it from consideration. Accepted papers are copy-edited. Authors will have an opportunity to review edits in page proofs. AMLE's copy editor will contact you about two months before your article is scheduled to appear in print. If your article is accepted, please keep the managing editor (tjohnson@aom.pace.edu) and the copy editor (dcstuart@yahoo.com) informed of e mail address changes and any extended periods of unavailability.</page><page sequence="27">Statement of Ownership.
