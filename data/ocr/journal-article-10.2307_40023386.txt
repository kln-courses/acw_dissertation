International Journal for Philosophy of Religion (2006) 59:121-124 Â© Springer 2006 DOI: 10. 1007/sl 1 153-005-4373-0 Book review In this book, which is a sequel to Hell: The Logic of Damnation (University of Notre Dame Press, 1992), Walls continues his effort to rehabilitate these traditional eschatological concepts from the relative neglect they have suffered from philosophers of religion and theolo- gians in recent decades. In addition to responding to objections that have been raised against the doctrine of heaven, Walls seeks positively to show that this doctrine "is essential to any version of Christian- ity worth believing" (13) and that no satisfactory account of theodicy, morality or the meaning of life can do without it. The book is divided into seven chapters, each of which stands more or less on its own, despite the periodic recurrence of certain themes throughout. In the first chapter Walls argues that "any meaningful account of God's goodness implies some notion of heaven" (33). In Chapter Two he seeks to rehabilitate belief in purgatory in a man- ner acceptable to Protestants by arguing that sanctification is a nec- essary condition for entrance into heaven, and that it is reasonable to expect a benevolent God to allow those who have not done so on earth the opportunity to complete their sanctification after death. The third chapter explores several possible responses to the claim that the doctrine of heaven is morally abhorrent because it arbitrarily consigns to damnation those who had no opportunity to hear and embrace the Gospel. Chapter Four explores the problem of personal identity in relation to life after death, and defends the thesis that our per- sonal identity, both in this world and the next, is defined by our rela- tionships with others. In Chapter Five Walls argues that "heaven is an essential resource for any satisfactory theodicy" (116). Chapter Six draws on the work of Plantinga and Alston to assess the evidential value of near death experiences for beliefs about the hereafter. And in the final chapter Walls considers and rejects what he takes to be a number of secular heaven-surrogates, endorsing Mavrodes's observa- tions about the queerness of morality in a godless universe and argu- ing that existence without the hope of heaven is necessarily futile and meaningless.</page><page sequence="2">122 BOOK REVIEW One of the central claims running through this book is that the Christian conception of heaven is only intelligible when viewed in the context of a broader framework of beliefs about God, creation, sin, incarnation and salvation. Walls's effort to demonstrate the centrality of the doctrine of heaven in relation to these more familiar theological loci is compelling. Elucidating the intrinsic relationship between belief in heaven and other articles of Christian faith, however, and making a persuasive philosophical case for the former, are two distinct tasks that are not accomplished with equal success in this book. In his conclusion Walls concedes that "whether it is rational to believe in heaven hinges crucially on whether it is rational to believe in ... a God who is perfectly good" (199). In light of this acknowl- edgement, it is surprising that he does not devote more attention to a defense of this latter belief. The closest he comes to doing so is in the first chapter where he responds to certain arguments put forward by Philo in Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. In one passage in the Dialogues, while taking Cleanthes to task for his anthropomorphism, Philo argues that, if it is granted that God is omnipotent and omniscient, then, given the degree and extent of misery that afflicts sentient beings, it must be concluded that the pro- motion of their happiness was not the purpose of creation. Walls maintains that "Hume's conclusion that God is amoral is utterly implausible . . . [because] an amoral God would not be likely to cre- ate us with the sort of moral nature we have" (23). Thus, granted that God is omniscient and omnipotent, and in light of the fact that human beings are possessed of moral sentiments, it would be more reasonable to conclude that God is evil than that he is amoral. But, Walls contends, "since the idea of an evil deity is morally and prac- tically intolerable, Hume should either have denied God's existence or accepted his goodness" (29). Walls himself acknowledges that his response to Hume is pred- icated on the assumption that God is infinitely wise and powerful (22). But it is doubtful that Hume would have been prepared to grant this assumption. To assert (as Philo does in the Dialogues) "If A (God is omniscient) and B (God is omnipotent), then C (God is not benevolent)" is not yet to assert "A and B." Furthermore, Walls neglects other passages where Philo argues forcefully that we can have no knowledge of any divine attributes since we have no experience of them. A persuasive rehabilitation of the views of Demea with which Walls sympathizes would require substantive responses to such arguments as this one.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEW 123 Philosophers who seek to defend belief in a perfectly good God must confront the problem of evil, and one of the claims defended by Walls is that the concept of heaven is essential for any satisfactory the- odicy. This, according to Walls, is because belief in heaven "is what sustains our hope in the present and gives us reason to believe our hope is not an empty delusion" (118). It is true that belief in heaven is frequently related to the hope that the universe has an objective moral structure and that good will ultimately be rewarded, though it could be debated whether it is the belief that sustains the hope or the hope that sustains the belief. In either case, that belief in heaven provides a rational justification for "hope in the present" is a distinct claim the assessment of which depends upon how this phrase is understood. "Hope in the present" could be taken to mean either hope in the improvement of the present world, or hope that present wrongs will be made right in the hereafter. It doesn't seem that belief in heaven justifies the first kind of hope, since this belief is perfectly compati- ble with despair for the prospects of justice on earth. On the other hand, whether it is reasonable to hope that good will be rewarded in the hereafter depends entirely on whether belief in heaven is rationally defensible. At this point, however, Walls's argument appears to be circular. As noted earlier, Walls concedes that whether it is rational to believe in heaven hinges upon whether belief in a perfectly good God is justified. Clearly, this depends on whether it is possible to develop a satisfactory theodicy. And this, if Walls is correct, will depend again on whether belief in heaven is justified. In short, Walls lays out three claims that stand or fall together, but does not make a concerted effort to estab- lish any one of them. A more promising approach to defending belief in heaven might begin with an argument for God's goodness, pro- ceed by spelling out the need to postulate heaven in order to recon- cile the existence of a perfectly good God with the reality of evil, and then address objections that could be raised against the plausibility of belief in heaven. Walls devotes much of his book to explaining why theists are likely to prefer one philosophical position over another. In doing so, however, he frequently neglects to develop arguments in favor of the preferred position. This occurs, for example, when he sets out to "argue that the power of the theistic worldview gives us good reason to find dualism plausible" (157). While it's easy to see why someone's religious beliefs might incline them to embrace mind/body dualism, this inclination seems irrelevant to the question of whether dualism</page><page sequence="4">124 BOOK REVIEW is in fact plausible and the criticisms it faces can be answered. Walls notes that "dualists can provide a ready explanation of how identity is sustained between death and resurrection since, according to their view, the soul can continue to exist in conscious form when separated from the body in death" (105). If the second half of this sentence is true, then the first half is likely to be true as well. At no point, how- ever, does Walls defend the claim that the soul, rather than the brain, is "the locus of consciousness and memory" (101). Nor does he con- sider objections that might be raised against the conceivability of the same conscious individual continuing to exist in a disembodied state. The avoidance of these sorts of issues detracts from the effectiveness of his overall effort to reestablish belief in heaven on solid philosoph- ical ground. Those already committed to some form of theism, but for whom heaven has hitherto remained a peripheral concern, may find them- selves challenged by Walls's contention that belief in heaven follows logically from, and ought thus to be a central component of, their the- istic commitment. Those who do not approach Walls's book with an antecedent belief in the existence of a God who is perfectly good are unlikely to find his case for heaven compelling.
