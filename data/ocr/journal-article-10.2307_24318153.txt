Ber lin: Ekho Verlag, 2012. 176 pp., 130 b&amp;w illustrations, 6 color plates. ISBN 9783944415017 (cloth) €115.00. This book, a peer-reviewed compilation of articles by an international cohort of scholars, is the first volume of what the editors hope will be a continuing bi-lingual (English and Spanish) series about music archaeology (or archaeomusicology) of the Western Hemisphere—that is, the entirety of the Americas. The series is titled Flower World: Music Archaeology of the Americas, a name whose first part is easily remembered but perhaps misleading and not com pletely fitting for the entirety of the Americas; the subtitle more correctly addresses the goal of the series because it is not limited to a Meso-American ideological concept. Arnd Adje Both, the general editor, writes the following about the first part of the title: "Flower World, refers to a mythological, even sacred place filled with the sweet scent of flowers, bird calls, pleasant sounds, and dance. It is a place full of happiness and joy, even if it belongs to the realm of the Dead, which sustains the enduring renewal of life on earth." He continues to give specific examples from the ancient Aztec and Mayan cultures and the present Yoreme from northern Mexico, followed by an example from the Peruvian Moche that does not pertain to the con cept. My point is that the uniquely Meso-American viewpoint is not a valid interpretation for the rest of the pre-Columbian Americas (see Olsen 2005). In fact, this point is made clear by half of the articles within this volume. Indeed, with the possibility of about one-thousand five hundred Amerindian languages spoken—and many more musical languages performed—at the time of Columbus' first voyage to the New World in 1492 (Loukotka 1968:17), there must have been an unimaginable ideological diversity involving music and dance. Nevertheless, "Flower World," when used as a metaphor, suggests a type of extra-ordinary relationship of music as sound, symbol, and movement with nature, cosmology, and the afterlife. Seen in this way (which, however, is not suggested in the editor's introductory discussion of the term "Flower World"), the present somewhat disparate articles can be linked together to form a meaningful whole. Eight articles make up this volume, five in English and three in Spanish. In addition, an Introduction and Preface are presented in both languages by the editors. The first article, "Ancient Pututus Contextualized: Integrative Archaeoacoustics at Chavin de Huântar, Peru," is a highly scientific study by an acoustician (Miriam A. Kolar), anthro pologist (John W. Rick), computer scientist (Perry R. Cook), and audio engineer (Jonathan S. Abel). It is based on their argument that a sensory experience was central to the musicians, priests, and others that participated in rituals at the ancient Chavin ceremonial center in north ern Peru. Their conclusions are based on iconographie interpretations, conch shell trumpet (pututu) sound and playing technique analyses, acoustic analyses of the site itself, psychoa coustical analyses, and syntheses of data from earlier archaeological studies. The article is mostly about the authors' methodologies, however, explained in highly scientific terms. While the study is commendable because of its use of scientific methods, the authors' ideological conclusions are based on speculations because precise cultural intent will never be known through purely scientific measurements. However, several of their conclusions add acoustical evidence that validate earlier hypotheses by renowned Peruvian archaeologists. The second article, "Inca Songwork, 1535," by renowned musicologist Gary Tomlinson, is based on a 1535 Spanish chronicler's eyewitness account (which the chronicler wrote in 1552) of an Incan harvest festival from Cuzco known as Inca Raimi. Rather than being an ar chaeological material culture study (i. e., of musical instruments or iconography), Tomlinson's</page><page sequence="2">150 • the world of music (new series) 2 (2013) 2 article is sort of an archaeological/literary study of a manuscript written about an event that occurred just eight years after Pizzaro entered Peru. This type of analysis of the music history from the actual time period of the Inca is of vital importance to archaeomusicology because it provides a model for others to follow. Tomlinson uses the 1552 document much as an archae ologist would analyze an artifact. He includes additional literary and pictorial sources by other chroniclers, such as those by Guaman Poma from 1615 and Pablo José de Arriaga from 1621, which describe several particular types of sacred singing employed by the Inca. Tomlinson puts these data and others together to weave his convincing interpretations of the functions of Inca singing and how the Inca derived cosmic power from their songs and the singing itself. The third article, "Los aerôfonos de barro del Valle de Sula, Honduras" ["Clay Aero phones of the Sula Valley, Honduras"], is mostly descriptive of what the author, ethnologist Teresa M. Campos, calls simple whistles, double whistles, simple ocarinas, tri-chambered ocarinas in triangular shape, tri-chambered ocarinas in L shape, and tubular flutes—all the musical instruments are either zoomorphic, anthropomorphic, or anthropo-zoomorphic. The article includes several photographs and numerous illustrations of external and internal fea tures drawn by David Banegas (no mention is made of the use of x-rays as the bases for the illustrations of internal features). Following the author's descriptions of numerous aerophones chosen from the total number of 1325 in the collection that is housed in the Anthropology and History Museum in San Pedro Sula, she discusses historical and ethnographic accounts that mention the use of these types of musical instruments in ceremonies, festivals, and battles. She concludes by discussing recent ceramic aerophones made by several Honduran Amerin dian groups. From all her data, she makes the following assumptions about how the pre-Co lumbian aerophones were used: to bring happiness, celebrate, terrify, attack, send messages, call, give orders, advise, cure illnesses, and communicate with the gods. Such types of con textual conclusions without any proof, however, unfortunately lessen the effect of the article. Nevertheless, she accomplished her stated goal: to bring the collection to the attention of other researchers, especially archaeologists and musicians. The fourth article, "Ritual Dance and Music in Ancient Maya Society," by Matthew Loop er, is based on his and others' analyses and interpretations of ceremonial events depicted in iconography, such as Mayan paintings and sculpture. Most of the illustrations used are photo graphs or rollout drawings reproduced or drawn from other publications. This article is divid ed into discussions of dance and the cosmos, dance and society, dance and politics, and dance aesthetics. Unfortunately, most of the author's conclusions are speculations, and judging from the pictorial evidence, other interpretations could be made. Many of the illustrations include Mayan hieroglyphics that possibly offer contextual information, but they unfortunately are neither translated nor interpreted. Certain drawings are described as depicting dancers, but there is no evidence that the human figures are dancing; another describes "genital bloodlet ting," which is also not clear. Other music and dance iconography from additional second ary sources are mentioned without accompanying illustrations, making the author's points unclear. Finally, numerous conclusions about context seem to be made without iconographie evidence. The fifth article, "Sonidos en piedra: El canto, la müsica y el bade en el Monumento 21 de Bilbao, Cotzumalguapa, Guatemala" ["Sound in Stone: Song, Music and Dance in the Bilbao Monument 21, Cotzumalguapa, Guatemala"], by Oswaldo Chinchilla Mazariegos, is the author's interpretation of the music and dance iconography depicted on a large and com plex Mayan stone relief called Monument 21. Like the previous article, this is also plagued by interpretations that are not evident in the drawings. For example, human figures are said to</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews • 151 be singing, but their mouths are closed; some are said to be dancing, but their feet are clearly together and touching the ground. In this article the author discusses (according to the subsec tions) the musician, the dancer and singer, the elder woman, and the evocation of the flower world (in accordance with the theme of the volume). The sixth article, "Tunk'ul: Anâlisis de un instrumente musical maya en contextes rituales durante la Colonia," ["Tunk'ul: The Analysis of a Mayan Musical Instrument in Ritual Con texts during the Colonia Period"], is about the slit gong or slit drum that I refer to as the "H drum" because it has two tongues or "keys" shaped like a horizontal H that are struck with a mallet. This important idiophone is found among the Aztec, Maya, and Taino (Caribbean), al though the author does not make any comparisons of the instrument among those indigenous cultures. The article contains useful descriptive data about the tunk'ul and its construction among the Maya in Guatemala during the colonial period, although some of the contextual data does not seem to be related to the instrument itself. The seventh article, "Cantos de Venado: New Insights into Mexican Indigenous Perfor mance and Compositional Practices," by Helena Simonett has the clear purpose of discussing a post-encounter Mexican Amerindian music/dance tradition—Yoreme or Mayo deer songs— in terms of the pre-encounter Flower World; she explains that her study is a way to emphasize Amerindian resilience and its implications for understanding the pre-Columbian past. The au thor discusses in detail the importance of the flower as a spiritual metaphor among the Yoreme, as it is invoked in the deer songs. She establishes an important premise in Meso-American spirituality: songs are not like flowers, but songs are flowers. In a similar manner, the Warao of Venezuela explained to me that the stones in a rattle are not symbols of the spirits; they are the spirits (Olsen 1996:63). The author's use of ethnographic analogy with the Yoreme presents important implications into how the present can understand the Meso-American past. The eighth and final article of this volume, "An Organology of the Americas as Painted by John White and Other Artists," by Mark Howell, is an iconographie and organological study that analyzes several drawings and paintings by 16th century artists, relative to Amerindian musical instrument types and uses in the Virginia/Carolina region of North America. While the interpretation of music and dance in engravings and paintings are as problematic as in stone reliefs and other sculptures because music and dance performances are frozen in time, these 16th century art works are accompanied by detailed, if not somewhat ethnocentric, de scriptions by the artists themselves. The article is greatly enhanced by excellent reproductions of the art and copious informative footnotes. In conclusion, in spite of the shortcomings noted earlier, this volume offers an important contribution to the field of archaeomusicology. The series itself should be a valuable addition to the discipline—flowers or no flowers—and 1 look forward to the next volumes. Dale A.
