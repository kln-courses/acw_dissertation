MAY Oriental Institute University of Chicago Much light has been thrown upon the life of the Hebrews by a com- parative study of the religions of the Near East. It has made possible the observation of the religion of Israel against the background of the great masses of men and women in whose lives the cult functioned and out of whose experiences it grew, correcting our limited vision of the cult as a factor in a desert panorama. The result of this insight is that the religion of the Hebrews is not viewed as Old Testament theology, as concepts of deity in minds which happened to be burdened with superstitions concerning sacred trees and springs, but rather as part and parcel of the life of the everyday Israelite. The knowledge of the general pattern of near-eastern religion has placed in perspective the religion of the Hebrews. The essence of this pattern is found in the fertility cult, which cen- tered in the worship of the vegetation deity who died in the autumn and was resurrected in the spring. The religious services took the form of a dramatization of the death of the god, his resurrection, and his marriage to the mother-goddess. The popularity of this cult among the Hebrews has been abundantly evidenced by Old Testament scholars.' It was the predominant cult among the Egyptians, Syrians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and many other peoples of the Near East. 1 T. J. Meek, "Canticles and the Tammuz Cult," AJSL, XXXIX, 1 ff.; W. H.

The death of the god, the mourning rites and search for the departed deity, the resurrection, the marriage of the god and goddess, the designation and function of the male and female sacred prostitutes, the picturesqueness of the shrine and its relation to the everyday life of the people, the rBle of the divine offspring, human sacrifices, and many other phases of the cult mythology and ritual are revealed in the writings of Hosea. The corruptions of the text of Hosea, which permit a thousand and one plausible reconstructions, present great dangers of misinterpretation to fit the a priori conceptions of the in- terpreter, especially when he has such a tempting thesis as this to present. It must be remembered, however, that Hosea is concerned throughout with the popular cult, which was the fertility cult, and more references to it of an exact nature must be expected from Hosea than from other prophets whose interests were more political and social. Hosea belongs to the fertility-cult milieu more definitely than any other prophet. His concepts and symbols are more frequently those of that cult. THE DEATH OF THE GOD A recognition of the fact that Hosea frequently employs the sym- bolism of the death and resurrection of the vegetation deity clarifies many dubious passages in Hosea. As an introduction to his use of the cult symbolism a passage containing the imagery of the death and resurrection of the god, and indicating the resulting fertility, is quoted: When Ephraim saw his lacerations and Israel' his wounds, then Ephraim went to Assyria and sent to the great king.2 But he is not able to heal you, nor can he cure you of your wound, for I am like a lion unto Ephraim and like a young lion toward the house of Israel. I myself tear and go away. I carry off while none rescues. I will go away and return to my place, until they realize their guilt, and seek my face, [and] in their distress they seek me, [saying:]3 "Come, let us return to Yahweh, for he has torn and he will heal us. He has smitten and he will bandage us. He will make us live again after two days: on the third day he will resurrect us that we may live before him. .... His going forth is established like the dawn, and he shall come to us like the showers, like the spring rain that waters the land.4 I The context and parallelism demand this reading. So most commentators. 2 Cf. Syr. ~ ~ . The reading is dubious. 3 Note Syriac insertion obFo . 4 Hos. 5:13-6:3.</page><page sequence="3">THE FERTILITY CULT IN HOSEA 75 The chapter division is deceptive, for these verses are a unit,' representing an adaptation of the cult mythology. As the death of the vegetation deity from the attack of a wild animal is to be the destruc- tion of the people at the hands of Yahweh. As the god's expectation of resurrection with the coming of the fertilizing spring rains is to be the hope of the people that their desolation will be transmuted into prosperity.2 Their optimism, however, will be fruitless, for what has Yahweh to do with fickle Israel?3 Yahweh is represented as rending Ephraim as the wild boar tore Adonis.4 In the Palestinian environment the substitution of the lion for the boar is natural.5 The manner of the death of the god was con- ceived with almost infinite variation." The emphasis on the wounds of Ephraim is significant.7 Perhaps the self-inflicted wounds of the cult ritual symbolized the wounds of the slain god.8 Ephraim goes to Assyria for healing; for the same reason the wounded god descended to the land of no return, there to sit beneath the tree of healing and be cured by Ea, Ishtar, or demons.9 The expected healing, which in the 1 Marti, Volz, Cheyne, and others deny the genuineness of 5:15b--6:3 on the grounds that it is a late reference to the Exile. Such an excision is unnecessary with the foregoing interpretation. Baudissin (op. cit., p. 402) considers 5:13-6:3 a unit and an adaptation of cult symbolism. 2 Harper interprets this as an "assumed" repentance, but it is a satire on the normal cult reaction (W. R. Harper, "Amos and Hosea," ICC, p. 283). 3 Hos. 6:4 l is used of the dying god in Gen. 27:33 (H. G. May, "The Evolution of the Joseph Story," AJSL, XLVII, 87). 4 Hos. 5:14; cf. H. Strong, The Syrian Goddess, pp. 45, 46; J. G. Frazer, Adonis, Attis, Osiris, pp. 8, 23-26. 5 The Boghaz Keui reliefs evidence the association of the lion with the fertility cult (see J. Garstang, The Land of the Hittites, p. 228, P1l. LXV; Frazer, op. cit., pp. 100 if.). The lion symbolism associated with David is an indication that the Dod or Ariel cultus centered in his person (A. H. Godbey, "Ariel or the David Cultus," AJSL, XLI, 253 if.). 6 The fertility deity was variously conceived as meeting his death at the hands of the reapers, by self-castration, by burning, by drowning, by accident at the hands of another god, or by the attack of wild animals (Frazer, op. cit., pp. 48, 220, 262, 296; S. Langdon, Tammuz and Ishtar, pp. 11-15; Epic of Creation, p. 39; Rawlinson, History of Phoenicia, p. 335; J. P. Peters, "The Worship of Tammuz," JBLit., XXXVI, 106). 7 1j1 is apparently synonymous with 'lrTI , signifying lacerations received from weapons or animals, and not mere sickness as in other occurrences (see also Isa. 1:5; 53:4, 5; Jer. 6:7; 10:19). A New Year liturgy reads in part: "The .... which touch him beneath and with which they clothe him: these are the wounds with which they wound him; with his blood (they are dyed)" (Langdon, Epic of Creation, p. 37; see Frazer, op. cit., pp. 26, 184, 185, 221, 222). 8 Such may be the significance of the wounds referred to in Hos. 7:14; Zech. 13:5. Such was the significance of self-castration (cf. Frazer, op. cit., pp. 221 if.). 9 See Langdon, Tammuz and Ishtar, pp. 30-32; F. A. Vanderburgh, "Babylonian Tammuz Lamentations," A.JSL, XXVII, 316-21; Albright, op. cit., pp. 125, 126. Tammuz was the "healer" par excellence (see Langdon, Tammuz and Ishtar, pp. 32-38). Eshmun, the Syrian counterpart of Tammuz, played a similar rOle, being identified by</page><page sequence="4">76 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES cult was taken as a matter of course, will in this instance not occur. That the fertility-cult symbolism is used here by Hosea is further evidenced by the mention of a resurrection.' This will be discussed later. In 13:1 ff. Hosea again uses the symbolism of the dying and resur- rected deity. Ephraim is dead.2 Yahweh, as a wild beast, has waylaid him,3 and, having died, he is in Sheol.4 After the analogy of the dying god he would expect to be resurrected. But it is not to be. Yahweh asks:5 "Shall I rescue them from the power of Sheol? Shall I redeem them from death? Where are your plagues, 0 death? Where is your destruction, 0 Sheol? Compassion is hid from my eyes."6 In other words, Yahweh demands to know what has happened to the effective- ness of death and Sheol. Have they lost their power? No! This time the grave will not give up its dead; the resurrection will not be con- summated, for Yahweh will have no compassion, and the result will be as though the fertility-god did not rise. An east wind from the desert will dry up the fountains and springs.7 the Greeks with Asclepius (Corpus inscriptionum Semiticarum, No. 143; see also Gesenius, Inscripturae linguaeque Phoeniciae, No. 4). For the identification of Adonis and Eshmun see Barton, "The Genesis of the God Eshmun," JAOS, XXI, 188 ff. Baudissin (op. cit., pp. 310 ff.) has established the usage of the root btt"j in connection with the dying gods of Agade, Assyria, Babylonia, Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Palmyra. 1 Hos. 5:13-6:3 is strangely parallel to the poem of the suffering servant (Isa. 53:1 if.). The wounds and lacerations of the servant, his death, and his resurrection are drawn from the cult symbolism. Significant also is the healing efficacy of his sufferings (vs. 5). For a discussion of possible fertility-cult origin of this symbolism see H. Gressmann, Der Ur- sprung der israelitisch-jiidischen Escatologie, pp. 330-33; Baudissin, op. cit., pp. 423, 424. 2 Hos. 13:1. 3 Hos. 13:7. 4 In Cant. 8:6 2r1J and 1S?Ib are represented as overcome by the power of love. Isaiah refers to Sheol in his parody on the Dod vineyard song (see Graham, op. cit., pp. 177, 178). 5 There is no versional support for reading this as a question, but the context demands it. So most commentators. 6 Hos. 13:14. 7 Hos. 13:15. The dubious stichos   P 1   N'1 'I is to be omitted as a scribal note on the division of the United Kingdom, if the versional emendation of "' for btP10 is to be accepted. Conceivably, however, this is a concessive clause, describing the fruitfulness of Ephraim as compared with the other tribes, in spite of which an east wind is coming to destroy him. The symbolism may be drawn from the fertilizing powers of the god, who was conceived as one among brothers (see May, op. cit., p. 89). In the cult, as here (13:13; cf. 11:1), the dying god was represented as a son as well as a husband or brother. The name "Tammuz" (Sumerian Damu) signifies "son" (Langdon, Tammuz and Ishtar, pp. 6, 7; cf. Frazer, op. cit., pp. 6, 42). In the Babylonian "Song of Songs" we read: "Oh, come down to the garden of the king, which reeks with cedar. Thou, O son, art a lover of my bosom. On the other side of the river is the city of lamentation ..... Oh, I long for the couch of the sons" (trans. Meek in art. in Schoff, op. cit., pp. 75, 77). The youth of Canticles was represented as a son (Cant. 8:1, 2, 5). Joseph was the beloved son (Gen. 37:3).</page><page sequence="5">THE FERTILITY CULT IN HOSEA 77 It is evident from Ezekiel's description of the female yoshevoth weep- ing for Tammuz that the Hebrews were acquainted with the belief that the dying god went to Sheol.' The city through which the maiden of Canticles wandered was doubtless the city of the dead.2 More often among the Hebrews, as also sometimes among the Babylonians and Assyrians, the god was represented as being at a distance or asleep.3 In Hosea the reference is more frequently to the departed deity, whose absence causes a general failure of the forces of fertility in men, animals, and vegetation. The most striking example of this is to be translated: With their flocks and their herds they shall come to seek Yahweh, but they shall not find [him]. He has withdrawn from them. They have been faithless to Yahweh in that they have borne illegitimate children. Now the new moon will devour them with their fields.4 The deity has departed, and their ritual searchings will be in vain. Since the deity is not present, they and their fields will be devoured. The forced departure of the god through capture by the enemy had the same effect on vegetation.5 When the calf6 of Bethel has been carried away to Assyria as tribute, priest and people shall bewail him, and the ritual rejoicings shall cease.' The fertile vineyards about the sanctuary shall be replaced by thorns and thistles.8 Likewise, when Yahweh journeys away from Ephraim, the result is the coming of sterility, so that there are no more births, mother- hood, or conceptions, and the children which the people are rearing 1 Ezek. 8:14. 2 Cant. 3:2; 5:7, etc. Cf. the "city of lamentation" in the translation by Meek, in Schoff, loc. cit. 3 This same reticence in the matter of mentioning the word "death" appears in the Babylonian rituals in which it is deliberately shunned or discreetly paraphrased. See F. Bohl, "Das Menschenopfer bei den alten Sumerern," ZA, XXXIX, 95 and we read: " 'Tammuz, the lord, slumbers,' in woe they sigh much." "The lord Idin-Dagan sleeps, and the gardens of themselves restrain [their growth]" (Langdon, Tammuz and Ishtar, pp. 20, 26). See also Cant. 1:7; 2:8; 6:1; 8:1. The same concept appears in the taunting of the prophets of Baal by Elijah on Mount Carmel (I Kings 18:27). 4Hos. 5:6, 7. 5 Hos. 10:5 ff. 6 Hos. 10:5, reading 37P (sing.) with the Syriac and LXX. 7 The interpretation of 10:5c by the versions is conflicting. All of them, however, seem to have read , and in view of Mic. 1:10 I read 1?1T 4? for 1I9 1y . Most commentators change to l)nI or i . So Wellhausen, Nowack, Marti, Harper, Scott, Riessler, Peiser, and others. 8 For thorns and thistles as symbols of lack of fertility see Isa. 5:6; 32:13; Hos. 2:8; Cant. 2:2. See Isa. 7:21-25, which W. C. Graham maintains is a unity with what precedes and a sarcastic prediction that unfruitfulness will result from the fertility cult.</page><page sequence="6">78 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES die.' A miscarrying womb and dry breasts are then their lot.2 Simi- larly, when Yahweh "turns,"3 he takes away the corn, wine, wool, and flax, proving thereby that he, and not Baal, has control over the forces of fertility.4 The clearest example of the lack of fertility resulting from the absence of the fertility deity is to be found in the incident of the trial of Elijah and the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel.5 The scene is laid in the midst of a devastating drought, and the obvious object of the prophets' prayers is rain and not fire. It seems probable that in the original incident the petitions were for rain,6 and it may have been a later editor who supplied the variation of the miracle of fire. The technique of the prophets of Baal was similar to that used in the mourning rites, and they were attempting to arouse a deity who was asleep, on a journey, or gone aside.7 THE MOURNING RITES The departure of the deity and consequent death of the vegetation were accompanied by ritualistic wailing, the characteristics of which were similar to the wailing for a dead relative or friend.8 This may be 1 Hos. 9:11, 12. Read 'Z. with Vulgate, recessero. So Ewald and Hitzig. Cf. Seb. 2 Hos. 9:14. 3 Hos. 2:11, "Ig. Whence is the deity to return-to or from Canaan? Harper's suggestion, "take back again," is logically awkward, and Wellhausen's reading, "hold back," is without analogy. Scott (The Message of Hosea, p. 31) omits it. The versions are as noncommittal as the Hebrew, reading convertar, to.3ml, brtarpe'4w. The text is perhaps to be interpreted in the light of Hos. 5:15, 'niiP -*, " , referring to the return of Yahweh to his "place," i.e., his home, conceived of as being at a distance (see Harper, op. cit., p. 282). As a result of this departure of Yahweh, the grains and wines are removed. 4 Hos. 2:11. 5 I Kings 18:27. 6 In its present form the story belongs to the cycle of traditions of fantastic miracles clustering about the person of Elijah. It represents an adaptation by the Deuteronomist, protesting against the rites of the local cults. The phrase 1 (vs. 28) is retrospec- tive, pointing to a later-developed tradition. Vss. 42 ff. give a hint of the real object of the prophets' prayers. The episode of the 450 prophets who sat at Jezebel's table and their total destruction has an air of unreality. 7 Many parallels to this might be quoted. A Tammuz ritual contains the following verses: "For the far removed there is wailing, Ah me, my child, the far removed, My Damu, the far removed ....." The wailing is for the plants; the first lament is "They grow not," etc. (Langdon, Tammuz and Ishtar, p. 10; cf. p. 26). Another lament reads: "O Arulu, the seized away, return, O Arulu, to the stalks and sheepfolds return." -LANGDON, Sumerian Liturgical Texts, p. 117. 8 Cf. I Kings 18:28 with Jer. 16:6 and Deut. 14:1. This characteristic of the cult-wail- ing rites is further indicated by the fact that human sacrifices, doubtless symbolizing the death of the god, were consummated at the shrine festivities.</page><page sequence="7">THE FERTILITY CULT IN HOSEA 79 taken as evidence that the popular cult of the Hebrews was concerned with the dying god. A passage from Joel indicates the symbolism under which the ritual was consummated: Wail, like a virgin girded with sackcloth, For the bridegroom of her youth.' A drought which destroyed the crops, or a locust plague, as well as the annual death of the vegetation at the time of harvest, were con- sidered the result of the departure of the god. Which occasion called forth the ritual wailing is not always evident from the text. The prev- alence of these rites is indicated by the profuse vocabulary expressing the ritual mourning.2 The most revealing reference to this aspect of the cult ritual as found in Hosea is to be translated as follows: And they do not cry unto me in their hearts when they wail upon their couches.3 For corn and wine they lacerate themselves:4 they revolt against me.6 Although I was the one who strengthened their arms," yet they con- spired evil against me. They turned to Baal, etc.7 The couches in the shrines are well known to us from Hebrew, Babylonian, and Sumerian sources.8 That the couch was prominent 1 Joel 1:8. Cf. the following Tammuz lamentation: "His bride to her dwelling he caused to return, the shining one, the mistress of heaven, to the land's house of rest. Thither she entered: wailing (?) she sat up. The goddess, the mistress of heaven, like one in the darkness she sitteth in the place of humiliation" (Vanderburgh, op. cit., p. 314). This text may shed light on the nature of the Heb. yosheveth (see W. C. Graham, "Some Suggestions toward the Interpretation of Micah 1:10-16," AJSL, XLVII, 238 ff.). 3 Harper (op. cit., p. 305) and Gardner (AJSL, XVIII, 108), unaware of the cult back- ground, would read a ljT for fnlrjZt . Riessler (Die kleinen Propheten, p. 36) correctly associates this passage with the fertility cult, comparing it with Lev. 19:28 and I Kings 18:26 ff. This couch is to be compared with the couch of the maiden of Canticles, where it was probably located in the i1 ~ r1 or ?I ot (Cant. 3:1; cf. 2:4; 3:4; 8:2). Ehrlich significantly associates it with the 0i"0" 1 2 of Ezek. 23:17. The sentence division after o 7IZIrD is uncertain. I have read with the versions, but the parallel idiom of Joel 1:11 may indicate that we should read: ". ... When they wail upon their couches for corn and wine. They cut themselves" (see J. M. P. Smith, The Old Testament: An American Translation). 4 Read ' Jj1rj with the LXX Wellhausen, Nowack, Marti, J. M. P. Smith, Harper, Riessler, Peiser, and others. It is possible that a form of jj? is to be read, which, in view of Hos. 10:5, might signify ritual wailing. 6 This stichos is suspiciously corrupt. The balance is awkward and there is no parallel- ism. 6 Omit oini with the LXX. So Harper, Riessler, Marti, and others. 7 Hos. 7:14-16. Read Y 'Z for . So Harper, J. M. P. Smith, Nowack, and others. 8 Isa. 57:7, 8; Ezek. 23:17 and Cant. 3:1 associate the Z1ZV with the Israelite fertil- ity cult and the motif of the marriage of the god and goddess. The chamber of the goddess at the Sumerian shrines contained such a couch (see Woolley, The Sumerians, pp. 146,</page><page sequence="8">80 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES also in the Hebrew shrines is evidence of the close similarity between the Hebrew and non-Hebrew cults of the Near East. These couches were primarily associated with the ritual of the marriage of the god and goddess.' Their' appearance in Hosea in connection with the wail- ing rites recalls Joel's admonition to wail as a virgin for the bridegroom of her youth.2 That Hosea is picturing a scene at the shrine wherein the wailing is for the dead or departed deity is evidenced by his use of the word -r71-trn .3 It is probable that the Deuteronomic objection to ritual laceration for the dead was because of its association with the fertility cult of the local shrines.4 There is an abundance of evidence of the practice of ritual self-laceration among the Hebrews in connection with the fertility cult. Jeremiah chided the Jerusalemites because they cut themselves in the shrine of the zonah,5 and it may have been in the shrine of the zonah that the couches of Hos. 7:14 were located. Rahab, a zonah, lived in such a shrine.6 So common a practice was this ritual laceration that the prophet of the cult shrine could be identified by the wounds' he had received in the 2M2 rit, which is perhaps to be identified with the shrine of the zonah.8 The prophets lacerated 152). Gudea presents a picturesque description of the Sumerian chamber of the goddess and the couch ritual (see G. Barton, Royal Inscriptions of Sumer and Akkad, pp. 239-45; also Sayce, The Religion of Ancient Egypt and Babylonia, p. 455; trans. by Meek in art. in Schoff, loc. cit.). Graham (AJSL, XLVII, 241) has some pertinent remarks on the root =Z= (cf. Baudissin's remarks on this root, op. cit., p. 405). 1 Note the significance of D Tf 21~Z (Ezek. 23:17). See Graham's analysis of ""JI1 in op. cit., XLV, 167-69. 2 Joel 1:8. 3 Jos. 7:14. F. E. Peiser's reconstruction of this verse as a reference to the wailing rites for the gods Ammiu and Dagan, while somewhat drastic, recognizes the essential cult significance of the passage 1011I.liMh i w -- T7 Y E .~7Df 1 47 1 (Philotogische Studien zum Alten Testament, pp. 28, 29). 4 Deut. 14:1, 2. The prohibition was purposed to distinguish the Yahwist from the non-Yahwist. Shaving off the hair as a sign of mourning, referred to in this law and in the parallel legislation of Lev. 19:27, is to be noted. Lucian informs us that shaving the head was an Adonis mourning rite: "They proceed to shave their heads, too, like the Egyptians on the loss of their Apis. The women who refuse to be shaved have to submit to the following penalty, viz., to stand for the space of an entire day in readiness to expose their persons for hire" (Strong, op. cit., p. 46). The context of the Leviticus legislation suggests cult practices. 5 Jer. 5:7, no'? niT . 6 Jos. 2:1, Off igg nit. 7 rZ; cf. "j'== fl I(Hos. 6:1). 8 Zech. 14:6.

We may assume that the mourning for the calf-god of Beth-Aven, as he departed from Canaan and was bewailed by people and priests, was accompanied by rites such as these.2 One of the wailing cries seems to have been, "My God, we, Israel, know thee!"3 It is to be compared with the lamentation, "Alas the day! Destruction from the Almighty has come!"4 The death of the vegetation was interpreted as the mourning and languishing of nature. The land itself mourns as everything that dwells therein languishes.5 Isaiah refers to the mourning of the new wine and the languishing of the vine.6 The parallelism of a passage from Joel is striking: The priests mourn, the ministers of Yahweh; The field is devastated, the ground mourns, etc.7 This conception of the mourning of the land has its parallel in other Semitic cults. A cow wails to Ishtar and the sea is terrified.8 The gardens of themselves restrain their growth when Idin-Dagan sleeps.9 The very river ran red from Aphaca to the sea at the death of Adonis, and the red anemone dyed the face of nature with his blood.10 THE SEARCH FOR THE GOD The search of the goddess for her dead consort formed one of the most prominent and widespread motifs of the cult mythology. It ap- peared in various forms. Ishtar searched the land of no return for her consort, Tammuz. Demeter, the mother, sought everywhere for Eury- dice. Isis crossed the waters from Egypt to Gebal in order to find Osiris. Aphrodite hastened to her wounded lover, tearing her divine flesh on the thorns of the white rose which she dyed with her sacred blood. The maiden of Canticles sought her lover in the city. It is 1 I Kings 18:28. Here, as in Zech. 14:6, it is the prophets who lacerate themselves, recalling the actions of the modern dervish. This is consistent with Hosea's description of the prophets as maddened "men of spirit" (Hos. 9:7; cf. Jer. 29:26). 2Hos. 10:5. 3 Hos. 8:2. 4 Joel 1:15; cf.

The search of the maiden of Canticles for her lover is paralleled in the metaphor of the zonah and her lovers in the second chapter of Hosea.2 The woman shall 'pursue after her lovers, who, as will be later shown, are the male prostitutes and personify the vegetation deity. Although she seeks them, she will not overtake them, for Yahweh has beset her way with thorns and erected a wall against her. The diction of this passage is strangely similar to that of the ritual of the search of the maiden for her lover.

The watchmen of the city smote the maiden of Canticles, stripping her mantle from her when she sought her lover.5 Ishtar was impeded in her search by the watchmen of Hades, and her mantle was snatched from her.6 Beltis had to pass the watchmen at the gate of Bel's (Marduk's) sepul- cher.7 The author of Hos. 2:8, 9 represents Yahweh as the one who obstructs the search of the zonah for her lovers, preventing her from finding her paths.8 The resemblance to the usual search motif becomes doubly certain when we learn that Yahweh is to strip the woman naked, even as in the Babylonian and Canticles versions the searcher was stripped by the watchmen.9 The reference to the wall of the zonah is made intelligible by a comparison with Isa. 5:5, and we may assume that it is the wall of the vineyard which is signified.10 There may be some significance in the thorns which are to hinder the search, for we 1Usually written TP= (or "Ir , I MS, 1j) and N27. 2Hos. 2:8, 9; cf.

This interpretation of the imagery of Hos. 2:8, 9 is more natural than supposing it to refer to the life of a shepherd and his sheep according to Harper (op. cit., p. 236) and Gardner ("Notes on Certain Passages in Hosea," AJSL, XVIII, 177). 9 Hos. 2:11, 12. 10o See Graham, AJSL, XLV, 167 if.

More probably, however, they represent the lack of fertility, the thorns of the foreign growths in the devastated vineyard as in Isa. 5:5. In a passage which exudes an agricultural aroma there is another reference to the search for the absent deity.2 The search took place in the springtime. There is the sowing of the seed in high hopes for the harvest, the breaking-up of the fallow ground, and the coming of the spring rains.3 This is the proper time to seek Yahweh until he comes and rains righteousness. In the previously discussed passage in which Ephraim is repre- sented as the fertility-god who will not be resurrected on the third day Yahweh appears with the characteristics of the true departing deity.4 As a result of his return to his place, general desolation overtakes the land. It is he whom Ephraim will seek and whose coming forth is like the spring rains which water the land.5 Great sacrifices accom- panied the search, for Hosea prophesies that, in spite of the flocks and herds brought by the people when they seek Yahweh, only desolation and destruction will eventuate.6 Hos. 11:7 has received as many and varied interpretations as any verse in the Old Testament. Another is possible from the fertility- cult viewpoint. It is to be read: My people are dependent on my turning back: To Baal they call, but he does not arise.7 1 Frazer, op. cit., pp. 185, 186. 2 Hos. 10:12. The diction is significant: *i?V * ,' . 3 The fertilizing spring rains were evidence that the search was successful and the deity was to return. Cf. I Kings 18:41, which is the true sequel to the rites on Mount Carmel. Note the coming of the fertility-god in the wake of the rains according to Cant. 2:8 ff. (see vs. 11). The following extract from a Sumerian ritual describing the marriage of the god and goddess at the New Year is significant: "He [Enlil] received her [Ninlil]; he cohabited with her; he caused it to rain" (J. P. Peters, "Notes and Suggestions on Early Sumerian Religion and Its Expression," JOAS, XLI, 143). 4 Hos. 5:15-6:3. There is a fine bit of sarcasm in the words of Ephraim. He, as the dying god, must look to Yahweh for his power of resurrection, seeking him who caused his death rather than be sought for by others. And Ephraim will recognize Yahweh as the true fertility-god who comes with the rains. This is to be compared with the sarcasm of Isaiah in Isa. 5:1 ff. 5 Hos. 6:3. 6 Hos. 5:6. 7 For variant interpretations see Harper, op. cit., p. 386; Scott, op. cit., p. 145; A. E.

THE RESURRECTION Both the death and the resurrection of the god were celebrated at the New Year festival. To symbolize the winter season which passed between the time of the death and the resurrection of the god, it was necessary to provide an interim between the rites dramatizing these events. According to a text from Ashur, eleven days were required to consummate the action of the drama." At Aphaca, Adonis was mourned one day and his resurrection was dramatized the following day.3 In the spring festival of Cybele and Attis at Rome the resurrec- tion occurred on the fourth day.4 According to Plutarch's De Iside et Osiride the death of Osiris fell on the seventeenth of Athyr, and he was "found" on the nineteenth of Athyr.5 The late Hebrew conception is represented in the story of the death and resurrection of Jesus, accord- ing to which the deity was resurrected on the third day, after two days in the grave.6 There is apparently a reference to this interim between the death and resurrection of the god in Hosea, and it corresponds with the last two above-mentioned conceptions.7 Harper long ago recognized the reference to the resurrection in Hos. 6:2, suggesting that it may have inspired Ezekiel's vision of the valley of dry bones.8 The symbolism of Ephraim in this passage as the dying god has already been noted. His expectation of resurrection in verse 2 is also drawn from the cult imagery. MrI is frequently employed to signify the restoration of life 1 Note the use of the form I r'I to indicate the return of the springtime of the year (II Sam. 11:1; I Kings 21:22, 26; II Chron. 36:10, etc.). 2 Langdon, Epic of Creation, pp. 53 ff. 3 Frazer, op. cit., pp. 182-84. 4 Ibid., pp. 221-28. 5 See Wiedermann, Die Religion der alten Agypter, p. 112. 6 Cf. Mark 14:58. Baudissin (op. cit., p. 409) notes that the conception of the three days and three nights that Jonah spent in the belly of the fish may have originated from the same cult motif of a resurrecting deity. The belly of the fish is here a substitute for the underworld. 7 Hos. 6:1, 2. 8 Harper, op. cit., p. 283; see Ezek. 37:1-10.</page><page sequence="13">THE FERTILITY CULT IN HOSEA 85 to the dead,' and Ip) is used to signify resurrection of the dead.2 Further, the usual interpretation of 'U'=it 21. ";'i- cannot be accepted, for the text must be radically changed to make it conform to the idiom signifying "a few days."3 No change in text is needed if the expression is interpreted as referring to the resurrection on the third day, after two days. We have already referred to Hosea's description of the return of the deity with the fertilizing rains,4 the resurrection of the dead Ephraim from Sheol,5 and the dependence of the people on the "re- turn" of Yahweh rather than Baal.6 When the symbolism was that of a departing rather than a dying god, the return took the place of the resurrection.7 THE DIVINE MARRIAGE The return of the god was followed by his marriage to the goddess, and much of the symbolism of Hosea and other prophets is to be understood from this viewpoint.8 This divine union was the most prominent aspect of the cult ritual. It is frequently found entirely apart from the motif of the dying god.9 This is especially true of the Sumerian cult.' For the greater part, however, the two conceptions in I I Sam. 2:6; Deut. 32:39; cf. Isa. 26:14, 19; Ezek. 37:6, 10. For a discussion of the use of *I7~" in relation to the deity see Baudissin, op. cit., pp. 450-510. 2 Isa. 14:9; 26:14, 19; Ps. 68:2 (used of the deity); 88:11; Job 14:12, etc. Cf. Syr. .0 , "resurrection." 3 Cf. II Kings 9:32; Amos 4:8. W. R. Smith (The Prophets of Israel, p. 188) says of Hos. 6:2, "But to Hosea the repentance of the nation is as a resurrection from the dead." 4 Ios. 6:3; 10:12. 5 Hos. 13:14. For a similar discussion of this verse see Baudissin, op. cit., pp. 406, 407. 6 Hos. 11:7. See Cant. 2:8 ff. 8 "The representation of a god as the husband of his land was close at hand in the Baalism of the day, in which this was the basic thought," writes J. M. P. Smith in The Prophet and His Problems, p. 115. 9 See Ezek. 16:1 ff.; Gen. 6:1-4; Ps. 45. The latter is a song celebrating the marriage of the king as god (see J. M. P. Smith, "Traces of Emperor Worship in the Old Testa- ment," AJSL, XXXIX, 37). 10 The early Sumerians may not have worshiped the dying god, for this motif does not appear in the early royal inscriptions. Tammuz and Ininni are not closely associated with each other before the Agade supremacy. Baudissin (op. cit., pp. 356-60) suggests that Tammuz was not originally a resurrecting springtime deity. The month does not seem to have been named after him until Sargonic times. The motif of the dying god in the Near East may have originated with the I1urrians, who apparently preceded the Sumerians, Semites, and Indo-Europeans, and who may be responsible for many of the common ele- ments in the near-eastern religious culture (see E. A. Speiser, Mesopotamian Origins, pp. 164-78). The marriage of the god and goddess might be called the "typical" motif of the popular Sumerian religion. For an example of this see Gudea's Inscription, Cylinder B (see I. M. Price, The Great Cylinder Inscriptions of Gudea, pp. 39 if.).</page><page sequence="14">86 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES Hebrew thought are combined. The marriage of the god and goddess was dramatized by the sacred prostitutes. The god, goddess, and offspring were the center of the cult, forming a sort of trinity. These trinities appear throughout the Near East.' In Canticles there seems to be a trinity of mother, daughter, and lover.2 The divine marriage rites made some sort of trinity inevitable, for the offspring of the human representatives of the divine pair was regarded as a child of the gods.3 Sons of the god are frequently men- tioned in the Old Testament. The Judeans, in a metaphor obviously drawn from fertility-cult practices, are represented by Ezekiel as the product of the marriage between Yahweh and the virgin Jerusalem.4 The sons of the zonah in Hos. 2:4 are obviously hers by her first hus- band, Yahweh.5 1 Many, although not all, of the liturgies refer to the offspring of the divine union. A New Year liturgy of the Sumerians represents the marriage of Enki and Nintu and the consequent birth of Takku (Tagdug) (see M. Jastrow, "Sumerian Myths of Beginnings," AJSL, XXXIII, 128-30; Langdon, Epic of Paradise, pp. 66 if.). In the liturgy of the death and resurrection of Bel-Marduk, Marduk, Beltis, and Nebo appear as the chief personages (see Langdon, Epic of Creation, pp. 35-37). The Hittite trinity is known to us from the rock reliefs of Boghaz Keui (see Strong, op. cit., p. 6). The Egyptian trinity of Osiris, Isis, and Horus is familiar. See H. W. Cartwright, "Iconography of Certain Egyptian Divinities," AJSL, XLV, 183-84. The name Tammuz means "son" (Sumeria;r damu), and he is variously conceived as brother, husband, and son of Ishtar. Originally he may have represented the inundating waters which came as a result of the marriage of the god and goddess. His name, "Damu-zi-abzu," may indicate this. Cf. the r8le of Takku. 2 Cant. 3:4; 8:2. The youth is also represented as a son born with the New Year beneath the sacred apple tree (Cant. 8:5). 3 The kings and their queens often acted in the r61e of the god and goddess in the New Year ritual. The identification of the king with Osiris had its origin here (see A. Erman, The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians, pp. 2-10). Ishme-Dagan was apparently the off- spring of the New Year marriage, for he calls himself "first-born son of the holy goddess" (see Langdon, Sumerian Liturgical Texts, II, 141). Gudea likewise boasts that he is "Gudea, begotten in an eminent sanctuary of Gatumdug" (see Price, op. cit., p. 21). Dungi, who was worshiped as a divine king, spoke of himself as the son of the goddess Ninlil (see Barton, Sumerian Religious Texts, I, 29). 4 Ezek. 16:20. 1 If this is recognized, the motivation for the interpolation of vs. 6 is clear. The inter- polator objected to the crudity of the conception which made the offspring the sons of Yahweh, and he wished to identify the sons with those of Gomer in Hos. 1 :2 if. Chapter 2, however, does not condemn the sons, but rather the mother. The sons are worthy to plead with the mother. Harper omits 2:6 on other grounds. It is logically awkward, and the introductory *i presages a gloss (see Harper, op. cit., p. 228). The i"ff TM%= of Hos. 5:7 may also be offspring of the sacred prostitute in the mar- riage rites, and the expression may be somewhat analogous to the phrase :)011T 2T of Hos. 1:2. The root "-T is frequently used to describe a zonah (Prov. 2:16; 5:3, 20; 7:5; 20:14, etc.). "IT signifies a deity other than Yahweh (Deut. 32:16; Isa. 43:12; Jer. 2:25, etc.). The point is that these are not the children of Yahweh, but rather, as J. M. P. Smith translates, "illegitimate sons" (The Old Testament: An American Translation). For a discussion of the sons of the gods see Frazer, op. cit., pp. 10 ff.</page><page sequence="15">THE FERTILITY CULT IN HOSEA 87 In the Hebrew cult the offspring of the New Year marriage rites were given names symbolic of their status or of the significance of the ritual. The name of Samuel may indicate his divinity, for it certainly is not explained by the popular etymology ascribed to it.' That Hannah and perhaps Elkanah took part in the divine marriage rites seems probable from the description of the shrine practices2 and the LXX preservation of the text of I Sam. 1:18.3 The names of the chil- dren of Isaiah seem to have been formed after this analogy of giving symbolic names to the offspring of the cult rites. The second child was borne to him by a prophetess, and there is no hint that she was his wife.4 1 I Sam. 1:20. The name is to be interpreted "His-Name-Is-God" (see Frazer, op. cit., pp. 70-72). The "angels" who visited Abraham's tent may have been members of a band of wandering prophets who acted as r:01TP (Gen. 18:1 ff.)A, and Isaac may have received his name as a result of this fertility-cult origin. For the sexual significance of his name note the use of the root in Gen. 26:8. In the same classification of religious conven- tions the visit of the "angel" to Manoah's wife, the yosheveth, is to be placed (Judg. 13:9; see W. C. Graham, AJSL, XLVII, 241). Graham suggests that ~~ of Isa. 7:10 ff. is the mother-goddess, the earth, whose offspring, Immanuel or "God-Is-with-Us," bears a name symbolic of the renewed presence of the god at the springtime. 2 I Sam. 2: 22. 3 LXX: Kal ela'iOeJ ei TO KarKa&amp;XvLAa a Ris, KGal gaye T TO) t 7o ,bpS abCTS Kcal 9LE. Cf. Cant. 2:3-6. 4 No satisfactory explanation of the nature of these two children has been given. IN0 =1DO raises a host of unanswerable questions, for Isaiah does not otherwise mention the doctrine of the remnant, and this is singular if he thought it important enough to serve as the name of his son. The Vulgate and LXX read passive participle forms for "f V, not regarding it as a part of the proper name and not interpreting it as a concept of the remnant: LXX, KaraXeOels 'IaaovB; Vulgate, qui derelictus est Jasub. They do have the consonants IN= . The attempt of Duhm, Gray, Mitchell, and others to translate the name "A-Remnant-Will-Repent" is, as J. M. P. Smith has shown (ZA W, XXXIV, 222), unsatisfactory. Dr. Smith changes the text to read ". i. (ibid., p. 223). Cheyne's " s "fgg is another possible reading. I have no definite suggestion beyond noting the possibility that the child may have been named after the analogy of the fertility-cult off- spring, according to which =='1 would be suggestive of the returning fertility-god. For this reason Cheyne's suggestion is appealing. That Isaiah would not hesitate to have such a son and to name him after this fashion is made probable not only by his analogy of the expected offspring *"' @, but also by the fact that he himself apparently resorted to the shrine to have relationships with one of the female attendants, giving the offspring a symbolic name (8: 1-4). There is no reason for supposing that I61=:i is a title of courtesy for the wife of the prophet, for it is used exclusively to designate a professional prophetess (Exod. 15:20; Judg. 4:4; II Kings 22:14; II Chron. 34:22; Neh. 6:14). The argument of Gray that nNO1=7 signifies the wife of the prophet, even as m:* signifies the wife of the king, is weak, for the latter signifies something more than wife of the king, carrying also a "professional" connotation (see Gray, "Isaiah," ICC, p. 144). Skinner ("Isaiah," Cambridge Bible, p. 66) notes the German expression die frau Propheten, but this is without analogy in Hebrew. Taking the text at face value, there is no hint that the prophetess was Isaiah's wife or that he married her. The incident recalls Hos. 3:1 ff., according to which the prophet bought the privilege of exclusive attention to the sacred prostitute. It may be that Isaiah's contract was for the purpose of assuring the name of the expected offspring and providing for its sustenance. As in the case of Samuel, the child would perhaps be left</page><page sequence="16">88 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES Hosea adapts this custom to his own purposes. With the exception of the name of his first child, the names of the children of Hosea are such as to indicate that the usual "11 relationship between Yahweh and Israel no longer exists. Nothing could be more adequate as the name of the offspring of the zonah, the sacred prostitute of the fertility cult, than N'VT .1 -th- might as well serve as the name of the offspring of the divine pair, here preceded by a negative to indicate the severance of the usual relationships between the god and his people.2 'My has much the same connotation. It is significant that when the interpolator of Hos. 2:1 desired to express the antithesis of w/ t6, he wrote "r't"':" .3 ~ has a dual significance, meaning not only "people" but also "lover," with a definite cult connotation, being employed by the maiden of Canticles as a designation of the youth.4 The symbolism comparable to that of the Madonna with the infant Jesus appears frequently in the fertility-cult concepts.' Two examples of this occur in Hosea, in both of which the symbolism is adapted to Yahwism. Yahweh is represented as teaching his son Ephraim to walk and carrying him in his arms.6 Another reference may be translated: at the shrine. The situation may be somewhat analogous to that represented in the con- tract tablets of the neo-Babylonian and Persian periods, according to which the female Shirkutu, who were dedicated to Ishtar, were hired out by the shrine. It is not certain that they were prostitutes. Their children belonged to the shrine (see R. P. Daugherty, The Shirkutu of Babylonian Deities, pp. 38, 39, 50, 51). 1 "God-sows" (Hos. 1:4). 2 This root is used exclusively of relationships between God and men. Cf.

In this connection the name H' y is significant (Num. 34:20; II Sam. 9:4, 5; 17:27, etc.). The same divine title, ~ , appears in the proper names 1~~J ~n , "iitY , $i3yP, and "IT"1Y (see II Sam. 13:37; I Chron. 27:6; Exod. 6:23; Num. 1:12, etc.). A profusion of such images is found throughout the Near East. The most prominent are those of Isis and Horus, the prototype of the Mary and Jesus Madonna representations (see Cartwright, op. cit., p. 183). An image of the mother-goddess with suckling child was found at Ashur (see O. Reuther, Die Innenstadt von Babylon, p. 29). A description of the Sumerian goddess Ninkhursag reads: "Her left breast is open; in her left [hand] she carries a child sucking her left [breast]; with the right she blesses" (Poebel, Historical Texts [University Museum], p. 33). 6 Hos. 11:3. The text here is obviously corrupt, but the reconstruction of the versions is as obviously correct. The Vulgate very significantly reads: "Et ego quasi nutriius Ephraim portabam eos in brachiis meis."</page><page sequence="17">THE FERTILITY CULT IN HOSEA 89 "And I was to them as they who lift a babe upon their bosom. I inclined to them and caused [them] to eat."' Two other Old Testa- ment passages contain the same conception. Cant. 8:1 presents the cult imagery of the mother with suckling child, and in Num. 11:12 we read: "Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth a suck- ling child."2 The zonah was a distinctly religious prostitute, sanctioned by the religious conventions of the day, and she apparently personified the goddess in the cult rites. Not only did the king and queen participate in these rites as god and goddess, but the sacred harlots assumed the same r61le.3 The consort of the female sacred prostitute was known as her lover, and the term .M'I. was a technical designation of the sacred male prostitute.4 Hosea distinguishes the lovers from Yahweh himself by the fact that Yahweh was the first husband of the zonah.5 That they represent the fertility-god is further shown when the zonah is described as unaware that her products come from Yahweh, think- ing that her lovers gave them to her.6 The term 2n1 may have become a technical designation of the deity, comparable to %'?T, for in connection with the cult there was a tDR " ',, described by Zechariah as the place where the ritual lacerations took place.7 1 Hos. 11:4b.

Atmu, Fledgling, in the Old Testament," JBLit., XXXIV, 81). 2 The difficulty of interpreting the masculine Yahwism in terms of the feminine-cult symbolism appears here in an almost ludicrous aspect. 3 Ps. 45 represents the marriage of the king as god. David may have received his name from participation in the divine marriage rites as Dod. A similar origin may be assumed for Solomon's name, ~ (II Sam. 12:25). A similar significance may be attached to njwi~ i, the name of Josiah's mother (II Kings 22:1). Cf. the phrase ?1" f in the title of Ps. 45. The annual marriages of the king as God may have been one of the causes of the large harems of the kings. For a discussion of David as Dod see Godbey, op. cit., p. 253. See Frazer, op. cit., pp. 16 ff., for a discussion of divine Hebrew kings; also J. M. P. Smith, AJSL, XXXIX, 37. The concept of the divinity of kings was well known to the Phoenicians and Canaanites of the Tell-el-Amarna period. Rib-Addi of Gebal professes to fall at the feet of the king of Egypt, whom he calls "the king, my lord, my god, my sun" (a-na Aipi Aarri bili-ia ili-ia Aamsi-ia, etc.). This is the common formula (see H. Winckler, The Tell-el-Amarna Letters, Nos. 47, 48, 49, 64, 79, 128, 147, etc.). A native ruler, Mil-ki-li ("The-King-Is-God"?), is to be noted in this connection. Contrast this with Ilu-milki, a messenger of A-bi-milki (ibid., Nos. 151, 163). 4 Hos. 2:7ff.; Ezra 16:37ff.; 23:9ff. 5 Hos. 2:9, ~ ~1=11 m . 6 Hos. 2:10; cf.

The bands of prophets in early Israel may have been pro- fessional sacred prostitutes,5 and a similar function may have been performed by the priests.6 Hosea describes the twofold function of the priests as the eating of the common meal and intercourse with the zonoth and qedeshoth.7 The pregnancy of the zonah was doubtless taken as a sign of the favor of the gods.8 The prostitutes went to the shrine seeking "seed of the gods."9 As Dr. Graham suggests, the offspring of the sacred prostitutes were the object of much consideration in Hebrew society.10 1 Deut. 23:18; I Kings 14:24; 15:12; 22:47; II Kings 23:7; Job 35:14. 2 Deut. 23:19. 'D~ are mentioned in the Phoenician inscriptions from Cyprus from the fourth century B.c. in association with the rithr (see Cooke, Text Book of North Semitic Inscriptions, pp. 65-68). 3 The antiquity of the use of the term :1,N1C in near-eastern cults is evidenced in its occurrence in the Sinaitic-Se'irite inscriptions in the expression fl' , , sometimes written rJP n-j'7" (M. Sprengling, The Alphabet: Its Rise and Development from the Sinai Inscriptions, "Oriental Institute Communications," No. XII, pp. 27, 32, 35, 37, 38, 42). Here it does not, of course, necessarily refer to sacred prostitutes. W. C. Graham suggests that the non-sacred prostitutes were called "J"i0, and refers to Ps. 68:7 and Hos. 4:16. 4 See Ezek. 16:30 ff.; Jer. 3:6; Prov. 7:6 ff.; cf. Num. 25:1 if.; Isa. 57:3 ff. "0i rp, T, 1r1, and T were a few of the designations for the female prosti- tute. The identification of the last two is due to Dr. Graham. The Assyrians had many terms to designate the sacred women: entu, zikru, kadishtu, arimtu, etc. (see Woolley, The Sumerians, pp. 106-8; B. A. Brooks, "Some Observations Concerning Ancient Mesopo- tamian Women," AJSL, XXXIX, 187 if.; D. D. Luckenbill, "The Temple Women of the Code of Hammurabi," AJSL, XXXIV, 1 if.). The zonah and the qedeshah are frequently found paralleled in the Old Testament, and the same person is sometimes represented as both (see Gen. 38:22, 24; Hos. 4:14). 5 The prophets are represented by Hosea as acting like the priests, and the general picture recalls the modern dervish (see Hos. 4:5; cf. 9:7). 6 Cf. the activities of the sons of Eli (I Sam. 2:22). 7 Hos. 4:10, 14. 8 This is the obvious interpretation of Hos. 4:10. Harper objects on the ground that offspring were not desired, but there is no hint to that effect. The offspring played a prominent rOle in many of the cult liturgies. Fertility-cult prostitution was not considered so much a prostitution as a temporary marriage, the purpose of which was conception. The prominence of the rOle of the offspring is indicated in Hosea, chaps. 1 and 2; Ezek. 16:20; I Sam. 1:19, etc. See Jastrow, AJSL, XXXIII, 128-30, for the offspring in the Sumerian liturgies. 9 Mal. 2:15. 10 Recent studies have led Dr. Graham to the conclusion, evidence for which will in due course be published, that the fatherless and the widows in whom Deuteronomy shows such interest are cult people, whose life was integrated in the sanctuary, and who were to be dislocated by Josiah's reform.</page><page sequence="19">THE FERTILITY CULT IN HOSEA 91 Apparently the zonah might be married, unmarried, or a widow. Hosea refers to married zonoth.1 It may be that the married zonoth were somewhat less respected than those who were unmarried, for they are most strongly condemned in Hosea, Ezekiel, and Proverbs,2 and their activities are characterized as adultery by Hosea.3 Among the populus, however, it is doubtful if any stigma was attached even to the married zonah, for these objections come chiefly from the prophetic circles. Hannah, Manoah's wife, and the woman at whose house Elisha stayed were married and functioned as sacred prostitutes, but they are not condemned.4 There was a class of professional sacred female prostitutes who made their livelihood through their shrine activities. Such are those described by Ezekiel.' The zonah of Hos. 2:4 ff. depended entirely on her lovers to provide her with the necessities of life.' The zonah was "kept" by her consort.7 1 Hos. 4:14. The zonah of chap. 2 is also represented as a married woman, being the wife of Yahweh. 2 Hos. 2:4; 4:14; Ezek. 16:1 ff.; 23:1 ff.; Prov. 7:19. 3 Hos. 2:4; 4:14. Lucian's description of the sacred prostitutes of Syria does not exclude married women (Strong, op. cit., p. 26). The qadishtu of the Babylonian cult apparently practiced her profession after marriage, although the harimtu did not (Brooks, op. cit., p. 194). Widows may have supported themselves by this means (cf. Gen. 38:1 if.). Among the Chaouia, who preserve today some of the customs of the fertility cults of the ancient Semitic world, only widows and divorced women may function as prostitutes (see M. Gaudry, La Femme chaouia de l'aures, pp. 121, 122). A quotation from Woolley (op. cit., p. 106) will assist in comprehending the function of these women in ancient society: "Attached to every shrine there was a body of women who formed part of the god's household, since by the anthropomorphic beliefs of the time he was credited with human needs, and his temple and its servants were but a replica of the palace and the following of an earthly king. The chief of these women was the bride of the deity. The rest were his concubines and his domestics ..... There were various grades of temple women, but all were prostitutes." 4 The woman in the Elisha incident was acting as a yosheveth (see Graham, AJSL, XLVII, 214). 5 Ezek. 16:1 ft.; 23:1 ft. s Hos. 2:7, 10, 14; cf. 9:1. A study of the root ~=n confirms the opinion that Hosea drew his vocabulary and symbolism from the cult rather than from secular married life. The root appears seventeen times in Canticles and nineteen times in Hosea, whereas the more "nomadic" Amos employs it but once (4:5; it also occurs in the gloss 5:15). Baal is designated as a "loved one" according to Hos. 9:10, where we are to read . , pass. part., with the LXX and most commentators. The zonah is characterized as "beloved of a consort" (Hos. 3:1, 7~ 1 r,= ). In a cult metaphor Jeremiah describes the relationship between Jerusalem and Jeremiah as "bridal love," 'rj j r#N (Jer. 2:2; cf. II Sam. 13:15; Ezek. 16:1 ff.). When the post-Exilic interpolator of Hos. 2:16ff. would designate a similar relationship, he takes his symbolism from the secular realm, employing the figure of the betrothal (Hos. 2:21, TnlS!)). 7 Hos. 4:10, 11.

Ezekiel chides the zonah because she has succumbed to the sensuous aspects of the cult to the extent that she gives ethnan as bribes to secure consorts that she may carry on her licentious practices.10 Hosea lifts a warning finger against the devotees of the cult because they lay more emphasis on the lucrative ethnan than on real devotion to the deity." In the former instance the situa- tion described may represent the poetic license of the prophet who would fit the details of his metaphor to the political situation. That the function of the zonah was the dramatization of the divine marriage is shown by the fact that the ethnan was a bride-price. An interesting parallel appears in the Sumerian rites. When Gudea cele- brated the New Year marriage of Ningirsu and Bau, he made up the bride-price.2 A. study of the etymology of ethnan further reveals it to 1 Hos. 4:13; cf. Isa. 57:7; Jer. 3:6. 2Hos. 4:13; cf. Jer. 3:6, etc. 3 Hos. 9:1; cf. Ruth 3:2. Ruth was functioning as a zonah at the threshing floor (note Ruth 3:7, 8, 13, 14). Boaz presented her with the customary ethnan of grain (3:15). 1"' is a shortened form of J1.7 , and it occurs in Syriac as .,a- ? This is to be compared with f77~t, "beloved," the designation of the maiden of Canticles. Boaz is a name of a deity (cf. I Kings 7:21). In its original form the story of Ruth may have indicated the divine origin of the royal line of the kings of the United Kingdom, David and Solomon. For other references to threshing-floor shrines see Gen. 50:10; Judg. 6:37; II Sam. 6:6; 24:16-21; cf. Deut. 16:13; Isa. 21:10. 4Hos. 2:8 has a vineyard setting (see Judg. 21:19 ff.; Isa. 5:1 ff.; Cant. 2:15; 7:12; 8:11, etc.). 5 Ezek. 16:30, 31; Prov. 7:8.

It is comparable to the Assyrian nudunnu, nudnu, and nudinnu, which signify "dowry."' This is extremely significant in view of Ezek. 16:33, where the ethnan is identified with J-1:. The ethnan was one of the chief means of support of the shrines, and it was probably in part because of this that the legislation of Deu- teronomy which prohibited the presentation of the ethnan as an offer- ing was promulgated, thereby removing from the local sanctuaries the most lucrative source of income.2 Isaiah informs us that the ethnan was not always stored up or hoarded by the zonah, but that it was dedicated to Yahweh, being given over to the attendants at the shrine to provide them with abundant food and stately clothing.3 The finan- cial importance of the ethnan to the shrine may have been one of the reasons for the exaggerated emphasis upon it in Hosea's time.4 Both Herodotus and Lucian are witnesses to the important r61le which the hire of the sacred prostitute played in the temple affairs.5 THE CULT MOOD The fertility cult was a religion of the senses, an aesthetic cult. It was literally a religion of wine, women, and song. The two roots most descriptive of the cult are ?5 and 7;i .6 Even the kings and princes of Hos. 2:10, 11, and 14 are to be compared with this. The bride-price presented by the king would be more pretentious than that of the average male devotee, and may have served as provisions for the common meal in which all the people participated. David's gift to the multitudes of Israel of loaves of bread, eshparim, and raisin-cakes after the New Year ark procession may have been of this nature (II Sam. 6:19). 1 The Assyr. nadanu equals the Heb. nathan. For the Assyrian usage of nudunnu, nudinnu, nudnu see Harper, Letters, No. 336; Strassmaier, Econ. Doc., Nbk., 91, 92, 283. Both these forms and the Hebrew ethnan, ethnah are written with and without the final doubled nun. The form ethnah is therefore to be retained as a legitimate alternative reading of ethnan, and it is not, as Nowack suggests, a scribal error (see Die kleinen Propheten, p. 20). 2 Deut. 23:19. 3 Isa. 23:18. Micah informs us that the images and idols of the shrine were gathered from the ethnan of the zonah (Mic. 1:7). 4 Hos. 9:1. 6 Lucian writes: "The place of hire is open to none but foreigners, and out of the proceeds of these women a sacrifice is paid" (Strong, op. cit., p. 46). In describing the construction of the tomb of Alyattes at Sardis by various classes of people, Herodotus writes: "It appeared on measurement that the portion of the courtesans was the largest. The daughters of the common people in Lydia, one and all, pursue this traffic" (i. 93). There may be another reference to the ethnan in Hos. 8:9.

Intoxicating wines assisted the worshiper in the attainment of spiritual elevation and communion with the god- head.2 At times the feeling ran so high that only the symbolism of the oven at its hottest could adequately express the fervor of the cult exercises.3 Although usually mentioned second in the great fertility- cult trinity of corn, wine, and oil, yet wine seems to have flowed the most freely during the religious services, and that one part of the shrine should have been called "the house of wine" seems quite fitting.4 Eating also played an important r61le in the observance of the rites. It is quite natural that such an agricultural cult should stress the common meal. The people came to the shrines with their flocks and herds, and these were devoured in the great common meal in which the god, priests, and people partook together.5 The share of the god was the fat, which was burned on the altar.6 Bread was eaten at the shrine, and the thought of the necessity of eating it away from the sanctuary in some distant country would have filled the worshipers' hearts with a dread of the "unclean."7 The picture presented by Hosea is not wholly unattractive. The entire life of the people, their thresh- ing floors, and the bread of their mouths were regarded from a re- ligious viewpoint. Before they drank they poured out some of the wine as a libation to their god.8 Whenever they ate meat it was a sacrifice: "Offerings of lamb they sacrifice and flesh they eat."9 Note the parallelism. In their enthusiasm for their religion they increased the number of their altars with their increasing prosperity.1o 1 Hos. 7:3, 5; 8:10. In 7:5 read 1ij1 IM with the LXX and Syriac versions. I translate: "On the day of our king [New Year ?] the princes dance [1in] from the heat of the wine. He [the king] stretches out his hand to scorners when they approach." For ?Jr in this sense see Judg. 21:1; I Sam. 18:6; Exod. 32:19. The versional renditions of 3 as "begin" offer no help in reconstructing the text. Another possible reading is: "By day the princes profane our king by means of the heat of the wine [so that] he stretches out his hand to scorners when they approach." Cf. with this 8:10, which may be read: "The princes profane the king with [the promise of] a little tribute." 2 Hos. 4:11; 7:5. 3 Hos. 7:4, 6. 4 Hos. 2:10; Num. 18:12; Deut. 7:13; 11:14; 12:17; 14:23; Jer. 31:12; Joel 1:7; Hag. 1:11; Neh. 5:11; 10:40, etc.; cf.

They prospered through the in- come of the zonoth. Ezekiel represents the sanctuaries as lavish and luxuriant.' The priests prospered at the expense of the people.2 The picturesqueness of the shrines was enhanced by the colorful attire of the zonoth. They made themselves clothes from the wool and flax given to them as ethnan by their lovers.3 They wore nose-rings, brace- lets, and necklaces as they searched for their lovers.4 Jeremiah admits us to the boudoir of the zonah as she prepares herself for the religious exercises, bedecking herself with scarlet and ornaments of' gold, penciling her eyebrows with stibium, and generally beautifying her- self.5 Not without reason was she called "My Beautiful One" in the liturgy.6 Incense and spices assisted her in her wiles.' She was es- pecially fond of eshishoth, which were apparently sacrificial cakes con- sumed in the common meal at the cult festivals.8 She was distin- guished as a sacred prostitute by her attire.' 1 Ezek. 16:15 ff.; cf. Cant. 1:16, 17. 2 Hos. 4:8; 5:1, 2; 6:9. 3 Hos. 2:11; Ezek. 16:10 ff. 4 Hos. 2:15; Exod. 32:2; Ezek. 16:11 ff.; 23:26; Cant. 7:2. She decorated herself with jewels as a bride (Isa. 61:10). 5 Jer. 4:30, 41. 6 Cant. 2:10, etc. 7 Hos. 2:15; Prov. 7:17; Cant. 4:11; 5:5; 6:2; cf. Hos. 4:13; 11:2. 8 Hos. 3:1; Cant. 2:5. The latter reference, and the distribution of the eshishoth by David according to II Sam. 6:19, has to do with the common meal. Meek identifies these cakes with the sacrificial cakes of Jer. 7:18 and 44:19, which were apparently stamped with an image of the mother-goddess and presented to the queen of heaven. Hosea intimates that they were made from grapes (Hos. 3: 1). Hirschfeld associates the eshishoth with the PB 2 ~on the grounds that both recall the shape of the testicles and would form fitting gifts to a sacred prostitute (Hirschfeld, "The Marriage of Hosea," JAOS, XLVIII, 277). The etymology of eshish or eshishah is dubious. There seems to be no difference in meaning between the masculine and feminine forms. I suggest that there may be some relation to the Assyr. eshshu, to renew, and that these are "cakes of renewal [of life]." Eshishah is perhaps also to be associated with the Assyr. eshsheshu, the nature of which is not entirely clear. It was apparently a type of offering. It is mentioned among a list of objects sent to the sanctuary by the king, and we learn of a silver vessel as a container of the eshsheshu- offering. A bird is sent for the eshsheshu. Certain festival days seem to have been known as the "day of eshs eshu," and occur in the months of Simanu and Adar. Note the follow- ing inscriptions: "l-en na-sab-bu kaspu-(KUBABBAR) sha-nu-u a-na esh-she-e-shu ki-nish-tum it-ti-shu- nu lish-ku-nu" (Clay, "Yale Oriental Series," Vol. III, col. 51).

This is also evidence of the terrible seriousness with which the worshipers took their religion. The virginity of their daughters and the life-blood of their sons were at the disposal of the deity. Ezekiel twice represents human sacrifices in connection with the fertility-cult rites.' Prostitution and the sacrifice of sons and daugh- ters are associated by the Psalmist.2 Jeremiah refers to human sacri- fices on the high places of Baal.3 Hosea quotes a ritual cry of the cultists as they perform their bloody rites: "Sacrifice men! Let them kiss calves!",4 Human sacrifices in the fertility cult are well substantiated from non-Hebrew sources. Frazer suggests that in the early Semitic cult the king of a city often played the r5le of the dying god, suffering death at the hands of his people. This later developed into the custom of burning the god in effigy. An effigy of Melcarth of Tyre was burned yearly.5 At the Sed festival in Egypt the king was identified with Osiris, posing as the dead Osiris enwrapped in tight bandages. Frazer suggests that originally the king was actually killed.6 Langdon sug- gests that Tammuz was not originally represented as the divine son who perished beneath the waves, but rather as a human king who was slain. Although it is doubtful if this was true of the Sumerian Damu, Langdon seems to be correct in seeing in a liturgy of the cult at Isin a reminiscence of a prehistoric custom of slaying the king as a god. In this liturgy the kings are spoken of as those that sleep, and they may 1 Ezek. 16:20-22; 23:37. 2 Ps. 106:37-39. 3 Jer. 32:35. Further evidence of human sacrifice in the cult is to be found in Lev. 18:21; Deut. 18:10; II Kings 16:3; 21:6, etc. It may be hinted in Prov. 7:26, 27. 4 LXX and Vulgate clearly interpret this as a reference to human sacrifice, reading the first word as an imperative. The Syriac version follows the Hebrew. Harper objects to this interpretation on the grounds that human sacrifice and calf worship were never com- bined, and human sacrifice did not exist in Israel until the time of Ahaz. Both these reasons are rendered invalid by more modern research. 5 Frazer, op. cit., pp. 84 ff. 6 Ibid., p. 39.</page><page sequence="25">THE FERTILITY CULT IN HOSEA 97 have escaped actual sacrifice by some symbolic act.' A cylinder from Ur discloses a priest with a knife in his upraised hand about to sacri- fice a person, possibly a youth, who has fallen at his feet.2 The actual significance of human sacrifice among the Hebrews in the fertility cult cannot be stated, but it is possible that the victim represented the dying god. THE FESTIVALS It was at the time of harvest that the fertility rites took place on the threshing floors.3 Hosea mentions the feast of booths, also a harvest festival.4 He twice refers to the festival of the new moon, once in con- nection with the Sabbath, and these were probably the two important festivals of each month.5 It was probably at the New Year festival that the people came with their flocks and herds to seek Yahweh.6 "The day of our king" may signify the day of the New Year rites, when the king participated in 1 The liturgy is translated: "The lord Idin-Dagan sleeps, And the gardens of themselves restrain [their growth].

Collection de Clercq; Antiquities assyriennes, I, 18; see P1l. XVIII. A ram depicted beside the head of the priest may represent a substitute, recalling the incident of the sacrifice of Isaac (Gen. 22:13). In connection with this note the figure of a ram caught in a thicket which was discovered at Ur (see Woolley, Ur of the Chaldees, pp. 67, 68). A similar motif appears in the opening monologue in Euripides' play, Iphigenia in Tauris. Bohl (op. cit., pp. 83 ff.) adds to our knowledge of human sacrifice in the fertility cult through his cogent interpretation of the significance of graves at Ur discovered by Woolley in which many people had apparently been murdered and buried with a chief female personage (see C. L. Woolley, "The Royal Tombs of Ur of the Chaldees," Mg, XIX, 5 if.). B6hl suggests that these tombs indicate a wedding feast of Nannar with a hierodule or priestess, after which the priestess and her attendants are killed, as a sacrifice to the god to secure fertility from the inundating waters. The sacrifices cannot symbolize the dying god, and there is no evidence that Nannar was thought of as such, so Bihl's explanation is plausible. Cf. the interpretation by Sidney Smith, "Assyrian Notes: A Babylonian Fertility Cult," JRAS, 1929, pp. 849-68. 3 Hos. 9:1; cf. Ruth 2:1 ff. 4 Hos. 12:10.

Two references to "07 leave us in the dark as to whether pilgrimages or dances are meant, but the refer- ence is probably to those festivals in which there were sacred dances.2 This survey of the fertility cult as revealed in Hosea is far from complete, but the author hopes that enough has been said so that, in spite of the inevitable misinterpretations, it is obvious that the popu- lar cult, in rather minute details, is reflected not only in the Book of Hosea, but also throughout the Old Testament. The deity of the people was the dying god, whose resurrection was celebrated in the marriage rites. The popular religion of the Hebrews was a nature cult, in which the natural instincts of men and women found rather full expression. It had many aspects, such as prostitution and human sacrifice, which are repugnant to the modern mind, but which, when seen in their proper perspective, evidence a serious devotion to the ideal which shames our modern sophisticated religious attitudes. This study reveals a further important fact. The prophets did not merely react against the cult, but they took bodily from it many of their highest ideals and most of their significant symbolism. The doc- trine of immortality, certain aspects of the conception of the coming messianic kingdom, the concept of the suffering servant, and the ideal of the fatherhood of God are contributions of the cult. The following quotation from Hos. 11:1, 3, based on the cult symbolism, represents as developed a religious concept and as deep a mystic insight as ap- pears in sacred literature: When Israel was a child I loved him, And from Egypt I called my son: .... And it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, I took him up in my arms. 1 Hos. 7:5; cf. LXX, Ati tjSpat r&amp; SanXe6ov pi&amp;cv. For this interpretation see E. G.
