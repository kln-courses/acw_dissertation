WHITTAKER University of Virginia LITERAL AND FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE OF GOD One of the most peculiar features of the belief in God is the accompanying claim that God is an indescribable mystery, an object of faith but never an object of knowledge. In certain contexts - in worship, for example - this claim undoubtedly serves a useful purpose; and so I do not want to dismiss the idea altogether. But when pious remarks about the ineffable nature of God are taken out of context and turned into philosophy, the result is usually an epistemological muddle. The trouble, of course, is that those who insist on God's mysteriousness still manage to say all sorts of things about him; he is an incorporeal spirit, he created the world, he loves his creatures, and so on. To assert these things is to presume some understanding of God, but no understanding is possible if God is completely incomprehensible. So if that is how it is, if the object of religious belief is utterly incomprehensible, then it makes no sense to say - or believe - anything about God. This problem is nothing new; theologians have been trying to resolve the apparent inconsistency of describing an indescribable object for centuries. And their general strategy is well established. God as he is in himself (God a se) must be distinguished from God as he appears in human understanding (God pro nobis). Or, to put the same idea in another way, God as he might be literally described must be distinguished from our figurative representations of him. Given this distinction, one can defend the language of faith by saying that it contains no literal descriptions of God and therefore presumes no actual knowledge of God in himself. All such language is figurative; it describes God as he is depicted in human understanding but it does not describe God in himself, at least not directly. Instead, it refers to the actual nature of God only in an oblique way; and while these oblique descriptions of God enable the believer to resign himself in trust and gratitude to the object of his faith, they do not reduce the mystery of that object. The language of faith never directly captures its object, so to speak; and so the mystery remains. Religious thinkers have developed this line of defence in prodigious detail, but it is still philosophically suspect.1 For the most serious difficulty appears before the elaborations begin. The elaborations depend on the given distinction between literal descriptions of God, which depict God as he is in 1 See for example, Robert Coburn, 'The Hiddenness of God and Some Barmecidal God Surrogates', Journal of Philosophy, LVII (October/November I960), 689-7.I I 0034-4I25/8i/2828-3290 $01.50 () I98I Cambridge University Press</page><page sequence="2">40 JOHN H. WHITTAKER himself, and non-literal descriptions, which depict God indirectly as he appears in human understanding. But how is this distinction to be given? To deny the literal truth of anthropomorphic descriptions of God, one'needs some understanding of what these descriptions are supposed to refer to; otherwise, one could never know whether they apply indirectly to their object or not at all. How else is the figurative character of religious language to be recognized? And how else is the distinction between God in himself and God in human understanding to be maintained. One needs some understanding of God simply to make these distinctions. But if God in himself is unknowable, how is this understanding possible? That is the difficulty which casts its shadow over all language of God. Because this difficulty applies to every version of the literal/figurative distinction, it undercuts all party-disputes about the symbolic workings of religious language. All those who claim to know that religious language of God is not to be taken literally need to explain how they know. Those who say that this language operates metaphorically need to explain how the tenor of what is truly said of God can be distinguished from the vehicle by which it is said. And those who say that such language operates analogically must explain how they know where the limitations of their analogies lie. In either case one needs to know enough about God to see wlhat might or might not be truly said of him. For no meaningful distinctions can be drawn where there are no differences to mark out; and if we cannot know enough about God to tell the difference between his true nature and figurative representations of it, then we cannot invest any version of the literal/non-literal distinction with any sense. If the incomprehensibility clause can be dropped from theology, so that believers may claim some understanding of God's nature, then this problem might be solved. But as long as the incomprehensibility of God must be retained in the account, the putative distinction between literal and figurative descriptions of God will be hard to redeem. There are two standard ways of trying to salvage this distinction, neither of which, I think, is adequate. One of these, the 'metaphysical view', belongs almost entirely to Judeo-Christian theology. the other, the 'experiential view', also plays an important role in theology; but it seems to have assumed a greater role in the methodological assumptions of comparative religion, where the object of religious language is defined more generally as the 'numinous' or as the 'transcendent'. In the place of these common views I would like to suggest a third alternative, which for the lack of any better word could be called a 'practical view'. This practical view, though, is likely to seem reductive, since it has very little to do with the ontological foundations of religious belief. So before arguing for a practical view of religious understanding, I would like to show how inadequate the other two views are, despite their ontological dimensions.</page><page sequence="3">LITERAL AND FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE OF GOD 4I I The Metaphysical View. Inasmuch as every meaningful distinction requires some possible means of discrimination to back it up, the distinction between literal and figurative descriptions of God requires some kind of religious understanding to justify its use. There is no escape from this point of logic. Believers have to be allowed some understanding of what they are talking about when they are talking about God, and therefore the pious assertion of God's incomprehensibility has to be qualified. The trick is to qualify this assertion without altogether denying its point; and this, in effect, is what the metaphysical solution does. It promises a limited knowledge of God, just enough to justify the distinction between God in himself and God as he is figuratively depicted, but no more. According to the metaphysical view, 'reason' provides this knowledge of God. Reason leads us intellectually to the existence of God through speculative, metaphysical, inquiries; but owing to the limitations of these inquiries, the rational knowledge of God remains too abstract to comprehend the fullness of his being. We know only that there must exist a being with certain intellectually determined properties, but we know nothing more about this being, nothing specific enough to enable us to form a definite conception of its nature. On this view, therefore, the mystery of God is not seriously compromised, since the little that we can know rationally about God leaves so much more of his nature unknown. What we do know tells us how much we don't know, and that is all that it takes to recognize the literal inadequacy of the language of faith. The simplest objection to such accounts is to say that we can either know God or that we cannot. But this objection is obviously too simple in view of the compromise which the metaphysical solution offers. It suggests that God can be known in some respects but not in all respects, and that the respects in which he can be known are too insignificant to annul the mystery of his being. Thus, the crux of the matter concerns the limitations of metaphysical understanding. This sounds like a big topic; but the relevant points, I think, are fairly simple. Presumably, the limitations of metaphysical knowledge follow from the way in which it is generated. Metaphysical realities are never known through direct acquaintance; they are postulates, and we discover their properties by deducing them from rational requirements which must be met if we are to explain various given facts of experience. In metaphysical speculation, in other words, we draw up a bill of explanation, and then we simply postulate something to fill the bill (under the restraints of being systematic). Since these bills of explanation represent general requirements, drawn up in accordance with general requirements of reason (such as the principle of sufficient</page><page sequence="4">42 JOHN H. WHITTAKER reason), the postulates which fulfil them are themselves general. These postulates never have the myriad of concrete characteristics which objects of experience have. The only thing which we can say about them is what we have to say in order to explain how various things which we know in more direct ways are possible. Metaphysical objects, therefore, are necessarily ' abstract'; we never know them as striking features of our experience which need to be explained, we know them only as explanatory constructs. They are 'transcendental' in the technical sense, and our knowledge of them extends no further than our understanding of what reason requires in its transcendental adventures. The familiar proofs for the existence of God are good examples of this kind of argument. We start with something whose possibility seems to require an explanation, and then we postulate something to fill the bill, something which we call 'God'. We want to know how contingent existence, for example, is possible; and so we postulate a necessary being to ground the great chain of-contingent things. Or we want to know how the marvellous adaptation of means to ends in nature could have come about, and so we postulate a designer to do the job. Or we want to know how relative judgments of perfection and imperfection are possible, if nothing we know is perfect; and so we install a model of all perfections in a metaphysical bureau of standards. In each of these cases we call our postulates 'God', but the only properties which we can safely ascribe to these postulated beings are the' properties which they must have to satisfy the explanatory requirements set forth in the premises of our arguments. Every other property which we smuggle into our conclusions by using the word 'God' is logically unjustified. All that we can say about these metaphysical Gods is that they must have whatever it takes to give us our explanations. Beyond that, there is nothing more which we can say about their nature. Yet a limitation like this is just what one needs to preserve the doctrine of God's incomprehensibility. Metaphysical arguments disclose only a-few very general properties of God, while every concrete facet of his nature remains unknown. This seems to offer a plausible solution to the problem of talking about a being which defies literal description. The metaphysically deduced attributes of God, I suppose, must be taken literally. But once this concession is made, the limited understanding to which we are entitled by reason -might give us all the knowledge we need to see that various other descriptions of God, particularly anthropomorphic descriptions, cannot be taken literally. For if we know on metaphysical grounds that God must be infinite or pefect, then we can be sure than the finite and imperfect traits which are ascribed to him in religious discourse cannot characterize his true nature. We need not know in any concrete experiential sense what God's infinite or perfect nature amounts to, since we can never have that kind of acquaintance with a transcendental postulate. But we might know enough</page><page sequence="5">LITERAL AND FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE OF GOD 43 to realize that anthropomorphic predicates can only apply to God in some indirect, figurative, sense. Attractive as this metaphysical view may be, however, it faces too many difficulties to pass as an acceptable account of religious understanding. For one thing, the soundness of the 'proofs' is notoriously debatable; and for another, believers who know little or nothing of metaphysics often resist literal interpretations of anthropomorphic accounts of God just as skilfully as philosophers do. But these are the least of the objections which can be raised against this view. For even if we grant the soundness of the metaphysical arguments, and even if we assume that every astute believer has an implicitly metaphysical understanding of God, there are other crucial assumptions that we need not make. How do we know, for example, that there is more to know of God than we learn from these proofs? We take it for granted that God, if he could be directly encountered, would turn out to have qualities far richer and more glorious than anything which we could possibly anticipate. Just as human beings whom we know only by description turn out to be more concrete and highly defined than we expect, we think that the same must be true of God. He too must have much more to his nature than the few attributes which we can rationally deduce; but as long as we are unable to know God 'face to face', his actual nature must remain hidden. And yet how can we be sure that there is anything more to God than what the proofs tell us? This may be one of those illicit assumptions which we read into the proofs by using the word 'God' to stand for their conclusions. After all, we capitalize this word and use personal pronouns in its place, all of which makes it look like a proper name. It makes it look, that is, as if the postulates required by the proofs had to be entities of some sort, the sort which can be named. Thus, even if we carefully avoid all the other anthropomorphic associations of the word 'God', which spill over into theistic arguments from Biblical contexts, we are apt to think that the God of the proofs must be some kind of being, a being like a human being only much greater. But that no more follows from the proofs themselves than the conclusion that God must be a spatio-temporal being, or a male, or a heavenly king. The proofs tell us only that we must postulate something to satisfy a bill of explanation; and that something, as long as it does that, could be anything. Indeed, I see no reason why the metaphysical God of the traditional proofs could not be an abstract entity, like a mathematical entity or a moment of time or a Platonic form. Unlike concrete beings, which can (in principle) be encountered in experience, abstract beings can only be known conceptually according to their definitive properties. Or to put it another way, the definitive features of an abstract being exhaust its nature, so that there is nothing more to know about it once these features are known; whereas the identifying features of something concrete never exhaust its nature. Knowledge by</page><page sequence="6">44 JOHN H. WHITTAKER acquaintance always adds something to concrete things which knowledge by description doesn't provide. Thus - and this is the important point - if God is an abstract entity, metaphysical arguments might tell us all that there is to know about him. His postulated properties might be his only properties, so that the mysteriousness of his nature would disappear as soon as these properties were deduced. To insist that God is not abstract in this sense, to say that there is more to his being than metaphysical arguments reveal, is to presume something which these arguments do not justify. It suggests that one already has some knowledge of God prior to that provided by the proofs for his existence - in which case the original difficulty recurs. How can one know God well enough to know what kind of being he is, if his natuye is unknowable? The same problem arises when one identifies the metaphysical 'God of the philosophers' (the postulates of the proofs) with the 'God of religion' (the object of faith). Here theologians often treat metaphysical claims about God as if these claims had to satisfy certain conditions for being claims about the true God. In the argument from design, for example, nothing prevents the 'designer' of the natural world from being a plural entity, a committee. But mQst theologians would reject this possibility out of hand, presumably because they already know that God - i.e., the true God - is a unitary being. But again, how do they know that? They must have some knowledge of God either to identify him with or to distinguish him from various metaphysical postulates, otherwise they couldn't make any judgments at all about their God and the God of the philosophers. Faith seeking understanding, then, evidently begins with some of its own. Where does it come from, and how can it exist without abrogating God's incomprehensibility? Metaphysical arguments cannot provide this kind of understanding if they presuppose it. II The Experiential View. The more difficult it becomes to account for this presupposed knowledge of God, the more tempting it becomes to solve the problem by appealing to revelation. But the resort to revelation doesn't solve the problem; for it doesn't explain how it is possible for God to be known and yet unknown, revealed and yet concealed in mystery. It simply suggests that religious understanding comes from a source other than ourselves, through powers other than our own. And that doesn't explain the limitations which must exist in religious understanding, if its object is to remain a mystery. The appeal to revelation, though, does suggest the other standard view of this matter, the experiential view. For if God reveals himself in experience, the limitations of experiential understanding might be cited as the reasons for the partial nature of religious understanding. Experience might link us</page><page sequence="7">LITERAL AND FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE OF GOD 45 to God, enabling a vivifying spiritual current to come across the connection; but it might not permit any information about God's nature to be transmitted. Being shocked out of normal consciousness, we might feel the presence of something supremely, wonderfully, different; and yet we might not be able to describe that presence. In fact, we might realize that no words could possibly describe it. That would hardly dissolve the mystery of God's presence, but it would tell us all that we need to know to recognize the figurative nature of attempted descriptions. The experience of God, in other words, might give us a pre-verbal understanding which is sufficient for applying the literal/figurative distinction to language of God, but insufficient for revoking the claim that God is unknowable. Being indescribable, the experience of God might never be convertible into articulate, verbally communicable, understanding - and in that sense never convertible into knowledge. Thus, the mystery of God might be preserved on one level, while religious understanding might be fed on another. If one has the patience for it, one can find endless repetitions and variations on this theme. But the variations do not matter as much as the underlying idea that religious experience provides a limited form of understanding. On the surface, this seems quite plausible. One who has a religious experience (or a ' numinous' experience) presumably knows what he wants to describe. He may not in fact be able to describe it, but he certainly can be aware of something that he would describe if he only could. He can know what he wants to describe well enough, that is, to see that his efforts at description fall short. Thus, there must be two kinds of experiential understanding; one in which we can identify and describe that which we experience, and one in which we cannot. And the experience of God might provide only the latter variety, so that the believer's knowledge of God could extend no further than the awareness of something which defies description. God would be 'comprehensible', then, in a pre-verbal sense but conceptually incompre hensible. That is the argument. Like the previous view, however, this one sounds better than it is. It suggests that every believer who understands the figurative nature of God-talk derives his understanding from ineffable experiences; and that, I think, is unlikely. Nevertheless, it is possible; and so I would rather press another objection. The one I have in mind concerns a dubious assumption about language and its inherent limitations. On the experiential view, the experience of God is so different from other experiences that the stock of descriptive predicates which language provides for these other experiences proves hopelessly inadequate for this one. Owing to the extraordinary nature of its object, the experience of God is unique; whereas our descriptive categories are inevitably general, being generated out of common experience. Nothing that one could say about the experience of God could capture its</page><page sequence="8">46 JOHN H. WHITTAKER uniqueness or convey the extraordinary presence which one feels in this experience. At best, one could only bend some adjectives into figurative uses, hoping to adumbrate the experience through oblique references to its nearest relations. The whole case for saying that God can be experientially known without being comprehensible rests on this point. And yet the central assumption about language seems almost certainly false. To see what I mean, consider a simpler example. Suppose that one is given some strange piece of food to taste for the first time, some sen-sen, for example. Since this is likely to be a new experience, unique to this individual, he may not be able to describe it. He might try to do so, of course; but he is apt to feel that his descriptions only approximate his new experience. Perhaps he says, 'it tastes like soap, only sweeter; yet it isn't exactly sweet either, more pungent than sweet - no, more aromatic than pungent', and so on. None of these descriptions will seem adequate, and to express their inadequacy the taster might qualify everything he says by warning us against literal interpretations. He might say that his descriptions are only analogies, or that they are metaphorical, or that they are only indirectly indicative of what he is trying to describe. That is, he might say the same things of his experience that religious believers say of the experience of God. But it would be overdoing it to say that such a new sense experience is incomprehensible or unknowable. Any new sense experience is difficult to describe, or to 'convey in words'; one always needs to have the experience to realize what the descriptions intend to convey and to appreciate their inadequacy as substitutes for the experience itself. One could call this feature of sense experience 'ineffability' or 'incomprehensibility' if he likes; but if that is all these terms mean, then their use in relation to religious experience would be innocuous. After all, sense exeriences can be labelled; and given these identifying terms, people can talk about their experiences very effectively. Not only can they identify a peculiar taste, such as the taste of sen-sen, they can also use a term like 'sen-sen' for descriptive purposes - for example, by saying of some other tastes that they resemble the taste of sen-sen. The use of a term like 'sen-sen', once it is established, is no less literal than the use of other terms for other sensible qualities, such as colour. We learn the meaning of colour terms in connection with colour experiences; and once we learn the referring uses of these terms, we can speak directly of our experience. In this sense, language is quite adequate for our purposes. I see no reason why the same consideration should not apply to the experience of God. Granted that this is not a perceptual experience, and granted that it is unique, the difficulty of describing it by comparing it to other experiences should not prevent the possibility of identifying it by a referring term. One may not be able to do this by fiat, as if one could est ablish such a term on the spot. But a referring term could be conventionally established. The peculiarity of religious experience should not have anything</page><page sequence="9">LITERAL AND FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE OF GOD 47 to do with this possibility. As long as the experience of God -or any experience - occurs often enough and widely enough to permit a common usage to develop, words can be instituted to refer to it. That, in fact, has already happened in the case of numinous experience. Rudolf Otto complained about the impossibility of describing such experience, warning us that the descriptions which he did offer should not be taken literally.1 But once he gave the experience a name, others began to refer to it directly, simply as 'numinous experience'. Now the term has a common use; it seems to be quite descriptive, and people seem to know very well what it means. If, therefore, numinous experience, or the experience of God, is any more ineffable or incomprehensible than sense experience, something other than its initial indescribability needs to be cited to explain the difference. For the same relationship which holds between perceptual experiences and the terms which we use to identify them also holds between non-perceptual experiences and the terms which we use to refer to them. In either case our terminology requires some personal experience as a condition for its understanding, but that hardly makes the experiences themselves ineffable. It simply points out a general feature of any immediate experience. Perhaps the experience which we call 'the experience of God' is different, though. Perhaps that experience augurs more than the mere reference to it could ever indicate. If that is how it is, then this experience could point beyond itself to something unexperienced, unavailable, and unknown, as if the immediate experience were merely the manifestation of a greater reality. Theologically, it would be convenient to say that this is the case, that religious experience does convey the penumbra of a greater reality. But one cannot guarantee this feature of religious experience simply by building it into the account. Some epistemological assurances are needed. If we could be sure that the experience which believers refer to as an 'experience of God' does testify to the presence of a transcendent reality, then this experiential view of religious understanding would not be so problematic. For then we could be sure that the understanding which comes from knowing what ' the experience of God' refers to would be a partial understanding of what we encounter in such an experience. We could know that there is something more to be known than the experience reveals, yet something known only to us in experience; and that would give us some reason to speak of this 'something more' as a mystery. But this is precisely where the perennial problems of religious epistemology arise. How do we know that there is anything more to religious experience than feelings and impressions? How do we know that there is something behind these experiences, something undisclosed and unknown? Here the reasons for saying that God is an incomprehensible mystery depend on reasons for thinking that God exists. The existence of God - i.e. of a transcendent reality - does not follow from 1 Rudolf Otto, The Idea of the Holy (Oxford; Oxford University Press, I 950), ch. II, pp. 5-7, and passim.</page><page sequence="10">48 JOHN H. WHITTAKER religious experience itself. The assumption that there must exist some reality behind a numinous experience simply reflects an unexamined mental habit. Since most of our experiences, particularly our sense experiences, generally depend on objects of experience, we tend to think that all experience must conform to the same transitive rule: experience takes an object. Thus, when we have one experience - for example, when we taste something - we generally have this experience by virtue of something which permits additional experiences - colour-impressions, tactile sensations, and so on. One such experience indicates the possibility of others, all from the same source, the object of experience. The more habituated we become to the expectation of further experience, guaranteed by objects of experience, the easier it is to read this expectation into religious experience. The fact that there is no object present in such experience doesn't cancel this expectation; people simply assume that the object must be hidden. So they take the peculiarly non perceptual experience which they do undergo as the sign of other possible experiences which they might have, if only the object of this experience were not so remote. The penumbra of greater reality that surrounds the 'experience of God' may amount to nothing more than this, the habitual expectation that one experience entails a source of other possible experiences. And the supposed mystery of God may simply be the recognition that this source never fulfils this expectation. We experience only one facet of God, so to speak; but we assume, unwittingly, that there are other facets. We assume too much. Some non-perceptual experiences have no objects. Feelings, moods, premonitions, forebodings, and other emotional experiences often arise without any identifiable objects serving as their source. These states of mind may have causes, of course; but they need not be tied to objects which one can experience in various other ways, as one can experience objects of perception. Religious experience may be no different, despite the fact that we speak of such experience as if it did have an object, namely God. And therefore the appeal to experience as an explanation of the limitations of religious understanding ultimately begs the question. For we don't know that experience partially reveals an unexhausted mystery unless we already know that the experience in question comes from an objective ground in a hidden reality. The experiential view of religious understanding trades on this assumption, but it does not justify it. Apparently faith supplies the knowledge that there is more to God than we know by experience. But how? That is the original problem. III The Practical View. The problem is serious. The language of faith plainly requires some understanding of its subject matter, but that understanding evidently precedes metaphysical speculation and conditions the interpreta</page><page sequence="11">LITERAL AND FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE OF GOD 49 tion of experience. Unless the possibility of this understanding can be explained, and unless it can be reconciled with traditional claims about the unknowable nature of God, the philosophical suspicions which surround theology are likely to increase. If the traditional explanations are too problematic, the whole subject may need to be re-examined. I think that it does. One needs no metaphysical knowledge of a necessary postulate nor any experiential knowledge of a transcendent reality to understand religious teachings about God. The trouble with both of these views is that they portray religious understanding as something which depends on some epistemological access to the referent of the word 'God', whereas the notion of the referent or 'object' to which this term refers is entirely dependent on a prior understanding of its meaningful use. Just as one must know how to use numbers before trying to delineate the properties of their referents - if they have referents - one knows what can be sensibly said of God before saying anything about an object to which this term might refer. In both cases the way in which referents are defined reflects a prior understanding of the constraints which govern the meaningful use of the terms involved. So the difficulty is not one of explaining how the referent of the word 'God' can be known and yet remain unknown; the problem runs deeper than that. The difficulty is to explain the prior understanding whereby we know the difference between sense and nonsense in talk of God. This kind of understanding consists in seeing the point of what is to be said and believed about God. To have this understanding one must know what it would mean to abide by a religious teaching, to bring one's thinking and living under its rule and to form one's cares and concerns in accordance with its implications. Such understanding is largely a practical matter. Instead of a theoretical knowledge of a metaphysical being, gained through an intellectual inquiry, it represents a working knowledge of truths to live by. And instead of an extraordinary experience of a transcendent reality, it reflects an ability to deal meaningfully with the garden varieties of human experience. This lesser form of understanding needs no apology, though. A working understanding of God - i.e., of teachings about God - is just what faith requires to retain its epistemological modesty. For this kind of under standing is sufficient for the recognition of figurative language but insufficient for the pronouncement of metaphysical claims. Indeed, it solves the problem of reconciling the knowledge which faith presumes with the knowledge which it disclaims. The solution, in fact, is fairly simple. Once the point of a religious claim is understood, one can see what interpretations of its meaning are to the point or beside the point. Those that are beside the point can be censured as literal readings of figurative' expressions. The ability to make such judgments requires no metaphysical knowledge of God; it requires only enough</page><page sequence="12">50 JOHN H. WHITTAKER understanding to tell when someone's treatment of a religious belief misses its intent. Since the words used to formulate religious beliefs bear many associations in other contexts where they are put to other uses, they invite all sorts of extraneous implications into the specialized context of discussing God, where only a few of these implications are appropriate. Consequently, such beliefs need to be protected from misinterpretation. Their points are easily missed. To get the point of a religious belief, one needs to see how its role as a truth to live by narrows the range of its proper implications. The words of a belief, taken by themselves, leave these implications unfocused; and that is why one cannot determine the point of a religious belief by looking up the words of the belief in a dictionary. The meanings of these words are obviously important; but when we use the words to say something- to make a point - the sense of what we say also depends on the context at hand. If an assertion appears against a background of unstated assumptions, for example, it accrues various implications from the conjunction of the various beliefs i.nvolved. But that is true of any kind of assertion, whereas religious claims take on their implications in more subtle ways. Their point, in the sense in which I am using the term, is not a derived implication produced by an accidental contextual setting. Nor is it an ulterior end which the utterance or the adoption of the belief might promote. The point of a religious belief, or of any other regulative belief, consists of its normal implications in its proper context. Or to put it another way, the point of a religious belief consists of those implications which the proper role of the belief pares down and normalizes. Thus an assertion acquires a point in this sense whenever it acquires a normative role in some proper context of concerns, or whenever it has a regulative function in shaping a believer's pattern of judgment. Missing the point of a belief is a matter of missing this normative aspect of its sense. Proverbs, for example, have this kind of normative aspect. They play regulative roles as guideposts of practical wisdom, and this gives them their point. We may not realize how thoroughly these beliefs depend on their role in a proper context of concerns, simply because we almost always learn proverbs in their proper context. But if one ignores all such restraints, one can see how easily the points of familiar proverbs disappear. Consider these, for example: 'time waits for no man', 'the pen is mightier than the sword', 'a rolling stone gathers no moss'. If one takes these assertions literally, as if all the associations which their wording brings to mind were appropriate to their sense, one could generate a tiresome series of pointless questions. How long does time wait? Where is the best place to stab an enemy with a pen? And why aren't the stones in the desert covered with moss? These questions are beside the point because they have nothing to do with the practical guidance which the proverbs are meant to supply. The concerns which such</page><page sequence="13">LITERAL AND FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE OF GOD 5I questions reflect bear no relation to the proverbs' proper contexts, and they show no understanding of their regulative roles in those contexts. One who understands the contextual ties and regulative uses of proverbs can see that they are figures of speech. He may not be able to explain exactly how these figures of speech work, but he can certainly see that their points are apt to be misunderstood if they are taken out of context. And that is enough to justify a warning against their literal, or unrestricted, interpret ation. One can issue this kind of warning, moreoever, without presuming any kind of theoretical knowledge or extraordinary experience. The only understanding which is needed here comes from the practical knowledge of knowing how to follow a proverb, knowing where and when to apply it, knowing what is to be gained by it, and so on. One who knows this understands the point of the proverb, and that is all that he needs to invoke the literal/figurative distinction in defence of its proper interpretation. The same holds true of religious beliefs. The claim that God watches over us, that he hears our prayers, that he knows our hearts, that he forgives our sins - even the claim that he created the world - all these teachings serve as truths to live by, and all promise a kind of practical proverbial wisdom. Each, in other words, has a role to play in shaping the thoughts and attitudes and judgments of those who believe in them; and therefore each has a point. To understand these teachings, and to keep one's judgments about them to the point, one must understand what it would mean to conform to them. When this is not understood, the attempt to affirm them degenerates into a pointless form of mere assent. The crucial dispositional changes which faith requires no longer accompany belief, and the practical capacities promised by religious understanding never develop. Yet if one does understand the point of these teachings, so that he knows what it would mean to adhere to them as regulative beliefs, then he can affirm them in the manner their logical status requires: he can believe in them by abiding by them. One who understands the point of religious teachings can also see where others go wrong in misinterpreting them. He can see that the inferences they draw, the questions they raise, and the contexts in which they apply these beliefs lead away from the practical intent of these claims. And seeing that, he can see that the point of such beliefs needs to be protected from misunderstanding. No prior, more 'cognitive' understanding of God is required; this kind of working knowledge of the point of various beliefs about God supplies all the insight one needs to see that such claims cannot be taken literally. The realization that beliefs about God are figurative or symbolic is simply a matter of knowing that the apparent or possible implications of these beliefs are not all appropriate, that only some of the practical implications of affirming them are to the point. And one can know that by knowing how to think and to live in 'god-fearing' ways. The practical wisdom of this kind of knowing consists of capacities. One</page><page sequence="14">52 JOHN H. WHITTAKER develops such capacities by learning to use religious concepts and learning to abide by religious principles; one does not derive it from purely intellectual conclusions about God or from extraordinary experiences of something which we are unable to describe. Rather, believers must rely on their practical understanding in order to use metaphysical arguments as handmaidens to their faith, or to absorb their experiences into a meaningful pattern of life. This understanding is the kind which theology ultimately requires; and yet it is a modest form of understanding because there is no direct way to convert it into theoretical knowledge of metaphysical realities. In that sense God remains a mystery for religious believers, despite their practical under standing. The wisdom gained from language of God does not advance the frontiers of any science, empirical or philosophical. It does not reveal any new objects in the universe and does not provide any independent information about a metaphysical postulate. That is the kind of extra knowledge which faith in its modesty need not pretend to possess. Now I know that this account of religious understanding will sound reductive to some, precisely because it seems to discount the ontological side of religious belief. But the idea that religious belief needs an ontology to go with it is partly a matter of thinking that terms like 'God' must have entity like referents, and that assumption is as theologically troublesome as it is philosophically dubious. Beyond this, the reason for insisting on some ontological foundation of religious belief is to assure the possible truth of religious assertions by giving them something to be true about. Before closing, therefore, I would like to suggest, however briefly, that religious claims do not have to be ontological or metaphysical assertions to be truth claims. We tend to think that the practical truths of religious belief must rest on prior truths about what there is in the universe, but sometimes our thinking moves in just the opposite direction - we postulate certain items of the world's furniture because we already feel certain of some practical truths. One last example might show what I mean. Socrates, Plato tells us, spent the last few hours of his life discussing the immortality of the soul, presumably a metaphysical question. But when he had defended the belief in immortality against the objections of Simmias and Cebes, he began to speak more generally of heaven and earth and of the habitations of the soul.' The earth, he said, hangs in the midst of the heavens, appearing as a magnificant ball of many colours, purple and gold and white. But it is pock-marked with great depressions in its surface where the heavier vapours gather and where the mist turns to water and runs into seas. On the outer surface nothing is subject to these decaying vapours, and the inhabitants of those higher regions breathe health from the ether, which is to them what air is to us. There the very stones are like gems, and the gods actually dwell in their temples. Yet far below great rivers of fire and mud 1 Plato, Phaedo, Io8E ff.</page><page sequence="15">LITERAL AND FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE OF GOD 53 oscillate beneath the ground. And those who live in the cavities of the earth, as we do, are taken to one of these great rivers when they die. And there, if their souls have not been informed by virtuous aspirations, they are swept downward to the Acherusian Lake, where they dwell until they are ready to be carried back into the region of their former existence. Those whose souls are formed by base desires, though, are carried beyond the lake into lower regions where they suffer in one way or another until their souls are improved. Only those few who have tended their souls by fixing their passions on goodness and justice and truth ascend to the surface of the earth, where they live forever in an uncorrupted setting too beautiful to describe. When he had finished Socrates conversed a few moments longer with his friends, and then he began to prepare himself for his execution. But before he left to take his bath, he paused to advise those to whom he had recounted his vision. Of course, no reasonable man ought to insist that the facts are exactly as I have described them. But that either this or something very like it is a true account of our souls and their future habitations - since we have clear evidence that the soul is immortal - this, I think, is both a reasonable contention and a belief worth risking; for the risk is a noble one. We should use such accounts to inspire ourselves with confidence, and that is why I have already drawn out my tale so long.' Socrates might just as well have said that his account should not be taken literally. Yet it was not because he knew what the earth was really like that he warned his friends against attending rigidly to the details of his vision. He wanted to inspire his friends with confidence as they were reminded of their own mortality, and he didn't want to be misunderstood. He had a point to make, and it did not lie in matters of detail. Was his point that the soul is indestructible? Was that the truth that he wanted to communicate as he went to his death? Was that his wisdom? On the surface that is how the dialogue reads; the key point seems to be the 'belief worth risking', the belief that the soul is immortal. And yet there is something of deeper importance here, something so profoundly important to Socrates that the argument for the soul's immortality must be understood as a vehicle for this deeper insight. For the bare fact of the soul's immortality, the metaphysical claim, does not inspire us with confidence. The inspiration comes from the thought that those who have lived virtuous and single-hearted lives have nothing to fear, despite the fact that they must die. That is the point of Socrates's cosmological vision, and it is also the point of believing in the soul's immortality. Thus, he argued for the soul's immortality because he felt confident that there was some truth in it, just as he felt confident that there was some truth in his cosmological vision. But the truth which he saw in both, the truth worth venturing, was not anything which these teachings I Phaedo, I I4D (I am following Hugh Tredennick's translation in The Last Days of Socrates (Baltimore; Penguin Books, I 954), p. 178.</page><page sequence="16">54 JOHN H. WHITTAKER assert when one ignores their point and attends only to their literal sense - i.e. to the bare possibility of surviving death or to the particular details of one's future habitation. That truth lies in the larger implication which Socrates wanted to invest in the question of immortality and which he tried to bring out in the vision which consumated his teaching. One who outfits himself with goodness and courage and generosity, whatever the travails of his soul might be, has nothing to fear in life or in death. If this is true, it is not a metaphysical truth to be discovered in abstract arguments but a profound proverbial truth. The teaching which conveys it looks like a metaphysical claim about an abstract entity, the soul, and a non-empirical reality, the afterlife. But when arguments about these meta physical matters lead away from the point of believing in immortality, then someone with the wisdom of Socrates should warn us against taking these ideas too literally. And if one should be concerned that such 'fundamental' questions of metaphysics are being relegated to a secondary status, then he should be assured that we need not and should not expect to know any truths more profound than the truth by which Socrates lived and died - that a good man cannot be harmed. Religious beliefs about God may not have quite the same point; but if they have any truth in them at all, their truth need not belong to any other domain of understanding. It is no shame for religions to promise only truths to live by. The important thing is for these truths to be reliable, and for their points to be understood. With wisdom of that kind faith can afford to be modest about its ontological claims.</page></plain_text>
