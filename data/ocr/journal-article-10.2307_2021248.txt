Traduit de 1 'allemand par Jean-Paul Wurtz. Prefface d 'A. De Waelhens. Louvain: Publications Universitaires; Paris: Descl6e De Brouwer, 1953. xiv, 257 p. (Bibliotheque philosophique de Louvain, 13.) The aim of this book is to elucidate the concepts of a science of being, or metaphysics, and to uphold a rational psychology as distinct from empirical psychology. The judgments of em- pirical psychology, the author says, tell us nothing about the spiritual soul or consciousness. Either they relate to behavior solely or to the conditions alnd circumstances of the occurrence of consciousness. The areat mistake of the ilntrospective psy- chologists is their contention that they are talking about con- sciousness. Actually they have been concerned almost exclusively with sensations and images and have failed to recognize, with St. Thomas, that sensing proceeds not from the selnses but from the perceiving subject. The author cites the experiments of Auguste Michotte in which subjects put causal and even anthropomorphic interpretations on the movement of tiny squares and circles rela- tive to each other. Here, as in other examples offered, sensinig is not just sensing. The criticism of empirical psychology does nlot seem to be justi- fied today. Ego-involvement in perception is now an old story and even the introspectionists had their apperception, determining tend- encies, Aufgabe, ete. The author would like to see empirical psy- chology devote itself to a study of the process whereby a man inte- grates himself into family and sex life, and adjusts himself to work, profession, scholarship, and religion, and leave the fundamental problems to metaphysics or philosophical psychology. He makes, however, almost no reference to the clinical literature which is now so rapidly expanding. In developing his philosophical psychology in various direc- tions, Dr. Strasser's main interest is to establish a number of a priori relations between the self and the world, and the self and itself. The conclusions reached are in close accord with the teach- ings of St. Thomas, but the method is usually that of Husserl. As the Editor of the Cartesianische Meditationen und Pariser Vor- trdge and a worker in the Archives-Husserl, the author has an en- viable familiarity with the philosophy of Husserl and is able to quote on occasion manuscripts not yet edited. He nevertheless feels obliged to disagree with Husserl in a number of respects. He rejects the phenomenological reductioln, which excludes from experience all "positions" as to transcendent realities, because this</page><page sequence="2">328 THE JOURANAL OF PHIILOSOPHY supposedly presuppositionless seience maclkes unjustified assuiiip- tions. For exaimiple, it assumiies that the vJecit (das Erlebte) does not appear by way of represeuitation, but is given as absolute, and Dr. Strasser coimiplaiu-s that the pheniomneniological facts are quite otherwise. An experienee that appear-ed threateniing to mle yester- day, he poiuits out, may appear laughable to miie today. Inimiuanent contents of conseiouisness thus have their moodes of appearing-, in this ease, affeetive miiocies. He goes o0n to argue that an Erlcbnis remains the samiie nlot in spite of but becautse it perpetually changres its form, anid beeause its affeetive tone is eontillually being, trains- formed (p. 91). Dr. Strasser 's eritieism does niot seemi very weig,hty. In the first place, it is not Erlebnisse themselves which are fearful or lauohable, but only the intentional objects. But it is more im- portant to note that Husserl imakes it clear in. the seetion of the Ideent to which Strasser refers (? 44) that, though Erlebnisse are giveen and absolute, this meanis onily that they are knlowni in an essentially different way than things are. Perecived things are necessarily presenited to us through appearalnces, representations (Abschattungen). A eoin, for example, is manifested by a system of ellipses of sizes, shapes, eolors, ete., whieh vary reoularly and can be predicted, whereas an Erlebnis sueh as the perceiving itself is not manifested or shadowed forth but is simply there in con- sciousness. This does not mean, of course, that an Erlebnis is fully exposed to view and that mistakes about it are impossible. Husserl states that in fact it is impossible to grasp Erlebnisse coni- pletely and that their unity, as they swim by, has to be seized in retention or memory. It seems pretty clear, however, that any mistake we may make as to whether we are perceiving at all, or any doubt or suspicion we may have on the subject, will be of a different order than the common mistakes, doubts, or suspicions with regard to things. Dr. Strasser's view that the difference be- tween perceiving Erlebnisse and things is only one of degree tends to transform the Erlebnis into a thing. Husserl's transcendental idealism is also rejected by Strasser, one reason being that it entails a split of the self into two in- compatible selves, the transcendental observer who constitutes the world and the worldly self which is constituted by it. The first would seem to be inexperienceable, the second, not a subject which experiences anything. The situation does not seem to be as bad as he makes out. The transcendental subject can be glimpsed in retention and by reflec- tion, and there is no clear contradiction in maintaining that the worldly self (on the level of science and common sense), which is</page><page sequence="3">BOOKA REVIEWVS 329 being constituted, though it is not of course aware of the fact, is identical with the self which is doing the constituting. Any tbleory of the self has to admit that a man niay carry out function.s of which his focal consciousness is not aware, alnd manly of these func- tions may be shared with thle species. In. this sense there is no contradiction in Husserl's declaration that while meni miust die the transcendental life continues indefinitely. Strasser, however, ob- jects strenuously to the telndency ever since Averroes to set up a ''universal spirit" above the individual self or soul. The onaly excuse seems to be that the functions shared by the species are riot individual functions. There is nothing personal about the factb that the visual field has a certain unity and that succession is viewed under the category of causality. Dr. Strasser, in short, seems to reject both the transcendental reduction and the transcendental idealism for the weaker reasons, and to neglect the stronger ones. He cdoes lnot exploit, for example, the advantage of his own realism over the transcendental and, in the end, absolute idealism of Husserl. This is regrettable because the view that the self partially coinstitutes itself and the world has the backing of the findings of empirical psychology, whereas the theory that the transcendental subject "creates" the self and the world has no such support. With a strong interest in maintaining a clear-cut unity of the self, the author is critical of the dualism and "trialism" which appear in modern philosophy. Ile points out that, for Rickert, the subject, since it can never become object, can only be con- ceived as a limit. Both Rickert and Scheler fail to unify body, soul, and spirit, and thus leave the self dismembered. In expounding his own view Dr. Strasser wisely begins with the phenomenological fact that we experience ourselves as the author of our own thoughts and actions, which does not of course imply that we are the cause or the sole cause of them. In the case of emotions and actions such as fear and walking, which are "quasi- objects" of the self, we say "I fear" and "I walk," and not "My viscera fear " and " My legs walk." We glimpse the I indirectly in these experiences, for fearing and walking are given as what I do. Even automatic processes such as the beating of my heart are presented as mine, though they are also at a distance like noises on the street, and the self is given very "mediately." At the other extreme.are intellections and volitions, where we are most directly aware of ourselves, but the awareness is still incomplete and medi- ated by the things thought and willed. To demand direct, unmediated awareness of the self is to ask for an infinite regress of awarelness, and is also absurd in itself.</page><page sequence="4">330 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY The author states that an intentional act of my "lumiere interi- eure" directed upon itself would be impossible. Perhaps what he means by "impossible" could be explained by James' metaphor. One could say the searchlight discloses not only the objects in its path but also itself. However, the light can never reveal only it- self. Having an awareness of yourself in which the self is "the- matic," to use Husserl's expression, just can't be done. My body, Strasser says, is not an object nor a system of objects, but always a quasi-object. Utilizing Gabriel Marcel's key distinc- tion, Strasser gives the body a status between le"tre and l'avoir. Thus one might say: I do not have a body because I am one, and I am not a body because I have a body. Language does not have the right word for the relation. More positively, the author con- cludes that "my body is the extension of my I thrusting (jaillais- sant) in the direction of the world" (p. 103). "I exist primor- dially as a spiritual ego, and I exist also in my body. I am a soul and I am also the matter which I animate in an immediate manner. Thus I am a duality, a multiplicity, and at the same time a unity- a person incarnated" (p. 154). He agrees with Maurice Merleau- Ponty that the incarnation is not a historical fact but is "accom- plished at each instant in the movement of existence " (pp. 155- 156). The intricate, oblique, episodic manner in which the author seeks to establish the auto-subsistence, simplicity, and unique efficacy of the soul, cannot perhaps be plausibly described in brief space. He points out that the contents of consciousness appear to adapt themselves and to reorganize as the result of a "spiritual impulsion." There is no doubt that the I often seems to be the cause and the sole cause of our thoughts and actions, and Socrates' master-slave simile reported common experience. But it does not follow that "under the influence of a new spiritual impulsion the contents of consciousness . . . must be modified, changed in dis- position and reorganized." Nor does it follow that "my conscious- ness of spiritual necessities is not due to an activity of my body, but rather my body is the incarnation of my activity of compre- hending" (pp. 172-173). The incarnation theory in some form may well be true, but empirical evidence will be required to prove that it is. Any adequate theory would have to acknowledge at the beginning the role of the brain in maintaining consciousness and the iVtegration of the self. It is perhaps worth mentioning that Merleau-Ponty, in his Phe'nome'nologie de la Perception, gives con- siderable attention to cerebral functions and pathological disturb- ances, and yet puts up a creditable argument for extreme causal efficacy on the part of the self.</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 331 Dr. Strasser is, of course, well aware of Kant's arguments in the paralogisms of pure reason, and makes some efforts to cope with them. His main answer seems to be that Kant merely showed that the substantiality of the soul could not be established empirically, which he (Strasser) readily concedes. But Kant's further con- tention that if it can not be established empirically, then not at all, is scarcely dealt with. From a methodological point of view the most serious criticism of this subtle and resourceful book is that it pointedly excludes all types of evidence except that of lonely and precarious introspec- tion. To the present reviewer it would seem that to know whether a non-analytic statement about the soul is a priori necessary, one would have to determine how it was learned-how it came to be accepted. If genetic psychology can offer no empirical explana- tion, then a philosopher might appropriately present his non- empirical version. But if empirical psychology can give a plaus- ible explanation the philosopher's version would appear gratuitous. As if to remove any possibility of conflict of this kind, Dr. Strasser insists that empirical psychology and philosophical psy- chology are not talking about the same thing. The former is either concerned with the particulars of behavior or of consciousness, but not with consciousness itself. By this determination philosophical speculation about the soul is freed from all empirical checks and restraints. V. J. McGILL NEW YORK CITY</page></plain_text>
