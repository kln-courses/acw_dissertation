Literature The publication of Papyrus Bodmer IV' is a great literary event. The editor of the play (Menander's Aoloxhos) and the printing-house of 'La Tribune de Genbve' have earned the gratitude of us all. The volume contains the text (the typography of which is particularly commendable), apparatus criticus, indices nominum et verborum, a brief introduction in English and German, translations in French, German, and English (literal and somewhat pedestrian). Also included is the facsimile (slightly reduced in size) of the manuscript. Arthur Stanley Pease has now published the second volume of his magnum opus, Ciceronis De Natura Deorum;z the first appeared in 1955. Here we have the text of Books II and III together with Fragmenta, with a full apparatus and index. The annotation is abundant and for the most part references are quoted in extenso-a most helpful arrangement which allows the reader to draw his own conclusions 'without needless editorial verbiage'. It was a happy inspiration which prompted Charles Tennyson to publish *Ad Pyrrham,3 a collection of 144 versions of Horace's famous Ode, in 25 languages ranging from English to Hebrew, from Hungarian to Maltese, not to mention Turkish, Russian, and Welsh! During the last years of his life Sir Ronald Storrs accumulated no less than 451 such versions, of which I8 x were in English, though not necessarily the work of English scholars. Nor were they confined to this century; the earliest, in fact, is the 'Tell me, Pyrrha, what fine youth .. .' of William Browne, who wrote in the sixteenth century, and Dr. Barton Holyday ('What spritely Younker amongst Beds of Roses .. .') was his contemporary. Standards vary from the elegance of Milton to one version awarded 'first prize for vulgarity' (could it be Wyndham Lewis's 'Baby, what guy is necking you right now in some alcove? Say, babe, who is that stiff? . . . '?). Hardly less entertaining than the versions is the lively introduction, an essay on the perils and pleasures of translation. Another posthumous work is Roman Literary Portraits.4 The original (in Swedish) was to have been revised by Professor Einar Lfstedt himself, but he did not live to complete the task. His friends saw the essays, the result of some forty years of university lecturing, through the press, and they have now been translated into English-most fortunately, for Lffstedt was not only a fine scholar, but had the ability to express himself simply and clearly; the reader is again and again impressed by the fertility of his imagination, by the obvious interpretation never hitherto put into words. Generally the essays concentrate on the first centuries B.c. and A.D., but the first (The Cultural Legacy of Antiquity) is catholic and the last (Marcus Aurelius and His Age) has links with early Christianity. ** The Latin Josephus5 contains the text of Books I-V of the Antiquities and Blatt hopes to edit the text of VI-XX in a second volume.

The last edition was published by Johannes Frobenius at Basel in 1524. As the Latin version, the work of Cassiodorus and his disciples, became the 'chosen history book of the Middle Ages' (Pierre de Blois mentions Josephus in the same breath as Tacitus, Livy, and Suetonius) the present edition will be welcomed in classical circles: apart from any intrinsic merit as a history, it throws considerable light on medieval philology. F. J. E. Raby has edited The Oxford Book of Medieval Latin Verse' (the previous editing was carried out by Stephen Gaselee). New material (up to about the year 1350) is now included and the book is extensively revised and enlarged. Like Medieval and Modern Greek Poetry it is equipped with notes. Loeb Classical Library Plutarch's *Moralia VII,2 translated by Phillip de Lacy and Benedict Einarson, con- tains inter alia what is probably his most admired philosophical treatise, ITpi -rLiv rrr6 ro0 eEfov PpaSis -rLcpopovvcav (The Divine Vengeance). As is customary in the Loeb Series, each opus is preceded by an introduction and footnotes are plentiful. The second volume of Aelian: On Animals3 (Books VI-XI) is translated by A. F. Scholfield -incidentally, this is the first English translation. Aelian is not read much nowadays, but his work is full of interesting and curious information. Fragments of authors no longer extant are preserved by him-and therein lies his chief value today, but in medieval times the TiEpl 3cjcOv 1516rrllros was regarded as an authority of almost Aris- totelian stature on matters of natural history. The fourteenth volume of Livy4 (the last) is notable mainly for the Summaries (Periochae) of the lost books, mostly found in papyri, and for the fragmenta, but Schlesinger has also included Julii Obse- quentis Ab anno urbis conditae DV prodigiorum liber-an antiquarian's paradise-and a General Index of all the Livy volumes (prepared by Russell M. Geer). The high standard of scholarship and translation which we have come to expect from Loeb books is worthily maintained by these three volumes. Translations Few men can have been so active in translating the Greek poets as Richmond Latti- more. His versions have not been uniformly felicitous, but The Odes of Pindars must be one on which he can look back with genuine satisfaction: the spirit of the original is recaptured quantum fieri potuit. There are brief notes, a glossary, a short introduction; it is a great pity that the otherwise commendable University of Chicago Press could not devise a book-cover less hideous. The format of *BHesiod6 is much more attrac- tive. In fact, both in appearance and in substance it is a prepossessing book. Latti- more's blank verse has rarely been more effective and the rather unusual rhythm of the lines seems peculiarly suited to the "Epya Kait lApat. Richard Wilt has embellished the text by some charming line-drawings and L. himself has supplied genealogical tables and a glossary. Many scholars have interpreted Theocritus-Edmonds, Gow, Higham, Lucas, Trevelyan, to mention only a few-but another verse translation will be welcomed: rrroqvpa waph rropopav 8taKpt-ria.

Clearly A. was not the 'impeccable' poet Longinus would have us believe: tcorr oros 6 Arroc0bvlios v Trois ApyovcTrrats 'oltnr1s. New ground was broken by Hadas in translating Heliodorus.' Underdowne's version appeared as long ago as 1587 and Rowland Smith's effort was unworthy (i855). Hadas himself 'resolutely resisted temptation to take liberties with the Greek-especially by way of compression-for the sake of the English'. Nevertheless, despite concessions to Heliodorus' 'Asianism'-what Hadas calls his 'elaborate formalism'-the English seems natural and unstrained, matching the straightforward simplicity of the Greek. With the publication by the University of Chicago Press of *Euripides IV2 and *Euri- pides V3 the series of Greek tragedies is completed (in nine volumes). The standard of translation throughout the series has been almost invariably good; certainly the conception and fulfilment of the work merit all praise. In these two volumes blank verse is the rule, except for some narrative passages where prose was more effective (Agamemnon's recital of woe, e.g. Iphigenia in Aulis, 50-114). Each play is preceded by a short introduction-in the case of the Bacchae this is not unnaturally somewhat lengthened-and the stage directions are sufficient for most purposes. The Pud- docks4 has been described as a tour deforce and ajeu d'esprit; no doubt it delighted the critical audience at the 1958 Edinburgh International Festival- -rHv ydp d&amp;oiSiv pAAov Tn1KX~EfoVa' ~ vOpcOTrol fi "ns dKov6VTrEcaI vECOT&amp;-r &amp;plrr iW?TlTai. However, one instinctively distrusts a work which is festooned with admiring testi- monials both on dust-cover and in the main body of the text. A version should stand or fall on its merits-besides, K6pOV XEi Kicl lAt. Of course, Douglas Young's Scots is vigorous stuff (Scots is a masculine tongue) and inevitably it exercises a fatal fascination on the Sassenach, but the same effect could have been achieved in Welsh or Irish or any broad county dialect of our own language. All would be funny, all would in their own way do some justice to the topical allusions and the bawdy jokes; none would capture the lyric quality of Aristophanes (in that respect an Englishman and an Australian were probably most successful). Mr. Young is to be congratulated on his modem Frogs, but let us keep a sense of proportion; without the vocabulary (or glos- sary) he has thoughtfully provided, the bulk of The Puddocks would be unintelligible. In fact, the translator has produced a good version in a foreign language-but not so good as that of Benjamin Bickley Rogers in plain English. History The first volume of BSamothraces is a document of no little significance. The purpose of the series is 'to record the results of the excavations undertaken by the Archaeological Research Fund Expedition of New York University, under the direction of Professor Lehmann'. The present book contains the ancient literary sources, quoted in full with English translation, and helpful notes; it deals with the geography of the island, its place in legend and history, and the religious associations of the sanctuary.

To demonstrate the legitimacy of this unknown and to assign to him an accepted floruit would be a triumph. Meanwhile the editor has every reason to be proud of a fine publication. Toynbee's BHellen- ism' is too ill-defined. Like all his books it scintillates, is well stocked with -isms, and it is readable; but the Hellenism he writes about is not Hellenic in the normal sense of the word. He tends to denigrate and belittle. For instance, it is extraordinary that the Funeral Speech is mentioned only incidentally to give time and place to Pericles' notorious advice to women. Pericles, 'the radical politician', is clearly no favourite of Toynbee, but more surprising is the almost total neglect of Thucydides son of Oloros. It is too readily assumed, moreover, that the fifth- and fourth-century Athenian wor- shipped nothing but Man (or anthropomorphic deities)-hence the rather contemp- tuous reference to the Eleusinian Mysteries. Toynbee must be fairer. Sir Leonard Woolley's *BHistory Unearthed2 is a diverting popular introduction to modern archaeological techniques, illustrated profusely (but the publisher's claim that the photographs are 'superb' is extravagant; some are quite second-rate). The author surveys eighteen sites from all parts of the world; rather surprisingly, neither Pompeii nor Herculaneum appears among them. *From the Gracchi to Nero3 is obviously desirable in the schools; some compendious volume embracing this period has long been required. Scullard is successful in his attempt to be concise and at the same time to give valuable hints and incitements to further research in his notes (pp. 381- 434). The Meridian Library has done excellent service in reprinting Dill's fine studies of the Roman Empire.*, s Despite the fact that the original prefaces were written over fifty years ago, they are still indispensable to the sociologist. *B The Great Invasion6 tells the story of Roman aggression and conquest up to the campaigns of Agricola in Scotland (Mons Graupius), with an entertaining excursus on the Roman Army. There are no dull pages. Cottrell knows how to arrest attention-he was a B.B.C. War Correspondent and invasions are no novelty to him-and he insists on the best illustrations. It is a popular work and a good one. Science Three books likely to have far-reaching consequences have been published recently in America. t*BA History of Science. Hellenistic Science and Culture in the Last Three Centuries B.C.7 is the devoted work of George Sarton, who died just after completing what he had planned should be the second of eight or nine volumes, 'to present the growth of science and scientific activity from its earliest beginnings to the present'. Few men could have done so well; few have the breadth of Sarton's interests or the ability to evoke in simple language the achievements of a bygone age, literary and artistic and scientific (in the broadest meaning of the word). 'It occurred to me very early', he writes, 'that one could not live reasonably without science nor gracefully without arts and letters.

I hope to communicate them to the reader and make him feel as I do that Euclid, Herophilos, and Archimedes were as heroic and as necessary to our happiness as Theocritos and Virgil.' To indulge both the humanist and the man of science must of course be a difficult task: 'It is much easier to say in a few words what the Muses and the Parcae are, to justify the phrase Berenice's Hair, or to describe a palimpsest or a pentathlon, than to explain the solution of spherical triangles, the asymptotes or the evolutes of a conic, or the theory of epicycles.' Considering the enormous (indeed, horrendous) mass of material with which he had to struggle, Sarton overcame his obstacles remarkably well and it can be truly said that his work is delight- ful and inspiring, enriched by numerous illustrations (chosen with care and fore- thought). It was typical of him that he should insist on including many principes of the great classics: 'I would be grateful to the reader if he would examine them with attention and sympathy (almost every title-page contains some curious information not given in my own text).' He has set an example which may well inspire others to syn- thesize literae humaniores and the sciences. IBA Source Book in Greek Science ' is a scholarly and catholic selection, fully annotated and frequently illustrated, from Greek and Roman authors over a period of roughly one thousand years. There are disadvantages in 'offering passages abstracted from their context' and the difficulty of drawing an arbitrary line between scientific and philosophical or speculative material had to be faced; Greek magic, superstition, and religion, the pseudo-science of astrology, and theories now known to be ridiculous or even false-all these made the choice of material hard. Again, the Greeks made vast strides in mathematics and astronomy- how far should the editors go in presenting this to the general reader? On the whole, one would say that the representative excerpts are thoroughly invigorating and should lead their audience on to enthusiastic research; like good teachers they should and do inspire. Cohen and Drabkin have divided their sources under nine main headings: mathematics (pp. 1-89); astronomy (90-142); mathematical geography (143-81); physics (182-351); chemistry and chemical technology (352-73); geology and meteoro- logy (374-93); biology (394-466); medicine (467-529); physiological psychology (530-58). A most helpful bibliography and a list of books published since 1948 con- clude the work. Surely the popular fallacy that natural science began with Bacon, Galileo, Descartes, and Copernicus should by now be disposed of for ever. The third book, BGreek and Latin in Scientific Terminology,2 is not merely an exercise in lexicography; it has another serious purpose, to assist the scientists in the heavy burden of finding correct and suitable names and technical terms (especially in the fields of biology and medicine). Hence the sections on pronunciation, synonymy (baldness, atrichia, alopecia, calvities, for example), hybrids, eponyms, and the codes and rules of scientific nomenclature (the latter is most enlightening). The book is, in fact, a thorough examination of the whole problem and, by the way, provides an excellent argument for the claims of Greek to be an international language. The Arts Greifen am Thron,3 the work of the veteran Georg Karo, is a valuable addition to the already vast literature on Cretan Kultur and a fine tribute to the labours of Evans and his fellow archaeologists. Karo's text is generously and beautifully illustrated by over seventy plates, some of which will be new to English readers. I have never seen better photographs of the Palace of Minos; the reproductions of Cretan Plastik, too, in metal, ivory, and pottery are admirably clear.

The former is a comprehensive survey which will undoubtedly prove to be of inestimable worth to classical student and general reader alike. Miss Richter has preferred not to treat the subject as a con- secutive whole, 'continually inter-relating its various branches'; instead, she deals with the arts separately. Thus Architecture (with Building Materials and Methods) and Larger Works of Sculpture (with Sources of Information, Uses, Subjects, Materials, and Techniques) each have their own section (in some I50 pages). There follow sections on statuettes, small reliefs in various materials, decorative metalwork, terra- cotta statuettes and small reliefs, engraved gems, coins, jewellery, paintings and mosaics, pottery and vase-painting, furniture, textiles, glass and glaze, ornament (motifs and compositions-the swastika, palmettes, volutes, lotus flowers, and so on), epigraphy. The author has added a useful bibliography, a tentative chronology of Greek sculptural works (from c. 850 to c. 1oo B.c.) with references to other books and catalogues, and a glossary. The illustrations, to the number of over 5oo, are worthy of the Phaidon Press -summa laus. The revised edition of Attic Red-figured Vases (it was first published in 1946) incorporates new discoveries, particularly in the section dealing with the black glaze. The survey, covering the period c. 530-c. 320 B.c., is well annotated and illustrated by 125 figures, 33 of them drawn from originals or redrawn from other publications by Lindsley F. Hall. The long introduction on technique ensures that the book is self-explanatory. Enrico Paribeni's monograph3 contains nearly 500 illustrations, with a full description of each relic and all necessary references. Although Paribeni restricts the limits of his work (the colossal statue from the Temple of Jupiter Olympius, funerary statues, and some Roman or Hellenistic portrait busts, for example, have been reserved for other publications) this is still a magnum opus. Another production of 'L'Erma' di Bretschneider no less praiseworthy: Divagazioni intorno ad una coppa paesistica del Museo di Alessandria4 is a first-class dissertation on Alexan- drian caelatura with fine plates and adequate notes. Die Kunst der R6mer5 is profusely and magnificently illustrated (in the text). Plastik, Architecture, Painting, and Mosaic are discussed fully, from Etruscan beginnings down to the age of Constantine- a most impressive summary. Finally, Friihchristliche Kunst.6 The clarity and distinction of the plates here are beyond praise. This is the finest work yet produced on the subject; every aspect of artistic endeavour is illustrated (there are reproductions, for example, of woven material, of early manuscripts, even of coins). The scholarly introduc- tion and notes of Wolfgang Volbach and the photographic skill of Max Hirmer (already well known to English readers of Greek Sculpture) have combined to create a masterpiece.

Inevitably his interpretation of Greek social conditions will be coloured by his own ideology-and at times this can be disconcerting-but he is never prosaic. The history of the Greeks is being rewritten and some of the old shibboleths have already been discarded; others may soon have to be. There is, for example, an understandable move to emphasize the influence of the Greek scientists (hence Bonnard's panegyric of Democritus) and Pericles maybe has shed some of his pristine glory. In Bonnard's case it is hardly surprising that Thucydides should be comparatively ignored; nor that the names of Cimon and Nicias are absent from the index; nor that Eleusis is unmen- tioned there; but it is peculiar that a whole chapter should be devoted to Pindar, 'Prince of Poets and Poet of Princes'. The book as a whole is thoroughly entertaining (though it hardly merits the superlatives heaped on it by some reviewers) and the plates are really good. Many non-specialists will be profoundly grateful to A. G. Wood- head for The Study of Greek Inscriptions,' a plain compendium giving all the basic information anyone could require: signs and symbols used by epigraphists; the Greek alphabet in its various manifestations; boustrophedon and stoichedon; classification of inscriptions (with examples); dating, restoration, squeezes, and photographs (with practical advice); inscriptions in the history of Greek Art; epigraphic publications; miscellaneous information (numerals, the ten Cleisthenic tribes and later additions, demes, archons, the calendar). There are four plates (three Athenian decrees and a photograph of a squeeze [early third century A.D.]). Woodhead has produced something really worth while, which might profitably be imitated in other spheres of classical study. Peter Arnott's t*An Introduction to the Greek Theatre2 (with a foreword by H. D. F. Kitto) was written for the general reader, but it can be recommended to all and sundry as a competent and thoughtful treatise, the work of a man who is him- self a classical scholar and a practical man of the theatre. Much that is obscure to non- specialists will be elucidated (the drama bound by convention as opposed to the drama of illusion, for example). He writes convincingly and clearly, with a look over the shoulder at Roman Comedy (in the particular shape of Plautus' Menaechmi) and with an excursion into problems of translation. The final chapter (Ancient and Modern), enlivened by a photograph of the Bradfield Theatre during rehearsal of Oedipus at Colonus, should be read by everyone, for in these days television and radio bring adaptations and revivals of Greek drama into every home: 'the Greek genius reveals itself in the superiority of the originals to their copies' is Arnott's conclusion. **BGreek Philosophy III: The Hellenistic-Roman Period3 is divided into two parts: Book V-Post-Aristotelian Dogmatism and the Sceptical Reaction, and Book VI- The Theological or Theosophical Schools (which carries the reader on to Plotinus and the later Neoplatonists). For the most part the volume consists of excerpts from Greek or Roman authors in the original exemplifying different aspects of philosophical thought. This could lead to some confusion, but de Vogel's marginal 'headings' and his notes (kept to a minimum) are very helpful and indeed make the book easy to handle. The Professor has also taken infinite pains over the two indexes, of names and concepts. A more useful source-book of this genre would be hard to imagine. In his "*Grain-mills and Flour in Classical Antiquity4 L. A. Moritz has accumulated an astonishing mass of evidence. A similar treatise on Weaving Techniques, another peripheral subject, so to speak, might be equally fruitful-however, that is by the way. The truth is that most of us take these things for granted and assume that no significant progress was achieved in such prima facie simple but necessary arts until the Industrial Revolution. Moritz attributes the invention of the rotary mill to some indeterminate period in the last two centuries before Christ. The arguments for and against this occupy the first part of the book (to p. 144); the second is devoted to flour (relying largely on the testimony of Plinius Maior).

The sixty-third volume of **Harvard Studies in Classical Philology' has been dedicated to Werner Jaeger in honour of his seventieth birthday. Essays have been contributed by thirty-one distinguished scholars on a wide variety of themes. The book also includes a complete list of works published by Pro- fessor Jaeger (1911-59) and summaries of dissertations for the degree of Ph.D. (pp. 50o8- 28). **Acta Classica2 (Proceedings of the Classical Association of South Africa) is devoted to Roman Life and Letters, and presented honoris causa to Professor T. J. Haarhoff, who retired recently from the Chair of Classics in the University of the Witwatersrand. Seventeen scholars contribute essays, bearing eloquent testimony to his many interests and the wide circle of his friends. The Journal of Classical Studies3 (vol. vii, 1959) comes from Ky6to University, Japan. The articles, printed in Japanese, are summarized in English. There is a strong Greek flavour: all eight deal with Greek subjects-Linear B, the Poseidon Myth and Susanowo-no Mikoto (his Japanese counterpart), Oedipus, the pre-history of Heracles' &amp;;hol, Book XXIV of the Iliad, Plato's Ideal State, Androtion's Atthis, Lessing's interpretation of Aristotle's definition of 'tragedy'. Nigeria and the Classics' comprises papers read at Ibadan in December 1957, papers which make it clear that an African renaissance is well under way. The sensible, and enthusiastic, remarks of Mr. Harold Guite on Classical Scholar- ship and Classical Teaching are especially encouraging. Addenda Pietro Romanelli's BStoria delle province romane dell' Ajricas is an exhaustive study, concentrating mainly on the Imperial Age (the Republican Period is dealt with in 150 pages). The title of the book is slightly misleading, for Egypt and Cyrenaica are excepted; more accurately it might have been called 'Province dell' Africa romana'. Romanelli has devoted many years to the subject and speaks with authority; he admits, nevertheless, that there are still many difficulties, much that remains even now ob- scure. Praxagoras of Cos, son of Nicarchus, was regarded in antiquity as 'the most famous representative of the Coan School after Hippocrates'. Fritz Steckerl has now collected, edited, and translated not only the fragments of Praxagoras, but also what remains of his disciples, Phylotimus, Plistonicus, and the third of the seven Xenophons mentioned by Diogenes Laertius.6 Steckerl writes: 'This is not intended to be a detailed study of the medical conceptions of Praxagoras. Rather, I want to draw a general outline of what one may call his medical system by fitting together those fragments which will help toward an understanding of his opinions as a whole.' Roughly a third of the book comprises biographical material and a longish essay on P.'s doctrines; the rest is devoted to the testimonia (in Greek or Latin) and their English versions. The Leiden publishers may well take a real pride in the latest edition of Tibullus;7 the clarity of the text and the generous allotment of space to the full apparatus criticus and helpful Latin notes are most praiseworthy. Lenz deals with the codices at considerable length (he makes use of Hamburgensis 'non ignotum, sed ab omnibus fere neglectum') and provides a bibliography, with a list of previous editions from the princeps of 1472 to the Berlin publication of R.

The Greek appears on the left side, German translation on the right. There are some notes and general remarks, but usually the excerpts are left to speak for them- selves. A very diverting volume. Mary Macgregor's books can hardly be called school books, although they are eminently suited to school-children. I would suggest that they are wholly delightful, with enchanting, if rather fanciful, illustrations and that most children up to the Middle School would be pleased to possess them.2, 3 School Books It would be impertinent on my part to assert that this or that book was superior. Schoolmasters are notoriously conservative and will have their own individual criteria. However, in order to help them in some degree, the following abbreviations have been adopted: S signifies that a book is suitable only for mature or sixth form pupils; V that full vocabulary is included; N that there are adequate notes; P that photographs appear; K that there is a Key.

If one may judge by this preview, the book will surpass anything hitherto produced of this kind. The text is the work of scholars; the maps and illustrations are magnificent (it is worthy of note that air photography of classical sites can throw new light on history).
