The finds were discovered during the initial excavations, 1982-1983, and have never been published. Among them there are eleven greenstone beads, a lump of green mineral, three miniature votive axes, two flint axes, one basalt axe, two seashell pendants, two bone tools, fragments of a white-ware bowl, two small obsidian blades and two small clay figurines. Besides a description of the items, we have attempted to relate them to funerary and cult practices according to their archaeological context. Résumé : Cette étude présente une série de pièces importantes découvertes sur le site PPNB de Yiftahel, Israël. Recueillies pendant les premières fouilles, en 1982-1983, elles sont restées inédites. Il s'agit notamment de onze perles en pierre verte, d'un morceau de pierre verte, de modèles réduits de haches votives, de haches en silex et en basalte, de pendentifs en coquillage marin, d'outils en os, de tessons d'un bol en pâte blanche, de petites lames en obsidienne et de deux petites figurines en terre cuite, décrits ci-dessous. Nous nous sommes attachés à les relier aux pratiques funéraires et cultuelles suivant leur contexte archéologique.

The prehistoric site of Yiftahel is located on the eastern bank of the small valley Nahal Yiftahel in the Lower Galilee, Israel. This Neolithic site was first discovered in 1982 dur ing a survey of a prospected highway development. The first excavations were carried out by A. Ronen of the University of Haifa and were followed by M. Lamdan and M. Davis from the Stekelis Museum of Prehistory, Haifa (Lamdan 1983; Lamdan et Davis 1983). Further to the preliminary report by Lamdan and Davis (1983), findings and observations of the two exca vation seasons were recently published in the final report of the three expeditions that conducted excavations at the site of Yiftahel in the 1980s and 1990s (Garfinkel et al. 2012). During 1982-1983, some 80 m2 were excavated and later labeled Area D. Prior to excavations, surface finds were meticulously collected over an area of 302 m2 (Ronen et al. 2012). Area D was selected at the spot of highest den sity of surface finds. The excavations revealed a Middle Pre Pottery Neolithic B layer (MPPNB) with a series of plaster floors and installations, concentrations of botanic remains, animal bones and abundant flint implements. A female skel eton in a flexed position was found in Square J21 with the skull removed (Ronen et al. 2012: 48-56). Recently, the National Treasures Department of the Israel Antiquities Authority cleared the warehouse at the Stekelis Museum of Prehistory in Haifa and several exceptional finds from Area D of Yiftahel were rediscovered. The items were stored at the warehouse of the Museum for 30 years and have never been published except for a few sentences in the preliminary reports. M. Lamdan and M. Davis perhaps selected these finds for further study or for a planned exhibition, but for some reason they were forgotten. These finds included eleven greenstone beads and a lump of green mineral, three min iature votive axes, two seashell pendants, fragments of a white-ware bowl, two small obsidian blades, two small clay figurines, two stone axes, one basalt axe and two bone tools. Here we present these important finds in order to complete the excavation report and to further emphasize the impor tance of the PPNB site of Yiftahel.

THE ARTIFACTS CLAY FIGURINES Two small clay figurines were found in a clear PPNB con text. One is an almost complete anthropomorphic figurine (Square J15; 29 x 16 x 15 mm) (fig. 1: 1; fig. 2: 1). Made of pale brown baked clay of outstanding quality and burnished, the item probably represents a human (female?) headless torso. This figurine is rather unique and no exact parallels were found in other Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites but some of the aspects of this figurine resemble PPNB anthropomorphic figurines at Munhata (Garfinkel 1995: 17-19). The head, arms and legs of the figurine are absent and might be classified as 'pillar figu rine'. However, the body has a barrel shape that narrows on the top and the bottom and may perhaps indicate a bulging abdo men. The upper section of the figurine has some fractures and Paléorient, vol. 40.1, p. 149-158 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2014</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2 -1-2) Clay figurines; 3-4) Miniature votive axes; 5) Green stone beads; 6) Bone pendant; 7) Flint 'Bowlet abrasions and the part of the back is broken. The breasts are portrayed by two punching notches to represent the nipples and by incisions. Two incisions emphasize the chest; one passes underneath the breasts and the other between them and contin ues to the back. The navel was also created by puncturing but the hole is bigger than the chest puncture. At the center of the back, small punctures are visible just at the fracture. Paléorient, vol. 40.1, p. 149-158 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2014 The second figurine, slightly damaged, is also anthropo morphic (Square R21; 28 x 12 x 10 mm) (fig. 1: 2; fig. 2: 2). It is made of dark grey to black clay, probably burnt and has a rough surface. The figurine is in a seated position; arms and genitalia are absent. The head is separated from the rest of the body by a narrow neck; it has an elongated form and a very distinctive pinched nose that resembles a bird's beak. The</page><page sequence="4">152 N. GUBENKO and A. RONEN abdomen is prominent with a navel shown by a delicate punc ture hole. Buttocks were indicated by two small lumps of clay which were added to the back of the figurine. A very similar figurine has been discovered in the PPNA phase (III A) at Mureybet (Syria) and was identified in a report as a female representation (Cauvin 2000: Fig. 8, 4). This figurine is more simplified than the item from Yiftahel, and it also does not exhibit any clear sexual characteristics. Moreover the shape of the body, seated position, and pinched nose are compa rable between two figurines. Another item that resembles figurines mentioned above has been reported from Jericho, probably from PPNB levels (Holland 1983: Fig. 223, 3). This figurine is in a seated position but instead of a head, it has a cylindrical ending with the inner part impressed inward, similar to several geometric items from Munhata (Garfinkel 1995: 23). A number of human figurines from Tell Aswad (de Contenson 1995: Fig. 127, 1,5 and 10) and Tell Ramad (de Contenson 2000: Fig. 100) also share some similar aspects with the Yiftahel figurine, such as the seated position and pinched nose. The stylized rendition of sex in both the Yiftahel figurines is vague. We interpret the first figurine, with some reservation, as a woman's body. This item could also represent a head with emphasized eyes and a mouth. The second figurine we inter pret as a female representation due to its similarity to other sitting figurines reported as 'clearly' female (Cauvin 2000; de Contenson 1995), even though sexual characteristics are absent. On the other hand, this figurine could also represent a combination of human and bird, due to its beak-like nose. GREEN MINERALS Beads Eleven complete beads (fig. 2: 5; fig. 3) and four frag ments were found in 1982 at Area D. All are round 'disk beads' of slightly different sizes (table 1); they are perforated in the center and all but one are made of a pale green min eral. Ten green beads were found together on the plaster floor between Squares FV540 and FW540. Single beads of this type made of green minerals have been reported from numer ous PPNB sites, such as Nahal 'Issaron (Goring-Morris and Gopher 1983), Jericho (Talbot 1983), Nahal Hemar (Bar Yosef and Alon 1988), Yiftahel, Area C (Garfinkel 2012a), Kfar Hahoresh (Bar-Yosef Mayer and Porat 2008), Munhata (Gopher and Orrelle 1995), and 'Ain-Ghazal (Rollefson and Simmons 1986).

Despite the difference in raw material, it is very similar, in shape and drill marks of perforation, to green beads that were found in the PPNB context and may belong to the PPNB. Paléorient, vol. 40.1, p. 149-158 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2014</page><page sequence="5">More from Yiftahel (PPNB), Israel 153 Lump A lump of bright green mineral (fig. 1: 3) was found some distance south of the green beads. The item has amorphous shape with clear cut marks, very similar to the lump from Yiftahel, Area C (Garfinkel 2012a: 209). Miniature Votive Axes Three miniature votive axes were found at Area D (table 1). Two axes have a similar trapezoidal shape and both are made of dark green, almost black, mineral, probably serpentine (fig. 1 : 4-5). One has chipped bit and close to the other end (butt) there is a small round depression, possibly a sign of drilling. The third specimen (fig. 1: 6) is more elongated and thicker than the others. It is made of a layered green mineral that might be serpentine but lighter in color and less polished than other two axes. All three axes have very thin incisions on their body (fig. 2: 3-4); these are presumably traces of use, maybe tying. The same marks can be seen on the small broken axe, possibly made on serpentine, from Munhata (Gopher and Orrelle 1995: 63, 153). Miniature votive axes made of green stone are not common find at PPNB sites in Southern Levant. In addition to the broken item from Munhata, just a few items have been reported: one miniature axe from Kfar Hahoresh (Goring Morris et al. 2008), a hoard of votive axes at Area I, Yiftahel (Khalaily et al. 2008), three at Jericho (Wheeler 1983: 786), and one flat miniature polished axe made of green stone that was a grave good at Atlit Yam (Galili et al. 2005: 9); finally, two greenstone axe-like items were discovered at Horvat Galil (Gopher 1989: 86*). Incised axe This item, made of a black mineral with green spots (most likely serpentine), is slightly polished and chipped on one sur face and on the butt (fig. 1: 7). The shape is of a trapezoidal votive axe with a sharp bit. The item has deep incision on both faces. The deep incision can be explained by secondary use of the axe as a whetstone or a pendant due to value of the exotic mineral. One of the greenstone axe-like objects from Horvat Galil resembles this item by its shape, dimensions, and the incisions on one face (Gopher 1989: Fig. 4, 6). At present the exact kind of the minerals used to produce beads and votive axes from Area D remains to be determined. The green minerals used for bead production from Yiftahel Area C were tested and had been identified as rosasite and malachite. However, more recent analyses identified green minerals as apatite and as chrysocolla (Garfinkel 2012a: 210). Nevertheless, none of these green minerals are found in the immediate vicinity of Yiftahel. Apatite and fluorapatite origi nate in the Hatrurim and Dabba Formation of Israel (Judean Desert). Sources of chrysocolla and malachite are found in the Faynan or Timna copper mine areas, and turquoise is found in the Sinai copper mines near Serabit el-Khadem (Bar-Yosef Mayer and Porat 2008: 8558). However, several PPNB sites were situated much closer to these sources and might be sup pliers of the green minerals and finished goods. For example, lumps and flakes of malachite in addition to large quantities of beads were reported from Beidha, Jordan (Kirkbride 1966: 53). At Nahal Issaron nodules of malachite and artifacts of turquoise were recovered (Goring-Morris and Gopher 1983: 156). The sites Jebel Arqa, Jebel Rabigh, and Jebel Salaqa are located in the Hisma basin, southern Jordan. These three small MPPNB villages provide evidence of workshops where amazonite was extensively worked into disk beads (Fabiano et al. 2004). Currently, we believe that the three miniature axes are made of serpentine. According to reports of votive axes from Kfar Hahoresh (Goring-Morris et al. 2008) and Yiftahel, Area I (Khalaily et al. 2008), it can be suggested that closest source of this rare raw material is on Cyprus or in Northeastern Syria. These axes seem to have been imported from hundreds of kilometers away and seem to have had an important sym bolic meaning. AXES In addition to small votive axes made of rare minerals, the excavation of Area D also provided three axes made of more local stones. Axes made of basalt and limestone are relatively common at PPNB sites such as Munhata (Gopher and Orrelle 1995), Beisamun, Abu Gosh (Lechevallier 1978; Khalaily and Marder 2003), and Yiftahel Area C (Dag et al. 2012: 198). One complete axe is made of basalt (12.7 cm long), polished on the cutting edge, and shows little traces of use (fig. 4: 2). Two other axes are made of material that looks like hard lime stone. However, as a result of XRF analysis it is clear that these two axes are made of white colored flint (Y. Goren, personal, comm.). One axe, found in the pit in the plaster floor, has a nar row, chisel-like cutting edge (8.5 cm long x 3.6 cm width) and is roughly polished on one face. The second flint axe is large (17 cm x 9.5 cm) and polished on the cutting edge (fig. 4: 1). This axe was found broken into four parts but it is not clear whether the fractures were made intentionally, happened dur ing use, or during excavation.

SHELL PENDANTS Two mother-of-pearl pendants are in this category. One is a small oval item with two perforations (fig. 1:9). The second one is a large fractured elongated piece with one perforation (fig. 1: 8). During excavations at Yiftahel a number of different marine and freshwater shells were discovered. Most of them belong to species of Mediterranean origin and were easily collected by inhabitants of Yiftahel, but some came from the Red Sea shore, about 350 km from the site. Several specimens were intentionally perforated (Bar-Yosef and Heller 1987). The provenance of the mother-of-pearl species which two pendants are made of is not identified at the moment. A small number of mother-of-pearl pendants, of different shapes have also been found in PPNB sites such as Nahal Issaron (Goring-Morris and Gopher 1983: 157), Nahal Hemar (Bar-Yosef and Alon 1988), Beisamun (Lechevallier 1978), Ain Ghazal (Rollefson 1984), Ayn Jammam (Rollefson 2005), Jericho (Wheeler 1983: 786).

The spatula (fig. 1: 11) is probably made of an animal rib with smoothed and polished surfaces, the tip pointed. A perforation is present at the base of the item. A similar group of artifacts was reported from Area C of Yiftahel (Garfinkel and Horwitz Kolska 1988: 77). A pendant (fig. 1: 10; fig. 2: 6), or frag ment of bone spatula, has very smooth and polished surfaces, rounded on one end, and is broken just at the perforation. INCISED ITEMS Two different incised items are comprised in this group. One is an incised cortical flake identical to the group of items from Area C (Garfinkel 2012b: 99). The other is a small piece of basalt slab with incised pattern of crossed lines (fig. 4: 3). This kind of item is common in PPNB sites, and an item with almost similar crossed incisions was reported from Beisamun (Lechevallier 1978: 253). FLINT 'BOWLET' It is a well-made circular, dome-shaped item of 10 cm diameter (fig. 2: 7; fig. 4: 4). The concave surface is heavily abraded by battering, probably intentionally to create a rough ened surface. The convex surface was flaked in the manner of a one-sided discoid core to form a rounded shape. The item is broken and has traces of thermal impacts. It is made of flint in the shades of pink and purple, of a very high quality. On the convex surface, the flint is glossy and the colors are black and purple. This curious object was found on the surface during the survey of Area D before excavations. As a result, its precise con text and date are not clear. However, a few very similar items were discovered in PPNB levels at Jericho (Payne 1983: 673), Basta, Ba'ja (Gebel 1999: 12-13), el-Hemmeh (Makarewicz and Goodale 2004: 8) and Wadi Abu Tulayha (Fujii 2009). Thus, the item from Yiftahel Area D may belong to the PPNB. WHITE WARE Two fragments of white ware vessels were discovered in Area D. Both are thick rims of shallow bowls made of lime plaster. A high percentage of these vessels were noted also from Areas A and B (PPNB levels) at Yiftahel (Braun 1997: 123). In the Southern Levant this type of vessel is reported from PPNB and PPNC levels at Ain Ghazal and Ashkelon (Garfinkel and Dag 2008: 200-201). DISCUSSION At the beginning of excavations of Area D, eight test trenches were dug. Test Trench III revealed Neolithic plaster floors and consequently nine squares were opened on either side of the trench. In squares FV540-FW540 on the plaster floor, close to the line of a few large stones, ten discoid beads were found. In Square FV540, next to the beads, a broken bone pendant was unearthed. The main excavation area (Sqs. D-K/14-26) was opened adjacent to the Trench III, although the connection between these two locations is not clear. Additionally, a small area was excavated (Sqs. P-W/21-23) four meters east from the main excavation area. These two areas (fig. 5) partly revealed one or more buildings with several levels of plaster floors and remains of the walls and structures. A female headless skeleton in a flexed position was found in Square J21b and on the border between Squares J21 and K21, and a broken human mandible was also recovered. In close proximity to the burial in Square J20, a pit containing animal bones was found. The pit yielded a high frequency of skeletal associations, including bones of three different species: Gazella, Capra and Bos. An almost complete skull, with maxilla, of a red fox (Vulpes vulpes) was unearthed in Square J21b, and an ulna and a metacarpal of a red fox were found in Square K20 (Horwitz 2012: 274; field notes). At present, the connection between the human burial and the skull of a fox is not very clear, but at the neighboring PPNB site of Kfar Hahoresh it was noted that bones of this species were especially abundant in burial contexts. This may indicate that the fox played a symbolic role in the belief system of Neolithic inhabitants (Horwitz and Goring-Morris 2004). It is most likely that the human burial, the fox remains, and the pit with animal bones in Area D of Yiftahel have also animal human ritual /symbolic associations. One of the miniature votive axes was found in Square J20, in close proximity to the human burial, and could fall into the same ritual/symbolic category. At Yiftahel, in Area I, several green axes were placed close to the burials (Khalaily et al. 2008: 7). At Atlit Yam, a polished green axe was found in a burial (Galili et al. 2005: 9). In addition, the record from the Early PPNB site of Tell Qarassa North (Southern Syria) sug gests that the presence of polished axes is connected with the burials as well (Ibânez et al. 2010).

Schematic plan showing the distribution of some of the finds. Continuing the line of evidence of symbolic behavior at Yiftahel Area D, a second miniature votive axe was discovered within two meters of the burial in Square J17, and in the same row, Square J15, one of the clay figurines was found. The third votive axe was discovered along with the basalt axe (Sq. R23) and within one meter from the mother-of-pearl pendant (Sq. P23). In addition, in Square R21 the second clay figurine was found. The fairly dense scatter of these rare finds indicates that the building partly uncovered in Area D had a role most likely with a public/ritual association. Area D is one of the smallest areas that was excavated at Yiftahel. During 2007-2008 two extended seasons of exca vations were conducted in Area I, which included the for mer Area D. Area I provided several caches of flint, bone tools, a unique cache of small and miniature axes made of green stone, and a very impressive cache of three plastered skulls. Primary and secondary burials were found mainly in this area. Some of the skeletons had their skulls intact; others had their skulls removed post-mortem. In addition, a triple burial was found as well as a few pits with B. primigenius bones in articulation (Khalaily et al. 2008; Milevski et al. 2008). In sum, the unusual artifact assemblage described in this article fits in well with and completes the new finds from Area I (former Area D) related to funerary and cult practices. The finds, such as serpentine axes, two small obsidian blades, artifacts made of green minerals and mother-of-pearl pendants indicate the existence of a rather extensive exchange network and support the claim made by other authors (Garfinkel et al. 2012; Khalaily et al. 2008; Milevski et al. 2008) that Yiftahel was one of the largest and most important MPPNB villages in Northern Israel.
