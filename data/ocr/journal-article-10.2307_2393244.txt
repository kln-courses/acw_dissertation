<plain_text><page sequence="1">Organizations on the Couch: Clinical Perspectives on Organizational Behavior and Change. Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries and Associates. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1991. 408 pp. $34.95. This book is a potpourri of sixteen essays by various authors purportedly brought together to demonstrate "the importance of the clinical paradigm for a more commonsense understanding of organizational functioning" (p. xiv). The apparent theme undergirding the collection of essays is that in developing an explanatory theory of behavior within organizations, there are powerful unconscious determinants that need to be identified and incorporated, since they influence and underlie much conscious and overt action. Having read the essay collection, however, I am not convinced that collectively they either (1) 349/ASQ, June 1994</page><page sequence="2">demonstrate the importance of the clinical paradigm for "a more commonsense understanding of organizational functioning" or (2) provide any particularly new or useful theoretical insights about unconscious processes that could be used to develop a systematic administrative theory and provide a sound theoretical basis for empirical investigation. Within the collection there is a perfunctory examination of both current research and theorizing on unconscious processes in organizations. For example, Kets de Vries states, "In numerous empirical attempts to study organizations, there has been a lack of scientific imagination, a tendency to overlook much of the real data. The intrinsic richness of the material has been lost. In many instances we are left with superficial descriptions that neglect the underlying factors that could help explain managerial and organizational behavior" (p. 1). These rather strong assertions are not supported by any kind of careful systematic analysis and are, in my opinion, unwarranted. There are no references to any of these "numerous empirical attempts." I would like to see some specific examples of these empirical studies that demonstrate "a lack of scientific imagination," "overlook much of the real data," have lost the "intrinsic richness of the material," and constitute "superficial descriptions" that "neglect underlying factors." Only three pages are devoted to explaining what is meant by a "clinical paradigm," a most cursory examination, given the stated purpose of the collection. A careful review of current research on unconscious processes in individuals, in groups, and in organizations would have served a useful function. There is much systematic theorizing and research on unconscious behavior (e.g., Gustafson and Cooper, 1979; Shevrin and Dickman, 1980), but I didn't find it here. Overall, I found the conceptualizations and theoretical articulations for the most part fuzzy, disjointed, and unsystematic. I would have liked the various authors to have made a greater effort to state their thesis carefully by identifying and defining the key variables they were focusing on and then set forth theoretical propositions relating the variables that could be used to guide research. I found the essay by Hirschorn and Young to be an exception, since they articulate quite well how psychological splitting operates as a social defense in thwarting organizational learning. Part of the fuzziness comes from the fact that most of the theoretical conceptualizations presented border on solipsism and reification and reflect a reductionistic, antipositivistic bias. For example, the culture that exists in an organization is viewed as a simple extension of the personality and "neurosis" of the chief executive officer. The great-man theory of leadership is alive and well in such conceptualizing, which ignores recent work in attribution theory within social psychology. This reductionist viewpoint also neglects classic and consistent social psychological findings that there is a social reality (a group effect) that operates outside of social and individual awareness to influence social behavior. Research on social conformity, intergroup dynamics, the 350/ASQ, June 1994</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews self-fulfilling prophecy, obedience to authority, terror management, and social labeling attests to how out-of-awareness and unconscious social forces influence and shape behavior in groups and organizations. There is also a questionable anthropomorphic assumption that organizations can be treated as if they were a human with a personality. This is most evident in the book title: Organizations on the Couch. This anthropomorphic assumption is further reflected in Kets de Vries and Miller's using the DSM-111-R (the official psychiatric diagnostic manual in the U.S.) as an analogy for organization cultures (pp. 243-263). Applying DSM-111-R labels to organizations adds nothing of theoretical substance. Labeling and establishing a typology through analogy is a seriously flawed methodology. The typology presented reminds me of a series of organizational "horoscopes." Aside from the ontological oscillations, Kets de Vries engages in some troublesome and unwarranted "psychologizing." For example, he states, "To prevent disturbing thoughts from coming to the surface, many students of organizational processes find it much safer to operate at a superficial level and stick to the obvious and banal. Moreover, the desire for a 'quick fix' in organizational intervention means that for many people psychodynamic formulations only complicate life, and they do not like the implication that other quick-fix solutions are more often than not completely illusory." I would like to see such wild interpretations grounded in some actual data derived from people in organizations. Such speculative and impressionist analysis does little to improve our understanding of unconscious processes in organizational life. In the concluding essay, Ket de Vries states, "In one way or another, all the contributors to this book can be considered breakers of illusions. By taking the clinical approach to organizational analysis, these management scholars have laid to rest the myth of organizational rationality. Their contributions give us true insights into human nature" (p. 380). Apparently either we didn't read the same set of essays or this is simply an expression of an unfulfilled wish on the part of Kets de Vries. One might hypothesize, instead, that all that has taken place is that these scholars have created their own myths to make sense of what they observe happening in organizations. These scholars may simply be iatrogenically injecting through their interpretation their own myths and illusions of what is really occurring under the surface in organizations. If there are no eyewitnesses to the unconscious process, does that mean it is simply a matter of opinion? I think not. It is to be hoped that a scholar who wants to focus on exploring subjective experiences and unconscious processes and believes the scientific paradigm is too limited will investigate what Burrell and Morgan (1979) referred to as the interpretive paradigm, as well as the radical humanism paradigm. In these alternative paradigms, it is still possible to do systematic theory construction and systematic research on unconscious processes in organizations. 351/ASQ, June 1994</page><page sequence="4">Finally, many of the authors have written articles for professional journals that are similar to the essays that appear in this book. For example, Gilmore and Krantz's (1985) article in Human Relations is virtually identical to the essay they present here, even though they do not reference it. I would have preferred a book of readings taken from professional journals so that "rough drafts" would have gone through a professional review process. In fact, I believe this book makes the case against publishing a set of alleged original essays that have not been subjected to the scrutiny of a professional review process.
