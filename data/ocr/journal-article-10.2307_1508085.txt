<plain_text><page sequence="1">ORIGEN, CELSUS, AND THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY HENRY CHADWICK QUEENS' COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND THERE WERE indeed many respects in which Christianity was objectionable to Celsus. But perhaps no doctrine was so peculiarly nauseating to him as the Jewish-Christian doctrine of the resur- rection of the body. At the beginning of the fifth book of the contra Celsum Origen is dealing with Celsus' attacks on the pride shown by the Jews in supposing that they were the chosen people of God. Celsus is contending that the Jewish belief in angels is merely a manifestation of this (5.6). They believe they have a particularly privileged position in God's sight on the ground of the angelic messengers sent to them by God (cf. 5.41), and this fantastic conceit is equally manifested in their self- centered conception of the resurrection which is nothing more than the outcome of their delusion that they are the center of the universe and that the world was made entirely for their benefit (4-74-99). 1It is in this context that he continues: It is foolish also of them to suppose that, when God applies the fire (like a cook!), all the rest of mankind will be thoroughly burnt up, and that they alone will survive, not merely those who are alive at the time, but also those long dead who will rise up from the earth possessing the same bodies as before. This is simply the hope of worms. For what sort of human soul would have any further desire for a body that has rotted? The fact that this doctrine is not shared by some of you (Jews) and by some Christians shows its utter repulsiveness, and 1 On the connection of thought in the original text of Celsus see a good dis- cussion by A. Wifstrand in Kungl. Humanistiska Vetenskapssamfundets i Lund Arsberattelse 1941-2, at pp. 409-Io0. And for the Jewish-Christian belief that the people of God are the ultimate purpose of the creation and that the world is maintained for them, cf. M. Dibelius on Hermas, Vis. 1.16, in the Ergainzungsband to Lietzmann's Handbuch zum N.T., 1923. My debt should here be expressed to Dr. W. Telfer who kindly read this article in its first draft, and made a number of valuable criticisms of detail and helped to remove some ambiguities.</page><page sequence="2">84 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW that it is both revolting and impossible. For what sort of body, after being entirely corrupted, could return to its original nature and that same first condition which it had before it was dissolved? As they have nothing to say in reply, they escape to a most outrageous refuge by saying that "anything is possible with God." But, indeed, neither can God do what is shameful nor does he desire what is contrary to nature. If you were to desire something abominable in your wickedness, not even God would be able to do this, and you ought not to believe at all that your desire will be fulfilled. For God is not the author of sinful desire, or of disorderly confusion, but of what is naturally just and right. For the soul he might be able to provide an everlasting life; but as Heraclitus says, "corpses ought to be thrown away even more than dung." 2 As for the flesh, which is full of things which it is not even nice to mention, God would neither desire nor be able to make it everlasting contrary to reason. For he himself is the reason of every- thing that exists; therefore he is not able to do anything contrary to reason or to his own character. (5.14). The justification of belief in the resurrection of the body on grounds of divine omnipotence is denied by Origen when he comes to deal with this particular point (5.23); we are well aware, he says, that divine omnipotence does not mean that God can do anything in the sense that it is possible for him to do any- thing incompatible with his divine nature. However, as so fre- quently in the contra Celsum, the evidence of other Christian literature supports Celsus against Origen since there is plenty of evidence that other Christian apologists did use this argu- ment. It is precisely the appeal to divine omnipotence which is made in defence of the resurrection of the body by Clement of Rome (27.2), Justin Martyr (Apol. I.I9), Athenagoras (de Resurr. Mort. 9), Irenaeus (adv. Haer. 5.3.2-3), Tertullian (de Carnis Resurr. 57), and by the Apocalypse of Peter (Ethiopic text).3 Furthermore, it is interesting to notice that when Origen himself is not engaged in defending Christian doctrine from ex- ternal attack, but is criticizing the popular conception of the resurrection as held within the church, he expresses his criticism in terms very close to those used by Celsus. 2 Heraclitus Frag.

H. E. 6.24.2), now lost.4 His doctrine can, however, be recovered from various sources - from his reply to the attack of Celsus which we have quoted, from the important work of Methodius which was primarily intended as a direct attack on Origen's attempt to "spiritualize" the traditional doctrine, and from Jerome (espe- cially Epist. 124.10, and contra Joh. Hier. 25-26). The interest of Epiphanius in the pernicious doctrine of the Alexandrine for- tunately led him to make a considerable quotation from Metho- dius and he has so preserved for us in Greek a substantial section of Origen's commentary on the first psalm, where in interpreting verse 5 ("Therefore the wicked shall not rise up in the judge- ment, nor sinners in the council of the righteous") he appends an extended discussion of his understanding of the matter.5 And it is here that he complains that when the simpliciores are ques- tioned and difficulties are raised "they take refuge in the assertion, All things are possible to God." (KatL /LEra w 7ra;7ra 7 1 optag Err TO o 7ava Evat vvarar1 o 7( OEW^ Ka~rapEvyova-t.) It is evident that Celsus and Origen start from the same pre- suppositions in their approach to the problem; they are agreed that it is quite mistaken to appeal to divine omnipotence in order to justify belief in what seems fantastic. For all this the back- ground is to be found in the debate between the Academy and the Stoa, going back to the time of Carneades in the second cen- tury B.C. The theory and practice of divination was accepted by the Stoics as being a necessary corollary of their doctrine of provi- ' For a catalogue of the surviving fragments cf. A. v.

Origen wrote two books and two dialogues on the resurrection, which were thus reckoned as four books; cf. Rufinus, adv. Hieron. 2.20; Jerome, c. Joh. Hier. 25. It is perhaps worth noting that Preuschen (in Harnack p. 383) gives the wrong reference to Rufinus, and omits the all-important word quarto in his quotation from Jerome (p. 384).

In Cicero, de Divinatione 2.41.86 we learn from the Aca- demic criticism that the Stoics used to appeal to divine omnipo- tence, very much in the same way as the simpliciores of Origen, as a justification of their belief in these remarkable narratives. "Nihil est, inquiunt, quod deus efficere non possit. Utinam sapientis Stoicos effecisset ne omnia cum superstitiosa sollici- tudine et miseria crederent!" Similarly in de Natura Deorum 3.39.92: "Vos enim ipsi dicere soletis nihil esse quod deus efficere non possit, et quidem sine labore ullo; ut enim hominum membra nulla contentione mente ipsa ac voluntate moveantur, sic numine deorum omnia fingi moveri mutarique posse." I hope to show in the course of this article that this is not the only respect in which Origen's discussion of the resurrection has been influenced by the old debates of the Academy and the philo- sophical schools. But it is necessary first to examine Origen's criticism of the popular conception as held in the church. II Origen begins from the basic fact that the nature of o-ra is impermanent; it is in a continual state of change and transforma- tion, caused by the food which is eaten, absorbed by the body, and turned into tissue. This is the point developed by Aglaophon, whom Methodius makes the mouthpiece of Origen's opinions in his dialogue. Matter, he says, is continually in a state of flux and subject to change, like the stream of a river rising and falling, so that it never remains the same even for a short time. When we say the body will rise again, what body do we mean? That of a youth, or of an old man, or of a child? The body is always being changed by the food eaten. And the flesh of a newborn child, or a youth, and of an old man, are different; we change from the flesh we have at first to another flesh, that of a child or a youth, and from this into that of an old man, changing our clothes, as it were, when they are worn out. For though hard and indigestible food is passed out of the stomach, the easily digesti- ble food is formed into flesh, because it is absorbed by the con- tiguous veins which carry the blood. (Methodius 1.9). Paul</page><page sequence="5">ORIGEN, CELSUS, AND RESURRECTION 87 refers to this continual transformation of the body when he says in II Cor. 4.16: "Though our outward man perish, our inward man is renewed day by day" (Methodius 1.12).7 There can be no doubt that the words which Methodius has here put into the mouth of Aglaophon represent very closely Origen's own statement. The whole passage, for example, is an admirable commentary on a parenthetic sentence in Origen's de Oratione 27.8 (where he is not discussing the resurrection at all, but the Platonic and Stoic definitions of ousia): 70TO70 yap 18LO a(TC)(.L(L T)pt, a Tat -q' aL 7) av7)l Kai , 1B 0t/- r Tapa TO ELtaL aiYva pEV(TTcL, 8E6/LEa -o-V V1TTT-q-tp0To0- E1EUoTLO-Lo KaC TPEboTV-S OITEp Eav rTXELOV El) KaCpp EI'tEo't To a'OppEOVTo%, aVlO'(T1 yLVETaU, Eav &amp; E'XaTTOV, /IELOaTL0 Ta a TW 01)3va o X&amp;' o TO' ?T ErTLctLOV Xa/ 3dJvovrca iv aKp'T, v' Oi"'70o EV, " LEW"EL yv 7'a0.

VI, Berlin, 1895.</page><page sequence="6">88 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW 31.15), and Gregory of Nyssa (de Anima et Resurr. Migne, P. G. XLVI. 149 f.).11 Origen's second line of attack is the contention that at death the body returns into its constituent elements, and although the composing elements do not in any sense cease to exist, yet they cannot be put together again in their original form. To para- phrase the words which Methodius puts into the mouth of Proclus (1.14-I5), the body is composed of the four elements, fire, earth, air, and water; and from each of these God took what was required in order to make up the body. When the body dies, it dissolves again into these elements - the watery part again becomes water, the dry part earth, the warm part fire, and the cold part air. This can be illustrated from the natural order. If you take wine or milk or blood, or any liquid which will mix with water, and you pour a certain quantity into the sea; the wine and milk which you have thrown in are not lost in the sense that they have ceased to exist, but it is impossible to recover the quantity thrown into the sea in the separate state. Similarly the actual matter composing human flesh and blood does not stop existing at death, but it cannot again be restored to its former state. Here again that Methodius is closely following Origen's own words is clear from the verbal parallels in Jerome, adv. Joh. Hier. ad Pamm. 25 (M.P.L. XXIII. 376 BC): Quatuor, inquit, elementa sunt, philosophis quoque nota et medicis, de quibus omnes res et corpora humana compacta sunt, terra, aqua, aer, et ignis. Terram in carnibus, aerem in halitu, aquam in humore, ignem in calore intelligi. cum ergo anima caducum hoc frigidumque corpusculum dei iussione dimiserit, paulatim omnia redire ad matrices suas substantias: carnes in terram relabi, halitum in aera misceri, humorem reverti ad abyssos, calorem ad aethera subvolare. et quo- modo si sextarium lactis et vini mittas in pelagus, velisque rursum separare quod mixtum est: vinum quidem et lac quod miseras non perire, non tamen posse quod fusum est separari: sic substantiam carnis et sanguinis non perire quidem in originalibus materiis, non tamen in antiquam redire compaginem, nec posse ex toto eadem esse quae fuerint. "Quotations from the relevant passages are cited by Bonwetsch.</page><page sequence="7">ORIGEN, CELSUS, AND RESURRECTION 89 Thirdly, Origen scores a palpable hit when he asks what will happen to the bodies of people eaten by wild beasts, since, just as the food we eat is absorbed by the veins and becomes part of the constitution of our body, so also men's bodies devoured by animals become part of them: Just as the food which we eat is assimilated into our body and changes its characteristics, so also our bodies are transformed in carnivorous birds and beasts and become parts of their bodies; and again, when their bodies are eaten by men or by other animals, they are changed back again and become the bodies of men or of other animals (Origen ap.

The situation envisaged by Origen is undoubtedly a cogent argu- ment for his view; it was the point which caused most difficulty to Augustine (de Civ. Dei 22.20), and it was urged by pagans against the traditional doctrine in the time of Tertullian (de Carnis Resurrectione 4, p. 30 ed. Kroymann), Athenagoras (de Resurrectione Mortuorum 4), and Tatian (Oratio ad Gr. 6). Celsus nowhere raises this difficulty. But Porphyry certainly did so (ap. Macarius Magnes 4.24, T.U. XXXVII.4, Leipzig, 1911, P. 92): 12 For often many have perished in the sea and their bodies have been consumed by fishes; many have been eaten by beasts and birds. How then can their bodies come back again? Let us briefly examine what we have said. For instance, suppose someone has been shipwrecked, and his body is eaten by mullets; they in turn were caught by some fishermen, who, after eating the fish, were killed and eaten by dogs; and when the dogs died they were completely consumed by crows and vultures. How then will the body of the man who suffered shipwreck be reassembled again after it has been eaten up by so many animals? And again, another has been consumed by fire, and another eaten by worms; how can such return into the existence which they had at first? '"Porphyry, Frag. 94 ed. Harnack, in Abhandlungen der kSnigl. preuss. Akad. d. Wissenschaften, philos. hist. KI., 1916. It is not improbable that Augustine has Porphyry's objections in mind when he defends the resurrection of the flesh in the last book of the De Civitate Dei.</page><page sequence="8">90 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW But you will tell me that this is possible for God. That is not true. For not all things are possible . The rest of Porphyry's criticism follows the line taken by Celsus, which we have discussed above: God is not omnipotent in the sense that he can do what is contrary to his own nature or what is intrinsically impossible; he cannot bring it about that Homer was not a poet, or that twice two, which (as Porphyry kindly notes) make four, should make five. Origen's fourth objection is that if the flesh is to rise again in the same form, then what use is going to be found for its organs? Are we seriously to suppose, he asks, that the wicked are going to be provided with teeth to gnash with? (ap. Method. 1.24). If the simple view of the resurrection is accepted, then risen bodies will have the same needs as earthly bodies; we shall need to eat and drink in the heavenly places (ibid. 1.7); some use will have to be found for our hands and feet (3.7.6-7). Once again Methodius' account of Origen's teaching is sup- ported by Jerome (adv. Joh. Hier. 25, M.P.L. XXIII. 375): Dicit ergo Origenes . . . duplicem errorem versari in ecclesia, nos- trorum et haereticorum: nos simplices et philosarcas dicere, quod eadem ossa, et sanguis, et caro, id est, vultus et membra, totiusque compago corporis resurgatt in novissima die: scilicet ut pedibus ambu- lemus, operemur manibus, videamus oculis, auribus audiamus, circum- feramusque ventrem insatiabilem, et stomachum cibos concoquentem. Consequens autem esse, qui ista credamus, dicere nos quod et come- dendum nobis sit, et bibendum, digerenda stercora, effundendus humor, ducendae uxores, liberi procreandi. quo enim membra genitalia si nuptiae non erunt? quo dentes si cibi non molendi sunt? quo venter et cibi si iuxta apostolum et hic et illi destruentur? ipso iterum cla- mante: Caro et sanguis regnum dei non possidebunt, neque corruptio incorruptionem. haec nos innocentes et rusticos asserit dicere.

Similarly ibid. 26 (378 B): Alioqui si eaedem carnes erunt, et cor- pora quae fuerunt, rursum mares et feminae, rursum nuptiae; viris hirsutum supercilium, barba prolixa; mulieribus laeves genae, et an-</page><page sequence="9">ORIGEN, CELSUS, AND RESURRECTION 91 gusta pectora, ad concipiendos et pariendos fetus venter et femora dilatanda sunt. resurgent etiam infantuli, resurgent et senes; illi nutri- endi, hi baculis sustentandi. In this argument that if the body is to rise again some use must be found for its organs, once again we have a pagan difficulty: Tertullian is aware that this objection is being raised in his time (de Carnis Res. 4, and especially 60): Quo enim iam, inquiunt, spelunca haec oris et dentium statio et gulae lapsus et competum stomachi et alvei gurges et intestinorum perplexa proceritas, cum esui et potui locus non erit? quo huiusmodi membra admittunt subigunt devolvunt dividunt digerunt egerunt? quo manus ipsae et pedes et operarii quique artus, cum victus etiam cura cessabit? quo renes, conscii seminum, et reliqua genitalium utriusque sexus et conceptuum stabula et uberum fontes, discessuro concubitu et fetu et educatu? postremo quo totum corpus, totum scilicet vacaturum? If the fragments on the resurrection ascribed to Justin in the Sacra Parallela are genuine, then the difficulty to thought pre- sented by the notion of the survival of sexual differentiation into the life of the world to come was already being felt in the middle of the second century.13 III What is particularly interesting about this line of thought is the fact that it had a history in the debates of the philosophical schools in the second century B.C. Although the Epicurean denial that the gods have any interest in the world led to that philosophy being regarded as atheistic, it is recognized that in fact Epicurus not only believed in the existence of the gods but formulated a precise theory of their mode of existence.14 In the first place, the existence of the gods is certain (a) because there is a universal belief that they do exist; (b) because in dreams men have visions of the gods. From the latter in particu- lar we learn that the gods have a definite shape, since men see them having a human form. According to the scholiast on SKarl Holl in Texte und Unters. XX, N.F. V, 2 (1899), pp. 38-39. 14 In what follows I am mainly indebted to the masterly chapter in Cyril Bailey, The Greek Atomists and Epicurus (Oxford, 1928) pp. 438-81. Cf. also A.-J. Festugieire, JIpicure et ses Dieux (Paris, 1946).</page><page sequence="10">92 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Diogenes Laertius 10o.139 (Usener, Epicurea frag. 355) Epicurus definitely conceived of the gods as having human form, and the same assertion is made by Aetius (Diels, Doxogr. Gr. p. 306). Velleius in Cicero, de Natura Deorum 1.18.46-7, similarly argues: Nam a natura habemus omnes omnium gentium speciem nullam aliam nisi humanam deorum. quae enim forma alia occurrit umquam aut vigilanti cuiquam aut dormienti? sed, ne omnia revocentur ad primas notiones, ratio hoc idem ipsa declarat. Nam quum praestantissi- mam naturam, vel quia beata est vel quia sempiterna, convenire videatur eamdem esse pulcherrimam, quae compositio membrorum, quae conformatio lineamentorum, quae figura, quae species humana potest esse pulchrior? Velleius continues with the rather cryptic statement that though the gods have a human shape, nevertheless their species is not body but quasi corpus, and it has not got blood, but quasi sangui- nem (49). Apparently Epicurus thought of the gods as having a form (quasi corpus) possessing permanence derived from the continual stream of atoms arriving externally, so that the form remains constant while the matter is continually changing. The gods are located in the intermundia, the spaces between the worlds, where they dwell in peace: Apparet divum numen sedesque quietae quas neque concutiunt venti nec nubila nimbis aspergunt neque nix acri concreta pruina cana cadens violat semperque innubilus aether integit, et large diffuso lumine ridet. (Lucretius 3.18-22). Here they are safe from the destruction to which they would occasionally be liable if they were more closely involved in the world (Seneca, de Benef. 4.4.-19; Cicero, de Divin. 2.17.40).15 1 In c.Cels.4.14 Origen has one sentence about the Epicurean gods which was overlooked by Usener and has not, as far as I know, been considered by students of Epicurus: ol r70o 'EwLKoI'pov Oeo , VOETOL dr6p WV TUyXaVOVTES Ka 7Tbo 6oov rrt 7TV ovo"rdoie civaXvrol, rpay/ari6ovrae rat Ts oporooos 6ovdrroU dwooeieolOat.

Unfortunately utterances of Epicurus himself on this subject have not been preserved to us. But the papyrus rolls discovered in the excava- tions at Herculaneum in 1752 contain fragments of the work On the Gods by Philodemus, the Epicurean of the first century B.C. The fragments of this work were edited by Walter Scott in his Fragmenta Herculanensia (Oxford, 1885), pp. 93-251, and again by Hermann Diels in Abhandlungen der koinigl. preuss. Akademie der Wissenschaften phil. hist. K1. 1915 Heft 7, and 1916 Heft 4 and 6. And here we find a rather startling develop- ment. According to Philodemus it might perhaps be a debatable point whether the gods use furniture or not (Scott, p. 167, and note p. 198; Diels, 1916, Heft 4, p. 33), but they certainly need ,rpof. To them sleep is not necessary for the digestion of food, and in any case bears too great a resemblance to death, but appar- ently they do have o-rvyXav dvaXoyoco-av (Scott, p. 173, and note p. 199; Diels, p. 36).

It appears that there is even sexual differentiation.16 Naturally enough, this Epicurean doctrine was an obvious target for criticism. Sextus Empiricus (adv. Math. 9.178-9) objects that if God has the power of speech, he must also have lungs and windpipe, tongue and mouth - "but this is absurd and approaches the fantastic notions of Epicurus."

The criticism made by Cotta that if the gods have bodies it is difficult to see to what use they put the various parts, is precisely that which Origen makes of the ecclesiastical doctrine of the resurrection of the body. The astonishing thing is that apparently this has not been pointed out earlier. IV The ultimate source of this argument is surely to be found in Plato, Timaeus 33, where the demiurge makes the world o-rat- poEL4SE, not only because the sphere is the most perfect of all shapes, but also because it has no need of eyes or ears, lungs or mouth, hands or feet. If it did possess these, no use could be found for them. It is evident that all the presuppositions of the Epi- curean-Academic debate on the anthropomorphic nature of the " Cf. ibid. 1.29.80: "Ecquos, si non tam strabones, at paetulos esse arbitramur? ecquos naevum habere? ecquos silos, flaccos, frontones, capitones, quae sunt in nobis?" There is perhaps an affinity between this difficulty and Origen's enquiry whether men will have "hirsutum supercilium" and if "mulieribus laeves genae et angusta pectora, ad concipiendos et pariendos fetus venter et femora dilatanda sunt." (ap. Jerome, 378B). Cf. also Cicero, 1.35-99: "Tuus autem deus non digito uno redundat, sed capite, collo, cervicibus, lateribus, alvo, tergo, poplitibus, mani- bus, pedibus, feminibus, cruribus. si, ut immortalis sit, quid haec ad vitam membra pertinent? quid ipsa facies ?"</page><page sequence="13">ORIGEN, CELSUS, AND RESURRECTION 95 gods are to be found expressed in this passage. And thus Origen's criticism of the church doctrine had an interesting history long before his time in the whole tradition of philosophical discussion since Plato. But the further question must now be raised, whether the Timaeus not only influenced Origen's criticism, but also helped to mould his positive conception of the resurrection body? According to the letter of Justinian to the patriarch Menas, Origen affirmed that "in the resurrection the bodies of men rise spherical" (o-baLpoEL&amp;8).s8 The same charge was repeated in the tenth anathema of the council at Constantinople in 543, and on the basis of this Koetschau marked a lacuna in de Principiis 2.1o.3 supposing that Rufinus here followed his usual practice of omitting speculations likely to cause offense to the illiberal orthodoxy of his own day, and that originally Origen suggested explicitly the sphericity of resurrection bodies. If Koetschau is right, then the ultimate influence of the Timaeus is clear,19 though the direct influence may not have been Platonic so much as Stoic.20 But it is difficult to know how far the opinions attrib- uted to Origen by Justinian really go back to Origen himself rather than merely to the monks of the New Laura in the sixth century who were the immediate cause of Justinian's action. No doubt the Origeniasts held views which were a definite advance on the modest speculations of their master; at least, one of the anathemas of the council at Constantinople in 543 is now known to be a quotation from Evagrius Ponticus and not from Origen at all,2 so that it is clear that Justinian was not too careful to verify his references. In short, what we have in the anathemas is an ecclesiastical action arising directly out of the contemporary 18 Mansi IX. 516 D, quoted by Paul Koetschau in his edition of de Principiis (1913) p. 176. 19This has been pointed out by Dr. W.

The nearest approach that Origen makes to this doctrine is in the well-known passage, de Oratione 31.3, and it has been thought that it was superficial reading of this passage which led to this doctrine being attributed to Origen.22 The whole passage is so relevant to the present discussion that I venture to attempt a translation. In the context he is discussing such problems as the right time and place and the most suitable posture for prayer. So he says: And as kneeling is necessary when anyone is about to accuse himself to God of his own sins, and is supplicating that they may be healed and forgiven, we ought to realize that it is an outward sign of the humble and submissive man; as Paul says, "For this cause I bow my knees to the Father from whom every family in heaven and earth is named." But spiritual kneeling, which is so called because everything in existence has submitted to God "in the name of Jesus" and has humbled itself to Him, seems to me to be indicated by the apostle when he says "that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth." (Phil. 2.1o). But it is not in the least necessary to suppose that the bodies of the heavenly beings are so shaped as to have physical knees, since those who have discussed them in a scholarly way have proved that their bodies are spherical. Anyone unwilling to accept this will have to accept the notion that each limb has its uses, since otherwise God would have created parts for them which have no function, - unless he is prepared shamelessly to defy the canons of reason. In either case he will fall into difficulties, whether he says that God has provided them with useless bodily limbs which have no proper function, or if he affirms that even in the case of the heavenly beings the digestive organs and the large intestine perform their characteristic functions. It would be exceedingly stupid if anyone were to think that, like statues, it is only their outward appearance which has a human form and not their inner reality.23 I say this as studying the meaning of 22 Cf.

And the same argument applies to the saying written in the prophet: Every knee shall bow to me" (Isa. 45-23). It is clear that here Origen is making no specific reference to the resurrection at all. When he speaks of rw^v &amp;rovpavhov r&amp; trwpama, he is primarily thinking of the "spheres" in the sense of the stars and the heavenly bodies generally. But Origen uses pre- cisely the same arguments to prove that the spheres cannot bow the knee as he uses to prove that the resurrection does not mean that the physical and earthly body will be reconstituted. Koetschau thinks that in his translation of de Princ. 2.10.3 Rufinus omitted the reference to the supposed sphericity of the resurrection body, and therefore marks a lacuna. But it is open to at least two serious objections. In the first place, there is no place in the Latin text where the sentence from Justinian can naturally be fitted. And, in fact, Koetschau simply marks the lacuna at the end of the paragraph; but there is little connec- tion which might lead us to expect some such reference. And in the second place, there is the even greater difficulty that if in the de Principiis Origen had committed himself to any such suggestion, it becomes very difficult to see why this was not men- tioned in the Origenistic controversy at the end of the fourth century. In fact, the greatest difficulty in the way of supposing Origen to have asserted the sphericity of the resurrection body is that neither Jerome nor Methodius says so. Both of them would have had every reason to mention this point, since it was their immediate object to draw attention to the offensive aspects of his doctrine. Yet neither of them expressly attributes this opinion to Origen. Methodius (de Resurrectione 3.15.1) asks Aglaophon what shape he supposes that the resurrection body will be. "Will it be in the shape of a circle, or a polygon, or a cube, or a pyra- between drupcri'eta and r- av pC dOet compare, e.g., Clement Paed. 3.4.1. The simile rpo6rov da5pptaOrow quite clearly betrays again the influence of the Academic criti- cism of Epicurus. Cf. the Academic Cotta in Cicero, de Nat. Deor. 1.26.71: "Non est corpus, sed quasi corpus. hoc intelligerem quale esset, si id in ceris fingeretur aut fictilibus figuris." Ibid. 1.27.75: "Dicemus igitur idem quod in Venere Coa, corpus illud non est, sed simile corporis, nec ille fusus et candore mixtus rubor sanguis est, sed quaedam sanguinis similitudo; sic in Epicureo deo non res, sed similitudines rerum esse."</page><page sequence="16">98 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW mid?" (apa KVKXoTEpEg TO q 7OXvyW;LOV t V KVOLKOV T qrvpa/LOEL8aoE ) . )24 The sarcasm implies that this would be the logical corollary of the Origenist view, but suggests at the same time that he did not find this opinion expressed by Origen himself. Nevertheless, it was perhaps this sentence of Methodius which may have been the cause of the supposition that Origen held this view. In his letter to Eustochium consoling her upon the death of her mother, Paula (Ep. io8), Jerome relates how Paula once met with a follower of Origen 25 who raised doubts in her mind about the resurrection of the flesh, asking whether there would be sexual differentiation in the next world, and maintaining that risen bodies would be tenuia et spiritualia. Jerome says that he went to the man and cross-questioned him; finding his answers unsatisfactory, he replied for him and drew his inferences from the other's premises; the risen Christ had shown his hands and feet - "ossa audis et carnem, pedes et manus; et globos mihi Stoicorum atque aeria quaedam deliramenta confingis" (Ep. 108.24, P. 343, ed. Hilberg). Again, it is difficult to know how far this is to be taken seriously; it reads as if Jerome is assuming that because the Origenists deny physical resurrection they must therefore follow the Stoics in supposing that disembodied souls are spherical. What Origen really did say is preserved by Methodius and Jerome. So the body has well been called a river, since strictly speaking its primary substance does not perhaps remain the same even for two days; yet Paul or Peter are always the same, not merely with respect to the soul. . . . , because the form (Edos) which characterises the body remains the same, so that the marks which are characteristic of the physical quality of Peter and Paul remain constant; it is because of the preserving of this quality that scars caused in our youth persist in our bodies, and so with certain other peculiarities, moles and similar marks. 24 Velleius in Cic. de Nat. Deor. 1.10.24 criticizes the Platonic opinion that the world is spherical (rotundum) because this is the most beautiful shape, saying: "At mihi vel cylindri vel quadrati vel coni vel pyramidis videtur esse formosior." 25Perhaps John of Jerusalem is the person in mind. Baronius suggested Pal- ladius who lived at Bethlehem for a year with Posidonius the Theban, according to Hist. Laus. 36 (p. 107.1 ed. Butler). Cf. Vallarsi's note, I (Verona, 1734) p. 709 note b.</page><page sequence="17">ORIGEN, CELSUS, AND RESURRECTION 99 It is this same physical form (that which characterizes Peter and Paul) which the soul will again possess in the resurrection, though the form will then be much improved; but it will not be exactly as it was on earth. For just as a man has roughly the same appearance from infancy to old age, even if his features seem to undergo much change, so also there will be the same sort of relation between the earthly form and that to come. It will be the same although it will also be vastly improved. The reason for this is that wherever the soul is it has to have a body suitable for the place where it finds itself; if we were going to live in the sea we should need fins and scales like fishes; if we are to live in heaven, then we shall need spiritual bodies. The earthly form is not lost, just as the form of Jesus did not become quite different on the mount of the Transfiguration. (Origen ap. Method. I.22.3-5). In Jerome (adv. Joh. Hier. 26, 376C) we learn that one reason for the preservation of the earthly form is that it is only fair and just for the soul which has sinned in one body that it should be punished in that and not in another body: "Alia ratione resurrectionem corporum confitemur, eorum quae in sepulcris posita sunt, dilapsaque in cineres: Pauli Pauli, et Petri Petri, et singula singulorum, neque enim fas est ut in aliis corporibus animae peccaverint, in aliis torqueantur; nec justi judicis, alia corpora pro Christo sanguinem fundere, et alia coronari." Those who held the popular doctrine could appeal to such scriptural passages as the story of the witch of Endor, or the parable of Dives and Lazarus, in which souls after death were described as still possessing human form. But Origen contends (ap. Method. 3.I7) that the parable, rightly understood, affords no support to a theory which maintains physical resurrection, for the reason that the parable is describing the soul of Dives while in the waiting state, so to speak, and has no reference to the resurrection. In this state the soul apparently preserves the same shape as the gross and earthly body: Kai 7~Xa 7~ 7r CIVX~~ d~4La i-fl &amp;~4aXXayjj ,XELa, 1 oLOLE 0 ov T y TCaXEL Kat y-qtvco oraC', 8varsaL OVr0 XaopaVET-OaL. At any rate, according to all accounts ghostly apparitions have the form formerly possessed by the dead person. But this is before the end of the world and</page><page sequence="18">100 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW the parousia, and is therefore before the resurrection. In this intermediate state the soul may appear in its ghostly form; so Plato (Phaedo 8ID) spoke of the "shadowy apparitions" seen round tombs; and in the contra Celsum (2.6o) we learn that the cause of these apparitions is that the soul is subsisting in what is called the luminous body: 7r a~' 'v YLuV"Eva ITEptL vX 26 TEOV7)KoTov cfavrlTaO7Laa aLTro TLvol vITOKELLLEIVOV ytlETaL, WV KCaT nVq bEui7)l V aV E(V TE K LXOVYLil CLV7OEL3EL CrarL. 7 As against his opponents Origen also denied that any argu- ment for the physical resurrection of the flesh could be based on the narratives in the Gospels about the resurrection of Jesus. For the body of Jesus was sui generis, as is immediately apparent from consideration of his virgin birth. Admittedly he ate and drank after the resurrection and showed the disciples his hands, his feet, and his side; yet he can pass through locked doors, and while breaking bread can vanish out of their sight.28 And even before the resurrection certain things said about Jesus in the Gospels do not in any way correspond with our normal physical experience, as for example in the Transfiguration. It is clear to any careful reader of the Gospels that Jesus appeared differ- ently to different people, and had many aspects (rtrvoLaL), so that his appearance varied according to the spiritual capacity of the beholder." Since, therefore, his body manifested such peculiarities, it is hardly possible to use his body as a ground for the argument that our resurrection bodies will be the same as on earth. Such a doctrine of the humanity of Christ was per- haps well on the way towards docetism, but this never seems to have troubled Origen who, in this respect as in others, faithfully represents the Alexandrian Christological tradition."

Cels. 3.4I; 4.57; and 6.77. V In conclusion, one fundamental principle may be put forward for consideration. In any attempt to reconstruct Origen's theol- ogy of the resurrection full weight must be given to our primary authorities, Methodius and Jerome. Unless some further Origen find in Egypt " restores to us Origen's original discussion of the matter, we can perhaps never know exactly how he formulated his thought. But it must remain more than doubtful whether he ever in fact committed himself to the suggestion that in the resurrection we shall be spheres. On the contrary, the evidence points to the conclusion that he held to the continuance of per- sonal identity in some form. And we have seen that the well- known passage in de Oratione 31.3 is primarily concerned with the denial that the heavenly bodies can bow the knee and that the Pauline text (Phil. 2.10o) is to be interpreted literally. There is no specific reference in this passage to the resurrection. The two sentences in Methodius and Jerome which we have discussed above (p. 22) suggest, on the other hand, that the notion was an inference drawn either by his followers or by his opponents from his adoption of the Academic criticism of the Epicurean gods. However that may be, the critical examination of the evi- dence should warn us to be on our guard against blindly following Justinian, as is done by Koetschau and de Faye." No doubt it is true that Justinian can be justified in so far as Neoplatonism had penetrated the monasteries under the cover of Origen's name. But if we are dealing with Justinian as an authority for the actual doctrine of Origen himself, difficulties immediately arise. I venture to think that the only question is how far he can safely be distrusted. 34There is as yet no information whether fragments of Origen's lost work on the resurrection have been found in the Toura-find; cf. M. O. Gueraud's article in Revue de l'Histoire des Religions, Jan. 1946. ' Cf. Koetschau's edition of the de Principiis (Leipzig, 1913) p. 176; de Faye, op. cit.
