As these objects represent the sacred or hold magic power, they cannot be just discarded as rubbish. They have to be treated in particular ways in accordance with the religious beliefs of their owners. Three main types of action applied to such objects after being extracted from their original context can be discerned in archaeological and historical sources. They can be either buried in special favissae, destroyed, or taken away to exile (Ben Tor 2006). Taking sacred objects into exile is usually attested to in texts, but burial and destruction or mutilation is easily observed in archaeological evidence. Ritual burial caches are a well known phenomenon in the Near East (Garfinkel 1994). Ritual objects also can be deliberately destroyed for "political" or "ritual" reasons (Ben Tor 2006: 12-13; Garfinkel 2009). It is difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish between "political" and "religious" destruction or mutilation without textual evidence. In other words, these objects can be destroyed as a political statement, or these acts were performed in order to achieve metaphysical changes of some kind (Garfinkel 2009:101). Thus, the question of motivation for the deliberate destruction of sacred objects in prehistoric periods is more complicated. A case of deliberately destroyed sacred objects and possible motives in the context of Chalcolithic settlement will be discussed in this paper. The Chalcolithic culture of the Golan Heights was discovered in the early 1970's and has been reasonably well documented thanks to extensive survey and excavation (Kochavi et al. 1972; Epstein 1998). Ten Chalcolithic sites, excavated by Epstein, provide a detailed picture of the material culture of this agrarian society. A further extensive survey was recently carried out on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority by M. Hartal and I. Ben-Efraim, considerably 83</page><page sequence="2">84 MICHAEL FREIKMAN enriching our knowledge of the Chalcolithic settlement pattern in this area with the discovery of hundreds of sites. Nevertheless, cultic aspects of the culture of the inhabitants are almost unknown to us. The only objects published to date which can be interpreted as cultic are the basalt pillar figures, or so-called "Household Idols/' described by Epstein (Epstein 1975; 1980; 1988; 1998: 230-233). These objects are the subject of the following discussion. DATA REVIEW As of today, more than 50 basalt pillar figures have been found in the Golan Heights (Epstein 1998: 230-233), and Tel Teo (Epstein 1988: 208) and Tell Turmus (Epstein 1988: 208) in the Huleh Valley. Basically, these objects share similar features; they are shaped as basalt cylinders with a shallow depression on top. Usually they display human features, but the level of definition can vary significantly from very detailed human faces, including eyes, ears, mouths (Figla,;Epstein 1998: Pl.XXXIII: 1, 5, 11) and even beards (Figlb; Epstein 1998: Pl.XXXII: 2-3) to totally blank objects (Epstein 1998: PLXXXII: 5). In some cases the representations bear horns (Figlc; Epstein 1998: Pl. XXX). These objects were mostly found in the context of the Chalcolithic houses. A few were found during surveys or picked up by amateurs. However, it is probable that their original contexts were the same. The cultic significance of these objects is not doubted, although the meaning and exact function of these objects is not clear. Epstein interpreted the horned and bearded statues as "flock gods" and hornless statues as "crop gods" (Epstein 1980: 20; 1998: 230-231). Beck disagreed and interpreted them as "pedestals or altars for offerings" (Beck 2002: 226). The rejection of the idea that pillar sculptures are representations of anthropomorphic gods is strengthened by a recently published object found in Northern Jordan. The basalt figure of a bull with a shallow bowl on top of its back and characteristic nose (Fig. 2) was made in the same fashion as the pillar figures (Von Moawiyah and Mittmann 1998).

Eight out of the 50 objects found by Epstein in situ during her excavations were described as broken. In fact, close inspection of these objects has shown that at least 14 (29.4%) bear evidence of considerable damage, as will be described below. One further broken pillar figure was found by the author of this paper during recent excavations at the site of El 'Arbain (Fig. 3a, b). Breaking of these objects is usually ascribed to their falling down from the low benches or shelves where they previously stood (Epstein 1980: 21). However, scrupulous reexamination of the assemblage of these stands shows that the picture is not as clear as it was presented until now. There is no evidence that the Chalcolithic sites of the Golan were ever reused after their abandonment and the small amount of debris above the walls makes the existence of another storey unlikely. According to Epstein, the pillar figures stood on low shelves against the walls. But even if they stood on the upper level of the buildings or on top of their roofs, they could not have stood higher than 2 to 2.5 m above the ground. In most cases the height was obviously much lower. Basalt is a very strong material. It is, in general, unlikely that basalt objects would break into pieces as a result of impact with the basalt floor or other basalt objects after falling from such a height. Even if some of them might have broken as a result of some kind of natural defect, the number of such objects would not amount to as much as a third of the known total of objects, as we have in this case. As already stated, to date at least 51 objects (including the one found during the recent excavation at El ' Arbain) of this type have been collected and catalogued, of which at least 15</page><page sequence="4">36 MICHAEL FREIKMAN A M -f iili m WSM ' I - • «*: ' J ; ,• »■ / ■HBiUflHHHHi " V Mjmil Fig. 3: Basalt figure found in El 'Arbain</page><page sequence="5">PILLAR FIGURES OF THE GOLAN CHALCOLITHIC 8 7 were considerably damaged.

Only in 11 cases were the removed flakes found and collected. In most cases the removal of the upper part or flakes removed from the top of the figure were not found. Moreover, not only small flakes, but also large fragments of the shattered objects, which could be easily recognized by the excavators were not found. Most of the pillar figures were found inside houses which had never been reused. Thus, the possibility that the removal of any of the fragments had been carried out by natural forces or later inhabitants is unlikely. Most probably, the last Chalcolithic people that saw these objects broken (for whatever reason) took the missing parts with them. It is also very probable that these were the same people who broke them. In order to test assumptions regarding pillar figure's breaking patterns, the author carried out an experiment intended to test the possibility that the breakage marks were intentional, and as consequence to assess the likelihood of natural causes of damage to the pillar figures, such as falling down or being smashed by other basalt objects. Eight basalt rocks similar in shape and size to the basalt figures were chosen. One larger flat stone was used as an anvil. Each of the other seven stones was dropped twice in succession from a height of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 meters respectively. As stated above, a height of four meters is almost twice as high as any possible spot from which the original Chalcolithic pillar objects could have fallen. Falling from a height of less than four meters had no visible effect on the rocks. Falling from a height of four metres caused only minimal damage to the rocks, removing tiny pieces of the oxidized cortex (Fig. 10), but no breakage or cracks could be observed. Furthermore, the stones were hit with the sharp edge of a 5 kg. steel hammer, but only after 7-8 hits on average would they break. The breakage lines were not straight, similar to broken stones found occasionally in the field. Another way to destroy these objects was to hit them with a smaller hammer, applying a chisel to the surface of the object. This striking technique allowed the concentration of much more energy onto a specific point and to much greater effect. The easiest way to break off parts of a basalt object is to apply the tool close to the edge of the object at an angle of 70-75 degrees. In this fashion, small flakes can be removed from the object (Fig. 11). Objects broken in this way during the experiment show a particular breakage pattern: the surface bears a shallow depression following the spread of the force (Fig. 12). Very similar marks were found on the original objects (Figs. 3b, 4b). On the other hand, they never appear on occasionally broken basalt rocks. Thus, at least two different kinds of damage can be achieved: direct percussion, hitting a stone with another heavy object (i.e., a hammer or a stone axe) at a particular spot, or indirect percussion using some sort of chisel and hitting the weakest points of a vessel. In both cases relatively great physical force has to be applied to a specific point in order to achieve breakage. In this context it is worth mentioning an unworked elongated basalt cobble found about a meter from the object excavated in El 'Arbain (Fig. 13a) showing very clear damage marks on its tip (Fig. 13b).</page><page sequence="9">PILLAR FIGURES OF THE GOLAN CHALCOLITHIC 9 \ Fig. 10: Damage pattern as a result of free falling (experiment) Fig. 11: Damage pattern as a result of a chisel strike (experiment)</page><page sequence="10">92 MICHAEL FREIKMAN Fig. 12: Negative of a chisel strike (experiment) Jggj I ' x- '** " m Fig. 13: A tool which was possibly used for destroying the figures at El 'Arbain Such damage marks could be caused only by direct blows on another stone object, such as the mentioned pillar figure. This object weights more than six kg. and easily could have been used for breaking the figure. Thus, though it is theoretically possible that an occasional object might break due to natural causes, this was not confirmed by the experimental cases. Generally, the damage patterns found on the pillar figures recall those achieved in the course of the experimental breakage.</page><page sequence="11">PILLAR FIGURES OF THE GOLAN CHALCOLITHIC 93 DISCUSSION It becomes clear that the percentage of intentionally broken pillar figures is much greater than was presented in Epstein's final report. Almost one third were significantly damaged in ways which do not conform the natural breakage patterns. The vast majority of these broken or damaged objects share similar characteristics: they were usually broken in their upper part; the broken part is in most cases missing from the place where the object was found. A special effort was made to destroy the fringes of the cup. One may conclude that just before deserting their houses the residents deliberately put their cultic objects out of use. They probably tried to break them, but on account of the exceptional durability of the material and the possible lack of time, were not able to do so. For that reason, in most cases they were satisfied with destroying the upper part of the basalt pillars, removing flakes from the fringes of the cup. The cup probably served for libations or burning incense of some kind (Beck 2002) and it is logical to assume that it was functionally the most important part of the object. Thus, the objects were put out of use by eliminating the option of using their upper cup. Taking into account that basalt is an imperishable and weighty material, the lack of fragments, which were broken off in most cases, is significant. One may assume that the missing parts were collected after destruction and placed in a separate location. As basalt fragments are heavy, they were probably deposited near the abandoned site. As mentioned above, deliberate destruction and deposition of objects for different reasons is not unknown in the prehistoric Near East and can be traced to as early as the Neolithic Period. An interesting parallel is a bow buried together with a man in the so called "Cave of the Warrior" (Schick et al. 1998: 128-129). This bow was quite clearly deliberately broken during the burial procedure (Schick et al. 1998: 129). Earlier, the same phenomenon was observed in Predynastic Egypt (Hayes 1953: 280). As many of the Golan pillar figures were horned, of special interest is the burial of an anthropomorphic bronze horned god figure found in Enkomi in a much later period (Dikaios 1969: 198-9; PI. 43). A large deposit of figures and other objects were discovered inside a pit dug into a floor in Kissonerga-Mophilia (Peltenburg et al. 1989). Most of the figures were found broken, which was explained as an intentional ritual action (Goring 1991: 52). The phenomenon of sacral burial in prehistoric and later periods has been described in detail and discussed elsewhere (Garfinkel 1994,2008; Ben-Tor 2006). Similar occurences of magical destruction were observed in various Neolithic sites. However, here they were ritually "killed" as part of preparation for hunt. A cache of animal figures, some of them ritually "slaughtered," was found in a pit inside a PPNB house in 'Ain Ghazal (McAdam 1997:131 -135). This same phenomenon has been found in Sha'ar Hagolan and Munhata (Freikman &amp; Garfinkel 2009). The practice of detaching animal figure's heads is reported in Tell Sabi Abyad (Verhoeven 2007). The exact purpose of the basalt pillars remains unclear to us. In fact, we do not even know how these figures, usually explained by archaeologists as "gods" or as "fertility symbols"</page><page sequence="12">94 MICHAEL FREIKMAN (Epstein 1998:230-231; Verhoeven 2007), were used and understood by the Chalcolithic people. However, with this new information it is very probable that they were intentionally destroyed during the final stage of their usage. The phenomenon of intentional destruction and burial of sacred objects would not be exceptional for the Golan Chalcolithic culture and it fits well into the cultural and ritual context of late prehistoric periods in the Southern Levant.
