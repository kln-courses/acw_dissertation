"Elephants may not have a graveyard but they seem to have some concept of Members of a bond group meet and perform a greeting ceremony. From Elephant Memories: Thirteen Years in the Life of an Elephant Family. 190 American Scientist, Volume 77 death. It is probably the single strangest thing about them. Unlike other animals, elephants recognize one of their own car casses or skeletons," writes Cynthia Moss. The topic of life and death in ele phant society has fascinated many wild life biologists and Moss is no exception. She has the ability and knowledge to interweave elephant observations in the wild with stories about camp life, convey ing scientific information in an entertain ing style, sometimes metaphorical and heartening. Once one identifies with the character it becomes easier to flow with the author's stream of thoughts, even though many are anthropomorphic. It is apparent that we are dealing not with ordinary but with extraordinary field ob servations ranging over a period of 13 years. These observations are augmented by photographs and notes of other natu ralists whose combined experience covers a total of about a quarter of a century. Cynthia Moss is an unique elephanto logist; she "sticks her trunk out" and expresses herself more freely than pre ceding and contemporaneous workers. The main reason for this outright descrip tion is her confidence from long-term exposure to the elephants. Her summa ries of the elephants' families, which in clude "family trees," comprehensive photographic identification files, a unique naming system, and meticulous notes on elephant observations and their idiosyn cracies, are novel approaches when taken in toto. Minor flaws include a few typo graphical errors, confusion between the words "teat" and "nipple" (elephants have nipples, not teats), calling the wrist a "knee," abundant usage of the word "never," and at times writing "theory" instead of "hypothesis." These flaws do not detract from the superb presentation and profound impact of the book.?Jehes kel Shoshani, Biological Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit</page></plain_text>
