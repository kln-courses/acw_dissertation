<plain_text><page sequence="1">CREATIVE URBANISM1 by CHRISTOPHER TUNNARD Director of the Graduate Program in City Planning Yale University the great state of Texas there lives a man whose income is reputed to be a million dollars a week. He lives in a sprawling city which has grown without a plan, which lacks even the most rudimentary control over the use of land. The man and the city are symbols of an illusion that progress is measured in terms of money and aggrandizement. Material progress is certainly to be desired - it is one of the necessities of a better life - but it is not to be held up as an ideal in itself. For of what use is it to know that you live in the richest city in the world when underneath it all there is perhaps the unsatisfied feeling that the true riches are learning and beauty and vision and art? Today a hot wind is blowing over Texas ; but should Athena once turn her gaze across the broad United States her wrath would chill us to the heart. For the sake of impersonality, take any modern city from Miami to San Diego and what has art to say in the premises? Before art's austere regard, Ralph Adams Cram once told us, the bold pleading of business efficiency, of a mechanistic philosophy of evolution falls thin and unconvincing. Dead cities rise up before us, cities now marred and degraded, yet beautiful still in their decaying state: Venice and Palermo, Bruges and Hildesheim, and with them we are called on to match Birmingham and Chicago and Pittsburgh and St. Louis, or any other city dominated by industrial civilization. Is the contrast worth the price? We were meant to live surrounded by evidences of art, to cherish it and to create it, and a civilization which functions in ugliness is a civilization of the wrong shape, regardless of the evidence of the bank, the clearing house or the balance of trade. If the city mirrors civilization, if we focus civilization through the city then certainly the lack of art in our environment is one of the most serious social problems of today. An Intensified Problem Although city planning is a comparatively new technique, its professionals have been faced with a larger number of responsibilities than may be considered proportionate to the development of their professional skills. Economics, demography, social communications and other fields have had to be mastered in haste to keep up with the variable nature of modern civic problems. We are now under a new obligation which is based on a change in the world situation. It is, of course, inevitable that changes in the political and economic sphere should reflect in one way or another on the city since the city is the market 1 Enlarged from a lecture called Urbanism, Art and Life given in the Auditorium of the Anderson Memorial Library at the University of Houston, Texas on March 8, 1951.</page><page sequence="2">i9£i CHRISTOPHER TUNNARD 217 place and increasingly the center of all of our more complex human activities. The new responsibility involves the appearance of a mid-century attitude toward the city which is different from the attitude, say, of the 1890^ or even of the i92o's when the Horatio Alger-Chamber of Commerce optimism of civic growth and expansion was still current. It is now quite obvious to most people that the city, instead of being an ever-expanding organism which somehow would be grand because it was great, is in reality a body subject to alarmingly morbid conditions. The attention of the civic surgeon has become necessary in order to remove and replace large sections of this body which are proving to be sources of infection - sources which cannot be allowed to fester in the system or obstruct its proper functioning. It has been discovered, rather late in the day, that the economic function is quite intimately related to urban physical planning. The world situation has brought about a new attitude, especially in the United States. Since the end of World War II this country has been forced into a position of enormous political, economic and cultural responsibility. It is a responsibility which seems likely to grow with the years. This is not the occasion to analyze all the trends which are emerging from this situation but it is evident that one of them is a growing consciousness of the unfortunate heritage which years of neglect have produced in our environment, both rural and urban, and the determination to do something about it. Not only in the United States is this attitude apparent, but also in France, Britain and many other countries where of recent years more and more attention has been paid to redevelopment of older parts of the community. It is also apparent that in large areas of the world like the Indian sub-continent, Africa and South America the extraction of raw materials, usually followed by industrialization, is focusing attention on the urban centers that are growing up as a result. Forces are at work in these new centers of industry and trade which are inevitably producing an -intense interest in the urban environment. * It is significant that the countries which have gone furthest along the road to economic justice and political equality, those in which individual rights are most adequately safeguarded and opportunities for individual development are most widespread, are precisely those in which urbanization has gone furthest.'1 This new aspect of the human interest in cities is reflected in numberless ways. In Britain it has been the result of the war itself; in the United States it has been a matter of an awakening of conscience ; in South America it has been a sudden jump in the rate of development which has wiped out the usefulness of earlier means of transportation and of production. It is possible to say now that all thinking on city planning has become sharpened, and that it is sharpness and scale which is the key to many city planning activities now going on. Naturally former methods of planning will continue to be employed but one type of planning with which we have been familiar now for many years - the two- dimensional diagram of land allocation with perhaps some social emphasis on 1 J. B. Condliffe, Planning Pamphlets No. 18, National Planning Association, Washington, January 1943.</page><page sequence="3">218 CREATIVE URBANISM October housing and mechanical emphasis on traffic facilities is not going to satisfy many interests in the city from now on. There are people in all countries who are beginning to look at the city more closely and to demand a community which is satisfying in more dimensions than two. It is true that some famous plans of the past appear to be two-dimensional in emphasis; one of these is the Plan des Artistes done at the time of the French Revolution; this was a plan conceived in all dimensions and assured of a three-dimensional technique because of the age in which it was born. There is no guaranteeing nowadays that a two- dimensional plan will be satisfactory when built up; in fact three-dimensional quality has been lacking for the past two decades. Street planning without reference to architecture has been the order of the day. The public has been indifferent to visual anarchy but it is learning fast. A witness to the change in emphasis can be cited in the recent plans for the City of London and in Title One of the United States Housing Act of 1 949 in which redevelopment plans are to be carefully examined for detailed design aspects before being given Federal approval. There are also signs of a rebirth of public criticism such as assailed the astonished Haussmann when he began to tamper with the parvis of Notre Dame. It would be unwise to assume that a re-examination of the city, and as a result improvement in the quality of city planning, will be immediately effective particularly in the underdeveloped parts of the world. For many years there will be deficiencies and lacunae in programs of development both of natural resources and of city building. The Twentieth Century Fund estimates that even in highly developed countries the largest difference between estimated needs and demands will be in urban redevelopment, highways and conservation works. 1 Even so, with an increase in the number of parties committed to the theory of abundance and sharing which is now bound up with our older traditions of material progress, we may expect to see more attention being given to the city as a fountainhead of culture and wealth, all critics of the city and of its value to society notwithstanding. It is a curious fact that as we examine older societies - as a civilization recedes further into history or at least far enough so that we feel safe in making an estimate of its contribution - our attention focuses on the urban agglomerations which that civilization has produced. At such a distance the anthropologist finds himself prone to examine cultural manifestations in the forms of art. We may assume that in our own case history will judge us largely on the communities we build just as we judge people who built in other times. Although it would be misleading to put an undue emphasis on art in city building certainly the esthetic aspect looms large in such estimations. One of the questions that is now being put in places as far separated as Rio de Janeiro and Stockholm is: How is it possible to build to satisfy the eye while we are satis- fying the social demands of our time ? In the United States where the esthetic effect has often come by accident rather than design (the picturesque skyline 1 J. Frederick Dewhurst &amp; Associates, America's Needs and Resources, Twentieth Century Fund, New York, 1947, P- 389-</page><page sequence="4">i9Si CHRISTOPHER TUNNARD 219 of the average larger American city is one of these accidents) the esthetic problem and detailed question of scale and decoration have long been ignored. We have preferred the approach of Jane Addams and Edward Bok, Jacob Reiss, and Theodore Roosevelt who tried to reform our surroundings by other means. We listened only briefly to Daniel Burnham and Edward H. Bennett who preached the commercial value of beauty to the business mind. We have long imagined that it was correct to admire novelty in spite of warnings as to where this attitude would lead us from Americans and foreigners alike. Latterly a wave of neo- Puritanism has made visual elegance unpopular ; whereas at an earlier period in our history a certain native exuberance of spirit acted as a compensation for the miles and miles of urban ugliness. Our surroundings are judged either on utilitarian considerations or occasionally on the * good ' they do to people. If architecture is appreciated esthetically it is as a single work of art unrelated to its surroundings. This is unfortunate because any long range view of environment - an artistic experience as well as a sociological phenomenon - must take in the scale of things and their detailed relationships. If we believe that art is a major civilizing influence and that there should be a better integration of art and life as our philosophers are constantly demanding, then the art of city building must become in our time the mistress art. City planning will more and more assume the quality of an art the nearer we come to regarding the city as a cultural entity and the more we integrate neglected human skills and crafts into its fabric. We shall not, however, achieve approba- tion by those growing numbers of people who are demanding that the city be a positive expression of culture unless we are also willing, to cultivate new approaches. One of these must be the inculcation of a sense of tradition which is missing from so many of the planning schemes of today. The faster we travel, the more we advance in technology, the more comfortable we become and the safer from the accidents of nature, the more we regret being cut off from our ancestors by the airconditioned, stream-lined, mechanical civilization with which business and industry surrounds us. Evidence of this longing for identifica- tion with the past is to be found in recent increases in the rediscovery and restoration of historic shrines and the number of historical studies. This too is a phenomenon which is occurring in different countries. It would be folly on the part of the city planner to continue in the tradition of the 1930's and 40 's when so many planning schemes ignored this demand by sweeping away everything in their path. It does not need much imagination to see that a completely different approach to city planning will be necessary in order to integrate the past with the present while we are planning for the future. We shall have to learn what the past has to offer and where the points of departure may be found, for the past contains dross as well as the pure metal. A cool eye and a warm hearf are necessary for this task; the traditions worth building on are there, but they may be obscured, neglected or forgotten. Sometimes it may be necessary to go against the stream as the Utopians and Louis Sullivan did. The rewards, however, will be there.</page><page sequence="5">22o CREATIVE URBANISM October The Social Basis of Urban Esthetics There is irony in contemporary attitudes which exalt * social ' planning over planning which aims to satisfy the esthetic sense, as if the latter were inevitably frivolous or anti-social. It goes without saying that environmental planning should be based on social needs although it is not a corollary that 1 planning O which ignores social needs must necessarily be bad. Many J examples 1 O O J J I from the past can find justification for modern use although their origin was based on an entirely different set of values from those now obtaining. Nevertheless, a social program which carries conviction is necessary to the success of any undertaking. Two neglected social needs have been mentioned ; they are 1 . The satisfactions to be obtained through urban art. 2 . A sense of continuity with the past. There is a problem, however, in relating the program of planning to the physical result of that program. It is posed in the question: Can social needs be auto- matically objectified in specific urban forms? The difficulty here is that basic social needs are not often composed of images of objects in the mind of the program-maker. * Home ' (typified in house and garden) can perhaps be visualized in a. general way, but there are an infinite number of variants in the execution. When we come to basic needs like * security/ ' influence on others/ ' reputation ' it is impossible to visualize them in physical form. We are thus confronted with a possible danger - a purely social program of urban planning or improvement may eliminate entirely the ' duality of happiness that flows from the senses and the imagination.' We must therefore be careful of relying on the social program alone to supply the human satisfactions that are implicit in the making of such a program at all (this prompts the suggestion of a dualism in planning organization which will be referred to later). We must remember that the satisfactions and pleasures which the social program is meant to secure are in the last analysis strongly esthetic - imbued with the variety of nature and the infinity of art. The need for moral values woven into the program and perpetuated by it becomes less and less as the evils are removed. We do not say * abolish the slum because it is ugly ' (although the effectiveness of this approach has occasionally been spectacular) but * remove it because it is evil.' If, however, the buildings replacing the tenements are ugly in their turn the program is in danger of failing in its social objective regardless of any achieve- ments in comfort and better living standards. The theory that the just social program will automatically result in * good ' solutions is thus destroyed by experience. What connections then can we find between the social basis of planning and the objects that we see around us as its result? We could base our physical design on existing social habits but we would be in danger of perpetuating false traditions if we were not well grounded in the motivations which produce the habit patterns. Furthermore, the habits are constantly changing and are</page><page sequence="6">i9£i CHRISTOPHER TUNNARD 221 influenced tremendously by the theatre in which they take place. The once- leisurely atmosphere of the meeting place along the Via Tornabuoni has been shattered by the noise of the lorries rattling by. The American pastime of watching the view from the front stoop is disappearing with the change in pace of modern traffic and the enticements of new forms of entertainment. It would seemingly be wiser to examine more fundamental social motivations which must be expressed or catered to by the urban planner. This is a field for a research analyst of special training but one or two motivations may be mentioned here to give a clew to the necessary types of investigation. 1. The Drive for Individual Expression. In urban form this drive has found expression in domestic architecture, public monuments and civic benefactions, often of a curious physical character. It is not a motivation which will disappear although its vagaries may be curtailed by economic and social limitations. We have all enjoyed the equivalent of a highly colored folk art in house design not fed by superimposed ideas of taste enforced by social pressure. We have seen the subjugation of this exuberance in the monotony of modern suburban developments or in earlier civic domestic architecture such as the brownstone row. We must decide whether or not freedom of expression uninhibited by standards of taste should be fostered by urban planning. If we decide that it has a place in modern society then our planning may be very different from any currently being practised because the question of freedom of expression in individual buildings will be uppermost in the planner's mind and he will leave room for it in his designs. We may also find that certain crafts and forms of decoration should be revived with positive direction in order to enrich the possibilities of individual expression in urban surroundings. 2. The Drive for Identification of The Individual with The Group. If this drive is strong (and we are told by social psychologists that this is so) the need for individual expression may be somewhat subordinated to the desire for social identification. The street and the neighbourhood are involved here and conformity certainly plays its part. In the present state of building economics this drive may perhaps be satisfied in other ways than by urban planning - through social activities and group organization. In physical form we are likely to see in this mechanized age the larger unit of planning with houses and other types of buildings being produced in large quantities, perhaps indeed satisfying the need for group identification in a visual sense. Possibly both (1) and (2) can be satisfied in a superficial way by encouraging conformity in developments and also artistic expression and variety on the part of artisans and individuals. 3. The Drive for Identification of Group with Group. In a larger sense this is the drive of our political natures - getting people together in groups, in regions, in nations and finally in an international way. It is the essence of the word community in its widest definition. If this drive for co-operation were not there one could feel hopeless about civic design; but it is there, latent, and must be understood by the urban planner in order to achieve his program. It is perhaps</page><page sequence="7">222 CREATIVE URBANISM October the weakest of the three motivations, one which requires constant stimulation and encouragement to be important in the urban scene. It could be productive of extraordinarily effective physical plans and our aim must be to discover a type of planning which will satisfy this particular demand for identification. Questions of regional style, communications and national pride will have to be studied with much greater understanding if satisfactions are to be gained on this level. The connection between programming and the physical result is not determined by analyses of popular taste or specific economic trends. The planner and the architect worry about popular taste which is always strong, wilful and seems to ignore their best efforts. Probably it is because the first two motivations that have been mentioned are ignored by planners that they rail against something they often consider vulgar. Certainly taste needs educating, but it cannot be denied by wrathful individuals who wish to be free of the mob. It is probably a sign of progress that it is no longer necessary to catch the butterfly of taste and pin it to your drawing board as Sir Gilbert Scott did so successfully in England and to a lesser extent the firm of McKim, Mead and White in this country. We have advanced from this position but are liable to go too far in another direction if we ignore the democratic process. Public taste is not the ephmeral thing it is supposed to be by disappointed architects. If people do not like a certain building it is more likely the building that is at fault, not the people. ' What is wrong with people is their temper, not their taste ; their patient and trustful temper, which lives in houses taken for granted and subscribes to public buildings from which it derives no enjoyment,' said Ruskin. Most people are happy enough with urban building and planning that has the quality of being sincere although they will break out into bizarre fancies if left to their own devices. It is obvious that complete license cannot be given to this tendency but if we believe that the city is a worthwhile expression of culture and art, if it is, in fact, a form of art, then allowances must be made for the infinite variety which a healthy art form is always producing. There must be room for houses with crystal stairways (or can only Texans afford them?), and for gardens lighted by natural gas, for ornamental plaster-work and for turrets and towers. Let us remember that just as 'good ' architecture will not produce a good society, neither will a ' good ' program necessarily produce desirable city forms. Art must have something to say in the process - art as an expression of man's basic needs and desires. The Position of the Civic Designer The skill which can put all this into focus has largely been forgotten. In the late Renaissance and until the mid-eighteenth century the shell of the town was developed by speculator and architect (sometimes combined in one and the same person): social institutions were commissioned by church and crown; cities and towns built de novo were designed by military engineers, architects,</page><page sequence="8">i9£i CHRISTOPHER TUNNARD 223 surveyors and amateurs of taste. In the eighteenth century municipal authorities multiplied and urbanism began to embrace the idea of * improvement'; street layout and street widening, lighting, waste disposal and bridge building slowly became a function of government rather than of private enterprise. Very little was thought about control of urban growth or problems of excess population until the nineteenth century when solutions like colonization, * utilitarian ' open space proposals and model factory villages began to appear as a result of urban congestion. In the middle of the century men first began to view the city as an entity, largely through the eyes of Ruskin whose interweaving of history, politics, art and life in recreating a city risen from the sea paved the way for later sociological, ethical and economic urban studies. Like Gounod's Faust, which now seems so very conventional an operatic form, the Stones of Venice established a new technique in the art of interpretation. The city was exposed before a society which had hitherto complained about it or ignored it but which now could not refuse to see it whole. Furthermore this particular city had died* and the awful thought that modern cities might not be permanent or the investment in them safe began to color the thinking of municipalities and citizens.2 Reform joined with improvement and by the end of the century the housing movement, conservation programs, and the movement for public health were well established. In the early years of the present century the function of the professional town planner was still fairly well denned. He was, although not always called so, a civic designer; very often he was an architect or a landscape architect who practised civic design. Daniel H. Burnham and Sir Raymond Unwin were typical professional men of this period. They operated within the framework of a program laid down by others, sometimes changing or modifying it to include amenities not specified by the promoters, as Olmsted did at Riverside when he included a central park along the Des Plaines River. These modifications were usually the result of the design process. Scientific and economic ideas came from outside ; from a Shaftesbury, a Howard, a Parliamentary Committee or a private corporation - and it was rarely that the town planner exceeded physical limits. It is true, of course, that the exigencies of city building often forced him into the role of entrepreneur and he who wishes to see a design project realized 1 The economy of Venice was revived by regional planning in 19 1 7 when, through the initiative of Giuseppe Volpi, the Italian government created the industrial port of Maghera. Volpi had organized the Societa Adriatica di Elettricita which impounded the Alpine waters to the north of Venice to produce power for all of north- eastern Italy. The port was begun in 19 19 and inaugurated in 1922 and has since expanded rapidly with oil refining, aluminium production (Jugoslav bauxite), finished steel products, machine works and shipbuilding, all taking advantage of the cheap and plentiful power. Today several of the largest dams in western Europe are about to be completed in the Eastern Alps, which will vastly increase the power potential. 2 ' The Queen would be sorry that Mr. Peabody should leave England without being assured by herself how deeply she appreciates the noble act of more than princely munificence by which he has sought to relieve the wants of her poorer subjects residing in London ' Letter from Queen Victoria, March 28, 1866 to George Peabody, quoted in The Life of the Late George Peabody , J. S. Bryant, London, 19 14. The building of the Peabody housing estates helped to relieve a critical shortage caused by the demolition of London slum dwellings to make way for the railways then entering the city.</page><page sequence="9">224 CREATIVE URBANISM October will presumably always have to be at the very least an accomplished tactician. Until the end of the first world war, however, decision-making or control was not the town planner's concern. When town planning became a function of government after 1910 the civic designer was put in an anomalous position. The sociologist, the social engineer, the economist, the lawyer and the political scientist - program-makers for physical planning and housing - began to take over some of his former design functions. Where facilities were to go, how the site was to be planned, types of street layout and even appearance were often predetermined. Specialists began to appear - highway traffic engineers, housing consultants and industrial experts reserved whole areas to themselves which the civic designer had once considered his own. Planning was becoming a much more complex affair and less and less of it was being translated directly into three-dimensional form. Also it was running in separated grooves which a proliferation of autonomous agencies had created in order to expedite their special programs. The civic designer and his patron had become separated by a spongy layer of ' experts ' which was absorbing much of the power of both older parties. This situation accounts for the varied definitions* of the planner's function which are current and the pretensions of many ' planners ' to assume powers that they might more modestly disown. It may be asked whether or not in a democratic society either the private owner or the proper branch of government acting for the people, as the case may be, can still be the originator and controller of the program for planning. If the answer is * yes ' (* no ' would surely be an invidious claim on the part of the planner) then the sandwich should be inspected for possible extraneous matter in the filling. It is likely that as a result of this inspection most functions exceeding the powers of research and interpretation of research or recommendation could be removed. The planner who is not a physical designer would then properly be called a technician also. Although he would certainly assist in * the making of informed decisions ' he would be relieved of the responsibility for them, which responsibility should rest squarely with the client or agent of the client, to whom alternate solutions would be presented. Planning on the technical level could thus properly be called the making of recommendations. Perhaps, as a gesture to tradition, the physical planner might be consulted at an earlier stage than is now sometimes fashionable, so that the alternatives might be more clearly envisaged. The hierarchy would appear something like the diagram on the opposite page. The ' administrative ' planner would not, of course, cease to exist; but he would be subject to directives. Administratives are required in any modern functional body, and not least in large planning organizations. It is probably 1 Representative definitions: (The Official City Planner), Harold Maclean Lewis, Planning the Modern City, New York, 1949. Vol. 1, p. 7.

Planning powers might be delegated to him by the client but would not exist on the technical level. This organization of the planning function would make clear-cut the role of the civic designer, restoring some of his early powers and reducing those of the socio-natural scientist. It would also prevent the assumption of specialized research powers by the civic designer who is very rarely qualified to undertake SOCIETY or Representative Segment CLIENT (Owner, corporation, institution, government agency) and MANAGER (Representative of Client) administrative A TECHNICAL CREATIVE DESIGNER V RESEARCH ANALYST (Civic or Regional) - &gt; RECOMMENDATIONS &lt;- with architects, landscape (Pooling &amp; fusion process) with natural and social architects, painters, sculp- scientists. tors craftsmen. them. Placing these last two functions on an equal footing to produce joint recommendations would undoubtedly improve the quality of these recom- mendations and where differences of opinion occurred the result would be more stimulating than harmful, as they might be on a higher level. Visual imagination could be fused with economic or social standards, for instance, as some of the better planning work of recent years has indeed shown. A permanent dualism on the technical level is inherent in this suggestion. It is not to be imagined by any but the most confirmed technocrat that in our complex modern society the designer can encompass the function of the analyst or vice versa. Each should of course know enough of the other's technique to develop a common language. Neither should make decisions, which are thrown back where they belong, to the client whose responsibility is to society itself. The ancient art of trying to influence the client could still with profit be employed; there is little to fear from irresponsibility, however, when society actually exercises its planning powers. Further it is desirable that no one in this organization on the technical level should call himself a * planner.' He might be a civic or regional designer (probably not both nowadays because there is a dualism implied here also) or an urban analyst (but preferably a sociologist or economist or whatever his basic discipline happens to be): this in spite of the fact that all will be engaged in the production of plans. The client, however, is the real planner - a most important</page><page sequence="11">226 CREATIVE URBANISM October distinction which is often forgotten and is only occasionally remembered when a day of reckoning arrives. It is absolutely essential for the future of planning that the client or program-maker be responsible for all important decisions, regardless of any unwillingness to assume this role. This enables a democratic society to fix responsibility clearly, unhindered by the mysteries of technical jargon or drafting technique. It is obvious that the client will have to be better informed than he sometimes is now in order to arrive at a proper decision ; but decision-making, right or wrong, remains his task. The Necessity for a Creative Approach We are concerned here with the civic designer, whose position has been clouded by circumstances. We should prefer to see him take his place in the sun. Who will doubt his value to society in an age which has rediscovered the city, which exalts civic virtue and which concentrates its entire powerful cultural apparatus within the city limits ? It cannot be too strongly emphasized that we are discussing ' visual ' planning not drawingboard planning. In this we are following the advice of Sitte ; although it is not necessary to agree with all the principles of visual planning expressed in Der Stddtebau nach seinen kiinstlerischen GrundsdtzenJ The term ' visual planning ' is undeniably limiting and savors of esthetic caprice, * forced spontaneity J and trick devices intended to appeal to the eye alone. The term third-dimensional planning is much better but even this can be interpreted as referring to the shell of the community. We have chosen the term creative urbanism to describe the new approach and the objects which should result from this approach may be called the product of creative design. Creative Urbanism is the product of the pooling process already described which should take place between the natural and social scientist on one side and the creative urban designer on the other. The knowledge, skills and techniques which can be employed here are too numerous to mention. But some indication of the creative designer's technique should be outlined here. The creative designer should presumably have a background in the arts although it is not essential that this be so if the artistic talent, notably freehand drawing and drafting, can be developed rapidly while the designer is taking his professional courses. Architecture is an excellent background and one which has the merit of traditional acceptance and a record of success. Landscape architecture, painting, sculpture, and the graphic arts are all useful preliminary disciplines. It will be noticed that engineering which should be considered as a science is not included; this is not out of disrespect for the achievements of engineers. It is merely due to the fact that in our suggested organization engineering appears among the natural and social sciences. It is logical enough that the engineer, or the lawyer, or the political scientist can become a creative designer if his inclinations and talents veer in that direction. 1 Sitte's anti-Haussmann crusade denies us a proper analysis of the plan rayonnant of which the Baron was a crude imitator.</page><page sequence="12">i9£i CHRISTOPHER TUNNARD 227 The skills and knowledge that should be acquired by the creative designer include some things which are at present minimized in planning curricula. One is the sense of tradition which must be particularly sympathetic to the ways and manners of our social background. Designers who look on the city as ' a market, a place to work, an arena for the ambitious, a passage way ' as Haussmann did or as a place in which a break with the past must at all costs be made are not designers at all and are better classed as technocrats. Second, the designer must have at his fingertips an artistic resource which he may not have obtained during his training in architecture or the other creative arts. This is a knowledge and understanding of the role that art plays in social institutions and physical surroundings. It is essential that a knowledge of the arts, of decoration, wall painting, the use of water, greenery and even interior decoration should be part of the creative designer's body of knowledge on the theory that the minor arts, as they used to be called, must be re-integrated with urban life. Beyond that the designer must be made sensitive to atmospheres, ephemeral qualities in the landscape and to accoustic problems, all of which demand special training or application. Third, and here * visual planning ' becomes an apt term, questions of scale and proportion, apparent size and other relations must be thoroughly studied, not only in the way that Sitte describes but especially in relation to problems of density and economics suggested by the social scientist. We talk glibly about density, bulk, coverage, flow, area and illumination without any knowledge of the effects of our standards established for them on design, except in a very mechanical way. These mechanical standards have done a great deal to produce uniformity of a very unimaginative kind. We must know better what we are doing in establishing such standards and where we can break away from the uniform monotony which is deadening civic design by its too rigid application.1 How does the creative designer approach the city? An older method was to ' take strategic points and prolong them on far- distant points of view, ' as Domenico Fontana demonstrated in Rome at the end of the sixteenth century or as L'Enfant did in planning Washington. Elbert Peets has called this ' esthetic engineering.'2 Lethaby suggested its application to London in 1 896 in a proposal which has never been carried out, although it has all the simplicity of a great logic. i Take the golden bow,' he says, * the curve of the river from Westminster Abbey to St. Paul's Cathedral; Waterloo Bridge bisects this curve and if you draw a line from the end of the bridge straight ahead through crowded London, you will find it leads straight to the British Museum.'

Southward the line of the bridge projected hits the Obelisk which is the point in the center of a star of roads in south London. This line, he says, should be the axis of modern London; make it iiito an avenue, broad, and the center planted with green, lined with the statues of London's great men - Erkenwald, London's forgotten saint, Mayors Fitz Alwin, Fitz Thomas and Walter Harvey, Bishop Braybrook and Stow, the humble chronicler, London's poet Chaucer and Christopher Wren, the first and last great architect. Create a square in front of the museum into which would jut Hawksmoor's Church, and move the Egyptian Monument now on the embankment to stand in the square's center, placing a golden milestone where this new cord intersects the Strand. Lethaby's idea, of course, is colored by the planning theories of his time but it is his boldness which would have provided something that London has always needed, namely direct communication between north and south, and the river becoming a life-line of the town. This imaginativeness is the element that we have lost in city planning since we have let those who call themselves practical men take over. Where is such imagination to be found in the plans of London made since his time, many of whose features were forecast by Lethaby (the green belt in 1896 was one of his pioneering ideas)? What Lethaby was really proposing, and what we must now propose, when we have educated ourselves to do it, is to reapply the visual approach - the approach that the arts had and which the architect and city planner have lost in the rush of the auto- mobile to our modern cities. We have tried the scientific approach, which sometimes results in an improvement and sometimes merely proliferates our troubles as New York's highway system has done. This approach is lacking in something; that is the trouble with having * limited objectives.' It is lacking in the quality of imagination which will stir people and give them something they can point to with pride.

Where would urbanism be - where is it - without Phidias, Giotto and Michelangelo ?

You may try to make cities more livable and nobody will thank you for it. There are probably no thanks due, because the aim of making cities livable does not necessarily include what Julian Huxley has called ' our next step in civilization ' - the positive attempt to make our environment a work of art. Now art is something like yeast which should be fermenting all the time in the lives of our citizens and it is automatic when people are trained in art and in the appreciation of art. This is a matter, of course, for our schools and we are beginning to see in this generation the results of including the arts in the grade and high school curriculum. New methods of art teaching have heightened our perceptions and we now know more about color and form at least in the world of painting than we did once. Although you may think it difficult to bring the art point of view to bear on cities when it seems so difficult to solve even their most pressing problems, it is possible that if we include the art approach as part of our daily thinking then our practical solutions may change in character and become a better fusion of form and function, of the practical and aesthetic. The Greeks were certainly practical people but art was so automatic with them that it didn't even have to be discussed and they built beautiful cities. The traders of the Orient, businessmen though they were, developed standards of art for their caravan cities, like Palymyra in the desert, which have seldom been surpassed. We who are presumably much better businessmen but certainly are not following in their footsteps as beautifiers of cities should with our infinitely greater financial resources, be able to combine business and art to a higher degree than it was possible for these earlier peoples. * If absolute monarchs,' Thomas Sharp has pointed out, ' were able to plan complexes we now admire, why cannot we with our greater wealth and technique plan admirable complexes for ourselves? ' Art does not spring full-blown from a society, neither will our cities blossom with the forms of art unless we consciously apply them but as architects and planners we must make a beginning and that beginning ought to be, in the writer's opinion, a visual re-education which will enable us to see again the city in three dimensions instead of two. The civic designer must be able to visualize the problems of third-dimensional form and space in a new way, because the success or failure of his art will depend on relationships. Daniel Burnham, the Chicago architect, surprised the Chicago speculators by saying that the problem of that city was the relationship of all buildings to each other and unless we understand these relationships we are never going to plan cities which will have a measure of appeal. Since then, Lewis Mumford has taught us to look at the city as a whole organism - as a totality - but a totality is only the sum of its parts and in examining it what we now choose to call * the living organism ' of the city, defining its sprawl and zoning its functions, the problem of relationships in a visual sense has been overlooked. Take the city plan that we have today. We know the various two-dimensional forms which make it up. The orthogonal or rectilinear plan which reads like</page><page sequence="27">23o CREATIVE URBANISM October a palindrome, the same either backwards or forwards; the radio concentric plan which is typified by parts of Paris but which is not lacking either in Washington, Buffalo or Detroit; the curvilinear plan which has become since the days of Olmsted more popular with suburban developers and the linear or spinal plan in which the main parts of the city are laid out along an artery of transportation. These are the four main forms that cities have used through the ages and the modern city has more or less absorbed them all. We know of their persistence, of the fact that the rectilinear plan has been used since the days of the Egyptians and the radio concentric plan by their neighbours and rivals the Hittites and we know of their interrelationships with the art of every period ; that the pattern of the hunting forests was similar to the pattern of the streets of Paris and similar to the designs to be found on certain fabrics ; that today the shapes invented by the painter Arp are used to fashion pavements and the surroundings of hotels in pleasure resorts. These forms may be called significant for the art historians but they are not necessarily productive of stimulation in city planning since they conform merely to arteries of communication and are not usually readable to the eye, the scale of the city being so large. Furthermore, since they are well recognized art forms, planners have had a tendency to use them unrelated to the land or the demands of the site. A plan is nothing in itself but a convenience - it has no beauty of its own - but it is worse than useless if it ignores the site, as the grid does on the hills of San Francisco. These two-dimensional plans very rarely have a social basis and this is understandable because a pattern which was devised for easy land sale or transfer or for promenading in the cool of the evening on en carosse is not related to the social needs of our own time. A better relationship could be developed perhaps by taking the social, historical or economic unit and planning our city around that. These units we will call related areas. It is, of course, in our sought-for relationships and in detail that the power of art becomes enormous and this power is today unrealized (as is even the power of science. What we are doing to cities in the name of science is not scientific at all. We could use scientific knowledge to a much greater extent than we have, even in the visual approach, where the size of the angle in the field of vision becomes important and the difference between real and apparent size of buildings can be measured by scientific formulae.) Nothing, however, is purely visual. Questions of memory, hope and purpose enter into our vision of cities and that is where art and knowledge of art are so important. In training ourselves to see the city and its relationships, we must also take into account social and philosophic problems of symbolism, for instance, and what the city means to people in its visible form. In America we place tall buildings at the center; perhaps that was a good beginning when we didn't crowd the centers too much by doing so. But we complicated our problem by dwarfing our important earlier buildings with the skyscraper. Nothing is more ridiculous than the beautiful Independence Hall in Philadelphia, one of our very best architectural inheritances, dwarfed by the Curtis Publishing Company and other tall buildings</page><page sequence="28">i9$i CHRISTOPHER TUNNARD 231 around.1 Perhaps these taller buildings instead of crowding the civic area should have been a little further out so that a cup-shaped center in elevation could have been established.2 In any case, the indiscriminate mingling of business and civic buildings, granted that it is hard to separate the functioning of business from administration, should be discouraged, particularly because our newer civic buildings, like libraries, schools, museums and hospitals are tending to lower and lower heights. How can we give these complexes any scale? The Greek Temple had an absolute progression of scale and had very little relationship to man which was, of course, the intention. When a bigger Greek Temple was built it had a bigger door, not a man-sized door; unlike the Gothic Cathedral in which however large the edifice, the entrance was always cut to man's measure. We have completely lost any feeling for scale in our modern work. In fact, we are in danger of creating buildings which are as inhuman as machines and of a scale which is unrecognizable because it cannot be related to anything we know. The attempt of designers to use trees to give scale to tall buildings is meaningless since the trees are lost against a skyscraper as they are, for instance, in the approach to Rockefeller Center. Trees are effective, however, where architecture is man-scale and seen beyond roofs as a background or below them as a foil for their virtues. Even cobblestones and bricks have to be carefully watched but they can give scale too and the pattern of your paving to the observant eye is as important as your structure. Watch all detail carefully and avoid huge scaleless walls or avenues which stretch beyond a mile in length and which the eye quickly tires of. The arch gives scale and our best known example is in Venice where two centuries may separate the doges' palace from Sansovino's library and yet the arch on both gives the required integration of the Piazzetta. What, may be asked at this point, is the module for today? We can span a thousand feet without intervening supports in our modern construction but the space between will not be vacant and it will not, let us hope, be continuous glass than which under certain conditions nothing is visually more unpleasant. We were not meant to make walls into windows beyond a certain point and we must scale down the interstices between our structural elements so as to avoid the unfortunate error of approaching a building and finding nothing there. We must also avoid the dichotomy between the two scales that our American building has lately produced. If you come into New York over the Pulaski Skyway, you get a good example of this - the small rows of houses on the New Jersey side which look like Walt Disney cottages for gnomes against the towers of Manhattan behind and against the bridge itself. This, of course, is accidental 1 Professor George Howe, Chairman of the Department of Architecture, Yale University, after reading a rough draft of this article, has pointed out that while the example cited is certainly incongruous, the com- bination of gigantic and small buildings is sometimes accidentally successful, as in the view of Trinity Church, along the canyon of Wall Street in New York. He offers as his personal opinion the suggestion that our cities have fewer planning controls and more "accident control " i.e. a guarantee that the incongruities of American city building can be made a point of departure by imaginative " architect-planners." 2 The writer is indebted to Hans Blumenfeld of the Philadelphia City Planning Commission for this suggestion, made in a lecture on Scale in City Planning at Yale University in January, 19^1.</page><page sequence="29">232 CREATIVE URBANISM October but as planners we are faced with the same relative problem since the economic and social requirements of our building industry demand buildings of one or two stories and buildings above eleven stories with nothing in-between; so even in the less dramatic areas of our cities we are faced with this problem of two scales and it is hard to achieve a happy relationship. (See Figure No. 17). A happy effect in small towns has often been achieved but in the large city with its triumphs of engineering and its increasing separation of functions we are faced with the task of relating plane and dimensions in which, perhaps, we need the advice and the eye of the painter. These problems can be studied in schools of art, town planning and archi- tecture; in fact they must be studied there since obviously traffic engineers and efficiency experts are not going to bother with them. By using models we shall be able to make a study of scale relationships and also of color and ornament, as Louis Sullivan did - and let me remind you that if Sullivan is your god it is wise to accept him whole - ornament and all. You do not have to be an architect to solve the problems of civic design - although architects have a very firm foundation for becoming civic designers. All you need as a beginning is an ability to grasp a large problem and to comprehend certain fundamentals of massing and lay-out. But we shall need everyone and a study of all the art skills for the question of detail and if you look at the great urban complexes of history, the ones that we can all admire you will find that they are rich in detail, in subtlety and in light and shade. It is often the case that we can judge the complex from its smallest parts. Even the waste paper blowing through the streets gives us a clue to the regard for art which a community holds. How high do you rate the importance of detail? It must be reintroduced and the craftsmen again remembered. Clean lines, balanced masses, and open space are not enough. Like a cathedral which has the work of many people in its fabric, the city square and the residential court must show the evidence of many hands. The creative designer must start, then, with proper relationships as his aim. Suppose that a new town is under consideration. Having been assured that the premises are correct* or having quarreled with them until a satisfactory analytic base is arrived at, knowing the number of square feet to be given to this and that, understanding that certain spaces must be reserved for industry and others for civic use, the designer can begin, not to make a plan - this is our objection to the term * planner ' - but to visualize in groups certain parts of the coming city as they will appear in three dimensions. The civic designer is not necessarily assuming the role of architect here, although he may be one by training, but he certainly is adopting the vision of a painter or sculptor trained in perspective and dimension. Growing from the site on strategic points of ground are seen the one or more centers of industry, of commerce, of govern- ment, of pleasure, of health, of religion - each with its embryonic form and character. The actual form is variable and of patterns on the ground there are 1 That the civic designer may still be required to make his own assumptions, especially with regard to ultimate size, is suggested by G. D. H. Cole, op. cit., pp. 28-29.</page><page sequence="30">i9£i CHRISTOPHER TUNNARD 233 :ig. 22 - An approach to creative jr ban ism through the revitalisation of ■elated areas, described in a report by :he writer of this article to the mayor of Jarranquilla, Republic of Colombia A. An area containing two connecting squares, both in need of rehabilitation, around which the financial district will be expanded and the old market rebuilt B. An area of culture and entertainment, to contain the new cathedral, municipal theatre and civic buildings C. An area of hotels, tourism and tropical gardens D. Areas of new residences for a population which is due to double its size in fifty years E. An area of industry. All these areas are chosen for study because of a dominant character or use. All can be defined and related through creative design. An architectural character, scale, heights and density is being suggested for each area a thousand possibilities ; but the forms will already have a quality stamped by variety in height, in vertical and horizontal emphasis, in looseness or compactness of structure. Now the strategic sites will be connected one to another, perhaps outward from a main center, perhaps in linear fashion, perhaps in a loose series of sub- centers without strong formality. This does not mean that a traffic pattern is being established. The connections may be merely vistas, or linked shopping streets, or pedestrian bridges or tree lined malls all planned with the eye in three dimensions.1 The traffic pattern will probably be separated from all of these 1 The separate but connecting elements planned by the Woods and the development of Bathwick are good examples of this approach.</page><page sequence="31">234 CREATIVE URBANISM October sites, its shape dictated by science and its connection with the centers peripheral ; darting in to make contact where it is needed but never interfering with the main functions of the city. A parallel with the siting of a house might be given here. The house is sited on the land for views, exposures, and relation to its neighbors ; the driveway and other approaches are then planned to serve it. The house is never sited to fit nicely at the end of an already planned driveway ; if it were, the other amenities would probaMy be sacrificed. Traffic dominates the city now; the strangulation point has almost been reached; and it cannot be too strongly emphasized that it is folly to base the new city on the demands of traffic. Traffic ways should only be an accom- modation, a convenience for the citizen. Such an attitude is necessary now that the mechanization of transport is in an advanced stage. It will be argued that in all existing cities this approach would be impossible, the street pattern being already fixed. But is it? What city in the United States is without a new highway or cut-off which has been designed to feed yet avoid the important centers of town? Highway engineers will explain that this is their policy- to separate through traffic from local traffic - an admirable plan, which unfortunately cannot change the cities by itself. Perhaps the theory of related areas will prove useful in giving a positive direction to this trend. Applied to existing centers (which should be re-examined in the process in order to develop a three-dimensional quality) the theory will prove that the approach should be the same for replanning an old town - to determine the strategic points and relate them to each other. Here, through historical accident or economic trend, strategic areas are sometimes poorly situated, and that makes the task harder, but it will often be found that over the years the city has created its own landscape and that certain areas have acquired through man's activities an interest which they did not at first possess. It will be found that these can be related by the formation of approaches, opening up of views or the creation of parks ; at least no one should despair if at first sight the city seems to have no strategic points. They are always there, even though hidden, and a proper study of traditions, economic, social and artistic, will reveal their identity. This theory does not depend for its application on sites of great beauty or variety. The dull, flat bottom-lands are a greater challenge than Tivoli or Santa Fe. Granted that many American cities have been founded along rivers subject to flooding, on land better suited to agricultural pursuits - these were mistakes of the past and at great expense through regional or local control they are being made safe for the future. So there they are and will remain. A comparatively flat site can afford the magnificence of taller buildings at strategic points and the pleasures of open space - Wordsworth's * haunts of ease ' - a city on a flat site is not limited as to its extent or hemmed in by rough topography and in it can be created, as many of the Latin countries like Mexico have done, the minor pleasures of building around courts and connecting court with court</page><page sequence="32">i9£i CHRISTOPHER TUNNARD 23^ by links of open space - one of the positive advantages of a flat site over a hilly one. It may be pointed out that these strategic points are but islands in our cities of congestion and decay. This is quite evident; they are also jewels in the crown in which the velvet becomes a modest background to set off the glitter of the more important gems. If the velvet is worn and frayed it too must be rewoven. The pattern is quiet - residential areas cover by far the greatest amount of land - but minor jewels are shining here - the neighborhood center, the libraries, the local markets. If you give people something to be proud of, or better still, help them to create something they can admire, the influence will spread to homes and grounds in the manner that Jefferson hoped for when he suggested a way in which cities should grow. A deep-seated desire can be realized through creative urbanism. A new generation is tired of our endless streets with their wretched sameness, with their gas station on every corner, with the chain store repeating its endless pattern from coast to coast. No wonder they crowd into Stratford-on-Avon or Williamsburg, where picturesqueness, detail, glimpses of history, architecture, or anything else they can find there offer a welcome change from their deadeningly remorseless surroundings. 1 Planning in three dimensions instead of two demands a new technique. The result, if translated onto paper, does not resemble anything we now make in the form of a city plan. Palladio's Teatro Olimpico does not read in plan at all. Questions of memory, hope and visual pleasure can only be rendered by the artist and to him we must turn for the new technique. We train too many * practical ' men - what errors are committed in the name of practicality! - and too few artists. Divorce sculpture, painting and - unthinkable but true, even architecture from city planning - reduce it to a practical working-out of traffic flow and correct land use, and what is left ? Not a city, surely. The city is supposed to rise upon this base, but it will be an unimaginative thing, a perpetuation of past errors in modern form. The method proposed will start with the third dimension, the ultimate form - the creative designer working with the scientist and analyst to produce the common aim - a city, which may, for once, be called * beautiful ' in all dimensions. Our creative designer, then - we must start to train him now since even Michaelangelo would be frustrated in the modern city and there is everything to learn - our new man will be relieved of the responsibility for making decisions. His client, the people, will receive his recommendations, - solutions exhaustively worked out with the collaboration of clinical experts. He will be a visual expert, an artist in the form of cities, and aware of the contribution which others must make if we are to live in communities which achieve an integration of art and life. He must know what tradition means - otherwise there is no point of departure. He must develop the quality of imagination which can seize on 1 Professor Robert Weinberg of New York University has suggested in a discussion of this point with the writer that the orderliness of civic groupings of former times has an underlying appeal which is of greater importance in estimating public response than questions of style or period.</page><page sequence="33">236 CREATIVE URBANISM October insignificant-seeming things and make them into magical touchstones of urbanism ; but he must not be arrogant or cocksure - Emerson taught us that the observer should be included in every creative act. With this democratic ideal before him, the creative designer may perhaps achieve a measure of success in that market place beyond economics, the city born of art. * * * The Town and Country Planning Association arranged a Tour of Austria in conjunction with the Austrian Institute of Architects and Planners in August of this year and 3$ people availed themselves of the opportunity to visit major industrial projects and to study planning schemes and housing estates in all parts of the country. Travel was by way of boat and train to Bludenz in the west of Austria and thence by bus through the towns of Innsbruck, Kitzbuhel, Villach, Graz, Vienna, Linz, and Salzburg. In Austria planning is not yet supported by comprehensive planning law, but it is believed that this will soon be forthcoming. Nevertheless there was much to be seen in the detailed surveys and projected plans that were on view in the towns visited. Regional planning is well advanced as was realised from the excellent talks that were given throughout the tour. Housing, hampered by limited resources, proceeds, the housing shortage being aggravated by the influx of refugees from Eastern Europe. Perhaps some idea of the problem that confronts the war-damaged city of Vienna, may be given by the fact that 70 per cent of the dwellings are single-room apartments. New housing estates on the fringe of the city reveal rather lower space standards than those in Britain but, on the other hand, building standards are extraordinarily high. Of the industrial projects visited the hydro -electric works at Kaprun in the heart of the Glockner region of the Tirol provided the greatest excitement and interest. The magnificence of site of the dam works high up in the mountains must be unsurpassed and the ascent via underground funicular and tunnel to the dam wall, 400 ft. high, was in itself an unforgettable experience. At all the places visited the party, led by F. J. Osborn, was entertained with lavish hospitality culminating in a civic luncheon given by the Burgomaster of Vienna and a dinner party given by the architects of Vienna. The time and trouble taken by all those connected with the arrangements of the tour were fully appreciated by the members taking part.</page></plain_text>
