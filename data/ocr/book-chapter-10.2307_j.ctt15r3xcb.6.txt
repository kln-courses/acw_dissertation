In  1815, he married an heiress, Annabella Milbanke,  but the marriage was unhappy from the start.  Conjectures about his incestuous relationship with  his half-sister Augusta Leigh, combined with his  wife’s complaints of his dark moods of cruelty and  despair, made separation inevitable. (His daughter  Ada became Countess of *Lovelace.) Ostracised by  many of his former admirers, Byron left England  for good in 1816 and moved to Switzerland, where  he spent happy weeks with the Shelleys. From a  life of dissipation and promiscuous love affairs in  Venice (1817-19), Byron was rescued by Teresa,  Countess Guiccioli, a woman of cultivated tastes  who became his mistress. In this Italian period he  finished Childe Harold and among other writings  produced the drama Manfred (1817), Beppo (1818)  and A Vision of Judgement (1822). He also began  Don Juan (1819-24), that extraordinary medley  of satire, adventure and self-revelation which  remained unfinished at his death. Byron’s interest  in the cause of freeing Greece from Turkish rule led  him to join the liberation committee in 1823. He set  out for Greece later in the year; the following April  he died of fever at Missolonghi. For much of the  19th century he was regarded as the epitome of the  romantic hero, a noble, melancholy wanderer and  a passionate lover of freedom, but this judgement,  based on his early poems, is largely the creation of  his admirers (and in some moods of himself). The  truer Byron, repressed in youth and always aware  of his deformity, was much more of a satirist in the  tradition of *Voltaire, an ironical realist as little  blind to his own failings as to those of others, as  aware of the savagery, squalor and tedium of life as  of its beauty and glory.
