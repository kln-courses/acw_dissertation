Entwicklungsstadien im altmesopotamischen Pantheon dargestellt am Präanthropomorphem kur und an der Hauptgottheit áen . lil2 (Innsbrucker Beiträge zur Kulturwissenschaft.

Institut für vergleichende Sprachwissenschaft der Leopold- Franzens-Universität, Innsbruck. - The author's thesis is that Mesopotamian anthropomorphic theology was preceded by a period of totemism centered in the clan; this earlier stage is said to be typified by the cult of the numen kur, a pre-Sumerian word meaning "stone, heap of stones" (p. 81-83), "Steinheiligtum" (p. 65 f.). This thesis is based on comparative anthropological data (p. 8-56) and on a review of the textual evidence for kur (p. 62-84) and the god Enlil (p. 84-1 15), whose worship is said to have superseded and become melded with that of kur. Study of Sumerian religion in the light of general anthropology and religious history is of course a welcome heuristic and comparative procedure, provided hypotheses based on comparative material are con- trolled by rigorous appeal to the written sources. In the present book, textual material is not always interpreted with sufficient regard for the available evidence. The existence of a pre-Sumerian word kur, with a meaning not attested in the lexical or bilingual texts, is deduced from contexts in which the "negative" sense of Sumerian kur does not fit (p. 65 f.i, but the exclusively negative sense of the Sumerian word is an unexamined supposition. In SGI, I, No. 1:10 and elsewhere, the tra- ditional translation of an-ki, "heaven (and) earth", is replaced "unter Berufung auf die d/š/s- Alternation im Sumerischen" by the trans- lation "Sumer", with the explanation that d i m m e rkl = š i m e rki = š u m e rkl = k e n g i rki (p. 7 1 and 93) . We are told that ù-lul(-la) "ein ursprüngliches *'ll wiedergeben will, ebenso wie áen . lil2 eine sumerische Form von *'ll darstellt", and that k u - k u may serve as a writing of kur-kur; a-a dm u - u 1 - 1 i 1 ù-lul-la k u - k u is there- fore translated "Vater Mullil, (Numen) *7/ aller kur" (p. 101), despite the (unmentioned) Akkadian version Ša salai sarrãti sallu (cf. CAD S 67b). Such interpretations do not recommend themselves; on a yet more fun- damental level, the reservations expressed by J. van Dijk (OLZ 62 [1967] 229-244, esp. 237-243) to a proposed succession of totemistic and anthropomorphic cult in Sumer are not considered.
