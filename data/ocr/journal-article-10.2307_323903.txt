<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS ty of Western European culture and civilization reaching their culmination in the Cross of Christendom in the last story of the cycle, "The Holy Father Blesses." Parandowski wrote only one novel as such, which may be taken as something of a curiosity for a man who voices such strong support for the traditional novel form, although he does admit of late to a certain impatience with the necessity of working out narrative forms for his subjects. In any case, his one novel, Heaven in Flames (1935) is outstanding. It is generally regarded as his highest achievement and certainly should be translated into English even though the early 50's with the popularity then of Salinger and of James Dean's role in "Rebel Without a Cause" probably were the most fertile ground for reception of Parandowski's rebel. Of course Parandowski's young hero rebels for a specific reason, a crisis of faith in God and the Catholic Church. Still, the resulting malaise spills over into his whole life, thus making for more similarity with a Holden Caulfield, for example. Particularly successful is Parandowski's picture of the complex, flawed, compromised, hypocritical, and out- and-out selfish responses of adults, both lay and clergy, to the challenge and honest questioning of the young hero. In this novel Parandowski presents a world in which the most honest are the least successful, where honesty is traded off for success in the bureaucracies of church and state. The only reservation I have about Professor Harjan's over-all excellent introduction to Parandowski, which is clearly a labor of love, is that he fails to bring Parandowski the man, the creative personality, across to the reader. He obviously knows well, respects deeply, and has great personal affection for Parandowski, so that this failure seems paradoxical. Parandowski is clearly a reticent man, and this reticence is seemingly compounded by Mr. Har- jan's own reserve, so that by the end of this study we do not have much of a "feel" of the man. Perhaps this is an unavoidable pitfall in writing about a living author for whom one has such deep respect and affection. The reserve here does however seem to extend overmuch to Paran- dowski's creative personality, aesthetics, and philosophy of art. Whereas we read, for example, that Parandowski was constantly preoccupied with questions about the problems of the writer and his function in society and life (p. 113), works where these questions are specifically taken up, such as Alchemy of the Word (1951) are not granted much discussion, with the result that the reader is not left in much of a position to assess Parandowski's answers to these questions. FRANK J. CORLISS, JR. Wayne State University GERBER, ADOPH. Great Russian Animal Tales. A Collection of Fifty Tales. New York: Burt Franklin, 1970. Pp. 112. $12.50. Originally published in 1891, that is, before the great comprehensive inventories of folktales had been prepared but after the appearance of Kaarle Krohn's monograph on the Wolf-Bear-Fox "folktale-chain" in Northern Europe, this book contains fifty tales abridged and translated from the German of Leskien. It will, therefore, be most read nowadays as a supplement to the relevant sections of M. Wosien's work on Russian folktales (Munich, 1969). In his introduction Gerber proposes to single out the evident parallels with medieval literary manifestations of the stories and, as an innovation in his day, to isolate in a synopsis all the instances of agglomeration of simple adventure-episodes and their transferences from tale to tale. These are the now well-known "functions" of V. Propp and "emic units" of A. Dundes, in an older guise. The introduc- tion goes on to examine questions of origins, of polygenesis and of hypothetical "original form," concluding that practically all Russian animal tales were primitively non- Russian. One may note that theories of origins are still being surveyed in our own day, especially well in K. H. Jackson's work on Welsh tales (Cardiff, 1961). A generation after Gerber, Von Sydow was to suggest that it is always the less cultured and urbanized peoples who are likely to show a preponderance of animal-tales as against other species of folktale, and that other beings-demons or folk-heroes-"convert" to animals in simpler societies when the original tale has been accepted. The leading animal-characters in Gerber's selection are Krohn's three-the Fox being always female-and the Cat, presented always as male. Quite recently Fritz Harkort [Fabula, 9 (1967)] has made speculations about the animal folktale which are in line with attempts to get away from the inventory, in the direction of a study of the psychological and cultural forces which produce the folktale and keep it in being. So it is that he presents the animal tale as the oldest of all the types, dating back to the earliest cultures of hunters and food-gatherers. Such primitives would inevitably amass information about the beasts they hunted and the predators which were their competitors for food, and only after civilized diversification did other types of wisdom exert influence on storytelling. At that point the animal folktales were progressively supplanted. For this reason they are not so much a special kind, when they are recorded in later ages, as survivals from times when the whole of storytelling implied the presenta- tion of beasts as characters. The anthropomorphism of animals in folktales has, therefore, its origin in the primitive's observation that animals and men share many potentialities and have to obey an identical law of necessity. This observation perhaps underlies the lack of didacticism to be extracted from true animal folktales, as a contrast with the sophisticated Aesopic story which has most affinities with the proverb. Usually they tell of one animal-character duping another, or perhaps misjudging his intelligence and failing to dupe him. Frequently the context is of explicitly sexual outrage. There is consequently no reinforcement of any moral code, and the teller of animal folktales merely invites the hearers to agree with him that the world is full of vanity. We may applaud those who come off best at duping their fellows as we would the winner of a riddling-contest or a field-game. Mere exposure to the trend of folktale of this comic kind will in time inculcate a kind of ethic. As an appendix to his collection Gerber provides a summary of the plot of Lisa Patrikjevna, an epic elaborated in 1882 by A. MoZarovskij from selected Fox-and-Man tales. There is additionally a useful table of cross-references with collections of tales from all over the world which were extant in 1891. ALAN SOONS Rice University 66</page></plain_text>
