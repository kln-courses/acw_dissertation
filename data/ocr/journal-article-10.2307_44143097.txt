<plain_text><page sequence="1">175 ORIGIN OF THE TIRTHANKARA IMAGE (SUMMARY) ANAND CHANDRA SAHOO * The Jaina tradition speaks of twenty-four tirthankaras beginning with Rishabhanatha, to Mahavira. It has been claimed that Jinism was a religion of eternity and was reformed from time to time by the tirthankaras. However, historians do not agree to accept all the tirthankaras as historical personages. Vardhamana Mahavira, the last tirthankara , has occupied a position of prominence in Jinism. Like his junior contemporary, Gautama Buddha, Mahavira never spoke of any kind of worship. After the attainment of nirvana, the tirthankaras neither care for, nor have any influence on temporal affairs. Neverthe- less, they became the objects of worship and came to be regarded as deva. In course of time temples were erected on the places where the idols of the tirthankaras were worshipped. Subsequently all the tirthankaras have been provided with their yakshas, yakshinis and lanchana. The present paper attempts to explain the beginning of the worship of the tirthankara images. In this regard, primarily archaeological evidence has been taken into account. The paper contains two sections. Section one deals with the anthropomorphic stage in Jaina iconography. In this section we have taken note of the typical Jaina symbols which had been worshipped before the emergence of the anthropomorphic forms. Although these symbols are not exclusively peculiar to Jinism, yet they have their significance in the history of Jaina iconography. In section two, we have tried to analyse the archaeological findings particularly * AM-14420, Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology, Vishvabharati, Shantiniketan.</page><page sequence="2">Proceedings, UIC : 54th Session, 1993 from Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, which had been a great Jaina centre. Innumerable ayagapatas have been found from Ka≈àkali Tila at Mathura. We have ventured to analyse some of the key ayagapatas in the context of the origin of tirthankara images. While doing so, we have also taken into account the interpretation of several scholars, including those who associate Jaina sculptures with the Indus and Mauryan periods. 910</page></plain_text>
