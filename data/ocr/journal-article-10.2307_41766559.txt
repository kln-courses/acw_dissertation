Until recently, few people outside Peru had the opportunity to see these magnificent artifacts. Now a collaborative effort by UCLA's Fowler Museum of Cul- tural History, the Brüning Museum in Lambayeque, and the Peruvian government has brought these remarkable antiquities to North Americans. For the next two years, the exhibition Royal Tombs of Sipán will tour the United States. The proceeds of the show will enable the Brüning Museum to build a permanent home for the treasures. The Moche kingdom was a small polity by the standards of, say, ancient Egypt or the Aztec empire of Mexico. Between the first and eighth centuries A.D. Moche lords presided over a series of coastal riv- er valleys spanning a north-south distance of about 350 miles. The Moche were masters of irrigation farming and fishing. They traded with people living far beyond the narrow confines of their own state, importing lapis lazuli from Chile and valuable Spondylus shells from Continued on page 58 12 Archaeology</page><page sequence="2">M ode I of the Lord of Sipán clasps a scepter bearing a scene of ritual sacrifice. ã fe z g ü 0 s g D S 2 1 o ü Continued from page 12 Ecuador. Moche lords treasured tropical bird feathers and forest ani- mals such as monkeys and boa con- strictors. Like other ancient Andean rulers, they received food and other commodities from their subjects, and redistributed this wealth to nobles of lesser rank. Enormous food surpluses supported full-time artisans, who created rare and pres- tigious objects for a privileged nobil- ity. Though Moche craftspeople were expert weavers and metalworkers, they were, above all, potters, arguably the best in Precolumbian America. They developed techniques not only for molding and stamping clay ves- sels, but also for painting complex scenes on bowls, pots, and vessels. Their artists painted intricate scenes of elaborately costumed figures engaged in hunting, fighting, and important religious ceremonies. Many of the finest pots have ended up in private U.S. collections. Until the excavations at Sipán, Moche archaeology was a frustrating salvage operation. Much of our knowledge of the Moche was based on looted arti- facts rather than study of undisturbed graves or stratified village sites. Christopher Donnan, director of the Fowler Museum and a leading authority on Moche art, iconogra- phy, and ceramics, has spent his entire career studying these ceram- ics, building a photographic archive of all known Moche vessels, whether in private or public collections. His research is a combination of detec- tive and salvage work - tracking down vanished masterpieces and poring over three-dimensional por- trait jars kept in private collections and storerooms. Donnan has been criticized for befriending collectors and studying their collections, on the grounds that such activity by archaeologists encourages even more frenzied looting. In fact, Don- nan is quietly making sure the work of Moche potters survives the vagaries of private collections and individual ownership, where one generation may not value what pre- vious ones cherished. Donnan's position is difficult. To completely ignore artifacts in private hands is to risk their permanent loss. To publish or authenticate them could, however, increase the value of indi- vidual pieces and increase demand. Donnan's years of research, cou- pled with the Sipán discoveries, have paid off. He has cracked the preliterate iconographie "code" of Moche life. There are no glyphs on Moche vessels to tell their story and as far as we know they never prac- ticed writing. Instead, researchers like Donnan look closely at minute stylistic details, costumes, and indi- vidual scenes. Warriors and their activities figure large on the pots. Donnan has recorded processions of warriors carrying clubs and other weapons; men engaged in one-on- one combat in barren desert land- scapes; and prisoners arraigned before an important individual, pri- or to being sacrificed, their blood 58 Archaeology</page><page sequence="3">consumed, and their bodies dis- membered. Donnan believes the Moche went to war to capture vic- tims for an important sacrifice cere- mony that they depicted again and again in their art. He has studied the figures shown attending the cer- emony and identified some of them, most important a Warrior-Priest wearing a crescent-shaped head- dress atop a conical helmet. Don- nan's theory that the sacrifice cere- mony was an integral part of Moche life and not a mythological scene was confirmed by Alva's excavation of a Warrior-Priest, now known as the Lord of Sipán, wear- ing, as Donnan predicted, a conical helmet and crescent-shaped head- dress. Still further excavations at Sipán, and subsequently in the Jequetepeque Valley to the north, revealed the burials of yet more participants in the sacrifice ceremo- ny. All of these individuals corre- spond to figures depicted on Moche vases. These nobles, living in differ- ent parts of the kingdom, enacted the sacrifice ceremony at prescribed times. When they died, they were buried at the place where they had performed the rite, wearing the for- mal regalia and objects they used in the ritual. Their successors assumed their roles, wearing new sets of the same costumes and regalia, perpet- uating the state religion and assur- ing work for the dozens of skilled artisans who manufactured objects for the nobility. When Donnan invited me to visit the exhibition in its temporary home at the Fowler Museum, I leapt at the opportunity. I had heard about the exquisite workmanship of the arti- facts, but nothing prepared me for the darkened galleries resplendent with necklaces of gold and silver peanut beads, golden disks, anthropo- morphized crabs, and golden eye and nose ornaments - to name just a few. Fittingly, the Sipán exhibit starts with line drawings of scenes depict- ed on some of Donnan's pots along- side delicately painted ceramic ves- sels illustrated with warriors and the sacrifice ceremony. The Lords of Sipán ruled over a society with ide- ologies and religious beliefs as pow- erful, and constraining, as those of the ancient Egyptian pharaohs or the rulers of Aztec Tenochtitlan. One then enters galleries overflow- ing with gold and silver artifacts. Wall displays show the grave goods, flattened and corroded, as Alva uncovered them. One marvels at the patience of the Peruvian and German conservators who labored for months on the tiny ornaments and necklaces. One lord wore exquisitely crafted bracelets made of hundreds of minute beads of turquoise, shell, and gold, strung with copper spacer bars. Alva lifted these intact, using unspun cotton batting and soluble glue, then restored them to their original state. The Peruvians have achieved mira- cles of conservation with the slen- derest of resources, an accomplish- ment for which they deserve our undying gratitude. What manner of men were these lords? How did lesser Moche view them? At thje end of the exhibit one confronts designer David Mayo's masterpiece - a model of the Lord of Sipán staring serenely into the distance, caparisoned in a long tunic covered with square platelets of gilded copper, with copper cones at the fringe. He wears a belt with crescent-shaped bells and a war- rior's golden backflap. A large cres- cent-shaped headdress looms high from the woven conical hat on his head. The lord carries a gold and silver scepter in his right hand. The model moves from right to left, the gold and copper shimmering bril- liantly in the overhead lights. Sadly, to judge by the artifacts that have appeared on the art mar- ket in recent years, many Moche tombs have been lost. But on this occasion the Warrior-Priests have tri- umphed. Buried for more than 1,500 years in the dessicated mounds of Sipán, the Lords and their treasures came to light through a rigorous process of scientific excavation. One can only hope the message they bring will not be lost on those who consider the past a gold mine, not our collective cultural heritage. ■ May/June 1994 59</page></plain_text>
