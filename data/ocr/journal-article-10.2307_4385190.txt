SHE WAS born in 1892 in Rockland, Maine, to an affable, hapless man and a virago who soon scuttled him. Childhood was a full library and an empty larder; from the former she learned to think of her life as a legend, from the latter she got the will to make it so. At five she read the word "paramour" and fell into a swoon. At twelve she walked calmly out of school when her principal, driv- en finally mad by this wisp of a girl who insisted on being called "Vincent," hurled a book at her and shouted that she'd run the school long enough. She was named for a hospital, not a saint. "Renascence" made her famous, a long poem written when she was nine- teen. It was a different time, when not only individual books of poetry were reviewed in daily papers but sometimes individual poems; when some of the best critical minds of the country could become apoplectic over the announce- ment of a national poetry contest. She didn't win the contest in question, as it happened, but the clamor that ensued brought her more attention than if she had. The age had found a voice for its immediate, sensual energies, and Millay, after a flurry of letters and a few judiciously included photographs, was launched. In some fundamental sense she never looked back. When her fame threat- ened to estrange her from her mother and sisters, she simply lifted them out of their existence into hers. When any infatuation threatened to define her, she slipped free, always with her love for the idea of experience intact. Pure, virginal, childlike-these are the words her contemporaries used over and over for her, even as she cut a wide and very public swath through libertine Green- wich Village. She learned what her country was learning, to wield an inno- cence without compromising it, to remain as elusive to herself as she was to the people who fell for her. And fall for her they did. Poets and publishers, barkeeps and diplomats, men, women, and amalgamations thereof all fell under Millay's spell, often at the same time. There is a decade and a half during which any biographer who tries to keep track of Millay's affairs begins to sound like the announcer at a horserace. Never, though, is there any question about who was holding the reins: I, being born a woman and distressed By all the needs and notions of my kind, Am urged by your propinquity to find Your person fair, and feel a certain zest To bear your body's weight upon my breast: So subtly is the fume of life designed, To clarify the pulse and cloud the mind, And leave me once again undone, pos- sessed. Think not for this, however, the poor trea- son Of my stout blood against my staggering brain, I shall remember you with love, or season My scorn with pity,-let me make it plain: I find this frenzy insufficient reason For conversation when we meet again. Everyone loved it. Edmund Wilson, who would become the most powerful critic of the time, and whose brief affair with Millay would be the high point of his own hearty erotic life, believed Millay to be great in the old-fashioned, heroic sense of that word. Thomas Hardy thought America's two signifi- cant contributions to world culture were recessional buildings (by which he meant skyscrapers, good old Hardy) and the poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay. Even the lovers whose lives she mined for material remained mostly devoted to her, or at least in a sort of lobotomized awe. Most of all, though, the public loved Millay. Her books sold thousands of copies within the first few weeks of printing. At the height of the Depression she was bringing in the con- temporary equivalent of three hundred thousand dollars a year from her poetry. There were weekly national radio broadcasts. There were reading tours in which she didn't so much appear as emanate, a swirl of velvet gowns and flowing capes, at once ethe- real and sensual, imperious and vulner- able. Partly her audience loved this presence, and partly they loved the poems. Mostly, though, they loved the way one revealed the other, each poem a pane through which to look at a life. Millay ignored the Modernists, who returned the favor, but in one way she leapt beyond them. She was confession- al before there was such a thing. In its essence, it wasn't a pose. The casual sexual rapacity, the constant travel and activity, the alcohol in vol- umes that would have bleared a bull elephant -this was costing her, physi- cally as well as mentally, more than she admitted, either to others or herself. But however lightly all those thousands of readers quoted her most famous epi- gram about the candle burning at both ends, Millay truly meant it. She lived in a kind of continuous present, and there is something both admirable and terri- ble in the extent to which she wedded her art to immediate experience; admirable because she sustained it, ter- rible because to do so required being blind to the wreckage. In her thirties Millay married Eugene Jan Boissevain, partly, one suspects, out of pure fatigue. Not that Boissevain wasn't an interesting man. Dutch, monied, Hollywood handsome, he was a bon vivant with a taste for difficulty, the sort of man who would dive into the Seine in evening clothes to save a stranger from suicide, who deliberately addicted himself to morphine for the sole purpose of giving his love an example of quitting. Lacking in himself the singular passion that defines a life, Boissevain had the wherewithal to attach himself to people who did (his first wife was Inez Milholland, a leader of the women's suffrage movement), as well as the strength and complexity of character to remain utterly himself in their shadows. His devotion to Millay was absolute, and for the rest of his life he took care of all her needs to the extent that any one man could. There's little left to tell-little, that is, that will make this person any more apparent. There was a Pulitzer Prize, which she was the first woman to win. There was George Dillon, the twenty- one-year-old golden boy of poetry with whom Millay absconded to Paris for a time. There was morphine, Millay's last great passion, which she went at with the same ravening intensity with which she'd gone at all the rest. These and a thousand other facts she will not inhab- it now. Millay tumbled down the stairs one night in 1950, legendary to the last. "I have been ecstatic," she left behind in her journal, "but I have not been happy." 2. Millay's reputation as a poet was in decline by the time of her death. Her books have stayed in print, but it wouldn't be inaccurate to say that her poetry has had no discernible influence on twentieth-century poets. (Confes- sionalism would have happened with- out her.) The reasons for this are fairly obvious, and they have little to do with resentment of her fame, or her conser- vative sense of form, or even the moral- ly admirable, aesthetically awful politi- cal poems she wrote at the end of her career. If Millay ascended in part for extra-literary reasons-her beauty, the way she seemed to embody a zeitgeist, her professional cunning-she sank for purely literary ones. In everyday life the evolution of lan- guage is an incremental (or decremen- tal), hardly definable sort of thing. In literature there are definite rifts. Any poetry that gets caught on the wrong side of a seismic shift is likely going to sink, at least for a while. The literary language Millay was born into may not have been completely rotten, but it was very ripe. Except for a couple of instances, she seems never to have investigated or needed a more flexible idiom. As late as 1930 she could begin a poem, "Gone in good sooth you are." She had a splendid ear for pre-existing poetic cadence (Shakespeare's and Tennyson's, primarily), and almost none for the language in the air around her. It is as if a master chef locked her- self in a house filled from floor to ceil- ing with half-blackened bananas. Nothing to do but make pudding-lots and lots of pudding. It's taken a while, then, to discover what is worth saving in Millay, to hear the poetry amid all the pretty writing. She had a talent for astringent, memo- rable epigrams. At a time when most epigrams tended toward the gnomic or the coy-"April is the cruelest month," "Rationalists should wear sombreros," that sort of thing-Millay wrote many old-fashioned detachable maxims, if not exactly the sort you'd want to stitch on a sampler: Who builds her a house with love for tim- ber Builds her a house of foam. And I'd liefer be bride to a lad gone down Than widow to one safe home. (from "Keen") That which has quelled me, lives with me, Accomplice in catastrophe. (from "Theme and Variations") Indeed, Millay's entire imagination was in a sense epigrammatic, in that she was constantly reducing, in both the positive and negative senses of that word, complicated experience into beautiful truths. It's strange that a mind so devoted to the intensity of experi- ence could be so confident of formulat- ing it, that a person so devoted to the body could, as a poet, be so consistent- ly abstract. This tension is the most salient feature of her style. Millay is all ear, no eye. "I am way- laid by Beauty," she writes in one poem, and she invariably was. There is not a single instance in Millay of the sort of head-clearing metaphorical orig- inality that R. P. Blackmur once said "added to the stock of available reali- ty," and which marks certain periods more than others. (The Modernists and the Renaissance poets have it, for instance; the Victorians and the Augustans mostly don't.) Millay's method, like Tennyson's, is to employ a limited set of images in emblematic, usually anthropomorphic ways. She doesn't see the world, she sings it: Thus in the winter stands the lonely tree, Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one, Yet knows its boughs more silent than before: I cannot say what loves have come and gone, I only know that summer sang in me A little while, that in me sings no more. It's worth noting how "recollected in tranquility" this is. For all the emphasis on impulse and immediacy in Millay, for all the poems in praise of Dionysus (she once enclosed twenty-seven new sonnets with a love letter), Millay's best poems, finally, occur not in the grasp of passion but in its wake. In love she is usually pure honey, in lust pure gall. Neither is quite real. The latter is bet- ter, though usually, as in the sonnet I 10 THE THREEPENNY REVIEW</page><page sequence="2">quoted in the first part of this essay, it seems a somewhat glib inversion of sen- timentality. Somewhere in between the two, though, when the ecstasy of an occasion subsides to the baffled absence of a form, or when the abstract lan- guage of her passion resolves into something that is not quite nostalgia, not quite indifference, and not quite love, Millay comes alive. She is even, at times, specific: She had forgotten how the August night Was level as a lake beneath the moon, In which she swam a little, losing sight Of shore; and how the boy, who was at noon Simple enough, not different from the rest, Wore now a pleasant mystery as he went, Which seemed to her an honest enough test Whether she loved him, and she was con- tent. So loud, so loud the million crickets' choir... So sweet the night, so long-drawn-out and late... And if the man were not her spirit's mate, Why was her body sluggish with desire? Stark on the open field the moonlight fell, But the oak tree's shadow was deep and black and secret as a well. This is from "Sonnets to an Ungraft- ed Tree," a series of poems written in the voice of a woman who finds herself taking care of a dying man she's never truly loved, though it seems she's spent most of her life with him. There's more density of experience in these poems than anywhere else in Millay. Gone is the tendency to stamp an epigram, gone the obvious biographical context (one that I can find, at any rate: neither of her most recent biographers even mentions this sequence). The language is still merely gestural in places ("mys- tery," "sweet," "secret") and there's that familiar trope of losing sight of shore, but this, again, is simply how a Millay poem works. She takes the bluntest materials and occasionally makes some cut sharper than you could have expected, uses stock poetic images and ideas and somehow renders some truth of feeling as stark and unplumbable as this poem's closing image. Randall Jarrell once famously defined a good poet as someone who, in a life- time of standing out in thunderstorms, managed to get struck by lightning five or six times; double that and you were great (though, presumably, charred). The truth is, though, that Millay wrote some twenty poems well worth remem- bering but no single poem with suffi- cient complexity, or singularity of voice, or reach, or sometbing to be great. She loved her limitations too much to ever transcend them, but loved them with enough discipline to make them durable. She was overrated by her own time but is underrated now. Her work warrants a revival, though she could have used an editor with less of a sweet tooth. This new Modern Library edition ought to come with a shot of ins,ulin. 3. Any poet lives two lives. There's the life of dates and places, ambitions and degeneracies, money and love and the lack thereof-the life, in short, that everyone leads. Inside of this or raveled up with this is the life of artistic con- sciousness, which, no matter how directly it may seem to derive from events and actions, bides its own time, and bears its own pains, and either acquires and sustains some existence independent of that biological life to which it's tied, or dies with it. Biographers and critics rarely get at the latter. Walter Jackson Bate does it for Keats, Peter Makin for Bunting, Richard Poirier for Frost. What I am talking about is something more than merely focusing on the work in equal proportion to the life or scrupulously setting one in relation to the other. It involves some understanding that the engagement between a poet and the books she reads is something more inti- mate than "influence," the link between life and language not reducible to "subject matter." Most lasting art is made by people who believe with everything in them that art is for the sake of life, but who live otherwise. When a life is particularly furious or frivolous, though, when its dimensions seem greater than the work that emerges out of it, this can be a hard thing to keep in mind. Nancy Milford doesn't even try. Savage Beauty is less about a poet than a phenomenon, less a work of criticism than enthusiasm, less a book than a magazine profile run amok. Maybe, just maybe, given the very particular way that Millay linked her poetry with her sexuality, there's some case to be made for including intimate physical descriptions. But to have her bounding into a room having just discovered her clitoris, to breathlessly imagine her lovers ("His lips were so soft, it was like kissing the flesh of a girl's nipple"), to give us even the color and sparseness of her pubic hair-this, finally, is not to take either your subject or your readers very seriously. To be sure, Milford loves Millay, has been completely con- sumed by her for the past thirty years. This, to put it gently, is the problem: "By now I had an inkling of the furies that drove the Millays, and I was wary of their enchantment. I didn't know then the strength of that pull on women, or that one cannot be wary enough." Daniel Mark Epstein's book, What Lips These Lips Have Kissed: The Loves and Love Poems of Edna St. Vincent Millay, is more focused, more intelligent, and more discreet, though there are certainly enough passages to suggest that the "pull" Milford felt isn't as gender specific as she thought. (Here is Millay just before she charges George Dillon: "4She gazed at the youth, her eyelids lowering slightly, her nostrils flared.") Epstein is interested exclusive- ly in Millay the love poet, the poems written at the quick of the senses, and he's good at distinguishing her heat-of- the-moment style from poets whose pri- mary force is loss, as well as describing the course she negotiated between physical inspiration and what he calls "emotional entropy." I wish this book were more informed and pressured by Epstein's own engagement with poetry (he is himself a gifted poet), that he didn't slide so easily off the work into the life. But that, perhaps, is to ask for a more interior, less determinedly com- mercial book than he ever intended to write. In any event, neither of these writers comes close to giving a sense of the consciousness that created Millay's poems. I can't think of many poets as difficult to get at in this regard. Millay confesses everything and reveals noth- ing. She wrote no critical prose that might cast the poems in a different light, and the poems themselves, like her persona, don't articulate an inner life so much as fend it off. It wouldn't be accurate to say that she developed a pose along the lines of late Frost, for Millay was this welter of impulse and instinct and averted consciousness from first to last. "To change your language you must change your life," Derek Walcott has written. Millay never changed either. Whatever stillness there is inside all this surface turbulence, whatever life inside the legend, she won't disclose them easily. She is in there, though, somewhere. The fact is, it takes a good deal of intel- ligence to write a real poem, however deliberately obscured or erratically applied that intelligence may be in a life. It also requires some latent, coher- ent sense of self (even if a poem is, as Eliot thought, a means of escaping this), though that self as it is revealed outside the work may be too fragment- ed and too fugitive to find by way of conventional biography. Reading through these recent books on Millay, I had to continually return to the poems to remind myself of these things. There is a silence at the center of Millay, both the woman and the poet, one which at rare moments she seems to have been aware of, and which she's still waiting for someone to hear: "Nobody speaks to me. People fall in love with me, and annoy me and distress me and flatter me and excite me and-and all that sort of thing. But no one speaks to me. I sometimes think that no one can."
