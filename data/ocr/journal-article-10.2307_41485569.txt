<plain_text><page sequence="1">STYLE, SPACE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION: An Archaeological Investigation of Rock Art in Inland North Queensland, Australia Victoria Wade1, Lynley A. Wallis2'1 and Woolgar Valley Aboriginal Corporation3 Abstract The rock art of the north Queensland highlands has previously been argued to be the northern limit of the Central Queensland Province, based on a similarity of techniques and motifs. In this paper we test this hypothesis through an archaeological study of the rock art of Middle Park Station in the Gregory Range. Motifs from 88 rock art sites were analysed, revealing a predominance of stencilling of a limited range of motifs, with rare paintings of mostly geometric motifs and similarly rare occurrences of geometric motifs executed in a variety of engraving techniques. We argue these results, coupled with other considerations of distance and biogeography, suggest the north Queensland highlands should be regarded as a distinct rock art province, separate from the Central Queensland Province. Evidence is also presented to suggest that open social networks with limited territoriality were operating in the study area through at least the late Holocene. Introduction In Queensland several distinct art 'provinces' have been identified (Morwood 2002; see Figure 1) and arguments have been presented as to what the various provincial styles might reveal about territorial boundaries, intergroup interaction and changing social networks through time (e.g. David and Lourandos 1998; Franklin 2004; Morwood 1979). For example, in Cape York Peninsula, rock art of the late Holocene is highly regionalised with territorial boundaries argued to be identifiable through spatial stylistic variability (see David and Chant 1995). This has been interpreted as suggesting that closed social networks operated regionally, as high resource availability in this fertile region meant that strong social relationships with neighbouring groups were not critical for survival (David and Cole 1990:802-804). The study reported here characterises the rock art of Middle Park Station in the Gregory Range in order to explore past patterns of regional social organisation. Until this study, the north Queensland highlands had been subjected to a comparatively small amount of archaeological research (e.g. Gorecki et al 1992, 1996; Morwood 1990, 1992; Smith and Rowland 1991; Walsh 1985). Though limited in extent and rarely focused on rock art, such studies led to the area being described as an extension of the Central Queensland Province whose core is some 2000km to the south (Gorecki et al 1996:223; Morwood and Godwin 1982:51; Quinnell 1976:242). 1 Department of Archaeology, Flinders University, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia vic.wade87@gmail.com 2 Aboriginal Environments Research Centre, School of Architecture, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD 4072, Australia lynley. wallis@uq.edu.au 3 C/-11 Harris Street, Richmond, QLD 4822, Australia Figure 1 Queensland showing the location of places mentioned in the text and rock art provinces after Morwood (2002). The Middle Park Station Study Area Middle Park Station is a pastoral property located 120km north of the small township of Richmond in the semi-arid sclerophyllous tropics (Figure 1). The more northerly part of the property is dominated by the Gregory Range, characterised by broken sandstone tablelands dissected by the Norman River (Figure 2). In contrast, the more southerly and westerly parts of the station belong to the Strathpark Land System (Perry et al 1964), a low- lying plain with restricted opportunities for rock art production; here the Woolgar River is the main water source. Vegetation is predominantly sparse to moderately dense woodland, with a grass understorey. It is home to a wide variety of native animals that would have been hunted by the local Aboriginal population (Wright 1988). Introduced species, which have developed sizable feral populations, include pigs, cats, goats, rabbits and cane toads, while cattle are also grazed on the station; some of these represent challenges for effective cultural heritage management. The broader region was opened up for pastoral development in the early 1860s and in the following decade gold was discovered along the upper Woolgar River, resulting in a dramatic influx of miners and increasing levels of conflict between Indigenous people and settlers (Litster and Wallis in press; Loos 1993; Morwood 1990). The 1881 fatal spearing of Number 72, June 201 1 aUStralian ARCHAEOLOGY 23</page><page sequence="2">Style, Space and Social Interaction Figure 2 Middle Park Station, showing survey areas and distribution of recorded archaeological sites. a white Native Mounted Police Sub-Inspector on the goldfield prompted the 'dispersal' of Indigenous groups in the Middle Park area; only a few people survived these massacres (Wallis et al 2005). Such events, together with the effects of disease, alcohol, opium and dislocation, are argued to have halved regional population numbers during the mid-to-late 1800s (Wright 1988:8), resulting in changes to aspects of culture including rock art production, territorial boundaries and social organisation. Historical descriptions of which group occupied Middle Park are inconsistent (e.g. MacGillivray 1886; Roth 1897; Tindale 1974), though the southern portion lies within the contemporary Native Title claim of the Ngawun Mbara people, while the northern part of the property is outside any current claim. Systematic research on Middle Park began in 2002 through a collaborative partnership between Wallis and the Woolgar Valley Aboriginal Corporation (WVAC), resulting in the documentation of hundreds of sites, dominated in the sandstone country by rockshelters containing stencilled art (Wallis et al 2004). To date, four such rockshelters have been excavated, allowing a preliminary occupation sequence to be established. Two of the excavated rockshelters (MP76 and MP83) date to the mid-Holocene (4820±70 BP and 22801220 BP respectively), while another (MP 102) is dated to the late Pleistocene (14,080±210 BP) (Wallis et al 2004:47). Recent excavations at Gledswood Shelter 1 have yielded a non-basal age of 28, 4191320 BP (Wk-24199), thus indicating activity in the area before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (Wallis et al 2009). Although detailed analyses are yet to be carried out, initial evidence indicates probable abandonment or minimal use through the LGM, with major shifts in land-use strategies during the mid-Holocene (cf. Morwood 1992). Methods and Limitations Owing to the rugged terrain, coupled with the WVAC desire to record as many sites as possible, pedestrian survey targeted four areas of sandstone outcrops in close proximity to water and which were relatively accessible via existing station tracks (Figure 2). A hand-held GPS was used to record site locations and all sites were photographed and sketched. Attributes documented for each site included: • Shelter dimensions (length, height and depth to drip-line); • Shelter orientation; • Presence and type of non-art archaeological remains; • Rock art production techniques present (stencilling, engraving [abraded or pecked], painting or a combination thereof); • Motif types present (categorised as either adult hand, child hand, hand variation, boomerang, hand-plus-forearm, human foot, spear thrower, stone axe, digging stick, spearhead, shield, animal feature, circle, goanna); • Numbers of each motif type present; • Pigment colour (red, orange, red-purple, red-brown, red- orange, white, grey, black, yellow or purple); • Composition presence; and • General site and art condition, including evidence for animal activity, such as sleeping hollows and mud wasp, termite or bird nests. Hand stencils were noted, where possible, as being of left or right hands (assuming that during their production the artist placed their palm flat against the rock surface) and whether they included any Variations' (e.g. missing digits). Measurements were recorded for hand and boomerang stencils present at a small random sample of sites, and the latter assigned to one of two categories - hunting/fighting or toy/comeback - based primarily on their size and ethnographic descriptions (Roth 1897:142-146, 1909:202-203; see Figure 3). Boomerangs of the toy/comeback type were typically significantly smaller than the hunting type, with the bend centrally located, while hunting/ fighting boomerangs were more variable in shape, with a typically off-centre bend indicating obvious distal and proximal portions. It is recognised that measurements of hand stencils are inevitably crude and that they provide only a general age- range of the stencil producer, however, they often allow distinctions between adult and children's hands to be drawn (Gunn 2006: 110; McDonald 1995). Although studies have attempted to discern gender from hand stencils (e.g. Damhuis 2005), most have concluded that typically this cannot be ascribed (Flood 1987:104; Henneberg and Mathers 1994) and thus such interpretation was not attempted in this study. Circles were recorded as either 'simple' (comprising solely an outline) or 'complex' (those with some form of infill). For the purpose of clarifying the nature of deteriorated motifs, basic digital enhancement of photographs using Adobe Photoshop was utilised (cf. Brady 2006, 2007). This involved adjusting the brightness and contrast of the images and then using the Colour Range Select tool to isolate faded pigment colours from the rock surface. The Middle Park rock art was analysed in a manner similar to that used for any other category of material culture. Thus an archaeological approach was adopted, taking into account 24 australian ARCHAEOLOGY Number 72, June 201 1</page><page sequence="3">Victoria Wade, Lynley A. Wallis and Woolgar Valley Aboriginal Corporation the art's physical context, and focusing on distributional and statistical analyses of techniques and motifs. Technique frequencies, motif type frequencies, frequency of association with other archaeological remains, left- versus right-hand stencil numbers, pigment colours and rock art assemblage size (i.e. the number of stencilled motifs in each shelter) were examined to enable a general characterisation of the assemblage to be made. ArcGIS software was used to conduct basic spatial analyses (such as plotting the locations of all sites containing paintings, engravings, hand variations, material culture and children's hands) in order to identify clustering or patterns. The relationship between assemblage size and location was also investigated, as was the distribution of pigment colours. Unlike portable material culture items that can be exchanged and traded, rock art is unique in its immovability, being fixed in its intended location by its producer(s) (Chippindale and Nash 2004). Mapping its physical distribution thus enables the examination of issues of territorial boundaries and social interactions among neighbouring groups (e.g. Domingo Sanz et al 2008; McDonald 2008; Ross 2003). In order to address such issues using a spatial- stylistic approach, comparisons were made between the rock art styles of Middle Park and those in adjacent provinces. The results of these comparative analyses are combined with spatial data, at both local and state-wide levels, to develop an understanding of how the rock art reflects social behaviour across the landscape. Preservation is a major limitation in any study of the spatial distribution of rock art (Chippindale and Nash 2004:9; Morwood 1979:293), and this certainly affects the current study. In considering site distribution, we acknowledge that what survives is but a sample of the original assemblage. Differential rates of deterioration result from several factors, including pigment type (and presumably preparation), site type, engraving depth, rock surface and exposure to the elements (Bednarik 1994), meaning that rock art survival is not consistent across space, time or contexts. However, all archaeological site types are similarly subject to taphonomic processes which influence perceptions regarding their distribution and composition. Results: Characterising the Rock Art Assemblage A total of 88 rock art sites was recorded on Middle Park. Stencilled art is found in all art sites, while engraved and painted motifs are found in only 6.8% (n=6) and 3.4% (n=3) of art sites, respectively. Stencilled Art In the 88 sites, 1348 stencilled motifs were recorded, with the majority comprising hand stencils, including adult, child, variation and hand-plus-forearm types (94%; n=1274). Where the handedness of stencils could be determined, the majority were left adult hands (61%; n=417). Other stencils recorded, in decreasing order of occurrence, include indeterminate, boomerangs, animal-related motifs (e.g. dingo paws, bird feet, snake), human feet, spear throwers, stone axes, digging sticks, spearheads and shields (see Table 1). Nineteen hand variation stencils of seven types were recorded in seven different sites. These were examined using pigment splatter analysis, in order to determine whether they had been created by bending over digits or as a result of actual Figure 3 Schematic diagram showing measurements taken on hand and boomerang stencils. amputation (see Walsh 1979). Twelve of the 19 variation stencils are of the 'crooked finger' type (see Figure 4), which were clearly created by manipulating the hand position; these are omitted from the following discussion. In two of the remaining seven motifs it appears that fingers were deliberately bent over during production, on the basis of the presence of underspray which suggests the hand was not positioned flat against the rock wall during stencilling. Digital amputation is suggested to have been present in three other motifs based on the lack of underspray and clear outlines of the hands, including areas of the missing fingers, which indicates that the whole hand was pressed against the rock during production. All three of these motifs represent the absence of the little finger. It is known ethnographically that amputation of this digit was common among women in many coastal Queensland regions, and was also practised amongst the Kalkadoon women of Mt Isa (Roth 1910:42-43). The remaining two variation motifs were too deteriorated to determine if they represented genuine amputations or bent digits. Nineteen boomerangs were recorded, falling into eight major forms (Figure 5) including ones used for fighting/hunting, as well as toy boomerangs (Roth 1897:142-146, 1909:202-203). Two spear throwers were identified, as were two hafted stone axes, one shield and one digging stick/club. No objects of European origin were identified in the stencilled art. The most common pigment colour used for stencilling is red, which occurs in 78% of sites, followed by orange and red- purple in 57% and 49% of sites, respectively (see Table 2). Also present, although in considerably fewer sites, are red- orange, Number 72, June 201 1 aUStralian ARCHAEOLOGY 25</page><page sequence="4">Style, Space and Social Interaction Figure 4.

Wallis and Woolgar Valley Aboriginal Corporation yellow, red-brown, purple, white, grey and black pigments. The white pigment used was almost certainly pipeclay and the black is assumed to be charcoal-based. No ochre quarries were located during surveys of Middle Park, although considerable quantities of ochre have been recovered from the Gledswood Shelter 1 excavations (Wallis et al 2009). Engraved Art Engravings are comparatively rare, with just 86 such motifs occurring in six rockshelters; no open engraving sites were found despite an abundance of suitable surfaces. Two different engraving techniques are present, with pecking occurring in all six sites, and abrasion in one. Peckings were created by removing only the topmost layer of the rock surface, resulting in almost 'white' images with very little depth to them, sometimes resembling the effects of natural surface exfoliation but for the particular form taken. Regardless of technique used, the overwhelming majority of engravings are circular motifs, comprising 94% (n=81) of the total. Some of these circles include interior cross-hatching, though the majority are simple outlines. A single figurative motif has been recorded: a possible lizard in MP 107 (Figure 6). Additionally, at MP84 a deteriorated pecked image has been tentatively classified as an anthropomorph, as the figure appears to have a recognisable 'head' and 'arms', although owing to erosion the 'legs' are no longer visible (Figure 7). Paintings/Positive Hand Prints Paintings represent the smallest category of art styles at Middle Park and are present in only three sites. One site contains two red-purple positive hand prints while another contains three simple outlined circles (one white and two red-purple). The third site contains several unusual motifs, including a yellow vertical stripe painted down the centre of a stencilled shield (Figure 8), two large red geometric shapes, one yellow positive hand print, a cluster of yellow solid infilled circles and a single orange solid infilled circle. Assemblage Size , Compositions and Locations Sixty one percent of the rock art sites on Middle Park contain fewer than 10 stencils, while 85% contain fewer than 30; sites with more than 30 motifs are rare (15%; see Figure 9).

Figure 10 Map showing the distribution of boomerang stencils in the surveyed areas on Middle Park Station. (-2%) contain more than 150 stencils, the richest containing 176 (MP 130). It may be noteworthy that MP 130 is the most easterly site recorded along the Norman River, and it is therefore possible that even larger rock art assemblages might occur further upstream as one moves further into the heart of the range; this area could be not be surveyed because of a lack of vehicle access and logistical difficulties. Occasional compositions are present, most commonly comprising arrangements of stencilled adult hands including rows, pairs, hand variations, and hands with decorative pecked infill. Material culture stencils also appear in compositions, such as boomerangs depicted touching back- to-back (MP83). At MP84 a hand stencil has been depicted inside a stencilled shield (Figure 8), and three hands are positioned over the top of a boomerang with pecked infill. Three examples of stencils with decorative pecked infill were recorded, including linear designs inside a shield and boomerang, and pecked dots inside hand stencils. Art occurs most commonly in south-oriented shelters (40 of the 72 sites for which this variable was recorded). While 30% (n=26) of sites containing rock art have no other evidence for cultural activity, the remainder do, principally in the form of grinding surfaces which occur in c.50% (n=43) of art sites. Surface stone artefacts occur in 48% (n=42) of sites, and 22% (n=19) have axe grinding grooves. Figure 2 shows the location of recorded sites across Middle Park. GIS analysis revealed very few statistically significant clusters or patterns, though depictions of boomerangs are more common in the eastern section of Survey Area 3 (see Figure 10). Here there is a cluster of sites near the junction of a major creek feeding into the Norman River known as 'Black Springs'. In summary, the Middle Park rock art assemblage is dominated by stencilled adult hands and other motifs, infrequently occurring pecked and abraded geometric motifs, and a small number of painted images. Sites typically contain fewer than 30 motifs, although two were recorded with more than 150 stencils. Most sites face south, and shelters range in size from very small (2m) to very large (40m) in length. Grinding surfaces and stone artefacts are commonly associated with rock art, although sediment accumulation in almost all rockshelters is absent and hence excavation potential is typically low. In the discussion to follow we compare the data presented above with surrounding rock art provinces to explore broader themes of régionalisation, territoriality and intergroup interaction. Comparison with Surrounding Provinces The sample of rock art on Middle Park examined so far does not generally demonstrate any internal spatial patterning across the landscape. Rather, it comprises a relatively homogenous art body without internal stylistic boundaries or motif clusters that might indicate territorial confines or areas of overlap. This may be due to limitations of the relatively small size of the study area, however, it is more likely to be the result of the surveyed areas belonging to a single cultural group. While a cluster of unusual motifs, rare techniques and large sites was identified around the confluence with Black Springs, the motivation for intensive activity in this specific area cannot be easily interpreted. To assess how social interaction, ideas exchange and cultural influence between groups might be reflected in art, Middle Park must be considered in the context of the broader region. The stylistically diverse rock art of the limestone-dominated southeast Cape York Peninsula Province (CYPP) has been intensively studied (e.g. Cole 1988, 1995, 2006; Cole and David 1992; Cole et al 1995; David 1987, 1991; David and Cole 1990; David and Lourandos 1998; Flood 1987; Morwood 1989a, 1995; Rosenfeld 1982; Rosenfeld et al 1981; Trezise 1969, 1971; Watchman and Cole 1993). Three central themes dominate the literature on this province: régionalisation, chronology, and the link between the two. Based on absolute dating at sites including Early Man Rocksheiter and Possum Rocksheiter, it has been proposed that a widespread, homogeneous engraving tradition existed in CYPP prior to the development of the elaborate, regionally diverse painted method (including colourful anthropomorphic Quinkan figures) for which the area is best-known today (Cole and Watchman 2005; Rosenfeld et al 1981). This stylistic evolution has been the subject of much consideration, with the focus often being on how it is associated with other changes apparent in the mid-Holocene archaeological record (e.g. David and Cole 1990; David and Lourandos 28 australian ARCHAEOLOGY Number 72, June 201 1</page><page sequence="7">Victoria Wade, Lynley A. Wallis and Woolgar Valley Aboriginal Corporation 1998; Morwood 1989a). As such, CYPP's rock art has been interpreted as widely indicating shifts in settlement patterns and interaction networks. The rock art of Middle Park and that of CYPP differ greatly, with the primary disparity being the presence of highly stylised painted figurative art in CYPP, which is entirely lacking in the Middle Park repertoire. A greater range of stencilled and engraved motifs is also present in CYPP, with Middle Park lacking contact art and other unusual stencilled motifs such as 'dolls' or 'human heads and shoulders'. We argue that this divergence suggests CYPP groups had little contact with those in the Middle Park area, a phenomenon which may be attributable to the closed social networks operating in the fertile CYPP (David and Cole 1990:802-803; see Lewis 1988 for similar arguments about Arnhem Land). Such environments allow larger populations to be accommodated, therefore increasing competition for resources, and subsequently necessitating stylistic variability in order to reinforce territorial boundaries. To the west of Middle Park is the Mt Isa Province (MIP), an area not as well-studied as CYPP, but known to contain vast engraved assemblages and painted panels with rare stencils (Franklin 1996, 2004; Morwood 1979, 1985; Ridges 2003; Ross 1997). Here Ridges et al. (2000) have directly dated charcoal from a single painted motif, obtaining an age estimate of c.870 BP. Visual analyses of differential weathering and patination led Morwood et al. (1978) to suggest a substantial age for the engravings. The art of the MIP most resembles engraving-dominated assemblages to the north at Chillagoe and in the central desert (Edwards 1966; Franklin 2004), owing to the predominance of pecked circles; this latter similarity is unsurprising given the proximity of the arid zone and the familial relationships between groups in the MIP and those of the desert. Although pecked circles do occur at Middle Park, including complex types common to the MIP, they are rare, present in &lt;6% of sites. Conversely, stencils are generally rare in the MIP. This stark technical contrast suggests that people in the Middle Park and Mt Isa areas did not exchange ideas regarding rock art, perhaps indicating a lack of social ties between them, or chose not to incorporate the styles of the respective group into their own artistic traditions; ethnographic evidence pertaining to this is discussed below. The Central Queensland Province (CQP) has been argued to extend from the central Queensland highlands some 2000km north to Croydon (Morwood 1984:361), thus encompassing Middle Park and Esmeralda Stations (the latter investigated by Gorecki et al. 1996). While there was some early interest in CQP rock art (e.g. McCarthy 1960; Mulvaney and Joyce 1965), Quinnell's (1976, 1977) and Morwood's (1976, 1978, 1979, 1982, 1984, 1989b, 1992, 2002:204-230) more recent studies are the most authoritative. Largely descriptive and focused on style and technique, discussions of CQP regional diversity and chronology have not been as extensive as those in CYPP (cf. Morwood 1992). Generally, the rock art of CQP sandstone rockshelters is characterised by stencilled motifs, including hands, hand variations and items of material culture, with engravings also common. Paintings, prints and drawings are known to occur as well, although less frequently. Taking into account absolute dating, spatial, technical, superimposition and differential weathering information, Morwood (1984:363- 365) suggested there had been three phases of art production in the CQP. The earliest phase (Phase 1) comprises pecked engravings including tracks, circles, pits, arcs and connecting lines, and was at least 9000 years old, possibly more (Morwood 1992). Phase 2 is characterised by the appearance of stencils, paintings, drawings and prints, along with a change in engraving techniques, such as the emergence of abraded and pecked-then-abraded methods, and the appearance of the distinctive 'vulva' motif. The more regional character of the rock art of this phase is also noted. Phase 2 is thought to commence c.4200 years ago based on excavated pigment fragments, although no actual motifs have been directly dated as yet. Phase 3 is the contact period, during which Phase 2 techniques continue along with an increased use of white pigment and contact motifs. Border (1992) carried out research into rock art sites in the central Mitchell Grass Downs area to the north of the CQP and south of Middle Park. Though based on limited data, all rock art sites were located in areas of exposed sandstone near water sources and were dominated by non-figurative paintings (usually crosses and sets of lines), engravings (including macropod tracks) and hand stencils. On this basis, Border (1992:13) argued that the Mitchell Grass Downs art showed affinities with the CQP and what was then known of the north Queensland highlands, based primarily on the shared predominance of stencilling. The results of the Middle Park study demonstrate that although superficially comparable in content and style, the range and proportions of motifs are distinctly different from those found in the CQP. The diverse range of motifs depicted using all techniques in the CQP contrasts to the highly restricted range present at Middle Park, where there are low numbers of engravings and paintings which are common to the CQP. It is these fundamental disparities that indicate that the two might be better considered as separate provinces rather than comprising a single artistic cultural bloc. Further, while we recognise there are precedents for cultural style covering large expanses, such as in the Australian arid zone where the same style of engraved motifs spans some 2.5 million km2 (cf. Layton 1992), we do note that there are extensive differences in both the biogeography and language groups between the north Queensland highlands and CQP, quite dissimilar to the situation in the arid zone. We argue that while there may have been some contact between the groups of the north and central Queensland highlands, this was of a limited nature and social ties between the people of these two regions were not critical for survival in times of resource stress. However, within each region respectively, the relative degree of technical and stylistic homogeneity suggests that environmental and social conditions were such that open social networks were required to facilitate access to the resources of neighbouring groups in times of scarcity. In the north Queensland highlands the more limited range of motifs, restricted typically to hands, suggests that a lesser degree of artistic variability was required for territorial delineation than in the CQP, possibly owing to greater unreliability of resources. In light of this, it appears that a broad function of the art of the north Queensland highlands, including that of Middle Park, was to create cohesion among groups, with only minor variations, such as painted stick figures found at Esmeralda (Gorecki et al. 1996), indicating the presence of culturally distinguishable groups. Number 72, June 201 1 aUStralian ARCHAEOLOGY 29</page><page sequence="8">Style, Space and Social Interaction The Relevance of Ethnography While working predominantly to the southwest of Middle Park, the ethnographic reports of Walter Roth provide further insight into the nature of regional social relationships. Roth (1897, 1910) included more than 100 references to trade between regions sometimes over 200km distant, thus enhancing our ability to infer social meaning from rock art, although he rarely mentions rock art or people from Middle Park specifically. Roth noted that trade occurred more or less continuously between different groups throughout the Boulia, Upper Georgina, Leichhardt- Selwyn and Cloncurry districts: comparatively large numbers of people of both sexes may be congregated sometimes at these large markets. Thus it happens that ideas are interchanged, superstitions and traditions handed from district to district, and more or less modified and altered in transit, that new words and terms are picked up, and that corrobborees [sic] are learnt and exchanged, just like any other commodities (Roth 1897:136). This comment highlights the importance of trade, not only for exchanging goods, but also as a means of transferring intangible aspects of culture, potentially including methods of rock art production and styles. Roth (1897:132) also noted that trade routes invariably ran along water courses, many were 'laid down since time immemorial' and they were 'of greater or less extent rigidly adhered to'. As noted above, two major rivers run across Middle Park, the Norman and Woolgar, though their importance was probably overshadowed in terms of human movement by the much larger east-flówing Flinders River located c. 120km south though arguably still within the home range of people occupying Middle Park. Roth (1897:136) indicated that the 'Woonamurra' ( Wanamara) traded fishing nets, woomeras, spears and forehead nets with groups from the Cloncurry district to the east, though it is not stated what they received in return; however, the extensive array of axe grinding grooves on Middle Park Station, and absence of local sources of volcanic raw materials suitable for axe production, suggests a strong likelihood that axe blanks were a desired commodity. Nevertheless, in light of this absence of information, direct intergroup influences on rock art in the Middle Park area are largely unknown. Nonetheless, Roth's ethnographic data do provide support for conclusions regarding social interaction drawn solely from the rock art evidence, including the notion that the Indigenous groups of CYPP did not interact directly with groups further south or west such as those in the Middle Park area. When considered exclusively in terms of style and techniques, the lack of stylistic influence or overlap between the regions indicates the absence of social relationships. This evidence is complemented by the fact that CYPP trade routes are known to have been geographically restricted (Roth 1897). Together with the proposition that Cape York was comprised of closed social networks, the ethnographic evidence potentially explains the lack of stylistic similarity between the CYPP and adjacent provinces. Further, interviews with several non- Indigenous settlers in Chillagoe indicated that Indigenous groups from the area had no significant contact with outsiders (David and Cole 1990:794); two informants independently noted that the Palmer (northern) people were hostile towards the Chillagoe people. This information further supports the notion that groups in CYPP had little or no contact with those beyond the peninsula, with the hostile northern and southern CYPP relationship possibly acting as a barrier. The stark stylistic differences between Middle Park and the Mt Isa region may also be explored from an ethnographic perspective. Pearson (1949:197) and MacGillivray (1886:342) recorded that the Kalkadoon people had a hostile relationship with adjacent, weaker groups, such as the Wanamara, from whom they captured women and stole food. Roth ( 1897: 135) also indicated the Kalkadoon were 'the most savage of the aboriginals [sic] under consideration' and only travelled short distances from their own country. The negative nature of any interaction and the distinctly antagonistic relationship between the Kalkadoon and adjacent groups may have resulted in the maintenance of stylistic dissimilarity for territorial delineation purposes. In the north Queensland highlands, the relatively homogeneous nature of the art has been interpreted above as indicating the presence of open social networks in a harsh environment. Under such circumstances, it is often thought that groups keep population levels below maximum carrying capacity to allow for fluctuating and unreliable resource availability. Support for this interpretation is further provided by MacGillivray (1886:340), who stated that 'when the Whites first entered on the extensive territory of the Oonoomurra [Wanamara] in 1865 the tribe is estimated to have numbered only two hundred souls'. The low population levels observed during the immediate post-contact period (i.e. even before the effects of 'dispersals' were felt) further indicate the probable operation of open social networks, which are in turn reflected in the rock art. Social Contexts of Rock Art, including Gender While this study has used spatial and comparative rock art data to explore intergroup relationships, analysis of site context on a finer scale also has the potential to reveal elements of the social context of the art. Rock art is often thought to have served a spiritual or ceremonial function, although the available evidence suggests that Middle Park rock art was more secular in purpose. The probable presence of women, evidenced by women-specific hand mutilation, digging sticks and infants' hand stencils, supports this notion. In the past, it has been assumed that rock art production was carried out predominately by men (e.g. Crawford 1968:37; Roth 1904; Spencer and Gillen 1899 [ 1968] :614). Such assumptions arose largely through the androcentric nature of early anthropological studies (Smith and O'Donnell 2007:105) in which women's roles and activities often went unrecorded. Also, the long-established link between men and power within Western societies influenced the perceived ability of women to create spiritual rock paintings, and such notions were either not considered or ignored (Smith and O'Donnell 2007:105). Since the emergence of feminist theory, several investigations have revealed that women were indeed likely to have been involved in rock art production (e.g. McDonald 1992, 1995; Smith 1991). The context of women's hand stencils at Middle Park, always placed alongside those probably created by men or children, suggests that the art did not have a restricted audience, and thus was more likely to have served an open social context. Following this argument, the rock art assemblage is ideal for demonstrating local group identifying behaviour (following 30 australian ARCHAEOLOGY Number 72, June 2011</page><page sequence="9">Victoria Wade, Lynley A. Wallis and Woolgar Valley Aboriginal Corporation McDonald 2008), further reinforcing the notion that the stylistic homogeneity is probably indicative of a single social group in the Middle Park area. Child-sized hand stencils are found evenly distributed throughout the Middle Park sites. This, combined with the presence of women, and perhaps production of art by them, supports the notion that viewing of these art sites was not restricted. Although child stencils alone do not prove a secular interpretation for the art, as it is highly likely that children may have been involved in rock art production in ceremonial contexts, the combined evidence of women's, men's and children's stencils appearing together argues against a ceremonial context. Additionally, the presence of associated cultural remains in the majority of art sites, including axe grinding grooves, grinding surfaces and stone artefacts, indicates that the sites were used for everyday activities, as opposed to being visited only for ritual or ceremonial events. At Esmeralda, Gorecki and Grant (1994) argued that grinding surfaces in rockshelters were indicative of grass seed-grinding. However, the relative abundance of grinding patches in Middle Park rockshelters that also contain art suggests that here grinding surfaces were multipurpose and/or used for pigment production. It would be useful to conduct residue analysis of grinding surfaces at Middle Park, as the results would have implications for the above argument regarding the function of these surfaces and perhaps, by implication, of the art. Chronology of Art Production In the absence of direct dating of the Middle Park rock art, a basic chronological sequence is tentatively proposed herein based on superimpositioning. On the basis of the morphological similarity of deeply abraded circular motifs at some of the Middle Park sites with those to the east, these motifs may be of considerable age (at least 9000 years based on absolute dating of sediments which cover such motifs at Mickey Springs; see Morwood 1990, 1992, 2002), and potentially comprise the earliest art in the Middle Park study area. As noted earlier, four rockshelters have been excavated at Middle Park, two of which contain pecked engravings (MP 102 and Gledswood Shelter 1), and all of which contain stencilled art (Wallis 2003:151-156; Wallis et al 2009). Three of these sites (MP76, MP83, MP 102) yielded primarily Holocene ages for occupation, while Gledswood Shelter 1 has been dated to &gt;28,000 BP (Wallis et al. 2009). Although no directly applicable evidence for the age of rock art production has been found in any of these excavations, the contemporaneity of rock art production with other forms of occupation behaviour seems likely (as demonstrated, for example, by McDonald 2008; Morwood 1992, 2002). We propose that the initial engraving period was replaced by a stencilled art phase utilising a variety of pigment colours in shades of red, purple, orange and yellow. This style of production continued in the area in the post-contact period, with the occasional use of pigment to produce paintings. Preservation conditions and a limited amount of superimpositioning suggest that material culture stencils were added to the repertoire more recently. The heavily weathered condition of hand stencils in many sites suggests that, during the initial stages of stencilled art production, this technique was restricted to hands alone. Ochre fragments in the excavated deposits of Gledswood Shelter 1 offers an avenue for further investigating the antiquity of pigment art in the area. The most recent phase of art production involves the addition of lightly pecked engravings (sometimes as an embellishment to stencilled art) and the use of white pigment. Owing to the shallow nature of the pecked motifs, and their subsequently unlikely long-term preservation potential, it appears that this technique was practised into the latest period of rock art production. In the case of white motifs, the pigment used to create them is widely accepted as having deteriorated at a faster rate than other colours (Bednarik 1994:70-71; Chippindale and Taçon 1998), which, when combined with their frequent occurrence in recent superimposition layers, suggests their relatively recent production, a proposition in line with Morwood's (1992, 2002) suggestions for the wider region (see also Taçon 2008). Conclusion The elaborate figurative art of Cape York Peninsula and the engraving-dominated assemblages of Mt Isa provide a distinct contrast to the primarily stencilled art of the central and north Queensland highlands. Owing to stylistic and technical similarities, it had originally been suggested that the Central Queensland Province extended as far north as Croydon, encompassing the Middle Park study area (e.g. Morwood 1984:361). However, the results of this study show that while the assemblages are superficially similar, there is a significantly more limited range of stencilled motifs present at Middle Park, and substantially less emphasis on painted and engraved motifs. The stylistic homogeneity of the North Queensland Highland Province (including Esmeralda and Middle Park) suggests that there was no use of style here for territorial delineation. Stylistic similarity across the region is interpreted as having functioned to create cohesion amongst groups, with only minor regional variations indicating the presence of culturally distinguishable groups. By employing information exchange theory, which emphasises the notion that stylistic homo- or heterogeneity develops according to resource availability, population density and the subsequent need to facilitate social interaction or delineate territory (Gamble 1982; Smith 1989), it is argued that the people occupying the Middle Park area had no direct contact with the people of Cape York and rarely interacted directly with groups from the Mt Isa region. This is indicated primarily by the extreme differences in motif types and techniques employed in these provinces. In contrast, some contact between the Middle Park people and those of Central Queensland appears to have occurred, and was possibly facilitated through stylistic similarities in stencilling. However, dissimilarities between the two assemblages, the greater degree of heterogeneity exhibited in the latter, the different language groups and biogeographic zones involved and the extensive distances could indicate bounding or territorial activity between the central and north Queensland highlands. Further regional rock art studies will allow the relative homogeneity of the North Queensland Highland Province to be determined, thus testing the conclusions reached in this study. Based on the assumption that similar styles and motifs reflect open social networks, the nature of social interaction among groups in the North Queensland Highland Province may thus be further elucidated. More comprehensive surveys on Middle Park in a wider variety of landscape units would assist in establishing Number 72, June 2011 a USt ra lian ARCHAEOLOGY 31</page><page sequence="10">Style, Space and Social Interaction whether or not there is a difference between art located in close proximity to water sources, and those in less habitable parts of the social group's territory. Finally, in order to test the viability of the proposed Middle Park rock art chronology it would be valuable to also carry out a programme of absolute dating using mud wasp nests covering motifs (cf. Roberts et al. 1997).
