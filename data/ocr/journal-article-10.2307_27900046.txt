<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vol. XVII. JULY, 1907. NO. 3? THE MONIST AVESTA ESCHATOLOGY COMPARED WITH THE BOOKS OF DANIEL AND REVELATION.* THE CONCEPTION OF GOD AND THE TERMINOLOGY USED. AMONG the names applied to the Supreme Being the . expression "God of Heaven," also used in the alleged Edicts of Cyrus1 and his Biblical successors (see 2 Chron icles, Ezra, etc. ) appears to be certainly Exilic, even where it may now occur amidst matter formerly believed to be pre-Exilic It recalls vividly the universal Aryan name Deva,2 Zeus, Deus, Dieu, etc., for Deity, which in the Aryan vernacular was Div?&gt; "the shining sky,"3 so D(a)eva, to Indian div. In Avesta and its sequents the fine term became unhappily inverted in its application ow ing to theological antipathies and jealousies, and was act ually applied to demons through all Zoroastrian literature. But the Iranians themselves, as there can be little doubt, used "D(a)eva," originally in the holy sense, with all the rest of Arya, and the sad misuse is one proof more of the posteriority even of the early Avesta to the earliest Veda. Then the expression "living God" recalls the etymology of Ahura (Inscriptional Aura) the root being Ahu = "life" * For the most oart delivered in university lectures. 1 See Ezra i. 2 So first suggested by me in T. R. A. S. 8 See Daniel.</page><page sequence="2">322 THE MONIST. among other things; -ra is mere suffix. This singularly effective word is indeed applied to Ameshaspends, and even to a human spiritual Lord, and this in the oldest Avesta ; but we are none the less entitled to think of "life" and the "living" One when we meet its well-nigh universal application to the Supreme Deity, recalling also Vedic asura and its equivalents (see above). Not long since a scholar would indeed have cited Yahveh as a Jewish anal?gon ; and there is little doubt that the Jews themselves once mistook the word for the first person singular of the Hebrew verb meaning "to be." And this supervening and secondary understanding of the term, entirely aside from our restored modern explanations of it, quite fully suffices to establish an interior, if independent, analogy between it and Ahura. Analogies are often quite valid for the pur pose of tracing the presence and connection of ideas here apart even from errors or misgrowths; for "connection" quite as often reveals itself in grotesque anomalies. See even the striking inscriptional expression "King of Kings" applied to God in Hebrew as well as to the Messiah and to Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel ii. 37) ; see it dwelt upon below, whereas in its signal occurrence upon Behist?n it is used of Darius; yet this last insertion, though dating so late as B. C. 500, circa, clearly proves that the expression was predominantly Persian in its original application, for it is not possible that it could not have been used in Iran in the course of Iranian history centuries before it was applied in this same sense in the Inscription. And it therefore af fords a strong additional proof of a connection of religious ideas. So we hear of the "Ancient of Days," which recalls Zrvani akarane, meaning "in boundless time": see the Vendidad XIX, an expression of much importance as sav oring of philosophic speculation, but at another day (as possibly in the Bible4) it becomes a proper name for an 4 See Daniel.</page><page sequence="3">AVESTA ESCHATOLOGY. 323 Eternal Creator ; we have even a sect of Zervanites. Yet this connection, though subjected to a twist, is valid in ex actly the same manner, and deeply interesting. Moreover it must be clearly held in mind that a vast mass of anal ogies must be so estimated while yet cited : see on ahead, where no pretence whatsoever is to be put forward by me to any certain immediate literary connection. My objec tive, as already stated, is the existence of a post-Exilic intellectual atmosphere in Persian Babylonia, and so also in Persian Jerusalem, an atmosphere which was vital to the new religious aspirations of the Jews?in fact totally transforming them; and that this atmosphere was more Iranian than Babylonian ; but much detail of an otherwise very inferior character goes to make firm our convictions as to this. It is often a question as to what may have circulated as mere hearsay. Resuming,?we have again a firm clincher to the idea of eternity in the Deity as being an Iranian concept; and this is afforded by the name of the last Ameshaspend, Ameretat?t; recall "who only hath immortality"5 (Tim othy vii. 16). ANGELOLOGY WITH DEMONOLOGY. a. Distinction in Personages. Angelic personages become discriminated as to their rank as greater or less, in the Exilic and post-Exilic Scrip tures, and this marks still further the interesting change in the religious history of Israel. In the genuine pre Exilic period the angelology was extremely indefinite, hav ing been even thought by some to be a mere theophany, at best a simple messenger-sending from the Deity with 5 A curious expression for the Bible to make use of. It looks indeed as if "immortality" were a special title; otherwise what is the sense of it at all? Surely it is not a New Testament doctrine that no one but God has "immor tality."</page><page sequence="4">324 THE MONIST. out the supposition of any very distinct personal charac eristics in the supernatural messenger himself. We find also naturally little trace of any very exceptional hyper exaltations of individual angelic or demoniac spiritual be ings aside from, and independent of, their use as convey ors of the Divine wishes upon particular occasions. But in the Exile not only are some of these concepts apparently selected to "surround the Throne," but individual beings appear in a most predominant attitude as "Prince" and "Prince of Princes." (See Daniel viii. 25) : An especially prominent angel seems even intended to be represented as the agent in raising the dead, like the Saoshyants1 of Iran: See Daniel xii. 1, 2: "At that time shall Michael stand up, the great Prince which standeth for thy people." See also the expression "Sons of God" after the Iranian idea in Yasht XIII and elsewhere where the Iranian Arch angels "have all one Father Ahura." Whether the other two in Daniel xii. 5, 6, are to be reckoned as "Princes" is not certain, but the occurrences already mentioned suffice to show an exceptional eminence conceded to an exceedingly small number of these believed in supernatural persons. Similarly see also Daniel x. 21, where Michael, "Your Prince," almost demands a like interpretation to the expressions "Prince of Persia," (see Daniel x. 13, 20), and even to the expressions "Prince of Grecia." If it is written : "The Prince of the Kingdom of Persia withstood him, Daniel, one and twenty days,?and, lo,?Michael, one of your Princes, came to help me," then as Michael, the Prince was an Archangel, it would seem only fair for us to sup pose that the term "Prince of Persia" may possibly have some inclusive allusion to a supernatural being notwith standing the positive presence of Persian political person 1 He was himself not an angel, but the first recorded concept of a final Redeemer restoring all things; see elsewhere and below.</page><page sequence="5">AVESTA ESCHATOLOGY. 325 ages in the connection; and so the expression "Prince of Grecia" must be somewhat accounted for in the same man ner. Of course the word "Prince" here used has also its further and more natural application; and in fact it is quite possible that the entire use of the term "Prince" here as applied to the Archangels may have been first suggested by the necessary mention of the political Princes whose ac tion forms here the subject under discussion. Again, on the contrary, the idea may have been led off by the very prom inent position of the national Archangels of Media reck oned as "Princes," a leading one among them having actu ally the name of Khshathra which maybe rendered "Sover eign" or "Prince" ; so that, to be exhaustive, it is desirable to mention that even the "Prince of Grecia" in Daniel x. 13, 20, might point toward a semi-extinct angelology fur ther west ; but I fear we should be hardly warranted here. b. The Seven Spirits of God.1 It is in Zechariah, Tobit, and Revelations that a few of these more prominent concepts are spoken of as a com pany of seven ; see where I have already necessarily indi cated this by anticipation above, and what I shall say here should be regarded as being of the nature of necessary amplification. In the latter book this expression becomes frequent. Nothing could more accord with the Medo-Per sian Zoroastrian usage, which may also have expressed itself with a prominence which spread and maintained the concepts everywhere within the vast Perso-Babylonian territory. No one will suppose that I attach any especial impor tance to the number seven in itself considered, for it is of well-nigh universal application in Holy Scripture, possibly having had its real origin in the seven days of a week in 1 This is one of the collections of evidence to which I promised to revert, entering into more extended detail.</page><page sequence="6">326 THE MONIST. a month of about twenty-eight days ; but the application of this number to certain conspicuous believed-in angelic be ings is quite another matter when we recall the-Medo Persian Ameshaspends which were so widely known. Here accidental coincidence would seem to be rigorously ex cluded by the facts which I have already instanced above, for the existence of the expression in close proximity to the name of a G?thic Demon; see above, where an Avesta city more than once in the same document, places connec tion all the more fully beyond dispute. In Zechariah iv. io, "the Seven Spirits which are as the eyes of the Lord and which run to and fro throughout the whole earth," not only recall the Seven Ameshaspends, but their activity, which is everywhere expressed, or implied in the Avesta as in the later Zoroastrianism ; see also Satan's answer to God in the Introduction to Job, where he says : "I am come from running to and fro in all the earth" ; see it cited also elsewhere; and we have even the coincidence as to the "eyes of the Lord," the sun being the "eye of Ahura" in Avesta, as he is the eye of Varuna in the Veda ; for though the sun was not an Ameshaspend, but merely exalted in a quasi-personification, yet our main object here, as said above, is literary coincidence or color which may be ab solutely without interior correspondence and yet com pletely effective to show "connection."* In Rev. viii. 2, we have at once again "the seven spirits which are before the throne." Here the application of the same terms to the seven representatives of the Seven Churches (Rev. i. 20) should hardly be regarded as a serious objection, for these later expressions were evidently taken over from the ear lier words, which, as we see, occur in Zechariah and Tobit. It would be moreover a priori highly improbable that the "seven spirits of God before His throne" should have been an idea finding its origin in the fact that there were seven * Compare "the angel who took his part."</page><page sequence="7">AVESTA ESCHATOLOGY. 327 Christian Bishops in Asia Minor who attracted the atten tion of the inspired author ; see also below. Notice moreover the very solemn expression "the seven spirits of God" in Rev. iii. 2 and 7, which not remotely re calls the still profounder revelations in the Avesta where an analogous passage attributes the "six" spirits to Ahura as a seventh. This occurrence moreover surpasses its Jew ish imitations in one all-important particular; for these spirits were in so far really God's (that is to say, Ahura's) that they were literally the fundamental concepts not only of all religion, but of all possible moral existence, and so metaphorically indeed the very "Sons of God" ; see below for amplification to this point, being also in a sense abso lutely identical with Him, as the human attributes are identical with the human personal subjectivity. As regards Rev. iv. 5 (cp. also Zech. iv. 2, 10) I am not aware that the Zoroastrians had exactly seven lamps, or seven candle sticks, but the concept of the seven spirits pervaded the ideas of the writers, while fire (see above) was supreme as a sacrificial object; see also Rev. v. 7. In 8, the seven angels are again seen to stand before the throne recalling Job, where, however, the number is not mentioned ( see Rev. viii. 6; XV. ; xv. 6; xvi. 17; xvii. 11 ; xx. 19). The same deduction is everywhere in point, namely that while the concepts with their number "seven" are so very Jewish and Christian, they only appeared suddenly upon this He brew foreign soil as applied to particular personal spirits, whereas they were immemorially native to Medo-Persian Zoroastrianism which for centuries occupied the same ter ritory which was both before and later by constraint in vaded by the captives.2 A further explanation of this cru cial number seven should here intervene, and it will afiford an all-important illustration as to the asserted facts upon 2 The places where the Israelitish captives were deposited and settled were "Assyria and the Cities of the Medes."</page><page sequence="8">328 THE MONIST. which our entire procedure depends. For, like almost every other particular of the kind, it is not expected to go upon "all fours." Even the number itself wobbles, the seven being a post-G?thic term, as is indeed the word amesha, (better amersha), meaning "immortal," as applied to the Seven ; and it, the number seven, first of all includes Ahura. The Ameshaspentas without Him are merely six, whereas in one of the most important of all the passages, the Seven are all said to have "One Father," Ahura. But such irra tionalities are universal in ancient religious literatures. The number seven struck its impression deep upon the Iranian mind, having its obvious origin in the number of the Ameshas (Immortals) with Ahura included, and once having gained a footing it twisted their terminology. The word seems later to have meant the Holy Group entirely aside from the actual accuracy of the figure. That the names or the personified ideas themselves were purposely selected by the original authors to fit in with the already established sanctity of the number is less probable than vice versa, from the facts already just no ticed ; there is no idea of "seven" at all in the original doc uments, the G?thas. We might indeed surmise that an originally prevailing sanctity of such a number among the Irano-Aryan tribes, having returned more vividly to the consciousness of the later Zoroastrians, and also pos sibly having found its way in from without, they may then in the later but still genuine Avesta have adopted the term, fitting it into the fact that the "Six" with their Original, were indeed "Seven"; recall the Seven Karsh vas,?but the probabilities lie totally on the other side of it. The sanctity of the Six with Ahura, the Seventh, or as the First of a Seven, was of the most exalted and effec tive character possible, affording among the Iranians at least and their descendants whether actual or merely in tellectual, an all-sufficient reason for the excessive vene</page><page sequence="9">AVESTA ESCHATOLOGY. 329 ration for the number, as usual on rational grounds; for what reasons for the sanctification of any such figure could at all approach the fact that it expressed the number of the accepted, or recognized attributes of the Supreme De ity ? And even if the glimmer of the idea of Seven did in deed revive from an earlier Iranian-Indian origin, or even, if it did later creep in from abroad; yet even then it was obviously, notoriously, and almost exclusively appropri ated by the unconscious facts of the Iranian theological situation. No one who reads the G?thas with any recep tive capacity at all could imagine that those Six were especially worked out to coincide with the superficial and indeed artificial sanctity of any number elsewhere super stitiously adored. If that had been the case Seven would undoubtedly have been mentioned in them, the G?thas. If the number "seven" had any very especial sanctity in the pre-G?thic period that sanctity may have been pur posely nursed from religious motives, and it may have exerted a quiet influence even in the G?thic period, but in no degree such a powerful and dominant influence as it exerted in all subsequent Iranian history. Nothing is more pressingly important to all our con structive conjectures than to recall this principle at every step. Hardly an item, except these first cited, presents a mechanically exact correspondence. Another excellent ex ample should be noted merely for the sake of emphasizing our illustration. Aramaiti is rhetorically termed "God's daughter" in several places, and "His wife" in another. So Mithra is almost His fellow-God at times, and yet His creature at others. In more than one place Ahura actually sacrifices to Mithra and others of His sub-deities, just as a courteous sovereign would never formally address a nobleman without using his title. Ancient Gods also uni versally borrow each other's attributes, and in pursuing scientific discriminations as to these points the expert must</page><page sequence="10">330 THE MONIST. note which god is predominant in the possession of certain characteristics. Periods of transition also occur during which each leading god usurps or inherits the accredited deeds or powers of the others; and there are often dis tinctly marked epochs, where One God, as represented by his followers, seems almost to wrangle for an attribute with a waning predecessor.3 Periods of the prevailing ascendency of one God also overlap upon those of another. c. The Naming of the Archangels. While such a culmination was most possible as an entirely independent Jewish growth in parallel lines with that in the Zoroastrian scriptures, yet in presence of the immemorial Avestic and Vedic use, one at once recognizes the influence of the new Persian scene. The Jews, being Persian subjects, were perforce upon the most intimate political terms with many of the Persian officials, and they could not meet and converse relig iously with any Persian - Babylonian acquaintance from Media, without hearing at every sentence the name of an Archangel, for these fine believed-in supernatural person ages later gave the very names to the months and days,4 and this usage may well have begun at a date which would here come in ; and they were often used in the course of the day in private devotion. Their names also occurred often in private proper names, the Greeks themselves becoming aware of them (see below). What wonder then that they began, though at first quite unconsciously, not only to con struct intellectually their own personified religious con 8 See Indra as he supplants his predecessors in R. V. 4 Not only were many of the months named after them and their under lings; but the days of the month as well. Everything rang with the terms, so to speak, not excepting sometimes the proper names of the most eminent persons ; for instance in such a word as Artaxerxes we have the names of two of the immortals, ? Arta, which equalled Asha, and Khshathra; the prayer hours of the day, later five in number involved the constant recalling of the names.</page><page sequence="11">AVESTA ESCHATOLOGY. cepts, and upon the same model as those of the Iranians (see above), but to name them as well, after the same fashion which was ever upon the lips of their political and social allies. "The man Gabriel being caused to fly swiftly," etc. (Daniel) may be taken as a leading illustration. The few Zoroastrian "Immortals," unlike even their first imitations in Zech. iv, dispense with the supernatural limbs of loco motion, and especially with contra-anatomical growths for aerial excursion, but Gabriel, "Man of God," at once re calls the fact that Vohumanah represents precisely "the man of God" even in the G?thas, not etymologically of course ; and in the Vendidad he represents him in a manner so emphatic that there Vohu Manah, as representing the well-conducted citizen, may even be "defiled" through some impure physical contamination (see below) ; and we should not fail to add that the Zoroastrian angels have also a "flight" in descending to the believer, but as ever in the more refined form of rhetorical imagery rather than in that of muscular delineation.5 So when the leading priests in Persian Babylon began to think out for themselves Archangelic personages they would naturally give some such names as we have recorded; and so Michael "who like God?" appeared. We have noticed Gabriel as recalling Vohuman ; but he also recalls the exploits of many an Ira nian Angel, Sraosha in particular, though he, Sraosha, was certainly not at first recognized as an Amesha, yet he succeeded in pushing some of these leading forms aside in his progress as a defender. So in Revelations there was "war" in heaven and Michael the Prince contended with the Devil in Jude, just as Sraosha pre-eminently van quished Angra-Mainyus. But we must not go further be fore we recall and further explain the incisive circumstance that the Zoroastrian names differ radically and transcend 5 Yt. xiii. 84, 84.</page><page sequence="12">332 THE MONIST. immensely the Biblical ones in an all-important particular, already touched upon above, for whereas the Jewish ex pressions depict with color fine poetical images, the Zoro astrian terms express the first internal elements of the mental universe; see above and in the following remarks. Vohu manah, while used for the "orthodox saint," means distinctly bona mens; they may be the same words indeed in another form; manah is of course mens. Asha is "the law," the "idea of consecutive order," the "truth pre-emi nent" in every germ; Khshathra, the sovereign power, comes in also as if with conscious logic ; compare both the G?thic and the Lord's prayer f in the first we have "Thine is the kingdom," as in the last, with no very probable im mediate literary connection ; it is the idea of sacred author itative force; Aramaiti is the psychic energy of purpose, "the toiling Mind,"7 while Haurvat?t is the completeness of Deity, conferring full weal and chiefly health upon His "good" creatures, and Ameretat?t is literally "immortal ity," the two forms of exactly the same word. As approach ing this we have such expressions as "The Amen" ; see the Asha = Truth. Descending to the minor concepts; see above my allusions to "Hvarenah," etc. In addition to this we may recall the fact that Raphael, one of the Jewish Archangels, is actually declared to be "One of the Seven Spirits" in the Tale of Tobit which almost centers about the chief Zoroastrian city Ragha. d. Iranian Names Suggested Where Neither They Nor Any Semitic Equivalents Actually Appear. While Michael and Gabriel are in evidence on the Sem itic side and "God of Heaven" has been cited as possibly an Aryan element amidst the throng of Semitic terms, we may ? See Yasna LIII, 7 : "For 'thine is the kingdom* through which Thou wilt give.to the right-living poor." 71 refer ar to ar = "to plough" cp. aratrum.</page><page sequence="13">AVESTA ESCHATOLOGY. 333 proceed to notice such an expression as that in Daniel ii. 11, "whose dwellings are not in the flesh." This would be an advance upon earlier concepts where the bodily figure of Yahveh Elohim is plainly referred to ; and these finer ideas arose under the stimulus of the Exile, anthropomorphic modes of thought having been much shaken off, not neces sarily at all in imitation of Persian modes of expression. For even in the G?thas, a vision of Ahura is sought for, though a vision of Ahura as manifested in a bodily form would indeed introduce an element into the G?thas directly in conflict with one of its leading distinctions, that between the "bodily" and the "mental" worlds. In the later Yasna, however, we have His "Body," though everything points to a merely rhetorical (xx. 2) usage here as in the post Avestic Zoroastrianism, though I do not feel that the post G?thic Zoroastrians would have objected much to God's body, if they could only have managed the idea of it ; and it would have been easy enough to add the adjective "spirit ual" before such a noun as "body." A "God of Gods" (Daniel ii. 47) recalls again the inscriptional turn of words "King of Kings" and also its actual sentence "greatest of all the Gods," the Creator both of the Immortals and of Mithra ; see below. Strangely enough Adar, the angel of fire, is most significantly indicated in Daniel iii. 25 : "The fourth figure walking in the super-heated furnace is like unto a son of the gods." But "Son of God," i. e., of Ahura, was precisely a most noted and ever iterated title of the fire, as somewhat dimly personified in the later but still genuine Avesta. The spirit of the Holy Gods, in Daniel iv. 9, recalls again the Spenishta Mainyu, the most Holy Spirit, so the most; I prefer, the "most August Spirit." In the Avesta this "most August Spirit" is a curious growth out of the concept Ahura, much like that of the Holy Spirit in the Exilic Scriptures. It seems to be a sort of attribute at first ; and then perhaps it edged its way into</page><page sequence="14">334 THE MONIST. personification, as so often with similar ideas. The "watcher and the Holy One" of Daniel iv. 13 suggest Sraosha who "never slept since the two Spirits made the worlds; three times of the night and day" he attacks the enemy and defends the souls of the faithful. The "coming down from Heaven" (same verse) suggests the Six in Yasht XIII, where we have, "shining are their paths as they come down to the faithful." In Daniel iv. 17, the demands "by the words of the Holy Ones" again suggest the Seven; they all, constructively, watch and speak; and see "the Spirit of the Holy Gods" again with "Spenishta Mainyu" as its counterpart. The reader has long since, let us hope, fully seen the pointing of our procedure. While hardly a single in stance here cited shows any absolutely certain immediate and definite external literary connection with Avesta, yet the duty continually grows upon us to gather up not only the more prominent evidences of interior connection aris ing from parallel development, but the entire mass of them; for they undoubtedly accumulate force if only slowly, and they build up a structure of comparative theological doctrine which demands a universal recognition; and as it gains a hearing, it gradually but surely substantiates the Zoroastrian-Israelitish historical connection as well. To resume?see "the watchers" like Sraosha again at Daniel iv. 23. The talk of "the kingdoms" is again orig inal, and yet it again suggests Avesta Khshathra ; see by anticipation the "care of the poor"8 (iv. 27) cited from the G?thas above and below. This idea occurs more than once in the G?thas and also in the Ahuna Vairya. The "most high ruling" suggests "Ahura as king." See the "Spirit of the Holy Gods" still once more again in Daniel iv. 34. In v. 20 "the Glory taken away" from the monarch, sug 8 The "care of the poor" was a marked G?thic idea ; and in spite of a despotic government, if not in consequence of it, the "poor" seem always to have had some special privileges in Persia as against the aristocracy.</page><page sequence="15">AVESTA ESCHATOLOGY. 335 gests the Hvarenah of the Kavis as elsewhere. This latter, however, eluded seizure; see the Yashts. The word Sa traps9 of vi. 7 is pure Persian of course ; cp. khshathrapa van, though the Archangel Khshathra was not here at all directly thought of. The "Living God" (vi. 26) again suggests the same thoughts which originally determined the word Ahura; see above. See also "The Ancient of Days" again, which, aside from that most significant expression "in Boundless Time"10 recalls Ahura as he who is "the same at every now" ; recall "the same, yesterday, to-day and for ever."11 All the expressions in vii. 14 recall the Spirit of the new Persian - Babylonian religious thought, "indestructible kingdom" being also familiar to both. Most curiously both the ram and the he-goat of 8, appear in the Yasht to Vic tory, a brilliant Avesta piece, and likewise in the same order, with the ram first. Notice Gabriel's, "the man's voice," of viii. 16, the Prince of Princes of viii. 25 which ought always to suggest Vohu Manah, while Asha, who secured the first place among the Archangels, was later, as already stated, rudely pushed off the stage of action by Sraosha who is also elsewhere metaphorically aggres sive. "Righteousness belongeth unto Thee," originally arose from the same impulsive convictions which attrib uted Asha, the Holy Legal Truth, to Ahura. So Vohu manah was really "mercy" ; see ix, 9. In ix. 10, "not obey ing" arose from the same psychic forces which evoked the condemnation of ascroasha, non-obedience in Y, LX, 9, il There was also a "curse" almost personified in Avesta. "The Lord watching over evil" (ix. 14) recalls Isaiah xiv. 7, in contradiction to the implication that God did not create sin, while, on the contrary, Ahura was thus limited. 9 Darius's father was one of his son's Satraps. 10 Recall the Greek Chronos. 11 See above where "Boundless Time" itself became a deity and a creator.</page><page sequence="16">336 THE MONIST. See again "all the Righteousness of God," (ix. 16), recall ing the Asha of Ahura. "Hearken, hear, and incline Thine ear," (ix. 18), are emphatic and iterated G?thic ideas and words, and the first conception of Sraosha is "God's ear." So are "hear and forgive" ;* so also "bringing in everlasting righteousness" (Daniel ix. 24) is very Avestic as the first essential idea of Frashakart12 without which the supernatural beatifica tions comprised within that engaging hope would be of no effect; cp. "no envy Demon-made." Daniel x: the Yashts are full of "war"13 as are indeed the G?thas, these last have however no pictorial personifications to correspond. I cannot say what Aryan angel is suggested by "the man clothed in linen," though as already said, Vohumanah, representing "man," recalls Gabriel. In x. 11, "He comes" like Vohuman, so repeatedly in Y. XLIII; see x. 18, the same motives inducing both descriptive manifestations. In xi. 2 the "truth" is again Asha. In xi. 16 "doing according to His will" emphatically recalls the very characteristic and repeated expression of Avesta, "using power according to His will" ; see also the vasiy1* of the Inscription ; see also Khshathra again as the "Divine Rule" (xi. 17). I do not know what to suggest with regard to the other two angels of Daniel xii. 5. e. Unnamed Semitic Angels With Aryan Analogies. The Angel in Rev. i who leads and conducts the nar rator was suggested by the same idea as determined Sra osha to a similar office in the Book of the Art?-i-Vir?f of the later Zoroastrianism ; see also Y. XXVIII, 5, of the G?thas; so "in the spirit" (Rev. i. 10) is very Zoroastrian, though not exactly in the pointed sense. Art?-i-Vir?f, *Y. XXXII, h. 12 Millennial Perfection . 18 Cp. Yt. XIX, , where Ahura himself takes part. 14 Meaning "at will," "with complete sway."</page><page sequence="17">AVESTA ESCHATOLOGY. 337 however, was "in the spirit" much after the fashion of St. John, though in his case (Art?-i-Vir?f s) this took place with the assistance of a drug. There is also a prominent book called the "Spirit of Wisdom." "Writing in a book" reminds us that Zoroastrianism with Judaism was one of the very few prominent book-religions. The Son of Man again, as in Daniel, recalls Vohuman who represented "man."15 In Rev. i. 16, the "sword from the mouth" suggests the weapon of Sraosha which was em phatically "the Word of God," the Honover of Avesta.16 In Rev. i. 17, "the first and the last" sounds like a keynote of the Avesta, though there the Devil shared this primor dial eternal existence. There were "two first spirits" : see also the word ap(a)ourvyam, "having no first"; that is to say, "having none before it," which qualifies the superex cellence of the chants; see below on the "new song." Yet some expositors might well apply the term grammatically to Mazda Ahura. In Rev. i. 18 the "Living One" again recalls Ahu-ra; see above, here, however, apparently re ferring to the risen Jesus, whereas in Daniel the Deity is held in view. The description of the seven stars as the "seven angels of the seven churches (Rev. i. 20) by no means annihilates, but rather on the contrary assists our contention as to the analogies. The idea and the words as already stated, were taken over from the seven angels before "the throne." The reversed direction would be quaint indeed.17 The human Angels were addressed in the terms of common parlance. "I know thy works" (ii. 2) expresses the essence of Zoro astrian judgment; seethe first strophe of the G?thas. The "tree of life" (ii. 7) reminds one of Ameretat?t, which 18 See above. " See Yasna XIX. 17 As if the idea of "the seven spirits of God" was derived from the idea of the seven Bishops.</page><page sequence="18">338 THE MONIST. represented both never dying life, and later the vegetable kingdom which supported it, whereas in Genesis it recalls the vine with its supposed supernatural excitations, for which compare the H?rn Yasht which celebrates the same sacred influence, "he that hath an ear to hear" (ii. n) is again so significant in the Avesta that it has an espe cial angel, Sraosha, to represent it; see also the Yasna, where "Hear ye these things with the ears," twice intro duces the most solemn and far-reaching of all the doc trines. He who was dead and is alive again" (Rev. ii. 8), recalls the realization of the ideas which lurk in Amere tat?t and are expressed fully elsewhere; see below. The intervention of the Satanic opposition (ii. 9) is everywhere marked in Zoroastrianism, where it was first recognized; but the details of the Semitic allusions are here the most pointed. Periods of trial (ii. 10) are familiar throughout Zoro astrianism, and the keynote of all is final victory, certainly at least for the elect. "The crown of life" (ii. 10) is far more poetical than the mere immortality of the Avesta, though victory abounds in the latter. Satan's throne (ii. 13) is not positively an Avestic expression; but the coun terparts to Vendidad XIX, 32 (105), and Yasht XXII, have been lost; there "evil" thrones are due to offset the holier ones. We are also reminded of the top of Arezura, V. XIX. 45 (w) where the choice of spirits of the infernal world converge, doubtless under the presidency of their chief. In Rev. ii. 13, "Satan's dwelling" recalls strikingly the abode of the Druj, Y. XLVI, XLIX, the Devil's eldest daughter, almost himself. Idol-worship (ii. 14) is one of the chief things condemned at the judgment of the Zoroas trians. In ii. 17, the "Spirit" recalls again the "most Holy," or "August Spirit" of the G?thas exactly in analogy with the Holy Spirit of the Old and New Testaments, with no immediate literary connection. The hidden manna,</page><page sequence="19">AVESTA ESCHATOLOGY. 339 (Rev. ii. 17) also somewhat dimly recalls the immortal food of the Zoroastrian "Heaven," the Holy Oil of the beatified. "The Son of God," who has "eyes like a flame of fire" and feet like "burnished" and so "fiery brass" again recalls our Adar also represented in Avesta under the rhetorical image of personification. And we notice once again that the fire was "God's son," the expression often occurring. Rev. ii. 19, again recalls the first verse of the G?tha, "all works done with Asha." Both Zoro astrianism and Rev. ii. 20 are severe upon the harlot. In ii. 23, one "which searcheth the heart" recalls "on all with the truth (i. e., searchingly) Thou art gazing." The "Son of God" as "benevolent" sympathy (Rev. ii. 19) re calls the noted expression in the G?thas, "with Asha in sympathy," as also that which reports "the love of Ahura Mazda." "The depths of Satan" (ii. 24) recall the "things hidden" of Yasna XXXI. "Behold I come quickly" (Rev. ii. 16) recalls the G?thic expression "swift be it" (the is sue) as addressed to Ahura. Here we have as so often no immediate literary connection, but the two ideas were de termined by the same psychological moment. Vohumanah distinctly recalls the "beginning of the creation of God" (iii. 14) as he was supposed to be the "first18 made of every creature," not, however, an Avestic expression. See the "Amen" again for Asha in a most solemn and heart-touching sense from interior parallel de velopment. "He that overcometh" (Rev. iii. 21) is again very Zor oastrian of "Victory." In iii. 21, the sitting upon the throne again recalls the scene in the Vendid?d. The four and twenty elders on thrones (iv. 4) or round about the throne are exactly the Immortals in Vendid?d though the number there in V. is but a fourth of them; see below. "Vohumanah worked his way to the fore on account of his meaning which was "Benevolence."</page><page sequence="20">340 THE MONIST. Vohu Manah seems to sit down, if not with Ahura on His throne, V. XIX, 132 (105), yet upon a throne in His near vicinity ; recall where the Son of Man sits upon the throne of His Glory (Vohu Manah also representing the religious man in Avesta, as to which see below) ; the Deity also presumably presided. So the seven lamps of fire, (4, 5) have been already mentioned as a manifestation of the angel Atar (Adar). In iv. 6 the living creature full of eyes seems distinctly motived by Mithra with his 1000 eyes (see also Ezekiel). The especial homage to God as "the Creator" (iv. 11) is perhaps more constantly present in Zoroastrianism than in any other lore (see also the In scriptions). "Glory" in iv. 11 again recalls Hvarenah and its angel; see Power equalling Khshathra again. "Be cause of thy will" (iv. 11) is again very Avestic and in scriptional both as applied to Ahura and His saints. "Power" is again Khshathra (v. 12). "Riches" is Ashi Vanguhi; "wisdom" may be Aramaiti; "glory" again is Hvarenah. The "white horse" of vi. 2 is a striking symbol in the Yasht to victory; see also "conquering and to con quer." The "bow" was pre-eminently the Persian weapon, baffling the Romans in many an encounter,19 the "horse that was red" (vi. 4) recalls again the Avesta with the varying color; and so the "black horse" (vi. 5), all pre sumably in the sky, or on some conspicuous elevation. The angel of the Abyss (ix. 11) is Angra Mainyu, or his agent, ("face downward are the D(a)evas"). Recall Ezek. viii. 16 and the "twenty-five men with their backs to the temple as they worshiped the sun," pure Zoroastrianism, or the like. The "beast coming up out of the abyss," (Rev. xi. 7) recalls again the demon Angra Mainyu, who among his myrmidons certainly fled to Hell, which was situated in a downward direction; see in Vendid?d; see also Art?-i 19 The supply of arrows was furnished in camel loads and almost inex haustible.</page><page sequence="21">AVESTA ESCHATOLOGY. Vir?f. "After three days and a half" (xi. 9) vividly re calls the idea of the period during which the soul lingers around the body in Yasht, XXII; see also the approxi mately similar borrowed Muhammedan belief. (It would seem to be profane to mention the "three days" of the Gospels. ) Passing over much interesting and apposite detail we have in Rev. xii. 7 the "war in Heaven," elsewhere also often mentioned, which precisely in this connection recalls the war of Apaosha in the Yasht, whose enemy was then as now well thought to be drought, the great enemy of man in torrid climates ; this point in Avesta is again rational. "The Deceiver of the world" (xii. 9) is beyond all doubt a Zoroastrian idea of the Devil, whose central prod uct was the Lie-Druj (female demon). "The kingdom of our God" (xii. 10) recalls again of course "Thine is the kingdom" in the G?tha ; the expression of Royal authority par eminence, is Khshathra. This "Reign of God" is again pre-eminently Khshathra who was Ahur a's attri bute: "the temple of God which is in heaven" (xi. 19) re calls the same idea of celestial supernatural architecture in Avesta. The dragon of seven heads is, of course, the Azhi Dah?ka of Avesta, the Ahi of the Veda, which both had six heads, the six being changed to seven in Revela tion on account of the dominant influence of that number with possible reference to the Seven Hills of Rome. Like the Vedic Ahi, he kept off the rain.20 "The Devil having great wrath" (xii. 12) vividly reminds us of Aeshma, the demon of the Raid Fury, again quite a rational concept. There was also "an eagle" in the Avesta in the Yasht (xii. 14). The "worship of the dragon" (xiii. 4) was literally again suggested by that of the great rational 20 Notice in passing what I must refer to later on, which is the constant rationalism of the Avesta-Vedic concepts as against the Babylonian-Israelitish. One of the most marvelous of literary circumstances is that all the gods, or most of them, have meaning in Avesta, as in Veda and for the most part ab stract meaning.</page><page sequence="22">342 THE MONIST. Azhi Dah?ka (see also the Veda) who showed his claim to be the greatest of the devils, coiling his folds about the rain clouds, the dripping cows of heaven. The "angel with the eternal Gospel" (xiv. 7) is the Sraosha with the Manthra; so only in strongest analogy, of course. In xiv. 18, the angel who had power over fire is again distinctly an Atar whether directly and immediately so suggested, or by parallel development. In xv. 3, the "King of the Ages" again recalls Zrv?na akarana. "Boundless Time," which became a Deity ; see the sect of the Zervan ites already more than once noticed. At xvi. 3, the angel that poured into the sea recalls the Gospatshah of the Mainyu-i-Khard. In xvi. 13, the "un clean spirits like frogs" strikingly recall the fact that the frog was perhaps the most prominent among unclean beasts in Avesta. And let me also say here in passing that the Avesta alone affords rational explanation of the dis tinction between clean and unclean, from the fact that the Devil made the latter. Many animals (like indeed the very ones here in question, the frogs) were quite harm less except as regards some nocturnal voicings, and even used as choice food in some localities ; but they were ostra cized from the "pure creation," and solely because their creator was the Iranian Satan. Notice again the "Lord of Lords and King of Kings" (xvii. 14). The "angel having great authority" (xviii. 1) is again a fine Khshathra, Ahura's Sovereign Power. The angel "with the great mill-stone" recalls the mythical Zor oaster who assaults the enemy with an enormous piece of rock, "large as a cottage," so some render. The Amen (xix. 4) is again always a good Asha, Ahura's "Law and Truth." In xix. 6, we have Ahura reigning, in 7, again the glory, Hvarenah. The "marriage of the Lamb" (xix. 9) recalls the figurative concept of the "wives of God," and again, the sacred feast of the Zoroastrian heaven. In xix.</page><page sequence="23">AVESTA ESCHATOLOGY. 343 11, we have a rare bit of Zoroastrian drawing. The "white horse" once more immediately suggests again the "white steed" of the Yasht to victory ; see also the four-span white horses of Sraosha. The "faithful and true" one recalls the old Persian ideal (see Herodotus) ; it had its root in Asha. The "word of God" is again the Honover which was "before the world," and "the sword by which His angel slays" the Devil, so Zoroaster repels him in his "temptation" with it. The name upon his thigh is again our Aryan "King of Kings" of the Inscriptions, here fitting in especially because not applied to the Supreme Deity, as indeed also once in Daniel where as in the Persian Inscription it refers to a human potentate. In XIX17, we have the Hvare Khsh(a) eta as the shining sun once more; recall again Ezekiel viii. 16, with "the five and twenty who, turning their backs to the temple, worshiped the sun." The Ezekiel passages cannot be called pre-Exilic, nor, if they were genuinely of his date, can they be said to rank the Dark Inscriptions, which were supposed to be somewhat later; for, while it is absolutely certain that the allusion to the sun-worshipers was motived by foreign influence upon the Jews, the ex pressions upon the Inscriptions as positively prove that they had long pre-existing native predecessors; or that they were even stereotyped formulas; see whole sentences mathematically repeated in the Inscriptions on Behist?n and on those elsewhere which were later than Darius. This proves almost conclusively that Darius's terms were formulas long since used also by his predecessors as well, so that an inscriptional expression necessarily implies an earlier original in Iran; but the same argument does not hold with regard to the terms in Ezekiel to prove a prior Israelitish origin, because these latter were distinctly of foreign origin. We can not say in regard to those of Israel, as we can say of those of Behist?n, that these ideas in Ezekiel must have had predecessors in Israel. For it</page><page sequence="24">344 THE MONIST. seems to be distinctly acknowledged by all fair-minded and capable persons that the general cast of ideas as regards the eschatology and its kindred points existing in the time of the Exile and subsequently to it, was strikingly different from the tone of thought upon these subjects in the earlier Biblical literature. "Satan being bound a thou sand years" (xx. 3, 5) rests broadly upon Zoroastrian Chiliasm; see Plutarch's account of it; see also the later Bundahesh which is a pure development from the earliest documents; see also below. The expression "a thousand years" occurs more than three times in the Avesta itself, and all the other features are likewise marked in it. Re call also the expressions cited by Plutarch from Theo pompus( ?). The "Throne of God and of the Lamb" (xxii. 1) again recalls Ahura's throne with Vohu Manah. The angel sent to show the revelation (xxii. 8) again recalls Sraosha both in Yasna XXVIII and in the Art?-i-Vir?f. "The pure river of the water of life" (xxii. 1) makes us think at once of Ardvi s?ra An?hita, "the river lofty, heroic, (i. e., effec tive), and the spotless which purified all seed, and all generative production;" see also the other holy waters so constantly in evidence. Without laying the smallest stress upon any possible or probable immediate literary connec tion showing the influence of the Avesta in the above par ticulars cited from Ezekiel, Zechariah, Daniel and the Apocalypse, it is yet difficult to resist the conviction from the whole of them, that they conjointly indicate the intellec tual and esthetic world in which the Exilic and post-Exilic Jews and Jewish Christians lived ; and that this was domi nated by the scenes and associations of the Perso-Baby lonian Exile. But the Perso-Babylonian intellectual world was interpenetrated with the same type of conception and imagery which previously, or simultaneously, prevailed in the Median Zoroastrianism and in the religion of the Daric</page><page sequence="25">AVESTA ESCHATOLOGY. 345 Achaemenian inscriptions; and the "captive exiles" are twice pointedly said to have been re-settled in the "Cities of the Medes" as well as in Assyria. If this were the case the priests of the people were in almost daily contact with highly ritualistic Zoroastrians or pre-Zoroastrians, if I might so express myself, Zoroastrianism being of course only a culmination. Even had they never met the Median priests, which is well-nigh impossible, the main tenets of Zoroastrianism were daily forced upon their notice through the laity, who had later five periods in the day for reciting prayers, and may have had them earlier. Here then was "contact" and in pre-eminence. THE CONCEPT OF ETERNITY IN GENERAL. This is now a convenient place for us to pause and re call the main Jewish Exilic and the Zoroastrian concepts of eternity in general, more closely considering them as applied to the supposed existence of the supernatural be ings above discussed. As we have already conceded, the pre-Exilic concepts of futurity were extremely indistinct, but under the general inspiration of the Exile the other life began to take on its now familiar marked characteristics; see above. This has been our result so far. Prominent among the expressions used would be "for ever and ever" ; see Daniel ii. 4 ; ii. 44 ; the New Testament needs not to be cited. So that we have before us an en tirely fresh Dogmatik as to this particular in their Exilic and post-Exilic documents. But in the Avesta we have an "endless futurity" from the remotest inception of the lore and we have also in it, as we may well claim, the earliest expression of the idea in a refined literature and outside of barbaric assertions of it. This occurs in the oldest Avesta in such terms as visp?i y?v?i, "to all futurity," yavaetait?, "in the contin</page><page sequence="26">346 THE MONIST. uance, i. e., forever," as well as in the entire build and organic unity of the works which substantiate our claim for the Avesta that it is the first document of this concept. "Immortality" of another kind must have been thought of times without number wherever the human race appeared ; recall the common visions of the dead in cerebral hyper action, as in dreams. In our natural anxiety to do justice to the initiative of the Avesta upon this particular, we must by no means make light of this. Unquestionably indeed the thought of immortality in the Veda first acquired consistency from that of "long life" only, the "hundred autumns" of the Rik. The fact that the word for it is literally "immortality," Ameretat?t, the identical term, differing only in the suffix (see above), should by no means however decide the matter for us, as a beginner might so naturally suppose; for mere "long life" in this world, was certainly expressed by such a word as "non-death," just as by a curious anomaly "eternity" was, on the contrary, at times expressed by a word literally merely "long-life" as in the Veda ; and there is some doubt that the term dirghayu?or read dirghayo?does not mean "Thou eternal" after all in the G?tha; see Y. XXVIII. Be this all in the fact of it as it may, the idea is constructively applied even in the G?thas to Ahura as well as to His saints, and must therefore in such connections mean "long eternal life"1 while in the next oldest book, the Haptang haiti, the term Amesha (better Amersha, i. e., "immortal" ; see above), is directly applied to the Archangels, in which case this word Ameretat?t must certainly mean at times something very different from "old age." As to human immortality, see everywhere; but as to the more pointed particulars of the subject, see below. [to be concluded.] Certainly in Yasht, XIII, 83, where Ameretat?t has Ahura as her father.</page></plain_text>
