<plain_text><page sequence="1">Late Nineteenth-Century Marquesan Clubs: A Preliminary Analysis Introduction This is a preliminary discussion of the second phase of an on-going analysis of Marquesan war clubs, or 'u'u. In the previous issue of Pacific Arts (Ivory 1994:53-63), I reviewed the first phase of this study, which focused on the clubs collected during me mil ou yeaib ui bubiaiiicu Luiuaci wun liic woi (1774-1844). This article briefly reports on the work done so far on the clubs dated between 1880 and 1910,1 which are now in numerous museums world wide. The purpose of the entire study is to assist me in developing a history or change in Marquesan art, not only to determine when objects were made, but more Droaaiy 10 understand tne social, political, anu economic forces acting upon and being reflected in the arts of any given time period.2 Objects made in the Marquesas in the last decades of the 19th century were significantly dif ferent both in type and in style from those made in porKr rnntirr n^rirvrl rnnnl TKp 1 afpr y t - j s ' material is limited primarily to carved wooden bowls, clubs, paddles, and canoe models; all of which were made for sale. The aesthetic is distinc tive in irs overall surface carvinp which simulates. and I believe is directly based upon, the tatu designs seen on Marquesans of the time. When Karl von den oueinen u^zô 11.55; visiueu cue marquera;» 111 ioy/, he reported that, by then, "not a single old example [or a clubj was any more in the islands. 1 he clubs had long ago been dispersed all over the earth," as 1- _ j _ 11 ^1 « .. 1 L1 _ » /:L ; J \ X uauaii uicuuivi v amayiv Vx^aw..^a//.

Therefore, though the older style objects were long gone, men and women, many with full body tatu, remained as visu al models for the late 19th century artists. Scholars have often criticized the late 19th cen tury works as "degenerate." Ralph Linton (1923:392), for example, bemoaned the quality of Carol S. Ivory Assistant Professor of Fine Arts, Washington State University new clubs he saw in 1921, calling them, "only cari catures of the ancient specimens...[covered with] elaborate and meaningless carvings. In a perhaps more objective comment, Steinen (1928 11:55) noted their poorer wood, rougher carving, and a loss of particular elements he considered elegant in the older clubs. By the 1880s, life in the Marquesas was pretty grim. Populations of whole valleys had been deci mated, primarily by disease but also by lingering înter-trioai warrare. l ne arcnipeiago naa oeen acces sioned by the French in 1842, and between the rreiicn coioniai aunimisirauon anu me ramone mission, sweeping laws had been drawn up forbid ding central critical cultural practices, including tat tooing, dancing, kava drinking, and religious rites, including funerary ones.

Government administrators and res ident priests predicted the complete demise of the Marquesan people. As it turned out, of course, neither they nor their art died, though both changed significantly. Perhaps that is the most important fact about late 19th cen tury Marquesan art: though visually and function allv different from the msr. it emprperl as a rlistinr tive and viable art form.

The 30 clubs seem to fall into four distinct style groups, with a fifth miscellaneous category (see Table). With the exception of Style 4, they are all smaller and made of lighter wood than the earlier clubs. The later clubs are about 3' long, the older ones 4-5' and made of the heavy toa (Casuarina) wood. In general, and again with the exception or Style 4, they have low-relief carving, mainly derived rrom tatu patterns, covering their upper surraces. yvt* l • ^1 : i vv i Liiiii iiiv. nui iiiivv. i_i iv_ i v_ ia juiiiv- uvtiia^. a few have an element more generally found in one of the other two groups.

In the next section, I will briefly describe the characteristic of each style group, then provide a snort summary or tnese rinaings ana or tne ques tions that remain for me at this stage of my research into this subject. Style i This group includes ten clubs, three of which are slightly unusual (Styles ia, ib, and ic). I find six main characteristics that appear on all of these clubs and tnat aistinguisn tne style (.rig.ij. in oraer to under stand the first two, one needs also to be familiar with by Marquesan men. As with the clubs, there is an earlier and a later style, which Steinen (1928 II:i67 yi) identifies as the "tracery" and "tikihead" styles, rpcnprrn/p l,r Tlio nncci kl /=■ ctrrniPirnnrp r\P fhic rlnl-i n rr relative to the clubs, is discussed below. At this point. headdress is found on at least one side of the Style i rliih.c Thp rwn pççpnnal plpmpnrc jtp fircf rhp curved, horn-like motifs, which Steinen calls stirn boçen or "eyebrow arches," and second; the six heads arranged in a circle around a central point, like spokes on a wheel, which he calls "tikihead." Together, this motif takes up half of the upper "head" portion of the club. The only exception to this is the club categorized as Style ia, which has the arched brows, but not the circular "tikihead" design. Other distinctive characteristics are the "eyes" and "nose" of the club, which are similar to the early 19th-century clubs in that they are formed by small three-dimensional heads, either rounded or oval in shape. Between these "eye" and "nose" heads is a clearly defined oval area in which there is a design pattern that varies from club to club. The oval area (Steinen's umrisse) appears on all clubs of this group. In the case of Figure I, it is formed by four concen trie u-forms taken from tatu motifs, and called ipu. T"1!

The very bottom of these clubs tends to have a small square area with two small tiki figures carved back-to-back so that they face to each side. i.e.. to the left and risht as one faces the club. These are similar to those found on carved fan han dles from the first half of the 19th century. Style 2 Five clubs form the basis for establishing the Style 2 grouping, which has one sub-style (Fig.3), and one club (BERL VI24955, Style 2.3) that shares features • 1 1 1*1 1 / 1 • • Il S T-M Willi LI 1C IU11U àiyic V.U15CU5MUU uciuwy. 1 lie LU1C group does not have the uhikana motif on either muc, uiuugii d àiyiiz,cu iuini ui 111c cycuiuw aii_n appears on one (BASL VC1087). Rather than round ed "eyes" and "nose," the ones on these clubs are formed by heads that are square and blocky in shape. The cross-bars are also very square and flat and the designs on these tend to be very simple, one large motif or two small ones at most.

Although I did not include two clubs seen in it (b and d) because the detail is not clear enough to determine in which of my style groups to place them, they are undoubtedly the "late" style. These appear to be fully developed by this date. Their relationship to the Style 4 is indeterminate, though the great dif ference in their size is readily apparent.

Late style clubs were still being made in 1921, and given the other carving activity taking place, most likely on Fatu Hiva, and quite possibly on Hiva Oa and Nuku Hiva. The one group that is the most intriguing to me is Style 4. The Musée de l'Homme club is from the Dupetit-1 houars ramily collection donated in 1930. I have commented on this collection before (Ivory I994:^3)- The confusion comes from the fact that there were two Admirals with this surname in the Marquesas. Admiral Abel Aubert Dupetit-Thouars was in the Marquesas in 1838 and again in 1842 when July 1995 25</page><page sequence="7">ern part of the archipelago (where Nuku Hiva is located), which had been under French control for several decades by the time of his arrival, the style may also represent a northern regional one, as opposed to a southern one based in Fatu Hiva.10 he took possession of the Marquesas for France. His nephew, Admiral A. G. N. Bergass Dupetit Thouars, served in the Marquesas in 1878-80, and is credited with the pacification of the last two "hos tile" islands, Hiva Oa and Fatu Hiva. The objects in the collection are usually attributed to the first admi ral, and undoubtedly he did collect much of it. However, two pieces in this collection, notably this club (MHOM 30.44.63) and an uhikana in the late "tikihead" style seem quite possibly, even likely, to have been collected by the nephew. The Stolpe photo documents the type to 1884. Thus, it is pos cik1*=&gt; t-hor \\re&gt; rmilrl rlaf fhp \4T~TO\/[ rlnh an A uhikana as collected around 1878-1880. Given their similarities in size and wood type to the earlier style clubs, the style could certainly even be much earli er and be something of a transitional type. Another possibility: since the bishop Museum clubs accès sion data indicates it was collected on iNuku rliva, the Stolpe photo was taken in Taiohae on Nuku Hiva, and Dupetit-Thouars was based in the north Figure 5.

Notes The illustrations are from study slides taken by the author during research trips in 1987 while a Ph.D. candidate. Financial support for that time period came from various sources at the University of Washington, for which I am ever grateful. I would like to thank the museums for their generosity in allowing me to publish their pieces. 1. Several clubs are included that have later acces sion dates or unknown collection dates, but which stylistically are similar to the ones in the study. 2. A monograph analyzing change in Marquesan art during the 19th century is currently in prepara tion. With the assistance of an American Council of Learned Societies Fellowship, I hope to com plete the first draft of the manuscript this year. I welcome comments, suggestions, leads, or other input. I am particularly interested if anyone has information about the German trading store in the Marquesas in the late 19th century, and also on the Godeffroy and Umlauff companies. My email is: ivorycs@mail.wsu.edu 3. The translations from the original German are mine. As I've noted before, this is a critical resource on Marquesan art that really deserved attention and translation from the very dense, older German. I have some hope this may hap pen in the near future. 4. See Greg Dening's (1980) Islands and Beaches for a moving history of the Marquesas Islands. 26 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="8">Table.
