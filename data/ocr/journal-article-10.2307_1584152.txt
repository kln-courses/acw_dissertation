<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHY DOES CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA CALL PHILO "THE PYTHAGOREAN"? BY DA-VID T. RUNIA The evidence and the problem It is a well-known fact that the massive corpus of writings of Philo of Alexandria only survived because he was taken up in the Christian tradition as a church father honoris causa,' In our extant sources he is first mentioned by Josephus (Antiquities 18.258), who describes him as "a man respected in every way ... and not unskilled in philosophy".2 But this is the last reference to Philo by a Jewish author until the 16th century. We first read about him in a Christian author in the Stromateis of Clement of Alexandria (written at the end of the 2nd century A.D.). Clement explicitly refers to Philo on four occasions, but his actual usage of Philonic material is much more extensive. Indeed Clement's handling of Philo is an illuminating example of the way ancient authors were wont to use other authors as a source for their own writing. In her excellent and well-received monograph on the subject Annewies van den Hoek has shown that on at least eight occasions Clement had a copy of Philo on his desk as it were, and that he copied out extensive excerpts in the Stromateis, unrolling his scroll as he went along (on one occasion in reverse!).3 The four passages in which Clement refers to Philo by name are the following:4 1.31.1: Eptivuve6 et 6 O iXv ZTv "Ayacp apopixovaw ..., TIv Sapawv E a&amp;pXTiv .Lou.

(Plato the philos- opher posits as the goal of life "well-being", and says that this is "becom- ing like unto God to the extent possible", in this either coinciding somehow or other with the doctrine of the Law (for great natures who are devoid of passions somehow or other hit on the truth, as says the Pythagorean Philo when expounding the works of Moses), or because, as one who was always thirsting for learning, he had been taught it by learned men then living.) These references deserve further study. In the first, which occurs in the middle of an extensive section that borrows heavily from Philo, the Jewish author is suddenly introduced without any further indication as to who he might be.5 In the third text both the name and the work used as a source is given. Clement explicitly indicates that he has made use of Philo's account of the life of Moses, no doubt in order to give his own account of the same subject more authority.6 Here too Philo's name is given without any further description. In the other two passages the situation differs. Clement does add a description that tells us a little more about who this Philo might be. He is twice called "the Pythagorean". This epithet is used of Philo in only one other ancient source, namely the historian Sozomen, who informs us that according to "Philo the Pythagorean" the best of the Hebrews retired to Lake Mareotis and practised philosophy there.7 A single other text points in a similar direction. When introducing Philo in his Ecclesiastical History Eusebius tells us that Philo is recorded as having exceeded his contem- poraries in his zeal for the philosophical discipline of Plato and Pythagoras (so I translate Trv xaxra HaX&amp;ova xat fluOa-ypaov &amp;yoyTrv).8 This information may be derived from Clement, whom, as we know, Eusebius had read very carefully.9 Now in my view the epithet "Pythagorean" which Clement attaches to Philo is unexpected. It is surely surprising that he does not describe him as "Philo the Jew" or, as might be more likely, "Philo the Hebrew".'0 We would expect that Philo's role as a predecessor in the 2</page><page sequence="3">WHY DOES CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA CALL PHILO "THE PYTHAGOREAN"? Jewish-Christian tradition, i.e. the tradition that ascribes authority to the Hebrew scriptures, was more important for Clement than an attach- ment to a philosophical school of thought. In her monograph Van den Hoek devotes virtually no attention to the matter. Yet it is easy to see that from the historical point of view the issue is not without significance. As we have seen, apart from the brief notice in Josephus, Clement is the first author to name Philo. It is highly probable that it was through the intervention of the so-called catechetical school of Pan- taenus, of which Clement was a member (but of which we know perilously little), that the writings of Philo were rescued from the debris of Jewish-Alexandrian culture after the disastrous happenings in the century after Philo's death.'2 Just as from the textual point of view,13 so also from the historical perspective the early information supplied by Clement has to be taken very seriously. When he calls Philo a "Pythagorean", can this mean that in some way or another Philo was a member of the Pythagorean school? Naturally we have to allow for the fact that Clement may have been privy to information that is other- wise lost to us. If this is the case, we cannot check him. But we do have the duty to examine the question of why Clement called Philo "the Pythagorean" from as many angles as are made available to us by our limited sources. This is the task that I propose to take on myself in the present article. 4 It is, of course, with Clement that we should start. The answer to our question will be determined primarily by Clement's perception of Philo and other writers like him. The evidence of other contemporary authors is only useful to the extent that it brings Clement's views into sharper relief. I begin, therefore, with the contexts of the two passages, since they may well tell us something about why Clement chose to describe Philo in the way that he did. It will be more convenient to take the latter first. The text at Str. 2.100.3 After a long passage starting at ?78, in which Clement describes how the Greek philosophical doctrine of the various virtues is already located in the writings of Moses, it is concluded that "Plato the philosopher" has a doctrine of the telos which is the same as that of Moses (see text cited above). The formulation of the telos as s6o8atiovca and O6LOKtwaoS 0sco xarxa TO uvar6v, derived from Theaet. 176b, is of course straight Middle 3</page><page sequence="4">DAVID T. RUNIA Platonist doctrine.15 The convergence of doctrine is to be explained either through the fact that great minds can hit on the truth inde- pendently of each other, or because Plato, ever thirsting for knowledge, somehow came into contact with learned men who could teach him what was contained in the Mosaic philosophy.16 The latter alternative recalls the apologetic argument of the "theft of the philosophers", which is one of the pillars of Clement's argument throughout the entire work." The first and lesser difficulty posed by the passage is that the quote from Philo which is supposed to support the former alternative is nowhere to be found as such in the Philonic corpus. It is not impossible that Clement has in mind a passage now lost (e.g. in the Quaestiones or the Hypothetica). But I agree with the editors of Philo, Cohn and Wendland, that he almost certainly has a passage in mind which describes Moses' own education:'8 Philo, Mos. 1.22 Clement, Str. 2.100.3 io)XXa yap ai pLey&amp;XXat puaLSt ai yap J?ya&amp;Xat cpuELS xoa yuljvi val aov xaoVO'TOLOlL T(lV ?Tv eS7rtaJTXl:yn. .aTTOXOUait tCqg 7XEpt tlV &amp;X7,6i0tav. It is perhaps better not to place Clement's words in quotation marks, since he is giving the gist of Philo's words, not citing them verbatim. The context determines the change from itCLotjITIn (relevant to Moses' natural abilities that came to the fore during his training) to &amp;XaOltia (Plato's ethical insights). But then xalvoToLuo5al has to be changed too, for truth (in the ancient conception) is not found through innovation.'9 A further argument in favour of this derivation is that the additional words yutvai 7ia0xv clearly reflect what Philo says about Moses' asceticism at Mos. 1.25-29 (note especially Ta06xv at ?26). Moreover the cited passage is part of a longer section of Philo's work which Clement adapts at length in book I of the Stromateis (he refers to it in the third of the passages cited above in which Philo's name is mentioned).20 A final consideration is the ambiguity of the phrase ra MouaixoS eyou,TevoS which follows the mention of Philo's name. This may mean "expounding the writings of Moses" (i.e. a very general sense, equivalent to "in his commentaries on Moses"), or it may mean "giving an exposition of the facts about Moses", which could then be a reference to the biographical details furnished in abundance in the De vita Moysis.2' The latter view would further support Cohn and Wendland's view. It seems to me, however, that the first interpretation of the phrase is the more likely. 4</page><page sequence="5">WHY DOES CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA CALL PHILO "THE PYTHAGOREAN"? The second interpretative difficulty is that we must try to determine the intent and scope of the reference to Philo. A minimalist view would be that Clement is making an erudite literary allusion to a memorable turn of phrase in Philo. After all the contexts are rather different: in the one case the education of the prodigy Moses, in the other Plato's independent acquisition of a philosophical truth. There is, however, a complication. This particular passage follows on, and can be regarded as the climax of, the passage 2.78.1-101.1, the entire sequence of which is determined by large-scale (but wholly unacknowledged) borrowings from Philo's treatise De virtutibus.22 Is Clement indirectly making amends by naming Philo after the event in the expectation that the attentive reader will make the connection? The question to be answered, therefore, is whether there is any con- nection between what we just called the "erudite literary allusion" and the theme of the passage, i.e. the Platonic telos. At this point we should take into account an acute observation made by Dietmar Wyrwa in his analysis of Clement's use of Plato.23 He points out that Clement's men- tion of the 6OoioaCl Oecx formula is anticipated on two occasions earlier in the passage, i.e. at 80.5 and 97.1, and that both passages are taken straight from Philo (Virt. 8 and 168). This means that if the formula is now attributed to Plato, at the very least Clement has implicitly indicated his recognition that Philo's use of these phrases has a Platonic (as well as a Mosaic) background.24 It is tempting to connect this obser- vation with Clement's description of Philo as "the Pythagorean", even if formally and strictly speaking there is no connection between the statement on Plato and the reference to Philo. Whether this interpreta- tion is legitimate has yet to be seen. The text at Str. 1.72.4 The context here is less illuminating, and can be dealt with quickly. In this section25 Clement discusses the relationship between Greek and barbarian philosophy. He argues that (1) many of the first Greek philosophers (e.g. Pythagoras and Thales) were barbarians anyway, (2) Plato recognizes the contribution of barbarian philosophers, (3) many of the Greek philosophers studied with or learnt from barbarian philosophers, and (4) philosophy flourished among the barbarian races before it reached the Greeks. The section ends with a long series of witnesses. The first two are "Philo the Pythagorean" and "Aristobulus 5</page><page sequence="6">DAVID T. RUNIA the Peripatetic", i.e. our text. Thereafter Clement cites four Greek sources which support his thesis (Megasthenes, anonymi, Herodorus, Hermippus). There is no text in the extant Philo which explicitly undertakes to prove the antiquity of the Jews and the anteriority of their written phi- losophy (i.e. the Law). So Clement's statement might be taken as a rhetorical flourish. In most of his extant writings Philo shows little interest in historical details.26 There can, however, be little doubt that the apologetic motif would have met with his approval. Wendland's suggestion that Clement is referring here to a lost section of the Hypothetica cannot be proven, but certainly deserves serious con- sideration.27 Why then is Philo given the epithet "Pythagorean" in this context? No doubt because it boosts his standing as a witness. There is nothing remarkable about a Jew claiming the antiquity of his own race. Clement does not bother to tell his reader that Philo is Jewish. It does make a difference if he is someone who has an association with the Greek philosophical tradition. Philo's fellow-Alexandrian Aristobulus is also given an epithet that indicates a connection with a philosophical school. It is apparent that Clement's use of such philosophical epithets needs to be examined in closer detail. Epithets indicating connections with philosophical schools in Clement Before looking at particular examples, we must first address a preliminary question. What do terms such as "Pythagorean" and "Peripatetic" refer to? Here there is an important distinction that needs to be made. In the first place such terms will very often indicate membership of or affiliation to a philosophical ao'tpea, i.e. a philosophical "school" or, perhaps better, "school of thought".28 In Clement's time, as is well known, philosophers were generally identified by their allegiance to one of the rival "schools" that went back to the earlier period of the Greek philosophical tradition. These "schools" scarcely existed in the institu- tional sense to which we are accustomed (although in Clement's day there were some municipal chairs for the various oapioagt, and at Athens even an Imperial endowment). There was no central body that organized all philosophers who called themselves Platonists, but no doubt most Platonists would look up to the occupant of the chair of 6</page><page sequence="7">WHY DOES CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA CALL PHILO "THE PYTHAGOREAN"? Platonist philosophy in Athens.29 One could be a professional represen- tative of such an a'ops.at Such were the men whom Justin studied with-first a Sxro'ix6o, then a IIptcarMtiTLx6q, then a IIu0ao6p&amp;ito, and finally a prominent nIXaTzvtx6&lt;o-before he fell in with the old man by the sea. One could also be "affiliated" with such a "school of thought" without teaching philosophy professionally. Here we think of men such as Cicero, who regarded himself as an "Academic", the "Platonist" Plutarch, the "Stoic" Seneca, and so on. Such membership could be projected into the distant past, e.g. Empedocles could be called "the Pythagorean" because he came from Western Greece, was thought to have been a pupil of Pythagoras, and maintained similar doctrines (e.g. reincarnation).30 It is also possible, however, to use these terms in a different sense, to indicate not a membership of or an affiliation to a "school of thought", but rather an affinity to the thought of such an oa'psat. One can be a "Platonist" if there are elements of Platonic doctrine in one's writings, even if one does not regard oneself as a "member" of that school. The distinction between the two usages is necessarily somewhat fluid, and cannot always be accurately demarcated. That it is real can be illustrated if we now turn to some examples found in Clement himself. Clement calls various people "the Pythagorean" if, as he thinks, they were members of the ancient Pythagorean school, e.g. Philolaus, Epicharmus, Athamas, Hippodamus, and so on.3' On two occasions Clement calls Numa, King of Rome, a "Pythagorean". The one text is in the same chapter as the second of the texts analysed above, where it is claimed that Numa learnt from Moses not to allow anthropomorphic images of God.32 This information Clement derives from Plutarch, who in his biography discusses the possibility that Numa was an intimate of Pythagoras at some length.33 We note that in this text Clement argues that the Romans were taught in secret that it was only possible "to have contact with the most excellent principle (&amp;pa4ao0at roO PXaTCaxrou)" with the mind alone. The secrecy is Pythagorean, but the philosophy is pure Platonism. Quite different is the case of Pindar. Clement describes him as "Pythagorean" on account of the first lines of the sixth Nemead, in which the single origin of men and gods is celebrated (i.e. the Pythagorean monad).34 But there is no association of the Boeotian Pin- dar with the Pythagorean school.35 Here we have a clear case of "affinity of thought" retrospectively attributed. The only "modern" Pythagorean whom Clement mentions as such 7</page><page sequence="8">DAVID T. RUNIA (apart from Philo) is Numenius, in the famous text at Str. 1.150.4 where he is recorded as contending that Plato is none other than a Mcouoiq &amp;X- LtxLtov. The text itself does not tell us very much, but we may certainly assume that in Clement's eyes Numenius was a member of (or affiliated with) the Pythagorean ati'pes. The more difficult question here is what Numenius' relation to the Platonic school of thought is. After all the pronouncement concerns Plato, not Pythagoras. We shall return to this question below. Strikingly Clement, though himself probably trained in a Platonic school environment, nowhere describes any philosopher as a "Platonist" 36 As for the term kIIp1o0trtxxoS, it furnishes us with two surprises. Firstly Aristotle is once somewhat curiously called "the Peripatetic", but there is, one supposes, no good reason for excluding him from the school that he himself founded.37 Others given the title belonged to the Peripatetic school during Aristotle's lifetime and the subsequent Hellenistic period: Clearchus, Strato, Lyco, Hieronymus, Critolaus.38 Nothing unexpected here. The remaining surprise is, of course, Philo's fellow Alexandrian Jew Aristobulus, who is called "the Peripatetic" in the very same sentence as Philo is called "the Pythagorean". This case requires our closest attention. Aristobulus the Peripatetic Much ink has been spilt on Aristobulus, chiefly because he is such an intriguing figure, about whom we would like to know a lot more.3 He is the only one of Philo's Jewish-Alexandrian predecessors whom we know by name. If we take him to have flourished in the mid-second cent. B.C., then a period of nearly two centuries separates them. Cle- ment mentions him four times, of which on two occasions as "the Peripatetic". It would appear that Eusebius became interested in him through his reading of Clement. Whereas Clement cites only short pieces of text, Eusebius gives us four extended passages. This means that he must have had access to a copy of Aristobulus' work, an inter- pretation of the Jewish Law with an apologetic orientation. The Euse- bian fragments allow a number of further unnamed borrowings in Cle- ment to be identified.40 Clement's designation of Aristobulus as "the Peripatetic" is perhaps even more puzzling that of Philo as "the Pythagorean", for the extant fragments clearly disclose the conviction-similar to that of Philo-that 8</page><page sequence="9">WHY DOES CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA CALL PHILO "THE PYTHAGOREAN"? Greek philosophy is inferior to and indebted to Moses. This of course allows a rather eclectic approach. He in fact mentions Pythagoras and Plato twice, but Aristotle is not mentioned, and the Peripatetics only once. Moreover when discussing the significance of the Sabbath, he clearly indicates that God created the cosmos, a view which is difficult to rhyme with a Peripatetic position.41 The following hypotheses have been put forward: (a) that the title "Peripatetic" is a deduction from his writings, perhaps based on the reference to the ao'peaso x ox 6oe tepta&amp;iou in fr. 5, or perhaps based on a more general impression of his apologetic motivation;42 (b) that the title does not refer to a philosophical affiliation at all, but rather to a scientific and possibly biographical interest;43 (c) the very recent suggestion that Aristobulus may have been acquainted with the pseudo-Aristotelian work De mundo, and that this work is his chief point of reference in his orientation towards Greek philosophy, as particularly suggested by his reference to the divine 86vaFt;4." The assumption of the last two hypotheses is that the title was either a self-designation or handed down through the tradition, e.g. that it was found in the title of Aristobulus' book. It is difficult to argue against this, for there is no hard evidence either way.45 I assume with Walter that the titles are the work of Clement, or at least have consciously been taken over by him, and so tell us more about his perceptions than about the situation three centuries earlier. From him they pass onto Eusebius, and then further into the tradition. Walter's own explanation of the title (i.e. (a) above) is not particularly convincing, for it hardly puts Cle- ment's analysis of Aristobulus' writings in a very favourable light, but we have none better. Such hypotheses need not delay us any longer, however, for the fragments of Aristobulus himself and their adaptation by Clement give us a sufficient clue. Aristobulus actually speaks of his own "affiliation" when he says in fr. 4 that "it is confessed by all philosophers that one should have holy conceptions concerning the deity, which is especially well enjoined by our school of thought (/i xa0' 0tUs a'peqtS)".46 Aristobulus aligns himself with Jewish philosophers and particularly Moses. Clement does not allude to this text, but he does cite the passage which according to Eusebius stood a little earlier in Aristobulus' book, that "Plato followed the lawgiving of our tradition (Ti xaO' O&amp;qs 9</page><page sequence="10">DAVID T. RUNIA vo%to06ea()" and that "Pythagoras transferred much from our tradition (Tciv rcap' ijLv) to his own system of thought (Boy,JaTxoiaot)".47 Clement cannot possibly have meant that Aristobulus was a "member of" or was "affiliated with" the Peripatetic school. This is the relationship that he had with his own Jewish school of thought. He is called "the Peripatetic" on account of an affinity that he had with Peripatetic thought.48 Regrettably we are not in a position to determine with any certainty what that affinity in Clement's eyes was. Philo's affinity with Pythagoreanism This clear result in the case of Aristobulus will encourage us to undertake an analogous argument for Philo's appellation as "the Pythagorean". Philo, we may argue, was in Clement's eyes not a member of the Pythagorean hairesis. Such affiliation is reserved for his relationship to Moses.49 His writings, however, did reveal affinities with Pythagorean thought, and this will have encouraged the use of the epithet. Philo only mentions Pythagoras or his followers explicitly on a limited number of occasions,5? but Clement's trained eye will have picked up more themes with a Pythagorean origin. What, we may ask, may have induced Clement to regard Philo's thought, and thus Philo himself, as Pythagorean? Let us review four possibilities. (a) A prominent aspect of Philo's biblical exegesis is his heavy use of number symbolism or arithmology.5' On a number of occasions he specifically refers to Pythagorean number lore when expounding biblical numbers such as the monad, the triad and the hebdomad.52 Cle- ment takes over this method. There are at least three significant texts where he takes over substantial material on arithmology from Philo:53 (i) Str. 2.50-51: on the decad (exeg. Ex. 16:36, cf. Congr. 100-106; (ii) Str. 5.93-94: on the six days of creation, cf. Opif. 13-14; (iii) Str. 6.139-145: on the hebdomad in relation to the 4th command- ment, cf. esp. Leg. 1.2-20, and also Opif. 89-127. Moreover the reference to God as beyond the One and the monad at Paed. 1.71.2 recalls similar Philonic formulations at Leg. 2.3, Praem. 40, QE 2.68 etc.54 The possibility has to be considered, therefore, that, when Clement calls Philo "the Pythagorean", he is specifically thinking of this penchant for arithmologizing exegesis, and also of a connection with a theology of the "One God".5 (b) Secondly, we need to ask whether there are any other features of 10</page><page sequence="11">WHY DOES CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA CALL PHILO "THE PYTHAGOREAN"? Philo's thought that on their own may have been sufficient for Clement to have labelled Philo "the Pythagorean". Various themes come to mind, e.g. Pythagoreanizing esotericism,56 the goal of ethics as "follow- ing God",57 even the doctrine of metempsychosis.58 It will be agreed, however, that none of these are sufficiently important in Philo or suffi- ciently prominent in Clement's borrowings from Philo to explain the epithet. (c) The third possibility takes us in an entirely different direction. One of the more obvious features of Philo's writings is their extensive use of philosophical material from the so-called "Bible of the Platonists", Plato's Timaeus.59 As the passage at Str. 5.93-94 implicitly shows (Philo's name is not mentioned), Clement was perfectly aware of this connection.60 In Clement's day the personage of Timaeus was regarded as a Pythagorean (in the dialogue he is described at 20a as coming from Locris in Italy). Moreover a Pseudo-Pythagorean work, written in Doric and attributed to Timaeus Locrus, was in circulation and was regarded as the original from which Plato had taken (or even plagiarized) his doctrines.61 Clement refers to the figure of Timaeus (Locrus) twice,62 but nowhere does he associate him with Pythagoreanism. For this reason we are not justified, I would argue, in concluding that the epithet "Pythagorean" refers to Philo's fondness for this particular Platonic dialogue. (d) The final possibility takes us further along the same path. As is well known, during the final century B.C. and the first two centuries A.D. Platonists and (Neo-)Pythagoreans formed two separate aitp?aet, but from the doctrinal point of view there were strong connections between them.63 Indeed Pythagorean doctrine might be described as vir- tually identical with Platonist philosophy, with the addition of special emphases on the role of numbers (esp. in the doctrine of first principles) and on the contemplative life (together with various practical injunc- tions). The reason why this was possible is clear enough. Plato was regarded as having "Pythagorized", not only in the Timaeus, but throughout his entire oeuvre.64 As the more ancient figure, Pythagoras was the creative source, but Plato had worked out his thought in greater philosophical detail. In practice this meant that Pythagoreans could claim Platonist doctrine as an integral part of their a't'patS, but had more speculative freedom, because they were less tied to the study of Plato's writings.65 The best individual example is the philosopher Numenius. As Whittaker remarks, "in spite of his frequent designation as a 11</page><page sequence="12">DAVID T. RUNIA Pythagorean, the content of Numenius' surviving fragments is in the main more Platonic than Pythagorean."66 Turning to Clement, we see that he on various occasions associates Pythagoras (or Pythagoreans) and Plato.67 He argues that Plato drew the doctrine of the immortality of the soul from Pythagoras, and even locates a non-existent Pythagorean in one of Plato's dialogues.68 The suggestion may be made, therefore, that when Clement calls Philo "the Pythagorean", he is indicating that he has recognized not only Pythagorean themes, but also the dominant Platonist element in Philo's thought, for both aspects are covered under the single epithet. A difficult choice We are thus left with two alternative answers to our question. It is possible that Clement calls Philo "the Pythagorean" on account of the role that arithmology or number-symbolism plays in his thought, and especially in his exegesis. It is also possible that the epithet refers to the dominant Platonist strain in his thought. Which of these alternatives deserves our preference? It might be argued that we need not choose, since Clement may have had a plurality of reasons.69 Nevertheless I think it is useful to determine one's priorities on this issue, and although certainty cannot be attained, I believe that two arguments support the latter view. Firstly, as we said earlier, the context of the two texts in which Philo receives this designation is apologetic rather than exegetical, i.e. the antiquity of the Jews compared with Greek philoso- phy, and the derivation of the Platonic telos-formula from Moses. The second passage is also overtly doxographical (in the broad sense of the term), even if the mention of Philo strictly speaking refers only to a bon mot.70 Clement thus has more to gain from the statement that Philo was well-acquainted with a major direction of Greek thought. A second, admittedly less strong, argument is that Clement nowhere uses the term flXaxoovxos in order to designate a philosopher. This suggests that he may have wanted to avoid the term (for whatever reason), and preferred the more dignified title of HnuOaroperos. We thus find ourselves in broad agreement with David Winston when he writes:7' "It is thus clear that the expression "Pythagorean" does not preclude one from being a Platonist. Clement's designation of Philo as a "Pythagorean" was therefore probably not meant to preclude his being a Platonist, but was 12</page><page sequence="13">WHY DOES CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA CALL PHILO "THE PYTHAGOREAN"? used only to indicate that both he and Plato had "Pythagorized"." My proviso would be, however, that we take "Platonist" here to indicate affinity to the thought of an haeresis, and not in the stronger sense of a membership of or affiliation with such an haeresis (or school of thought). For it would be rash to think that Clement had overlooked the obvious fact that Philo's loyalty and devotion were primarily, indeed perhaps even exclusively, to the "school of Moses".72 The attitude behind the title There remains a final question to be discussed in relation to the epithet that Clement bestows on Philo. We noted at the outset that it would be more expected that he name him "Philo the Jew (or Hebrew)" as an indication of his ethnic and religious provenance. Does a negative aspect lie concealed in the epithet "the Pythagorean", that is to say, negative either towards Philo's Jewish background or towards his pagan learning? It was suggested nearly a century ago by F. C. Conybeare that Cle- ment may have given Philo this title in order to conceal his Jewishness:73 If we examine the references to Philo made by Christian writers in this earlier time, we find that they were rather ashamed to quote Philo; or, if not quite that, at least not inclined to regard him as an authority, whose approval of an institution should at once command its acceptance by Christians. Let us examine a few of these references... Clement of Alexan- dria in his Stromateis alludes to Philo as 6 IluOay6peto;. Did Christians of the late third century (sic) care for the authority of a Pythagorean? This approach is not convincing. In fact Clement's writings reveal sur- prisingly little contact with the Jewish community of his day (which may not yet have recovered from the terrible events earlier in the century), and certainly very little inclination to engage in open and direct discus- sion with them.74 Rather we should argue that both Clement and Origen had on the whole a relatively neutral, or even sometimes a selectively favourable attitude to contemporary Judaism.75 It was this "window of opportunity" presented by the Alexandrian tradition that was in all likelihood responsible for the survival of Philo's writings in the first place.76 Clement is quite happy to point out that Josephus is a Jew.77 The reason he does not do so in the case of Philo is presumably because 13</page><page sequence="14">DAVID T. RUNIA Philo's Jewish origin is obvious enough, and does not need to be underlined. The very first reference to Philo in the Stromateis involves the etymology of a biblical name. The reader could be assumed to con- clude that Philo as an exegete stood in the Judaeo-Christian tradition. If he was not a Christian, then he had to be a Jew. The title "Pythagorean" does not, therefore, conceal Philo's Jewish- ness, but highlights an aspect of his thought and writings. In this meant positively or negatively? The answer must surely be the former. Philo stands in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, but he is also a learned man, as expressed in the title, and in the eyes of the "liberal" Clement this is a positive feature.78 Admittedly, on one occasion Clement associates Pythagoreanism (and Platonism) with heresy, namely when he argues that Marcion derives his doctrine of the evil nature of matter from that source.79 But, given Clement's comparatively favourable attitude to the Platonist tradition, we are not surprised to read a few lines later that the heretic has misrepresented the original doctrine. Cle- ment's attitude is brought into clear relief when it is compared with that of his younger contemporary Hippolytus, for whom the titles Pythag- orean and Platonist easily become terms of abuse when brought into connection with heretical thought. Having given a summary of Pythagorean and Platonic doctrine, he states that it was "from this, and not from the gospels, as we shall demonstrate, that Valentinus drew together his hairesis (i.e. alternative mode of thought), and so he should rightly be considered a Pythagorean and a Platonist, not a Christian".80 The attitude behind calling someone a "Pythagorean" in this context is the opposite to that involved when Clement gives Philo the same title. What Clement regards positively, Hippolytus views negatively. The same difference is well illustrated by another text, namely the Sentences of Sextus. This collection of aphorisms was attributed by some to "Sextus the Pythagorean". Jerome in the 4th century strongly polemi- cizes against it as the work of "a man without Christ and a heathen", arguing that those who read it take over various pernicious Pythagorean doctrines and so "drink of the golden cup of Babylon".8' But the work in its Christian form, according to Chadwick's reconstruction of the tradition, was probably compiled between 180 and 210 by a writer whose kindred spirit was Clement of Alexandria and whose motto might have been Pythagoras saepe noster.82 This is close to the spirit in which Clement calls Philo "the Pythagorean", whereas Jerome's attitude is a continuation of what we found in Hippolytus. 14</page><page sequence="15">WHY DOES CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA CALL PHILO "THE PYTHAGOREAN"? Later sources As noted at the outset two Christian authors subsequent to Clement refer to Philo's Pythagoreanism. By way of an epilogue some brief com- ments should be made on these texts. If our interpretation of the Clementine title is correct, then it would appear that Eusebius, by describing Philo as "one who showed zeal for the philosophical discipline of Plato and Pythagoras",83 reveals a perfect understanding of what Clement will have meant by it. It is uncertain, however, whether Eusebius is here deriving his information from Clement's Stromateis. In this text he is embellishing what he read in Josephus, where, as we saw earlier,84 Philo is described as "not unskilled in philosophy", a passage which the Church historian cites verbatim.85 But where does he get his extra information from? It is possible that he recalled Clement's epithet.86 It is equally possible that he drew on his own reading of Philo in the library of Caesarea.87 Another possibility is that the source that he used for the legend of Philo Christianus contained more information on Philo. This source may have been the Hypotyposeis, an important work of Clement now most regrettably lost.88 The suggestion gains sup- port if we take the other later text into consideration. Sozomen too, as we saw, calls Philo "the Pythagorean". Where did he, heavily indebted to earlier sources as he was89, get his information from? It has been sug- gested that the passage in Eusebius just mentioned was his source.90 This is possible (though why should he choose the school of one philosopher at the expense of that of the other, which was in fact more famous?). But there is also another possibility. A few pages earlier (1.1.12) Sozomen informs his reader that he has written a short account of the history of the Church up to the time of Constantine in two books, in which one of his sources was "Clement" (in addition to Eusebius). He may mean the Pseudo-Clementina,91 but he may also mean Clement of Alexandria, in which case the lost Hypotyposeis would again be a can- didate, since we know that it contained much quasi-historical material on the Apostolic age. It is in any case probable that Sozomen's descrip- tion of Philo as "the Pythagorean" derives from the narrow Alexandrian-Caesarean tradition that we have been investigating. A final matter of related interest is the bon mot on Philo and Plato which began to circulate in the Eastern Church, and which is first recorded in Isidore of Pelusium and Jerome, I HXa&amp;ov tcpXovCet 1 tX,ov tXatcovet.92 One wonders whether the expression was not formulated 15</page><page sequence="16">DAVID T. RUNIA with half an eye on the well-known dictum that 6 IIXa,ov uo00ayopLtet.93 Certainly it was no less true to say from the contemporary Platonist point of view that i HluOay6pac crXa,TovieL i HXATnov 7ruOayopite than it was for Christians to say that II,Xa'cov cptXovit n q i',Xov cXaxtoviEt. Summary of results The argument that we have pursued in this article may be summarized along the following lines. When Clement on two occasions calls Philo "the Pythagorean", the epithet is surprising because it does not locate him in the Judaeo-Christian tradition where, also for Clement (in the light of his borrowings), he primarily belongs. In both cases the context, though revealing, does not explain the epithet fully. In one of the two passages Philo's name is coupled with that of "Aristobulus the Peripatetic". This second title gives us a vital clue, for it can clearly be shown that it must refer not to any kind of "membership of" or "affiliation with" the Peripatetic school, but rather an affinity of thought (even if what this is remains rather puzzling). For Clement, therefore, Philo shows an affinity of thought with Pythagoreanism. Two plausible explanations can be given for what such an affinity might be, more specifically the role that arithmology plays in his exegesis, or more generally the dominant Platonist strain in his thought (included under the title Pythagorean because it was recognized that "Plato Pythagorized"). The choice between these two explanations is difficult, but we opt for the second. Clement is not trying to conceal Philo's Jewishness. Given his relatively "liberal" stance, the title must be seen as a compliment in the direction of his Jewish predecessor. This positive attitude is important from the historical point of view, for ultimately it lead to the survival of Philo's works through the intermediation of the Episcopal Library of Caesarea.94 NOTES ' For a full account of this process see my Philo in Early Christian Literature: a Survey.

It is possible that Clement also refers to Philo at Str. 1.152.2, but if so, he is mistaken (it should be Philo the Elder, the historian, = RE (46)). 5 Note how Clement is heavily dependent on a source, but only mentions its names incidentally. This frequent habit of ancient authors was heavily exploited in the method of Quellenforschung developed in classical studies in the 19th century, an essentially risky procedure because the extent of the dependence can only be determined if the exploited source is still extant (in which case the results of the Quellenforschung are generally of much less significance). 6 Perhaps too because it is an unusual and contestable (since chronologically implausi- ble) piece of information. 7 Hist. Eccl. 1.12.9, referring of course to Philo's account of the Therapeutae. 8 Hist. Eccl. 2.4.3. 9 For example, at Praep. Evang. 9.6.5 he quotes the words of Clement that immediately follow his mention of Philo the Pythagorean at Str. 1.72.4. Nearly a dozen extracts from Str. 1.69-75 are cited throughout books 9 and 10 of Praep. Evang. I return to this question later in my paper. 10 As I have shown in a recent article, Philo is in fact not called "the Jew" in our sources until the second half of the 4th century. Until then he is "Philo the Hebrew"; see "Philonic Nomenclature", The Studia Philonica Annual 6 (1994) 1-27, esp. 14-20. " Cf. op. cit. (n. 3) 107, 179, 184. 12 See D.

See below notes 44 and 71 on the research of R. Radice and D. Winston. I have raised the question without giving an adequate answer at op. cit.

Origen's words at C. Cels. 4.39 could be taken as a paraphrase of/commentary on Clement's text: "It is not quite clear whether Plato happened to hit on these matters by chance, or whether, as some think, on his visit to Egypt he met even with those who interpret the Jews' traditions philosophically, and learnt some ideas from them, some of which he kept, and some of which he slightly altered..."

Radice, La filosofia di Aristobulo e i suoi nessi con il De Mundo attribuito ad Aristotele (Milan 1994), esp. 29 and 73-95. 45 There is only evidence from silence. The other independent witnesses to Aristobulus, the author of 2 Macc. and Bishop Anatolius, say nothing about philosophical affiliation, and stress only his Jewishness. 46 Fr. 4= Eus. Praep. Evang. 13.12.8. 47 Str. 1.150.1-3. 48 I prefer this formulation to that of Walter when he says the term indicates Aristobulus' "Bildung" (and draws the parallel with Philo as Pythagorean). Clement is not concerned with his education (about which he presumably knows nothing), but with the direction of his thought. 49 Philo himself does not use the phrase 71 a'peit xroo Mouaicos, but note the very common expression o( yv&amp;pqtot -ou Mcouaeox (e.g. at Det. 86, Spec. 1.345 etc.), the reference to the schools (BLtxaxaXtxa) where Jews devote themselves on the sabbath to the acquisition of knowledge, and the description of the Therapeutae as having -Tg atpi'aws &amp;dpX1TyrTaL who have shown them the way in allegorical exegesis (Contempl. 29). 50 Nine references in all: Opif. 100, Leg. 1.15, QG 1.17, 1.99, 3.16, 3.49, 4.8, Prob. 2, Aet. 12. This is a relatively large number if compared with Philo's practice in the case of other Greek philosophers. For example he mentions Plato only 14 times, of which half are in Aet. 19</page><page sequence="20">DAVID T. RUNIA 51 Best recent treatment in H. R.

(n. 3) 152-160, 196, 205 (she should have included this last passage in her group of "short sequences" instead of among the "isolated references"). 54 J. M. Dillon, The Middle Platonists (London 1977) 156 regards these statements by Philo as "an essentially rhetorical flourish", but does see a connection with the Pythagorizing early Middle Platonist Eudorus. 55 Cf. also Radice op. cit. (n. 44) 20. 56 E.g. the injunction "not to walk on the highways", cited by Philo at Prob. 2 and also referred to by Clement at Str. 5.31.1, which could be taken in an esoteric rather than a protreptic sense. At Str. 4.3.1 Clement takes over the Platonic language of the greater and lesser mysteries; cf. Philo Sacr. 62 and Van den Hoek op. cit. (n. 3) 188. This possible interpretation of the epithet "Pythagorean" for Philo is suggested by Radice, op. cit. (n. 44) 21, who also points to the prominence of the "contemplative life" in Pythagorean thought. Note, however, that Pythagoras or Pythagoreanism are not mentioned at all in Philo's De vita contemplativa. 57 Cf. Migr. 128-131, Abr. 60, taken over by Clement in Str. 2.69.4, cf. 2.100.4. In the former text Clement brings out the connection with Pythagoras more clearly than Philo, although he does not mention him by name (-rXt ov sap' "EXXrlat aopocv). The latter text follows just a few lines after the mention of Philo as the Pythagorean (see the text cited at the beginning of the article). But it would be wrong to see a direct connection with the Pythagorean formula IEoooat 0,ci , which Clement does not even mention here, unlike Philo, who refers to it twice at Migr. 128 and 131. 58 Referred to by Clement at Str. 7.32.8. It is far from clear that Philo subscribes to the doctrine of metempsychosis (cf. Runia, op. cit. (n. 15) 346-349), but there are a few isolated passages which an interpreter could read in this way if he wished (cf. esp. Somn. 1.139). 59 As investigated at length in my doctoral dissertation cited above in n. 15. 60 See n. 53. 61 See Dorrie-Baltes, op. cit (n. 16), texts at 24, commentary 253ff. 62 Str. 1.166.1, 5.114.4. The second text attributes a passage to Timaeus Locrus, but it is not found in the work under his name still extant; cf. W. Marg, Timaeus Locrus De natura mundi et animae (Leiden 1972) 85ff. 63 The last word has not been said on this question. See the comments of J. Whittaker, "Platonic Philosophy in the Early Empire", ANRW 2.36.1 (Berlin-New York 1987) 117- 121, J. M. Dillon in Dillon and Long, op. cit. (n. 28) 119-125, D. J. O'Meara, Pythagoras Revived (Oxford 1989) 9ff. But the question of the "institutional" relation between the two movements is still far from clear. 64 Dorrie-Baltes, op. cit. 247, who for the phrase 6 HlXdcwv 7uOrayopi(t refer to Aetius 2.6.6 Diels, Numenius fr. 24.57 Des Places, Apuleius Flor. 15. 65 As noted by Whittaker, art. cit.

Better is the explanation of D. Wyrwa, op. cit. (n. 17) 85, who argues in pass- ing that it means "die Gefolgschaft in einer philosophischen Richtung". 73 Philo about the Contemplative Life (Oxford 1895, repr. New York 1987) 328-329. His first example (left out in the quote) is Justin, but the works cited are pseudonymous. 74 Cf. my remarks at op. cit. (n. 1) 149-150 (with further references). At Str. 2.2.1 Cle- ment states that he will use some scripture texts in the hope that "the Jew may hear his words and convert from what he believed to the One in whom he did not believe". As Eric Osborn remarks, "Clement wanted to convert Jews and to do it quietly. There was traffic in the opposite direction. Clement attacked Judaisers in a separate work" (p. 148 in his forthcoming article in Origeniana Sexta). But according to Eusebius Hist. Eccl. 6.12.3 this work, entitled Ki&amp;vov IxxXTCntmaaotxo6; nIpo Tous 'Iou8Ot1ovraS, was dedicated to Alexander, Bishop of Jerusalem, with whom Clement had close contact after his depar- ture from Alexandria, and so may be the product of a quite different situation than the Stromateis written a decade or more earlier. 75 On Origen see also N.

Eccl. 2.18 is based. 88 As I suggest at op. cit. (n. 1) 7. 89 The extant history shows a great dependence on the earlier work of Socrates Ecclesiasticus. Prof. J. Bremmer suggests to me that Sozomen may have concluded that Philo was a Pythagorean because he drew a connection between the Pythagorean con- templative life and Philo's account of early monasticism (as he read it). I do not know if Sozomen was sophisticated enough to be capable of this. As mentioned above (n. 56), Philo makes no mention of Pythagoreanism in Contempl., but Sozomen most likely had not read this work anyway. 90 In the note at B. Grillet, G. Sabbah and A.-J. Festugiere, Sozomene Histoire Ecclesiastique, SC 308 (Paris 1983) 166. 9' As argued at ibid. 116. 92 On this saying see Runia op. cit. (n. 1) 4, 208, 313, 319 (where I argue that "the Greeks" among whom according to Jerome the proverb circulates are likely to be Greek- speaking Church fathers). 93 On which see above n. 64. 94 My thanks to the editors of this journal, to my colleagues J. Mansfeld and A. P. Bos, to Prof. Eric Osborn (Melbourne), and finally to the members of the Dutch Patristisch Genootschap voor Oudchristelijke Studien for various constructive remarks, which helped me formulate my views with more precision. As this article was going to the press Dr. Annewies van den Hoek (Harvard) kindly drew my attention to an important text that I had overlooked. Codex Baroccianus gr. 142, fol. 216 records a notice in which the fifth-century Church historian Philip of Side gives a list of the succession of the heads of the Alexandrian catechetical school, beginning with Athenagoras and ending with Rhodon. In this list Pantaenus (who is described as Cle- ment's pupil!) is called an Athenian and "a Pythagorean philopher" (text at G.C. Hansen, Theodoros Anagnostes Kirchengeschichte, GCS (Berlin 1971) 160). This state- ment contradicts the report of Eusebius in HE 5.10.2, who says that according to tradition Pantaenus had "started from the philosphical school of thought (qLX60aoos ay&amp;oyi.) of the so-called Stoics". Philip's statement is too short to interpret with any confidence. If it has any factual basis, it can be read in a similar way to my interpretation of "Philo the Pythagorean", i.e. as referring to an affinity of thought. On the other hand, the formula- tion of Eusebius' statement suggests it may refer to Pantaenus' affiliation before he turned to Christianity. On the notice of Philip see now the detailed analysis of B. Pouderon, "Le temoignage du codex Baroccianus 142 sur Athenagore et les origines du Didaskaleion d'Alexandrie', Archipel Egeen: Publication de l'Universite de Tours, Departement d'tudes Helleniques, fascicule 1, 1992, 23-63.
