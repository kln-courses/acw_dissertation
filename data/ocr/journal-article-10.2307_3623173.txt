<plain_text><page sequence="1">KIN TERMS IN THE POLYNESIAN PROTOLANGUAGES1 JEFF MARCK AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY Kin terms are reconstructed for Proto-Polynesian, Proto-Tongic, Proto-Nuclear Polynesian, Proto-Ellicean, Proto-Ellicean Outlier, Proto-Eastem Polynesian, Proto-Central Eastern Polynesian, Proto-Marquesic, and Proto-Tahitic. The Proto-Polynesian system seems to have contained about as many distinctive terms as some of the more "complex" systems of today, such as those found in Tongan, Rennellese, Taumako, and Eastern Polynesian languages, where "com- plex" refers to a language that names more distinctions. It is suggested that lan- guages with fewer distinctions, such as Samoan and the Ellicean Outliers, have simplified over time. Some of the reconstructions are questionable, especially at the Proto-Polynesian level, because of distributions that are limited to Tongic and languages that have clearly or potentially borrowed from Tongic (East Uvean, Anutan, Tikopian, and, to a lesser extent, East Futunan). Rennellese seems particularly conservative among the Outliers and has a number of agree- ments with Tongic not known from Nuclear Polynesian-other than languages that have borrowed from Tongic. At least two explanations are possible for the conservatism of Rennellese: the larger scale of its society in terms of numbers of people and in terms of named roles or relations of importance, and (2) it may include undetected borrowings from Tongic or languages that have borrowed from Tongic. Hawaiian kin terms are exclusively Marquesic where such matters are determinate. Hawaiian shares a number of demonstrable sporadic sound changes in kin terms with its Marquesic relatives (Marquesan and Mangarevan). It may share some such changes with Tahitic, but all such cases are indetermi- nate because the forms concerned are lacking in Marquesan and Mangarevan. This is consistent with comparisons of general vocabulary that suggest that, de- spite the prominence of Tahiti in the oral history of Hawai'i, Hawaiian remained a language dominated by its Marquesic roots. 1. INTRODUCTION. This paper reports on an examination of Polynesian kin terms from a linguist's point of view. Although some aspects of kinship behavior are mentioned, the main concern is with the terms themselves, and the overall an- cestral terminological system.2 Terms of reference are the central concern. Terms of address (vocatives) are mentioned only incidentally. Terms for the following Polynesian protolanguages are reconstructed: Proto-Polynesian (PPn), Proto- Tongic (PTo), Proto-Nuclear Polynesian (PNPn), Proto-Ellicean (PEc), Proto- Oceanic Linguistics, Volume 35, no. 2 (December I996) ? by University of Hawai'i Press.

The results indicate that the PPn system had: (i) One pair of sibling terms that distinguished relative age among same-sex siblings, and another pair that distinguished cross-sex siblings. These were: PPn *tua-fafine 'man's sister', *tua-ja?ane 'woman's brother', *tuakana 'elder same-sex sibling', *tahina 'younger same-sex sibling' (Clark I975). (2) An absence of special terms for cross- or parallel-cousins, and use of the terms for full siblings for all cousins (Firth 1970:281-282). There may have been prefixes to the sibling terms to specify cousins in general, but the sources do not report on this consistently, and reconstruction has not been attempted. (3) Naming of father's sister (PPn **masaki-tarJa 'sick-NOMINALIZER') in apparent reference to her cursing power over men of the family (although the name and/or power may be post-Proto-Polynesian developments around West- ern Polynesia). Naming of mother's brother as PPn *tu?a-tina, which together with the potential father' s-sister reconstruction constitute exceptions to the pat- tern of generational naming of first-ascending-generation consanguines. (4) Naming of a man's sister's child as *?ilamutu, which constitutes the only exception to the generational pattern of naming first-descending-generation consanguines. There is also a form that would reconstruct as PPn **faka-fotu 'woman's brother's child', but the evidence is geographically restricted, and the question of whether it was a PPn usage is indeterminate. (5) Differential terms of reference for children on the part of mothers- as opposed to fathers-in PPn. I embarked on this project with a pronounced sense of trepidation. The trail of exploration toward a theory of early Polynesian, Oceanic, and Austronesian kinship systems has not been straightforward. Several attempts at reconstruc- tion on the part of anthropologists have been found by linguists to be defective. Epling, Kirk, and Boyd's (I973) discussion of the "genetic relations" of Poly- nesian kinship systems was dismissed on methodological grounds by Clark (1975). Marshall's (1984) central conclusions concerning the Proto-Oceanic sibling-term system were similarly dismissed by Bender (I984), Blust (1984), Chowning (1984), and Clark (1984). Even Murdock's (1949) widely-cited assertions about the early Malayo-Polynesian kinship system have now been broadly challenged (Blust I980). In each instance, agreements between lan- guages in critical subgrouping relationships to one another allowed the lin- guists to demonstrate that the terminological system reconstructed at certain levels by standard methods of comparative linguistics was different from that proposed by anthropologists for the same levels. Since these criticisms from the linguists, work on the social anthropol- ogy of early Polynesian, Oceanic, Malayo-Polynesian, and Austronesian kinship has not flourished as the vibrant intellectual exercise that many of us would like to see. The Oceanic, and especially Polynesian anthropologists, are, I96</page><page sequence="3">KIN TERMS IN THE POLYNESIAN PROTOLANGUAGES perhaps, waiting for a definitive statement of what the linguistic data suggest on their own. Like the linguists, they are actually rather few in number. A few linguistic contributions have been made or are in progress. Blust (I980) has produced a linguistic analysis of early Austronesian social organization in which the kinship system was of central concern, and has more recently (Blust 1994) considered Proto-Malayo-Polynesian sibling terms and their reconstruction in detail, as did Fox (1994). The Proto-Oceanic lexicon project at the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, Australian National University,3 includes work on kin terms that was made available to me. It is hoped that the present re- port moves the comparative linguistic situation in Polynesia a step forward. The results are given for the various Polynesian protolanguages in Table I and justified in the sections that follow. Language subgroupings are given in Figures I and 2. 1.1 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM.4 Total kin terms in each Polynesian lo- cality grade from the most minimal systems in some Ellicean Outlier societies to systems with a larger number of terms in non-Ellicean Outliers and Triangle Polynesia. All are "generational." People of the same sex and generation tend to be called by the same term among consanguines.5 Granduncles are generally called by the same terms as grandfathers. Parallel aunts and uncles are gener- ally called by the terms for father and mother. Cousins are generally called by the sibling terms. 'Grandchild' always seems to include collaterals and not just one's own grandchildren.6 Some elaborations of Polynesian kinship systems that go beyond the mainly generational pattern were reviewed by Firth (I970), and inspired an important but unpublished paper by Kuroiwa (1975), in which further commonalities were noted and the findings reconstructed, where appropriate, to PPn. Kuroiwa sug- gested that PPn had special terms for 'father's sister', 'man's sister's child', 'mother's brother', 'older same-sex sibling', 'younger same-sex sibling', 'man's sister', and 'woman's brother'. Clark (I975) made those same sibling reconstruc- tions in that same year. The sibling distinctions are fairly well known and are com- monly (but not universally) found around Polynesia. Those distinctions, noted by Firth (I970), are now known to have been made in PMPn itself (Blust I980, I984, I994, Fox 1994) and to have continued into POc (Clark 1975, Marshall I984; see also Bender I984, Chowning I984, Clark I984), and PCP, and PPn. 1.2 SOURCES. We will be making very few reconstructions not found in Biggs (1994). But Biggs's semantic reconstructions are generalized, and those that fol- low are detailed. His semantic reconstruction, for instance, of PPn *tama is simply 'child', where we will find evidence to reconstruct PPn *tama 'child of a woman or couple'. Similarly his semantic reconstruction for PPn *fafine is 'woman, fe- male', where we will be interested in the evidence for the more subtle recon- structed meaning of 'wife; wife's sisters and classificatory sisters; brother's wife; women of a man's generation who are not sisters or classificatory sisters' and the I97</page><page sequence="4">TABLE 1.

In some instances, numerous sources were consulted, and what is presented in this paper is my own judgment of the most insightful definition coupled with the most reliable spelling. The failure to represent vowel length is the most common problem, as even some dictionaries do not do so, and the ethnographies rarely do. Notes, terms, and definitions from the sources can be found in the kinship database.8 Data given in this paper are linked to their sources in the kinship database and, when not from the kinship database, are from Biggs (1994). The sources used to build the kinship database are found in Table 2.</page><page sequence="6">OCEANIC LINGUISTICS, VOL. 35, NO. 2 The organization of Table 2 represents a revised subgrouping of Polynesian based upon Wilson (I985) and Marck (n.d.c), as shown in Figure 2. Figure I shows the standard subgrouping, and Figure 2 the revision. Samoic-Outlier (Pawley I967), found in the former but not the latter, was never argued on the basis of exclusively shared innovations, as were Nuclear Polynesian, Tongic, and the others (Pawley I966, Green I966). Wilson and Marck have since shown exclusively shared innovations for Ellicean and suggest that Samoic- Outlier seems not to have been a genetic unit. 1.3 NOTES ON THE SOCIAL CONTEXT OF EARLY POLYNESIAN KIN TERMS. We might ask whether PPn kin terms occurred within a patrilin- eal or matrilineal system, both, or neither, or whether there were named descent groups, and so forth. The answers are not readily apparent. Polynesian societ- ies commonly lack rigidly construed clans. The ethnographers have often been loath to call such groups as are encountered "clans" without qualification, be- cause they diverge from classical notions in anthropology of what clans should be. Often they do not call them "clans" at all, where flexible systems variously called "ambilateral" and "nonunilineal" occur.9 Marshall (1983:3-4) mentions something of the intellectual history of anthropology that tended to see such Oceanic systems as "fragile," "transient," and "lacking in internal order." Those more familiar with island societies know that this is not so, because they understand what those more accustomed to African and other systems have missed, that the land itself is the central corporate asset and that identity com- monly emerges from living on it, working its resources, and participating in decisions surrounding its use and resources. 1.3.1 PPn *kaaivja 'the land of a social group' and *kainaja 'social group'. It is not the purpose of the present work to reconstruct family affiliation or residence rules for PPn, and such a reconstruction may be beyond the ability of linguistic methods. Still, we might ask what named components of the ancestral social sys- tem might be reconstructed. Clear results were not obtained on this matter, but before moving on to the kin terms themselves, I shall do my best to lay out briefly the data and main possibilities concerning the two main terms, PPn *kaaiia and *kainaija. As with the kin terms, the various spellings and definitions known to me are given and linked to their sources in the kinship database. PPn *kaaija would seem to have referred to agricultural, and especially resi- dential, land of people belonging to a social group, and seemingly the dwellings thereon. The word is reflected with those meanings throughout Polynesian groups. The modern word commonly refers to the inhabitants of such lands around West- ern Polynesia (including Tuvalu and Tokelau), but this seems to be a post-PPn de- velopment, and that sense for the word is not known from Niue, other Outliers, or Eastern Polynesia. Instead, the people themselves or the group they belong to are often called by reflexes of PPn *kainaUa. Pawley (I985:96) reconstructs PPn 200</page><page sequence="7">TABLE 2.

I would reconstruct a meaning of 'clan' along with the following secondary senses: I. 'worshippers or attendants of a deity' (Sam, Ren), 2. 'subjects of a chief (Ren, PMq), and 3. 'commoners' (Ton, Euv, PMq). These senses become comprehensible in the context of Polynesian social and religious practices, whereby the most commonly worshipped deities were family ancestors, and the most common kind of chief was the ranking male of the kin group (however that group was constructed). Thus if PPn did have clans called *kainaja, it is not difficult to imagine that they were subject to the same chief, and gathered together to worship the same deities under the leadership of that (clan) chief.?0 The 'commoner' sense may have developed over time as the most senior lineages of the *kainaUa came to be remote chiefly people and the old name for the group itself came to refer to the mass of its members who were of common rank. Biggs (1994) reconstructs PPn *kaaija 'place of residence, home; people of the place' and PPn *kainaja 'some social group, perhaps commoners as opposed to aristocracy' (see Tables 3 and 4)."I As mentioned previously, the 'people of the place' sense for *kaaira is limited to the area from Tonga to Tuvalu and Tokelau, and I do not believe it should be attributed to PPn.

Data from languages for which I had no ethno- graphic sources (kinship database) are from Biggs (I994) or from dictionaries of those languages. The semantic reconstructions differ from Biggs. As for PPn *kainarja, from the agreements in the table it is clear that we can reconstruct the PCEPn, PMq, and PTa forms and meanings. The PMq and PTa senses are reconstructed on the basis of evidence internal to those groups. The PNPn, PEc, PEPn, and PCEPn senses are reconstructed on the basis of the PTa agreement with Pukapukan, Tikopian, and Anutan. In turn, the PPn 'social group' sense is reconstructed on the basis of the agreement of PTa, Pukapukan, Tikopian, and Anutan, with ex- ternal evidence such as Proto-Chuukic (Nuclear Micronesian) *kaina0a 'matri- lineal clan'. Note that 'social group' is a term of convenience for the present work. We will not argue precisely what kind of social group it was, but simply note that such groups seem to have had a name from PPn times that continued into all the major subgroups other than Ellicean Outlier. It seems commonly to have been lost in non-Ellicean Outliers, but does not seem a late prehistoric introduction to Tikopian and Anutan by way of East Uvean and Tongan influ- ence, for the semantics are distinct. Although internal evidence is equivocal for the highest level Polynesian protolanguages, the cognates in Micronesia make local innovations (to the same form and general meaning) seem less likely. Goodenough (1955:77-78) considered the agreement of Micronesian Kiribati kainga to the PPn form as regular and indicative of inheritance from a common ancestor, but I consider the Kiribatese form a likely borrowing from Polynesian on distributional grounds. The Kiribati definition is suspiciously identical to much TABLE 4.

Forms regularly agreeing with an early MC *kaina1a 'matrilineal clan' occur in Chuukic (Bender et al. 1983), and there are also matrilineal clans in Pohnpei, the Marshalls, and Kosrae'2-Pohnpeian having an irregularly agreeing form keinek.I3 Aside from Kiribati, the kainga form seems otherwise absent in Micronesia, and it does not seem to me so clearly a variant of kainanga as Goodenough (1955:77) suggests. The forms *kainaija and *kaiha clearly have distinct histories in Polynesia. It is only from Tonga to Tokelau/Tuvalu that the former term was lost and replaced by the latter (which retained its old meaning as well). Pawley (1985:96-97) shows that both seem to derive from a POc base *kai(n) "meaning something like 'person'."14 PPn *-(Ca)ja was a common noun-deriving suffix and is seen in both PPn *kaija and *kainaia. According to Pawley's (1985:97) ar- guments, *kainaja would seem to be an old form, because it retains the POc final consonant and was derived by *-aMra rather than *-Ja. Applying the same logic, PPn *kaija would seem to have developed later, after the loss of the final conso- nant, possibly in PPn itself. Because these phonological observations suggest that *kainarja developed in early Oceanic, we can support Goodenough's (1955) origi- nal interpretation, that is, that MC and Pn have the form due to common ancestry, and that it was used to name some kind of kin group. That is more or less the limit of what a formal linguistic analysis has to offer, and we are left with Goodenough's (1955:78) original question of how the groups were constituted in the ancestral society.I5 He thought the solution might be to suggest an ancestral affiliation system like Kiribati (the Gilberts) "which was de- rived from parental residence where the residence rule was bilocal" and that "in those societies shifting to regular patrilocal residence, the group automatically became patrilineal. Where matrilocal residence became the rule, the group became equally automatically matrilineal" (Goodenough 1955:78). As noted above, the *kaaija and *kainaUa words do not seem to me to be equivalent, as Goodenough believed. Rather, the Kiribati word and its meaning are best explained by borrowing from Polynesia.I6 PPn *kaai3a had to do with land, but it is doubtful that it had to do with people, whereas PPn *kaina13a seems to have had the 'social group' meaning for that language. The evidence now sug- gests that the cognate term in Proto-Micronesian meant specifically 'matrilineal clan', and probably 'exogamous matrilineal clan'. The modern term in Pukapuka also refers to matrilineal lineages. While it is possible that this represents a relic of the original sense in PPn, Pukapuka also has patrilineal lineages and bilateral kin groups (Beaglehole and Beaglehole 1938:219-233). The cautious linguist is loath to suggest a reconstruction to PPn on the basis of the Pukapukan agreement with Micronesian in the context of what seem fluid kin group concepts in Polynesia. Rather I think the ravages of time leave us with Pawley's (I985:96) PPn semantic reconstruction of 'lineage or clan', and no more. Whether to reconstruct it as 206</page><page sequence="13">KIN TERMS IN THE POLYNESIAN PROTOLANGUAGES patrilineal, matrilineal, nonunilineal, ambilineal, or something else presently seems beyond linguistic methods and must be argued by the social anthropologists on other grounds. 1.3.2 The father's sister, the mother's brother, and the man's sister's child. Before proceeding to consider Pn kin terms by generation I will consider PPn *?ilamutu 'man's sister's child',I7 **masaki-taga 'father's sister', and *tu?a- tina 'mother's brother', terms that constitute elaborations to the mainly genera- tional system. Kuroiwa (I975) reconstructs these three terms and discusses the first and third in detail. But that work is unpublished and remains the only source for the forms other than Biggs (I994), which is cryptic and also unpublished. In Tonga, a man's sister's children ('ilamutu) have special license whereby they may appropriate the portable property of the mother's brother (tu'asina), take possession of gifts given to him at weddings, and exercise other privileges that tested the mother's brother's generosity (Gifford 1929:23). There is a word for this license,fahu, which Beaglehole and Beaglehole (I94I:74) define more or less as "one who is above the law" and "the nature of the relationship be- tween 'ilamutu and their tu'asina." Rogers (I977:I67-I68) reports on Tongan fahu practices at a later point in time, and makes certain clarifications. This practice and the word for it are matched throughout Fiji (vasu). The word and custom are not found elsewhere in Polynesian, except in East Uvean, where the fahu privilege is "restricted to members of one lineage related to that of the king" (Burrows I937:63), and East Futuna, where the word is vahuI8 and the custom is a prerogative, not of all men's sister's children, but of all male rela- tives of the king, and applies only to food brought for distribution to a feast (Burrows 1936:72). Given the long history of contact between Tonga and Fiji, it seems likely the word and surrounding customs were borrowed by Tongans from Fiji, with East Uveans and East Futunans also borrowing the word and elements of the practices associated with it, either directly from Fiji, or by way of Tonga. Elsewhere in Polynesia, the mother's-brother/sister's-child relationship is marked by ritual relations whereby the mother's brother has ceremonial rights and obligations toward the sister's children. The relationship is characterized by affection of the child for the uncle rather than license. For example, Firth's (I963:200-206) description of the relationship in Tikopia centers around ritual connections where the tuatina is the iramutu's sponsor in certain rites of passage and is the principal in the burial of an iramutu who precedes him in death, while the iramutu is the principal in the burial of a tuatina in the more common circumstance of the tuatina preceding the iramutu in death. Hogbin describes the situation in Ontong Java as one in which the mother's brother "owes it to his sister's son to see that he does not lack anything with which he can provide him." He "is on the best of terms with his sister's chil- dren and they look upon him as an indulgent relative who assists them when- 207</page><page sequence="14">OCEANIC LINGUISTICS, VOL. 35, NO. 2 ever they require it. He may, if he wishes, take an active share in their educa- tion, and frequently he teaches them religious formulae that their own father does not happen to know. It is not perhaps regarded as strictly the mother's brother's duty to provide for his sister's children when their father is poor, but it is thought highly desirable that he should do so, and he is liable to be re- garded by the community as mean if he does not. Sometimes he actually adopts them into his own joint family. When such an adoption occurs, we have an ex- ception to the normal rule of patrilineal descent" (Hogbin 193 Ia:417). Far away in Eastern Polynesia, the relationship is echoed in the Marquesas, but there extended to children of all cross-sex siblings: "The cross relationships were among the most interesting features in the native system. There was a close cer- emonial bond between every child and the father's sisters (tuehine) and brothers- in-law (toete) and the mother's brothers (tunane) and sisters-in-law (toete), all of whom were called by the child his pahupahu. They in turn spoke of the child as their i'amutiL Ceremonially the bond between pahupahu and i'amutu was closer than that between parents and children" (Handy 1923:68). Kuroiwa (1975) mentioned that many Pn languages reflect *masaki-taua 'father's sister', but he did not give evidence or discuss the possible content of the role as he did for 'mother's brother' or 'man's sister's child'. Biggs (1994) does not yet include the reconstruction in his materials. It was possible to de- velop additional evidence for Kuroiwa's reconstruction, but what it may have meant was not immediately clear to me. Pawley (pers. comm.) suggests that it almost certainly comes from PPn *masaki 'sick' + *-Caua 'NOMINALIZER' and relates to the common cursing power of the father's sister over her brothers and his children.19 Subsequently, I found specific reference to such powers of the father's sister for Tonga (Rogers 1977:162-I63), Samoa (Mead I930:I37, I39- 146), Tokelau (Huntsman and Hooper 1976), and Tikopia (Firth I963:197, 207- 208).20 Aside from her cursing powers, there are often clear statements about the elevated rank and status of the father's sister around Western Polynesia and for Tikopia. This may continue some pre-Polynesian institutions (cf. Rivers 1910) and seems to have been a possible feature of PPn society. Douaire-Marsandon (I996) has recently reviewed the matter for Tonga. Here we are simply con- cemed with the reconstruction of terminologies and the general reasons for why certain terms may have existed beyond the generational core. The evidence for the reconstruction is discussed in some detail in 2.2 on first-ascending-generation consanguines (see Table 17). It is a somewhat equivocal reconstruction at the PPn level, as explained in those materials. 2. TERMS FOR CONSANGUINES. The organization of the following sub- sections is by generation. The data cited in support of the reconstructions in the various datasets come from the kinship database, wherein the data are linked to their sources. 208</page><page sequence="15">KIN TERMS IN THE POLYNESIAN PROTOLANGUAGES 2.1 CONSANGUINES OF THE GRANDPARENTS' GENERATION (-2) 2.1.1 PPn *tupuna 'grandparent'. The 'grandparent' term, PPn *tupuna, follows the pattern of many PPn kin terms: it has added the POc third person singular possessive marker to an old root, POc *tubu in this case. Many other PPn kinship terms show the same addition, as seen in Table 5. Tables 6-8 give the reconstructions for 'grandparent', 'grandfather', and 'grandmother'. There are no other reconstructable terms for the 'grandparent' and ascend- ing generations for PPn, although there are for some Eastern Polynesian protolanguages. These are mentioned in 2.1.2. PNPn, PEc, PEcO, and PTa terms for 'grandfather' are reconstructed in Table 7. No 'grandfather' term can be reconstructed to PPn, PTo, PEPn, PCEPn, or PMq, due to various critical failures to agree, especially in Tongic, Marquesic, and Rapanui. The Niuean agreement with Tahitic could be an independent develop- ment, or borrowing from Eastern Polynesia. In all instances where the sources have commented on the issue, *tupuna reflexes translate most generally as 'grandparents and ancestors of higher gen- erations along with collaterals of grandparents' and higher generations'. Speci- fications of which generation or line is involved are made by stating 'father's father's brother' or whatever the exact relationship is.2I 2.1.2 (Great)-great-grandparents. There is an exact agreement between Hawaiian and Manihiki concerning the naming of great and great-great-grand- parents, and a partial agreement between these and Tongan, as can be seen in Table 9. The final morphemes in each construction are the numbers 'two' in the case of the *rua reflexes, and 'three' in the case of the *tolu reflexes. Thus the con- structions translate freely as 'grandparent twice over' and 'grandparent thrice TABLE 5.

Fijian has similar constructions (tubu- vaka-rua, tubu- vaka-tolu). Sources for other languages are often vague at this level, incomplete, or state flatly that the local *tupuna form refers to grandparents and all higher order ancestors. The result in each instance is an absence of further agreeing forms. The simple addition of 'second' or 'num- ber two' qualifiers could easily have occurred independently, and distributional evidence suggests this is possible in the case of Hawaiian and Manihiki, for there is a competing Eastern Polynesian form. The competing reconstruction involves the agreements of a number of East- ern Polynesian language compounds involving reflexes of PPn *sina &gt; PNPn &gt; PEc &gt; PEcO, PEPn &gt; PCEPn *hina 'grey hair' (see Table Io).

Maori whaka-hina 'poetical expression for grandchildren'). The situation is confused by the more common contemporary use of these terms for great- and great-great-grandchildren around Eastern Polynesian (see 2.5). Possibly there was a term that developed around the se- nior generations, became a reciprocal term, and then came to be more com- monly used in reference to descendants than to ancestors. The agreements naming people from ascending generations are given immediately below. The agreements naming people from descending generations are given in 2.5. Rangiroa is one of the Tuamotus closest to the Marquesas, so this applica- tion of the *hina terms to ascending generations may be local diffusion of some sort. Marquesan tau and Rangiroa tapu disagree in Rangiroa's second conso- nant. As addition or loss of PPn *p is otherwise unknown (Marck n.d.c), the words are probably from different historical sources. 2.1.3 Related forms. There are some words similar to *tupuna found only in Western Polynesia (including the Tokelaus) that may have developed and spread there after the divergence of Eastern Polynesian and the Outliers. The forms are not presently known from any Outlier or Eastern language (other than Anutan, which has borrowed from East Uvean and Tongan), and one of the Samoan forms shows an unexpected agreement with the Ton/Efu/Euv glot- tal stop.22 The forms concerned are given in Table I I. The sources commonly give tupunga as a doublet of tupu-'anga, and there may be some confusion over two different words. In every case, they are said to mean 'source, cause, ancestor', among other things, and when one member of a doublet is said to have the specific 'ancestor' meaning, it is usually said to be tupunga,23 which is a meaning commonly attributed to *tupuna reflexes around Polynesia. Thus there is the question as to whether PPn had *tupuna 'grandpar- ent' and *tupurja 'ancestor'. But reflexes of *tupurja are not currently known from outside of Western Polynesia (and Tokelau).

The second word in Table I I, *tupu-laia, means 'adolescent' in East Futunan and East Uvean, while it means, more generally, age sets or generations in Samoan, Tokelauan, and Anutan. There are many reconstructed meanings for *laJa or *ra1a in Biggs (1994), including 'weave', 'raise (up)', and 'cultivate soil'. Pawley (pers. comm.) notes the similarity to N.Z. Maori whaka-tupu-ranga 'generational group', and wonders whether -ranga is from the nominalizer PPn *-Ja or *-Caja coupled to PPn *tupu 'grow'. Since at least POc times, *tupu has been polysemous, mean- ing both 'grandparent' and 'grow', and there seems a tendency in Polynesian lan- guages to develop new forms around one or the other sense and apply them to growth, generations, ancestry, and the like. The absence of other known EPn agreements, or agreements in the Outliers other than Anutan, raises the possibility that the *tupu-rala word developed independently in Western Polynesia and in N.Z. Maori. This may seem a tedious discussion, but it speaks to two issues: the question as to whether there was a PPn *tupula 'ancestor' (there may not have been), and the question as to whether social terminologies were being shared around Western Polynesia after the divergence of Eastern and the Outliers (in this particular case, it seems quite likely that such took place). 2.2 CONSANGUINES OF THE PARENTS' GENERATION (-1). For the parental generation in PPn, there were 'parent' and 'father' and 'mother' terms, and there seem also to have been special terms for the parents' cross-sex siblings (where parents' same-sex siblings were simply called 'father' and 'mother'). See the discussion of the 'father's sister' and 'mother's brother' social roles in 1.3.2. PPn seems not to have had an equation of 'mother's brother' with 'parent- in-law' such as there may have been in PMPn (PMPn *ma-tu?ah 'I. mother's brother, mother's brother's wife, 2. wife's father, wife's mother'24&gt; POc *matu?a 'mother's brother' &gt; PPn *matu?a25 'I. parents, 2. collaterals of parent's genera- tion and their spouses, 3. mature people in general').

There is often an equivalence of 'mother's brother' and 'wife's father' in Fijian languages, and the term em- ployed is often of the form vuga- or g(w)adina- (Capell and Lester I945). This does not seem to be cognate with any Polynesian kin term, and Polynesian and Fijian kin terms seem to have become somewhat distinct from early times. As seen above, the PPn term for 'mother's brother' continues the POc 'mother's brother' term, but in the Pn languages this form does not have the meaning 'wife's father', except in West Futuna and Rennellese, which seem to have developed that meaning independently. 2.2.1 PPn *matu?a 'parent' and PPn *maatu?a 'parents'. We will now con- sider the individual reconstructions, starting with the most general term for people of the first ascending generation (-I), PPn *matu?a 'parent and collaterals of that generation; spouses of the parental generation's lineals and collaterals; parents' age mates'. More generally, PPn *matu?a meant 'mature, old (of people)' and had this meaning in earlier ancestral languages (Biggs 1994). I would also suggest it meant 'ripe, of fruit' in PPn. The evidence internal to Polynesian for PPn *matu?a 'parent' is at least that seen in Table I2. There was a PPn plural *maatu?a '(human) parents' (Biggs I994), with reflexes reported from enough languages to suggest that it existed in PTo, PNPn, PEc, PEPn, PCEPn, PMq, and PTa. The known reflexes of the plural have more stable form and meaning correspondences than the singular (it always means 'parents'). PPn *matu?a is commonly retained in Eastern Polynesia where the PPn words for 'mother' and 'father' were abandoned, and 'mother' and 'father' seem to have been called 'female parent' and 'male parent' by PEPn times (see Table 13). It is clear that we should reconstruct PTa *m(a,e)tua26 wahine 'mother' and *m(a,e)tua27 taane 'father'. There are, however, numerous formal difficulties with the precise reconstruction of the 'mother' and 'father' constructions for PEPn, PCEPn, and PMq. This is due to the general possibility of borrowing from Tahitic in Rapanui and Hawaiian, and the idiosyncratic forms common to TABLE 12.

We have rea- son to believe that Rapanui did not borrow from Tahitian in this instance, be- cause the vowels do not show the Tahitian change (*matua &gt; metua), and be- cause Rapanui uses the 'male child' and 'female child' terms as gender modifi- ers, where Tahitian uses the simple 'male' and 'female' words. Similarly, we also have reason to believe that Hawaiian did not borrow from Tahitian, be- cause it uses the feminine suffix -hine rather than the full word for 'woman'. Still, it is possible that Tahitic influenced Hawaiian, and that PCEPn and PMq had some system of naming the male and female parent that is not recon- structable from present day evidence. For PEPn, PCEPn, and PMq, we for- mally reconstruct *matua-(MASC. MODIFIER) 'father' and *matua-(FEM. MODI- FIER) 'mother'. Possibly they were **matu?a ta(?)ane and **matu7a fafine in PEPn, but there is no external evidence for those exact reconstructions,28 and they would be by analogy rather than direct cognation. When modern *matua forms mean 'parent', they are usually specified to have the more general sense, in the extreme, of '(all) people of the parental generation' and we can assign this sense to the protolanguage reconstructions. In the narrow sense, it meant 'biological parent', but in modern usages, modi- fiers are often mentioned in the sources that single out the biological parents, 'true mother', and so forth, while the unmodified term might mean 'people of the next elder generation', depending upon context. 2.2.2 PPn *tama(na) 'father' and *tina(na) 'mother'. PPn *tama(na) '(human) father' and *tina(na) '(human) mother' are reconstructed on the basis of agree- ments of Western29 and Outlier Polynesian languages with external evidence (see Tables 14 and I5). PNPn *tamana is not known from Eastern Polynesia, and *tinana there refers only to mothers of broods and the female parent of animals. Reconstruction of PPn **tamana 'father' and **tinana 'mother' would be based on the assumption that POc *tama and *tina were continued into PPn, and that *-na was added to these and other kin terms during the Pre-PPn period. As Tongan has tamai3" and Niuean matua taane31 'father', Biggs (1994) recon- structs *tamana only to Proto-Samoic-Outlier,32 because it is not found in TO or EPn. Biggs's PNPn *tinana 'mother' is supported by evidence from non- Ellicean Outliers, Ellicean Outliers, East Futunan, and EP.

We now move on to the question of the degree to which terms for biological parents were extended to collaterals, especially the parents' true siblings. Kuroiwa (1975) treated terms for the collaterals in considerable detail. The comparisons and reconstructions in Table I6 are based on his study, the evidence being expanded from Biggs (1994) and the kinship database. The evidence for PPn *tu?a-tina comes from Western Polynesia, non- Ellicean Outliers, and Tuvalu/Tokelau, but not from the other Ellicean Outliers or Eastern Polynesia.

Aside from the distribu- tional evidence for this term existing in PPn, the use of *tina rather than *tinana suggests some antiquity within Polynesian, for it was Pre-Polynesian *tina and not the possible Proto-Polynesian *tina(na) or the more certain Proto-Nuclear Polynesian *tinana that was used in the form. Kuroiwa (I975) and Biggs (1994) reconstruct PPn *tu?aa-tina (with a long second vowel). Some vowels, but especially the "a" vowel, are susceptible to lengthening in that position in most Polynesian languages (the "antepen- ultimate" position) (Marck n.d.c). I believe the better reconstruction is with a short vowel for this word, because only a few NPn languages show length with any certainty. 2.2.4 Pn **masaki-taija 'father's sister'. In Table 17, Tikopian follows the East Uvean pattern of irregular vowel change in the second syllable, and the word may be a borrowing from that language. There is also West Futunan maha-vae 'father's sister', but this seems to be based upon different roots,34 as is Tokelauan maatua haa 'father's sister', the first word meaning 'parent' and the second 'sacred'. The latter is said by Macgregor (1937:45-47) to refer spe- cifically to the father's eldest sister. Samoa also has a word for this relative in all the sources, ilamutu 'father's sister', but Samoans interviewed in Canberra in 1995 think of this specifically in relation to the senior female line of a title, and not in reference to such relatives in general. The Samoan word is a reten- tion, with semantic change, from PPn *?ilamutu 'man's sister's child'. There is, therefore, only troubled evidence for reconstructing *masaki-trja 'father's sister' to PPn. It is found in (I) Tongic, (2) East Futunan, (3) East Uvean along with Anutan and Tikopian (with Tikopian showing an otherwise uniquely TABLE 17.

Thus it counts something like a non-Ellicean Outlier: a language whose divergence seems to be early. Puk specifically has not bor- rowed from TO, so far as is presently known. (Thus it contrasts with Euv, Anu, and Tik, which can be shown to have borrowings from TO.) 6Borrowing from Euv suggested on basis of second vowel. 2i6</page><page sequence="23">KIN TERMS IN THE POLYNESIAN PROTOLANGUAGES East Uvean vowel development and Anutan having lost the syllable con- cerned),35 and (4) Pukapukan. The non-Ellicean Outlier evidence involves only two languages, which may have borrowed the word from East Uvean. There are no Eastern Polynesian or Ellicean agreements of any kind, and Rennellese, which is commonly conservative in kin terms, is not known to have the term. While East Uvean has borrowed extensively from Tongan language and culture, East Futunan has done so only marginally.36 Pukapukan is an unclassified Nuclear Polynesian language, so the term's occurrence there is seen as evidence of the situation in PNPn, but not in PEc. Given the Pukapukan cognate, we seem to be dealing with an ancient vocabulary item. Thus, the term is reconstructed to PNPn and PPn pro- visionally. We hold open the possibility that revision would be necessary if there came to be reason to suspect that Pukapukan has borrowed from Tongan, East Uvean, or East Futunan, something that we presently have no reason to suspect. The reconstruction to PTo, on the other hand, seems quite secure. The word is dis- cussed in i., and seems composed of *masaki 'sick' and *-Cara 'NOMINALIZER'. It may seem odd to linguists that there may have been no term for 'father's sister' in some Pn protolanguages, when there was so clearly a term for 'mother's brother', but this is the situation in several of the modern languages, and I am informed (J. Fox, pers. comm.) that such asymmetry (my usage, not Fox's) is common in kin terms in Austronesian. There seems to be little special content in the relationship with the father's sister compared to that of the rela- tionship with the mother's brother in many of the modern societies. We can also note that there was a reciprocal term in the instance of 'mother's brother', that is, a term for 'man's sister's child', while there is no evidence of a special term for 'woman's brother's child' for any of the protolanguages.37 2.2.5 Discussion. These are the limits of the reconstructable terms for con- sanguines of the parents' generation at the PPn level (*matua 'parent', *maatua 'parents', *tama(na) 'father', *tina(na) 'mother', *tu?a-tina 'mother's brother' and the less certain **masaki-tara 'father's sister'). Proto-Nuclear Polynesian seems to have retained this same set of distinctions. There is no evidence in Ellicean for *masaki-tara 'father's sister'. Lack of retention of the *masaki-taiJa form for 'father's sister' is curious in Samoan and Tokelauan, where the father's eldest sister has special cursing power that is suggestive of the meaning of the reconstructed word. So either this power survived without the old term for the person wielding it, or the behavior is an areal phenomenon in the Tonga-to-Samoa area post-dating PPn, PNPn, PEc, and PEcO, with local terms for the relationship being adopted. Either way, the Pukapukan evidence is striking, because it does not otherwise share any of the nongenerational kin terms. The PPn 'mother's brother' term (*tu?a-tina) is not known from Outlier Ellicean (except Tuvalu and Tokelau), while it was retained in the non-Ellicean Outliers, and Western Polynesia other than Samoa. Eastern Polynesia not only lost the term for 'mother's brother' and the possible early term for 'father's sister', but 217</page><page sequence="24">OCEANIC LINGUISTICS, VOL. 35, NO. 2 also the PPn terms for 'mother' and 'father', replacing the latter with 'female par- ent' and 'male parent' constructions, respectively. Where there are no special terms for 'father's sister' and 'mother's brother', such seem universally to be called respectively 'mother' and 'father' (along with the mother's sister and father's brother), and there are no special modifiers reconstructable to PPn to distinguish a maternal aunt from the mother, or a pater- nal uncle from the father. Most commonly, special modifiers are used to distin- guish the "true" mother or father. The sources for Western Polynesia and the Out- liers consistently specify, for instance, 'mother, mother's sister' for the 'mother' term when there is a separate term for 'father's sister', and they specify 'mother, mother's sister, father's sister' for the 'mother' term when there is no separate 'father's sister' term. 'Mother's brother' is given among the 'father' meanings in every instance where there is no special 'mother's brother' term. Similarly, the Eastern Polynesian languages indicate that the 'mother' and 'father' terms are generational and apply to all people of that sex and generation as a whole. There are no exceptions in the Outliers, Western Polynesia, and Eastern Polynesia. The sources, as a group, no matter how cryptically, name all the parents and parents' siblings with specific terms, and in no case are we left to wonder. 2.3 CONSANGUINES OF EGO'S OWN GENERATION (+0). "Few Polynesian societies seem to have a general term equivalent to 'sibling' without further specification" (Firth 1970:273). Clark (I975) reconstructed PPn *tuakana 'elder same-sex sibling', *tahina 'younger same-sex sibling', *tua-r)a?ane 'woman' s brother' and *tua-fafine 'man's sister'. Here we reconstruct PPn *ta?o- kete 'same-sex sibling' and *kawe 'cross-sex sibling'. It is clear that all (first) cousins were named in the same manner as siblings in all the Pn protolanguages under consideration here. Where special 'cousin' terms developed (always in the context of groups that permit cross-cousin mar- riage), the terms are idiosyncratic local developments. The only exceptions are where *fai- or *faka- are sometimes prefixed to the sibling terms to render 'cousin'. Even in those societies that had terminological distinctions for some or all siblings' children versus one's own children, the children themselves re- ferred to each other with the (own) sibling terms. Sibling terms have received considerable attention for Polynesian and Oce- anic as a whole. Papers by Epling, Kirk, and Boyd (I973) and Marshall (1984) allowed reconstruction based upon typological observations to run counter to reconstruction based on standard linguistic methods (especially those based upon shared retentions and shared innovations), and their suggestions about prehistoric systems were soon dismissed (Clark I975; and Bender I984, Blust I984, Chowning 1984, Clark 1984, respectively). Epling, Kirk, and Boyd's (1973) work was part of a broader interest in Polynesian taxonomy and lexicostatistics (Kirk and Epling 1972, I973). In the other works, something resembling lexicostatistics was involved to produce taxonomies of Pn languages. 2I8</page><page sequence="25">KIN TERMS IN THE POLYNESIAN PROTOLANGUAGES Solutions at variance with the linguistic reconstructions are not necessarily doomed but, as Blust (1984:626) notes, the anthropologists have tended to view various kinds of typological change as equally "costly," and have not taken full stock of how "costly" typological solutions become when they re- sult in having multiple (sometimes dozens of) languages all having to make the same typological changes with identical terminological results. This is not to imply that only one linguistic interpretation is possible in every instance, but sibling term reconstructions for POc and PPn have not been problematic or controversial within linguistics. As Polynesian kinship terms for ascending and descending generations are mostly generational, I have not employed the tree diagrams common for kin- ship discussions in those sections. In the case of Oceanic sibling terms, it is generally not the practice to use such diagrams, for the situation is complicated by differences between terms employed by male and female speakers and dif- ferences in terms employed for older and younger same-sex siblings. Instead, a different kind of illustration is employed that captures the same-sex/cross-sex distinctions and the age distinctions. The diagram for the most common Polynesian system is as shown in Figure 3 (after Epling, Kirk, and Boyd 1973, Clark 1975, Marshall 1984). It is intended to show that a system has terminological distinctions between elder "e" and younger "y" same-sex (or parallel) "//" siblings, and special terms for the cross-sex "x" sibling of a female (woman's brother) "m" and male (man's sister) "f." This is the system in the great majority of historic Polynesian societies. Samoan, Pukapukan, East Futunan, and the Outliers (including Tuvalu and Tokelau, but not Rennell, Bellona, and Taumako) are among the exceptions, and have simpler systems that are diagrammed in Figures 4, 5, and 6, based on Clark (I975:87). The evidence for the reconstructions for consanguines of ego's generation is discussed in the subsections that follow. PPn *tuakana and *ta?o-kete are dis- cussed last, because the latter presents special problems and, at first glance, would seem to have had the same meaning as the former ('elder same-sex sibling'). 2.3.1 PPn *tua-fafine 'man's sister' and *tua-ja?ane 'woman's brother'. The evidence for PPn *tua-fafine 'man's sister' can be seen in Table i8. The change in the second morpheme from PEc *tua-fafine to PEPn *tua-hine may be viewed as a replacement rather than a reduction. PPn &gt; PNPn &gt; PEc *-fine &gt; PEPn *-hine 'feminine suffix' is reconstructed (Biggs 1994) and is possibly the source of the change (rather than a reduction of PPn *fafine 'woman'). The PPn form regularly continues POc *papine 'man's sister' (cf. Chowning I99g:66,38 Pawley I98I:284) with the addition of *tua-. Biggs (1994) attributes the origin of the PPn *tua- prefix to POc *tuRai 'companion', giving Chowning (1991:69) as his source for POc, and Geraghty (1990:76) as his source for PEO.39 Geraghty (I990) notes evidence for the reconstruction of PEO *tuRa 'same-sex 219</page><page sequence="26">OCEANIC LINGUISTICS, VOL. 35, NO. 2 sibling', and Chowning (1991) considers some of its possible uses as akin term in POc, referring to Grace (1979) as the original source of the reconstruction with the meaning 'companion' .PPn *tua-fafine seems to have meant 'man's sister', and the word for 'woman's brother' developed out of POc in a similar way (see Table I9).

In the present work I accept those Rapanui terms as native to that lan- guage. Rapanui kin terms follow a pattern distinct from Tahitian in those instances where it is possible to evaluate the possibility of borrowings. //e l/y 220</page><page sequence="27">KIN TERMS IN THE POLYNESIAN PROTOLANGUAGES PPn *-qa?ane was retained from a POc word of the same meaning ('woman's brother'), which is reconstructed as *maRu?ane or *mwa?ane by Blust and Pawley, respectively, as cited in Chowning (199 1:66). There is a general sporadic tendency in Polynesian languages for the second vowel of the sibling prefix *tua- to be lost. That vowel would always have been unstressed, and independent loss can be observed from this and other kin terms. (Compare this with what is clearly a historic loss involving several such words in Rennellese in the kinship database.) Reflexes of PPn *tua-rja?ane 'woman's brother' occur in more languages than reflexes of PPn *tua-fafine 'man's sister', but have changed meaning more often-always to 'cross-sex sibling (xm&amp;f)'. When a language eliminates the 'man's sister'/'woman's brother' distinction and goes to a single 'cross-sex sib- ling' term, it often employs the old 'woman's brother' term (Clark 1975:86), but never the 'man's sister' term. As noted below, this is what happened in the early Fijian system. Alternately, some NPn languages lose both gendered terms and retain PNPn *kave 'cross-sex sibling' (Table 21). 2.3.2 PPn *tahina 'younger same-sex sibling'. PPn *tahina 'younger same- sex sibling' (Table 20) can be observed to be widely reflected, and we can note that it is one of the most stable sibling terms in Oceanic, reconstructing to POc *taci4O '//y'. There are several notable developments within the correspondences. TABLE 18.

The second is the Luangiua (Oja) form, which seems to have PPn *h as a sporadic retention. Possibly this is a borrowing from nearby Melanesian languages, because neither Sikaiana nor Takuu, close rela- tives of Luangiua, nor any other NPn language retains the sound. Alternately it could be a sporadic retention in a situation where NPn languages retained PPn *h longer than we generally imagine, and lost it severally, rather than as a whole at an early time.41 A noteworthy characteristic of these correspondences is the change of the first vowel to e (reflecting *teina) in every Eastern Polynesian language except those at the margins: Rapanui (Eas), Hawaiian, and a regional dialect of N.Z. Maori. This may be testimony to the degree of linguistic interaction in the Central Eastern Polynesian heartland after the divergence of other languages to the margins. It is especially striking that every known Tahitic language and dialect, except for the eastern N.Z. Maori dialect chain, has made this assimila- tion. On the other hand, something often happens to the first vowel of similar trisyllabic words (where there is a low first vowel and a high second vowel), such as the change of PPn *fanua 'land, placenta' to (f,h)enua, the change of PPn *matu?a to metu(')a, and the general tendency of the low vowel to raise in the *(#,-)ai(#,-) diphthongs. Still, the first vowel in the majority of similar forms neither assimilates nor lengthens in PEPn, PCEPn, PMq,42 or PTa, and it is a singular phenomenon to have the ancient pronunciation so well preserved on the margins, and so thoroughly replaced in the middle. It is consistent with a profound areal effect from Tahiti but, as mentioned, may simply have to do with the phonetics of the word. TABLE 20.

The evidence in Table 21 is from Biggs (1994) in the case of most Outliers, from my own search of the sources in the case of Taumako and EPn, and Melenaite Taumoefolau by way of P. Geraghty (pers. comm.) in the case of Ton. Biggs also notes the resemblance to Moala (Fijian) weka 'sibling of the opposite sex'. Elsewhere, Geraghty (I983:375) makes a Fijian reconstruction of the form *weka 'opposite sex sibling', mentioning evidence from Kadavu, the Lau islands of Fiji, and southeastern Viti Levu, and noting the similarity to PNPn *kawe. Abundant evidence for Geraghty's recon- struction can be seen in Nayacakalou (I971). Either Fijian *weka or Pn *kawe metathesized, but the words are clearly cog- nate. The PPn *kawe word seems to have been lost or to have lost the 'cross-sex' meaning in all languages that retain distinct terms for the male versus the female cross-sex sibling, other than in Taumako, where it names same-sex cross-cousins. It seems that PPn had words for cross-sex siblings in general, the male cross-sex sibling, and the female cross-sex sibling, but this terminological situation may have been inherently unstable, a little redundant perhaps. Similarly, no example comes to mind of a contemporary Polynesian language that has a term for 'same- sex' sibling and also distinguishes same-sex siblings by relative age. 2.3.4 Older same-sex sibling: *tuaka(na) or *ta?o-kete? We now consider what word or words may have meant 'older same-sex sibling' in PPn. There are two candidates: *tuaka(na) and *ta?o-kete. The first seems quite clearly to have meant 'older same-sex sibling' in PPn, on the basis of NPn agreements with external evidence. The second seems also to have that meaning in PPn, based upon agreement of Tongic, languages that have borrowed from Tongic, and Rennellese-although the Rennellese could have been a convergent indepen- dent development. Otherwise, modern *ta?o-kete forms mean either 'same-sex sibling' (Ece, Efu) or 'same-sex sibling-in-law' (PEPn and its daughters). We consider the evidence for the two forms in turn. The internal evidence for PPn *tuaka(na) 'elder same-sex sibling' in Table 22 comes from Eastern Polynesia, Samoan, and the Outlier Taumako. There are abundant external cognates with the same meaning. TABLE 21. PPn *kawe 'CROSS-SEX SIBLING' Lau-Fij *weka 'cross-sex sibling'.

The word goes back fur- ther in Oceanic with the same meaning. Because the *tua- of PPn *tuaka(na) is from the base of the historical root, I have not parsed it as I do the others. Biggs (1994), however, does so in his PPn *tua-kana 'elder same-sex sibling' recon- struction, possibly under the assumption that PPn *tua-fafine 'man's sister' and *tua-ja?ane 'woman's brother' would have resulted in a situation where the dif- ferent historical origins would not have been obvious, and *tuaka(na) would have been reinterpreted as *tua-ka(na). We can also suggest that pre-PPn *tuakana may have been reinterpreted as *tua-kana and may have become the model for *tua- rja?ane and *tua-fafine. Taken together, certain Western Polynesian45 and non-Ellicean Outlier evi- dence implies PPn **ta?o-kete 'elder same-sex sibling', a meaning that Biggs (1994) has attributed to both his PPn *tua-kana reconstruction on the basis of the EPn-Fij agreement, and to his PPn *ta?o-kete reconstruction on the basis of Tongic agreements with East Uvean and Rennellese. In Eastern Polynesia, *ta?o-kete reflexes always refer to same-sex siblings-in-law or siblings-in-law in general. Clark (1975:86) dealt with the situation by appealing to the agreement of external evidence with EPn and reconstructing PPn *tuakana with the 'elder same-sex sibling' meaning. Kuroiwa (1975) wondered if there was a dif- ference in PPn, where *tuaka(na) referred to such things as primogeniture and socio-political rank, and *ta?o-kete referred simply to relative age of sib- lings. He posited a diminution in the extreme respect behavior between same- sex siblings-in-law to have occurred between the Proto-Polynesian community and the Proto-Eastern Polynesian community. His solution was to say that PEPn speakers had come to employ the old PPn term for primogeniture, *tuaka(na), which fell out of use in Western Polynesia and the Outliers.46 TABLE 22.

There is no direct evidence that the former carried a primogeniture sense, and little that the later carried the relative age sense. Also, this is contrary to the agreement of PEPn and Taumako with external evidence on the meaning of PPn *tuaka(na) as 'elder same-sex sibling'. We can reexamine the non-EPn evidence in Biggs (I994) concerning *ta?o- kete by reference to Table 23. I1 found no further cognates in Outlier languages or Samoan. The 'elder same-sex sibling' sense is limited to Tongic (Tongan and Niuean), plus East Uvean (which has borrowed a great deal from Tongan) and Rennellese. Therefore, there are only two clearly independent witnesses to the 'el- der' meaning. Reflexes of *ta?o-kete are said to simply mean 'same-sex' sibling in East Futunan and Tuvalu (Ece). Other sources suggest that either the form is specifically masculine in East Futunan, or concerns the firstborn, or both. Burrows (1936) has it meaning 'firstborn brother', Rensch (1984) has it meaning 'premier- ne de la parente, aine (first bom of the parents, eldest)', and Moyse-Faurie (I993) has it meaning 'frere aine; aine des garqons (eldest brother, eldest of boys)'. The core East Futunan sibling terms distinguish only sex and not age (Burrows 1936; Epling, Kirk, and Boyd 1973; Clark 1975) and the terms used aretaina 'same-sex' and tua-nga'ane 'cross-sex sibling'. Biggs (1994) seems to list himself as the source for his East Futunan data, but ta'o-kete otherwise seems to be a primogeni- ture term, and the usage he lists may be a recent development. The takete 'same- sex sibling' of Nanumea (Tuvalu [Ece]) most likely comes from *ta?o-kete. Proto-Polynesian seems to have been a language with dialects in the north that gave rise to the modern Nuclear Polynesian languages, and dialects in the south that gave rise to the Tongic languages. Whether social organization was continuous or discontinuous is a matter for investigation. We should not as- sume identity in the social systems of the dialect regions just because there seem to have been mutually intelligible dialects for a long period of time. I see no merit in proposing a single narrow solution for the semantic recon- struction of PPn *ta?o-kete, when the evidence today is so ambiguous. As we will TABLE 23.

All the options leave us with an Epling, Kirk, and Boyd (I973) "Type 20" PPn sibling system: one in which reference was to same-sex siblings by relative age and to cross-sex siblings by special terms for male and female. As Kuroiwa (I975) and Clark (I975) have noted, the main trend in Polynesian kinship terminologies has been toward simplification, and this generally occurred in the Outliers and, for some reason, Samoa. 2.3.5 The extension of sibling terms to cousins. We will now consider how sibling terms are extended to cousins, and the case for differential cross- and parallel-cousin terminologies in the protolanguages. It is most convenient to do so by first considering the situation in Central Eastern Polynesian, where there is little variation. Reference to Rapanui is not made here, because the sources I have seen do not speak narrowly to these issues. In Central Eastern Polynesian languages, we observe that there is always wholesale application of the sibling terms to all first cousins. Most notably, even in the case of Marquesan, a society with clear preferences for cross-cousin marriage, there were no differences in the naming of cross- and parallel-cousins, and all were named as siblings (Handy 1923:68-69). The Tongic evidence (Gifford 1929:28-29) agrees with Central Eastern Polynesian concerning the application of the sibling terms equally to cross- and parallel-cousins. Cross-cousin marriage occurred in Tonga, but was not formally preferential. Special family councils met to consider such unions and 'a man and a woman who could not come into close proximity to each other by their own initiative may be married by the will of those who have the ordering of them" (Gifford 1929:22). Niuean sources (Loeb 1926:62) state specifically that both cross- and parallel-cousins are named with the sibling terms. East Uvean (Burrows 1937:62-66) has a special affix for first cousins and another for more distant cousins. These have not been found to be cognate with other such Pn affixes. Otherwise, the terms for cross-cousins are the same as the terms for parallel-cousins, and these are the sibling terms. Burrows (1937:62) was not able to suggest what the traditional rules of marriage may have been, due to generations of missionary influence. East Futunan (Burrows I936:73-76) applies sibling terms to "all recognized relatives of the same generation," and there is no indication that cross- or parallel-cousins have spe- cial terms. As with East Uvean, Burrows (I936:7 I1) comments that missionary influence made traditional marriage patterns difficult to sort out. For neither East Uvea or East Futuna, then, are there differences in naming cross- and par- allel-cousins, nor is there the suggestion that cross-cousin marriage was prac- ticed, or that it was not. 226</page><page sequence="33">KIN TERMS IN THE POLYNESIAN PROTOLANGUAGES The non-Ellicean Outliers have a number of distinct systems, and generali- zation is difficult. Rennellese (Birket-Smith 1956:I 3) named parallel cousins as siblings but called cross-sex cross-cousins ha'anga, a term I have found in no other Pn language with a related meaning, except in neighboring Bellona. Cross-cousin marriage is practiced and common on Rennell (Birket-Smith I956:112). Bellona also practices cross-cousin marriage, but "according to Bellonese traditions, marriages of cross-cousins were taboo until about i i generations ago when the population of Bellona thinned out due to excessive interlineage fighting, and intermarriage of closer kinsmen became necessary for the further survival of the population. Cross-cousins who were previously labelled tu-hahine 'real or classificatory sisters' were now labelled ha'anga and thus became marriageable" (Monberg 1976:249). Terms for parallel-cousins in West Futuna-Aniwa are said by the sources (kinship database) to be the same as the sibling terms. In the case of the cross- cousins, cross-nephews/nieces, and cross-aunts/uncles, the whole terminologi- cal system seems transformed toward the equivalence of consanguinal and af- final relatives, where cross-cousin marriage makes them the same. That is, the term for 'man's sister's son' is extended to 'son-in-law'. The extensions run straight through the system, but do not have the affinal sense elsewhere, and therefore appear to be local developments. Tikopian distinguishes parallel- and cross-cousins with compounds of the basic sibling terms, as in Table 24. "Marriage with cross-cousins is not com- mon in Tikopia and is not favored, being placed on exactly the same footing as the union of parallel cousins" (Firth I963:208-209). Anutan resembles Tikopian in a number of ways, but no terminological dis- tinction is given in the sources for cross-cousins versus parallel-cousins. All are said to be named according to the sibling terms: kave 'cross-sex sibling' and taina 'same-sex sibling'. Feinberg (I979:328) would seem to imply that cross- cousin marriage is not practiced, but does not say so directly. The survey of non-Ellicean Outlier terminological systems gave much the same result as for CEPn, TO, Euv, and Efu: there are no cognate terms distinguish- ing cross- from parallel-cousins, or (first) cousins of any kind from siblings,47 and we are left with the notion that their common ancestral language named cousins in the same manner as siblings.48 Terms for cousins in Pukapuka are quite unique and seem to alternate be- tween generations (Beaglehole and Beaglehole 1938:259-263), but make no TABLE 24.

Marriage between (first) cousins is prohibited, whether cross- or parallel-cousins (Beaglehole and Beaglehole I938:260). Samoa and the Ellicean Outliers seem to have no reconstructable system. Samoan sibling terms are applied to cousins (Mead 1930:126-I46), and no terminological distinction is mentioned for cross- and parallel-cousins. Nei- ther Mead nor other sources mention cross-cousin marriage; Shore (I976:276) says specifically that sibling incest rules cover all cousins as well. Kennedy (I931), who worked on Vaitupu in Tuvalu, is quite specific that same-sex and cross-sex parallel- and cross-cousins are all called by the sibling terms, taina 'same-sex sibling' and tua-ngane 'cross-sex sibling'. He mentions two special terms, taina-sala 'father' s brother' s same-sex child' and tua-ngane- sala 'father's brother's cross-sex child', but cognates were not found in other Pn languages. Ranby (I980) does not specify cousin terms for Nanumea. Table 25 gives some distinctive terms for cross-sex parallel- and cross-cousins for Tokelauan. The *faka- prefix to kin terms occurs in other Pn languages and generally involves the extension of a basic term to a broader category of people (with a sense of 'in the manner of, as if [but not the real thing]'), but I know of no exact cognates for the particular constructions above. Similarly, *fai- is a re- lationship prefix in other languages (e.g., Oja, Ren hai- 'relational prefix', Sam fai- 'fostered or adopted'), but there I find (kinship database) no cognates of the forms in Table 25. Macgregor (1937) recorded a different set of terms at an earlier time for Tokelau (and possibly on a different island: tainafetau taina 'cross-sex parallel cousins on the father's side' and tuafafine fetau taina 'cross-sex parallel cousins on the mother's side'. Those terms seem to have no external cognates. Marriage to first or second cousins in the late I96os was proscribed (Huntsman 1971:328), and no distinction seems to be made between cross- and parallel-cous- ins in this regard. Whether this characterized the traditional system is not easily recoverable, due to long missionary influence and lack of ethnographic work until recent decades. Luangiua (Ontong Java) has only two sibling terms, 'ave 'cross-sex sibling' and kainga 'same-sex sibling' (from PEc *kave and *taina), and these are ex- tended to both cross- and parallel-cousins. Marriage between these classifica- tory siblings is said to be prohibited (Hogbin 193 I a). Kapingamarangi (Emory TABLE 25. TERMS FOR CROSS-SEX PARALLEL AND CROSS-COUSINS IN TOKELAUAN faka-tua-fafine 'female parallel first cousin (of male)' fai-tua-fafine 'female cross first cousin (of male)' faka-tua-gane 'male parallel first cousin (of female)' fai-tua-gane 'male cross first cousin (of female)' SOURCE: Huntsman (1971:337) 228</page><page sequence="35">KIN TERMS IN THE POLYNESIAN PROTOLANGUAGES 1965:111-118) has lost all distinctions of age and sex in kin terms, and has a single term, tua-hin(a), which designates all siblings and (first) cousins. Emory (1965:170) states that it was "considered tabu to have intercourse with a rela- tive nearer than a third cousin," and this is also the rule for marriage (Elbert 1965:173). This may have been the traditional rule, for Christianity did not come to Kapingamarangi until after about I9IO, and Elbert took pains to learn as much about the pre-Christian period as possible, including documenting histories of polygyny and polyandry.49 It seems there was a pre-Christian notion that off- spring of close relatives would not be normal (Elbert I965:I73). Our purpose here has been to investigate patterns of naming cousins, and it seems clear that, in contrast to the situation in most of Fiji, PPn and all the later interstages had no terms for cross- or parallel-cousins distinct from the sibling terms themselves. We cannot presently reconstruct systems of affixing sibling terms to specify either true siblings or cousins to any of the Poly- nesian protolanguages. This is not to say that they did not exist in some or all of the protolanguages, although one is left with that impression on the basis of current data. Rather it may be that such systems were not stable over time when they occurred. There is the impression that cross-cousin marriage was and is practiced in few Polynesian societies. Where it occurs, there is the appearance that the terminolo- gies have arisen independently. While this impression may be due to Christian missionary influence, the common absence of cousin terms, especially cross- cousin terms, is intriguing, because the end of cross-cousin marriage would not necessarily result in the abandonment of cross-cousin terminologies.50 Or if there were no special terms, we would still expect some confusion in the daughter languages as to whether a term named affines or consanguines. Yet we find no reconstructable cousin terms of any kind, and affinal and consanguinal terms are not confused or merged. The prehistory of sibling terms in Polynesia thus seems to have been one of the "Hawaiian" type (where all cousins were called 'sibling') and all Pn lan- guages that show divergence from this pattern seem to have done so individu- ally. We must admit an absence of relevant materials and data in the case of some non-Ellicean and many Ellicean Outliers, so there may be some low-level agreements in the naming of cousins that are presently unknown. But the over- all evidence points without exception to a Hawaiian pattern for PPn, PTo, PNPn, PEc, PEPn, PCEPn, PMq, and PTa. In the Marquesas, this very sibling terminology type does occur with pref- erential cross-cousin marriage,51 in contrast to the many Polynesian localities where it does not. So Polynesian evidence provides at least one case of a termi- nological system that does not have a term for cousin or cross-cousin occurring in the context of a society with preferential cross-cousin marriage. Adequate description sometimes reveals an equivalence of 'spouse' and 'cross-sex cross-cousin' when there is commonly cross-cousin marriage (e.g., 229</page><page sequence="36">OCEANIC LINGUISTICS, VOL. 35, NO. 2 Hocart [1929] for Lau Fijian and Dougherty [I1983:636] for West Futunan). But the terminological equivalence of 'spouse' and 'cross-sex cross-cousin' is not universal in Fiji (e.g., Pawley [n.d.] for Wayan Fijian), nor is it apparently com- mon in Fijian (see Capell and Lester I945). I know of no PFj, PCP, or POc re- constructions in which there is an equivalence (cf. Chowning's [i991] recent work on POc). I do not want to be responsible for some misunderstanding as to the strength of the evidence for saying cross-cousin marriage may not have been practiced in PPn times. Such evidence does not come from the failure of the languages to show reconstructable cousin or cross-cousin terms, nor does it come from the status of cousins or cross-cousins as classificatory siblings. Both of these fea- tures are present in some of the Polynesian societies that are known to have practiced cross-cousin marriage.52 There are gradations in the societies con- cerned: West Futunan names the spouse with the same term as cross-sex cross- cousins (and the term is not known from elsewhere), Rennellese has a special term for cross-sex cross-cousins (and the term is not known from elsewhere) that was different from the words for spouse, husband, or wife. Marquesan, like most other Pn languages, had no special term for cross-cousins. Tongan is like Marquesan in having cross-cousin marriage but no special terms for cross or other cousins. It is necessary to be careful about mentioning these two societies in the same breath, for the Marquesas had preferential cross-cousin marriage, whereas on Tonga it was a prerogative of a couple's parents to arrange such a marriage, but it was not a prerogative of cross-cousins to ask for one or to oth- erwise develop a romantic interest. 2.4 CONSANGUINES OF THE CHILDREN'S GENERATION (+1). Be- cause there are so many reconstructed terms in this section, I give their distri- butions in the protolanguages in Table 26. The generational patterning of PPn kin terms applied to consanguines of one's child's generation, all one's sibling's children being one's classificatory children, with the exception of a man's sister's children (PPn *?ilamutu) but probably not a woman's brother's children (PPn **faka-fotu). The evidence for the special 'man's sister's child' term is quite compelling (Kuroiwa 1975, Biggs 1994) and is expanded here. The evidence for the special 'woman's brother's child' term is limited to Tongan, East Uvean, and East Futunan, and may be a later development in those languages, rather than a PPn characteristic. The PPn form for 'man's sister's child', *?ilaamutu, persisted into PTo, PNPn, PEc, PEPn, PCEPn, PMq, and PTa. It was lost only in some Outliers. The mean- ing may have been somewhat different in some of the EPn protolanguages. It was generalized to include all a person's cross-sex sibling's children in at least one in- stance (Marquesan), and meant any nephew or niece in Mangarevan and N.Z. Maori (but had a sense of 'esp. sister's children' in N.Z. Maori). In Samoan it came to refer to the father's sister rather than a man's sister's child. 230</page><page sequence="37">KIN TERMS IN THE POLYNESIAN PROTOLANGUAGES There were also terms for a son when a man was speaking or being referred to, as opposed to when a woman was speaking or being referred to. PPn *tama referred to the son of a woman or couple, while PPn **fosa seems to have referred to the son of a man. Daughters may not have had distinct terms of reference according to parent, apparently being called PPn *tama-?a-fine by both parents. The distinction of 'man's son' versus 'woman's son' has generally been lost, except in Western Polynesia, Tokelau, and a few of the non-Ellicean Outliers. It is entirely lacking in EPn and the few Ellicean Outliers (other than Tokelau) for which there are data. The Sam/Tok term for 'man's son' (*ata-liki) is distinct from that used in Ton, Euv, Efu, Ren, Anu, and Tik (*fosa), but because the Sam/Tok term agrees in form and meaning with Wfu, it may also be quite ancient. 2.4.1 Lineals. As can be seen in Table 27, there is abundant evidence for PPn, PTo, PNPn, and PEc *tama referring to the children or sons of women or couples. It paired with a male-oriented counterpart for each of these protolanguages (*fosa or *ata-liki). This contrast seems entirely absent in Eastern Polynesian languages. TABLE 26.

We dis- cuss *?ilamutu presently. The point for the moment is that all sibling's children in all Polynesian protolanguages seem to have been called by the 'own child' terms, with the exception of those sibling's children named with PPn *?ilamutu reflexes (but see **faka-fotu 'woman's brother's child' in Table 36 below). The forms reconstructed in Tables 28 and 29 show a distribution whereby Tongan, East Futunan, East Uvean, Rennellese, Anutan, and Tikopian appear to retain a PPn form, while PEc has innovated and some non-Ellicean Outliers share the PEc innovation. Such a distribution is not strictly consistent with present subgrouping hypotheses and suggests borrowing around both Western Polynesia and the non-Ellicean Outliers after PPn and PNPn times. From the agreement of Tongan and Rennellese in Table 28 we can suggest that PPn **fosa meant 'man's son'. The agreement of Tongan, East Uvean, TABLE 27.

Possibly there were two words for 'man's son' in PNPn, but it seems more a case of the kind of distribution that has long plagued attempts at subgrouping the Outliers, especially the non-Ellicean Outliers. Such distributions seem to occur due to multiple cultural inputs (mixing of vocabulary between groups of people who had distinct, but [easily] mutually intelligible dialects). It is possible to explain the distributions by positing independent development, with *fosa, *ata-liki, or both coming into use independently in two or more locali- ties-especially *ata-liki, which is morphologically complex. The *ata- or *ta- prefix is found in many words having to do with people and relationships (see R. Clark, pers. comm. to Biggs [I994, noted in the *ata-liki reconstructions]). Possi- bly its use with PNPn *-liki arose independently in various locations. The 'firstborn son' sense of *ata-riki reconstructed for PEPn seems quite secure. The term does not have that general meaning in TA, so that sense in Rapanui is probably the directly inherited meaning,53 and it agrees with Mangarevan and Marquesan. The reconstruction of the main 'girl' and 'daughter' words are made on the basis of the agreements in Tables 30 and 3 I1. The system for naming 'daughter' versus 'girl' and 'man's daughter' versus 'woman or couple's daughter' is not immediately clear for the PPn level. For 'girl' and 'daughter' terms in general, Biggs (I994) reconstructs the terms in Table 32. If we consider the distribution of these forms and their meanings, I believe a different interpretation is pos- sible, that shown in Table 33. TABLE 29. PNPn *ata-liki 'MAN'S SON OR CLASSIFICATORY SON' PNPn *ata-liki 'man's son or classificatory son' (R.

The only form with agreements that allow a precise reconstruction of both form and meaning to the PPn level is *tama-?a-fine. The semantics of the reflexes indicate that it meant 'daughter' in PPn. The bulk of the evidence for *ta?a-hine suggests a PPn meaning of 'girl'. East Uvean and East Futunan combine the 'girl' and 'daughter' meanings (and lose PPn *tama-?a-fine 'daughter'), while Tongan, Samoan, and Tokelauan have the (original) sense 'girl'. It is again curious that Rennellese agrees with a form found only in the PPn homeland area, with its *ta?a-hine reflex meaning 'daughter (honorific)'. There may have been a PPn woman's versus man's daughter distinction, but this could be a post-PPn development around Westem Polynesia. The reasons for believing in such a PPn distinction are rather more limited than those for believing that there was such a distinction for sons. The distinction between a 'man's daugh- ter' and 'woman or couple's daughter' is found mainly in Western Polynesia, but also in Taumako (Table 34). I have therefore reconstructed PPn **?o-fafine54 or **(?)a-fafine 'man's daughter'. I reconstruct the semantics of **tama-fafine '(**woman or) couple's daughter' provisionally in the case of the term referring primarily to the mother. These seem reasonable reconstructed distinctions, if not forms, on the basis of the Taumako agreement with the others, but it is best that core cul- TABLE 30.

We are left with the question of whether a language would distinguish 'man's son' and 'woman's son' but have no such distinction for daughters. In fact, this may be the situation in modern West Futunan, Mele-Fila, Rennellese, and East Uvean. 2.4.2 Collaterals. The reconstruction of the PPn 'man's sister's child' term is made on the basis of the agreements in Table 35. We might ask whether the term applied to children of all cross-sex siblings and whether it also meant 'child-in- law'. Clear answers are obtained in both instances. The term applied only to a man's sister's children, and it did not also refer to children-in-law. TABLE 33.

The occurrence of the 'man's sister's child' meaning in Tongic, and most of Nuclear Polynesian other than Eastern Poly- nesian, clearly points to this as the meaning in PPn. Only Marquesan applies the term to all cross-sex sibling's children, and only a few others apply the term to all children of all siblings (e.g., some Tahitic, and Mangarevan). West Futunan and Rennellese use their PPn *?ilaamutu reflexes to name chil- dren-in-law, but these seem local developments associated with their individual adoption of cross-cousin marriage. These appear to have occurred independently. A third clear example of a Pn society that practiced cross-cousin marriage is the Marquesas, but there i'amutu is not said to have the 'child-in-law' meaning. We cannot reconstruct with confidence a term for woman's brother' s child, because supporting evidence is limited to Tongan, East Uvean, and East Futunan (Table 36), which are adjacent and subject to borrowing from one an- other. Few languages have special terms for man's brother's child or woman's sister's child, and certainly these were referred to in PPn as one's own children. In PPn, parents' cross-sex siblings were specifically not terminologically merged with parents-in-law. Cross-sex cross-cousins (along with all other cousins) were terminologically merged with siblings, rather than spouses or potential spouses. Although there was a special term for a 'man's sister's child', this was not the same term as for '(man's) child-in-law'. What then was the PPn content of the relationship between a man's sister's children and a mother's brother, if it was not that of a potential child-in-law? This is discussed in Section I. Probably it did not have the specific content of the Tongan fahu (Table 37) institution, which agrees with Fijian rather than any other Polynesian (except for East Uvea and East Futuna) counterpart, and involves an extreme kind of license of the 'ilamutu toward the property of the mother's brother. Seemingly the PPn relationship entailed ritual rights and ob- ligations, as outlined by Kuroiwa (1975), and material support (as mentioned TABLE 35: PPN *?ilamutu 'MAN'S SISTER'S CHILD' PPn *?ilamutu 'man's sister's child', PTo *?ilamutu 'id.', Ton 'ilarnutu 'id.', PNPn *?ilaamutu 'id.', Anu iraamutu 'id.', Euv 'ilaamutu 'id.', Efu 'ilaamutu 'id.', Puk ilamutu 'child adopted by man from his sister', Ren 'igaamutu 'I. man's sister's child, 2. son-in-law, daughter-in-law', Tik iramutu, iraamutu 'id.', Wfu raimutu 'id.', PEc *?ilaamutu 'id.', Sam ilaamutu 'father's sister; descendants in female line', PEcO *?ilaamutu 'id.', Nan ilaamnutu 'mother's brother, sister's child', Oja ilaamoku 'sister's son'., Tak ilaamotu 'mother's brother, man's sister's child', Tok ilaamutu 'id.', Vai ilamutu 'id.', PEPn *(?)iraamutu 'indeterminate: either a man's sister's child or any person's cross-sex sibling's child', Eas iramutu 'neighbor, fellow being', PCEPn *iraamutu 'indeter- minate: either a man's sister's child or any person's cross-sex sibling's child', PMq *iraamutu 'in- determinate: either a man's sister's child or any person's, cross-sex sibling's child', Haw ilaamuku 'executive officer, marshal, sheriff', Mqa i'anutu 'child of cross-sex sibling or spouse's cross-sex sibling', Mva iramnutu 'nephew, niece', PTa *iraamutu 'indeterminate: either a man's sister's child or any person's sister's child', Mao iraamnutu 'nephew, niece, especially sister's' child'.

The *?ilamutu name and behaviors seem to have existed independently in numerous Polynesian societies for some two thousand years. This was in the absence of matrilineal groups or cross-cousin marriage, two institutions that give special significance to the relationship of a man's sister's child to its mother' s brother. Possibly the ritual relationship itself was the source of con- servatism, rather than some pressure in the social structure to focus on, name, and assign behaviors to that particular kin relationship. 2.4.3 Child, children, and boy. The reconstructed terms for 'child', 'children', and 'boy' are presented in Tables 38-40. They often became terms for 'progeny' and 'son'. See also PPn *ta?a-hine 'girl' (Table 3I) and *maa-fine 'daughter (**term of endearment)' (Table 41). As can be seen, the *tama-?iti term is widely used as a kin term in Tahitic, but not, apparently in N.Z. Maori. This would seem to be more evidence of widespread Tahitic sharings after the divergence of N.Z. Maori. 2.4.4 Eldest and firstborn. Finally, we review the terms that meant 'eldest' or 'firstborn' in Tables 42 and 43. For the evidence on PEPn &gt; PCEPn &gt; PMq *ata- riki 'firstborn son', see Table 29. The Hawaiian agreement with *mata-hiapo in Table 43 is not matched by other MQ, and may be a borrowing from TA. 2.5. CONSANGUINES OF THE GRANDCHILD'S GENERATION (+2) 2.5.1 Grandchildren. As can be seen from Table 44, there was a tendency for PPn *maku- to become moko- or mo'o, but there is abundant evidence that all the main protolanguages other than PTo and PTa retained the old vowel pattern. The agreement of PNPn *makupuna with PCP *makubu- (Geraghty 1983) makes clear the PPn vowel situation. We should consider the possibility of a PPn alternate pronunciation, **mokopuna, but since there are no alterna- tions or doublets recorded for living languages, all having one pronunciation or the other (but not both), I am compelled to suggest independent develop- ments: one in PTo that was shared by East Futunan, East Uvean,55 and Anutan, TABLE 36.

The change is also seen in a remote Tuamotuan language, Rangiroa, but its description is rather recent (Ottino 1972), and its kin terms seem otherwise influenced by Neo-Tahitian. 2.5.2 (Great)-great-grandchildren. Special words and constructions for great- grandparents and more senior relatives are not often cognate around Polynesia, and the simple grandparent term is often used for more senior generations (see 2.I). Similarly, in a large number of languages, reflexes of PPn *makupuna 'grandchild' also specify (great-)great-grandchildren, and so forth. In those lan- guages, there are no special terms for relatives more junior than grandchildren, and this may have been the case in PPn and other Polynesian protolanguages. The living languages that show this pattern include at least East Uvean, East Futunan, Anutan, Tokelauan, and Rapanui. This is a small number, but none of my sources for Niuean, Rennellese, Tikopian, Pukapukan, Samoan, Vaitupu, Kapingamarangi, and Nukuoro specify how (great-)great-grandchildren are named. It is possible that some of them follow the pattern of simply using the 'grandchild' term. TABLE 41.

These occur in at least Tongan, Mangaian, Manihiki, and Ha- waiian, as well as in at least some Fijian dialects, but there are formal differences, as seen in Table 45. The Tongan system is formally different from the Fijian, which uses a pre- fix, and is identical to nothing else within Pn except Mangaian. This makes Tongan and Mangaian seem to be independent developments. The agreement of the N.Z.

Recall that numerous TA languages reflect *moko-tua for 'grandchild', rather than *mokopuna. Possibly this is the PPn *tua- 'ordinal prefix' seen in the N.Z. Maori, Manihiki, and Hawaiian constructions. Thus we wonder whether this is a very old pattern or, alternately, the result of Hawaiian bor- rowing from Manihiki or a TA language that once had the Manihiki system.56 The borrowing or independent development possibilities seem appealing, for there is agreement between Rapanui, TA, and MQ languages for a competing type of reconstruction meaning (great-)great-grandchild and such. The second group of agreements involve the use of PEPn *hina, which otherwise meant 'grey, grey hair'. This is mentioned in 2.1I, where the '(great-)great-grandparent' terms are used as reciprocals in some languages. The agreements consist of at least those seen in Table 46. The N.Z. Maori form whaka-hina suggests an origin for the term: 'to make grey' (PPn *faka 'causative prefix' + *sina 'grey hair'). Rapanui agrees with the reconstruction of *hina-rere, but reconstruction to PEPn in the absence of external evidence is problematic, as this could be a borrowing from Tahitian. 3.

Biggs (1994) gives most of the evidence above and reconstructs PPn *?a- hawa(n,i)a 'marry, spouse', while I here assert that it ended in the common *-na kin suffix of PPn, rather than PPn *-Ja 'nominalizer'. PNPn seems to have changed to the *-ja ending (with Samoan dropping the final *-na and lengthening the remaining final vowel, as it does in other kin terms, and with Sikaiana and Takuu then seen as returning to the -na pattern). We might wonder if there were competing forms *?aahawaja and *?aahawana in PNPn, with some difference in meaning, but no language has reflexes of both possible forms, and this solution would require numerous independent losses. Although I have reconstructed dis- tinctions to PPn in other sections that do not exist in any Pn language today, I have done so only when present evidence leaves us with no other compelling explana- tion. The absence of doublets of the present form in living languages suggests that such was also true in the past. Whether the MQ forms are related to the others is difficult to say. It is a cu- rious agreement, with both Marquesan and Mangarevan having irregular re- tention of PPn *h if it is related. If related, there is a missing first vowel and the loss of *w in Mangarevan, and there is an odd doublet in Marquesan, one showing retention of *w and the other a shift to glottal stop.57 Those MQ forms are not good cognates and may be fortuitous resemblances, or they may represent some kind of morphological reanalysis. They cannot, on phonologi- cal grounds, be accepted as evidence of the form existing in PEPn, PCEPn, or PMq.58 While there was *?awahana 'spouse, marry' in PPn (and it certainly con- tinued into all the major subgroups other than Eastern Polynesian), some Tahitic languages and Hawaiian show an equivalence of modern *fafine 'woman' forms, with 'wife, wife's sisters, man's brother's wives; women eli- gible to become ego's wife', and modern *ta?ane 'man' forms with 'husband, TABLE 47.

The common non-Ellicean Outlier term is found in at least the languages given in Table 50. Special terms are given by some sources for cospouses, which nor- mally meant cowives, but in some instances referred to cohusbands. It is only be- tween CEPn languages, however, that any agreements allow for reconstruction (Table 51). 3.2 SIBLINGS-IN-LAW. Ego's same-sex siblings-in-law were named with a special word in all the main protolanguages, and one's behavior toward them approximated the restraint and avoidance shown to cross-sex siblings in those Pn societies that had brother-sister avoidance (Firth 1970:282-285).

The difficulties of a seman- tic reconstruction for PPn are considered with respect to the same-generation consanguinal terms. There is no doubt, however, that it meant 'same-sex sib- ling-in-law' by PEPn times, or at least by PCEPn times, if the Rapanui term is a borrowing from Tahitian. 3.3 CHILDREN- AND PARENTS-IN-LAW. The common child-in-law term is found in Table 54. Geraghty and Pawley (I981) reconstruct PCP *vugao- 'parent/child-in-law', and there is evidence from Western Polynesian and Out- lier languages that it may have remained a reciprocal term in PPn, PNPn, and PEc, as can be seen in Table 55. But, as that table shows, there is also good evidence that a new term, PPn *furjawai 'parent-in-law' (see Table 56), had come into use, and that the older term referred more commonly to 'child-in-law' TABLE 51.

'The Eas form is suspected of being a borrowing from Tah because it lacks the glot- tal stop.

There is a curious tendency for the sources to report a 'child-in-law' term but not specifically to report a 'parent-in-law' term. Still, it would seem that there was PPn *fujaona 'child-in-law' and PPn *furjawai 'parent-in-law', and that when a language lost one term and placed the burden of both meanings on one word, it was always *fujawai that was lost and *fuijaona that was retained. An exception is Nanumea, which seems to have retained onlyfugaona but gave it the meaning 'parent-in-law'. Although Biggs (1994) reconstructs PPn *furjaona 'affine', I think we can say that 'child-in-law' was its primary sense and con- trasted with PPn *fujawai 'parent-in-law'. Pawley (pers. comm.) notes that it is suspicious that whenever PPn *furjawai was replaced, the replacement was with a reflex of *furaona. Thus it seems that PPn *furjaona continued to have a secondary sense of 'parent-in-law' or the reciprocal relationship. If there was a term that meant 'affine (in general)' it would seem to have been PPn **furjao, but only Efu and Haw give evidence of such a term, and they would seem to be local developments on distributional grounds.6' There are no reconstructable terms for affines of the second or greater ascending or descending generations.

Clark says concerning the history of the sibling terms in Pn languages that "it will be seen that all the developments in the attested languages can be accounted for in terms of two processes: (I) replacement of terms by forms other than the original four; (2) elimination of semantic dis- tinctions. The semantic simplifications . . . seem to follow a single sequence: the elder-younger distinction for same-sex siblings is lost first, then the male- female distinction for cross-sex; and finally the same-different sex distinction, leaving a single term" (Clark 1975:86). These generalizations about Polynesian sibling terms can be applied in a general way to Polynesian kin terms as a whole. The ancestral system seems to have been more complex than that presently found in Eastern Polynesia, many Outliers, and Samoa. By "complex" I simply refer to a situation in which one language has more distinctions than another. Some distributions involving more complex terms are limited to Tongic and languages that have been influenced by Tongic. J. Fox's observation (pers. comm.) to me that Tikopian may have some borrowings of East Uvean and Tongan kin vocabulary, like Anutan, led me to examine Tikopian vocabulary in general. This resulted in the finding that Tikopian shares about twenty-five percent of the probable Anutan borrowings from East Uvean and Tongan. This may be due to Tikopian borrowing from Anutan, or it may be due to Tikopian borrowing directly from East Uvean or Tongan (by way of the same kinds of East Uvean and Tongan intrusions onto the island that are now posited for Anutan [see Feinberg I989]). Then there is another group of words that are found mainly in Tongic or lan- guages known to have borrowed from Tongic, but that are also found in Rennellese. One reason for this could be the very early divergence of Rennellese from other Nuclear Polynesian. The agreements consist of the occurrence of appar- ent reflexes of PPn *ta?o-kete 'same-sex sibling', *fosa 'man's son', and *ta?a- hine 'girl'. The fact that Rennellese has these forms suggests that they should be reconstructed for PPn, as well as for PTo and PNPn. Either Rennellese has a splen- didly conservative kin term system or it, too, has borrowed from a language more similar to Tongic, East Futunan, or East Uvean, than to Ellicean. It must be left to future study to determine whether Rennellese has general post-PPn borrow- ings from central or southern Western Polynesian. As with all other areas of vocabulary, East Uvean shows a great deal of bor- rowing from Tongan in its kin terms. But whereas doublets are often to be found in the other areas of vocabulary, I know of no doublets among the kin terms. There are occasional East Futunan agreements with East Uvean and Tongic, where no cognates or loans are known from the rest of Polynesia. But the over- all system in East Futunan seems little affected by East Uvean or Tongic, just as Burrows (1936) noted generally about the culture at various points in his ethnography of East Futuna. Samoan is the most innovative high-island language with respect to kin terms. Most of the changes of Samoan seem to have occurred after its divergence from 246</page><page sequence="53">KIN TERMS IN THE POLYNESIAN PROTOLANGUAGES Eastern Polynesian and Ellicean Outlier, and involve loss or semantic change. However, some are shared with Ellicean Outlier and not Eastern Polynesian. Such agreements are usually losses shared by Samoan and Ellicean Outlier that may simply be the result of independent simplifications. Tokelau shares some words with Samoan that it does not share with other Ellicean Outliers or Eastern. Some of these may be shared retentions, and Tokelauan may not have shared in all the simplifications presently apparent from Tuvalu westward. Some could be recent Samoan loans in Tokelauan, but when they follow the PPn pattern, it is difficult to determine whether a form is a shared retention or a post-PEc borrowing from Samoa. Tuvalu has a possible reflex of PPn *ta?o-kete 'same-sex sibling' that the other Ellicean Outliers do not seem to have.62 This may be a late borrowing from non-Ellicean, or it could be direct inheritance. Just as Tokelau may have late borrowings of kin terms from Samoa, Tuvalu could have post-PPn borrow- ings from Tongic, East Uvean, and/or East Futunan. The non-Ellicean Outliers have only the *nopine 'wife' word, which they share with no other languages. Their kin vocabularies are well documented, relative to the Ellicean Outliers. As with the study of shared sporadic sound changes, the impression with kin terms is one of early divergence of these lan- guages from the Nuclear Polynesian homeland area. The common agreement of Tikopian, and not just Anutan, with East Uvean and Tongan caused me to make an examination of general Tikopian vocabulary. This showed some of the same borrowings from at least East Uvean as those that have long been known for Anutan. The little-documented Taumako was classified by Bayard (I966, I976:8I) as an Ellicean Outlier, but was left unclassified by Pawley (1967), Howard (I98I), and Wilson (I985:89). Here we find that it retains many PPn kin terms not found in Ellicean Outlier, and is thus an important independent witness to PPn. It seems on the basis of kin terms to be non-Ellicean (unclassified) rather than Ellicean or Ellicean Outlier. There are only two Ellicean Outliers that have been well described by the classic ethnographers: Ontong Java (Luangiua) and Kapingamarangi. Both of these languages and the bits of other Ellicean kin terms given by Bayard (1976: I23-I24) suggest massive simplifications in Proto-Ellicean Outlier. But some of the daughters are not described, and it is not safe to make such a con- clusion at the present time. Niuean shares two features with Tahitic that may be borrowings.63 These are the prefixing of kainanga 'social group' with mata-, and the naming of the grand- father as tupuna taane. Still, Niuean retains many elements of PTo that were inher- ited from PPn, and remains an important source of evidence about PTo and PPn. Rapanui seems to have its own pattern. Its generally Eastern Polynesian pro- file does not follow the odd sound changes of TA or MQ and seems simply to be its own-when such matters are determinate. 247</page><page sequence="54">OCEANIC LINGUISTICS, VOL. 35, NO. 2 Hawaiian has some of the sporadic sound changes of MQ: loss of second vowel of *tua-ja?ane 'woman's brother' ([kai]-ku-naane), loss of the second syl- lable of *tama-?iti 'child' (keiki), loss of the first vowel of *ta?o-kete 'ego's same- sex sibling-in-law' ([kaij-ko- 'eke), coalescence of the diphthong or loss of the un- stressed second vowel of *fuuaona 'child-in-law' (huunoona), and coalescence of the second vowel with the semivowel of *fujawai 'parent-in-law' (huunooai). Some of these changes can also be observed in some TA languages, but none can be attributed to PTa. All seem to have been features of PMq, and the simplest ex- planation for them in Hawaiian is that it is a PMq daughter. There are also some features that Hawaiian shares with TA, normally under circumstances where the situation in PMq is not certain, due to lack of Mqa or Mva cognates.64 These consist of the use of kaane (PPn *ta?ane) as the mascu- line qualifier in the 'grandfather' construction, the use of the maka-hiapo con- struction to indicate the firstborn, the shift of the vowels in the 'grandchild' word from *maku- to moko-, and the use of *ta?ane 'man' to also name a hus- band or woman' s brother-in-law. In none of these cases is it certain that Hawai- ian has borrowed from TA. While we cannot say that Hawaiian has or has not borrowed TA kin terms, it is a very different situation from a recent survey of cosmogony (Marck I996a, b). In the instance of the cosmogony study, little could be found of the Marquesic pattern at all, and a Tahitic pattern prevailed. In the instance of kin terms, there is a great deal that is demonstrably Marquesic, and then a small bundle of things that are indeterminate. This is consistent with a situation in Hawai'i where the Ta- hitian immigration of about A.D. 1200 gave rise to a different cosmogony and general mythical focus validating the status of new chiefs from Tahiti, but not one that resulted in abandonment of idiosyncratic Marquesic pronunciations of kin terms. This reflects, perhaps, a difference in the extent of Tahitic-induced change in Hawaiian public life as opposed to household life. NOTES I.

In addition to Andrew Pawley and Malcolm Ross of my Ph.D. panel, James Fox, Richard Feinberg, and Paul Geraghty read and commented upon earlier versions of this paper. The present arguments are my own, but they have been shaped by all the above-mentioned people, especially in those parts of the work where personal com- munication from one or more of them is cited. 2. Most of the reconstructions to be mentioned below can already be found in POLLEX (Biggs 1994), and much of that work is credited to Ross Clark by Biggs. But the present work gathers data from a larger range of ethnographic sources and argues the list of reconstructable forms for each protolanguage.

(In the last mentioned, many of the kinship reconstructions are credited to R. Clark.) But Kuroiwa (1975) is unpublished, Clark's (1975) piece was a brief critical note, and Biggs's (1994) lexical reconstructions are cryptic and consider the forms only at the highest Pn level to which he or Clark makes a reconstruction. 5. Relatives by blood, as distinguished from "affines", relatives by marriage. 6. In some instances, we do not have enough information to say. But in no instance are collaterals said to be excluded from the basic definition of the term involved. 7. Biggs's (1994) reconstructions, many of which are from R. Clark's collaboration on that work, are not often different at all from what is reconstructed here. The main dif- ferences are that (i) Biggs's and Clark's reconstructions are made at the highest level possible, whereas those presented here are made at every level possible, (2) their evi- dence from living languages is generally less complete than what was developed here by reference to a larger number of ethnographic works, and (3) they do not flag PPn and PNPn reconstructions as problematic when the main evidence outsideTongic is from Anutan andTikopian. 8. The kinship database is available for viewing and/or copying from an Internet site that has the address: http://coombs.anu.edu.au/-marck/kinship.htm. 9. Although Polynesians themselves often do use the word "clan," because there is no other English word that captures the notion, other than "family" or "extended family." 10. Genealogies often go back to first-order anthropomorphic gods or lesser contempo- rary gods who were rarely worshipped directly. Departed ancestors were the more common object of propitiation, because in their intermediate position they were viewed as genealogically closer both to the living people and to the ancestral god, and they were possessed of divine power in their own right, independent of the founding god of the genealogy. I I. Those terms as they exist in contemporary Polynesian languages are often suggested by ethnographers to have something to do with food and eating (from PPn *kai 'to eat'). However, Pawley (1985:96-97) has shown that Proto-Oceanic *kai was a root having to do with people and kinds of people. It seems that these Polynesian forms come from that base rather than the base for 'eat(ing)' (POc *kani &gt; PPn *kai). For instance, POc *kani 'to eat' is found with the nasal in Nuclear Micro- nesian, a sound that was lost in these forms in PPn. However, Nuclear Micronesian agrees with PPn *kainanga, the kin group word, in not having a nasal between the first two vowels. Thus a base *kai and not *kani must have been involved at the Proto-Oceanic level. 12. The names of many of the clans themselves are cognate through that whole area and constitute, perchance, some of the oldest family names in the nonliterate world. Such agreement of clan names within Polynesia seems lacking except, perhaps, among a few non-Ellicean Outliers. (This is an impressionistic statement, for I have not attempted to organize those materials. However, I noticed no agreements when working with related materials, and none have been previously reported.) 13. **keineng is expected. 14. Where the ethnographic sources commonly relate it to the word for 'eat' (PPn *kai), if they speculate about the origin of the form. 15. Which was: "Clearly there was some kind of descent group associated with land in the society from which both Polynesian and Micronesian peoples are jointly de- scended. But how in the course of history could this ancestral descent group come to 249</page><page sequence="56">OCEANIC LINGUISTICS, VOL. 35, NO. 2 be nonunilinear in some places and unilinear in others? And where it is unilinear, how could it become patrilineal here and matrilineal there?" 16. Although they speak a Nuclear Micronesian language, it is one with extensive bor- rowings from Tuvalu, and possibly directly from Samoan. Like Tuvalu people, the Kiribatese have "the universal belief . .. that [their] forefathers came from Samoa" (Grimble I989:255). 17. Kuroiwa (1975) and Biggs (1994) reconstruct a long second vowel for PPn. I do not, for reasons explained in Marck (n.d.c). It is a part of a larger problem of the interpre- tation of a lengthening process that affected antepenultimate *a in NPn more than TO (and therefore, I argue, not always PPn). I8. PPn *fVs- &gt; Efu vVs-. I9. As Rogers (I977:163 n. 23) mentions in relation to personal communication from R. Clark. 20. Beaglehole and Beaglehole (1938:237-239) and Hecht (1977:196-I99) relate a custom on Pukapuka that seems unique in Polynesia, whereby the mayakitanga is a "sacred maid," secluded, celibate, and a symbol of the burial lineage. Rather than a father's sister, she was more often the lineage chief's eldest daughter (Hecht 1977: I96). 21. The sources commonly relate that this is how Polynesians specify exact relation- ships (e.g., Mead 1930:126). It can be a bit amusing when they seem to imply that English is able to accomplish such tasks with greater ease. Mead provides an ex- ample: "endless circumlocutory phrases are resorted to" being her words, but in fact English is no better equipped to exactly specify "the sister of the father of my mother" (one of her examples) than the typical Polynesian language. All English consistently does "better" than a typical Polynesian system is to distinguish lineals from collaterals. However, the context of such remarks on the part of such authors was the existence of the relatively "exact" systems being discovered in Africa, North America, and Australia. 22. Pawley (pers. comm.) notes that Samoan sometimes adds glottal stop irregularly, usually before stressed vowels, such as in the dual pronouns, and that borrowings from Tongan are probably not the cause in those instances. 23. But vice-versa for Tongan. 24. Blust (1994:66). 25. Milke (1958), Chowning (i 99 1:65). 26. At least two Tahitic languages have the older first-vowel pattern (Mao, Tua [obs.] matua), but this may have been a return to the former pattern under the influence of the plural PTa *maatua. 27. See previous note. 28. Except in Niu, which may be a borrowing from EPn. 29. "Western" Polynesia is always a geographical term and is not a linguistic subgroup. Here I use the term to refer to Tongan, Samoan, East Futunan, East Uvean, Tuvalu, and Tokelauan. 30. Possibly from an old vocative. Cf. Ren tamau 'classificatory father (voc.)'. 31.

Which is abandoned in the present work. Biggs's evidence is from East Futunan, non-Ellicean Outliers, and Ellicean Outliers. 33. Geraghty (pers. comm.) suggests PCP *tuxa-. 34. The vae possibly coming from an old vocative for 'mother'. 35. Pawley (pers. comm.) relates that masi is a common Polynesian short form for masaki 'sick'. 250</page><page sequence="57">KIN TERMS IN THE POLYNESIAN PROTOLANGUAGES 36. There was no late prehistoric settlement ofTongans who came to the island, as there was on East Uvea, and the potential borrowings seem more a function of social con- tacts with East Uvea and possiblyTonga and Fiji than a matter of invasion or whatever other word we might use to characterize the social and demographic background of East Uvean borrowings from Tongan. 37. Ton, Euv, and Efu share words of the form *faka-fotu 'woman's brother's child', but this is unique in Pn and an apparent post-PPn local development, with possible bor- rowing around the area. 38. Chowning there states that "the first syllable is absent... in most Polynesian lan- guages." As we have seen above, this is true only of Eastern Polynesian languages, and the first syllable is reconstructed to all Polynesian protolanguages other than PEPn and its daughters. 39. Although Pawley, who first made formal arguments for PEO, and others have aban- doned the subgroup, it remains a convenient label for reconstructions made on the basis of witnesses restricted to eastern Melanesia, Polynesia, and Nuclear Micronesia (which was Biggs's [I965] original purpose in naming such a group). 40. Ross (1988). It was *tazi in PCP (P. Geraghty, pers. comm.). 41. As is otherwise suggested mainly by such Samoan retentions. 42. Although Mqa and Mva (but not Haw) often do. 43. POc and PCP *tuka- have been proposed as alternate reconstructions, but I am in- clined to believe that the lost second vowel is from reduction, as occurs occasionally in Polynesian languages, rather than an old doublet. 44. In Tau, which may be a case of coalescence, if the vowel is actually long. 45. A geographical term and not a subgroup name. 46. He seems not to have been aware of the Taumako cognate. 47. Except the ha'anga 'cross-sex cross-cousin' of Rennell and nearby Bellona. 48. Non-Ellicean Outliers are unclassified Nuclear Polynesian languages, and their common ancestor is here taken to be PNPn. 49. The fieldwork was in 1947 and 1950. 50. Although this seems a general trend in world cultures (R. Feinberg, pers. comm.). 51. As expressed in some idealized descriptions. The frequency of such marriages has not been documented. 52. Ignoring rules that applied or did not apply to the highest chiefly lines. 53. As opposed to "indirectly inherited", that is, borrowed (from Tahitian missionaries). 54. The reconstruction is indeterminate. The first syllable of the East Uvean word sug- gests Tongan influence, while the vowels of the second syllable suggest that it kept its original pronunciation in that component of the word (if it was originally *qa- fafine). But it is possible that qo-fafine was the original form, and that Nuclear Polynesian innovated. 55. Or may be independent developments in Euv and (especially) Efu. 56. Or still has the system, but it is not given in the sources. Vaitupu sources (kinship database), for instance, indicate use of the ordinal prefix tua- to show degrees of dis- tance among collaterals, but do not mention a use associated with naming degrees of descent. 57. This alternation is otherwise known in Marquesan and, apparently, in Mangarevan (Yoram Meroz, pers. comm.; cf. Dordillon 1931:76). 58. A loan possibility should be mentioned, TO being the main possible source due to the retention of PPn *h. But it is not very satisfying to present a loan hypothesis sim- ply because there is no other easy explanation. One would expect a broader set of borrowings, rather than just an isolated word like this (but see Langdon I989 and Marck n.d.b). 25I</page><page sequence="58">OCEANIC LINGUISTICS, VOL. 35, NO. 2 59. The resemblance of PPn *maqa 'ego's same-sex sibling-in-law' to PPn *maa 'shame' has been noted by Kuroiwa (1975), and the resemblance of their pro- nunciations in modern languages was earlier noted by numerous ethnographers (the words have no difference in pronunciation in the many languages that lose the PPn glottal stop). But we have no other example of PPn glottal stop being inserted to cre- ate a minimal pair, and cannot be certain that "shame" was the origin of the PPn word for 'ego's same-sex sibling-in-law'. 60. Terms for ego's cross-sex siblings-in-law (WZ, HB, etc.) cannot generally be recon- structed, due to lack of mention of such terms in the sources and lack of agreement among sources when they are given. Generally, the terms for 'wife's sister' and 'husband's brother' are the same as the terms for 'wife' and 'husband', which are, in turn, commonly the general words for 'woman' and 'man' when they are mentioned in the sources. The same was probably true in some of the protolanguages, but we cannot say for certain, based on present sources (in the kinship database). 6 i. The lexicalization of *fungawai in PPn is suggested, for all languages that have it re- flect that form when pre-Pn **fungao-ai was certainly involved. 62. Although kin terms are largely unpublished from some of the Ellicean speaking is- lands. 63. R. Clark (pers. comm.) warned me to be alert for Niuean borrowings from Tahitic. See McEwen (1970:viii-ix). 64. So the question of direct inheritance from PCE and PMq, or indirect inheritance from TA, cannot be resolved. REFERENCES Aitken, Robert T. 1930. Ethnology of Tubuai.
