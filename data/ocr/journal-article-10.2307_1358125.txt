<plain_text><page sequence="1">Susanne Wenger and Nigeria's Sacred Osun Grove BETTY LADUKE Susanne Wenger's monumental sculptural images throughout the Osun Grove in Oshogbo, Nigeria, are unforgettable -to be among them is a spiritual experience. Born in Graz, Austria, in 1915, Wenger came to Nigeria in 1950 with her husband, anthropologist Ulli Beier, and eventually made it her spiritual as well as her physical home. As she settled among the Yoruba, she also absorbed their religious beliefs. Wenger dedicated herself to the wor- ship of Yoruba "orishas" and in time was accepted as a cult priestess. Upon learning that Wenger was an artist, the Yoruba priest and Wenger's subsequent mentor, Ajagemo, asked her to help repair some of the ancient shrines located in a sacred grove paralleling the Osun River. Later Ajagemo and his followers encouraged her to build new shrines, incorporating her personal vision. This colossal, ongoing project, begun in the 1960s, extends over many acres and is overseen by the ten-foot-tall sculpted form of Yoruba goddess Osun, the mother of all. Osun stands astride a large river fish-one of her sacred messengers-her arms outstretched to welcome her daily visitors. Osun is also the protector of Oshogbo. According to beliefs, her pact with the residents is renewed annually at the Osun Festival held the last week of August, when special homage is given to Osun by the thousands who come to pray, offer sacrifices, and bathe in and drink from the Osun River. Wenger's dynamic, free-standing sculptural forms, espe- cially the shrines of Iyamoopo and Alajere (Fig. 1), are integrated into the sacred Osun Grove. They soar as high as 20 feet and, like ancient trees, their bases spread as wide as 50 feet. Their central core often comprises numer- ous restless, intertwining human forms that suggest a maze in which conflict and struggle coexist. But ultimately the conflict is resolved and the overwhelming feelings are of peace and protectiveness. The strain of Wenger's life-dedi- cation to this project is evident in the lined face and tense eyes of this tall, lean woman, now in her mid-seventies. THE EARLY YEARS In The Return of the Gods: The Sacred Art of Susanne Wenger, Beier offers insights into Wenger's creative develop- ment and the Yoruba religion that has nurtured her for almost 40 years. Ironically, Beier relates that because there was no art school in Wenger's native Graz, her early art studies were limited to "ornamental pottery and small ani- mal sculptures."' Wenger has commented: "What you think is an accident finally leads you in the right direction. After all, my shrines now are really a kind of pottery."2 ATc ?40i 4W NO Z7* #? i- - Y Al.? 40 i.~YC~I-~a-t Fig. 1. Susanne Wenger, Alajere Shrine (c. 1970s), mud and cement, app. 40' h. x 100' d.

Wenger later attended the Vienna Academy of Art for two years, where, in addition to developing her drawing skills through detailed renderings of landscape and animal forms, she learned the ancient fresco technique. She was a founding member of the Vienna Art Club and worked as an illustrator for a children's magazine. During World War II, her work became more inwardly directed; she produced a series of mythological drawings that she later transcribed into expressionistic-style paintings. "When the bombs fell in Vienna and we were in air raid shelters, I did small drawings to make the time go faster. I have always kept</page><page sequence="2">18 Woman's Art Journal ;;e N.V~l I.

Then I did pictures from this source.."3 She spent an intellectually stimulating year in Paris in 1949 but soon tired of cafe debates, and when Beier offered her a trip to Nigeria in 1950,Wenger was delighted. Six months after they arrived in Oshogbo, a city of approx- imately 720,000 in Western Nigeria, Wenger fell ill and remained in bed for a year. During this period Wenger first encountered the Yoruba orishas. With recovery, a dramatic transformation took place in her art: she changed from European-based Expressionism to the flat, geometric pat- terning found in African art. Using long strips of cotton and the traditional Yoruba cassava starch resist medium, she began interpreting Yoruba creation myths. As her images became more detailed and complex with the introduction of subtle color variations, she turned to the hot flowing wax of the batik process, a stronger, more flexible resist. In 1951, when Wenger first heard Ajagemo's drums, she immediately intuited their meaning because, as Beier explains, "on the archaic level man has many symbols in common." A special relationship evolved between Ajagemo and Wenger as she gradually absorbed the Yoruba world view, learned the language, and became a worshipper of the orishas. "To Susanne Wenger," Beier continued, "art with a religious function carefully serves the same purpose as ritual in that it can help one to overstep the boundaries between physical and metaphysical life."4 In the 1960s Western Nigeria was, according to Beier, "one of the most rewarding places in the world for cultural exchange, a real melting pot of ideas, a cultural hothouse. One's very foreignness was appreciated, and one was able to contribute to the life of the town."5 For many years, Beier was chairman of the African Studies Department at the University of Ife. After more than ten years of marriage, Wenger and Beier divorced, but they remained close friends. Shortly thereafter, Wenger married a Yoruba drummer with whom she shared her spiritual concerns and ritual prac- tices. He had children with his other wives (polygamy is legal and common among the Yoruba), and Wenger "ritu- ally adopted his eight children." Wenger's African husband frequently accompanied her to Europe,6 where she exhibited her batik paintings and smaller silk-screen prints, all inspired by Yoruba mythol- ogy, along with batiks, wood and stone sculptures, and paintings by other Nigerian artists. Sales from the Euro- pean exhibits as well as from the shop in her Oshogbo home (in itself a miniature museum) have been the major source of income and support for her work at the grove. YORUBA RELIGION: AN OVERVIEW To the Yorubas, the high god Olodumare is an all-powerful, almighty "sky god." Since Olodumare is far away, the orishas act as divine mediators. Beier claims that Western- ers have difficulty understanding Yoruba religious views because "there are no fixed rules, no guidebook to the gods for the Yorubas .... Each orisha is the universe looked at from another angle."' The innumerable orishas represent, according to Beier, certain natural forces, historical personalities, animals and the magic qualities of minerals, or even colors. To certain individuals, some of these forces are congenial, others destructive, and the art of living consists of knowing who has to be in tune with what .... The real "African science" is the accumulated knowledge in the collective conscious- ness of a people of how to live in tune with the non-human world.8 In Wenger's life and work, the three most significant orishas are Osun, Obatala, and Alajere. Osun represents the water of life, which she gives to all other orishas. She ensures pregnancy, cures disease, and fulfills wishes. Obatala is a passive god of understanding who accepts responsibility for failures. Obatala is like the elephant, the strongest and most peaceful animal of the forest. In contrast, Alajere has a restless, creative spirit and is full of contradictions. Alajere is symbolized by fire, leopards, horsemen, as well as the zebu, a cow whose long horns symbolize suffering. The mythical meeting of these two opposing personalities, Obatala and Alajere, inspired one of Wenger's temples.</page><page sequence="3">Woman's Art Journal 19 I lk- -Ak .. :...... ..... . ......... ... ... . .... ..... ............. 4??:.4i e z ii Fig. 3.

Other orishas and mythical figures represented by Wenger in the Osun shrine complex include Shango, god of thunder; Agum, the hunter; and Laro and Timehin, the founders of Oshogbo. Timehin is the great hunter, whereas Laro's search for water "is the constant search of man for the source and force of life, a search that has to be carried out constantly by all men and all deities at all times."' THE OSUN SHRINES The Yorubas believe that the psychic energy of the orishas is activated by the olorishas (worshippers) and their ritual activities. These include the Ose (weekly ceremony), where singing, drumming, dancing, and divination (a form of fortunetelling) are performed. Sometimes chickens are sac- rificed during these weekly ceremonies. The annual Osun celebration is attended by Oshogbo's entire population, Yorubas as well as Christians and Moslems, whom the Yoruba consider children of Osun. Yoruba shrines are sites for private as well as public ritual. Since they are dwellings for the gods, they are con- sidered sources of mystic power. Much of the forest that surrounds Osun Grove has been converted to farmland during the last two decades. As Beier explains, when the huge trees that housed spirits in their branches, stems, and roots were felled, the spirits became homeless, and "homeless forces are dangerous to mankind, as their : ,.,'.

The purpose of the entire work at Osun is to help the orisha to settle."10 In the 1960s, at the request of Ajagemo, Wenger began to repair and then to recreate the destroyed shrines. She began by following old ground plans, but as she constructed the mud walls, reinforcing them with cement, the struc- tured contours she and her assistants created became less rigid and more organically conceived than the originals. Outer surface walls and posts were embellished with relief or incised anthropomorphic images. Women elders often painted ritual designs on the shrines' interior and exterior walls. According to Beier: [Wenger] did not have to change in order to undertake this work. For years she had been painting symbols, had con- ceived art as the archaic language, had made batik pictures (and silk-screen prints) of orisha myths. The building of the shrines was merely a way of extending this work into another dimension. [Her] sculptures are houses, [her] gates are trees, [her] walls are forests, [her] shrines are sculptures." One does not have to believe in Yoruba gods to find refuge in the Osun Grove or to sense that the shrines and sculpture create a communion "between man and spirits."12 The first large structure one encounters when approach- ing the main section of the Osun Grove is the Gate of Arugba (Fig. 2). Built with mud and cement over an arma-</page><page sequence="4">20 Woman's Art Journal ture of steel and wire mesh, the wide arch of flowing abstract forms represents the curved back of a tortoise, which, in this location, represents the weight of the world made light by the presence of Osun. Throughout the grove and along the paths Wenger's monumental sculptures of Shango, Obatala, Alajere, and other goddesses and gods seem to suddenly appear from the depths of the foliage. Next are a long curved wall and a gate created by Wenger's collaborator for more than 20 years, Adebisi Akanji. Top- ping the gate are two enormous pythons that act as guard- ians of the grove, and decorating the wall are a playful array of mythical figures embossed with layers of heavy green moss. Finally, one encounters the tall, broad form of the god- dess Osun astride the riverbank. This image of Osun, the fourth erected on this spot, was created by Saka, another of Wenger's assistants. The first Osun was destroyed by the river, the second fell when its creator violated a taboo, and the third was rejected by Wenger as not powerful enough. In another section of the grove is an unusual house, Wenger's womblike Aiyedakun Shrine, or rest house (Fig. 3), dedicated to the mystical reunion of Shango and Obatala. Beier considers this building Wenger's "boldest creation ... a living house for the gods."'3 One must lower one's head to enter the narrow, oval-shaped passages that lead into the inner chambers where floors, walls, and ceil- ings merge into a rhythmic all-encompassing floral form. Inside is a narrow, winding staircase, at the top of which is a small, secluded chamber illuminated by the soft light that filters through cracks in the roof. Wenger dedicated this shrine to her mentor, Ajagemo, and she often uses the building for rest and contemplation. Wenger conceived each of the three buildings that com- prise the Busanyin Shrine as a bird, with the pointed tips of the thatched roofs as birds' heads (Fig. 4). The magnificent posts that support each roof were crafted by her assistants: Lamidi Aruisa, Rabiu Adeshu, Saka, and Buraimoh Ghadamosi. Wenger's relationship with her five artisan col- laborators, none of whom follow the Yoruba religion (they are either Moslem or Christian), is most unusual. She not only encourages their talents, she offers them creative chal- lenges as well. According to Wenger: In all my 25 years of commissioning work, I don't think there were three things I ordered that were useless. I tell the sculptor, "I need a piece so many feet tall," and I don't give him any restrictons, except that it should be a king sign it. Besides their individual projects, these artisans, trained as bricklayers and carpenters, collaborate with Wenger on the construction of her monumental forms, which require extensive bamboo scaffolding to support their soaring heights. As the work progresses, it blends with the profuse vegetation of the surrounding tropical forest, evolving like seedlings from simple to complex. An amphitheater located near the Busanyin Shrine is populated by a multitude of figures-drummers, hunters, an elephant rider, mothers and children-many of which, according to Beier, "represent the spirits that come from the forest, out of the earth and from the trees; deceased hunters and ancestors, not powerful enough to become orishas, but who people the forest as spirits; anonymous forces, but nevertheless spirits with whom contact is impor- tant."14 These amphitheater figures were designed and con- structed by Saka and contain seats integrated with the forms so that visitors can rest and contemplate the spirits. Along the main road are two more of Wenger's anthropomorphic gates: a tortoise, symbolic of earth, old age, and wisdom, and an extraordinary elephant, symbol of the god Obatala, whose arched trunk projects high over the road. A short distance beyond Obatala's trunk are two massive, free-standing shrine sculptures of Iyamoopo and Alajere, each more than 20-feet high. According to Beier, traditional Yoruba art is naturalis- tic, the carving "produced by a kind of pressure from within: forehead, eyes, breast and belly all pushed out- wards and the surface of the figure has the tension of a blown-up balloon."''5 The forms are rounded, unified, and quiet. Wenger's sculptural style, while based on Yoruba spirit and mythology, betrays her European expressionist background. Her temples, shrines, and sculptures utilize complex writhing, curved, and angled shapes that often soar heavenward. The mystical, magical mood of the Osun Grove extends to Wenger's unique three-story home located a mile from the grove. Leading to the stairs and entryway is Adebisi Akanji's four-foot-high mud and cement fence composed of figures of acrobats, children, musicians, animals, and spirit creatures. The innumerable masks attached to the walls of her home and wood and stone carvings set out on tables and the floor were commissioned by Wenger from her arti- san collaborators. She also surrounds herself with rocks, shells, bones, feathers, bells, drums, and objects of ritual significance. A downstairs room has been converted into a shop where batiks, carvings, jewelry, and craft objects are displayed and sold to tourists. At first she resented tourists, but soon learned that "one cannot be too strict with one's ideas . .. and with visitors. .. . If people come to look, it is a right kind of response." However, on the three days a week she works in the grove on her "largest sculpture ever," she does not greet visitors. Wenger believes that there are two directions artists can follow: the typical development of a modern artist, asserting one's personality for individual expression, or submerging one's freedom to create art that functions as ritual. She has chosen the latter. She believes that if one works and lives a relaxed life, things mostly arrange them- selves: "It is silly to say we live our lives. Life lives us." Wenger is protective of the sacred grove, referring to the encroachment of local commercial interests as the "slaughter of the gods." She feels "it is worthwhile to work a long lifetime to save a few trees and a few miles of sacred river land." Even religion, she says, is not as it was before, "when every moment was considered as sacred time .... There has been a secularization of the sacred." Although she still has friends in Europe, she does not miss sophisti- cated European intellectuals. "All the people in front of my house-their emanations, their feelings-I prefer to live with them than with all my European friends." Wenger is very much involved with the Yoruba culture, where "everything is created by the spirit." She considers art to be "without meaning, without consequences, if the gods are not involved. For me God in heaven is as much an animal, a tree, or a stone." She believes human beings are but distorted images of gods. Nevertheless, Wenger's work represents an affirmation of the human spirit. As a younger woman she told Beier she believed that "what we build in Osun could help people to regain a clearer vision of the world. If the gods can settle again and feel content in the forest, then we can share this contentment because we carry part of the divine being in us."'6 The relentless struggle to raise money to continue the Osun project has taken its toll on Wenger. Although in the early years "Europeans often considered her a white priest-</page><page sequence="5">Woman's Art Journal 21 ess, a latter-day Gauguin, a degenerate artist looking for stimulation," she is now well known and respected through- out Yoruba country, and her artistic forms are "acceptable as an expression of Yoruba religion to the most traditional of Yorubas."" She and her assistants now receive salaries from the Commission of Museums and Monuments of the Nigerian federal government, and in 1987 her shrines were declared national monuments.Wenger's home and collec- tions were also declared national monuments, with every- thing in the house catalogued by government employees. Wenger worked unassisted on her most recent shrine project. She explained, "My work is getting more and more intense, and I was getting very nervous about the details. I then realized I had to do it alone." She compares her work to the trees, "coming from the same root .... When you ask me what or how I am doing it, I don't know how to express myself. .. or rationally to account for what I'm doing ... a fusion of the human and tree spirits." She even compared the masklike faces and bulbous eyes of her figura- tive sculptures to "the tall trees that lay open their faces to the gods and the angels. The universe is like one eye of the orishas . .. the big eyes. .. an impression of the sky, very wide, like a universe filled with the complexity of the orishas." A small room in Wenger's house is reserved for painting. She works with oil paint on masonite approximately three by four feet. Her colors are thickly layered and brilliant, a shocking contrast to her monotone sculptures. She exhibited this series of paintings in Germany in 1988 to raise money for the Osun Shrine. Her paintings, she says, are "utterly Western." Susanne Wenger's primary commitment remains the Osun Grove shrines. The money she raises helps repair the damage from climatic erosion and visitor abuse. Wenger and her work at the grove have contributed to the Yoruba cultural heritage; both have become sources of inspiration for the new generation of traditional and contemporary artists and artisans now flourishing in Oshogbo. * 1.
