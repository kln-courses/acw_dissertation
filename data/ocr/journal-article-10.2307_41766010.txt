I began to recognize the images of large figures - frontal bird-women with small heads and arms, feathered fringes, and skirts like the spread tail-feathers of an eagle. Strange and compelling, these images seemed to have been deliberately carved to en- gage the early morning sunlight. Cutting across the body of one of the bird-women was the head of a superbly realistic stag. Human figures carrying staffs and wear- ing mushroom-shaped headdresses were posed in an eternal ritual dance. Bulls, bull-deer with elaborately embroidered bodies, wild goats and sheep, horses, a hand, and even a boat gradually emerged from the shadows of the stone. This was a place that had been established millennia ago as a sanctuary and was recon- secrated again and again by successive generations with hundreds of overlaid images. Slowly climbing the slope, moving from rock to rock, I was impressed by the rugged beauty of the setting and by the realization that here before me were symbolic forms representing thou- sands of years of mythic traditions. The site was that of Kalbak-Tash, a great outcrop- ping high above the Chuya River near its confluence with the Katun, in the southern half of the Soviet Union's Gorno-Altay, a land of high mountains, severe beauty, and ancient human history. It is an area that appears to be sparsely settled and devoid of any trace of ancient cities or fortified settlements. In actuality, this land of rocky peaks and rivers has been a cultural crossroads for thousands of years. Its mountain passes and valleys have served as routes out of the steppe of Kazakhstan northward to the taiga, the spruce and fir forest typical of Siberia, and eastward to the rich grass- lands of northern Mongolia. One could argue that the significance of the Gorno-Altay lies in its paradoxical nature: historically the range served both as barrier and as passage. At times harsh and forbidding, it also offered endless pasture for livestock and protected valleys for settlements. I was there to work with the Soviet archaeologist Vladimir Kubarev from the Academy of Science's Insti- tute of History, Philology, and Philosophy in Novosi- birsk. We were examining various sites as an initial step in a collaborative project on the archaeological sanctuaries, sviatilishcha in Russian, of the northern Altay. Such sanctuaries are found throughout Siberia. Identified by rock paintings and carvings, ritual altars or mounds, burials, or carved stelae - all are distin- guished by the presence of overlaid images or struc- tures. The landscape of such sites is also distinguished in some way- by its relationship to high mountain ridges, its particular command of a great valley, its close proximity to a river, or even the way in which it is illuminated by the rising or setting sun. It is impos- sible to say which came first - the ancient determination that a particular place was sanctified because of its sur- 48 Archaeology rounding landscape, or that, once marked, the place became sacrosanct and hence used for millennia, even when adjoining terraces or cliffs would have been just as practical. I joined forces with Kubarev because he is an archae- ologist and I am an art historian; the combination of our experience seemed right for the project. We are in- vestigating the sanctuaries of the southern Gorno-Altay so we can understand how their cultural layers are re- lated and whether there are recurring patterns in their relationship to the larger landscape. Kubarev has exca- vated and published material on some of the most re- markable Altaic sites of the Eneolithic, Bronze, and Early Iron ages.

In addi- tion, we share a common interest in seeking to under- stand the ways in which culturad levels relate to one another within these sanctuaries. Iťs a complex and, in some ways, an ambivalent matter: at some sites, the sub- sequent reuse and reworking of earlier images appear to respect sanctification of the site, whereas elsewhere one senses a conflict between that recognition and a desire to obliterate the earlier traces. Still unfamiliar to most Westerners, the Soviet Union's Gorno-Altay Autonomous Region is a land of broad plains and high mountains comprising 102,063 square miles, rising at a latitude comparable to Newfoundland. The Altay ridge extends deep into western Mongolia. To the northeast, the Altay Mountains merge into the Sayan Mountains of Tuva. Clustered along the southern border of the Gorno-Altay, the highest peaks, wrapped in eternal ice and snow, rise to over 13,000 feet. From the massive glaciers of these mountains descend count- less streams and rivers, the largest of which - the Biya, the Katun, and the Bukhtarma- serve as principal trib- utaries to the northward-flowing Irtysh and Ob. Over the millennia the Altay's rushing streams have bitten deep into the loess deposits in the river valleys, creating high terraces of good pasture. Above these terraces rise the steep flanks of the mountains forested with larch and birch on their northern slopes, their southern slopes September/October 1991 49</page><page sequence="5">1 s I I J- a n 5 rocky and forbidding. Along the rivers, scattered over extensive terraces, thousands of petroglyphs, stone ritual structures, and funerary monuments indicate how cultures with roots in Kazakhstan to the southeast and in western Siberia and Europe collided with a northern Siberian cultural tradition. Among the carved images, stone stelae, and elaborate stone mounds of these sanctuaries is fur- ther evidence of the intrusion of successive waves of nomads - Scytho-Siberian Early Nomads and Turks - beginning in the first millennium b.c. But an archaeo- logical silence descended here after the tenth century a.D., one characterized by a striking lack of ritual struc- tures and petroglyphs, and this silence testifies to the destruction of the Turkic hegemony in the Mongol ex- pansion of the thirteenth century. Today, the cultural life of the Altaic Turks is best traced through the tools of eth- nography rather than those of archaeology, since the archaeological record is so elusive. Only contemporary streamer-bedecked ritual bushes, or the ritual stone cairns called obo , built up by travelers or hunters on mountain ridges and passes, indicate the persistence of the Siberian sanctuary. Archaeological exploration has not been lacking in the region; indeed, since the nineteenth century the northern Altay has attracted the attention of explorers seeking to map its mountains, glaciers, and rivers. This century has seen the excavation of richly furnished burials at such sites as Tuekta, Bashadar, and Pazyryk- finds that have put the Gorno-Altay on the archaeologi- 50 Archaeology cal map. Until now, however, the concern of scholars has been with single cultural levels at individual sites. What Kubarev and I are studying are the relation- ships among different cultural levels. At Kalbak-Tash, for example, the intrusion of the deer-head over the bird- woman may well have been a deliberate fusing of two different images from two different periods that both refer to one fundamental concept. The bull-deer may also represent a purposeful conversion into a deer of an earlier bull form. Here, then, the images are made to "collaborate" with one another, the fusion uniting earlier meanings and images with later ones. In contrast, there are the burials recently excavated by Kubarev in the village of Karakol, one of the most important sites in the Gorno-Altay. The site lies on the left bank of the Ursul River between two of its tribu- taries, the Kuratoi and the Karakol. In 1985 villagers chanced on the remains of the ancient burials while erecting a memorial in front of their school. By happy coincidence Kubarev was staying in the village at the time and was asked to come to the site immediately. From excavations conducted over the next two seasons, he and his colleagues concluded that the burials them- selves were datable to the early second millennium b.c. and that they represented the richest evidence to date of Eneolithic culture in the Altay. The remarkable part of the discovery was what was found on the finely prepared stone slabs forming the coffins. The burials themselves contained few grave goods. The inner sides of the slabs, however, revealed strange images rendered through a combination of en- graving, punching, scratching, and painting. The im- ages combine anthropomorphic bodies with hands or claws or antlers, sun-crested heads, heads masked and horned, or heads in the form of loops. Some images are frontal and hieratic, whereas others in half-profile seem to hurry to the right or left. Curiously, the slabs clearly demonstrate a reuse over successive generations, perhaps even over centuries, before they were finally placed in the Karakol burials. On some of the slabs painted masked figures overlay others that had been scratched into the surface of the stone. Some of the enig- matic figures cover engraved images of naturalistic elk. Such imagery has seldom been encountered as far south in the Altay and refers back to the Baikal Neolithic cul- ture centered in the taiga much further to the north and eaat. The Altay region is rich in stone that is suitable for constructing burial chambers with relatively little reworking. Why, one must ask, would those who built the Karakol tombs bother to use a slab which had al- ready been worked, perhaps centuries earlier? And why should they have used it by overlaying imagery and by positioning the stones so that the original images lost their place of authority? It is as if the earlier images somehow both sanctified and threatened the stone and its purpose. A similar complexity or ambivalence of purpose emerges at a number of sanctuaries dominated by ritual and funerary structures. Despite their having had at</page><page sequence="6">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="7">The author, foreground, and archaeologist Kubarev examine petrogfyphs from the Bronze or Early Iron ages . their disposal a seemingly endless number of appropri- ate sites, the Early Nomads of the first millennium b.c. repeatedly located their burials beside those from the much earlier Afanasiev culture (early second millen- nium b.c.). The early Turks (fifth-tenth centuries a.D.) in turn located their stone kurgans, their rows of ritual stones (fyalbal), and their carved images of ancient heroes and of the dead directly beside the great barrows and stone stelae of the Early Nomads. Indeed, so extensive is the overlay and reuse of materials that at times it is not clear which stelae or ritual enclosures belong to what period, or how many times a stela may have been re- worked and refitted into a new complex. The stelae of Yustyd are another case in point. Yustyd, in the far southeastern corner of the Gorno-Altay, was recorded and excavated by Kubarev. It includes par- ticular kinds of stelae often referred to as "deer-stones" They were frequently carved so as to convey vaguely anthropomorphic characteristics. At Yustyd can also be found stone circles or sacrificial altars and a kind of large and elaborately organized stone mound with spokes radiating from the center and surrounding "walls." These mounds, called kereksur, were ritual, rather than funerary, in purpose. In their mapping of this site, Kubarev and his colleagues found pieces of about 30 stelae arranged in a line running from north to south. In their original position, each stone had faced the east and was flanked on the west by two or three cir- cular rings. The largest of the Yustyd stones had no clear anthro- pomorphic reference, but on one of its narrow sides was the engraved image of a dagger, and on one of its wider sides was the engraved image of a hammer. At the well-packed base of the stone, Kubarev found a number of stone pestles and phallic-shaped stones that appear to date to the Neolithic period. The finding of these materials suggests something about the complex- ity of cultural overlay here. While the erection of carved stelae is generally associated with the Late Bronze Age (early first millennium b.c.), the finds at the base of the stone indicate either that, when buried, they were considered to be treasured relics from an earlier age, or that the stone had actually been erected much ear- 52 Archaeology lier, as early as the Neolithic period, and recarved in the first millennium b.c. The elaborate arrangement of circular altars and kereksur is no less complex in its dating; even now, there is no consensus. Some argue for the Bronze Age, some for the Early Iron Age, while others believe that they could not predate the age of the early Turks. The Yustyd site exemplifies both the monumentality and the complexity of the megalithic ritual sites found throughout the mountainous region of Gorno-Altay. If the specific date and cultural association of each part re- main unclear, it is nonetheless certain that at some time this site was determined to be more sacred than others. For centuries, if not millennia, people returned to this vast and rocky plain to pay homage to ancestors and deities and, in effect, to reconsecrate the site. We do not know what considerations catalyzed the original selection of this place in the Yustyd plain. We do know that it must have depended heavily on specific charac- teristics of the larger surrounding landscape. The accumulation of cultural layers evidenced in the stone structures at Yustyd is not unique. Before leav- ing the Altay we went farther south along the Karakol River, where valley after valley is marked by great mounds, stelae, and rows of balbal. Several miles south of Karakol we came upon one of the most impressive complexes I had yet seen. The weather was cold and windy, promising the advent of winter. To the south- west, torn clouds revealed snow-covered mountains, while smaller mountains to the south, north, and east offered a dark and silent backdrop to the setting of the sanctuary. Situated in the middle of the great valley, the effective center of the sanctuary was marked by large stone burial mounds datable to the period of the Early Nomads. To the east and west, crowding up against the larger mounds, as if to partake of their power, were the smaller mounds of later Turkic burials. Neither the Early Nomadic nor the surrounding Turkic mounds has been scientifically excavated. Many of them, in fact, were plundered shortly after their construction. To the north and east of the mounds loomed huge mega- liths of uncertain date. Once straight, they now leaned like deeply rooted trees. On the base of one was carved, as if in afterthought, the blurred images of two ani- mals in Early Nomadic style. Rows of Turkic balbal run north-south, revealing deliberate, but still unfathomed, intention. As at Kalbak-Tash and Yustyd, the lay of the land here in the valley of the Karakol River must have marked for ancient peoples the potential sanctity of the place. Once claimed in the Bronze Age as sacred, that nature was reaffirmed over the millennia in burials, mounds, rows of stones, and stone carvings. When we are better able to unravel the dating of the various parts of these com- plexes and when we are more certain in our reconstruc- tion of symbolic systems, we will be able to write more surely the history of the peoples for whom the Altay's mountains and valleys offered passage, pasture, and protection. ■</page><page sequence="8">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page></plain_text>
