<plain_text><page sequence="1">Not Much Higher Than the Apes BY SHELDON G. WEEKS AFRICAN GENESIS. Robert Ardrey. New York: Atheneum, 1961. 381 pp. $6.95. "Not in innocence, and not in Asia, was mankind born." Man apparently emerged on the equatorial highlands of East Africa. Some of our ancestors' origins have been traced in Dr. L. S. B. Leakey's findings in Tanganyika's Olduvai Gorge, where nature has laid bare the events of a million and a quarter years ago. The decipherment from a few bones, skulls, stone tools, and arti- facts makes a dramatic story which Ardrey plays to its fullest. But there is no scientific agreement as to the pre-history of man, besides general acceptance of Africa as one cradle of civilization and the fact of man's re- treat there during the glacial epochs. Ardrey, a layman who became fas- cinated with the mystery of the evo- lution of man from his prehuman anthropoid ancestry (the territory of a branch of physical anthropology; regrettably Ardrey refers to it only as anthropology), has chosen sides in the controversy and done some of his own detective work. The first part of the study is de- voted to some material on the social organization of certain animals in Africa. The second part explores the development of proconsul, the terres- trial primate of 20 million years ago, and the development of the two aus- tralopitheci, a. robustus, the vege- tarian, and a. africanus, the meat- eater and early man. The question Ardrey asks is: which primate is really our ancestor? He believes that man would rather claim vegetarian roots than those of a violent hunter; it helps him to keep the romantic fal- lacy of the uniqueness of his own spe- cies, his innocence and purity, his Illusion of the Central Position. We know now that man is far from being the most specialized or advanced ani- mal, that he should not be placed at the top of the family tree, and that he is a comparatively young creature. Ardrey presents convincing evidence here. Unfortunately Ardrey has made the unifying theme of his book the dis- avowal of the uniqueness of man. He warns us against anthropomorphism but is himself guilty of evolutionary generalizations. It is clear from his material on animals and on primate life that a major factor in evolution- ary development was the situational context: ecological factors related to animal potentials. Such factors, in- 18 AFRICA TODAY</page><page sequence="2">cluding climatic changes, also played a significant part in the development of man. Ardrey claims that contemporary man and his civilization are limited by his animal origin and that his predatory instincts are a heritage from his true progenitor, the violent australopithecus africanus. But this argument can also be used against the thesis. A. africanus's ancestors were tree-swinging vegetarians, and a. africanus did not leave the trees to become a predator by choice but by necessity, so that his basic nature was and remains "pure." On the other hand, it has been shown that some specimens of early man were canni- bals. Ardrey does not use this fact to prove that we all have a cannibalistic legacy. It is unfortunate that Ardrey has developed a faulty theory of instincts and a greatly oversimplified argu- ment to explain such complicated problems as juvenile delinquency ("the use of blackjack and bicycle chain may in adolescents be an unin- hibited expression of animal legacy") and war. Between australopithecus africanus and modern man the major evolutionary change is cranial capa- city, but Ardrey presents no infor- mation on animals with larger brains than man (elephants, whales, por- poises) and their unique behavior that removes man from the Illusion of Central Position. He reasserts the discredited Lockean concept of the tabula rasa and compares a modern child with a Chellean child of half a million years ago. There are pleasant sketches by Andrey's wife, and two vague charts in color. It would be helpful to have included the primate tree in the charts, as well as photographs.</page></plain_text>
