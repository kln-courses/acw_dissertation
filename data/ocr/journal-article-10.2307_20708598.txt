<plain_text><page sequence="1">John H. Lavely What is Personalism? Introduction It may seem a work of supererogation to some of you at least, to raise the question "What is personalism?" at a "Conference on Persons." I think not. I would, of course, grant that among those of you gathered for this conference, personalists may predominate. That is, personalists exceed in numbers other philosophical persuasions; though even that is not documented. It is less certain that personalists have a preponderance in influence, power or importance. We might want to reserve judgment on this until the end of the conference. Even so, even if no noisy minority of non-personalists should rise up to disturb and possibly disrupt our deliberations, it would not follow that posing the question "What is a personalist?" is beside the point. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that one could hardly expect this conference to produce a code or creed to which all personalists present would assent. Let us, therefore, confront and embrace what has been called the scandal of philosophy, namely, its diversity, its differences, its disagreements, these usually being taken prima facie as indication of failure or futility. Let it be for personalists the glory of philosophy that they keep open the quest for the truth, that they find satisfaction in contending together, that the desired outcome be found not in some codified unanimity but in the many-colored flame of persons in interaction, a flame to which each may give, from which each may gain. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 John H. Lavely There is another reason for asking this question. We may, in fact, long for agreement or consensus. But when we try to give it form it escapes us and we may end up disillusioned by its elusiveness. We may fantasize a shared truth (perhaps identified with our own conception) but when we try to realize it through, or in, social exchange, we find opposition and even bitter antagonism, much like the conflicts among siblings. Belonging to the same family or pro fessional society is no guarantee of likemindedness. We must not delude ourselves about the real differences that exist among philo sophical kin or bemoan this as undesirable. We are not, of course, faced with a choice of extremes between polarity or conformity. Or as Edgar S. Brightman put it, we do not have to accept either atomism (individualism) or organicism (col lectivism). We may be able to create a synthesis which defines the parameters of our differences and provides for the flexibility and openendedness of vital philosophizing. This would do honor to the tradition and at the same time advance our many understandings of the person. In these preliminary remarks, I am, therefore, trying to answer the question: Is this topic really necessary? In the first place, for those for whom personalism is not a household word, I want to define the personalistic perspective not as a circumscribed fixed doctrine, but as an approach to unfinished problems. And for those who consider themselves in some sense personalists, I only want to remind you of a German phrase which I heard uttered by Brightman many times: Philosophy, he would say, is "eine unen dliehe Aufgabe," that is, an unending task. This unfinished business has the advantage of keeping us all in the same race. Personalists and non-personalists alike must answer the same questions in order to answer the prime question, What Is Personalism? These questions, which I, as well as you, must attempt to answer are: I. Is Personalism merely a Cult (of Personality)? II. Is Personalism chiefly a Moral Philosophy (an Ethical Sys</page><page sequence="3">What is Personalism? 3 tern)? III. Is Personalism primarily a Theological Position? IV. Is Personalism a Theory of Reality (a Metaphysical System)? I. Is Personalism merely a Cult (of Personality)? The term "cult" is usually associated with religion. In a represen tative dictionary the first four definitions reflect this connection. For example, cult means "formal religious veneration" or "a system or religious beliefs and ritual," often "regarded as unorthodox or spurious." It is also used to designate "a system for the cure of disease based on dogma set forth by its promulgator." 1 It is clear that the application of the term in this sense (or these senses) to personalismos inappropriate or when intentionally applied is pejorative. It has to be admitted however that most adherents of personalism have had religious ties. Let us look briefly at the case of Borden Parker Bowne (1847-1910), who may be called the founding father of American personalism. Bowne was unwavering in his criticism of fundamentalism and dogmatic supernaturalism. It is worth noting that Bowne's teaching at Boston University School of Theology had a decisive influence in liberalizing the leadership of the Methodist Church, not to mention other Protestant clergy. Two of Bowne's students continued and developed his personalism in theological context at the School of Theology; they were Albert C. Knudson (1873-1953) and Edgar S. Brightman (1884-1953). I had the privilege first of studying under both Knudson and Brightman in the decade before their deaths and then joining them as a colleague in 1951. I can honestly say that I never saw any sign of theological commitments which qualified their consistently philosophical method. And yet, despite their common approach, despite their avowed personalism, Knudson and Brightman had sharply differ ent personalistic positions. Before we come to the end of this essay, we will see at least one other important illustration of philosophical difference and self-criticism within personalism. Whatever limita</page><page sequence="4">4 John H. Lavely tions personalism may have, slavish adherence to an authoritative position, religious or otherwise, is not one of them. We began this section by noting several meanings of the term "cult". We then noted that none of these meanings seems to apply to personalism. There is, however, another dictionary definition; it takes two forms. Cult means "5a: great devotion to a person, idea, or thing; esp : such devotion regarded as a literary or intellectual fad. 5b: a usually small circle of persons united by devotion or allegiance to an artistic or intellectual movement or figure."2 For personalism to fall under 5a, it would have to be considered a fad. A fad usually evinces "exaggerated zeal" for its beliefs or leaders and, perhaps because of this extravagance is usually short-lived. Personalism has certainly centered on Bowne and Brightman (and perhaps others) but whether an alleged zeal is any more exaggerated than the "devotion" shown to William James or John Dewey by pragmatiste is certainly doubtful. Nor does a small circle of adherents ideologically devoted to a fixed set of beliefs seem to fit personalism any more than it does pragmatism. Personalism became explicit in the early years of this century when Bowne consciously identified himself as "a Personalist", "the first of the clan in any thorough-going sense." A philosophical perspective, which within a few years will have maintained itself for a century, can hardly be called a fad or cult. Thus the persistence of personalism, along with the diversity within it, argues against the supposition that personalism is a doctrinaire or cult-like perspective. This conference supports this contention. That is, this is a con ference on persons, not personalism. It is the unspoken assumption of this conference that there is no canonical or codified view of "person". It does this by intentionally providing a forum for avowedly different stances among personalists. In addition to providing op portunity for internal self-criticism among personalists, it also invites external criticism from those who are not personalists. It is thus the point of the conference that we seek a better understanding of persons. The philosophical problem of persons</page><page sequence="5">What is Personalista? 5 cannot be squared with conceptual incest or provincial restrictions. Let the winds of doctrine blow and let the wings of truth fly free. II? Is Personalism chiefly a Moral Philosophy (an Ethical System)? There is what might be called a common-sense personalism, at least something to which the term personalism attaches among some who are not familiar with the tradition and apply the term to a position which suggests common-sense. This common-sense aspectis actually the attitude that personalism is a moral philosophy (or an ethical system). Some, who take this view, do not associate personalism with a metaphysical perspective, either because they are not f amiliar with personalism in that sense or because personalism has for them no intelligibility or credibility as a metaphysics and hence they identify it with a brand of ethics and indeed may confine it to the ethics the term evokes for them. Whether the above conception of personalism as merely a moral theory is a reflection of an anti-metaphysical perspective is difficult to say. If not, then this view (that is, an explicit reduction of personalism to its ethics) should be noted separately. For whatever reasons, however, when personalism is chiefly associated with its ethics, and whether this ascription is done explicitly or as an assumption not needing to be defended, such usage needs to be examined and not simply takes for granted. It is, of course, to be admitted that many personalists (perhaps most) do have an ethical system. And it may well be the case that some personalists are merely moralists and not metaphysical. I am argu ing, however, that personalism is not to be thought of as exclusively a moral philosophy. The later sections of this paper will provide sufficient warrant for the claim that personalism is more than an ethical system. I want to return now to the weaker, though positive and impor tant, claim thatmany, if not most, personalists are at least moralists. I am going to support this claim by citing two cases which I think will</page><page sequence="6">6 John H. Lavely show that personalism is at least a moral philosophy. To many, perhaps most of you, this may not seem like a very difficult undertaking. If not, I will try to avoid belaboring the point. Nevertheless, in building up a conception of personalism it is nec essary to show that personalism is a least a moral philosophy before proceeding to more difficult issues. Furthermore, the mere fact of being an ethical system may have implications or rest on presup positions which point beyond the ethical system itself. The first case of the place of moral philosophy in personalism is that of Edgar S. Brightman (1884-1953). His book, Mo ral Laws, was published in 1933. It is my conviction that this work deserves more attention than it has received in the nearly sixty years since its publication. I was influenced in this opinion by a remark made to me by my father, Horace T. Lavely, also a student of Brightman's; he said that in his judgment Brightman's philosophical stature would in the long run be based on the Moral Laws. I will try to give you some evidence for deciding whether my father's position has any cogency. Brightman begins by maintaining that ethics is the normative science which seeks "to discover and justify reasonable standards of conduct."3 Thus, according to Brightman, "ethics is the normative science of the principles (or laws) of the best types of human conduct". This definition, "implies three basic concepts in ethics, namely law (principles), value (the good), and obligation (ought, duty)". Brightman then proceeds to formulate a system of moral laws which will interpret and organize the whole realm of moral experience and hence guide the will in its choices. In the remainder of Moral Laws Brightman elucidates the eleven moral laws which comprise his system. He devotes a separate chapter to each law. Brightman's scheme cannot be lightly dismissed. It is not an a priori system derived from some non-moral principle (or prin ciples). There is not time to expound these laws. I will simply list the laws in Brightman's system. The laws are grouped under three headings as follows: I. The Formal Laws.</page><page sequence="7">What ? Personalism? 7 1. The Logical Law (consistent will). 2. The Law of Autonomy (self-imposed ideals are obliga tory). II. The Axiological Laws. 3. The Axiological Law (consistent values). 4. The Law of Consequences (consider and approve fore seeable consequences). 5. The Law of the Best Possible. 6. The Law of Specification (develop values relevant to the situation). 7. The Law of the Most Inclusive End. 8. The Law of Ideal Control (control empirical values by ideal values). III. The Personalistic Laws. 9. The Law of Individualism. 10. The Law of Altruism. 11. The Law of the Ideal of Personality (judge and guide all acts by an ideal of personality). (Moral Laws 88-90). It is clear that Brightman has attempted to combine coherently elements of different ethical theories in such a way as to interpret and integrate all moral experience. As instructive as it would be to follow Brightman's analysis and argument for these moral laws, both individually and as a system, it will be more to my purpose to show the impact or influence of Brightman's system on the ethical theories of other person a lists. Four of Brightman's students have incorporated and in different ways extended Brightman's "moral laws" in their ethical theories. They are Peter A. Bertocci (d. 1989), Richard M. Millard, Walter G. Muelder, and L. Harold DeWolf (d. 1986). Peter Bertocci (1910-1989) received the Ph.D. in Philosophy from Boston University in 1935 under Brightman. He taught at Boston University from 1945 until his retirement in 1975, from 1953 as the Borden Parker Bowne Professor of Philosophy. Among his many writings the one most relevant here is Personality and the Good: Psychohgical and Ethical Perspectives (1963) which he co</page><page sequence="8">8 John H. Lavely authored with Richard M. Millard, who received his Ph.D. under Brightman in 1950. Millard had major responsibility for writing Part IV of Personal ity and the Good.4 In part IV Millard develops ten "Principles of Ethical Choice". These ten moral principles parallel ten of Brightman's eleven moral laws. They follow Brightman's order and in nearly all cases use his names. There does not appear to be any explicit parallel for Brightman's "Law of Ideal Control", though its point may be incorporated without labeling. I should point out that this "appropriation" or "adopting" of Brightman's laws is intentional and acknowledged. Furthermore, Bertocci and Millard give a cogent explanation of their use of "principle" instead of "law" in the interpretation of the moral life. It should also be said that Bertocci and Millard introduce more concreteness and use helpful illustra tions in their elaboration of Brightman's laws and of personalistic ethics generally. Bertocci and Millard go beyond Brightman in their treatment of values as the context of the moral dimension. Their exposition of "A Symphony of Values" (in Ch. 15) and "A Scheme of Virtues" (in Ch. 17) adds greatly to the richness of ethical reflection as it bears on moral decision. I think it is fair to conclude that, although Bertocci and Millard show a great deal of freedom in their analysis and application of moral principles, their moral theory is essentially an elaboration and extension of Brightman's system of moral laws. Another student of Brightman's, Walter G. Meulder, carried on Brightman's moral laws and augmented them. Meulder received his Ph.D. in 1933 under Brightman and served as Dean of the School of Theology and Professor of Social Ethics at Boston University from 1945 to his retirement in 1972. To understand Meulder's version of the moral laws requires that we mention the late L. Harold DeWolf, who also received his Ph.D. under Brightman in 1935. According to Meulder, it was DeWolf who formulated three additional laws, which are grouped together as "communitarian laws" (Moral Law 51). The Law of Cooperation states "All persons</page><page sequence="9">What is Personalism? 9 ought as far as possible to cooperate with other persons in the production and enjoyment of shared values" (Moral Law 116). The Law of Social Devotion states: "All persons ought to devote themselves to serving the best interests of the group and to subordinate personal gain to social gain" (Moral Law 117). The Law of the Ideal of Community is: "All persons ought to form and choose all of their ideals and values in loyalty to their ideals (in harmony with the other Laws) of what the whole community ought to become; and to participate responsibly in groups to help them similarly choose and form all their ideals and choices" (Moral Law 119). It is clear that Meulder's acceptance and elaboration of these communitarian laws is an effort to give personalism an explicit social dimension. He writes that "my first impression was that personalism had a predominantly individualistic ethics" ("Edgar S. Brightman" 110). Meulder and DeWolf deserve credit for identifying personalism with a social as well as individual ethic. The communitarian laws reflect this development in personalistic ethical theory. In regard to our second question (Is Personalism chiefly a Moral Philosophy?), I conclude that the answer is negative. Personalism is not exclusively a moral philosophy. As I have shown, however, an ethical system does occupy a prominent place in personalism. This answer is nonetheless incomplete until we can introduce more than ethical elements in personalism. Let us turn then to our third question. III. Is Personalism primarily a Theological Position? It is intriguing that just as there are those who identify personal ism with a predominantly (if not exclusively) ethical position, there are others who associate personalism with a theological position. As in the former case (moral philosophy), personalism clearly stands in the dominant Western theological tradition. As I said in another place, "With the notable exception of J.M.E. MeTaggart's atheistic personalism (1866-1925), personalism in virtually all its forms has</page><page sequence="10">10 John H. Lavely been integrally connected with theism" ("Personalism" 107). Whether this makes it primarily a theological position remains to be seen. We must first of all distinguish two major forms of personalism: realistic personalism andidealistic personalism. Realistic personalism is essentially supernaturalism or traditional metaphysical realism. For this view, ultimate reality is supernatural being (or God). "There is also, however, a natural order of non-mental being, which although created by God, is not intrinsically spiritual or personal" (Lavely, "Personalism" 108). Realistic personalism is vigorously represented in Catholic or more generally in Neo-scholastic theo logical thought, which is having notable resurgence. We do not need to pursue realistic personalism further here because Boston personalism has its roots in idealism. But we need to be precise as to what this means. For one thing, although personalism owes much to Platonism and Kantianism5, neither provides a suffi cient basis for personalismos conception of God. Furthermore, personalism is to be distinguished from absolute idealism, for which things, human beings, and abstract entities (logical entities) are essentially part of the all-inclusive absolute mind. For personalism, on the contrary, God, the Supreme Person, creates finite persons. Personalism is thus a pluralistic idealism. Each finite person has an ontological identity of its own. Each person has a structure and function of its own, a will and history of its own. Reality is social, not isolated atomistic existence, but interaction among God and other persons. It may occur to some of you to ask: How is personalism to be distinguished from panpsychism? I have argued that "the affinities between and the common motifs of personalism and panpsychism are such that both positions have more at stake in reenforcing each other than in repudiating each other." For panpsychism, the un limited proliferation of psychic entities (or monads, to use Leibniz's term) is hard to square with the organic wholeness of the Supreme Monad in which/whom all being is fully realized. That is, there is an</page><page sequence="11">What ?5 Personalism? 11 unresolved tension between the point of view of the part and the point of view of the whole.6 For personalism, there are no non-personal beings; that is, "all being is either a personal experient (a complex unity of conscious ness) or some phase or aspect of one or more such experients"(Brightman, Person and Reality 135). Consequently person as the metaphysical model must cover the whole spectrum of beings from human beings to subhuman beings in one direction and to the Supreme Person in the other direction. Whether this avoids the tension in panpsychism, just mentioned above, remains to be seen. Perhaps it will help to clarify the issue if we look at the concept of God in personalism. This will incidentally bring us back to the question of this section: Is Personalism primarily a theological position? For personalism the only realities are God, the Supreme Person, and created persons. "Nature is viewed as the activity and expres sion of the cosmic person, not as a material substance created ex nihilo and existing separately" (or in its own right) (Lavely, "Person alism Supports" 31). However we may classify Martin Buber philo sophically, he puts the personalist view of Nature in a striking sentence. "The relation with man is the real simile of the relation with God; in it true address receives true response; except that in God's response everything^ the universe^ is made manifest as lan guage" (Buber, / and Thou 103). Now, does the centrality of the concept of God in the personalist metaphysical picture mean that personalism is primarily a theological position? It is quite apparent that personalism is at least a theological position. But whether the personalist position is primarily theologi cal depends on something eke. A philosophy which starts from an incorrigible religious premise or theological presupposition would, I think, be essentially a theological position. I do not wish to disparage those who base their claims to knowledge on an appeal to revelation. I am simply pointing out that in principle personalism is committed to considering all the available and relevant evidence and</page><page sequence="12">12 John H. Lavely to formulating the most coherent interpretation of the evidence. Even this will provide at best only a tentative hypothesis subject to testing in practice. That is, it will be subject to criticism, correction, modification in the light of new or neglected experience (not just sense experience but value experience as well) and in the light of more adequate theories. Such criteria are all the more important when the problems have to do with the whole range of experience both sense perception and value dimensions. Such a method neither starts with absolutes nor ends with theoretical certainty. Such a method does, however, provide for a fruitful, open ended, and cooperative process. However important the concept of God may be to personalism, it is not self-authenticating nor does it have privileged status. The concept of God is open to continuing scrutiny. In fact, just because of the importance of "divine language" (to use Buber's idiom in the quotation above), translation thereof never ends. Consider the presumption of holding that God will never have anything more to say than what has been exhaustively disclosed in a particular historical time under specific circumstances. On the contrary, is it not because of their place in a context with the many connections that religious events get their powers? It is my tentative conclusion, therefore, that personalism gets whatever truth-value it possesses not from a self-validating theological position but in so far as it articulates a religious dimension in the total field of our experience, in so far as it weaves the full wealth of particulars into the fabric of expanding meaning and coherence. We come, then to the fourth question. IV. Is Personalism a Theory of Reality (a Metaphysical System)? You will notice that this last question does not have a qualifying adverb as do the previous questions. Of course, there is more than the adverbial difference between the above question and the first three questions. The key to the difference is the comprehensiveness</page><page sequence="13">What is Personalism? 13 and ultimacy of a metaphysical system. A moral philosophy circum scribes its subject matter even though it may acknowledge non moral subject-matter. For metaphysics there is no circumscribed subject matter, no subject matter foreign to its concern. Likewise a theology is often (perhaps usually) restricted by its choice of what subject matter counts whereas metaphysics cannot make any pre suppositions about favored nature status. Metaphysics is the science of horizons (that is, "apparent horizons" or unlimited horizons). Thus a theory of reality supersedes any distinction between moral and natural philosophy or between revealed theology and natural theology. This concept of metaphysics needs to be developed and defended in two respects. First, some further justification of what is envisaged by speaking of a theory of reality in this sense. Second, some consideration of how the concept of the person fares under these conditions. I am presuming to deal with these by using personalism as a test case. When I speak of personalism I will mean Boston personalism (or even Brightman's personalism) of which I am a product and for which I am an apologist.7 Perhaps I can clarify my approach by citing a brief passage from a wonderful book of spiritual resources, Gates of Prayer: The New Union Prayer Book (published by the Central Conference of Ameri can Rabbis in 1975). It reads: "The description of God as a Person is indispensable for everyone who like myself means by 'God9 not a principle... and not an idea.. .but who rather means by 'God', as I do, Him who ? whatever else He may be ? enters in a direct relation with us in creative, revealing and redeeming acts, and thus makes it possible for us to enter into a direct relation with Him...The concept of personal being is indeed completely incapable of declaring what God's essential being is, but it is both permitted and necessary to say that God is also a Personali). I wonder how many of you share feelings of ambivalence on hearing (or reading) this quotation? To begin with, God is a Person (the male person is used) with whom 'direct relation' is possible. But</page><page sequence="14">14 John H. Lavely then God's personal beingis said to be peripheral to "God's essential being"; God's personal being in no way illuminates God's essential being. Such a description seems to me to be a travesty on the concept of a personal God. What does "essential being" add to personal being? In order to pursue the metaphysical question further, I will focus on Brightman's position as the most integral version of the Boston tradition. Andrew Reck seems to share my view in his Recent American Philosophy. Reck gives this appraisal: "Brightman's role has been that of the creative thinker who has imparted to personalism systematic coherence, empirical inclusiveness, and conceptual originality of the first order" (Reck 312). For Brightman the term person refers to the ultimate and irre ducible unit of reality and the concept of person is thus pivotal and crucial. As we have seen personalism is the theory "everything that exists (or subsists) is in, of, or for a mind on some level" (Person and Reality 135). Brightman's position is thus a member of the family of metaphysical perspectives known as idealism. It is, however, reso lutely pluralistic: reality is a society or community of persons. As such, it is not to be confused with the absolute idealism of thinkers like Hegel and Royce, for whom reality is Absolute Mind or Spirit and for whom, therefore, finite (human) persons are differentiations within the Absolute. Brightman's view is also to be distinguished from the panpsychisms of Leibniz and Whitehead: the gradation of monads in Leibniz and the proliferation of actual entities in Whitehead diffuse or strain the notion of personal mind as Brightman under stood it. Nor is personalism to be identified with Hartshorne's panentheism, "the view," in Hartshorne's words, "that all things are within the being of God, who yet is not merely the whole of actual things" ("Panentheism" 557). For Brightman such a view jeopar dized the ontological independence of finite (human) persons. Nev ertheless, the differences I have noted should not lead us to ignore the affinities personalism has with these other idealisms. We can't go much further in characterizing Brightman's per</page><page sequence="15">What is Personalism? 15 sonalism without noting that it is theistic: the ultimate and uncreated Person is God, the ground of all being, the creator of finite (human) persons, and the source and sustainer of values. Brightman's theism must be clearly distinguished from orthodox theism (theological dualism). For Brightman, God is not a supernatural being who creates the natural order ex nihilo. Insuperable metaphysical prob lems about the relation (dichotomy) between a perfect, unchanging, timeless, supernatural being and an imperfect, changing, temporal world vitiated the intelligibility of supernaturalism. The natural world does not have ontological identity "outside" the ultimate Person; rather this order is God's "behavior" or epiphany. This view does not mean that Nature is identical with God; nor does it mean that Nature does not exist. It means that the physical world is not an independent substantial reality. Nature exists as a partial manifestation of the divine Person. Nature is thus a name for the form in which God's activity is accessible to use in sense experience. Such a view of Nature does not commit personalism to pantheism. Brightman repudiates creation of Nature ex nihilo, but he shares with traditional theists a doctrine of the creation of persons.8 Although finite (human) persons depend on God's creative activity for coming into being and on the divine order of control for condi tions which sustain their being, they are genuine centers of being; that is, they are free, which is to say that their existence requires their response. A created person is something new in the universe. Persons do not pre-exist as such in God. They really come into being even though they come out of God's being. Since a created person is the same kind of being (in personhood) as God, this conception of creation is intelligible. Even so creation is a miracle; that is, there is no analogy for it. The evolutionary process may, however, be viewed as representing the conditions under which God has brought this miracle to pass. The motive for creation on this view is love. God was lonely and desired to have others with whom to share the tasks and the achievements of the creative enterprise. Schiller expresses this poetically: "Friendless was the great Lord of the Universe. He felt</page><page sequence="16">16 John H. Lavely something was lacking, therefore, He created minds_ That God is uncreated is not an inference from the personal model but an interpretation of the fact that human persons are finite and dependent. The principle, ex nihilo nihil fit, enables us to move to infinite, independent, uncreated reality, while the personal analogy is the warrant for the holding that said reality is personal. If human persons "encounter" reality, if response and reciprocity are essential to this encounter, then neither side can be swallowed up by the other. Yet if one is finite, the other must have created it. In short, theists cannot preserve the experience of otherness and genuine relation ship, the plurality of existence and the personal analogy, except in terms of a doctrine of creation. We do not get divine personality (thou-being) by first sifting off Nature and calling the remainder Spirit (or super-Nature). Nor do we get divine personality by treating human beings as fractions which add up to one Thou (the All-One). A human person is an existing center of being. A human person's experience of reality, religiously interpreted, can only be expressed as relationship or transaction between and with another person. "The religious value," for Brightman, "is experienced as a relation of the human individual to the Divine" (A Philosophy of Religion 131). The quality of such experience is analogous to, though far exceeding in intensity and inclusi ven ess, meeting another human person. On this basis, the totality of our Ufe should be relationship, which is another way of saying that there is no reality other than persons. A person is thus a thou kind of being and God is the supreme Person, the ultimate and uncreated Thou. Most of Brightman's departures from traditional theism (that is, supernaturalism) are the result of his effort to take personality seriously as the basic explanatory model. If God is personal, God is omnitemporal, not timeless. That is, as personalists we must accept a temporalist view of God. Brightman also argued that the traditional conception of divine omnipotence could not be maintained without seriously qualifying the divine goodness. His consideration of the</page><page sequence="17">What is Personalism? 17 problem of evil led him to the controversial conclusion that the will (or power) of God is limited by nonrational conditions ("the Given") within the divine ature which that will neither creates nor approves. God maintains constant and increasing, though never complete, control of the Given. For Brightman, then, religion normatively is cooperation of human persons and God in the solution of common problems and realization of shared values. We can now explore further the personalistic concept of person. Let me concede that personalism is openly anthropomorphic. Far from seeking to disguise this fact, personalists flaunt the personal model before the world boldly and unashamedly. As some of their critics say, they build a metaphysics on the truism of the egocentric predicament, thus making a virtue of necessity. People complain of unmitigated anthropomorphism in the same tone as they speak of unmitigated gall. Brightman's anthropomorphism shows up in many ways. Let me give you a trivial example of one of his quips: "There's nothing forbidden in the Old Testament which hadn't been tried." More generically it shows up in (or perhaps it would be better to say, it is based on) his analysis of the self. Brightman defines a person as "a complex unity of consciousness, which identifies itself with its past self in memory, determines itself by its freedom, is purposive and value-seeking, private yet communicating, and potentially rational" ("Personalism" 350). Let me single out for attention two of the pervasive traits of personal experience. One is privacy: experience is always "first personal"; that is, "every item of consciousness is owned...; there are no floating experiences" (Brightman, A Philosophy of Religion 351). Experience always belongs to someone's field of experience or, as I call it, the subjective continuum. As the Bible has it, "what person knows a man's thoughts except the spirit of the man which is in him" (I Corinthians 2:11 RSV). Each of us smokes reality, if we do, through the filter of his/her own experience. We now have a bordered self, but what are the borders? If privacy</page><page sequence="18">18 John H. Lavely means that "the monads have no windows" (Leibniz), perhaps we begin and end not merely with anthropomorphism but with solipsism. For Brightman, there is another pervasive trait, which saves the self from solipsism, namely, self-transcendence, a term which Brightman used before the phenomenological term "intentionality" had come into wide currency. Experience always refers beyond itself. Con sciousness is always of something. Each present moment is in effect saying to itself: there's more to it than this. That is, more than the present self is needed to explain the present self. Thus experience is an indicator, reflecting transaction with its environment. The initial differentiation expressing this trait is that between the given (what Kant calls the faculty of receptivity: "the capacity of receiving representations") and the taking (what Kant calls the faculty of spontaneity: "the power of knowing an object through these rep resentations") (Kant A50/B74; 92). Brightman would almost certainly adduce Hegel's dialectic in elucidating this intrinsic feature of personal experience. As such, self-transcendence is the most im portant trait: it expresses the unifying function of the subjective continuum by building up internal connections and it solves the problem of privacy (without denying the fact) by establishing external relations. It is the executive of both domestic and foreign affairs. Thus we start with privacy and end with relationship. Whatever I may think of the details of his analysis of the self or person, I am one with Brightman in being an unregenerate an thropomorphic. ReUgion,fromXenophanes to Feuerbach, has been accused of anthropomorphism?in the interest of some better an thropomorphism. What is not as widely appreciated is that science is also inescapably anthropomorphic. Knowledge is person depen dent, a function of persons. As Kant says, "We can know a priori of things only what we ourselves put into them" (A50/B74; 92). If so, a non-human point of view is not open to us. No ecstasy enables us to step outside the human condition. Now ontological idealism does not automatically follow from the egocentric predicament, as Ralph Barton Perry clearly shows in his</page><page sequence="19">What ?5 Personalism? 19 famous article, "The Egocentric Predicament"10 early in this cen tury. Nor does it follow, as Perry tried to maintain, that, since a knower is always a factor in cognitive relation to a thing or object, we can simply discount that fact and somehow analyze the thing as though we had access to it (that is, knowledge of it) independent of the cognitive relation. The privacy of experience is not an episte mological ring of Gyges that can be turned around at will. Not many contemporary philosophers do epistemology in Brightman's style. Some have, I think, already conceded that we are trapped in our subjectivity and have no way to escape relativism, historicism, skepticism, and the like. Others seem to assume the trans-human objectivity of some order of being whether logical, physical, mental, or theological as though it were not even as assumption. In the face of myth, ideology, unconscious projection, we need a reductio ad hominem, an exercise in self-awareness and acceptance of our humanness. Most of us are familiar with the naturalistic fallacy of deriving the ought from the ?s. I have invented a new fallacy, which is a fallacy only if you don't realize you are committing it. For the personalistic fallacy, every is is also an ought. That is, intentionally is intrinsic to every field of experience. Thus, all knowledge is human project, unavoidably expressing human interests and problems. Whether such human project can enable us to come to terms with the universe depends on closer examination of reason. Pending that, I draw two conclusions from the person-dependent character of our knowledge. First, all human knowledge is tentative, no knowledge is incorrigible. Therefore, the anthropomorphic theme has to be balanced by an agnostic theme. Second, the process of knowing must be understood asafunction, an achievement, of centers ofbeing. Hence, atthevery least this is a pluralistic universe. The most important area in which Brightman's avowed anthro pomorphism operates is in his use of the personal model or analogy as the basis for his hypothesis about the existence and nature of God as a person. Brightman argued that "since all of the actual data</page><page sequence="20">20 John H. Lavely empirically available are conscious experiences, all that is inferred from those data must be consistent with and explanatory of con scious experience" (Philosophy 227). He then proceeded to argue that the metaphysical hypothesis of a personal God provides the most adequate (coherent) explanation of these data and all that we believe on the basis of them. In his presidential address to the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association in 1936, entitled "An Empirical Approach to God", Brightman elaborated this hypothesis impressively. The core of the argument is an ex trapolation from the personal analogy. He writes: "all experients and all entities, as far as we know or imagine, have three properties, which we shall call action, content, and form" (Muelder et al, Development 317). He states it as an empirical hypothesis that a person is "an actual complex of awareness" (Muelder et al, Devel opment 317). He then maintains that not only "every moment of actual experience" but also "every concrete real object to which our experience can refer, is a complex which can be analyzed" into the same three factors: activity, form, and content (Brightman, Phi losophy 319-320). These factors parallel respectively Plato's demiurge, Ideas, and receptacle of becoming, except that for Brightman these are integral aspects of the complex unity of a cosmic person. Thus Brightman concludes: "If God is the supreme experient, his content would include awareness of all qualities in the universe; his form would include all possible relations; and his activity would select from among the qualities those of ideal value and would direct the cosmic process toward their realization" (Muelder et al, Devel opment 318). Brightman pressed the personal analogy consistently and drew the conclusions resolutely, so much so that he introduced a radical modification of traditional theism: God was limited by given (nonrational) aspects of his nature which his will neither creates nor approves. Nevertheless, God's will can use and does control the Given. This conception he called theistic finitism. It is somewhat misleading to speak of this as a finite God, since God is still omnipotent in the sense of having all the power there is (except that</page><page sequence="21">What is Personalism? 21 which God delegates to free beings in creation). The point for Brightman is that God's power (or will or activity) is not all of his being. I come now to some problems I have with Brightman's concept of person and his use of it. Brightman identifies person with conscious experience not only phenomenologically but also ontologically. As a result person turns out to be equated with mind in a roughly Cartesian sense. I have heard Brightman insist emphatically that a person's body is no part of his mind. I think it is clear, therefore, that for Brightman a person's real being is exhaustively identified with mind and that the body is an external environment on which the mind intimately depends.11 For years I sided with Peter Bertocci in following Brightman's essential definition of person as not including the body, in contrast to Harold DeWolf, who argued for a body-mind continuum. I have since come to think that person refers to an ontological identity which somehow encompasses body and mind in one reality. Body and mind are thus both abstractions, partial differentiations of a more fundamental reality. It is to this more fundamental reality that I apply the term person. I see no reason why an identity of mind and body cannot be adapted to personalistic uses. This issue is related to another problem I find with Brightman's concept of person, namely, a certain asymmetry between divine person and human person. I am not denying that there are differ ences between human and divine personality.12 The divine person is uncreated and creates other persons, in both respects being a unique person. But Brightman also says "the divine person has, in contrast with man, no body and especially no nervous system" (Philosophy 366). We have just seen that a human person is in external relations to his/her body. What Brightman means in the above quotation is clearly that God is not dependent on or in external relations to some nonpersonal order of being. What is overlooked is that the entire natural order (what on the human level is analogous to the body) is an objectification of the divine activity and is a dimension within</page><page sequence="22">22 John H. Lavely God. We thus have the following anomaly: the human person (being really nonspatial mind) is more spiritual than God, who is in some sense the unity or identity of nature and spirit (or body and mind). Not only the temporal but also the spatial is an intrinsic dimension of the divine person. In this sense it is quite legitimate to speak of nature as God's body or behavior, provided it is not viewed as external to the divine being. In my opinion, this conception of God is a more adequate concept of person than is that of Brightman's conception of human person. The conception of the latter should, therefore, as I suggested above, be modified to make it more like that of the divine person. If so, it would also give a better account of spatial order, an order which has created problems for most ideal ists. This change would probably bring personalism, for better or worse, closer to panpsychism or panentheism (process theology generally). In short, we have here a project for the elaboration of the personal model and possibly for rapprochement with kindred meta physical positions. The third problem I have with Brightman's concept of person has to do with the place of desire vis a vis will. Since, in my mind, this question implicates Brightman's concept of reason (and values) and since this question is deeply effected by consideration of one further problem, I will defer it until the later treatment of reason. The last and most serious problem I want to raise brings into question the very availability for metaphysical purposes of the concept of person, or, in Kantian language, its possibility. I came upon this difficulty years ago in trying to work out the conditions which would make it possible to have a metaphysical position or any defensible world view. I saw that the only point at which I had direct first-hand access to reality (something real) was my own existing, reality in my case. I saw, too, that the primary, and possibly the only, root-metaphor, analogy, or model I had available for under standing other reality (building up a world hypothesis) was person, meaning by "person" here simply the something existing in me. I recalled a Master's thesis on "Hegel's Conception of Philosophy",</page><page sequence="23">What is Personalism? 23 written by a graduate student at Boston University at the time. In it, he made the point that Hegel had shown that if one wanted to be a metaphysician he/she had to be an idealist. One does not have to be a metaphysician, but if he/she is to be a metaphysician, spirit, mind, person is the unavoidable model. But even if one accepts this premise (namely, that person is inescapable model), I began to see a common difficulty: thinkers who purported to use this model came up with very different views of reality. I suddenly saw that I would have to take much more seriously Descartes' question, "What then am I, I who am certain that I am?" (Meditations, Bk II). than he did. I clearly am myself?whatever that is. I am myself but can I know myself? I at last came to the alarming and, for a personalist, embarrassing conclusion that though person is unavoidable it is somehow ineluctable. It is the fish no net can catch. Or, to use another metaphor, we never see that which casts the shadow. Perhaps we can never know that which we need to know to know anything else. Mystery, thy name is person. I wish I knew a simple way to resolve this paradox of the person. Endlessly elusive, but constantly exposed; hidden, yet revealed; inexhaustible and yet obvious. One moment we anticipate exactly what an intimate friend or lover will do or say; the next moment he/ she will be an utterly baffling enigma. Perhaps the best we can do is what I might call negative anthropology: Know not thyself, Know what thyself is not But even to say "Man Is Not a Thing", to quote the title of an article by the late Erich Fromm, is also to say something positive. The locution, "the nothing within," can be interpreted to mean "the no thing which has a life of its own" or which knows itself as being in its own right. So also the Buddhists speak of emptiness (rau, in Japa nese), a depth content not to be confused with or cluttered with any surface forms (Erfahrungen) or concepts. I agree that, if one isolates the "inward X" or tries to find it by itself, it is nothing at all. And I think there is a reason why it is nothing at all as such. I think the</page><page sequence="24">24 John H. Lavely nothing within does not want to be just by itself. Some of you know the story of Washoe, the chimpanzee who has been trained to use sign language. Washoe was so remarkable that psychologists and other experts came from all over to observe the performance. Whenever a visitor would come, however, Washoe always gave the sign for "Let me out." The nothing within is in a sense always giving the sign "Let me out." Without sign language, tools, mathematics, arts, etc., the nothing within remains a permanent captive in a forgotten dungeon. W.H. Auden once said, "How can I know that I think until I see what I say?" So, how can I know what's inside me till I see what I wrote? As John Donne puts it in "Ecclogue": "To know and feel all this and not to have Words to express it, makes a man a grave Of his owne thoughts." Whitehead writes, "Expression is the one fundamental sacrament. It is the outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace" (Religion 127). Let us substitute "Erfahrungen" for "Expression" and "Erlebnis" for "grace" in this quotation. The story of Erlebnis cannot be told except in the history of its Erfahrungen. If so, person can no more be reduced to its expressions than it can be to pure erlebt experience. The attempt to isolate the Erlebnis as such, is matched by the perennial danger of identifying the human merely with its Erfahrungen. Idolatry, alienation, dehumanization result. I think we ought not to forget that the term person comes from the Latin persona, meaning mask and/or actor. It is easy to identify a person with his/her role, with the configuration of his/her per sonality. I think it is Rilke who talks about faces as masks. He imagines removing one's face and finding that, faceless, he or she was nothing, not in the sense of the nothing within but in the sense that he or she is only a mask. The real problem, however, is not that the real person is either Erlebnis or Erfahrungen alone. Just as a person is not either mind or body but encompasses both, so the paradox of person is the ambiguity and the mystery of the complex or continuum of Erlebnis</page><page sequence="25">What is Personalista? 25 (inner experience) and Erfahrung (manifest or objectified form). For me it is still Hegel who grasps most adequately and interprets most intelligibly the paradox of person. In the dialectic of spirit (person), infinite content (Erlebnis) and finite form (Erfahrung) are concretely interpendent. Separate, each is utterly abstract. AU forms are limited expressions of the infinite content. No forms will ever exhaust the inexhaustible content but without some form the content is nothing. Rationality is a function of the unity of form and content in the whole person. The experience of the irrational is or results from the dissociation of or discontinuity between the two. It is still necessary to carry our discussion one step further to round out personalism as I understand it. I am referring to the importance of the principle of coherence. The concept of coherence bulks very large in Brightman's per sonalism. Coherence is the criterion of truth. Reason is defined as "a logically consistent and coherent method of interpreting experience" (Philosophy 536). Coherence is also a universal principle of value. "True value would be a fully coherent fulfilled desire for a fully coherent object" (Philosophy 252).13 Bertocci has highlighted an important feature of Brightman's view of coherence by speaking of "growing empirical coherence." The point is worth emphasizing: coherence is a principle for interpreting experience. The power this principle had for Brightman can be seen in the fact that his "argument" for God consisted in the hypothesis that a personal God provides the most coherent interpretation of all the available evidence; it gives the most adequate explanation of all the facts of experience taken synoptically. Brightman recognized that appealing to or claiming coherence is not as such an argument. Coherence has to be shown. In my opinion, one of the more neglected ways in which Brightman sought to show the coherence of this hypothesis (re God) is what he called the dialectic of desire. Dialec tic, "the mind's search for completeness and coherence" finds its culmination in desire for the Supreme Person (Philosophy251-257). The dialectic of desire might, I think, be interpreted as a dynamic,</page><page sequence="26">26 John H. Lavely non-demonstrative version of the ontological argument. Although much more could be said in elucidating the concept of coherence as it functions for Brightman, I want to raise some questions about coherence, which may, I hope, help to bring out the source and limits of its power?because I do think it is a powerful principle. First of all, I can remember thinking years and years ago that Brightman used coherence to justify everything else but I wasn't clear as to how he justified coherence. Or to put the question another way (since coherence was the essence of reason): what was the ground of rationality? For a philosopher who staked everything on being empirical, what was the empirical basis of coherence? Unless Brightman simply assumed the Hegelian dialectic, I didn't really see any phenomenological derivation of coherence. I could see that coherence was closely connected with desire, since for Brightman all value was generically satisfaction of desire and coherence was somehow the highest value (at least as the principle of truth); but what was the connection? In his analysis of the self, will (activity, purpose) clearly took precedence over desire, since will was one of the three constitutive aspects of person (the other two being rational form and non-rational content) and desire was not mentioned per se. The ambiguity here seemed to me similar to one in Sartre: man is manquer (to lack) but at the same time "there is no difference between being man and being free" (61). (Compare Augustine: "Omness nihil aliud quam voluntas sunt;" that is, all men are nothing else than will.) It occurred to me that if reason is a method for achieving coherence it must presuppose a need or desire for coherence. If purposive activity was the effort to achieve coherence, then it presupposed a need or desire for coherence. If so, then desire is the prior existential condition without which neither reason nor will is intelligible. Take logic, which even for Brightman appeared to have a priori finality which nothing in this world or the next could qualify, as a test case. Although he seemed to subordinate it to coherence (consistency being only a necessary condition for truth), logic nonetheless ap</page><page sequence="27">What is Personalism? 27 peared to be an independent, if not absolute, principle. To me, however, logic seems to be a form of coherence. Logic is a human achievement dependent for its sanction on the order it introduces into thinking and communicating. The law of Identity (A is A) is thus a human resolution which gets its force from the minimum level of coherence it formulates. It is normative; if one wants a coherent life, then he/she ought to be logical or consistent. In short, logic was made by and for persons in response to a need for order in thinking. Reflections like these forced me to the conclusion that desire is the ground of human being. Freedom, creativity, purpose, all are born in the endeavor to satisfy desire, in seeking to fill the emptiness, which by itself is the "nothing within". I know many people find desire a disturbing concept. Die Lust rears its ugly head for some. For others the specter of instinct appears. Psychological determinism may be suspected. Or the pessimism of Schopenhauer threatens, since desire can never be completely satisfied. But why take a negative attitude toward that without which no future satisfaction would be possible? At any rate, I wish I could do more with the etymology of desire than to trace it to the Latin desiderare, with its components de and sider (star). For some reason this suggests to me these words of Zarathustra: "I say unto you: One must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star. I say unto you: you still have chaos in yourselves" (129). Suppose then, that desire is fundamental in human nature. Desire for what? There is no way to tell ahead of time. Desire does not tell us what will satisfy. Everything we know about the meeting of need, the overcoming of lack, is a posteriori, after the fact. We cannot even be sure that desire can or will be satisfied. This means that every act is a risk, frought with the danger that our desire will be frustrated, not fulfilled. Hence, human endeavor is a willingness to make mistakes. It is resistance to the generic fear that action might not bring success, satisfaction, or even survival. In fact, the last act in extreme cases is the catatonic paralysis that reflects the refusal to act for fear desire might be thwarted. Curiosity and adventure are</page><page sequence="28">28 John H. Lavely important signals of human response just as fear of change reflects fixation of desire on some familiar satisfaction or meaning. So we can only find out in retrospect what fulfills or frustrates. If so, what do we find out afterwards about desire? Often, we catalogue types of satisfaction (values) and attribute them to a corresponding set of desires. This seems to me like setting a number of actors on a stage without giving them a scenario. I want to propose something very different as a theory of desire. I remind you that a theory of desire presupposes the continuum of (a) desire, (b) effort, purpose, or activity, and (c) the achievements/failures with their resulting values/disvalues. Before I spell out this proposal explicitly, let me suggest what led me to entertain and then to take it very seriously. I was struck by what I will call the unity motif; perhaps unifying would be better. In the Charmides, speaking of physicians, Socrates says, "the part can never be well unless the whole is well." And in the Gorgias: "The artist disposes all things in order and compels the one part to harmonize and accord with the other part, until he has constructed a regular and systematic whole." The expitome of the motif is certainly Hegel's "the True is the Whole." For him, the history of self-formation, concept-formation, culture-formation is seen in needing, seeking, realizing wholeness. To be abstract is to be out of connections and that is bad. The dialectic may differentiate itself endlessly and even distort itself but it is still the same dialectic with its search for the concrete universal. Even Kant speaks of the "restless endeavor" of reason which leads the metaphysician to seek the highest unity in Ideas, (Soul, World, God) even though they are strictly beyond knowledge. Coherence (etymologically, sticking together) is a form of this unity motif. It is not merely a sophisticated or technical philosophi cal principle. Coherence and/or the unity motif are present in ordinary Ufe, prereflective experience. We say, "Something doesn't fit." Or "I've got to get my head together." We don't feel at home unless we have a familiar context. We hang on for dear Ufe to what makes sense to us. One perception is an illusion (did I say allusion?)</page><page sequence="29">What ?s Personalism? 29 but two perceptions is a thing. Three perceptions and we construct a law of nature: It will always drop?how reliable! Four perceptions is enough to disclose ultimate reality. Five perceptions is reunion with the One. We need not proliferate illustrations. Consider for yourself the function which myth, language, institutions perform and the judgment on them if the order and organization they provide breaks down. Let me test this motif in the sphere of the higher human values. First, morality. What is character but coherence between my ideals and my actions? Bertocci considered the feeling of obligation an irreducible moral datum. I disagree: I think the feeling of obligation can be analyzed as the feeling that I ought to make my actions coherent with my ideals. This feeling seems to me to presuppose a desire for a unified life. I ought to act in accord with my beliefs if I want a unified life. If there is discord between my ideals and what I did, remorse or regret result. I have earlier interpreted logic as a system of coherence in meanings, concepts, and the like. In science we have a synthesis of abstract thought (i.e., mathematics) and sense perception. Scientific knowledge is a joint product, a unity of form (reason) and content (sense). Kant speaks of "modes of knowledge which must have their origin a priori, and which perhaps serve only to give coherence to our sense-representations" (A2:42). Art provides a variation on the unity of form and content, on the theme of harmony, and on the coherence of aim and attainment. Religion in this idiom is coherent relation to the reality without which (or whom) a person wouldn't seek or find any coherence. Buber says, "in religious reality the person has concentrated himself into a whole, for it is only as a unified being that he is able to live religiously" (Eclipse 44). A.C. Bouquet puts it more simply: "The essential function of religion is to integrate life" (13). The primacy of religious value thus seems to be predicated on the normative principle that maximum fulfillment is maximum wholeness and such that wholeness contributes to and is fostered by relationship to reality. Internal coherence and external relatedness are coordinates for the religious</page><page sequence="30">30 John H. Lavely life. The same thing might well be said by someone arguing for the primacy of some other value. To me the almost irresistible conclusion from this kind of evidence is simply this: Person is a matrix of a singh basic desire, which I prefer to call a desire for coherence. It can, however, just as well be spoken of as a desire for wholeness, order, harmony, integration, or any one of a number of kindred terms. It is essential to remember that we do not know a priori that a person is existentially a desire for coherence. It turns out that fulfillment is a function of some achieved wholeness, that satisfaction is a function of some actual order, that value results from coherence. As Plato puts it, the tyrant is the most unhappy of men. It must also be kept in mind that desire for coherence can never be exhausted in or identified with any particular symbol, system, order, no matter how much meaning it may at the time have. It should be apparent by now why I agree with Brightman about the power of the concept of coherence. For me that power is rooted in the nature of person. Coherence is not to be equated with reason or rationality. Rather reason or rationality is a specification of coherence and like coherence finds its foundation and sanction in the nature of person. Conclusion In conclusion, I want to make three brief comments. 1. I have been trying to provide both an assessment and an appreciation of personalism. I hope you will find the assessment illuminating and not merely critical. I trust that you will find the appreciation honest and not merely self-serving. 2. I want to remind you of the difference between personalism as a theory about persons and persons as existing entities. Every theory about persons is artificial in the sense that it is contrived by persons for persons; that is, in language that is rapidly becoming obsolete, every theory is man-made. A personalistic theory is thus temporary;</page><page sequence="31">What is Personalista? 31 that is, time-conditioned and hence replaceable. If persons are of primary importance, then personalisms are also important, but secondary. 3. Most of you have doubtless heard the verse of the psalmist: "What is man that thou art mindful of him?" (Psalm 8:4a; RSV). Let me secularize this verse: What are persons that we should be concerned about them? What kind of being is a person? This is the question ve been struggling with. This is the question you also will struggle with in your own way.
