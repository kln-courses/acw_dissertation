<plain_text><page sequence="1">[43] ON SWEARING AN ACCOUNT OF SOME JUDICIAL OATHS IN NORTHERN NIGERIA A. H. M. KIRK-GREENE ONE of the Lecturers at the University College of Ibadan recently declared that a vital and often neglected source of information for the would-be anthropo- logist was the tribal court records. Here, written down with the ingenuous casualness of banality, is a treasure-trove of tribal lore and law, superstitions and suppositions, which can provide the anthropologically minded student with hours of absorbing, and sometimes original, research work. How often do we pause to consider what is entailed in the typical verdict entered in the tribal court book ? Audu he makes the complaint of Muhammadu, he says he stole two goats and a calabash of groundnuts. The elders of the court they say: do you hear what he has said ? Muhammadu he answers, he says: I hear, it is a lie. The elders of the court they say, since it has not been proved before us let the oath be taken. Verdict: swearing. (Hukumci: rantsuwa.) If we have thought at all about how the sentence of the court is put into effect, we may not perhaps have proceeded beyond the vague image in the memory of a Gilbert and Sullivan constable, ham-fist on Bible, standing before His Wusship and galloping through a monstrous mumbo-jumbo-all in one breath-that ends with an impreca- tion sounding like' swelp-me-Gawd '. Yet, for all our nebulousness, of the validity and the binding quality of the tribal oath registered in the court-records we have no doubt. This article deals briefly with some of the principal oaths recently or still current in pagan siyasa (tribal courts) in the Adamawa Province of Northern Nigeria, with particular reference to those used among the peoples of the Trusteeship Territory contained in the north-east of that Province. The gradual spread of Moslem and Mis- sion influences, coupled with the fragmentatory detribalization consequent upon contact with the world outside the tribal area, has inevitably led to modification and even abolition of several customary tribal oaths; but apart from those that have been prohibited as being repugnant to natural justice and equity, many interesting and valuable oaths exist today, whose influence in keeping the peace and settling litiga- tion is remarkable. In Notes and Queries on Anthropology (revised edition, I95 ) we find two definitions that will serve us admirably as a background: an oath is 'an invocation to a super- natural being or agency; punishment for an infringement of an oath falls automati- cally', while an ordeal is 'a method of invoking the aid of supernatural powers to settle disputes or to test the truth of an accusation; it usually consists of severe and possibly dangerous tests to which the parties to the dispute are subjected '. Both oaths and ordeals have been widespread, historically as well as geographically, and a glance</page><page sequence="2">44 ON SWEARING at some of the main features would not be out of place here. The simplest form of oath is of the type practised by the Naga of Assam, where two litigants will seize a dog or fowl by its head and feet and then cut it in two with a single stroke of a matchet: this symbolizes the fate awaiting him who swears falsely. From this symbolism we pro- gress to the embodied oath, that is an oath in which the swearer swears on or by an object supposedly endowed with omnipotent qualities. The Iowa Indians, for instance, possess a holy iron, wrapped in seven skins, on which men take the oath, and in Samoa the accused lays his hand on the sacred stone of the village and declares: ' If I stole the thing, may I speedily die.' Hannibal's celebrated vow against Rome was, according to Livy, taken tactis sacris, while the Khona of India are said to swear upon an ant-hill that they may be reduced to a similar powder in the event of perjury. The next stage in the development of oaths is that in which the swearer calls on some wild animal to kill him if he lies, a relic of which is found among some of the Indian tribes who are sworn on a tiger's head or among the Russian Ostiaks who invite a bear to devour them should they perjure. Nature, too, has played a great part in oaths. They have been sworn on mighty rivers, such as the Styx of the Homeric gods, or the Ganges so sacred to the Hindu. The Mongol Tungus of Siberia brandishes a knife before the sun, crying: 'If I lie, may the Sun plunge sickness into my entrails like this knife! ' Then follows the transition from nature-religion to anthropomorph- ism, in which the swearer invokes gods conceived in human form, for example, the Roman Jove or the Slavonic god of thunder, Perkun. At this stage it is noteworthy that the curse on the perjurer may take effect beyond the grave so that retribution pursues him into the next world, for primitive peoples had begun to observe that (to quote the masterly meiosis of a learned author on this subject) ' bears and tigers were as apt to kill the truth-tellers as the perjurers, and that even the lightning-flash falls without moral discrimination '. Sometimes a curse is called down by the swearer on himself, that he may perish should he fail to keep his oath, such as the Biblical' So do God to me, and more also ', and the Roman cry of' dii me perdant'. Luther's ' ich kann nicht anders; Gott helfe mir! ', the seventeenth-century English oaths of 'zounds' and ' oddsbodikins ' (derived respectively from God's wounds and body), and the French morbleu are modern variants of the traditional juratory invocation. The legal refinement of oaths has resulted in the affirmation, on which as much reliance is still placed as that placed on oaths taken in our tribal courts in Africa. Privy Councillors and other senior officers of state take an oath of allegiance to the Crown; a judicial oath is sworn by High Court judges; members of a jury are sworn in (hence their name of jurors); army recruits swear allegiance at their attestation parade; and witnesses in legal matters must give evidence under the sanction of an oath. Christendom has adopted the Israelite gesture of extending the hand towards heaven as described in Genesis: 'I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord . .. that I will not take anything that is thine.' A Christian now swears on the Gospels, hold- ing a copy of the New Testament in his right hand with head and hand uncovered; a Jew swears on the Pentateuch; a Mohammedan on the Koran, placing his right hand flat upon the book and putting the other on his forehead before touching the Koran with his forehead; Sikhs upon the Granth Sahib; Hindus upon the Vedas; and the majority of our pagan tribes swear upon steel (a bayonet, knife, or spear) in</page><page sequence="3">ON SWEARING 45 the absence of some other specific oath. This oath ceremony has been extended and perverted by the Kikuyu, whose seven-tier oath-taking ritual is too bestial to be pub- lished but is worthy of note because of its immense binding power. Let us now examine, in their Adamawa context, some of the recent and present forms of judicial swearing among a number of the principal pagan tribes. The Marghi have three oaths to which their siyasa normally have recourse. These are, in ascending order of solemnity: Shafa, Kamale, and Guti. Most important men possess a shafa, and each court carefully guards its own (at Madagali it is kept in the prison). The basic component is a small bundle of the leaves of the Combretum verti- cillatum tree (Hausa: tarauniya), a tree with white spikes of flowers and four-winged fruit. Its leaves are silver-coloured on the underside. Wrapped up in these leaves is an assortment of sacred objects, the whole shafa being tied together with grass rope and bound to a stick. The shafa I examined at Gulak revealed the horn of a waterbuck, the horn of an hartebeest, a left-foot shoe that had belonged to a leper, and an arrow that had been fired but had missed its target. Other ingredients also recognized as con- stituting shafa are: a warthog's bristle, a hair from a lion's tail, a porcupine quill, blades of a red grass, a thorn of the gawo acacia, a piece of the stick traditionally used in grave-digging, and bugs and lice which are usually sprinkled on top of the leaves and their contents. The Marghi assessor of the Madagali Alkali's court assured me that the power of his shafa was considerably enhanced by the inclusion of a monkey's skull among the articles wrapped up in the dried tarauniya leaves. To swear on shafa, a piece of naked steel (either a spear or a knife) is generally laid on top of the bundle, and the accused says to his accuser, in front of the court elders: ' If I have wronged you, may shafa seize me; but if I have done you no wrong, may shafa seize you.' He will then step over the shafa, which has been placed at his feet while he swears. Meek, in his Tribal Studies, tells us that if misfortune strikes the swearer this is a clear sign of his guilt and shafa must again be produced. This time it is the plaintiff who speaks: ' Shafa, you have shown this man to be in the wrong. Release him now from your power that he may pay me.' The guilty party must then step over shafa and pay com- pensation. If, however, the plaintiff should fall ill or otherwise suffer an evil visitation after the first oath has been taken, then it is he who must confess to the accused that he bore false witness and must pay suitable compensation. There is some doubt whether an oath on shafa can be rescinded, but I have met a few elders who declare that this may be permitted if the original swearer has the exceptional temerity to step backwards over shafa and touch it lightly with his foot. Shafa may also be used to guard crops, and the bunch of leaves, possibly mixed with earth from an ant-hill, can often be seen tied to a cornstalk in the corner of a guinea-corn farm as a warning to would-be pilferers; or it may be placed on a head-load that the bearer has had to leave temporarily on a bush track. Anyone interfering would expose himself to the wrath of the tutelary deity. Kamale is the name of an awe-inspiring finger-peak that attracts the eye for many miles along the Yedseram valley, one of the group of crystalline granite pinnacles that dominate the frontier escarpment between the Cubunawa District of Adamawa and the Kapsiki area of the French Cameroons about latitude 1 ?. It rises almost 700 feet from its base, the last 400 feet being an unscalable mass of sheer rock-face. The hill is known locally as Chirgi, with its nearby wife-peak of Humtumale (Hum = hill,</page><page sequence="4">Male = woman; hence Hum-tu-male = wife-of-mountain) and its several grotesque hill-children. At the foot of this magnificent pinnacle-like Jebba rock, a natural juju place-is Khumtla, the ancient, thin-necked fetish pot. It is to this grove that the disputants are sent by the court. Each party must buy a cock (a profitable monopoly for the mai-gunki or priest ?) with which he repairs to the shrine. The priest will address the sacred pot, invoking its spirit to strike down the guilty one and protect the inno- cent. Both cockerels are then released to fight. The owner of the one which first climbs on to the sacred pot is held to be innocent. ' The decision', comments Meek, ' can be manipulated by the priest, who contrives to give drink secretly to the pullet of the man whom he adjudges to be guilty. The other chicken, impelled by thirst, mounts the pot which has been previously filled with water.' This oath is used by many of the neighbouring French tribes as well as by the Marghi and Higi from the British Cameroons. Some adherents have maintained to me that the victorious cock will leap down and kill the other cockerel; others claim that the victor has its throat cut and is eaten by the priest, its blood being poured over the sacred pot; while one man declared that the innocent party's chicken would swell to the size of an ostrich in order to slay its rival. The third Marghi judicial oath is the Guti ordeal. About a mile due east of Husara, a small village at the north end of the Uba hills, there is a fadama (marsh) through which winds a stream. In the reaches of this stream is a deep pool, about 30 feet across. This pool is inhabited by the spirit Guti, who will prevent a guilty person from swim- ming across. Both parties to a dispute will kill a cockerel among the reeds on the western bank and will call on Guti to seize the guilty one; then they strip and dive in. The innocent person will reach the opposite bank without mishap, but the guilty one will become mysteriously paralysed in mid-stream. Some believe that a huge snake seizes him, and that the water, normally tranquil, begins to bubble angrily. He remains thus floundering until his adversary beseeches Guti to release him. It may be a guilty conscience that causes a person to panic, as was often the case in the Saxon ' corsnad ' or trial slice of bread and cheese administered at the altar with the curse that if the accused were guilty God would send the archangel to prevent him swallow- ing. Certain it is that Guti is much feared and respected. I have known very few cases tried here, and have seen a woman at Mbeco court deny her guilt when shafa and Kamale were proposed but immediately plead guilty as soon as the court decided that the case merited the severity of the Guti ordeal. Again, I have heard of an appeal against a decision of the Guti spirit, referring to an ordeal some twenty years earlier, yet at the very suggestion of a retrial by Guti the appellant shuddered and confessed that he had indeed committed perjury. It is quite in order for the litigants to appoint substitutes to swim if they themselves are non-swimmers, in which case they sit behind their chosen swimmers and place their hands on their backs to help Guti, in her near-omniscience, to recognize the vicariously guilty party. This, however, has encouraged the ordeal to degenerate into a professional swimming-race, and respon- sible Marghi opinion, though reluctant to abolish such a puissant and traditional ordeal, admits that the 9s. now (I954) demanded by the substitute swimmers has tended to invalidate the efficacy of the test. Guti was for a time prohibited because of the supposed presence of crocodiles. It is resorted to in the dry season only, as in the rains the whole area becomes marshland. 46 ON SWEARING</page><page sequence="5">ON SWEARING 47 The Higi, another of the leading tribes in Northern Adamawa, also use the shafa and Kamale oaths-shafa, indeed, is common to the Bura, Chibbak, Babur, Njai (Barth's ' Zani '), Gude, Kilba, and several other Mandara hill tribes. The Higi shafa used by the Kankafa court includes in its bunch of tarauniya leaves an arrow-shaft and a strip of cloth torn from the black riga of a burial shroud. This emphasis on the dead suggests an awe of the spirit world, characteristic of oaths in many other countries. The litigant is sworn on it in the same way as with the Marghi shafa. Another oath used by the Higi is that of Pulilaffo, a shrine on the northern face of the Mokolo massif which gives on to the Bazza-Vi route. Accompanied by the Arnado or village headman of Pul, both parties will address the tutelary godling that inhabits the sacred grove, and then swear their innocence on a wide rock on which they stand. Which- ever party later suffers a misfortune, such as an illness in his household, or a fire among his crops, is adjudged to be the guilty one. The Higi also used to practise a form of sasswood ordeal (which we shall consider later in some detail) known as Uwar Makera, but this oath has been prohibited everywhere by the Administration and is no longer countenanced by the native courts. Among the Njai of Maiha District shafa can be used by the courts, but there are a number of shrines, each of which is said to contain a guardian snake, on which oaths are more usually sworn. Examples are the invisible Gogei idol at the Lugdira shrine and the Darba cult at Pakka. Consequent upon the move of the District Headquarters and strengthened by the recent approval of a Njai tribal court, the most important oath is now that of Madafangan, near Mayo Nguli, which has become the leading public cult. It is supposed to have been handed into the care of the Arnado Nguli by the first Njai chief, a Madagali hunter, who brought it from mystic Sukur. On the way to the shrine the litigant may undergo a preliminary tsafi: if an edible wild animal crosses his path, such as a deer or crested duiker, then he may proceed to Madafangan, as his case is favoured; but should he encounter some unclean beast, such as a hyena or jackal, then there is no point in his trying to bluff the Madafangan deity. Another tradition is that if the litigant meets a waterbuck, red baboon, or a Gambian oribi, it is a good omen; but a red-fronted gazelle that wags its tail, a cat, or a flock of rising guinea-fowl are bad augurs and he dare not go on to the shrine lest he fall dead at its threshold. On reaching Madafangan the priest will instruct him to remove his goat- skin and don a pure white cloth before he approaches the shrine, which consists of a baobab-tree, a rock, and (supposedly) a snake. It is a well-known fact among the Njai that, however calm a day it is, a wind will always blow lustily at the shrine just before the litigant makes his oath:' If I did this wrong, may the fetish bring ruin on me and my family and my household.' A similar oath, Buba'en (place of baobab-trees), can be taken at a shrine called Mudurusa, between Humbitode and Kumbo'on on the River Kae. The Kilba are another tribe who use shafa as their simplest form of oath. With them the oath can be taken by touching the sacred object, which at Hong consists of an arrow, an ant, a left-footed native sandal, blades of a tall, coarse, reddish grass (Cymbopogongiganteum; Hausa: tsaure; Fulani: wajalo), and a curved thorn of the kaidaja or riverain mimosa, all wrapped in the silver leaves of the common shafa tree. Another shafa I met with here consisted of seven snake-heads, a misfired arrow, a broken sickle, and a knife. Shafa can be sworn on anywhere, and many iiportant householders keep</page><page sequence="6">their own. In the old days a Kilba would have to triplicate his oath as added security. Having taken his oath on shafa in public, he would be escorted to the shrine of Garga, which reposed in the house of the Til or chief at Hong Lamurde, the royal capital (Lamurde = royal town). The Garga shrine is made up of a number of iron imple- ments contained in a pot with a very narrow mouth embedded in earth up to its neck and closed with a small earthenware cover. For full effect, a libation of sacrificial blood (preferably that of a black cow) would be sprinkled over it before the oath was taken. On his final swearing, the litigant must turn his face towards Lim, the virtually unscalable granite bloc on the summit of the Hong massif, about 2 miles south of the village. Here is the actual shrine, a narrow cave cleft in the rock-face, lofty and remote, in which resides another sacred pot, embellished with four slivers of local iron similar in design to the traditional Kilba female pubic ornaments. Recourse is also had to Lim in times of drought after the first sowing, when the blood of a ram is spilled at the cave-mouth and the meat is devoured by the Hedima, who is in charge of the cult. The second Kilba oath is that described as the Cock's Test, which takes place at the Njai village of Humbitode in the contiguous Maiha District. By the Humbitode hill the spirit dwells, in a baobab-tree near a spring. Both litigants set forth with a cock, and the one whose cock crows first is declared to have won his suit. The cocks may crow anywhere along the bush path, whereupon it is said that the liar's cock's crest will at once turn white and droop in shame. Should neither cock crow before they reach Humbitode, both parties are credited with telling the truth and the oath is declared void. Barth, in his journey to Adamawa in I85 1, gives an account of ' a curious ordeal on the holy granite rock of Kobshi ', though he relates this oath to the Marghi tribe, whereas Kobochi is a centre of the Njai in the French Cameroons and Strumpell's Kobochi vocabulary corresponds with modern Njai. When two are litigating [he writes], each of them takes a cock which he thinks the best for fighting: and they go to Kobshi. Having arrived at the holy rock, they set their birds a-fighting, and he whose cock prevails in the combat is also the winner in the point of litiga- tion. But more than that, the master of the defeated cock is punished by the divinity, whose anger he has thus provoked; and on returning to his village he finds his hut in flames. The Rhum oath of the Kilba was sworn by the River Rhum near Kopri, in the presence of the priest and the accuser: if the man told the truth, fish and crocodiles would emerge from the river and lie on the bank. Korta is another oath, the responsi- bility of a kindred at Jedinyi, but here the oath is not taken on the iron symbols but on a shard (kwasko) of the sacred pot. A further medium, similar to shafa in that it is a household tutelary deity but different in that it is not used by the court, is katu. A small strip of locally smelted iron is placed in a brand new calabash filled with a paste of flour and water. The swearer calls on the fetish to kill him if he is not telling the truth and drinks the concoction. Katu may also be used as an amulet, in which case the iron is set between two potsherds and smeared with a red ochre cross. A similar ochre mark on a cornbin, or a broken calabash filled with chickens' feathers, can also be used to warn off thieves from stealing crops. In cases of witchcraft and suspected theft the Kilba shared the Marghi ordeal of Guti or applied the sasswood ordeal. If a witch was convicted of killing a person by 48 ON SWEARING</page><page sequence="7">sticking needles into a waxen image of the victim, like those weird sisters in Macbeth: I will drain him dry as hay: Sleep shall neither night nor day Hang upon his pent-house lid; He shall live a man forbid: Weary se'nnights nine times nine Shall he dwindle, peak and pine ... he would be either sold as a slave to the Fulani or clubbed to death in the market- place by members of the injured kindred and the Til's slaves. The Gude of Mubi District (called Cheke by Meek, from their Fulani nickname meaning ' zana-mats ') use shafa, on which they spill the blood of a hen before step- ping over it to take the oath. Shinta (Gude: broom) is another tribal oath. The accused will put out his left foot, the priest joins the tips of two native brushes and draws them three times round the calf (or neck, according to some sources) of the accused. If he is guilty, the tips of the brooms will refuse to separate-and what priest does not know how to mix a glutinous paste so that the bristles will adhere to each other? Another customary oath was that of Nzangwana (Hausa: yin tarko; Fulani: zamawal). The hunters would make an enormous net, then the rest of the villagers would go out into the bush with spears, arrows, and sticks to drive all game towards the net where the tribal elders would be sitting in judgement. If a gazelle or leopard, a rabbit, hedgehog, or duiker was caught, the accused was held to be inno- cent; but if a bushcat, monkey, snake, or hyena was ensnared, then the man's guilt was established. If it was a ground-squirrel, however, there was considered to be an error in the accusation and the case had to be retried. The Tur and Wagga, who frequent the mountains at the north-eastern tip of Adamawa Province where it marches with Bornu Province and the Anglo-French international boundary, swear on Hololo. This is a cairn of boulders, before which the swearer stands naked and asks the monolith for the truth to be shown. He will then, per some elders, place his hands on the stone and turn a cartwheel to seal the oath. Should he or his household later suffer any illness or misfortune, his guilt is established. The shafa cult of the other tribes in these hills is unknown to them, but a grass called lidzo is held to be sacred, which a dead man's children will tie round their wrists to ward off their father's ghost. The Bachama of Numan Division have two principal oaths. The first is at Boleng, where the litigant will drink out of a hollowed stone a concoction made from ground leaves of one of the amaryllids and the fur of a bush-cat (a favourite totem of the Mbamo group). 'If I did this thing, let the fetish seize me', declares the swearer. Should he be guilty, the bush-cats will come prowling and howling round his hut at night, and he will fall ill. The bush-cat also helps any Mbamo to discover who has stolen from him by crying outside the thief's house. The other Bachama oath is at Nafarang, the hillock opposite Imburu on the River Benue, whose spirit, should a person swear a false oath, will cause him to swell as though with child till he dies. The Hona and Bura in the Guyaku-Garkida area swear upon Pasha. This is the name of an iron bar kept in the juju grass hut at Dingai. The swearer will make the priest a present of beer and then take in his hand the proffered Pasha, a rod of rough iron some 30 inches long, with rings of iron threaded at one end and a handle rounded E ON SWEARING 49</page><page sequence="8">like a ball-shaped knob. It is presented to the man to swear on wrapped in a grass covering, as only the priest may look on it uncovered. The Bura merge with the Pabir tribe in the part of Bornu Province adjacent to Northern Adamawa, so that their interesting oaths of Melim and their ordeals connected with cacti do not pro- perly fall within this study. The Verre pagans used to employ the common poison ordeal, either of sasswood or a concoction of loofah seeds. Another of their oaths is an appeal to Ula, their god of sun and hunting. A man will seize his bow, hold it up to the sun, and cry out: ' If I lie, may I die this day ', and immediately go off to the bush to hunt some dangerous wild beast, such as a lion or leopard. The Mambila, who inhabit the vast, fertile plateau of Southern Adamawa that joins the Northern Trust Territory to the Cameroons proper, have three main oaths. These are described here in a corroborated but second-hand note, whereas the analysis of all the previous tribal oaths has been based on personal research. I have also come across two accounts of a fourth oath which, however, is quoted with the caution that neither of the recent students of the Mambila has met with its practice. The most common oath is that sworn on thejiru grass. This is a short, tough grass, not unlike the English rat's-tail fescue (Festuca myurus) or its allied brome grasses, which is so sacred that it is rarely hoed out of a path (e.g. that leading up to a Rest House) but rather a deviation is made around it. It is at its most effective when it is displayed with its root and (best of all) complete with seed-heads, but a bunch of its blades is carried by many Mambila elders. To quote a District Officer who has a considerable knowledge of this tribe: 'Jiru is commonly wielded at boundary disputes by excited participants. Its function is somewhat analogous to that of the Crucifix to the Catholic.' Meek adds that before invoking thejiru to punish him if he is lying, the swearer will strike his breast three times with the grass. It may be carried by itself or protected in leaves or chicken feathers. Another oath, used by the Southern Mambila siyasa at Mbamnga, is referred to as Yung, which is the name of the tsafi bell. The President of the Court takes this fetish bell, which is his prerogative and is rung in front of him wherever he goes, and fills the two cones with water. He then scrapes up a pinch of earth, pours it into each cup and spits on it. Drinking a little, he says: 'May what you now say be the truth or the juju will kill you ', and sips again. The man taking the oath then repeats the statement that he is required to swear to, drinks, repeats the formula quoted above, mutatis mutandis, and drinks some more. As a substitute for the severe sasswood ordeal, the Mambila have recourse to a vicarious ordeal, where chickens are substituted for human beings. The two parties will present themselves before the priest or a man who knows how to brew a sass- wood concoction and the poison will be administered to their fowls. These will then be killed in the cruel Mambila fashion of slitting the bird across the beak and allowing it to bleed to death. The first to die denotes the guilty owner. One of the most sacred oaths is said to be that sworn on Ngub Shoa (shoa = fetish), which in its first instance is a charm against witchcraft, so prevalent in Mambila affairs. The symbol consists of a cock's head affixed to the pointed tip of a four-foot long stick of Ngub bark, which is set in the ground. The shaft is decorated with bunches of dried jiru grass and the coarse fruit of the common Gardenia ternifolia ON SWEARING 5o</page><page sequence="9">(Hausa: gauden kura). The head of the cock should always face east, the direction from which all witchcraft is believed to emanate. To settle a dispute, a man may demand to prove his innocence on his adversary's Ngub Shoa. The owner of the sacred symbol will grasp some blades ofjiru grass in his left hand and with his right decapitate the chicken. According to which way the headless chicken falls, the man's innocence or guilt is established. Reference has several times been made in this article to the sasswood ordeal, and I shall close with a description of this extreme form of judicial oath. This must, of necessity, be second-hand, as its practice was outlawed by Government many years ago, though Ward Price has written a gruesome account of' one of those trials by ordeal which were not so uncommon in Yoruba land' as recently as 9I 8. An oath may be said to become an ordeal when a time factor is involved: if the curse invoked upon the perjurer takes immediate effect, it is a sign of condemnation, and thus the invocation has become an ordeal. The drinking of water on which a magic penalty has been laid remains an oath so long as the period of fulfilment is indeterminate; but as soon as a time limit is set, the oath may be reckoned as an ordeal. Ordeals have been prominent throughout the centuries and across the continents. Students of the Orient will be acquainted with the simple ordeal by lot, represented in the Burmese candle- ordeal-where a suit is decided by both parties simultaneously lighting equal- sized candles: he whose candle outlasts the other being adjudged the victor-or in the quaint shellfish ordeal of the Borneo Dyaks. In the Book of Numbers there is a powerful description of the bitter brew that the priest shall prepare for a woman suspected of adultery: 'And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell and thy thigh to rot.' Brass, in Southern Nigeria, was the home of the feather ordeal: if the accused's tongue could be pierced by a chicken's feather without the quill snapping, he was guilty; but if the feather broke before it was pushed through the man's tongue by the priest, then the man was declared innocent. Trial by ordeal was a feature of medieval England and was particularly used for suspected witchcraft under the title of' fleeting ', in which the suspect was stripped and cross-bound, right thumb to left toe and left thumb to right toe, and then ducked in a pond. The punitive ducking-stool continued right down to the beginning of the nineteenth century. But while elemental ordeals have been widespread, such as plunging one's arm into boiling liquid or the red-hot hatchet test obtaining in Central Africa, it is recognized as being in accordance with primitive thought that the strongest of all ordeals is that in which the sacred object is eaten or drunk. Examples of this include the aconite-root potion of Brahmanic law; the great Tibetan oath, in which portions of an ox's heart are devoured, and the nomadic Masai's drink of milk and blood, on which he swears, ' If I have done this deed, may my god kill me.' The oath-draught indeed is a characteristic feature of ordeals, and nowhere has it been more prominent than in West Africa. Let us conclude with a brief glance at the most celebrated of the obsolete ordeals of West Africa, the ubiquitous sasswood and the Mbiam ordeals. The classical account of the ' red-water' or sasswood ordeal, by J. L. Wilson, is valid for most of the West African ordeals, and it requires very little imagination to apply his description to the supreme ordeal as formerly practised by the tribes that we have discussed in this article. ON SWEARING 5</page><page sequence="10">A good deal of ceremony is used in connection with the administration of the ordeal. The people who assemble to see it administered form themselves into a circle, and the pots containing the liquid are placed in the centre of the enclosed space. The accused then comes forward, having the scantiest apparel, but with a cord of palm-leaves bound round his waist, and seats himself in the centre of the circle. After his accusation is announced, he makes a formal acknowledgement of all the evil deeds of his past life, then invokes the name of God three times, and imprecates his wrath in case he is guilty of the particular crime laid to his charge.... He then steps forward and drinks freely of the red-water. This concoction is made from the inner bark of one of the mimosa genus, known as sasswood-it was, together with the milky fluid of the euphorbia, the principal arrow poison. The botanical name is Erythrophleum guineense; gwaska in Hausa. The bark is pounded in a mortar and left to soak in water until its properties have been drained. The resultant fluid is reddish, with an astringent taste, 'in appearance not unlike the water of an ordinary tan vat '. Chemists know the poison erythrophleine as an alkaloid of the curare group, which relaxes the muscles, increases the blood-pressure, and reduces the pulse and respiration till breathing ceases altogether. It was a quart of this bitter decoction that Lander was made to swallow in the fetish hut of the King of Badagry. He records that he suffered no other discomfort than a slight dizziness, but immediately after the ordeal he dosed himself with a vigorous emetic and thereby saved his life. If it nauseates and causes him to vomit freely, he suffers no serious injury and is at once proved innocent. If, on the other hand, it causes vertigo and he loses his self-control, it is regarded as evidence of guilt, and then all sorts of indignities and cruelties are practised upon him. A general howl of indignation rises from the surrounding spectators. Children and others are encouraged to hoot at him, pelt him with stones, spit upon him, and in many instances he is seized by the heels and dragged through the bushes and over rocky places until his body is shamefully lacerated and life becomes extinct. On the other hand, if he escapes without injury, his character is thoroughly purified .... After all this is over, he assembles the principal men of the town and arraigns his accusers before them who, in their turn, must submit to the same ordeal. There is seldom any fairness in the administra- tion of the ordeal. No particular quantity of the red-water is prescribed, and the amount ad- ministered always depends on the state of feeling in the community towards the accused. Mary Kingsley has described the two Calabar draught-ordeals. One is that made from the Calabar bean, a large perennial climber known as Physostigma venenosum; the other is the great fetish drink of Mbiam, which was frequently used in taking oaths. The latter was the most respected and dreaded of all oaths, and from its decision there lay but one appeal-to the court of the final ordeal of the Long Juju at Aro-Chuku, which meant almost certain death. The rich Mbiam formula, recited before swallowing the potion, makes a fitting conclusion to this article on some judicial oaths: If I have been guilty of this crime, If I have gone and sought such a one's hurt, If I have sent another to seek such a one's hurt, If I have employed anyone to make charms or to cook bush, Or to put anything in the road, Or to touch his cloth, ON SWEARING 52</page><page sequence="11">Or to touch his yams, Or to touch his goats, Or to touch his fowls, Or to touch his children, If I have prayed for his hurt, If I have thought to hurt him in my heart, If I have any intention to hurt him, If ever, at any time, I do any of these things, [recite above lists in full] Or employ others to do these things, [recite above lists in full] Then, Mbiam!

Resume SERMENTS JUDICIAIRES DE LA PROVINCE D'ADAMAWA DU NIGERIA DU NORD UN sommaire de l'evolution historique des serments est presente comme arriere-plan d'une etude des serments judiciaires actuellement en usage devant les tribunaux paiens de la Pro- vince d'Adamawa du Nigeria du Nord. A la suite de cet expose preliminaire, chaque serment tribal est examine a tour de role, soit en detail, comme c'est le cas pour les tribus principales Marghi et Kilba, soit plus sommairement pour les tribus moins importantes de la region. Le serment shafa, une sorte de divinite tutelaire personnelle, se manifeste dans presque toute cette rdgion du Cameroun septentrional, et ses divers elements et usages sont examines. Les particularites physiques des montagnes de Mandara figurent dans la prestation des serments, et il y a egalement des epreuves de serval et de chasse, une epreuve du balai et des tribunaux pour ceux qui sont accuses de sorcellerie. L'ordalie a la nage Guti est remarquable par son pouvoir enorme d'obligation, qui est egal, peut-etre, au serment puissant Mambila, que l'on prete sur une tete de coq ornee. II existe maintes variations de l'epreuve du coq, qui a tou- jours figure dans les differends africains, et le baobab, qui se trouve partout, joue un role egalement marque dans la prestation du serment. L'article se termine par un apercu de quel- ques-unes des epreuves historiques les plus celebres et par une dtude plus detaillee des deux plus grandes epreuves de l'Afrique occidentale, a savoir, l'epreuve de l'extrait de l'ecorce de l'arbre africain Erythrophloeum guineense et l'epreuve du Mbiam qui, autrefois, etaient tres repandues et tres puissantes, mais qui sont maintenant condamnees comme etant incom- patibles avec la justice naturelle.
