<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of World Prehistory, Vol. 7, No. 2, 1993 Settlement and Social Change in Central Europe, 3500-1500 BC Stephen J. Shennan1 The chronology of the period is briefly considered in the light of the dendro chronological results which have appeared in recent years. Patterns of settle ment history in different parts of the area are then examined, and it is suggested that in some of them the late fourth millennium was a period of population decline which was not reversed until the Early Bronze Age, 1000 years later. Detailed information about specific local occupation patterns is provided by recent work on the circum-Alpine ' 'lake villages.'' Changes in cultural patterns during the period, especially the appearance of the Corded Ware, are discussed and explanations of them reviewed. It is argued that changing patterns of gender relations were a major feature of the period, linked to processes which even tually led to the development of small-scale chiefdoms. The development of copper and bronze metallurgy and its connection to these processes are dis cussed. KEY WORDS: central European prehistory; chronology; settlement history; social and cultural patterns; gender relations; copper and bronze metallurgy. INTRODUCTION Central Europe is a vaguely defined area and it is not the intention of this paper to give it any greater precision. Roughly speaking, it will be taken to extend from the line of the Rhone and Rhine rivers in the west to Hungary in the east and from the southern half of Poland in the north to the Alps in the south (see Fig. 1). It is the area par excellence which has been dominated by the German 'Department of Archaeology, University of Southampton, Southampton S09 5NH, England. 121 0892-7537/93/0600-0121 $07.00/0 ? 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">'-} \ S :/Helmsdorf*1!

One of the most notable features of this tradition was its resistance to radiocarbon dating, and especially its calibration. On the one hand, it was felt that the dates produced by the radiocarbon method were insufficiently precise to be of any use over the short time spans imagined for the Late Neolithic (LN) and EBA. On the other, they did not fit the interlocking regional chronological sequences worked out over decades of typological work. Probably the greatest change in the study of the Central European LN and EBA in the last decade has been the collapse of this resistance, which has been due to one of the most important developments of the decade, the building of the Central European oak tree-ring chronology (Becker et al., 1985; Schweizerische Gesellschaft fur Ur und Friihgeschichte, 1986); it is this which enables us to specify the absolute dates of the period with which this paper is concerned. It will begin with a review of the chronological patterns and their implications and will go on to examine some of the main trends in settlement, economy, and society and the links between them which characterize the period. The period itself is an impor tant one is the sense that it is generally held to encompass some of the most significant changes in direction in the socioeconomic patterns of the area prior to the appearance of the Roman Empire. CHRONOLOGY Figure 2 shows a chronological table for the main areas of Central Europe. Broadly speaking, the length of the period which may be conventionally des ignated the LN and EBA has more than doubled?to ca. 2000 years?compared with the traditional view, with consequent implications for overall rates of change; for example, the Central European EBA, traditionally believed to start ca. 1800 BC, can now be seen to start at ca. 2300 BC, while the Corded Ware, believed to last from ca. 2200 to 2000/1900 BC, now runs from ca. 2900 to 2400/2200 BC. More specifically, for the Alpine Foreland area, from Switz erland across south Germany to Austria, Becker et al. (1989) show that Corded Ware settlement on the Swiss lakes finishes just before 2400 BC, the Singen cemetery belonging to the Al phase of the EBA is used from ca. 2300 to 2000 BC, later EBA burials from the Neckar area of Germany date to ca. 2000-1800 BC, while the Swiss "lake village" sites are reoccupied ca. 1700-1500 BC, with Middle Bronze Age (MBA) material appearing shortly before the latter</page><page sequence="4">124 Shennan BC 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 J West Alpine Area Early Bronze Age IV Early Bronze Age Mil Corded Ware/ Saone-Rhone Horgen Northern Central Europe Later Unetice EBA(A2) Early Unetice EBA(A1) Bell Beaker Corded Ware Late TRB/ Globular Amphora/ Rivnac TRB Danube Valley Middle Bronze Age Early Bronze Age A2 Early Bronze Age A1 Bell Beaker Corded Ware Cham Altheim Carpathian Basin Maros/Nagyrev Vucedol Baden Fig. 2.

In addition, the classic rich EBA graves of Leubingen and Helmsdorf in the Saale area of Central Germany, believed to date to the culmination of the local EBA ca. 1700-1600 BC, are now known to date to just before 1900 BC and 1800 BC respectively, and not to have any comparable successors. Now that the dendrochronology has demonstrated the incontrovertible validity of the recalibration and of the long chronology for this period, it is perhaps ironical that interregional typological connections are being found which fit in with it, including connections to the Aegean, formerly the foundation of</page><page sequence="5">Settlement and Social Change in Central Europe 125 the short typologically based chronology (Maran, 1987). Some long-standing connections, on the other hand, like the well-known gold-bound amber beads, can now be seen to date to the end of the period, as the find of one from the latest occupation at Zurich-Mozartstrasse, dated to the sixteenth century BC, shows (Barfield 1991). However, the significance of the dendrochronology is not restricted to over turning assumed patterns of chronological links and altering our perspective on rates of change. Equally important is the insight it is providing into the com plexities of early sequences of settlement. The key source of information here is the Swiss, French, and south German "lake villages," mentioned above, whose construction phases can now be dated dendrochronologically to a given year (Schweizerische Gesellschaft fur Ur- und Fruhgeschichte, 1986; Billamboz et al., 1989; Billamboz, 1990); the work on these sites, creating and exploiting this new source of information, is perhaps the greatest achievement in European Neolithic and Bronze Age prehistory of the last 20 years.

What were once seen to be sudden transitions, such as that from Pfyn to Horgen, can now be seen to correlate with breaks in occupation of over 200 years, while others, such as Horgen to Corded Ware, took place within a century (Schiffer decker and Suter, 1986); the EBA settlements show similar episodic patterns (Billamboz et al., 1989). These patterns are discussed in more detail below. PATTERNS IN SETTLEMENT HISTORY The Late Neolithic, ca. 3500-2300 BC Despite some significant exceptions, Central European prehistoric archae ology, with its artifactual and typological emphasis, has not had a strong tra dition of site survey and settlement pattern studies, a situation which has begun to change markedly only in the last 15 years. In this respect the pioneering studies were those of Kruk in southern Poland (1980), who showed that the fourth millennium BC Trichterbecher (TRB) culture groups exploited the land scape in a far more extensive manner than earlier phases, which were restricted largely to the river valleys. TRB settlement penetrated far into the areas between the rivers and was based on a pattern of extremely large nucleated settlements, such as Bronocice (Milisauskas and Kruk, 1984), with smaller surrounding satellites. This settlement pattern may be an indicator of the existence of a two level site hierarchy (Milisauskas and Kruk, 1989a), although whether it, and phenomena like it in other regions, should be construed as evidence for the existence of "chiefdoms" is another matter (see below). It was this pattern which ended with the Corded Ware phase, ca. 2900 BC, when evidence of settlements disappears almost entirely but the distribution of burial mounds points to occupation of the same now presumably extensively cleared landscape and suggests an extremely dispersed pattern of small settlements (see below). Patterns in Central Germany and western Czechoslovakia are similar in many respects. A distribution of nucleated settlements of varying sizes, often in hilltop locations (see, e.g., Starling, 1988), gives way with the Corded Ware to a situation where virtually all the evidence comes from cemeteries and burial mounds. The distribution of the burial evidence, which has in the past been taken as an indication of the area of settlement, points to considerable expansion (Starling, 1985; Shennan, 1986a). This may well be broadly true as far as the area occupied is concerned, but it does not necessarily reflect an increase in population, as has often been assumed. The results of recent work by Mili sauskas and Kruk (1986b) suggest, on the contrary, that in the Little Poland region the TRB phase was followed by a period of major population decline ca.</page><page sequence="7">Settlement and Social Change in Central Europe 127 3100 BC, which, they suggest, was the result of environmental degradation arising from the extensive nature of TRB agricultural practices. In the subsequent Baden and then Corded Ware phases, lasting until the later third millennium, population remained low but was extremely dispersed, hence the large part of the landscape over which Corded Ware burial evidence is found. Further con firmation of the dispersed nature of settlement is given by Neustupny's analysis of the large Corded Ware cemetery of Vikletice in Bohemia (Neustupny, 1983, pp. 15-17). He suggests that nine spatial groups may be distinguished, each containing graves of several phases, and postulates that each of the grave groups represent a family which existed for a greater or lesser period of time before dying out. His conclusion is that in any one phase there may have been four or five families, representing say 25-35 people, but this may have been reduced to a single family by the final phase; his interpretation clearly implies that there was some degree of stability of occupation. In fact, even burials of the Corded Ware phase are not easy to discover when not marked by surviving burial mounds, which have very often been plowed away in Central Europe, and they are generally found during large-scale excavations of sites of other periods; they are usually scattered at distances ranging up to ca. 40-50 m from one another, itself a possible indication of once existing burial mounds. Even allowing for these difficulties, which are relevant to all the Corded Ware areas where mounds are not preserved under forest or pasture, the Danube valley in southern Germany and Austria lacks Corded Ware burials in comparison with areas farther north, despite the fact that some of these, too, may have been thinly populated. It seems likely that the first half of the third millennium BC was a time of low population in this region, again following a decline in population during the later fourth millennium. The argu ment is supported by a number of lines of evidence. The detailed survey work reported by Schmotz (1992) in an area of the Danube valley in Bavaria suggests that settlement density was already declining by the mid fourth millennium, in the Altheim phase, that this continued through the succeeding Cham phase and reached its low point with the Corded Ware; Ottaway (1988) confirms this impression from her own work on the Cham phase in Bavaria. There are signs of renewed settlement in some places in the suc ceeding Bell Beaker phase, but in general it is during the EBA that a real settlement expansion is seen, especially in the latter part, ca. 2000 BC and later. This expansion continued into the MBA before settlement density dropped away again prior to the onset of the LB A Urnfield period. Schmotz notes that the EBA settlement distribution differs from that of earlier phases in its use of sites in small valleys deep in the high terrace zone, a pattern already characteristic of Corded Ware and Bell Beaker distributions farther north. The second line of evidence comes from the deposition of the subfossil oaks used as the basis for the construction of the Central European oak chro</page><page sequence="8">128 Shennan nology. The oaks are found in river deposits in the main valleys where they were swept by major floods. The number of oaks deposited varies with time; Fig. 4 shows the pattern for the Danube valley in southern Germany, 4000 1000 BC (Becker et al., 1985, Fig. 2). The argument has been made that the variation in number of oaks deposited is to some degree a function of the amount of forest clearance, with larger numbers corresponding to more extensive clear ance (Billamboz et al., 1989). On this assumption, it can be seen that the Danube valley has low levels of clearance from before 3000 to after 2500 BC, before rising sharply at a time corresponding to the beginning of the EBA, although this does not coincide with Schmotz's archaeologically based argument, albeit from a very localized area, that the earlier part of the MBA was the period of greatest expansion. Finally, a further indication of relatively low population levels in southern Central Europe during the third millennium is given by settlement and pollen evidence from the Alpine part of the valley of the river Salzach in western Austria (see map, Fig. 1); this shows that the valley was occupied in the late fourth millennium but then largely, if not entirely, abandoned until ca. 2000 BC, when it was extensively reoccupied (Shennan, 1989, 1992). All in all, therefore, we have fairly convincing evidence that in much, although not all, of Central Europe the late fourth and earlier part of the third millennium BC, down to ca. 2400 BC, and later in some places, was a period of major population decline or, rather, that after a relatively sudden decline in the late fourth millennium, it remained low for the best part of 1000 years before increasing again. This EBA expansion was most probably a result of indigenous growth since there is no evidence of strong external contacts at this time. More plausible as a time when there might have been external inputs to local popu lations is the postulated period of population decline and its aftermath at the end of the fourth millennium, since in many areas the latter was associated with the Corded Ware. Was there a widespread vacuum in population, the result of factors yet to be identified, which was filled, albeit to a low density only, by groups characterized by Corded Ware material culture?

The chronological distribution of oak trunks found in the Danube floodplain (after Becker etal, 1985).</page><page sequence="9">Settlement and Social Change in Central Europe 129 Corded Ware is discussed again below but the definition and absolute dating of such interregional patterns of growth and decline on a large spatial scale, includ ing both western and eastern Europe, are a major and urgent task for the future. The Swiss 4'lake village" occupation sequence has been noted above and it has been pointed out (Billamboz et al., 1989) that it is in some ways the converse of what we have just seen for southern Germany?extensive episodes of later fourth and earlier third millennium BC occupation cease around 2400 BC and there is a gap of 600-700 years before occupation restarts in the later EBA, when occupation is also dense elsewhere in southern Central Europe as we have seen (Billamboz et al., 1989). The key to the lakeside settlement pattern is the long-term variations in the lake levels; when lake levels were high the sites were abandoned. These variations largely coincide with one another over a wide area, so that it is unlikely that local factors were responsible; furthermore, there is also some evidence that they correlate with advances in the Alpine glaciers and with low summer temperatures indicated by tree-ring evidence (Petrequin and Petrequin, 1988, p. 10). It was a general rise in lake levels which led to the hiatus from ca. 2400 to ca. 1700 BC. The EBA occupation patterns are discussed below, but first it is necessary to discuss the earlier lake settlement sequences in more detail because, as we will see, the wealth of evidence that these sites possess as a result of their exceptional preservation conditions provides extremely illuminating information of great general importance, unobtainable elsewhere, on the microscale of early economic and social life. In this respect an important case study is provided by the site of Clairvaux IV, on the lake of Clairvaux in Alpine eastern France (Petrequin and Petrequin, 1988, pp. 146-147). The first and final villages on this site are not securely dated, but the second is between 3055 and 3025 BC, the third 2985-2980 BC, and the fourth sometime after 2942 BC. The Petrequins suggest that this pattern of occupation implies a fallow period for agricultural land of about 40 years, significantly shorter than the fallow periods during the Middle Neolithic (MN) and insufficient for the primary forest to regenerate. The argument is supported by the pollen evidence from the Clairvaux lake. The short clearances and long fallow periods of the MN are visible as successive but clearly separated rises in cereal and grass pollen, but from ca. 2800 BC it becomes impossible to isolate the clearances; the curve of cereal pollen becomes continuous, while tree pollen levels progressively decrease and the type of timber used to build the houses also changes. The pattern of decreased fallow and increased length of occupation is still more marked elsewhere in the lake village zone. In the area of Auvernier on Lake Neuchatel movements of settlements become exceptional after ca. 2800 BC, and one finds settlements occupied and reconstructed over periods of 50 90 years; after ca. 2600 BC this stability increases still further and some settle</page><page sequence="10">130 Shennan ments did not move for over a century. The subsistence changes associated with this increased stability are discussed below. Clearly these indications of changing settlement stability are of interest as indicating processes which may have been going on elsewhere in Central Europe but which it is largely impossible to document, although the length of use of the Vikletice Corded Ware cemetery in Bohemia discussed above (Neustupny, 1983) also points to some degree of stability. However, there does appear to be some degree of contrast between the lake villages and many other parts of Central Europe, because the Swiss area seems to show indications of a popu lation increase at a time when others were in decline. In addition to their detailed information on clearance patterns, the lake village also provide evidence for changing methods of house construction and their link to clearance activity. As we have seen, it is apparent that in most of Central Europe patterns of settlement nucleation in the later fourth millennium give way to a pattern of small settlements and dispersion early in the third; but why are these settlements so invisible archaeologically? It has often been sug gested that it arises from a move to a form of house construction based on the jointing of vertical posts into horizontal sill beams laid on the ground rather than inserted in postholes. At the lake village sites there is clear evidence of the introduction of this type of construction, and the reasons behind it can also be documented. It is found at Clairvaux toward 2600 BC but already occurs during the MN on some of the other lakes (Petrequin and Petrequin, 1988, pp. 214 217). It is true that the technique is particularly good for ensuring that houses do not sink into marshy ground under their own weight, but as the Petrequins point out, its introduction is very plausibly seen as a response to the increasing extent of clearances and the shortening of fallow periods, since it could be used with the lighter timber which was now widespread and which was also easier to transport over the increasing distances now required. Given that such increas ing clearance had become widespread in many parts of Central Europe by this time and coincides with the disappearance of settlement evidence, the possibility that this arose from the increasing use of the difficult to detect sill-beam con struction is enhanced and an explanation is provided for its adoption at this particular time. The Early Bronze Age, ca. 2300-1500 BC It has already been seen that on the Alpine and sub-Alpine lakes there is no occupation between ca. 2400 and 1700 BC as a result of high lake levels, while in the Danube valley in southern Germany the indications are that, after a low point in the first half of the third millennium, clearance and settlement increased from the beginning of the EBA, ca. 2300 BC, into the MBA, ca. 1500 BC, before a decline, in some zones at least, at the beginning of the LBA.</page><page sequence="11">Settlement and Social Change in Central Europe 131 In other parts of the valley of the Danube and its tributaries the situation seems to be similar. In southwest Slovakia there seems to be a resurgence of settlement, with the appearance in the Al phase of the EBA, from ca. 2300 BC, of the Nitra group, evidenced not by settlements but by cemeteries often con taining several hundred graves and lasting ca. 200-300 years, if not more (see Shennan, 1975, 1982); this expansion is continued right through the EBA up to the rich fortified sites belonging to the transition to the MBA at ca. 1600-1500 BC (Shennan, 1982, 1986a; and below). Such evidence is paralleled slightly farther west in Lower Austria; here an outstanding series of recent rescue excavations in the valley of the river Traisen has completely transformed our knowledge of EBA settlement (Neugebauer, 1987; Neugebauer and Neugebauer-Maresch, 1990). Along the gravel terraces of the river is an extensive series of cemeteries and settlements. Settlement is on the terrace edge overlooking the flood-plain and takes the form of a scatter of farmsteads or small hamlets along the river, typically consisting of one or two 17 x 8-m houses with ancillary buildings and pits. The cemeteries lie behind the settlements, farther from the river. At Franzhausen there were two adjacent cemeteries, one with more than 700 burials, lasting from ca. 2300 to 1600 BC, and another containing over 1000 burials, estimated to have lasted ca. 800 years, with the earliest burials in the late Corded Ware phase and the latest in the early Middle Bronze Age. It is estimated that the community size required to produce the Franzhausen I cemetery would have been ca. 110 people, while for the nearby cemetery of Gemeinlebarn F, restricted to a single phase late in the EBA, it would have been ca. 80-85 (Henrich and Teschler-Nicola, 1991, p. 234). Given the nature of the settlements themselves, this clearly implies some kind of grouping of the farmsteads into recognized local community units of some significance, but there is no evidence of any settlement hierarchy until the transition to the MBA when a fortified site over 1 ha in size appears in the area, a phenomenon which is widespread in Central Europe at this time (see below). Although no such large or long-lived cemeteries are known from Bavaria, there is a similar dispersed settlement pattern. Schmotz (1992) notes that most EBA sites are less than 0.1 ha in size, although some are larger, while in the MBA the average is closer to 1 ha; there are strong indications of settlement continuity from the EBA to the MBA here as elsewhere. It used to be thought that the appearance of large numbers of burial mounds on high ground in the MBA marked a major shift in settlement pattern indicating a move to a more pastoral way of life, but the evidence from settlement distributions points to an expansion rather than a relocation of occupation, and recent aerial survey has shown that burial mounds are to be found in previously unsuspected locations, in particular on alluvial stream deposits and in the flood plains of the Isar and Danube, while the settlements were on the terraces. This distribution of burial</page><page sequence="12">132 Shennan mounds may indicate the use of marginal land for burial; on the other hand, the mounds themselves may in effect lay claim to areas which would have produced rich pasture at certain times of the year. The fact that Bronze Age burial mounds have survived and are visible in the Danube flood plain is in itself significant, of course, since it indicates that the Danube has been relatively stable since this period and that evidence for the Bronze Age at least is not, in general, buried under meters of subsequent silt (Schmotz, 1992). The final evidence for settlement expansion in the south German/Danube valley area to which attention must be drawn is the remarkably uniform pattern seen in the occupation of hilltop settlements in this region (Fig. 5). As Biel (1987) shows, large numbers of these come into occupation in the A2 phase of the EBA and continue for varying lengths of time into the MBA, although virtually all of them go out of use by the end of the MBA, in a pattern similar to that noted by Schmotz for the area of the Danube plain in Bavaria that he examined. While some of these sites may possibly be local centers, it is likely that the majority are ordinary settlements since no other type is known; like those in the plain, they are mostly small in size. Where the evidence exists, the EBA settlement pattern in the more northern part of Central Europe?in western Czechoslovakia, central Germany, and southern Poland?seems to be very similar to that in the Danube valley, con sisting mainly of small hamlets, such as that at Cakovice in Bohemia (Turkova and Kuna, 1987) (see Fig. 6). Work gathering extensive records of early finds in the Elbe valley in northern Bohemia has enabled the reconstruction of the EBA settlement pattern for a small region (Zapotocky, 1982) (see Fig. 7). It shows a dense concentration of sites, with 15 settlements in an area of 6 x 5 km, and most of them have adjacent cemeteries. The grave goods enable an estimate to be made of the length of use of the cemeteries in terms of the typological phases which have been defined for the Unetice EBA (Moucha, 1963). Nine of the thirteen cemeteries were used in two or more phases, which clearly indicates some degree of settlement stability. Zapotocky (1982) suggests that the pattern was one of small hamlets and scattered isolated farmsteads, like those elsewhere we have already seen. In the case of this particular area there is no indication of fortified settlements developing which might have acted as local centers, but such settlements are in fact widespread in Central Europe in the later EBA, as we have already noted, and they are discussed below in the context of social change within the period. As with the LN, further insight into the dry land settlements of the EBA and their possible patterns of use can be gained by an examination of the evi dence from the waterlogged sites of the sub-Alpine area. The Forschner site is situated in the Federsee basis in southern Germany and was partially excavated in 1983-1989 (see Fig. 8) (Billamboz et al., 1989). In 1767-1766 BC a log palisade was built.

In 1731-1730 BC the houses and the rampart were repaired. Toward 1600 BC a long track was built leading from the site to the southermost point of the basin. From 1508 BC construction activity shows a general reorganization of the site, begun a century earlier with the change in access direction; the construction phase around 1508 was followed by another ca. 1480 BC. There was probably a phase of aban donment during the seventeenth century BC and there was certainly another lake transgression of the end of the second phase of occupation. The wood for the initial occupation was drawn from primary forest but that used in the following construction periods at 1600 and 1508-1480 BC betrays the impact of human activity on the surrounding woodland. It is clear that as a result of overgrazing and uncontrolled exploitation of the forest, regeneration did not occur. Only scattered large oaks remained, which were themselves even tually cut down.</page><page sequence="15">Settlement and Social Change in Central Europe 135 Reconstruction of settlement pattern Burials of phases 1-2 Settlement W 3-4 Ob&gt; 5-6 /SA Fig. 7.

SUBSISTENCE AND PRODUCTION The preceding discussion of settlement patterns obviously has considerable implications for the study of early subsistence, but so far this has been considered only tangentially, especially in relation to patterns of clearance and the increas ingly long-term occupation of some settlements and local areas. It is now nec essary to consider the subject more directly. In recent years the key idea in the study of subsistence in the period with which this paper is concerned has been the concept of the "Secondary Products Revolution" developed by Sherratt (1981, 1983).

Plan of the Forschner site, an EBA settlement in the Federsee basin, south Germany (after Billamboz et al.y 1989). earlier Neolithic, animals were used almost entirely for meat but that new uses later developed, involving the exploitation of their milk, wool, and traction power. These new uses are believed to have diffused into Central Europe from the steppes and the Near East ca. 3500 BC, although wool is most probably rather later. The coherence of this set of innovations has been much debated (Chapman, 1982; Sherratt, 1986); in particular, it has been argued that if wool is later then evidence for milk is certainly earlier and goes back to the earliest</page><page sequence="17">Settlement and Social Change in Central Europe 137 local Neolithic (Bogucki, 1984). However that may be, the animal traction aspect does seem to be a recognizable complex, involving both the cart and the plow, which appeared in Central Europe ca. 3500 BC and was to have a con siderable impact not just on forms of subsistence but perhaps even more so on forms of society and their central principles. Elsewhere it has been argued that the traction complex was a key factor in the expansion and dispersion of settle ment described above because it enabled existing social and economic con straints to be overcome (Shennan, 1986a). Once again the "lake village" sites can provide us with information unob tainable anywhere else, although it is important to remember that the specifics of their economic patterns cannot be generalized too widely. If one thing is clear, it is that LN subsistence varied extremely widely even within quite small areas (Glass, 1988). At the lake sites of the French Jura the earliest occurrence of the perforated ceramic vessels assumed to be used for cheese-making dates to ca. 3000-2950 BC, a marked contrast with their fifth millennium BC date in Linear Pottery contexts in Poland (Bogucki, 1984), and the type is found widely in the final Neolithic of the southern Jura and southwest Switzerland; it is probably asso ciated with the diffusion of techniques from southern France, where such vessels occur in Chassey culture contexts ca. 4500 BC (Petrequin and Petrequin, 1988, p. 128). Indications of the first use of the wheel in the Jura occur at the same date, ca. 3000 BC, but it is worth emphasizing the remote location of this area in relation to access to innovations. Around 3000 BC at the site of Chalain 2 a trackway was built, more substantial than previous types. It was made of logs and planks, which would have used an enormous amount of timber and would have required repair every 5-6 years; the width of the track was 1.70-2.00 m and the posts supporting it were driven into the ground more deeply than those supporting the houses. The only possible reason for this great investment of effort is the use of the track by oxen pulling carts or timber for building (Petrequin and Petrequin, 1988, p. 140). Finds elsewhere confirm this suggestion. At the site of Zurich Pressehaus in a context dating to ca. 2700 BC, the remains of a burned wagon were found which was clearly used for the transport of goods; it measured 3.30 x 1.40 m and had well-constructed tripartite wheels with complex mortice joints. But the construction of the Chalain track has other implications. It was renewed over a period far longer than the duration of a single village. Over the period 3000-2450 BC successive villages were built along it, albeit with inter vening phases of total abandonment. The same track was used in the EBA, ca. 1700-1600 BC, and again in the LB A, without any alteration of its course. The Petrequins suggest (1988, p. 143) that the introduction of the ox cart required the construction of tracks not just in marshy areas, but in all those areas exploited</page><page sequence="18">138 Shennan by farmers, and that the investment of time and effort was such that the main axes of the local route networks did not change for over 2000 years. The increasing clearance and the shortening fallow led to changes in the technology required for clearance. The axes used for clearing primary forest were not suitable for clearing the bushes and brushwood of secondary growth, which required the use of the adze and a different cutting technique (Petrequin and Petrequin, 1988, p. 150). The adze blades were set in sleeves of red deer antler, which were then hafted. It appears that there was an increase through time in the density of antler sleeves in settlement deposits, indicating a greater consumption of antler than earlier, because of the new clearance needs, at a time when the clearances themselves were having a negative impact on the availability of red deer (Petrequin and Petrequin, 1988, p. 149). Intensification of red deer exploitation occurs at different times in different places, depending on the local progress of agricultural colonization. In the Clairvaux area it devel oped ca. 3400 BC and antlers from this period tend to be poorly formed, sug gesting that the deer population was under ecological pressure. However, a change in tool technology which meant that it was now possible to obtain more than one ax sleeve from a single antler resulted in a slackening of pressure on the deer ca. 2800 BC, and a new equilibrium among tools, agricultural practices, and the environment was established (Petrequin and Petrequin, 1988, p. 153). Nevertheless, increasing clearance did not have an entirely negative impact on the use of wild resources. The increased extent of young secondary forest meant that there were actually more plant resources available for human con sumption than in the primary forest, and gathered resources were more frequent ca. 3000 BC than they were half a millennium earlier. At the same time there was a considerable increase in pig consumption at the lake sites or, at least, increasing quantities of pig bones in archaeological deposits. In fact, this is an extremely widespread phenomenon in much of LN Europe and it may well be that pig-keeping, too, was favorably influenced by the increased availability of secondary forest resources; increased sedentariness, as settlements stayed in one place for increasing lengths of time, may also have been a factor. Outside the exceptional conditions of the lake villages, evidence concerning subsistence is generally rare in Central Europe at this time, mainly because of the lack of settlements which characterizes the period down to ca. 2000 BC and later, but also because of the relative lack of interest on the part of Central European archaeologists in economic questions, which has meant that even where specialists have analyzed relevant material, it has not been incorporated properly into archaeological accounts. As noted above, the main issues relevant to the period concern the impact of the Secondary Products Revolution. If animal traction had penetrated the remote fastnesses of the Chalain-Clairvaux area and their less than ideal con ditions for the use of wheeled transport by 3000 BC, it seems safe to assume</page><page sequence="19">Settlement and Social Change in Central Europe 139 that it was a very widespread phenomenon and that the same is true of the plow, for which a variety of evidence exists from ca. 3500 BC (Sherratt, 1981) [see also Midgley (1992) for a review of the evidence from the TRB culture in the northern part of Central Europe, in which she suggests that the plow may be rather earlier than wheeled vehicles]. The date of the appearance of woolly sheep in Central Europe is still not clear, although the first definite evidence of the use of wool comes from the EBA (Barber, 1991). It has been suggested that the representations of figures wearing geometrically patterned clothing on the LN stelae of the Saone-Rhone culture from Sion-Petit Chasseur in Switzerland and other sites may be an indication of the early use of wool, but extremely sophisticated woven cloth with geometrical patterns was already being made of linen in the early fourth millennium in the Swiss lake area (Barber, 1991), so there must be some doubt about this argument. The use of the pin as a clothes fastener and ornament, which is associated with the Corded Ware, may be linked with the early use of wool. Although it does not as such form part of Sherratt's Secondary Products Revolution, the first use of the horse in Central Europe is also a feature of the period with which this paper is concerned. Currently, the earliest evidence for the use of the horse other than as an occasional source of hunted meat comes from Dereivka in the Ukraine, a site of the Sredni Stog culture, where there is evidence of horse-riding, in the form of bit wear on teeth, dating to ca. 4000 BC (Anthony and Brown, 1991). This is associated with the beginning of exten sive exploitation of the horse as a food source. While some see this as evidence of horse domestication (Anthony and Brown, 1991, p. 32), others have sug gested that it is an indication of intensified horse hunting (Levine, 1990), aided by the domestication of the horse for riding. It had been thought that the earliest evidence for riding from Central Europe was represented by cheek pieces from horse bits dating to the late fourth mil lennium (Lichardus, 1980); however, it has recently been argued very convinc ingly that the artifacts on which the argument was based cannot be interpreted as cheek pieces, and indeed have nothing to do with riding at all (Dietz, 1992). Perhaps all the more surprising, therefore, is the recent evidence from the Cham culture site of the Galgenberg in lower Bavaria (Ottaway, 1988), dating to ca. 3000-2800 BC, where the faunal assemblage comprises over 23% horse bones by number, which apparently displace the more usual domestic component, rather than the wild element, of comparable assemblages (Glass, 1988). Both the cultural context, in the locally derived LN Cham culture, and the location contradict expectations for specialist horse exploitation. Since, unlike the steppes, there is no reason to assume the existence of large herds of wild horses in this area, the presumption must be that they were domesticated, or at least managed, no doubt through the use of riding. Further evidence of the use of the horse in late fourth millennium BC Central Europe comes from Central Germany, where</page><page sequence="20">140 Shennan horse bones appear in pits of the Bernburg culture at Halle-Dolauer Heide (Star ling, 1988). Very high horse bone percentages also occur on the later third millennium sites containing small numbers of Bell Beakers on the Danube at Budapest (Bokonyi, 1971). The phenomenon is a relatively transient one, since by the time we come to the later EBA, ca. 2000 BC, horses occur on Central European sites only in small numbers and it is clear that they were not a major food source. In fact, the decorative craftsmanship shown by horse gear and its occurrence on certain fortified settlements make it apparent that by this time horse-related activities had become the elite activity which it was to remain, although Dietz (1992) connects these items with the use of early chariots rather than the riding which has generally been assumed. CULTURAL PATTERNS AND THEIR CHANGES We have seen that from the late fourth through the third millennium BC there were major settlement pattern changes in Central Europe, with distinctly different situations in different regions: in the cirucm-Alpine "lake village" area the beginning of the third millennium seems to involve an expansion of occu pation, whereas in the Danube valley there seems to have been a marked decline, and expansion occurred only in the EBA. In the north the picture is less clear. According to Milisauskas and Kruk (1989b), as we have seen, there was also a population decline in southeast Poland prior to the appearance of the Corded Ware. It is impossible to say at present whether there was a comparable decline in the late TRB and its equivalents in Bohemia and Central Germany. The large number and wide distribution of burials in the subsequent Corded Ware phase are inconclusive in this regard; they could indicate population increase or merely a more extensive and thinly spread use of the landscape. In all areas settlement becomes more dispersed. These changes were strongly affected by the intro duction of animal traction and the plow and the associated increased importance of animal keeping. The dispersed pattern lasted through much of the EBA, even though in some areas the settlements become increasingly stable, as the lake villages and the Lower Austrian cemeteries indicate. What is particularly inter esting, however, is that whereas the existing view of the Secondary Products Revolution is that it represented a period of intensification followed by growth, it now appears that in some regions at least it was followed by decline. As we noted at the beginning of this paper, there are also major cultural changes in the period with which we are concerned, and it is these with which most of the regional archaeology has been concerned. The pattern in the Car pathian Basin is out of step with that farther west. There is a continuing evolution of local patterns from the Baden culture at ca. 3500 BC into the local EBA, represented by the Nagyrev culture and the Maros group; O'Shea (1992) has</page><page sequence="21">Settlement and Social Change in Central Europe 141 recently shown that the Maros group lasts for ca. 1000 years, from 2500 to 1500 BC. Farther to the west the main cultural change is undoubtedly the appearance of the Corded Ware at ca. 2900 BC, as we have already seen, and to a lesser extent the Bell Beakers, which between them are generally agreed to form the background for the cultures of the EBA, although Midgley (1992) has recently argued that many of the changes usually associated with the Corded Ware are already apparent in the late TRB. Discussions of the mechanisms of change involved in the appearance and spread of these two phenomena have been par adigmatic of the theoretical changes which have occurred in European prehistory over the last 20 years, with long-standing migration models replaced by expla nations in terms of emulation, prestige, and risk minimization arising from changing patterns of production (e.g., Shennan, 1986a,b). The phenomena have attracted particular attention for a number of reasons: their extremely widespread distributions, the major break in local sequences that they represent in many areas (although, again, contrast Midgley, 1992), and the fact that they have long been connected with such deeply felt topics as the spread of Indo-European languages and the demise of "Old Europe" (e.g., Gimbutas, 1991). Most recently there has been an interest in reviving versions of the migra tion model. Kristiansen (1992) has suggested that the appearance of the Corded Ware in Denmark represents "a classic example of a migrating tribal people, settling within a short period of time in a new sparsely populated environment, largely defined by resistance from existing TRB settlements" (pp. 8-9). As we have already seen, there is every reason to believe that there were population density variations between different regions in LN Central Europe and that some regions were expanding while others were declining (cf. Lewthwaite, 1987), so the existence of population flows is extremely probable. However, it seems unlikely that such flows can account for the appearance of a phenomenon which stretches for a distance of over 1500 miles east-west in an environment which was not conducive to long-distance movement, unlike the steppe zone to the southeast. The same problem is faced by arguments that the widespread uni formity in material culture was associated with the need to establish new modes of social integration as settlement expanded and units of settlement became smaller; the scale of the uniformity is much larger than needs for social inte gration and risk minimization would require. Sherratt (1991) sees the role of the Corded Ware, and its predecessor in the eastern part of its distribution, the so-called Globular Amphorae culture, as essentially ceremonial. As an example of the complex patterning in material culture distributions which arises in many areas in the late fourth and third millennia, he points to central Germany, where there is a range of ceramic types which are only partially successive and whose distributions at least partly over lap. The explanation offered by Sherratt is that the most distinctive types of</page><page sequence="22">142 Shennan vessel had specific ceremonial uses as containers for particular kinds of ritual consumption which were, in effect, in competition with one another, and many of which involved the use of psychoactive substances such as opium, cannabis, and alcohol. Central Germany was at the crossroads of all these different influ ences: opium of local origin, alcohol from the south, and cannabis from the steppes in the east; the latter, in Sherratt's argument, is the source of the typical hemp cord decoration of the Corded Ware beaker, now used for alcohol or a liquid version of cannabis. However, apart from the settlement pattern changes outlined earlier, the shift to the Corded Ware involves more than the use of a different kind of ritual stimulant; there is also a change in ritual practice in many areas. In the preceding TRB period in the northern half of Central Europe, rituals took place over long periods at burial monuments as well as at other sites which had a role as cere monial centers (Starling, 1988), where such items as ceramic drums have been found; the rites most probably involved a separate group of ritual officiants. With the Corded Ware this pattern changed. Ceremonial centers were abandoned and there were no longer long-term rituals at burial monuments, which were themselves smaller and generally involved the successive deposition of individ ual inhumation burials with standardized sets of grave goods, rather than the previous collective forms. This shift in ritual pattern paralleled that in settlement pattern which has already been emphasized, toward the dispersal of smaller units widely spread over the landscape. Sherratt (1991) associated it with a change in emphasis from a collective representation associated with group ances tors to one in which smaller-scale, perhaps familial, lines of ancestry were emphasized. However, the preceding ritual/social system was not collective in the sense of egalitarian. On the contrary, it was hierarchical, in that the ritual activity of communities took place in special locations where mediators acted on behalf of the community as a whole, although Starling (1988) rightly ques tions the extent to which these sites were centers of political control in the manner of the chiefdoms much more convincingly evidenced during the Bronze Age. Ritual consumption, which had taken place in the context of these rituals, as the archaeological remains from ceremonial centers and tombs make clear, changed its nature and context. Sherratt (1991) proposes that the evidence of personal drinking equipment in burials indicates that substances such as alcohol were no longer restricted to special officiants on special occasions but became symbolic of a more general status category, probably socially adult males. We may perhaps suggest further that whereas the Middle Neolithic rituals were concerned with large corporate groups and their continuity, the new rituals were concerned with social categories and their reproduction. These categories did not have a local identity?local groups of any kind were very small, as we have seen, while the categories were very widespread?and thus were not functioning</page><page sequence="23">Settlement and Social Change in Central Europe 143 entities, but presumably those who belonged to them had similar roles or inter ests in their local situations. In summary, then, the appearance of the Corded Ware represents a major shift, because a new economic pattern was associated with a ritual and social one, both aspects of the process of dispersion. A further aspect of the change was an apparently increased emphasis on male-female distinctions and the use of male prestige goods, but this is a matter to which we return below. This insistence on the Corded Ware as a social, ritual, and economic change does not exclude a role for movements of groups of people. While there must have been a local transition in some areas, in others the new pattern may have come in with new people. Such a situation seems especially likely given the indications that the period preceding the Corded Ware represents a population decrease in many parts of Central Europe. Population overflows from one region into another are thus feasible and even likely, while it is also entirely possible that existing local populations switched over to various aspects of the new way of life. The Corded Ware is succeeded in most of Central Europe by the Bell Beakers, which very much represent a continuation of the Corded Ware phe nomenon, although globally they have a different distribution, taking in much of western Europe where Corded Ware was unknown. Like the latter, they are represented in Central Europe mainly by small cemeteries of individual inhu mation burials containing characteristic grave goods, including the decorated Bell Beakers themselves, as well as copper daggers, archers' wrist-guards, and arrowheads, which occur much less frequently than the pottery. The settlements are small and dispersed and, in some cases at least, show evidence of mixed agriculture and animal traction (e.g., Rakovsky, 1985). In the 1970s explanations of this distribution as the trace of a wandering people were largely abandoned in favor of others which saw it as representing a special assemblage of prestige goods which were widely exchanged (Shennan, 1976). It is now increasingly clear, however, that while this may be true for many elements of the Bell Beaker assemblage, it does not work for the decorated beakers themselves, which were generally made locally, even where they formed part of ceramic assemblages which were otherwise completely different from the beakers and were also local in origin; this has recently been shown for Bohemia and Moravia by Rehman et al (1992). Like the Corded Ware beakers from which they derive, they are best seen as a special vessel type with a rather strictly defined decorative vocabulary and syntax strongly associated with largely male drinking rituals. But here again, precisely as in the case of the Corded Ware, there is no reason why these new prestige items and fashions could not have arrived in some cases as the result of regional population expansion (Lewth waite, 1987). This case is argued by Petrequin and Petrequin (1988, pp. 251 253) for the upper Rhone area on the western edge of Central Europe, on the</page><page sequence="24">144 Shennan basis of such sites as the Margot cave at Montrond, close to the Chalain and Clairvaux "lake villages" discussed above. This was a seasonal hunting camp where decorated Bell Beakers and smooth undecorated pottery were found, both used for domestic purposes. While the stone, bone, and antler tools were in the local final Neolithic tradition, the pottery, including the undecorated material, represented a complete break with previous traditions but was undoubtedly made locally by individual communi ties. In the French Jura, western Switzerland, and the south of France, the Petrequins suggest, the appearance of Bell Beakers represented the diffusion of a style of pottery which was completely new, including its techniques of man ufacturing and firing as well as decoration, but used for the normal functions of the cooking and presentation of food. The only explanation for this, they sug gest, is the movement of small human groups from the lower and middle Rhine, where the Bell Beaker as a type originated. However, although the explanation or rather explanations of the Bell Beaker phenomenon are still unclear, in Central Europe it is the Bell Beakers and, to a lesser extent, the Corded Ware which provide the cultural substratum for the various regional groups of the EBA; but it is not the sort of pure Bell Beaker assemblage described for the Margot cave at Montrond which provides the basis. What is characteristic of the later Corded Ware and of the ceramic assemblages associated with decorated Bell Beakers in most of Central Europe is the impact they show of influences from the Carpathian Basin, with the appearance of new food-serving assemblages consisting of black burnished cups and conical bowls. It is these forms, derived ultimately from the Baden tradition, that formed the core of the ceramic assemblages through much of Central Europe during the EBA. GENDER, PRESTIGE, AND EXCHANGE The changing nature of gender relations is an item which has long been on the agenda of European prehistory, in fact ever since Engels' discussion of the origins of patriarchy, which has usually been associated with the later Neolithic, that is, the later fourth millennium BC, in Central Europe. Childe (e.g., 1957) raised the issue, as did Neustupny (1967), who argued that the introduction of plow agriculture at this time transformed the division of labor between men and women since the latter were now removed from agricultural activity and men came to have patriarchal authority. The contrast between a female-centered "Old Europe" and a patriarchal Europe has also been at the center of Gimbutas' (e.g., 1991) agenda. In her case, however, its introduction is associated with the incursion of Indo-European-speaking "Kurgan" people, whose male-oriented cosmology and society are regarded as ultimately deriving from their pastoral life on the steppes north of the Black Sea. Most recently Hodder (1990) has</page><page sequence="25">Settlement and Social Change in Central Europe 145 seen the European Neolithic in terms of a contrast between two principles, the "domus" and the "agrios," the domestic and the wild, in which the latter gradually comes to dominate. However, while he sees the agrios in terms of the value attached to fighting, hunting, and the "male," he is skeptical of the inference that this actually implies male domination, seeing the change as in the realm of representations of gender relations rather than necessarily in the rela tions themselves (1990, p. 308), although, as he points out, "The cultural representations cannot be contrasted with 'real' human relations. The myths, the representations are themselves part of reality; they are constructed within real social processes" (1990, p. 309). The period when these changes, however they are characterized, took place in Central Europe is the LN, ca. 3500-2500 BC, although Hodder sees them as having much earlier roots, while Neustupny and Sherratt associate them with the so-called Secondary Products Revolution. But precisely what causes archae ologists of such widely differing perspectives as those listed above to believe that a change in gender relations and/or their representation did indeed take place during this period? One aspect has already been mentioned?the strong male-female distinctions which are the main feature of Corded Ware burials (cf. Neustupny, 1973), but this is certainly not the earliest period at which male female distinctions are found in burials in this region and the question must be examined more closely. Once again, recent work on the lake villages provides one of the best contexts for documenting these issues and the Petrequins' outstanding synthesis (1988) rises to the challenge of addressing them. The MN occupation of the Jura lake sites finishes ca. 3400 BC, and when they are reoccupied ca. 3100 BC one finds a new emphasis on bows and arrows, stone hammer axes, flint daggers, and various kinds of ornaments. Arrowheads are found in larger numbers and a greater variety of types, many derived from southern France, although most arrowheads are made from local materials. The level of technical skill going into the manufacture of arrowheads also increases. Since hunting was beginning to decrease in practical importance at this time, the attention devoted to the arrowheads is an indication of the symbolic impor tance of the bow, which became, like the hammer-ax and the dagger, a symbol of a new male status (Petrequin and Petrequin, 1988, p. 105). The hammer-ax types at least, if not the objects themselves, come from the Paris Basin, to the northwest, while the flint daggers certainly come from the mines at Grand Pressigny 380 km to the west, at a time when similar long distance exchange of mined flint was occurring widely in Central Europe (e.g., Tabaczynski, 1972); they occur in the lower level of Clairvaux IV, dating to before 3055 BC. The blades are hafted as daggers and seem to have been used as general purpose tools on the basis of wear traces. Despite the lack of local flint, there is little sign of reuse of broken blades, which the Petrequins postulate</page><page sequence="26">146 Shennan may be a sign of special significance. It seems extremely likely, given the copper color of the flint, that their desirability arose from the fact that they imitated the early copper daggers which were now appearing in regions to the east and south but were still extremely rare. At the same time there is also a sudden increase in the frequency of items of personal ornament, including thousands of imported beads from southern France made of such materials as steatite, marble, greenstone, and rock crystal. Types include the so-called "winged" pendants, of which the earliest examples represent, according to the Petrequins (1988, p. 110), male genitals, the first time that this male attribute appears in the area, precisely when bows and arrows, axes, and daggers become male attributes. Most of the imported items, with the possible exception of the ornaments, are male-associated. The Petrequins' view (1988, p. 129) is that there are in fact few archaeological traces of women, whether their status or their tools, but they suggest that the bifacially retouched flint side scrapers may have been a women's tool and point out that these were generally made of local flint. More generally in fact, at this time, exotic materials and aesthetic considerations played a decreasing role in those items of equipment which stayed in the house, while exotic materials obtained by exchange were sought out for male weapons and tools. This impression of relative values is confirmed by examination of the items left behind when houses were destroyed by fire: bows, arrows, and axes are hardly ever found. However, the mode of burial in the region at this time was generally a collective one, in burial chambers which seem to have contained all members of the community, men and women, with the exception of young children. The clearest evidence comes from tomb M XII in the LN-EBA cemetery of Sion Petit Chasseur in the upper Rhone valley, which probably dates to ca. 3300 3100 BC. In this collective burial containing more than 50 women, men, and children, there were extensive grave goods including arrowheads, strike-a-lights, bone points, and boars' tusks and beads, as well as a flint dagger, an antler harpoon, and a hammer-ax: in fact, an assemblage which parallels, in its con texts and the distinctions it makes, whose found on the settlements (Petrequin and Petrequin, 1988, p. 192). At the same time, from an origin in southern France, male representations increase in numbers (see below). What is particularly interesting about this pattern is that the cultural influ ences which are apparent are from the Mediterranean zone, and not from the north and east, as one might expect according to the long-standing view that the increasing emphasis on male symbolism was derived from the steppes or from social and economic changes arising in north-central or eastern Europe. However, around 2750 BC the situation changes in this respect, since at this time Corded Ware material appears in central Switzerland and marks a complete change in the techniques of pottery manufacture as well as in the</page><page sequence="27">Settlement and Social Change in Central Europe 147 repertoire of forms. At the same time, the Grand Pressigny flint dagger, which had not been accepted in this area in the preceding Horgen phase, is included in the local repertoire of male symbols, in addition to the hammer-ax, while attributes of Corded Ware pottery are incorporated into pottery decoration in areas to the west such as Chalain-Clairvaux. Changes in social patterns can be well seen in the later tombs of the cemetery at Petit-Chasseur: grave goods generally decrease in number and weapons and metal items are restricted to only two or three male burials in a population of a few dozen people. Perhaps the most striking aspect of this period around the middle of the third millennium in the west Alpine area is the anthropomorphic stelae found at sites such as Petit-Chasseur, but also in Remedello culture contexts in northern Italy, where individual male weapon burials also occur. The stelae seem to represent male figures wearing belts, necklaces, and presumptively copper spi rals but, most characteristically, what are clearly copper daggers. In the Chalain-Clairvaux area the male-associated significance of arrow heads continues into the mid third millennium, as is made clear by the variety of exotic materials from which they were made at Clairvaux ca. 2600 BC. Perhaps, as the Petrequins suggest (1988, p. 209), the possession of arrowheads of exotic materials was an indication of success in exchange transactions; there is no reason to believe that they were more effective than those made of local flint. At the same time we have, they argue, convincing evidence for the assump tion that women were the potters, in the size of the fingerprints on the impressed cordons decorating the pottery. The lack of such evidence is, in general, one of the main problems in inferring aspects of the sexual division of labor and relating it to aspects of gender symbolism and to issues such as the relative values attached to male and female work. The Petrequins on the whole accept the conventional identification of certain kinds of activities and artifacts as male and other as female, albeit with some support from such evidence as that above or from burials. On this basis they suggest that there is an asymmetry between men, who, as we have seen, have access to exotic materials obtained by exchange for such things as hammer-axes, daggers, and arrowheads, and women, whose tools remain in the domain of the local and regional; they also argue that women were under equipped with tools compared with men and that, in ideological terms, this was taken as a sign of their subjection. Thus women were excluded from prestige goods even though they participated fully in the work of the community. At the same time, as men invested increasing amounts of energy in the competition for prestige items, they simplified the manufacture of domestic tools of stone, bone, and antler to save time, a process which itself had repercussions for gender ideology since it devalued the domestic realm with which women were associ ated. This pattern of a male-oriented ideology seen in the western Alpine area</page><page sequence="28">148 Shennan and in the Remedello culture to the south of the Alps is matched on the northern side by the Corded Ware of northeastern Switzerland, where Corded Ware burials of the characteristic type described above?individual burials under round burial mounds with polished axes and decorated beakers?occur, for example, at the site of Schofflisdorf ca. 2500-2400 BC (Schweizerische Gesellschaft fur Ur- und Fruhgeschichte, 1986, p. 142). An important recent analysis of northern Italian petroglyphs dating to the LN and EBA points in a similar direction to that described by the Petrequins for the west Alpine material in terms of the growth of gender ideology (Robb, n.d.). Weapon symbolism, whether in grave goods or representations, is linked to males. In hunting scenes weapons are used by males, while on stelae halberds, axes and, particularly, daggers are consistently used to distinguish males from females. Furthermore, although we know from bone assemblages that a variety of animals was hunted, the only one commonly represented in art is the deer, and in particular the stag with its antlers; if the gender of hunters is represented it is male, distinguished by a phallus. Images of plowing show a similar situa tion?oxen represented in particular by their horns and those using the plows frequently identified as male. It is very plausibly suggested that the various representations have a common pattern to do with the expression of male gender: daggers, male hunters, male plowmen, oxen, and stags: "Scenes using these ideologically highlighted symbols emphasize the maleness of both subject and object. The male vitality of the animal, symbolized visually through horns and antlers, implies the male strength of the hunter killing it or the ploughman controlling it" (Robb, n.d.). Together with various aspects of social life in these societies about which we can only speculate, these representations would have contributed to an ide ology of male power in which the male-female distinction was a hierarchical one and women were excluded from at least the public power structure. The dagger was the key icon in representing this, and it was this role which was the source of its public use, rather than its "prestige" as such, although as we have seen earlier, it was male status items which were made of exotic prestigious materials. The distinctions defined through prestige competition on this view were not those between elite and commoner but between male and female: although prestige goods circulated, there was little formal stratification, political or economic: "Distinctions among males were probably due to differential real ization of an ideal to which all males had access; they were competing for priority . . . , while excluding females" (Robb, n.d.). How far should we see this public ideological symbolism as representing "real life," or rather, since a clear distinction between ideology and reality is unsustainable, how far did it affect daily life and were women encompassed within it? The last question is perhaps impossible to answer, but on the basis of the evidence presented by the Petrequins which we have reviewed above, it</page><page sequence="29">Settlement and Social Change in Central Europe 149 appears that we are dealing not "merely" with symbolism but with a systematic pattern of day-to-day practices which devalued the domestic, with which women were associated. The pattern we have described, albeit in different forms, was present over the whole of Central Europe, and more widely as well, by the late third mil lennium. Small-scale societies in dispersed groups practised varying combina tions of plow agriculture and stock-rearing. Population flows no doubt occurred between neighboring regions with different population densities. Rituals and cultural practices had changed very considerably. The role of separate ritual specialists carrying out their activities at special places had been replaced by a more generalized notion of social efficacy attributed to adult males and, in many places, associated with the consumption of psychoactive substances such as alcohol. This male-oriented ideology valorized male activities at the expense of female ones and was oriented around values centered on hunting, violence, and the importance of exchange activities for obtaining exotic materials; the domestic domain was in effect symbolically devalued. While men and women were sym bolically unequal, males were symbolically equal, although no doubt varying in their prestige according to their role in local kin groups and their success in prestige-creating activities. How did this pattern develop in the course of the Early Bronze Age? In the last two decades the social organization of the EBA has been a major focus of interest (Shennan, 1975, 1982, 1982a, 1986a; Gilman, 1976, 1981, 1990), since it has been seen as the key period for the development of social ranking and stratification in temperate Europe. The basis for this view has been the appearance of rich burials and settlement hierarchies. The main argument has been over whether the development was the result of new possibilities for the control of subsistence resources, or rather of people via their subsistence resources, which the agricultural changes of the Secondary Products Revolution provided, or whether control of prestige goods was more important (Gilman, 1981, 1990; Shennan, 1987). As is generally the case with such debates, it is increasingly clear that the picture is more complex than imagined and that aspects of the two models can be integrated with one another; thus, the importance of increasing flocks and herds may lie not directly in the possibilities of control of a subordinate population that they provided, but in the production of prestige goods for competition. Furthermore, the notion of the existence of an original egalitarian society out of which hierarchy and inequality emerged, and the idea that this was one of the great transitions in the human story, has been increas ingly challenged (e.g., Flanagan, 1989). Inequalities can and do exist in soci eties without material inequalities; the fact that they are symbolically defined in cosmological schemes does not mean that they do not affect day-to-day activi ties. The same contrast between male and female that we have seen in the north</page><page sequence="30">150 Shennan Italian petroglyphs and the LN material of the western Alps is also apparent in the EBA cemeteries of many areas of Central Europe, especially those where metal goods were being deposited. However, there are some differences. In the eastern part of Central Europe, at least, for example in the cemeteries of the Nitra group of southwest Slovakia, dating to the Al phase of the EBA, before 2000 BC, women were buried in costumes which sometimes included consid erable numbers of ornaments made of metal, which there is every reason to believe was the most important prestige material (Shennan, 1975, 1978). In the light of the indications above concerning the role of males in the obtaining of exotic materials, it seems likely that the metal was obtained through males and Susan Shennan's original suggestion, that the costumes were obtained by women on marriage as an aspect of bridewealth associated with female exogamy, remains convincing. However, it may also be taken as an indication of a development in the male-oriented ideology which has been described, along the lines sug gested by Robb for a much later period in northern Italy, in that while female ornamentation can represent the subordination of women as a category to men, it can also represent distinctions among women which, we have suggested, may be a reflection of the success of the group into which they married. There were recognized sets of ornamentation associated with categories of adult female status, but only those who were wealthier could fully attain them: in this view, there were different degrees of womanhood, although all were, in effect, defined by the dominant ideology as inferior to male identity. Clearly this presupposes growing differences among men too, and Susan Shennan (1975, 1978) argued that such differences did exist, although only at the intracommunity, or rather intracemetery, level, and that they suggested the possibility that aspects of such rank and status were inherited patrilineally. No Nitra Group settlements were available with which the results from the ceme teries could be compared, but the evidence from the Traisen valley in Lower Austria discussed above, where both settlements and cemeteries do exist, indi cates that the burial community must have included groups of small settlements and suggests that it was within such larger units that the social distinctions discussed were operative. The recent publication of the cemetery of Gemeinlebarn F (Neugebauer, 1991) in the Traisen valley adds support to these suggestions and indicates the way in which this pattern developed, for whereas the Nitra group burials date to the Al phase of the EBA, before 2000 BC, Gemeinlebarn F is a short-lived cemetery belonging to the A2b or Langquaid phase, with a calibrated date (from charcoal of unspecified type) of ca. 1880-1680 BC. Here again is the same differentiated pattern for males and females, male graves containing weapons, and female ones often large quantities of ornaments, where they have not been robbed. The prestige weapons are now much more elaborate, however, and include decorated axes of eastern origin, while an</page><page sequence="31">Settlement and Social Change in Central Europe 151 exceptional female burial from the later part of the nearby cemetery of Franz hausen I has a remarkable metal headdress (Neugebauer, 1987): in general, the graves at Gemeinlebam F had been heavily robbed, and only a small proportion of the metal grave goods once deposited remained. It was, however, possible to show that grave pit size correlated with wealth of grave goods and scale of robbing. On this basis, graves could be divided into "rich" and "poor," for both males and females. The physical anthropological analysis indicated that there was a statistically significant mean difference of 3 cm in the estimated height of males from the rich and poor groups, as well as differences in various other measures taken on the postcranial skeleton, whereas no such differences existed between the rich and the poor groups of female burials (Heinrich and Teschler-Nicola, 1991). Various possible explanations could account for this, and at present it is impossible to distinguish between them. The estimated size of the population required to produce the cemetery was 80-85 people, implying, as we have seen, a social unit larger than the hamlets found nearby at Franz hausen. Neugebauer (1991) suggests that there may have been three different family /lineage groups using the cemetery. For most of the EBA, such cemetery-using communities are the largest social units for which we have evidence, but shortly after the Gemeinlebam F cemetery ceased to be used, a fortified settlement appeared in the area at the site of Boheimkirchen (Neugebauer, 1987). This was the local manifestation of a widespread trend in Central European settlement patterns in the late EBA already noted in an earlier section: the apparent emergence of local two-level settlement hierarchies in many areas in a period of ca. 100 years either side of 1600 BC (Horst, 1990; Neugebauer, 1990). These are particularly prevalent in the more southeastern parts of Central Europe?for example, in Slovakia, Lower Austria, and Moravia?but they also occur elsewhere, including Poland (Gedl, 1985; Pieczynski, 1985) and central Germany (Simon, 1990). There are undoubtedly difficulties in defining the status of these settlements: Are they local centers or was there a growing tendency for settlements generally to be fortified or in defensible situations? We have already seen that the expan sion of settlement into the south German uplands certainly led to such a tendency (see above; Biel, 1987), so the question is whether there is any basis for distin guishing fortified settlements in other areas which did have a special role. Those in the more northern parts of Central Europe have still not been sufficiently investigated, but in areas such as southwest Slovakia there do seem to be grounds for arguing that they represent the upper level of a settlement hierarchy. How ever, it is important not to get them out of proportion: in general, they are little more than 1 ha in area. In southwest Slovakia there seems to be roughly one per river valley, with inferred territories roughly 10 km in diameter (Shennan, 1982). The sites are certainly settlements and contain a large number of storage pits. They also contain evidence for metal working, in the form of molds, but</page><page sequence="32">152 Shennan Novotna (1983) has pointed out that, in general, these are for small decorative items and do not imply large-scale production; in fact, many sites produce evidence of metal working activity, which must have been widespread rather than centrally controlled. Decorated bone horse gear and other bone ornaments, generally assumed to be of local manufacture, are also found on the fortified sites, but perhaps most importantly they have considerable indications of the use of exchanged materials, including prestige metal work of Carpathian origin and amber deriving ultimately from the Baltic (Shennan, 1982b, 1986a). At the same time innovations in weaponry were also coming into Central Europe from the Carpathian area: the spear diffuses westward (Rittershofer, 1983), as do the first swords, developed from earlier daggers. It seems appropriate to see this pattern in general terms as representing the emergence of classic simple chiefdoms in the context of increasing competition and warfare. The generalized male ethos which characterized the later third millennium and was beginning to change at the beginning of the second was transformed, in some regions at least, into a warder ethos with clear social divisions among adult men, indicated not just by the settlement hiearchies but also by the hoards of specialist high-quality metal work which are found (see, e.g., Rittershofer, 1983) and the burial differentiation already discussed. It is of considerable interest to compare this situation which emerged at the end of the EBA in southeastern Central Europe with that in central Germany, because it makes the point that not all EBA hierarchization processes were similar in nature. The rich EBA burials of central Germany, which stand out strikingly against a background of graves with extremely poor goods, have long been a focus of arguments concerning the growth of social inequality in the European EBA; it tended to be assumed that they emerged late in the EBA as the culmination of a social evolutionary process similar to that producing the settlement hierachies just discussed. However, Shennan (1986a) suggested that while these emerged from processes of competition, the rich central German burials arose in condi tions of monopoly. This argument can now be developed in the light of the absolute dating of the burials (Becker et al., 1989) and Walter's (1990) discus sion of the EBA-MBA transition in central Germany. As we saw above, the Leubingen and Helmsdorf burials, the two best known of a larger group, have now been dated to just before 1900 and 1800 BC, significantly before the late EBA developments just described. Furthermore, the majority of the well-known hoards of fine artifacts from this region, such as halberds and metal-hilted daggers, also belong to this phase (Walter, 1990). Subsequently, the rich graves and hoards disappear, representing a decline in comparison with the Danube area. Furthermore, the late EBA/beginning MBA Carpathian innovations in bronze types and technology are not taken up, while</page><page sequence="33">Settlement and Social Change in Central Europe 153 there is a decrease generally in the number of finds until the developed MBA (Walter, 1990). This pattern of rise and decline sits oddly with the standard view that the rich burials and hoards appeared thanks to the exploitation of rich locally avail able metal resources which became a major source of Bronze Age copper and tin. Walter (1990) is skeptical of the role of local sources and copper production, given the lack of evidence for it and what he regards as their relatively restricted potential in the light of the level of EBA smelting technology, and suggests that it was salt production (Matthias, 1976) rather than copper production which led to the temporary concentration of wealth in this area (although it is worth point ing out that the Neolithic exploitation of salt in southeastern Poland did not lead to local accumulations of wealth). The situation in Central Germany also con trasts very markedly with that in the known copper source zones of the eastern Alps and adjacent areas, where copper production is not associated with con centrations of prestige artifacts but hoards of raw material in standardized units (see Shennan, 1992). It is suggested here that central Germany's pattern is best understood if one supposes that it was on the periphery of the zone of metal production and that it represents the new possibilities which existed for the monopolization of the large quantities of metal which were just becoming available from the east Alpine sources, in societies with exchange patterns associated with the interests of small-scale local hierarchies in terms of the gaining of prestige; local salt resources may have given central Germany an edge in this respect. However, this potential for prestigious metal consumption in the form of singular items (Kopytoff, 1986) was short-lived, in that quantities of metal had simply not been available at an earlier date, while later they were so great, deriving from an area outside local control, that metal could no longer be monopolized as it had been. In contrast, the south Central Europe growth pattern, as we have seen, continued into the MBA, down to ca. 1400 BC, characterized as it was by local site and social hierarchies. The links between these were competitive as we have already suggested. Although prestige competition between males no doubt con tinued within the local polities, it was now the between-group competition which defined the conditions of social and economic life. Those groups which for whatever reason had managed to attain greater power within a particular local area still needed to maintain it through the accumulation of wealth, derived from both subsistence and exchange, and followers. To see this as simply involving the development of coercion and exploitation through competing protection rack ets (Gilman, 1981, 1989) does not do justice to the subtlety of the processes involved. Once again the ideas of Robb (n.d.) concerning the LB A in Italy may be relevant here, continuing the discussion above of the EBA cemeteries and their significance, since similar patterns are visible to those seen at the end of the</page><page sequence="34">154 Shennan EBA in southern Central Europe. It is suggested that strategies for different men could have gradually diverged, in that well-situated groups could have used their success in exchange and/or subsistence production to attract followers, which would have led to further success. As such central groups became more pow erful, independent peripherally situated men and their groups, on the other hand, would have faced increasing difficulties in gaining prestige and as a result in reproducing themselves physically and socially: 'They may have accepted sec ond-class status in a powerful unit as a route to personal power more effective than life without powerful friends and relations. The result would have been the simultaneous enlargement of [some] units and differentiation within [and between] them' (Robb, n.d.; words in brackets are my additions); in addition, competition would now have emerged between these higher-level units, and followers would have become vulnerable to the depredations of their leaders' competitors and, thus, yet more dependent on their own leaders. The growth of such a differentiated warrior ideology out of the more gen eralized male one and its wide prevalence at the end of the EBA are further seen in the wide distribution of similar prestige weapons to which reference has already been made, although how far any actual fighting went down the social hiearchy is not clear. However, given the small size of all settlements, including the fortified ones, during this period, it is important not to exaggerate the scale of any of these processes. EARLY METALLURGY It may seem rather odd that in the account of social and economic change presented above, ending in the emergence in some areas at least of small-scale local chiefdoms, metallurgy has played only a tangential role?all the more so in that the period under discussion includes the beginning of the Bronze Age, regarded until recently as one of the major transformations in European prehis tory. However, in the last 20 years it has become clear that materials were exchanged on a large scale during the Neolithic, as we have seen above; that there was a "Copper Age" of a long duration and considerable copper produc tion in southeast Europe long before the beginning of the EBA; and that the conventional beginning of the Bronze Age, and the beginning of a bronze indus try, occurred in many places in a context of local cultural, social, and economic continuity. In the light of these arguments, we have to ask whether there was anything special about EBA metallurgy and to consider, albeit briefly, its role in the changes outlined above. It is certain that copper was circulating in various parts of Central Europe from the beginning of the period with which this paper is concerned, and even earlier (e.g., Strahm, 1991). It is also apparent that it was a valued material as well as being rare and difficult to obtain: the various imitations of copper items,</page><page sequence="35">Settlement and Social Change in Central Europe 155 such as the Grand-Pressigny flint daggers discussed above, are evidence of this, even though the amount of copper in circulation during the fourth and early third millennia was undoubtedly much greater than that which entered the archaeological record. A recent study of archaeological occurrences of copper in comparison with historical references to its use and circulation, in an Inuit context (Morrison, 1987), demonstrates clearly the considerable contrast between circulation and deposition which is apparent when we have information on both. Local sources of oxide ores were exploited in various regions when they were discovered, such as the superficial deposits in the eastern Alps which led to the briefly metal-rich artifact inventories of the Mondsee culture of Upper Austria in the mid fourth millennium. However, these sources were small in scale, and when they were exhausted copper supplies were affected accordingly until the chance discovery of new ones. The essential simplicity of much of this copper "industry" is worth empha sizing, since it was assumed until very recently that during the course of the later fourth and third millennia it showed increasing technological development and sophistication. It was believed, for example, that the use of arsenical copper during this period was an indication of the use of more complex copper ores than the oxide ores previously used, and even of deliberate alloying designed to produce a harder product more tractable in casting. It is now emerging, however, that the early arsenical coppers probably derive from arsenates asso ciated with malachite in the oxidized zone of ore deposits (Rapp, 1988) and that high arsenic contents can be the result of very simple smelting practices at relatively low temperatures (Budd et al., 1992). Furthermore, the majority of items made with arsenical copper are too low in arsenic for it to make any difference to the properties of the metal, and even in those cases where it was high enough to produce a harder metal if appropriately worked, metallographic examination has shown that the working was generally not carried out; the metal was left in a soft state and its potential not exploited, as Budd (1991, 1992) has shown for Mondsee axes; furthermore, its improved casting properties have also been called into question (Budd and Ottaway, 1991). Finally, some items at least once believed to have been cast in closed two-piece molds may not have been; examination of several such pieces has shown that they were initially cast in open molds and then subjected to extensive cold working (Budd, 1991). What characterized the metallurgical development of the core area of Cen tral Europe in the course of the EBA was the overcoming of these technological limitations. Whereas regions such as Britain practiced a Copper Age technology when metal production started there in the EBA, in Central Europe at the same time the techniques were developed to exploit the sulfide ores of copper-chal copyrite and the Fahlerz ores?and were applied to the vast copper resources of the eastern Alps, and no doubt to others in the Carpathians about which far less</page><page sequence="36">156 Shennan is known. This did not occur until the later part of the Al phase of the EBA, toward 2000 BC. In the Alpine part of the valley of the river Salzach, where the Mitterberg and related sources are located, the process of sulfide ore exploitation is clearly traceable. As we noted above in a different connection, both archaeological and pollen evidence indicates that after the late fourth millennium Mondsee phase occupation of the area, it was largely, if not entirely, abandoned. Evidence of large-scale forest clearance, especially on the upper parts of the slopes, and of the foundation of numbers of settlements indicates a major expansion of human activity in the period beginning ca. 2000 BC, associated with the start of the increasingly large-scale exploitation of the local copper sources, which is also archaeologically evidenced. Recent work suggests that, in the early stages at least, this was carried out by small independent groups but that later it may have become centralized (Shennan, 1989, 1992). The exploitation of such new sources as these put more metal into circu lation than at any time previously, and they were, to all intents and purposes, inexhaustible. The Mitterberg sources, for example, were exploited for over a thousand years. It was this new scale of metal production and availability, combined with the more or less contemporary development of the tin-bronze alloy with an understanding of its properties, which made the Bronze Age even tually different in terms of metallurgy and its impact from what went before it. This development occurred during the EBA in Central Europe, and the tech nology and its impact spread only gradually. What was that impact? The details of the argument are presented elsewhere (Shennan, 1992) but its basis is the suggestion that the new availability of copper was itself a stimulus to a greater bulk and velocity of social transactions and goods circulation, in the course of which copper and bronze became increasingly important as unit quantities of metal rather than as restricted prestige items, and began to function in some respects in the role of a protocurrency, as witnessed by its availability in units of standardized weight: the metal was convertible for a range of other goods, services, and materials, as well as being convertible itself as time went on into weapons and tools. It was the effect of this expanding availability of metal which was suggested as the cause of the socioeconomic trajectory in central Germany discussed above. CONCLUSION This paper has outlined, albeit speculatively in many areas, a picture of complex social and economic change in Central Europe between 3500 and 1500 BC which represented a major change of direction from what preceded it. Although the significance of the period in this respect has long been recognized, recent work is rapidly changing our assessment of what is involved. In many</page><page sequence="37">Settlement and Social Change in Central Europe 157 areas, it now appears, the period began with decline rather than growth, for reasons which are currently unknown; this state of affairs is surprising in view of the general assumption that the Secondary Products Revolution was an inten sification process with expansive tendencies. The process of settlement disper sion which took place around 3000 BC was associated with significant cultural changes, including major changes in ritual. The new attention devoted to gender relations, and not simply to unidimensional patterns of social ranking, has revealed important aspects of the principles defining the stmcture of LN and EBA societies as opposed to earlier ones. These are probably connected with the changing ritual patterns just mentioned, which "democratized" ritual for men, but in doing so defined them as a category superior to the opposed category of "women," in contrast to the preceding ritual emphasis on membership of a specific local group, represented by its ritual officants. Bronze metallurgy arose as a result of technological developments rather than social demand, which had already existed for over a millennium, although it was greatly increased by EBA population growth. The significance of metallurgy was not the possibilities it offered for social control?this was an evolutionary dead end?but the fact that it increased growth and ultimately competition. Clearly, enormous amounts of work remain to be done in many different areas to develop and test this outline. Little has been said, for example, about specific exchange patterns, not least because metal sourcing remains an extremely problematical task. Much more work is needed with regard to the absolute dating of regional sequences so that patterns of settlement expansion and wealth dep osition in different areas may be correlated with one another in the understanding of interregional socioeconomic processes. Furthermore, it should prove increas ingly possible to carry out detailed investigations of the relations between set tlement history and localized processes of climatic change through the use of such sources as the climatic information available in tree rings. In the most general terms, I would suggest that at the end of the period with which this paper is concerned, at ca. 1600-1500 BC, much, if not most, of Central Europe was at the peak of a growth process producing increased population and prosperity, albeit with evidence of growing competition and warfare. The indications are, however, that this was not maintained and that, in some areas at least, population and settlement declined considerably before the beginning of the LB A (Schmotz, 1992). Work is now needed to document the reality and extent or otherwise of this decline and, if it appears to be genuine, to investigate the reasons for it. The succeeding LB A Urnfields seem to mark, in many respects, a new beginning. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I would like to thank Angela Close, Dr. M.
