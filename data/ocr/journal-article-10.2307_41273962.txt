<plain_text><page sequence="1">"URIZEN WHO WAS FAITH &amp; CERTAINTY IS CHANGED TO DOUBT": THE CHANGING PORTRAYAL OF URIZEN 'Dona HJEAS The data which Blake has left for a full account of Urizen can be called an embarrassment of riches; Urizen - in person or in principle - inhabits almost all the important poems, from the Poetical Sketches (1769-1783) to the last great fragment of 1 8 1 8, The Everlasting Gospel. Contrary to the notion of "static" Blake - originating with Northrop Frye's claim that "in matters of opinion Blake shows little variation .... His principles he held with bulldog tenacity all his life" (13)- I shall argue that in his central tenet, personified in the figure of Urizen, Blake is far from being monolithically stable, and the common critical consensus of Urizen as an essentially evil character is only tenable in the early poems. In The Four Zoas , which shall be the platform of our investigations, we witness remarkable changes in Blake's concept of Your-Reason. I shall suggest that beside the well-known Orc-cycle, a Urizen-cycle also exists, with all its regressive and progressive sides. I shall also argue that Blake, simultaneously with, though completely independent from, his German contemporaries Kant, Schelling and Hegel, developed his fundamental notions in ways strikingly congruity with their ideas about the necessity of evil and suffering for the achievement of maturity - ideas which later came to be considered as central Romantic tenets. Into his unique version of Man's educational journey, Blake incorporated a displaced theodicy - or rather psychodicy, with psychological forces rather than a single operative theos in the background - in which evil is justified as an important part of ontological development. Since the role of evil is given to Urizen - whose primary allusion to reason is unmistakable and whose appearance coincides with that of Tharmas, most commonly equated with the senses - his incorporation into the Blakean pantheon as an indispensable character marks a remarkable conceptual change between The Book of Urizen (1794) and The Four Zoas (1796-1807); the values represented by Urizen and - in a wider context - Enlightenment ideas, which -were formerly rejected, have become accepted arid appreciated as integral parts of Blake's visionary universe. It shall be pointed out that, rather than attacking Enlightenment notions, Blake transvaluated and annexed them on his own terms.

Ide through the brilliant comparative studies of David Bidney to the more traditional, though no less compelling, arguments of Northrop Frye and Harold Bloom. Most importantly, instead of using the customary Freudian interpretation of Urizen as the superego, we shall use as the main framework for clarifying our understanding of Urizen Lipot Szondi's theory of mental functioning, more precisely the personality typology based on the Szondi test, as I have found that the characters defined by the Szondi test show remarkable congruity with Blake's Zoas. The parallel is all the more valid as the Zoas - on one level of interpretation - are psychological entities, anthropomorphic psychic functions that make up the human mind: "in the Brain of Man we live, &amp; in his circling Nerves. / . . . this bright world of all our joy is in the Human Brain" ( The Four Zoas I, 1 1 :294-95). In Szondi's system, four basic drives are assumed; these four categories, which he calls "drive-vectors," have many affinities with Blake's Quatemals who inhabit Albion's, the Universal Man's mind. In my reading, 1. C vector: contact drive - corresponds to Tharmas (commonly interpreted as the senses/instincts; parallel to the Freudian id); 2. S vector: sexual drive - corresponds to Luvah (love, emotions; libido); 3. P vector: paroxysmal (convulsive or startle) drive - corresponds to Urizen (reason; superego); 4. Sch vector: ego drive- corresponds to Los (imagination; ego). Even as in mathematics the term "vector" applies to a complex entity representing directed magnitude, so also in Szondi's terminology "drive vector" refers to a definite drive quantity in a specific drive direction, "an entity in which the confluent drive needs and tendencies find expression" ( Experimental 11). Each of the drives embraces two reaction types, so eight specific "drive factors" can be differentiated. Every individual bears inherently eight basic drive factors; and is characterised by the quantitative variations of these determinants. Correspondingly, Szondi's typology of personality assumes eight different but interrelated categories, so that eight classes of people are defined by the dominance of certain drive factors.1 I have found that Szondi's descriptions of the basic categories, in other words his descriptions of the generic character traits that classify the groups of people belonging to these categories, are instrumental in unravelling textual idiosyncracies and complementing the occassionally missing links in the cause-and-effect relationship of the (non-linear and nonrational) narrative of pie Four Zoas. Consequently his conceptual framework is capable of offering a creditable interpretation of the considerably changed portrayal of Urizen. *** Urizen is first mentioned by name on Plate 5 of the Visions of the Daughters of Albion (1793), but traces of his main characteristics are present as early as the Poetical Sketches.1 As long as Blake's hypothesis was essentially twofold, it allowed for a fairly static character sketch of Urizen, predominantly 132</page><page sequence="3">to be associated with Jehovah and his laws, which from the very beginning were depicted as repressive. 17. All night beneath the ruins, then their sullen flames faded emerge round the gloomy king. 18. With thunder and fire: leading his starry hosts thro' the waste wilderness he promulgates his ten commands, glancing his beamy eyelids over the deep in dark dismay. ( MHH Plate 26-27) In the political trilogy ( America of 1793, Europe of 1794, and The Song of Los of 1795), especially in The Song of Los, Urizen is beginning to show some traces of the personality he is to become in The Four Zoas, although he is predominantly a political force, incorporating in his character numerous allusions to the fermenting political scene of the last decade of the eighteenth century (while retaining the traits of the God of Moses). His stored snows he poured forth, and his icy magazines He open'd on the deep, and on the Atlantic sea white shiv'ring. Leprous his limbs, all over white, and hoary was his visage. Weeping in dismal howlings before the stern Americans Hiding the Demon red with clouds &amp; cold mists from the earth; Till Angels &amp; weak men twelve years should govern o'er the strong: And then their end should come, when France reciev'd the Demons light. (Plate 4) As the visionary world of the poems becomes more and more refined and the outlines of a threefold system are beginning to emerge, the character of Urizen gets further enrichment. In the psychological trilogy (The Book of Urizen, The Book of Ahania, and The Book of Los of 1795), Blake's mythopoeia is outlined and Urizen is depicted as a religious, political, psychological, and mythological force operating simultaneously within a single individual and in the universe. In The Book of Urizen, which discloses most of Urizen's polysemous character, Blake adumbrates a number of ideas which will later be elaborated in The Four Zoas. We learn that Urizen once belonged to the Eternals but has set himself apart from the others, hidden, self-enclosed: "I have sought for a joy without pain, / For a solid without fluctuation / Why will you die O Eternals?" (Plate 4). Urizen's fear of futurity and of change, his preference for Being as opposed to Becoming, remains one of his most characteristic features. It is a fierce irony that this self-contemplating, abstracted, unprolific shadow of horror, with his laws and creation of the physical universe, is unmistakably associated with the Lord God: 133</page><page sequence="4">Lo! I unfold my darkness: and on This rock, place with strong hand the Book Of eternal brass, written in my solitude. Laws of peace, of love, of unity: Of pity, compassion, forgiveness. Let each chuse one habitation: His ancient infinite mansion: One command, one joy, one desire, One curse, one weight, one measure One King, one God, one Law. (Plate 4) It is here that Urizen - more clearly than ever before - espouses all three implications of his name, as reason, horizon, and fixer of boundaries.3 Urizen's essential interconnectedness with .Los - the interdependence between Intellect and Imagination - is depicted very subtly. Urizen's separation from the Eternals inevitably brings about Los's fall, as the former was rent from his side. It is also Los who forges Urizen a physical body; thus the creation launched by Urizen is completed. It is a striking fact that in The Book of Urizen, unlike The Four Zoas, the Eternals react to Urizen's self-righteousness with intense indignation, and it is indeed these Eternals who force Urizen (in chap. 3) to create his vast world against the quenchless flames of their fury. "By destroying the dynamic balance of contraries prevailing in Eternity, Urizen, very much against his intention, has brought about monotonous flux, unpredictable mutability and tormenting instability. These are the objective manifestations of Urizen's progressive spiritual dissociation from Eternal reality" (Kittel 129). Unable to tolerate the sight of the writhing Urizen and Los, and horrified at the appearance of the first separate female form, the Eternals complete the Fall by closing down the tent they have erected; by beating down the stakes, they make the disintegration of Intellect and Imagination irreversible. What comes after the Fall shows Urizen exploring his dens (patterned on Satan's journey through Chaos in Paradise Lost ) and the birth of the all- enwrapping Net of Religion from the sorrows of Urizen's soul. "And the Web is a female in embrio / None could break the Web, no wings of fire" (Plate 25). Urizen is no longer portrayed in the Urizen-Orc dichotomy (hence the admonition that the wings of fire are unable to tear apart Urizen's system) and the bipolar vision gradually gives way to a more diversified myth. While in the earlier poems the most frequently used words in connection with Urizen were despair, woe, wailing and weeping (later to be explicated), these notions are now complemented with two new ones. Urizen's alienation from the Eternals finds eloquent expression in a cluster of symbols of enclosure; the objective correlative for his desire for hiddenness and secrecy is the proliferation of caves, caverns, and recesses. Organically connected to these is the other group of symbols: nets, webs, traps, bindings, and enchainment. "Vision has its objective correlative in the landscape, it is born out of caves enclosing chains" (Rotenberg 92).4 It is interesting to note that both sets of 134</page><page sequence="5">symbols contribute to the comprehensiveness (and ambivalence) of Urizen, as the first group of images traditionally evokes an allusion to the unconscious - which one would expect to be incongruous with Your-Reason, the rational faculty. Much as with the net and' the web, these almost substanceless things appear to disagree with the general idea of Urizen as a character embodying the obsession with materialism. The Book of Ahania, generally regarded as a continuation of The Book of Urizen, is substantially different from the previous poem. With Ahania, Urizen's consort, introduced into Blake's visionary universe, Urizen is no longer depicted as an abstract and fairly generalized figure but - with a new overlay - he is shown as an individual in his family circle. As "in overlays, [where] the earlier version is retained as part of the final entity even when it is rejected" (Wilkie 8), Urizen's character is further refined. He is reflected through his son, Fuzon, who embodies all the repressed energies of his father, and his counterpart, Ahania, who recalls the days of their unfallen existence and laments for her much- changed companion. The double exposure technique is employed here to accentuate the difference between Eternal Intellect and fallen reason, and to show how "Urizen! Love! / Flower of morning!" (BA Plate 4) has become the flower of moMrning. Urizen's relationship with his son is a remarkable example of an unresolved Oedipal conflict: Fuzon's rebellion against his father takes on an unmistakably sexual colouring. Urizen subjects him to Promethean sufferings and crucifies him on the Tree of Mystery. Much of the Fuzon-Urizen conflict is transported to The Four Zoas where Fuzon's fate is echoed in the Los-Orc strife (basically in the allusions to Prometheus) as well as in the Urizen-Orc contention (in the allusions to the crucifixion of Jesus). The last piece of the psychological trilogy, The Book of Los, intersects The Book of Urizen at chap. 4 and re-tells the binding of Urizen. This time the fall is related from Los's point of view and discloses very little new information about Urizen's character. Having touched upon the Book of Urizen, The Book of Ahania and The Book of Los we can conclude that, especially in the first two pieces of the trilogy, we get not only a further enrichment of [Urizen's] personal history but also an immense enrichment of his mythic significance as an agent ubiquitous in human experience. Only at this point can we begin to understand that the tragically fallen form of intellect that Urizen embodies is operating simultaneously, as a single dynamic, in the spheres of politics, religion and the psyche. But his full realization both as character and as a mythic force is not accomplished until Blake works him into the gigantic fabric of The FourZoas. (Wilkie 17-18) 135</page><page sequence="6">In The Four Zoas the first brief mention of Urizen is made by Enitharmon, Los's Emanation. In her Song of Vala, Enitharmon gives her account of the fall, which in her interpretation started with Luvah's attempt to seize Urizen's Horses of Light, metaphorically indicating the desire of Emotions to usurp the role of Intellect; this version depicts Urizen - contrary to his portrayal in The Book of Urizen - as a victim of aggression. As this is the first account of the disintegration of Albion (and one does not yet expect more to come), it is likely to be etched in the reader's memory more than the subsequent accounts, however significantly it is altered by those sequels. The figure of Urizen is next evoked by Los, who reinforces the notion that in the Eternal world Urizen is associated with thinking/reason and light: "this bright world of all our joy is in the Human Brain. / Where Urizen &amp; all his Hosts hang their immortal lamps" (I, 11:309-10). Contrary to Harold Bloom's assertion that "the reference to Urizen as a prince of light is both an ironic glance at the Enlightenment, and an allusion to Urizen's new role as the Satan of orthodox tradition" (Commentary in Blake 950), we believe that since Blake - who was undoubtedly familiar with the gnostic idea; of light and darkness5 - assigned this significant attribute to Urizen, we may rather consider it as an intimation of the integration of Enlightenment values into his visionary universe. While the first two mentions of Urizen were basically recollections concerning his existence in Eternity, he then appears in the present (I, 11- 12:308-17). It is noteworthy that - contary to expectations based on our previously acquired knowledge of his character - Urizen is introduced into the world of the poem as a benevolent figure. However, we do not have to wait long before he starts taking up the characteristics he appeared to slough off for a moment. He declares himself "God from Eternity to Eternity" (I, 12:3 19) and a terrible destroyer. These disconcerting images are counterbalanced by the Nuptial Song of Los and Enitharmon, at whose wedding we see the recently militant Urizen as afflicted and thoughtful. With a sudden shift in the narrative we get a new account of the circumstances of the fall, this time from the messengers from Beulah, who relate the events in a way entirely different from that of Enitharmond. We notice a gradual refinement in Urizen's portrayal. He is at one moment a self-confident, powerful oppressor who in another moment suddenly turns into a vulnerable and insecure creature. This ambivalent oscillation between cruel tyrant and atoning, repentant individual (discernible all through this night and indeed all through the poem) is what we shall term as the Urizen- cycle. The first exultation over his recently-acquired power is soon replaced by dismay at the sight of chaos and death: First he beheld the body of Man pale, cold, the horrors of death Beneath his feet shot thro' him as he stood in the Human Brain And all its golden porches grew pale with his sickening light No more Exulting for he saw Eternal Death beneath Pale he beheld futurity (23:11-15) 136</page><page sequence="7">To ward off total annihilation he starts the creation of the Mundane Shell, using the energies of the consumed Luvah.. Urizen as the divine Architect is a peculiar character, as behind his pronounced zeal for his arduous task lurk other compelling feelings: woe and despair: "To him his Labour was but Sorrow &amp; his Kingdom was Repentance" (30:208). What comforts him in his moments of despair is the fact that, where chaos was, the wondrous outlines of the universe are now beginning to emerge. More importantly, he finds solace in his emanation, Ahania, who appears in the poem as a goddess in a shrine to whom Urizen burns incense, a fact that urges Alicia Ostriker to conclude that Urizen's attitude very much resembles neo-Platonically inspired sexual reverence which prefers women chaste, exulted, and static rather than adjacent and active (159). The Ahania of the following night - though no doubt submissive6 - is far from being inactive. She presents her account of the fall. Urizen, unable to tolerate the menacing vision and indeed the individual voice of his emanation, indignantly casts her out, making their separation - which was momentarily foreshadowed the previous night - complete and (until Urizen learns better) irrevocable. The casting out of Ahania has disastrous consequences. The Mundane shell is crushed to pieces, the mathematically constructed order gives way to chaotic waters; Tharmas's ceaseless billows wash into the ruins of Urizen's world. It is noteworthy that the images that proliferate here are those connected with chaos and fragmentation. Only here does the sea image occur in one primary concentration (Ide 130), implying the onslaught of chaos that accompanies the destruction of the physical universe. The separation of Ahania from Urizen also has a serious impact on Enitharmon, the only emanation not yet (completely) fallen. With the mildest emanation (Ahania) now disintegrated, the psyche's self-regulating powers seriously weaken and the domineering Female Will (a deteriorated form of Enitharmon) is beginning to appear. Finally, the casting out of Ahania, which signals the loss of his main source of comfort and inspiration, certainly effects Urizen, who, for the next two nights, appears in "A dreamful horrible State in tossings on his icy bed / Freezing to solid all beneath, his grey oblivious form / Strechd over the immense heaves in strong shudders" (TV, 52:171-73). Urizen himself is a ruin, and even as in The Book of Urizen, Los is assigned to forge him Â£f body. Although Los's binding of Urizen is transcribed from The Book of Urizen with only minor verbal changes to suit the versification of The Four Zoas, we witness crucial alterations in context. While in the minor prophecy Urizen's actions - his self-assertion and building of the universe - are depicted as utterly regressive, the Zoa is unequivocally motivated by his own vanity; here it is made explicit that he is a victim of the jealous conspiracy of Los and Enitharmon (II, 34:287-94). The conceptual changes between the two poems are remarkable. Together with the reassessment of the role of Urizen/reason and Los/imagination, in which Urizen is no longer depicted as a prevailingly evil character, even as Los is not an exclusively positive figure any more, we find that the cause and consequence of creation have also been shifted. In The Book of Urizen the 137</page><page sequence="8">destructive aspect of creation is emphasized; the myth focuses on - and broods over - the disruption of the original unity of the Zoas and their fall from their eternal station; in short, the poem is oriented toward the past. In The Four Zoas , the building of the universe - painful as it may be - is an inevitable step in the ontological progress of Man, and a teleological view of history takes the place of the previous yearning for eternal return, as we hope to prove shortly. In the first poem Los is compelled by the Eternals to take part in the Creation, whereas in the latter he works at the command of Tharmas and seems to extract sadistic pleasure in his task: "absorbd in dire revenge he drank with joy the cries / Of Enitharmon &amp; the groans of Urizen fuel for his wrath / And for his pity secret feeding on thoughts of cruelty" (IV, 53:191-93). The subtle changes shown by the intersections of the two poems, such as the substantially modified portrayals of Los and Urizen together with the prime role of Tharmas/senses as an essentially forward-pointing creation, confirm the premise that Enlightenment ideas have infiltrated into Blake's poems as a tenable assumption. We have seen how Urizen's continued rejection of Ahania turned destructive. Since she, like the emanations in general, is considered to represent the repressed contents of the Zoa, the process is similar to what Carl Gustav Jung described in the following way in The Structure and Dynamics of the Psyche : "When the unconscious counteraction is suppressed, it loses its regulating influence. It then begins to have an accelerating and intensifying effect on the conscious process. ... To begin with, this naturally facilitates the execution of the conscious intentions, but because they are not checked, they may easily assert themselves at the cost of the whole" (qtd. in Cramer 528). It is a remarkable fact that after his separation from Ahania and acquisition of a physical body, Urizen appears in the fifth night - a new phase in the Urizen-cycle - as a character who acquires our sympathy. As he recalls the days of Eternity and repents his past deeds in a most beautiful lament, one would anticipate that he is ready for regeneration. At this point the image level drops dramatically, pointing to the heightened significance of the passage.7 My fountains once the haunt of Swans now breed the scaly tortoise The houses of my harpers are become a haunt of crows The gardens of wisdom are become a field of horrid graves And on the bones I drop my tears &amp; water them in vain O I refusd the Lord of Day the horses of his prince O did I close my treasuries with roofs of solid stone And darken all my Palace walls with envyings &amp; hate (63:194- 97, 64:21 1-13)8 What follows, however, does not justify our expectations. As Urizen explores his dens in search for Ore in Night the Sixth, he encounters his daughters and ruthlessly curses them (much as Tiriel and Lear cursed their 138</page><page sequence="9">daughters): "That they may curse &amp; worship the obscure Demon of destruction / That they may worship terrors &amp; obey the violent" (68:44-45). But as he travels through the ruinous world,9 once so beautiful, his rage and aggression wanes and he soon repents his curse, again uncannily transforming into a character capable of rousing our compassion. There is a Sisyphean grandeur in Urizen's constantly aberrant efforts to fight against futurity, depicted in his repeated dragging upwards: Oft would he sit in a dark rift &amp; regulate his books Or sleep such sleep as spirits eternal wearied in his dark Tearful &amp; sorrowful state, then rise look out &amp; ponder His dismal voyage eyeing the next sphere tho far remote Then darting into the Abyss of night his venturous limbs Thro lightnings thunders earthquakes &amp; concussions fires &amp; floods Stemming his downward fall labouring up against futurity (72:180- 86) His heart sickens at the sight of the horrible ruin, at once an external landscape and an internal mindscape, in which he feels his own fate reverberating, even as the original trauma of the separation and fall is repeated in his stumbling over hills and vales of torment and fear and his falling into the bottomless vacuity. Harold Bloom notes that these climactic passages of the sixth night describe "more brilliantly than any I know in literature, the onset of the phenomenological disorder, the first signs of man's sick consciousness" ( Blake's 240). It is ironical that from this sick consciousness there emerges the Web of Religion ("A living Mantle adjoind to his life &amp; growing from his Soul" [73:246]), a process described in The Book ofUrizen. Until the much-disputed Night the Seventh, "Blake's epic has lacked a true hero, quite deliberately, for in fallen worlds where all action is equivocal, no hero can exist. The principal protagonist of most of The Four Zoas has been Urizen" (Bloom, Blake's 246). After his cumbersome journey, Urizen has now reached the Caves of Ore, anci the moment is ripe for the encounter of the two extremes, energy (albeit restricted) and ratio (far from being rational). Wilkie and Johnson - somewhat debatably - find that the ensuing dialogue between closed-mindedness and unthinking rebelliousness - between age and youth, fascism and anarchy, superego and libido, visiting bureaucrat and jailed hoodlum - is a display of antagonism for its own sake. Though it settles nothing in the plot, it affords exhilarating emotional relief to readers, who recognize primordial forces in the psyche as they act in familiar personality types. (143) It seems more appropriate to suggest that the dialogue serves to accentuate the notion of lack of differentiation in the conflict: "The more our characters tend to see one another in terms of black and white, the more alike 139</page><page sequence="10">they really make one another. . . . The more these characters deny the reciprocity among them, the more they bring it about, each denial being immediately reciprocated" (qtd. in Bidney 129-30). Although it is customary to consider Urizen's approach to Ore to be motivated by fear and uncertainty about the latter's true identity, we would rather entertain the possibility that Urizen's intentions here are honest and his words genuine rather than hypocritical when he says, "Pity for thee movd me to break my dark &amp; long repose / And to reveal myself before thee in a form of wisdom" (VII, 78:57-58). This idea is supported by the fact that it is in the moment of the first great enlightenment, at the end of the fifth night, that he sets out to find Ore, as he feels the deep pulsation (caused by the bound demon's awful limbs) shaking his own caverns - an eloquent proof of their essential interconnectedness.10 With a sudden shift, however, Urizen turns into an impostor, declaring himself God, and from his books (the most characteristic attribute of his fallen existence) he reads out his (in)famous sermon, as hypocritical as it can be: "Compell the poor to live upon a Crust of bread by soft mild arts / Smile when they frown frown when they smile &amp; when a man looks pale / With labour &amp; abstinence say he looks healthy &amp; happy" (80:1 17-19). 11 From this moment on, up until the end of the eighth night, this aspect of Urizen remains dominant. In the seventh and eighth nights the crucifixion of Ore and Jesus is repeatedly depicted. Urizen at this most degraded stage is associated with Rahab, and it is this connection that causes his ultimate fall. As "Forgetful of his own Laws pitying he began to Embrace / The Shadowy Female" (VIII, 106:420-21), he degenerates into a horrifying beast. In a passage central to our subsequent analysis of his character, a brilliant synthesis of the previously oscillating vulnerable and irascible facets of Urizen, he is shown as becoming aware of his subordination to the force he sought to contain: now he finds in vain That not of his own power he bore the human form erect Nor of his own will gave his Laws in times of Everlasting For now fierce Ore in wrath &amp; fury rises into the heavens A King of wrath &amp; fury a dark enraged horror And Urizen repentant forgets his wisdom in the abyss In forms of priesthood in the dark delusions of repentance Repining in his heart &amp; spirit that Ore reignd over all And that his wisdom servd but to augment the indefinite lust (107:457-65) In the great night of the Last Judgement, the stirring Albion first summons Urizen, to whom he relegated his power at the beginning of Night the Second, and castigates him for all life's evil. Urizen repents; in a majestic speech of enlightenment, he casts forth futurity from his brain (realizing that "futurity is in this moment" /12 1 : 1 83/) and lets go of his former enmity with his fellow Zoas, relinquishing his claim to dominate - and, indeed, domineer - ^over them. Urizen is now ready for regeneration; he throws off his scaly form to reassume the human. He shakes off his aged mantles into the purging fire and 140</page><page sequence="11">"Then glorious bright Exulting in his joy / He sounding rose into the heavens in naked majesty / In radiant Youth" (121:291-93). 12 Even though he has regained much of his original splendour as a shining Apollo, he is not yet complete; he has yet to reunite with Ahania. Urizen embraces the exulting Ahania but she falls dead at his feet, an image genuinely difficult to account for. Perchance their union is premature because the integration of Ahania and Urizen is conditioned on the cooperation of all the Zoas, which will only come when Urizen starts his creative destruction as a Plowman. The colossal explosion of creative energy (whose like cannot be found anywhere else in English literature [Frye 305]) starts in the brain, where Urizen commences the plowing up of the ruined universe. As in isolation the tearing up of the ground may seem destructive, it is important to note that it is coupled with its contrary, and having prepared the soil to receive the seed, Urizen begins the sowing of the human souls. After this is done he takes a temporary rest when Ahania is restored to him, renewing his energies to reap the crop of the human harvest. With the apocalyptic images of Tharmas threshing the crop and Luvah gathering the vintage, everything is prepared for Urthona to make the Bread of Ages, the final phase in the Last Judgement. Blake's dream-vision ends with all the four Zoas restored to their proper place, and ultimately "all things are changd even as in ancient times" (138:845). It has previously been suggested that the principal protagonist of the first seven nights is Urizen, who remains an anti-hero up until the beginning of the Apocalypse. The hero who is finally designated to prepare for the revelation is Los, who, after starting the Last Judgement, disappears from the scene and gives way to the actions of Urizen. No wonder, then, that the very last glimpse we get of the regenerated world of the Zoas presents these two champions of the poem. The Sun arises from his dewy bed &amp; the fresh airs Play in his smiling beams giving the seeds of life to grow And the fresh Earth beams forth ten thousand thousand springs of life Urthona is arisen in his strength no longer now Divided from Enitharmon no longer the Spectre Los Where is the Spectre of Prophecy where the delusive Phantom Departed &amp; Urthona rises from the ruinous walls In all his ancient strength to form the golden armour of science For intellectual War The war of the swords departed now The dark Religions are departed &amp; sweet Science reigns (139:846-55) It is worthy of note that the glory of Urthona is straightforwardly depicted, even as his role in procuring the restoration of Albion is repeatedly accentuated, whereas Urizen is implicitly referred to in the last line, even as the indispensable part he plays in the regeneration is subtly concealed behind the actions of a genuinely ambiguous character, which shall be demonstrated presently. 141</page><page sequence="12">*** We have seen that Urizen has a privileged place in Blake's visionary universe; he seems to be a central concern of the poems. In Urizen's portrayal we witness a gradual change whereby, after being an antihero, he becomes an ambiguous figure with progressive potential. We shall now proceed to examine how his apparently randomly alterating characteristics subtly disclose essential conceptual changes. In our investigations of the Zoa of reason, who is the repository of Blake's deepest insight into the complexity of the human psyche, Szondi's typology of personality shall be used. Urizen bears all the important character traits that define people belonging to what Szondi calls the Category of Purism, Moralism and Atonement within the paroxysmal/convulsive drive - also termed as the startle drive (Lukacs 28). This category is the most important and unitary one with regard to the personality qualities of its members (Szondi, Experimental 184), and is the category of which the main features - to varying extents - are discoverable in every individual (Szondi, Kain 51), Similarly, Urizen (and not Los) gets a central role in the Apocalypse of the final night; the poem's ultimate concern is with the "resurrection to unity, with the restoration of full humanity to every kind and sort of human being. The Four Zoas is, in the end, not a justification of Blake's or the artist's ways but the justification of God's ways - which are the actions in time and eternity of the Eternal Man in all of us" (Wilkie and Johnson 237, emphasis added), a supreme example of Blake's self- transcendence as a Romantic artist, and a rendering of the Romantic aesthetic of art for man's (and for life's) sake. We have seen that the most characteristic features of the fallen Urizen were his violent explosions and subsequent repentance, similar to the people in this personality category, otherwise called homines paroxysmales (Szondi, Kain 51). The interpretation of this category is centered in the "paroxysmal storing up and sudden release of energy. In the Szondi test, epilepsy is interpreted psychologically as the purest manifestation pf the aggressive outburst" (Deri 88- 89).13 Epilepsy has of old been called morbus sacer (implying the compelling religious needs which denote the epileptic character), corresponding well to the figure of Urizen. The mounting aggressiveness and increasing irritability- which sometimes reach a point when the person feels a compulsion to injure somebody in his or her environment - is terminated by the actual attack, and is sometimes followed by CQma, a process clearly delineated in the Urizen-Ahania conflict in the third night, when Urizen's growing wrath (indicated by Ahania's intermittent remarks in the middle of her speech: "Why roll thy clouds in sick'ning mists"; "frown not Urizen: but listen to my Vision"; "O Urizen why art thou pale at the visions of Ahania" [41:71, 41:84, 42:91]) reaches its climax and he cruelly casts out his emanation: She ended, for [from] his wrathful throne burst forth the black hail storm 142</page><page sequence="13">Then thunders rolld around &amp; lightnings darted to &amp; fro His visage changd to darkness &amp; his strong right hand caine forth To cast Ahania to the Earth he siezd her by the hair And threw her from the steps of ice that froze around his throne (42-43:108-12) The coma-phase, following the attack, may be associated with the stonelike sleep and total inertia of Urizen the succeeding night. The last stage of the process, organically bound to the previous ones, is characterized by the individual's strict emotional control of his or her aggressive tendencies. This hyper-ethical - often hyper-religious - stage is the phase of atonement (Szondi, Kdin 97, Deri 88-89). This atonement of Urizen (which immediately follows the wrath-outburst-coma-sequence) is described in his great lament at the end of Night the Fifth: O Fool to think that I could hide from his all piercing eyes The gold &amp; silver &amp; costly stones his holy workmanship 0 Fool could I forget the light that filled my bright spheres Was a reflection of his face who calld me from the deep 1 well remember for I heard the mild &amp; holy voice Saying O light spring up &amp; shine &amp; I sprang up from the deep He gave to me a silver scepter &amp; crownd me with a golden crown &amp; said Go forth &amp; guide my Son who wanders on the ocean I went not forth. (64:214-22)14 The same process is depicted the next night, when Urizen curses his daughters and then repents his rash curse, with the exception that here the phase of atonement is even more distinctly pious, as from Urizen's laments the Web of Religion is born. It is this last phase that is most important in the Category of Purism, Moralism and Atonement. The category "reflects those aspects of the. personality which are closely bound to the development of the superego" (Deri 89), which is the kind of mental state unequivocally associated with Urizen. Members in this category are concerned with questions about "good" and "bad" in general; "the highly socialized ones turn into moralists, purists who are obsessed by the urge to purge and cleanse. They purge language, art, literature, styles, morals and 'improve' people and society" (Szondi, Experimental 185); similarly, one finds much antagonism between Urizen and Luvah and between Urizen and Ore, as well as the notion of Urizen as the lawgiver. This constantly recurring circle of wrath-outburst-coma-atonement is what we have termed a specific Urizen-cycle in the poem. Characteristic tendencies of this group of people, such as the ambition to be something great and to accomplish something of lasting importance, are all discernible in Urizen's Temple of secret religion and in his repeated claim to divine status. The most distinctive feature which makes Urizen an apt example 143</page><page sequence="14">of the category, however, is that "there is a certain stickiness to these personalities, which renders them incapable of ever leaving an object they once attach themselves to. . . . This clinging to objects is a highly characteristic trait of members in [this] category" (Szondi, Experimental 186). The objects Urizen clings to in his fallen existence are his books.15 Ever since the first mention of them in the sixth night, they remain inseparable from the Zoa. He carries them along as he drags through the ruined universe, no matter what difficulties they may present on this agonizing journey: But still his books he bore in his strong hands &amp; his iron pen For when he died they lay beside his grave &amp; when he rose He siezd them with a gloomy smile for wrapd in his death clothes He hid them when he slept in death when he revivd the clothes Were rotted by the winds the books remaind still unconsumd Still to be written &amp; interleavd with brass &amp; iron &amp; gold (71:167- 72) In the seventh night the books receive a heightened emphasis when Urizen is depicted as compulsively tracing his books ("Thundering &amp; hail &amp; frozen iron haild from the Element / Rends thy white hair yet thou dost fixd obdurate brooding sit / Writing thy books." [79:79-81]) and reading out his moral teachings. (The image is repeated seven times in the first 170 lines!) It is only in the overall destruction of the Last Judgement that "The books of Urizen unroll with dreadful noise" (118:33) and are consumed - together with the Spectre of Urthona, Tirzah and Rahab- in the raging fire. The process whereby the crude affects (like rage, hatred, resentment, vindictiveness and jealousy) accumulate, explosively discharge, and then change into a tendency toward goodness and righteousness was termed by Szondi as the Cain-Moses dialectics (our Urizen-cycle), in which the last or "atonement" phase is metaphorically called the Moses-complex ( Kain. 97, 269). Szondi claims - and we have indeed seen the same notion confirmed in the character of Urizen - that good and evil, sacred and profane, Cain and Moses are not negations but contraries, which creatively complement each other in the same person.16 A similar idea is put forth in esoteric symbology, in which Cain is regarded as being identical with Jehovah or the "Lord God" (Blavatsky 67). In Szondi's system the convulsive drive (also called the ethics drive) is personified by Moses, who is Cain turned into Abel ( Kain 94). It is striking to see that Urizen, too, is modelled on Moses, not only in the poems (hence his giving of the Ten Commandments and preoccupation with his books on morality) but also in the paintings and graphic works which depict Urizenic subjects. The visual portrayal of Urizen confirms his association with Moses, for in all the paintings he is almost a mirror-image of Michaelangelo's Moses. The first appearance of this typical face (in Satan , Sin and Death as well as Moses Receiving the Law) is around 1780, when Blake is done with his apprenticeship to James Basire (1772-1779) and is beginning to develop his unique style and figures. He later uses the same figure chiefly to depict 144</page><page sequence="15">Shakespearean subjects, notably for the illustrations to King Lear ( Lear Grasping his Sword of 1788), upon which he seems to have modelled Tiriel, an early version of Urizen. From the mid- 1790s, concurrent with his more and more frequent appearances in the poems, the character is variously called in the pictures as Urizen, Elohim, and Moses. What is the significance of the fact that Urizen is modelled on Moses, even as the corresponding Szondian category is personified by the Old Testament prophet? The most immediate explanation for the Urizen-Moses congruity is Blake's portrayal of his Zoa as the giver of the Ten Commandments, a lawgiver who thereby imposes intolerable limits on Mankind. Yet this restrictive function is only part of what he stands for. Much more important is the fact that, with the Ten Commandments, the rule of the priests ended; in other words, with Moses a direct and personal relationship between God and Man started - which was what Blake celebrated all through his poetry. The intimate relationship with God, albeit regulated by uniform laws imposed on Man from without, seems to encompass the whole program of Urizen17 and account for his portrayal as a paroxysmal character, within whom the Moses and the Cain traits oscillate. In his character the possibility of regeneration and the pain of generation are united. *** Seen in the light of the Cain-Moses dialectics, some traditional interpretations of Urizen as a villainous character might be challenged.18 These interpretations, as a rule, take into consideration only parts of Urizen's actions in the poem - those which correspond to the accumulation and discharge of the crude affects and which see the succeeding atonement phase as mere hypocrisy or fierce irony (on Urizen's and Blake's parts respectively).19 These critics regard the fall brought about by Urizen as a tragic incident, which shatters the original harmony and inflicts unnecessary pain and suffering on Man. The characters' intermittent nostalgic accounts apparently support this notion. They all describe "those blessed fields / Where memory wishes to repose among the flocks of Tharmas" (II, 34:325-26). The constant collation of the present world with those fields of bliss serve to accentuate the sense of loss and degeneration. Yet a closer look at the text reveals that the ideal(ized) state of Eternity cannot be identical with the highest ontological state, Eden 1 . Spiritual Eden for Blake is fourfold, whereas we learn from the Spectre that Eternity was threefold ("If we unite in one, another better world will be / Opend within your heart &amp; loins &amp; wondrous brain / Threefold as it was in Eternity" /VII, 85:354-56/), which indicates the world of Beulah, land of delusions, one step below the perfect condition. 2. The most definitive argument, which makes a revaluation of Urizen's role inevitable, is that the regenerated Albion, born in the colossal final night, is not the same as the one who had to fall because of the war among his members.20 An important change has taken place, as Luvah and Vala have been assigned a new place within the resurrected Man: "You shall forget your former 145</page><page sequence="16">state return o Love in peace / Into your place the place of seed not in the brain or heart" (126:364-65). As the final night is one jubilant exultation over the birth of the Eternal Man, we can rightly conclude that the fall - with all the torments it included - was not meaningless, and instead of the original coincidencia oppositorum, in the final night complexio oppositorum is achieved through the instrumentality of Urizen. This idea of ascending to a higher ontological state at the end of a circuitous journey dominated the thinking of many of Blake's German contemporaries, among them Schelling, who formulated the same notion: "I posit God as the first and the last, as Alpha and Omega, but as Alpha he is not what he is as Omega; and insofar as he is the first ... he cannot, strictly speaking, be called God; unless one were to say expressly 'the undeveloped God,' Deus implicitus , since, as Omega, he is Deus explicitus" (qtd. in Abrams 186). In Blake's painting, The Whirlwind: Ezekiel's Vision of the FourZoas , the Zoas are depicted as four male profiles, two on either side of the picture. As has been previously noted, the definitive trait of Ezekiel's Zoas is their unswerving motion; they respond unfalteringly to the divine will that commands them: "Their wings were joined to one another; they turned not when they went; they went everyone straight forward" (1.9). Analysing the picture, Goldsmith claims that with the double exposure of the Zoas, Blake tried to fabricate the illusion of a fourfold wholeness, but he only made manifest a set of internal contradictions, since "one cannot have straightforward motion without sacrificing the straightforward motion" (158). He implies that - by virtue of the illustration - one of the Zoas has to move backwards. The Zoa he identifies as bound to a retrograde motion is Urizen, whose withdrawal triggered the fall into generation. We shall try to argue that this apparent retrocession may in fact be progressive, and that Urizen, whose face is concealed from us, may be the only one facing the Divine Entelechy, watching over Man unseen in the background. Ideas about the redemptive value of suffering and about unruly affects serving a larger rational - albeit unforeseen - scheme were most remarkably summerized by Blake's famous contemporary, Hegel, whose system served as a point of departure for a number of Blake scholars.21 Blake's simultaneity of reference to internal and external events in The Four Zoas - the actions take place simultaneously within the consciousness of the human race over the course of history and within the mind of the individual in his or her lifetime - makes such a comparison especially apt. Philip Pomper's account of Hegel is easily applicable to The FourZoas of Blake: Hegel imagined history as a process and structured its development dialectically in a way that anticipates the psychoanalytic intelligentsia's theories of history. He made the kinds of connections between mental process and historical development that psychohistorians make in their language of psychoanalysis. If there is a psychology informing Hegel's dialectic and phenomenology of spirit, then it is reasonable to speculate that the appeal of his vision 146</page><page sequence="17">of history is in some way associated with it - that what appeals in it, in fact, is an intuitive developmental psychology. (26) The notion of the necessity of pain and destruction for the betterment of the world existed well before Hegel's Phenomenology ; it informed the Hellenic world, the teachings of Hermetic philosophy, and the apocryphal apocalypses as well as the Talmud.22 The Kabbalistic axiom, Demon est Deus Inversus , warns against a too hasty depreciation of Urizen's character. In the universe of the Zoas, he is cast the role of the evil, hence the predominance of "woe," "despair," "wailing" and "weeping" whenever he appears - he is weeping because of what he has done, and others are weeping because of what he has done to them. It is an uncongenial task that Urizen is assigned, though indispensable if Man is to become God. "If God is any thing he is Understanding. . . . Understanding or Thought is not natural to Man it is acquired by means of Suffering &amp; Distress i.e Experience. Will, Desire, Love, Rage, Envy, &amp; all other Affections are Natural, but Understanding is Acquired But Observe, without these is to be less than Man" {Annotations to Swedenborg's Divine Love and Divine Wisdom). Therefore Urizen's destructive benevolence - the first two phases of his paroxysmal character - is in the service of an unquestionably positive process: the divination of Man. This is why, in the poem, Luvah/Jesus is almost inseparable from Urizen. Urizen, too, is inseparable from Luvah. Urizen is the redeemer in a specifically Blakean sense, since through his agency Luvah - the historical, vegetated Jesus23 - is crucified and the only true Christ, the Divine Image, is incarnated.24 The pictorial evidence to justify Urizen's "crime" against Luvah appears in The Last Judgement in the Rosen wald collection (1809). While the first two versions of the same event ( A Vision of the Last Judgement [1806] in the Stirling Maxwell Collection and The Vision of the Last Judgement [1808] in the Egremont Collection) show the cross exalted into the heavens while Satan - entwined by the Serpent - falls downward, in the third drawing a crucial change is discernible. The cross is no longer exalted into heaven but is falling down, implying that the cross - commonly associated with the vegetated body of Christ - does not belong to (and indeed has no place in) the resurrected world. The World of Eden may not commence until Luvah has perished through the agency of Urizen. The paradoxical notion of Urizen as redeemer is in accord with the idea of the Oriental church fathers who - as Elias Canetti noted - "claimed that Christ was uglier than any man who ever lived. For in order to redeem mankind, he had to take upon himself all of Adam's sins and even his physical blemishes" (qtd. in Bidney 68). 25 The Urizen-Christ association can be detected in one picture dated approximately 1 820. Of the four extant copies of Jerusalem , three are black and white and delineate God in a Satanic form, but the latest copy is printed in colour and portrays the Creator as the radiant Jesus, the Saviour. One more interesting coincidence needs to be quoted which substantiates our hypothesis of Urizen as Redeemer. Paul Youngquist - quite unappreciatively - notes that Urizen embodies pure self-consciousness stripped 147</page><page sequence="18">of feeling and reduced to an automatic bodily response, in character prefiguring Camus's Meursault (94). It is striking that Camus, in his preface to the 1958 edition of L'Et ranger, remarks that Meursault is the only Christ we deserve (1929). 27 It has previously been pointed out that "stone" is closely connected with Urizen. The significance and role of stone in alchemy (whose teachings can be found all through Blake's poetry) appears to be the same as that of Urizen in The Four Zoas : it is allied to Logos and is phallic/creative in nature (Hars 77). The creation of the Mundane Shell, we learn from Blake, "was an act of Mercy" ( A Vision of the Last Judgement 91). Blake scholars - following Frye, who seems to have taken over the idea from Jacob Boehme - unanimously explain that the Creation was an act of Mercy because with its stability and permanence it put a limit on the Fall, forming a "barrier between our weak struggling lives and the total annihilation of all being in chaos" (138). Instead of this argument, we would rather propose another interpretation. It may seem just as appropriate to see the creation in the context of myths. Eliade notes that healing rites point to the contention that life cannot be restored; it can only be re-created by the reiteration of the cosmogonical act. The reiteration of this cosmic creation is expected to heal physical as well as spiritual maladies (123). Because Albion is sick, Urizen's act of creation is indeed a redemptive act of Mercy since it essentially effects Albion's recovery, which - in other words - means the Ancient Man's birth into a higher ontological state. We have seen that what is called sickness (death or sleep) on the level of the individual/microcosm is - on the level of the macrocosm - human history. Norman O. Brown,28 a notable contemporary psychohistorian, shows a striking allegiance to the Blakean idea of the interconnectedness between history and the diseased individual. He believes that history is a product of the innate weakness of the human ego and assumes that "other animal species are normal precisely because they do not have histories. Only man, the neurotic animal, has a history and he has a history because he represses himself. Repression creates the 'dialectic of neurosis,' which in turn is the dialectic of history. Historical cultures are all symptom-formations" (Pomper 130). Brown points out that in order to find a way out of history - that is, to recover from the deadly sleep into which Albion has lapsed - one has to display the weakness and its symptoms, which is precisely what happens in The Four Zoas. For all their similarities, one crucial difference between the two concepts needs to be noted. For Brown, the remedy is to restore to man his animal nature, which is the homeostatic, unconflicted, and ahistorical condition of animals in a state of nature (dualism, Brown asserts, signifies conflict, neurosis and continuous struggle; in short: history [Pomper 132]), whereas Blake believes that "once out of nature" and history, Man will live in a continuous intellectual strife. Blake's ultimate Brotherhood of Eden is philadelphia, which involves conscious acts and an unceasing mental effort to love brothers, rather than adelphos, a static state of brotherly community (Iazumi). What is born in the final night of the poem is this supreme state of higher innocence in which historical contingency has been eliminated, a state in which history/disease/death has come to an end. "From the earliest apocalyptic texts of 148</page><page sequence="19">Judeo-Christian Scripture to the experiments with apocalyptic representation by romantic writers, and on to various rhetorical strands within postmodernism itself, the idea of the end of history has often been bound up with the promise of an aesthetic space relieved of historical determinants" (Goldsmith 1-2). In the Apocalypse of the last night, this aesthetic space is achieved when Urthona, the eternal Artist, "rises from the ruinous walls / In all his ancient strength to form the golden armour of science / For intellectual War" (139:852-54). Blake's idea of the higher innocence, then, is very close to Schiller's notion of the aesthetic state, as both claim that it is in this state alone that we experience infinite human potentiality; "here alone do we feel reft out of time, and our human nature expresses itself with purity and integrity, as though it had as yet suffered no impairment through the intervention of external sources" (qtd. in Goldsmith 8).29 Although the supreme state is closely associated with Urthona, the Artist, it is notable that he alone would be incapable of attaining it. It has recently been pointed out that the most fundamental idea about the aesthetic space is that it is self-contained and completely devoid of historical determinants. As Los is the Eternal Prophet, he is closely associated with classical prophecy, in which history is always divinely motivated and implicitly endless. "Prophecy typically defines the furthest extent of redemption as a return to life as normal: 'They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit' (Isaiah 65.21)" (Goldsmith 31). Los the prophet, then, is not able to reach the ultimate aesthetic phase; he - by himself - could only lead Albion back to Beulah from which he fell. Albion's life has been so corrupted that more radical action is needed. This more radical action is apocalyptic redemption, which differs markedly from prophecy in its understanding of history. Apocalyptic redemption occurs as the abrupt end to history, when history has been so usurped by evil forces that it cannot function as the medium of divine activity (Goldsmith 31). The agent of this apocalyptic redemption is Urizen, a premise supported by two good arguments. 1 . Apocalypse "requires an itinerant prophet outside institutional stability and vigilance" (Goldsmith 54), a requirement undoubtedly fulfilled by Urizen, whose endless and painful travels - after his fall from Eternity - are so meticulously described in the poem. 2. Apocalypse is a "bookish" phenomenon; by the time John writes his apocalypse, the idea of an authoritative book has become indispensable to a vision of final retribution and salvation.30 At the end of The Book of Daniel, the prophet is ordered to "shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end" (12.4). The opening of the book and the end of history are considered to be simultaneous events (the same notion is repeated in Revelation with John's book, which is sealed with seven seals); the very act of opening a book that has been sealed until the end of time suggests that one has initiated the apocalyptic event. Urizen's preoccupation with the books to which he clings assumes a central role in the poem. On the one hand, the obsessive adherence to the books renders Urizen a perfect example of the Category of Purism , Moralism and Atonement. , hence a familiar character type. His oscillating facets (the Cain- 149</page><page sequence="20">Moses dialectics or Urizen-cycle), or the juxtaposition in his character of great good and great evil, is no longer to be dismissed or regarded as mere irony. On the contrary, Urizen carries in himself the central trope of The Four Zoas, the prevalent Romantic idea of life as a circuitous journey. On the other hand, the constant mention of Urizen's books seems to point to, and emphasize, Urizen's progressive role in the poem as agent of apocalyptic redemption.31 In The Four Zoas the ultimate aesthetic state is associated with Urthona as well as with Urizen, both being indispensable and complementary to each other, as their names - dark Urthona and the Prince of Light - subtly imply. The same notion is expressed by the senses that are attributed to them, Urizen being the eyes (eye=I?!) and Urthona corresponding to the ear. Of old, there has been pungent debate as to the primacy of one over the other.32 The ear has had a privileged place because it is known to be the last functioning sense of a dying man and also, in pagan and Christian iconography, the ear has often been substituted for the female reproductive organ through which new life can be conceived, a metaphorical indication of new birth and purification. As opposed to the supremacy of the ear, Augustine proposed that the most important of all the organs are the eyes, as it is with the help of visual perception (closely connected to the heart) that one can get closest to God. The only way of reconciling these two opinions is to accept both as inevitable and complementary as propounded by Paul in his first epistle to the Corinthians (12.12-18): For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ. ... For the body is not one member, but many. . . . And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? . . . But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. For the divination of Man, then, a synaesthetic union of eye and ear (the cooperation of Urfcen and Urthona) is inevitable; we must hear the word and see the light, as in John 1.14: "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory." In light of the above we may affirm the assertions that Urizen has an intrinsically progressive role in The Four Zoas and that in the poem Reason is just as highly esteemed as Imagination, to be substantiated textually, intertextually, and graphically. * * * 150</page><page sequence="21">"Blake is generally known for his inimitable lyrics. To the ordinary reader, his Prophetic Works are sealed with seven seals" (Ba-Han 4). What is the reason for these interpretative cruxes? My investigations have shown that preconceived ideas based on the minor prophecies constitute the main stumbling block and that Urizen cannot be considered as a monolithic character. The dichotomy of Reason and Imagination in the early poems is gradually replaced by a more diversified myth in which Urizen is portrayed as a polysemous figure. No longer the villain to be castigated for all life's evil, Urizen has a central role in ontological awakening. In his paroxysmal character, one finds an eloquent expression of the medieval idea that the "agents both of tribulatio and of renovatio are imperial and, indeed ... the line between the evil oppressor and the just chastiser is not very clear-cut" (Reeves 314) . NOTES 1 For a detailed discussion of these categories see Szondi, Experimental, and Deri. The Szondi-Blake oarallel is delineated in Csikos. 2 In "To Winter." Tiriel (1789), too, contains an early version of Urizen. "What strikes us is not that he resembles Lear, but that Lear resembles him. He seems to be the mythological ancestor upon whom Shakespeare patterns his historical king" (Youngquist 87). 3 For a remarkable visual portrayal see Frontispiece to "Europe. " 4 Discussing the symbols of the web and the net, Michael J. Cooke notes that the "web and the net are not entities, but entity-catchers and entity-trappers. Deceptively, yet revealingly, they are made up of a minimum matter and an abundance of nothingness. Their design, in both senses, makes them work, and not their substance" (445). * For Blake and gnosticism see White; Morton: Raine. 6 "And bright Ahania bow'd herself before his splendid feet / O Urizen look on Me. like a mournful stream / I Embrace round thy knees &amp; wet My bright hair with my tears" (111,37:2-4). Until the end of the poem Ahania remains entirely submitted to Urizen. She is the only emanation who never enters into an argument and h A* no sexual conflict with her Zoa. Alicia Ostriker likens her to "those other- victims of exacerberated and anxious male intellect, Hamlet's Ophelia and Faust's Grethchen." It is interesting to draw a parallel between Ophelia's "O what a noble mind is overthrown" speech and ANnia's recollection of "those sweet fields of bliss," even as it is worthy of note that when Hamlet rejects Ophelia and slays her father he shows remarkable similarity to Urizen when he casts out Ahania and defies Albion (Ostriker 159, 165). 7 "The overall pattern of alternation between areas of high and low image density, affects the reader s perception of the poem. ... A reduction in imagistic connotations places more emphasis on narrative meaning.. . . The text segments characterized by low image density are, for the most part, more plot oriented than the sections of the poem containing the densest concentrations of imagery" (Ide 128-29). 151</page><page sequence="22">8 Harold Bloom interprets "this piercing and self-deceiving ululation" as ironic and claims that Urizen's sorrow over the lost glory is simply a "dangerous nostalgia" (commentary by Bloom in Blake 957). Our understanding of the evidence is quite different, as shall be explained later. 9 "In mapping Urizen's journey Blake takes his terminology from the systems of Newton and Descartes" (Fuller 121). 10 Bloom - conversely - interprets Urizen's motive as an "unholy resolution to a sinister quest" {Blake's 235). It is interesting to note that Urizen, with his white hair and iron pen, tracing the wonders of futurity, is much more prophetic than the Prophetic Boy, who condemns Urizen's preoccupation with the future. 1 1 The unmistakable allusions of the passage to contemporary affairs urges Brenda Webster to conclude that "with his increased focus in revision on social evil, Blake tends to diminish Urizen's inner complexity and make him a stereotypical villain somehow responsible for life's evil" (235). Urizen's shaking off his aged mantles is emblematic of, and simultaneous with, his shaking off the accreted overlays. Indeed, exactly to the extent that more and more accreted overlays of evil encrust Urizen's personality, like barnacles, does he become a more and more clumsy, complicated, self-entangling machine. For him to regain his true integrated identity he must slough off his encrusted overlays, as we see him do in the last two Nights of the Zoas. He is able to achieve this redemption of himself because he espouses a kind of pluralism, by virtue of which he does only what is proper to him instead of usurping the roles of the other Zoas and Emanations - in other words, by allowing himself to be one overlay in the total human being instead of incorporating all the overlays into himself. The overlays the fallen Urizen has had to live with are a synthesis but also ... a merely 'synthetic' synthesis. (Wilkie 19) 13 Bidney notes that Urizen is "possessed by a daimonic rage for order, a rage with an irrational origin . . . and with predictably irrational consequences" (102). 14 As mentioned previously, we cannot agree with Bloom's interpretation of the passage as a hypocritical lament, but we rather presume that Urizen's words are genuine and his transformation is comprehensible and consistent since it is congruous with his (paroxysmal-epileptiform) character. 15 About Urizen and his books see Paul Mann, " The Book of Urizen and the Horizon of the Book." 16 Urizen's ambiguous actions recall the Lord's words to Jeremiah: "See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant" (Jer 1.10). The duality of Urizen's (paroxysmal) character is also noted by Vincent A. De Luca, who claims that the key term in the discourse of 18th-century sublime, "astonishment," encompasses Urizen's whole program, for his actions are as ambiguous as the term itself (which Blake used more frequently - 51 times - than any other major poet between 1660 and 1830). "Astonishment" simultaneously implies an internal and an external phenomenon. It denotes a psychological state and refers - by virtue of its 152</page><page sequence="23">form - to the powers of vegetated nature: thunder (from which it is derived) and stone (which it resembles in sound), both of which are unmistakenly associated with Urizen. His voice of thunder is carefully repeated to accentuate the Urizen-Jehovah identity. His association with stone is supported by a number of instances. Urizen's stony sleep following his separation from Ahania, his petrified heart ("be your hearts harder than the nether millstone" /VII, 80:112, /) and his rootedness in his iron rock (in Night the Seventh) are but a few such instances. Extratextually, the Urizen-Moses parallel implies his connection with stone. De Luca points out that Blake shows a strikingly persistent allegiance to Burke, whose definition of "astonishment" - as formulated in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime &amp; the Beautiful - is as follows: The passion caused by the great &amp; sublime in nature , when those causes operate most powerfully, is Astonishment; &amp; astonishment is that state of the soul, in which all its motions are suspended, with some degree of horror. In this case the mind is so entirely filled with its object, that it cannot entertain any other, nor by consequence reason on that object which employs it. Hence arises the great power of the sublime, that far from being produced by them, it anticipates our reasonings, &amp; hurries us on by an irresistible force, (qtd. in De Luca 1 01 ) "Astonishment," then, incorporates in itself a double potential: it either immobilizes or releases. Thunder may not only, petrify but may also crack open the stones "releasing our buried powers to freedom. . . ." The "astonishment" produced by this clarifying thunder encompasses the moment when surfaces and opacities are burst to reveal the infinite potential within" (102). This bipolar concept of astonishment finds eloquent expression in Urizen's harrowing in the Last Judgement. 17 A supreme example for this dual aspect is to be found on Plate 4 of The Book of Urizen. Urizen/Moses gave Laws of peace, of love, of unity: Of pity, compassion, forgiveness. Let each chuse one habitation: His ancient infinite mansion: One command, one joy, one desire, One curse, one weight, one measure One King, one God, one Law. In the first two lines we can find everything Blake celebrated, regulated by degenerating laws. 18 For a typical evaluation of Urizen as tyrant and oppressor, see Abrahams 14-30. Charu Sheel Shing also claims that the forces of good spring from Los and Ore, while the 153</page><page sequence="24">evil forces are typified chiefly by the fallen Urizen (138). Harold Bloom, too, tends to identify Urizen with an oppressive sky-god and fearful limiter of desire ( Blake's passim). 19 Wilkie and Johnson - dissenting somewhat from common critical consensus - explain that Urizen recognizes the threat of chaos but feels obliged to make his dismal visions come true. His "psychology is that of Jonah or any prophet of doom who ought to want to be proved wrong but in fact wants, egocentrically and irrationally, his presence to be vindicated; the result is a dynamic of self-fulfilling prediction" (55-56). 20 This idea is supported by the illustrations, too. The design for the frontispiece depicts a male nude "who resembles Blake's soaring figures, but he does not look energetic enough to have broken his bonds; if we imagine ourselves looking at him . . . from above we catch an aerial view of a sleeper lying in his unquiet bed. He is radiating light, the Divine Vision, but his eyes are closed to it" (Wilkie and Johnson 9). At the end of the ooem, however, a New Man is born, himself the Divine Vision. 21 Thomas J. Altizer in The New Apocalypse takes Hegel as a model for a theological explication of BJake, emphasizing the internalized spiritual struggle within the individual to find the divine inside. In his study he focuses primarily on Luvah. David Punter's Blake , Hegel and Dialectic , on the other hand, concentrates on the social dimension which, he claims, offers the key to the historical situation of dialectic. Lorraine Clark suggests that Blake is both Hegelian and anti-Hegelian: Briefly, my argument is that in his new focus on the struggle of Los and the Spectre in The Four Zoas, Milton and Jerusalem , Blake turns from a Hegelian 'both-and' dialectic of Ore and Urizen in his early works to something very like a Kierkegaardian 'either/or.' This new dialectic of Los and the Spectre ... is in fact a complex inversion of the Orc-Urizen dialectic. (2) For a more detailed discussion of the Hegelian/anti-Hegelian debate, see Clark 35-36. Occassionally, Hegelian terms, like "Being" and "Becoming," come up in Blake scholarship, but they are used to refer to different concepts. While Northrop Frye proposes that "Being" and "Becoming" approximate Blake's Ore and Los (247), David Bidney uses them to denote Urizen and Urthona/Los, respectively (passim). 22 For a detailed discussion of related matters see Eliade. The inevitability of agony is there in the writings of the Antinomian Abiezer Coppe, whose ideas show remarkable similarities with Blake's: But behold, behold, he is now risen with a witnesse, to save Zion with vengeance, or to confound and plague all things into himself; who by his mighty Angell is proclaiming (with a loud voyce) That Sin and Transgression is finished and ended; and everlasting righteousnesse brought in; and the everlasting Gospell preaching; Which everlasting Gospell is brought in with most terrible earth-quakes, and heaven-quakes. (qtd. in Morton 46) 154</page><page sequence="25">23 Jesus s descent and/or suffering and crucifixion in Luvah's robes of blood is unmistakably emphatic in the poem: "Eternity appeard above them as One Man infolded / In Luvah[s] robes of blood &amp; bearing all his afflictions' (Night I); "And the Divine Vision appeard in Luvahs robes of blood" (repeated twice in the next few lines in Night II); "Saviour (...) / Appearqst clothd in Luvahs garments " (already stated nine lines earlier in Night IV); "They vote the death of Luvah &amp; they naild him to the tree / They pierced him with a spear &amp; laid him in a sepulcher " (Night VII); the motif of Jesus assuming a dark Satanic body and putting it off on the cross is reiterated all through Night VIII (nine times) - The Lamb of God descended thro the twelve portions of Luvah Bearing his sorrows &amp; rec[iev]ing all his cruel wounds Thus was the Lamb of God condemnd to Death They naild him upon the tree of Mystery weeping over him And then mocking &amp; then worshipping calling him Lord &amp; King - until finally in Night IX "His crown of thorns fell from his head." The metaphor of Jesus descending in Luvah's robes of blood clearly refers to the incarnation as Christ's putting on a vegetated body; so also the emphasis on the crucifixion and the cross signify the mortal death of Jesus. Another proof for the claim that in Luvah we are presented the physical body of Christ can be found in the fact that the Zoa corresponding to him in Ezekiel is the ox or bull (we have allusions to the "bulls of Luvah" in Nights II, V, VII and IX). With the Luvah-bull association, Blake refers not so much to the strength of passions - as for this implication the other Zoa-animal, the lion, would be much more appropriate, being not only mighty but also untamed - but rather to the notion of Luvah as a sacrificial victim. 24 This notion is justified by the following lines, inserted and then deleted from Night the First (Textual Notes in Blake 825): we immortal in our own strength survive by stern debate Till we have drawn the Lamb of God into a mortal form And that he must be born is certain for One must be All And comprehend within himself all things both small &amp; great We therefore for whose sake all things aspire to be &amp; live Will so recieve the Divine Image that amongst the Reprobate He may be devoted to Destruction Urizen's positive role is even more explicitly formulated in Milton (Plate 27:55- 61): 155</page><page sequence="26">But in Eternity the Four Arts: Poetry, Painting, Music, And Architecture which is Science: are the Four Faces of Man. Not so in Time &amp; Space: there Three are shut out, and only Science remains thro Mercy: &amp; by means of Science, the Three Become apparent in Time &amp; Space, in the Three Professions Poetry in Religion: Music, Law: Painting, in Psychic &amp; Surgery: That Man may live upon Earth till the time of his awaking 25 Jorge Louis Borges also tells an enigmatic tale of Judas, who is identical with Christ (168-76). 26 This same notion is subtly implied in the heightened significance of Urizen's iron pen in Night the Sixth. The iron pen, Urizen's instrument of putting down his words of wisdom, recalls Job's lament (19:23-25): "Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book! That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock forever! For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth." It is later - in The Everlasting Gospel - given into Jesus' hands for writing the crucial sentence: "Upon his heart with Iron pen / He wrote Ye must be born again." (For a detailed discussion of the "iron pen" - including its discussion as Blake's tool of his trade - see Essick 209-37.) 27 . j'avais essaye de figurer dans mon personnage le seul christ que nous mentions" (Camus 1929). 28 Norman O. Brown identifies himself as dialectician. He uses the dialectical architectonics, which organize a process of progressive change around conflicts. Dialecticians believe that without contradiction or negation, conflict or opposition, development lacks a dynamic principle. Brown views history as a "forward-looking recherche du temps perdu" and - faithful to Hegel - sees history as the phenomenology of the mind. The dialectical/architectonic critic believes in the mind's ability to restore itself and transposes the inner struggle for self-healing to history (Pomper 132; Botond 80-86). Brown's and Blake's ideas most conspicuously overlap in the idea of endopsychic anthropomorphism. 29 For a detailed discussion of Schiller, Frye, Bloom, and Derrida in connection with apocalypse and the idea of an ahistoric aesthetic, see Goldsmith 8-19. On related matters, see Abrams 56-65. 30 In a compelling chapter - History Ends in a Book: Biblical Apocalypse and the Suppression of Difference - Steven Goldsmith meticulously points out the essential interconnectedness of "aoocalvose" and "book" (27-84). 31 W. J. Mitchell also makes mention of Urizen's association with the book, but his point of departure is substantially different: In the context of Romantic textual ideology, the book is the symbol of modern rationalistic writing and the cultural economy of mechanical reproduction, while the scroll is the emblem of ancient revealed wisdom, imagination, and the cultural economy of hand-crafted, individually 156</page><page sequence="27">expressive artifacts. . . . The book represents writing as law : it is usually associated with patriarchal figures like Urizen and Jehovah. . . . The scroll represents writing as prophecy, it is associated with youthful figures of energy, imagination, and rebellion." (137). 32 My understanding of the role attributed to eye and ear has been informed by Fabiny 39-52. WORKS CITED Abrahams, C. A. William Blake's Fourfold Man. Bonn: Bouvier 1978. Abrams, M. H.
