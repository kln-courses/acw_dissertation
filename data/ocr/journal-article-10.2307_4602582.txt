This accounts in part for the distribution of hunting populations on the peripheries of farming settlement. Contrary to the usual interpretations of Southeast Asian prehistory and of the distribution of contemporary populations, agricultural expansion may, be- cause of edge effect, support a higher density of game, and consequently may be conducive to the persistence of a hunting-gathering way of life. KEY WORDS: edge effect; hunting; protein acquisition. INTRODUCTION Until the last decade, anthropologists have examined cultures primarily as if they existed in isolation from each other, a condition which obtains only on some islands. Considerations of interactions between ethnically different populations frequently have focused on those cases which exhibit competition (Peterson, 1978: 91-94). These tendencies have produced interpretations of Southeast Asian prehistory, and the distribution of contemporary populations within Southeast Asia, which emphasize an artificial isolation of "cultures" and competitive and hierarchical relations among them (e.g., Maceda, 1964; Vanoverbergh, 1929-1930: 533; Reed, 1904). In spite of Barth's (1964: 15; 1969: 19-20) assertions that interethnic relations may assume a variety of forms, both 'University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. 1 0300-7839/81/0300-0001$03.O0 ? 1981 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">2 Peterson positive and negative, we still usually think of technologically "inferior" hunters being displaced by more "sophisticated" horticulturalists and agriculturalists. This hierarchical model assumes competition and ranking of technologies. It is analogous to the "vertical" relationships among species which Yellen (1977) notes have characterized most ecological studies. He identifies a growing tendency to examine interspecific relations "horizontally," however, focusing on their distributions in space and time and the implications of these distributions for their relationships. I will apply a "horizontal" model to understanding relations among agri- culturalists, hunters, farm clearings, wild plants, and game in Northeastern Luzon, Philippines. BACKGROUND Palanan Bay is an isolated coastal area characterized by steep river valleys and a narrow coastal plain. Typically heavy rains fall from about September through January. Two populations inhabit the area: about 10,000 farmers, predominantly Palanans, and about 800 Agta.2 During the historical period before World War II the farmers were concentrated in the lower Palanan River valley. During World War II, they began expanding up the Palanan River and up and down the coast and other rivers, leading to the present-day distribution. The majority of the area remains covered in triple canopy dipterocarp/lauan forests. Agta habitation has characteris- tically clustered on the peripheries of these farming settlements. The Agta are a hunting and fishing people, some of whom plant small swidden gardens. Agta settlement is, in part, the product of the interdependence of the two populations. Agta hunters provide fish and game to the Palanan farmers in exchange for domestically produced carbohydrate foods (predominantly corn and roots). The degree and quality of interdependence varies somewhat among different areas in Palanan as the result of environ- mental differences. For example, up the Palanan-Pinacanuan River Agta have had good access to land and produce more of their own domestic crops and receive only 70%o of their corn and roots from Palanan farmers. At the other extreme, down the coast from the Palanan River mouth Agta have little access to arable land and depend on farmers for nearly 100(10 of the carbohydrates they consume. Agta gardens on the whole are small and ill-tended, and are commonly abandoned between planting and harvest. Twelve percent of Agta did not plant in 1968-1970, and 25% planted only 2The figures are based on my own census taken in 1968-1970, and a census taken by the Philippine P'residential Arm on National Minorities (Panamin) during the same period.</page><page sequence="3">Hunting and Interethnic Relations in the Philippines 3 roots. Garden plots are typically less than 0.5 hectare (ha), sometimes only a few plants, and only 12% of the Agta plant every year. Palanan farmer dependence on Agta for wild animal protein is affected by the fact that the farmers keep few domestic animals; an average family owns four water buffalo (used only as draught animals), 30 chickens, and one pig. Domestic animals are usually butchered only on ritual occasions or when the family needs cash to meet emergency needs. For daily animal protein consumption, Palanan farmers are dependent on Agta. Conservatively, two-thirds of Palanan farmers are receiving at least 30%o, and often more than 50%o of their animal protein (by undressed weight of fish or game) from Agta. The other one-third receive substantial portions of meat and fish from Agta, depending on farmer ability and willingness to trade. Overall, for the two populations, per capita wild animal protein in- take averages 6 grams/day, as compared to 7.2 grams/capita/day of animal protein from all sources in developing nations on the whole (Agency for International Development, 1970). This represents a significant quantity of wild animal protein produced by a population of only 800 Agta, not all of whom hunt. In addition to these food exchanges, the hunters provide labor to the farmers, forest products of considerable variety, and receive clothing, cooking utensils, textiles, and tools. Farmers also are eager to acquire abandoned Agta gardens which have been cleared. The medium for most of these transactions is the ibay (special friend) relationship. Most adult Agta and Palanan men, and some women, claim ibay among the other population. Non-ibay exchanges do occur, but the ibay relationship commits both partners to frequent and regular exchanges. Furthermore, ibay may be called upon for special favors. A Palanan farmer may ask his ibay to provide game for a wedding feast, or to escort his children across the Sierra Madre to school. An Agta may seek medicine and gifts from an ibay, or ask him or her for shelter during typhoons. While the overall quality of Agta-Palanan relations is somewhat negative, ibay rela- tionships are often, in fact, close friendships. While some Palanans beat, cheat, or rape Agta, in a close ibay relationship an Agta may profoundly mourn the death of a trading partner (see Peterson, 1978a, for a fuller treatment). 3These figures are based on data collected during 1968-1970. For a more complete discussion of these exchanges see Peterson (1978a, 1978b). Such exchanges between farmers and hunters are apparently common. They are discussed, for example, by Williams (1968: 129), Sinha (1972: 386, 387), and Gardner (1972: 416, 417, 441-442, 405) for India; Lee (1972a: 331-334; 1972b: 141; 1972c: 348-349), Woodburn (1968: 50), and Turnbull (1965) for Africa; Skeat and Blagden (1906: 255), Garven (1963: 9, 32, 41, 58, 76, 80, 146, 158, 163, 261), Maceda (1964: 46-48), Vanoverbergh (1925: 431 f.n., 157), Schebesta (1952: 5711, 156 f.), Reed (1904: 44), and Fox (1956: 98) for Southeast Asia.</page><page sequence="4">4 Peterson More recent work in the area4 indicates that in addition to maintaining access to trade, Agta camp near farmers because as they expand the area under cultivation the farmers are creating on the forest-field edge and in their fields an environment which is particularly attractive to the major game animals the Agta hunt.5 Expanding cultivation enhances "edge effect," a term which describes the attraction of some animal species to the boundaries between two environmental types. Such edges, or ecotones, as they are called, are attractive to those animals which feed on items found in both component communities, or which are dependent on food in one component community and ready access to cover offered by the other. They may easily move between the two component communities and within a limited area meet their survival needs. Ecologists have long recognized the importance of ecotones in supporting higher densities of some species of game animals than does either component community by itself (Leopold, 1938: 131-132). Odum (1959: 280-281) observes that those features of edge effect which are most important to the support of game species are most pronounced in environ- ments which have been disturbed by humans. Human clearing creates the patchwork effect and broken cover which Odum (p. 281) describes as attractive to game, as well as providing access to the two flanking communities, and in the case of farming, access to the crop fields themselves. Ecotone expansion should, therefore, increase game supply (Peterson, 1977a, 1977b). That is, as the area under cultivation is expanded, the linear extent of the forest-field ecotone is increased. If indeed, the edge supports a higher density of the game Agta hunt, agricultural expansion might well compensate for concomitant forest destruction, or even lead to an increase in overall game density. Certainly it might produce high densities of game near farmers' fields, and thus attract hunters to that area.6 In Palanan, the forest-field ecotone approximately tripled between 1941 and 1968. In May, June, and July of 1978 I collected several types of data to test the hypothesis that clearing for farming enhances the existence of game upon which Agta are dependent, rather than simply destroying the forest and thereby eliminating the environment upon which both game and Agta are dependent. The 1978 study area was limited to the Dimapnat, 'I conducted this research from May through July, 1978. 5Agta also fish and hunt a variety of smaller animals including snakes, lizards, monkeys, and birds. Certainly their major hunting efforts are focused on pig and deer. They eat no domestic flesh. They hunt with bow and arrow, and since the declaration of martial law in the Philippines all use of firearms has been banned. 6Detailed accounts of hunting practices and locales are scarce. Jones (1908-1909), however, provides documentation of the Ilongot of Northern Luzon hunting successfully in and near their swidden fields.</page><page sequence="5">Hunting and Interethnic Relations in the Philippines 5 Disukad, and Dilacnadinum drainage systems, where the linear extent of the ecotone had nearly doubled in the decade since 1968. During the study period I collected data on where hunters hunted and killed game, their perceptions of game habits, actual records of game presence in the area, crop histories and crop damage histories, and plant collections to provide a vegetational description of the area. At least four times a week I traversed the extent of human habitation on the Dimapnat River valley and adjacent coastal areas, asking every hunter I could locate where he had recently hunted. By maintaining records of hunting parties and of game eaten and where it was obtained I was able to reconstruct records of where the majority of hunting was being done during that period. I also collected histories of clearing, planting, and crop damage for the same area. In addition to the quantitative data, I used a variety of techniques to elicit Agta knowledge of their environment. These included intensive inter- views about vegetational growth and game habits, plant collecting and concomitant interview, eliciting recall of memorable hunts, walking game trails with Agta and eliciting their comments on game signs and activity, asking for stories about scars acquired hunting, accompanying hunters on hunts, and on "mock" hunts where we could discuss decisions relative to various environmental conditions and game signs. PEOPLE AND PROTEIN: AGTA PERCEPTIONS While the Agta acknowledge edge effect, they also recognize an increasing scarcity of game, as well as occasional short-term shortages because of overhunting in a given locale. Clearly there is pressure on game in the Sierra Madre and the Agta correctly identify logging as a major source of that pressure. Thousands of hectares of forest on the western watershed of the Sierra Madre and north of Palanan, around Divilacan and Maconacon, have been cleared in the past 10 years. While government regulations protect growth on stream banks and residual growth, some logging companies violate these standards, bulldozing off topsoil and leaving a naked landscape. Agta comment upon new game trails high in the mountains where previously there were none and interpret these as evidence of pressure on game, which they believe is being driven to new areas. They describe their efforts to consolidiate ties with Agta from San Mariano, a former enemy territory on the western watershed of the Sierra Madre, in order, they say, to increase their hunting territory. There appears to be a conscious effort to allocate shrinking resources equitably among Agta populations. When asked if these San Mariano Agta were not experiencing even heavier pressure than Palanan Agta because of the extensive logging in</page><page sequence="6">6 Peterson the San Mariano area, Palanan Agta responded, "Yes, but they see how many people we have to feed here, and say we may sometimes hunt there." In fact, few Palanan Agta have the necessary kin ties and environmental knowledge of San Mariano to take advantage of new alliances at this time (cf. Peterson, 1980). When asked about the Karanayan-Pagsanghan area of Palanan, a traditionally friendly area for many northern coastal Palanan Agta, one man indicated that the extensive pressure and change experienced by Agta in that area as agricultural expansion now pushes them into "Ebukid"7 territory by saying, "I don't hunt there now, you find no game there, only Agta." The Karanayan-Pagsanghan area was identified by myself (1978a: 32-34) and Bennagen8 (personal communication) as the area where Agta were most attracted to practicing agriculture in 1968-1970. The implications seem to be that these Karanayan, and more recently Pagsanghan Agta who have been pushed by agricultural expansion to the boundaries of Ebukid territory, are cultivating specifically in response to environmental pressure in the form of a shrinking local supply of game. The Agta express some concern that agriculture may eventually destroy all forest to the detriment of hunting. They refer to the longer- cleared areas of Palanan as areas of poorer hunting and evidence of the negative impact of agriculture. They say, for example, "Look at Dimolit and Kapakwan [areas where clearing first occurred nearly 40 years ago, and where there is currently now new clearing]. When Lario's father was clearing there he would come to my father and say, 'we need pig for a wedding' and we would kill even five in one day. Now we cannot kill so many there. Now we must hunt far up Dimapnat or Dilacnadinum." Such assertions illustrate long-term Agta movement relative to the ecotone and emphasize the significance of ongoing clearing. During the period of initial clearing, when Lario's fatehr was clearing in Dimolit and on the lower Dimapnat, the hunting was "good;" once an area is permanently settled and clearing stops, as in Dimolit, or less clearing is being done as in the lower Dimapnat, the hunting is not "good." In support of this interpretation, Agta acknowledge edge effect, and when asked to provide a history of hunting in the area, they exhibit an explicit preference for hunting in newly cleared areas. This history was "'Ebukid" is a term, meaning literally "of the mountain," applied by Palanan Agta to inland and northern coastal Agta. It is often translated "wild Agta" by English-speak- ing residents of Palanan. Ebukid are said never to plant or trade, but P. Bion Griffin of the University of Hawaii, who has conducted research among Ebukid Agta, indi- cates that virtually all of them plant and trade. Palanan Agta attribute superior hunting skill to Ebukid. The Ebukid hunters referred to were born and reared in areas beyond Palanan, and married Palanan Agta women. 'Ponciano Bennagen, University of the Philippines, has carried out several studies of Palanan Agta since 1968.</page><page sequence="7">Hunting and Interethnic Relations in the Philippines 7 elicited by asking them where the best hunting was when they were boys first learning to hunt, when they were first married, when their own children were young, and now. The progression of "best hunting sites" over four decades exactly replicates the pattern of new clearing in the Palanan area. In the longer cleared areas, those cleared earliest, farmers still report 10 to 2007 crop losses to game, in spite of their efforts to minimize the damage, indicating a significant game presence in those areas. On the Dimapnat, much of which has been cleared for 20 years, 28 pig kills and nine deer kills were reported in 9 months of 1978.9 In spite of this continued game presence, Agta perceptions are that optimum hunting prevails as the forest-field ecotone is created and expanded. Their evaluation of "good" hunting site and actual kill and crop damage figures suggests that the Agta may be a population specifically dependent on ecotone expansion as opposed to ecotone maintenance, or at least opportunistic in their exploitation of it. According to Agta accounts, game appears to be attracted particularly to newly cleared areas, they persist in long-cleared areas as long as some forest remains nearby, and this attraction shows a marked seasonal pattern. 'The Agta recognize five environmental types which are relevant to their discussions of game habits and hunting activities. They are: 1. dinum: water, referring to any body of water; 2. baybay: land beside water, whether a beach or river bank; 3. sikau: any cleared area; a crop field, road, trail, or grassland; 4. katalonan: dipterocarp/lauan forest; 5. pagabat: (or bahikatkat, a dialect difference): fruit forest.10 9I arrived in Palanan on May 1, and data for April are based on hunter recall. All kill data were collected and cross-checked by asking each hunter, at least once a week, where he last killed game, who his hunting companions were, where and with whom he was camped, the species, sex, and approximate age of the animal, and the type of environment in which it was sighted and killed. An additional cross-check involved asking hunters and others when they last ate meat, from whom they acquried it, and where it was killed. Whenever possible, I examined kills myself to ascertain species, sex, approximate age, and the condition of the animal (especially thickness of the subcutaneous fatty tissue and, for females, whether or not they were lactating). Cross-checking eliminated multiple reports of the same animal and verified actual kills, but some kills may not have been reported. Kill sites were inspected whenever that was practical in order to pinpoint location. Other kill sites were identified on maps and coordinated with topographic features such as mountain crests, stream conforma- tions, and specific fields. "I was not able to elicit a generic term for secondary growth. A secondary growth area last planted 15 years ago, but clearly different from primary forest in the amount of ground cover, and in species representation, was called katalonan. Other secondary growth area cleared two to four years ago and allowed to regenerate were called sikau. While I have not probed this matter using sophisticated linguistic techniques, I would venture that once sizable dipterocarps are evident, sikau becomes katalonan. On the whole, secondary growth is relatively rare in Palanan; Palanan farmers take over abandoned Agta clearings, and many Palanan fields are permanently cultivated (see Peterson, in press-b).</page><page sequence="8">8 Peterson They also distinguish steep slopes and ridges (bukid) from flatter land. They identify ecotones as digdig (edges), and recognize their function in game behavior. According to the Agta, the preferred foods of wild pigs are fruit, domestic or wild, followed closely by domestic field crops such as rice, corn, and a variety of roots and tubers, especially yams and manioc. They also feed on wild roots and worms. The degree of concentration of pig in any area is apparently a factor of selection of feeding sites. The three types of sites identified by the Agta as offering the highest concentrations of food are forest "at the edge of the mountain" (katalonan digdig ni bukid), eco- tones of forest and any clearing (katalonan at sikau), and cultivated fields. The so called "mountain edge" offers a concentration of forest fruits as a result of topography. In the Palanan Bay watershed, valley profiles are characterized by a relatively level flood plain, supplanted by the lowest terrace with a gradual slope, then a steep slope of 50 to 90Wo. Fruits borne on the steeper slopes roll to the bases of those slopes and are concentrated in the area identified as A in Fig. 1. This is the area the Agta call the "edge of the mountain." Typically, the lowest terrace of the river is cleared and cultivated; in some areas of Palanan, clearing is now occurring on higher terraces as well. This produces a forest-field ecotone, typically at point B in Fig. 1. The concentration of forest fruits on this ecotone results, according to Agta, from the fact that most forest fruit-bearing plants are light-seekers which grow in profusion on such edges, as opposed to deep forest where there is too little light in most places to support a high density of such plants. B A DOMESTIC FOREST C ROPS DI MAPNAT RIVER 30 m Fig. 1. Profile of Dimapnat River valley.</page><page sequence="9">Hunting and Interethnic Relations in the Philippines 9 Cultivated fields obviously support a high density of food plants, and according to Agta, also support a higher density of worms, probably because the soils are regularly disturbed and loosened. Seasonal patterns show a concentration of pig near the forest-field ecotone from March through July (essentially the dry season), and a more dispersed pattern, some remaining near the forest-field ecotone, and some concentrating in pagatbat, August through February. During October, November, and December forest fruits bear most heavily and are most heavily concentrated in pagatbat. Within these seasonal patterns pig move daily, often exhibiting high mobility, on other occasions remaining days at a time in one area. Pigs mate in November and December, bear young in March or April, and nurse them at least through May or June. This is relevant to the process of ecotone attraction discussed below. Deer feed on leaves and, to a lesser extent, fruits. Of domestic crops they feed on rice, corn leaves, and young ears of corn. They are attracted to stream-forest ecotones to the extent that some popular food plants are light- dependent, but they generally range more through the forest than do pigs. Their more limited attraction to crop fields and lesser dependence on seasonally available forest fruits are reflected in a less marked seasonal pattern. Deer mate year round, and, unlike pigs, do not herd. PIGS AND PLANTS Kill Counts As I have indicated, in addition to material on Agta knowledge and perceptions of their environment, I took quantitative measures of game and hunting. Data collected on kills in the Dimapnat, Disukad, and Dilacnadinum drainage systems for the months of April through July 1978 confirm Agta statements of game behavior, indicating that Agta are killing significant quantities of pigs and deer in close proximity to a forest-field ecotone, even in long-cleared area. These data are summarized in Table I. Arranged by area, these data show significant variation, explained in part by vegetational differences between the two areas (Dimapnat as opposed to Disukad/Dilacnadinum). The lower reaches of the Dimapnat drainage system were first cleared by Agta in the 1930s. Until the 1950s, however, they had no saws and only saplings of 10 to 20 cm diameter or less were cut to provide cleared areas for campsites or tiny gardens.'" In the "Archaeological excavation conducted by W. Peterson (Ms. in preparation) of a swidden floor on the Dimapnat confirms Agta and Palanan recall of these clearing practices. The ex- cavated swidden debris consisted of saplings of 5 to 10 cm diameter.</page><page sequence="10">10 Peterson Table I.

There are also tiny scattered clearings upriver to the second tributary. By contrast, the only permanent fields on the Disukad or Dilacnadinum were opened in the 1970s and are at the mouths of those rivers. There are small scattered clearings upstream on both rivers. The Dimapnat may be described as an area of both more extensive and more intensive clearing than the Disukad/Dilacnadinum areas. In areas of intensive clearning, Agta hunt predominantly in farmers' fields, or very near the forest-field ecotone. On the average, for all areas, about half of all pig and a third of all deer are killed near the edge. Other factors having to do with the nature and intensity of hunting in the two areas and seasonal variation in hunting patterns are also relevant. The period of the field study is that period of the year when minimal rain allows Agta to range widely; kills for the Dimapnat area, as opposed to the other two drainage systems, can be expected to run higher during the rainy season when Agta are clustered in that area. Even during the dry season Agta exhibit a significant degree of hunting success near the forest-field ecotone. This does not establish that game exist in greater numbers in that area during the same period. Other data, however, suggest that pig, at least, do concentrate near the edge. These data have to do with the described distribution of wild fruit-bearing plants relative to human activity, and again they confirm Agta perceptions of their environment. Wild Plants Plants were sampled in three different settings, using point quarter sampling on a line transect incorporating both the forested and unforested components of the ecotone. These three settings were (1) a corn/rice field 15 meters (m) above sea level on the second terrace of the Dimapnat River, cleared in the 1950s, continuously cultivated since then, adjacent to a triple</page><page sequence="11">Hunting and Interethnic Relations in the Philippines 11 canopy (dipterocarp/lauan) forested tract on the first river terrace; (2) a stream bed (the Calumagan, a tributary of the Dimapnat) at 85 m above sea level, adjacent to a triple canopy forest; and (3) a secondary growth area, cleared in 1972 and 1973, but never cultivated, on the lowest terrace of the Dimapnat (20 m above sea level), adjacent to triple canopy forest. In the first setting, plants upon which pig feed were found to prevail at the forest edge.'2 Plants upon which deer feed were found predominantly in the second and third settings. Throughout the Dimapnat area wild bananas cluster at the edges of fields cleared and cultivated for 5 or more years. Areas once cleared, never cultivated, or briefly cultivated and allowed to revert to secondary growth are characterized by dense cover and vegetation dominated by wild bananas or guavas. More recently cleared areas on the lower Dimapnat, farmed by Ilocano farmers who have immigrated to Palanan within the last decade, are cleared regularly; these Ilocano farmers continually push back the forest and clear new growth so that regeneration is curtailed (W. Peterson, in press; J. Peterson, 1980). The Agta volunteered that many of the plants pigs feed on grow at the edges of clearings, that is, along trails and roads, the edges of "natural" grasslands, and beside farmers' fields. This occurs, as mentioned above, because these plants require more light than exists in most of the forest itself. Pagatbat, the lower growth on the ridges of some mountains, does not obscure light and permits growth of these species. They specifically identified six species of animal plant foods as edge species, three which prefer secondary growth, and 10 which grow equally well in primary forest or on edges of clearings. They also identified 12 pagatbat species upon which pigs feed. One of these was included in my edge samples, which in- cluded 12 identified pig plant foods, and 10 deer plant foods. They identified 16 species which grow in katalonan, two of which were included in my edge samples. They also identified five pagatbat species upon which deer feed (none of which appeared in my samples), and 12 katalonan species (three of which were included in my samples). Both Agta perceptions of their environment and the floral descriptions derived from plant collections suggest that human clearing creates the biotope for many of the plants upon which pig, and to an extent deer, feed. '2Scientific taxonomic identification of these specimens is being conducted by botanists at the National Museum of the Philippines and the University of the Philippines. This analysis of plant distributions is based on native terms. Identification of plant collections I made in 1968-1970 indicated that Agta use several terms for grasses in different growth stages; this was not true, however, of forest fruit-bearing species of the sort considered here.</page><page sequence="12">12 Peterson Domestic Crops and Crop Damage I collected crop histories and crop damage histories from every farmer (a total of 37) on the Dimapnat River and adjacent coastal area.13 Game damage to crops typically results from pig or deer eating all or part of the plant, or pigs rooting or trampling plants. Larger percentages of crops are destroyed during the initial periods of clearing. Palanan farmers characteristically open new fields piecemeal, that is, they gradually clear underbrush and smaller trees, aiming to plant some crop (typically yams, manioc, or sugarcane) during the first year in order to make a legal claim to the land as an agriculturally improved property. In the next year, a farmer may plant some corn in areas sufficiently cleared to allow plow access; on the whole, however, in anticipation of excessive loss they prefer to plant less labor-intensive crops. Over a period of 3 or more years, they will have cleared all trees from about 1 hectare of land, and will begin to plow that land and plant corn and rice. Until this time, and perhaps even longer, they will maintain a house and fields elsewhere. Within 3 to 5 years the farmer will move to the new fields, turning old fields over to siblings, children, or tenants, possibly selling that land, or sometimes allowing it to revert to secondary growth. Even once fields are plowed a farmer may continue to push into the forest, clearing some land each year, planting it initially to pineapple or roots, and eventually to corn or rice. During the initial years of clearing farmers report a loss of 80 to 100% of their potential yield to game. Once all trees are removed, the land plowed, and residence is established in the midst of those fields, or the fields are visited daily by humans, crop losses to game drop to 40 or 50%7o. Once plowing their land, farmers take often extraordinary measures to protect their crops. Many fence their fields, others devise anthropomorphic figures or noisemakers to frighten game. Some place traps at every game trail entering their fields, and a few place guards in the fields every night. In a '3Crop histories and crop damage histories were collected by asking each farmer when clearing was initiated and completed on his land, what percentage of the crop he lost during initial clearing and when clearing was completed, the crops and losses during the best and worst years for crop loss, the crops and their locations during these various periods, pro- tection measures he used, and the history of human habitation. Complete planting and loss data were collected for the three previous years (1976-1978). While these data necessarily represent farmers' estimates, patterns of crop loss clearly emerged, and discrepant data, were easily identified and double-checked. Where two generations had farmed the land, all living parties were interviewed. Farmers computed crop loss in two ways. When losses were total, approached lOWo, or were nearly total in some limited area of a field, crop loss was computed in terms of the percentage of hectarage destroyed. Otherwise, they com- puted crop loss by comparing actual yields for a given year with average yields over a period of time. Crop damage as computed here does not include yield lost to insects, rats, or weather.</page><page sequence="13">Hunting and Interethnic Relations in the Philippines 13 stabilized area, one in which there is no new clearing and fields are some- how protected, farmers lose only 10 to 15 % of their crop annually to game. Any adjacent new clearing sends losses back up to 50 to 800%. Corner fields, those with two sides exposed to the forest, suffer significantly higher losses. Conversely, buffered fields, those completely surrounded by cultivation, show significantly lower losses. These results suggest several attributes of game feeding habits. Game are attracted to crop fields, but especially to crop field expansion, the period when the edge is ragged and growing. This is evidenced by the lowered crop damage once an area is stabilized, and by crop damage increases with any adjacent new clearing. The variation in crop damage among corner fields, one-side-forested fields, and buffered fields suggests that game animals prefer edges of fields near the forest, perhaps because such edges provide ready access to cover. Dense human habitation, while important, is less a deterrent to game than daily human presence in the fields. Most important, game continue to feed in crop fields in spite of stabilization, human presence, and quite remarkable efforts by farmers to keep them out. Several characteristics of the forest-field ecotone appear to be involved in game attraction. These are the field crops, broken cover, and the abundance of forest fruits on the edge. On the basis of data on wild plant distributions, domestic crop damage, and game habits, I would project both annual and long-term patterns of game movement and Agta hunting. Pigs exhibit a seasonal pattern. Forest fruits, as noted, bear predominantly in August through February, and are nearly barren March through July. Pigs bear young in March and nurse litters April and May (some as late as July). The lean period in the forest, therefore, coincides with a period of heavy nutritional demand and vulnerability for pigs. In March and April they feed on domestic rice, and in May, June, and July on corn. During these months they are concentrated on the ecotone, and are more evenly dispersed the remainder of the year. This presents a strong case for clearing and cultivation supporting a higher pig population, in exchange for about a 10% crop loss'4 once an area has stabilized. Pigs, an opportunistic species, bear large litters, many of which would perish under normal forest conditions. With an expanding edge, however, and adjacent '4In terms of exchange rates based on my 1968-1970 data, a 10% crop loss is cheap for the quantity of animal protein produced. Using those 1968-1970 data on Palanan corn pro- duction and Agta pig and deer production for the northern area studied in 1978, I find that Agta pig and deer production is worth about five times as much as 10% of the corn crop. While this is an approximate statement of the relative value of field crops and wild animal protein in the estimates of Palanan and Agta, it certainly indicates that some crop loss is worthwhile to support game.</page><page sequence="14">14 Peterson crop fields, a higher percentage of individuals in a litter will survive. Under conditions of forest disturbance by agriculture, pigs thrive. Lower game yields to Agta hunters during the period of pig concentration on ecotones (Peterson, 1978a: 35-36) is the product of their reduced incentive to hunt: the game are lean, fishing is good, field crops are abundant, and farmers are eager to hire Agta to harvest, paying them in crops or cash. This reduced hunting activity in itself probably spares some females, thereby assuring that more sucklings will reach maturity. Further- more, during this period Agta are scattered, taking advantage of the good weather to spend as much time as possible in their favored upriver sites far from the social influence and scrutiny of the often condescending and critical farmers. Even during this period, most of them kill a majority of game near the edge. The Agta begin to cluster near farmers and the ecotone, as swollen streams limit their mobility and access to trade for weeks at a time, beginning in late September. During October, November, and December when pigs are feeding on forest fruits, they range as far in their hunting as flooding allows them. They identify as the best hunting time, seasonally, that period when both Agta and game are concentrated near the ecotone-March and April. In May, the Agta begin to disperse, the game remain concentrated, and the Agta, although campsites are more scattered, continue to hunt with significant success on the ecotone. The seasonal pat- tern of deer is less pronounced than that of pig. They are attracted to crop fields May through June, while rice is up or corn is green, but they are more timid around humans. During the rainy season they are attracted to the heavily bearing pagatbat forest. Throughout the year, these more solitary animals remain more evenly dispersed through the forest than do pig. Agta acknowledge that they could kill more deer, but choose not to because they are leaner and do not herd. The long-range pattern of clearing, game movement, and Agta migra- tion is also revealing. It appears that Agta remain just on the edge of, and slightly ahead of, the expansion of farming settlement. These are the areas they also identify as the ideal hunting areas. It seems reasonable to suggest that the Agta are a population of hunters specifically adapted to conditions of clearing and agricultural expansion, identifying as really good hunting only those conditions in which game are initially heavily attracted to an expanding ecotone. IMPLICATIONS: PEOPLE, PLANTS, AND PROTEIN Previously I explored the direct impact of Agta and Palanans on each other through the exchange of wild animal protein for carbohydrates</page><page sequence="15">Hunting and Interethnic Relations in the Philippines 15 (Peterson, 1978a, 1978b). I had also observed that Agta, through the creation of little gardens on the peripheries of an expanding farming settlement, created a ready niche into which Palanans could easily move: when Palanans take over Agta swidden plots the majority of clearing has been completed, tree stumps are rotting out, and some permanent crops may be planted. This represents the indirect impact of Agta activity on Palanans; the Agta, by modifying the natural environment for their own ends, develop an environment which is optimal for the expansion of permanent fields by farmers. The data presented in this paper suggest that Palanans have a similar indirect effect on Agta: through the continued expansion of the ecotone and development of permanent crop fields for their own ends, they create and maintain an environment which is optimal for the game upon which the Agta are dependent. Both Agta and Palanans, through their respective subsistence activities and trade, benefit from both the increased domestic carbohydrate production and the enhanced game supply. In that sense, plant and animal species thrive, as well, because of, rather than in spite of human activity. While Agta prey on game, and both Agta and Palanans compete with game for plant foods, both human popu- lations actively create an environment supportive of higher game populations. This expanded interpretation may be incorporated into models developed by W. Peterson and myself (W. Peterson, in press; J. Peterson, 1977a; Peterson and Peterson, 1977) as shown in Fig. 2. This interpretation has implications for prehistory, history, and contemporary world food problems. A survey of the historical literature offers numerous references to the abundance of game at the time of Spanish contact and under initial Spanish rule (Blair and Robertson, 1903-1909, Vol. 6: 204-205, Vol. 18: 98-99, Vol. 21: 197, Vol. 29: 46-47, Vol. 37: 295). Furthermore, we have historical evidence that the Spanish colonial regime took a heavy toll on game populations and their forest environment. The Spanish collected tribute in timber and hides (Blair and Robertson, 1903-1909, Vol. 18: 98-99, Vol. 47: 292, Vol. 12: 188). Tens of thousands of deer hides were exported annually to Japan and India. Furthermore, the Spanish in the Philippines utilized game as food supply, and one source suggested using the abundant game of those islands as the food supply base of expeditions to China (Blair and Robertson, 1903-1909, Vol. 6: 204-205). Finally, the smallpox epidemic of 1685 took a heavy toll on game as well as human populations (Blair and Robertson, 1903-1909, Vol. 42: 234). In addition to the assault on game, the Spanish devasted large forested areas. Virtually all of the vast fleet of Spanish galleons, the largest ships of their time, were constructed and repaired in the Philippines, utilizing the excellent qualities of tropical hardwoods to produce their renowned merchant fleet (Schurz, 1959).</page><page sequence="16">16 Peterson | PALANAN lAGTA PROTE IN SUPPLY CARBOHYDRATE HUNTIG S SSUPPLY I + j I + t AGTA -Ill llPALANAN |PROTEIN SUPPLY | rAE/CARBOHYDRATE AGTA m s PALANANd n |HUNTING SUCCESS ||CROP PRODUCION GAME SUPPLY PRODUCT IV IT Y+ OF WILD FRUIT BI OTOPE LINEAR EXTENT _+ OF ECOTONE |EXPANDED + + 1 ~~~FARM CLEARINGS_ OUTWAR MOVEMENT | NEW SWIDDENS| Fig. 2. Model interpreting relationships among people, plants, and protein. The historical material suggests that colonial activity, not indigenous farming, produced the displacement of hunting and swidden populations that we observe today. Certainly, agriculture ultimately took its toll, but not necessarily indigenous agriculture. Constantino (1975: 119, 137-138) analyzes the impact of plantation agriculture on land use. Plantation agriculture displaced farmers, often directly affected forest destruction, and required opening new lands in forested areas to meet local food needs. The annual United States Bureau of Forestry Reports (1907-1935) document the degree and pattern of forest destruction in the Phillipines under an American forestry policy difficult to enforce (e.g., Bureau of Forestry Report, 1908: 15-16; 1928: 8). Furthermore, by 1910 (pp. 8-9) reports distinguish the role of indigenous swidden horticulture from forest clearing for acquisition of land holdings by absentee landlords. Apparently the</page><page sequence="17">Hunting and Interethnic Relations in the Philippines 17 plantation system and absentee landlord holdings, particularly as they involved production of nonfood cash crops such as tobacco and abaca, were responsible for extensive forest destruction. All clearing of this sort has occurred within the last century to century and a half, and was directly or indirectly the result of colonial activity and world trade. Consideration, then, of the actual role of indigenous farming suggests an alternative interpretation of prehistory. Rather than destroying the forest environment to the detriment of game and hunters (see, e.g., Blair and Robertson, 1903-1909, Vol. 43: 114; Reed, 1904: 14; Beyer et al., 1926: 8; Cole, 1945: 5; Kroeber, 1919: 18; Spencer, 1954: 4), indigenous farming may have created the environment which enhanced game supply; at the same time, hunting provided a check on expanding game populations resulting from the expansion of the edge. It is possible that the earliest clearing and cultivation achieved these ends, further enhanced by the possibility of trade among ethnically and technologically diverse popu- lations. Linares (1976) provides evidence of what she calls "garden hunting," or ecotone exploitation in a New World tropical setting between A.D. 960 and A.D. 985. Similar settlements are represented in Panama from 3000 B.C. on (p. 332). The combination of swidden gardens and hunting may have produced a "cultural biomass" (p. 342), that is, disturbance by horticulture produced increased carbohydrate and wild animal biomass within a limited area, conditions which might substitute for animal domestication (p. 348). Certainly, these ethnographic and archaeological data suggest new interpretations for Southeast Asian prehistory, and indicate directions of inquiry for other areas of prehistory. Theoretically, the interpretation offered here is significant in that the relationships described must be characterized as horizontal in the sense that one party is not simply feeding off or exploiting the other. They are, moreover, complex relationships which exhibit both positive and negative valence. Lest this picture of ethnic relationships become too idyllic, let me note that this system, which could have been operating for millenia, can change, indeed is probably changing now. Dwyer (1978), in a study of rats in areas of New Guinea disturbed by humans and their pigs, demonstrated that higher densities of some rat species are supported in areas of human disturbance. Human disturbance of the forest, however, ultimately produces a reduction and eventual elimination of the forest and the disturbed forest edges where rats thrive. Similarly, continued forest destruction in the Philippines, whether by farmers or loggers, will reduce the ratio of edge to cleared area, thus increasing crop fields at the expense of game habitats. To illustrate this, compare the present ecotone pattern in the northern Palanan area with its potential pattern (Figs. 3 and 4). In fact, the rather rugged topography of this particular area of Palanan will probably limit such extensive expansion of clearing for farms</page><page sequence="18">18 Peterson tN\ t PALANAN BAY erests Forest XX 10 Forest Forest CLEARED AREA I . I 1 km Fig. 3. Present ecotone pattern in Dimapnat watershed. given the present farming technology. It will not, however, limit clearing by loggers. Certainly, areas like the Cagayan Valley, which are topographically well suited to peasant farming technology, and where living residents recall stands of forest in areas which are now corn fields and grasslands, have probably experienced breakdown of such a system through farming and logging enterprises. Furthermore, an influx of llocano farmers is creating other changes which can be expected radically to modify the existing system in Palanan (W. Peterson, 1980; J. Peterson, 1980). There should be, however, no reason why areas like Palanan cannot be maintained to provide an optimal balance of farming, hunting, and logging through management</page><page sequence="19">Hunting and Interethnic Relations in the Philippines 19 X..... . ....

CLEARED Fig. 6. Poorly planned clearing. of edges as opposed to management of land areas. Geometrically this means simply clearing in patterns such as the one in Fig. 5, as opposed to that in Fig. 6, in order to maintain a high ratio of edge to clearing. This would provide the maximum biotope for the wild fruits upon which game feed. Ratio and placement of crop fields to forest could also be managed to provide game access to domestic crops at minimal cost in crop loss. Adequate baseline ecological studies of humans, game, and plants should produce models which suggest the means of continuing valuable horizontal relationships which have persisted from prehistoric time well into the 20th century. Failure to acheive this degree of planning and management could have far-reaching deleterious effects on human food supply in such developing areas. Among other changes, I would predict a move from positive valence relations to negative valence relations among human populations. While simple competition, which might occur, for example, over land if Agta are forced to a dependence on farming, is a horizontal relationship, it is conceivable that vertical relationships could develop in which Agta are grossly exploited for their resources and labor (cf. Peterson, 1978a: 91-93; see, e.g., Despres, 1975: 194, 198-199, 201; Hoetink, 1975: 10-1 1). Conclusive statements on the relations among Agta, Palanans, game, and plants will require the collaboration of plant, animal, and human ecologists over an annual cycle. The data presented here are, however, very suggestive. Far from achieving environmental destruction, farming expansion in Palanan appears to be supporting a high density of game. Domestic crop fields, the forest edge biotope, and broken cover-all the creations of humans-are important in this respect. Agta can hunt and trade in close proximity to farmers. By doing so they also provide a check on game which would take an even heavier toll without Agta hunting. Through trade the two human populations feed each other, and both are therefore clependent on game and expanded crop fields for food. These relationships are neither simple, nor simply competitive; they are clearly complex and horizontal.</page><page sequence="21">Hunting and Interethnic Relations in the Philippines 21 REFERENCES Agency for International Development (1970).
