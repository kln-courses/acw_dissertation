Gaswork (Figs 1&amp;2)', an unexpectedly human-scale installation commissioned by Bord Gais from the Belfast-born, London-based artist John Kindness was officially 'unveiled' on a strip of cobbles beside the Liffey, once the main artery of the city. Measuring 6x4 metres and 2.5 metres, its elliptical drum form evokes the mighty, now-obsolete gasometers which once borded its site. These provided Dubliners with gas from coal before the advent of North Sea gas and the transformation of an extensive hard-working community into leisure-bent, speculative property development. Its colourful vitreous enamel surface fired on steel, well known in other forms to admirers of Kindness' many public and private artworks in Belfast (Royal Victoria on Dublin's Sir John to recall the history of gas Children's Hospital entrance sign,1998) and Dublin (his Teething Troubles in an Energy Efficient Restaurant, Crow Street ESB sub-sta tion gates, Temple Bar, 1995), recalls the industrial nature of a commission aimed to commemorate the history of gas in Ireland and 'those thousands of workers and customers who have Kindness believes his proposal was successful because it avoids nostalgia and history lessons. Instead, it considers the industry as a 'composite portrait of a 20th- century pre-digital society built from observations, anecdotes and personal memories'2 as widespread gas distribution heralded modernization and the end of the Ireland of De Valera (represented by traditional ingredients and anthropomorphic gas-cooked and simultaneously gas-lit dishes). Like his other public, site-specific works, such HE IS ATTRACTED BY FRIEZES AS NARRATIVE PRECURSORS OF THE COMIC STRIP, LONG VALUED AS WORDLESS TRANSMITTERS OF VISUAL IMAGERY been part of the Dublin gas story'. Bord Gais not only wanted to mark the completion of its gas mains renewals programme, but to provide a visual record of 'the former presence of their works in what is now Dublin's docklands', to mark the 'almost total disappearance of the gas industry that used to occupy most of the land.' as the now iconic 10-metre-long, blue and white tile-clad Big Fish (1999) installed beside Belfast's revived river Lagan, 'Gaswork' offers a wealth of unexpected visual puns and surprising conflations. Always interested in applying age-old technical processes to his witty, idiosyncratic adaptations of popular culture, Kindness has enjoyed 60 IRISH ARTS REVIEW I AUTUMN 2012 Gaswork Nicola Gordon Bowe</page><page sequence="2">1&amp;2JOHN KINDNESS b.1951 GASWORK 2012 Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin masquerading as a ham on a plate, followed by two men bearing a cab bage and a wild hare for the pot. The joys of gas-heated hot water are por trayed by a naked towelled and tur banned woman, while U2's Adam Clayton languidly sponges an arm, poised like his namesake in Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel fresco - but here in an old-fashioned bathtub from which steam rises in the shape of Ireland and the rest of Europe. The morphing borders which often adorn Kindness' paintings are here gas flames running uniformly along a terracotta-coloured rim (like Greek pottery decoration) above the indigo blue backgrounds of each frieze. To these colours, taken directly from the triple-layered processional friezes of the 2600 BC double-sided Sumerian 'Standard of Ur' (British Museum), Kindness has added a flat palette of cream, flesh-pink, black, pale blue and grey. The customs, superstitions and dangers associated with coal, its transport and labour illustrated in the lower frieze are drawn from the accounts of the many people who spent their lives working in the industry. We see coal bags made of naked miners' backs hunched on a horse-pulled cart; coal-black faces upturned in loaded trucks; a coal steamship risking war-time German shells; children with whooping cough being held over a tar pit by their par ents to cure them; injured men clock ing in, then taking refuge to 'work' in the Store Room to avoid losing pay. Overalled scientists bear corroded, menacing-looking old cast-iron pipes for analysis, while a fellow office worker charts their replacement strat egy. Behind them men undertake the perilous, back-breaking work of drilling and digging out hazardous gas filtration beds with picks and shovels. The more you look, the more you see. Once again, with striking imagery and perfectly matched technique, John Kindness has synthesized ancient and modern, local history and memory, in a readily accessible yet highly original record of a changed world. ■ Nicola Gordon Bowe is Associate Fellow, Faculty of Visual Culture, NCAD and Visiting Professor, School of Art &amp; Design, University of Ulster.

He is attracted by friezes as narrative precursors of the comic strip, long val ued as wordless transmitters of visual imagery, as in his Belfast Frescoes (1994, Ulster Museum) which record his childhood in a series of twenty beguilingly observed frames, impecca bly painted in lime fresco onto small pieces of slate. That mid 20th-century vanished world he grew up in reap pears in the upper frieze. Here, three children poke a gas meter to release coins, flanked by the hen and chicks and sow and bonhams that used to grace the pennies they needed to buy the nostalgic array of sweets above them. More images of the beguiling old Irish animal coinage appear on the gasman's van beside their friend's father and his shaggy dog, poised before a pint with meter money he'd substituted with lino-cut discs, and beside mother with her bizarre apron depicting her diet of cabbages and bacon and the foetus in her womb.
