<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Notes Hellenistic Philosophy and Some Science KEIMPE ALGRA These book notes mainly deal with some recent books on Hellenistic philos- ophy, but the final section will be devoted to three books on ancient science (post-Hellenistic as well as Hellenistic). Let us begin with Hellenistic scepti- cism. Its students are well served by three recent books (one edition and two monographs) published by Oxford University Press. Aristocles of Messene is one of the most important sources for our knowledge of (or perhaps better: for our ideas about) Pyrrho and early Pyrrhonism, since he reported a sum- mary of an account of Pyrrho's central ideas by his 'pupil' Timon, a report which has been preserved for us by Eusebius. The other fragments (all, as it happens, preserved by Eusebius) also offer interesting critical accounts of other schools. We now have a new edition, with English translation and exten- sive commentary, of the fragments and testimonia of this Aristocles, prepared by Maria Lorenza Chiesara, which supersedes the earlier editions of Mullach (1881) and Heiland (1925).' In her introduction C. depicts Aristocles as an acute and faithful representative of the Aristotelianism of the first century AD (although his date can still not be established with certainty). She rejects the idea of a specific debt, on Aristocles' part, to either Antiochus of Ascalon or Middle Platonism, while acknowledging that Aristocles seems to have shared the idea of a philosophical continuity between Plato and Aristotle, and that it may be significant that Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics were lumped together in book 7 of his On Philosophy, whereas the schools to be rejected (Pyrrhoneans, Cyrenaics, Metrodorus, Protagoreans, Eleatics and Epicureans) were discussed in book 8. She also discusses such meagre indications as there are of the original structure of the ten books of Aristocles' On Philosophy, and offers a plausible reconstruction of the sequence of the available frag- ments from book 8 (showing, on the basis of the introductions and connect- ing texts, that the original sequence in Aristocles was not the same as the sequence in Eusebius - hence the numbering of the fragments in this edition ' Aristocles of Messene; Testimonia and Fragments, Edited with Translation and Commentary by Maria Lorenza Chiesara, Oxford Classical Monographs Series, Oxford (Oxford University Press) 2001; xlii + 218 pp.; ISBN 0-19-924154-6; price not indicated.

The material is not extensive: 6 tes- timonies, from the Suda, Asclepius and Philoponus; and 8 fragments proper, all from Eusebius. Yet the interpretation, especially, of the famous fragment on Pyrrho (fr. 4 in this edition) is not easy. Not surprisingly its discussion takes up about half of the commentary. We are offered a cautious line-by-line commentary, charting the philosophical and philological problems and offer- ing well-balanced assessments of the positions that have been taken by other scholars thus far (not much that is new, though). One of C.'s conclusions is that Aenesidemus, or an epitomator close to him, was Aristocles' source for most of the chapter on Pyrrhonism, including the part on Pyrrho's and Timon's kephalaia (in which case what we have is Eusebius reporting Aristocles reporting Aenesidemus reporting Timon reporting Pyrrho). I am not in a position to assess the quality of the edition as such, but the commentary in itself will prove to be a useful tool for students of Hellenistic philosophy in general, and of Pyrrhonism in particular. Next, we have Richard Bett's Pyrrho, his Antecedents, and his Legacy.2 As the title already indicates, the book is an attempt to study Pyrrho not, or not only, in his own right, but in the context of both the earlier thinkers from whom he may have taken inspiration and the later philosophers who adopted him as a figurehead. Indeed, B. claims that his reconstruction of Pyrrho's phi- losophy is more probable than others, not only insofar as it makes better sense of the evidence on Pyrrho himself, but also insofar as it is more succesful in accounting for Pyrrho's position in the history of philosophy. Hence the parts of the book that deal with pre-Pyrrhonean and post-Pyrrhonean developments are integral to the main project of making sense of the evidence on Pyrrho, a project which B. calls an 'excercise in reflective equilibrium' (p. 13). B. opts for a non-epistemological, 'metaphysical' interpretation of Pyrrho's original position: Pyrrho's primary claim was that reality is inherently indeterminate (the 'indeterminacy thesis'). This means that according to Sextus' standards Pyrrho would qualify as a 'negative dogmatist' rather than as a sceptic. This is not in itself new: comparable reconstructions have been offered by Decleva Caizzi and Hankinson (and, cautiously, by Chiesara in the book referred to above), and in the first chapter of Long and Sedley 's The Hellenistic Philosopher-s. But, as said above, B. attempts to strengthen this case by taking a fresh approach to the question of Pyrrho's sources (ch. 3, 'Looking Backwards') and to the question of what happened between Pyrrho and Sextus (ch. 4, 'Looking Forwards'). As for the former question, he maintains that Pyrrho's indeterminacy thesis owes most to the attitude towards sensible objects exhib- ited in some dialogues of Plato and, more remotely, by the Eleatics, although he admits that the additional connection with ataraxia, made by Pyrrho, is not found there (in this respect other possible sources present themselves, such 2 R.

As for the second question, B.'s thesis is, roughly, that Aenesidemus, who adopted Pyrrho as a figurehead, was still relatively close to Pyrrho's original position, whereas Sextus represents a - more strictly scep- tical - later phase of Pyrrhonism. Although these chapters contain much food for further thought, I am not sure whether either the 'parallels' in Plato, or B.'s account of the development of the Pyrrhonist tradition (which after all leaves the post-Aenesidemean 'sceptical turn' largely unexplained) will be able to clinch the issue (even in a merely probabilistic sense) of whether we should adopt the 'metaphysical' reading of Pyrrho. Yet the book offers a clear exposition and defense of a particular position in the debate on Pyrrho, and perhaps that is all we can ask for in this area. Both Chiesara and Bett reject an interesting emendation (proposed by Zeller and defended by some modern commentators) of a crucial passage in Aristocles' report: after the claim Ta ?sV OVJV npayguaca (nIV a&amp;rOv d(0poivE1v ?'i (art; &amp;6iapopx Iai arTIaj a v acia &amp;v?elLKplta the proposed emen- dation reads atl TO r #tc g t&amp;; aiotia0' t1; ' g&amp;)V jnjTE T'; 806a; &amp;X'OeiSetV nE iv6ecott, whereas the transmitted text has &amp;&amp; -roiro g,ure axa; a;iaci KTX. The emendation has been claimed to give a more smoothly running argument (yet an argument according to which the epistemological element is prior to the metaphysical!) and better Greek, in avoiding an asyndetic 61t toi6To. As for the latter point, Chiesara and Bett (in part relying on other scholars, such as Decleva Caizzi and Brunschwig) argue that there are examples of asyn- detic 6&amp;&amp; ToOTo to be found in later Greek texts. Bett (p. 26, n. 25) even adds that 'the point can be made without recourse to contentious examples', refer- ring us to a general remark in Denniston's Greek Particles to the extent that in comparable cases, with a backward-pointing pronoun, asyndeton may be unobjectionable. The point remains, however, that (at least insofar as I can see) we do not find this kind of asyndeton elsewhere in Aristocles. Bett and Chiesara also reject such philosophical arguments as have been put forward in support of the emendation, claiming that, on their metaphysi- cal reading of Pyrrho, the emendation is unnecessary. In his more exclusively philosophically-oriented book Sextus Empiricus and Pyrrhonean Scepticism,3 Alan Bailey goes one step further, and argues that the emended text would make no philsophical sense at all: 'If this emendation were to be accepted, then we would have to interpret Pyrrho as putatively inferring that things are equally indifferent, unmeasurable and inarbitrable from the premiss that nei- ther our sensations nor our opinions tell us truths or falsehoods. However this inference seems to have matters back to front: how are we supposed to arrive at the conclusion that neither our sensations nor our opinions tell us truths or falsehoods before we have undertaken an investigation into the nature of the I Alan Bailey, Sextus Empiricus and Pyrrhonean Scepticism, Oxford (Clarendon Press) 2002; xv + 302 pp.; ISBN 0-19-823852-5; GBP 40.00.</page><page sequence="4">74 BOOK NOTES world around us?' (p. 30, n. 12). One possible answer to this objection would be that the existence of conflicting appearances might in itself easily lead to this kind of scepticism, without any full-blown pre-existing theory about the 'nature of the world'. But perhaps I should not introduce Bailey's book on this pedantic note, and try to make clear, instead, what it has to offer. The book claims to focus on Sextus in the first instance, and as I have already indicated, its agenda appears to be predominantly philosophical: 'I hope that the present book can serve as a means of persuading present-day epistemol- ogists and anyone else interested in questions about justification and epistemic rationality, that any worthwhile discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of scepticism needs to respond to Sextus' version of scepticism' (p. viii). In line with this overall purpose, the more properly historical chapters 2-5, dealing with Pyrrho, Academic scepticism, the New Academy and the developments between Aenesidemus and Sextus, are less in-depth than the corresponding chapters in Bett's book (the chapter on Pyrrho, for example, responds pri- marily to Groarke, and relies on Long &amp; Sedley, adopting the 'metaphysical' interpretation of Pyrrho, while leaving most of the scholarly debate on the Aristocles text and on the philosophical position of Pyrrho out of account). However, the most important part of the book appears to be chapters 6-1 1, which offer a systematic account as well as a philosophical assessment of Sextus Empiricus' version of Pyrrhonism. Here Bailey argues, among other things, that Sextus' scepticism is neither self-refuting nor unliveable, thus attempting to defuse what are probably the most powerful arguments that have been put to work against scepticism by its opponents. The bibliography might have done the reader a service by indicating that five classic papers on these subjects (by Barnes, Burnyeat and Frede) have been conveniently reprinted together in M. Burnyeat &amp; M. Frede, The Original Sceptics: A Controversy, Indianapolis (Hackett) 1997. I am inclined to end my review of these attempts to classify Pyrrho and to tidy up our picture of the history of Pyrrhonism on a (perhaps irresponsibly) sceptical note. In his contribution to Giannantoni's volume Lo scetticismo antico (Napoli, 1981) Giovanni Reale catalogued no less than eight different (types of) interpretations of Pyrrho's original position. The most important ones current nowadays are the 'epistemological' interpretation, defended by Stopper and Annas &amp; Barnes, the 'metaphysical' interpretation defended by Bett and others, and the 'practical' or 'ethical' interpretation, defended by Jacques Brunschwig, most recently in his contribution to the Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy (to which I owe the reference to Reale's catalogue). Of course it is possible that just one of these interpretations happens to be the right one, and that the others have all somehow missed the mark. But it is also possible that there is something wrong with our attempts to capture Pyrrho under one neatly defined modern label, and to represent the history of ancient Pyrrhonism as a linear development with clearly separate, and still distinguishable, phases. There are indeed some indications that we should be</page><page sequence="5">BOOK NOTES 75 cautious. Thus on the one hand, the 'metaphysical' claim attributed to Pyrrho in the Aristocles text quoted above describes the 'indeterminacy' of the world in terms which clearly do refer to our cognitive capacities (a-rTaiOpTrTGC, avERi1cptpltr) and, on the other, the sceptical and 'epistemological' Sextus sometimes also uses language which appears to refer to the objective nature of things (npaiygaTa; cf. PH I, 190; 198-99). We encounter Richard Bett again, and on the same subject, in Ancient Scepticism and the Sceptical Tradition, a collection of papers which were read at a conference hosted by the Philosophical Society of Finland in Helsinki in 1996.4 The volume can be divided into three parts. The first three articles (R. Bett, 'What does Pyrrhonism Have to do with Pyrrho'; E. Spinelli, 'Sextus Empiricus, the Neighbouring Philosophies and the Sceptical Tradition'; and Tad Brennan, 'Criterion and Appearance in Sextus Empiricus', a reprint-plus- postscript of a 1994 article in BICS) deal with the interpretation of ancient scepticism in general. The next four (I. Sluiter, 'The Rhetoric of Scepticism: Sextus against the Language-Specialists'; S. Knuuttila &amp; J. Sihvola, 'Ancient Scepticism and Philosophy of Religion'; I. Niiniluoto, 'Scepticism, Fallibilism and Verisimilitude'; and M. Nussbaum, 'Equilibrium: Scepticism and Immersion in Political Deliberation') are more thematically focused. The remaining five contributions (J. Thijssen, 'The Quest for Certain Knowledge in the Fourteenth Century: Nicholas Autrecourt against the Academics'; M. Yrjonsuuri, 'Self- Knowledge and the Renaissance Sceptics'; L. Alanen, 'Cartesian Doubt and Scepticism'; and J. Annas, 'Hume and Ancient Scepticism') all deal with the later development of the sceptical tradition. Particularly useful are Brennan's assessment of the debate (with Jonathan Barmes, Myles Burnyeat and Michael Frede as protagonists) on the scope of the scepticism of the Pyrrhonists, and Knuutila and Sihvola's survey of sceptical arguments in the ancient philoso- phy of religion. Students of the sceptical Academy and of Cicero will be grateful for Charles Brittain's Philo of Larissa, the first book-length study of Philo.s It traces Philo's development vis-a'-vis the sceptical Academy of Carneades, and in relation to Antiochus and Aenesidemus, and includes a remarkable and original chapter on Philo and rhetoric. A useful appendix, containing all the extant testimonia on Philo, completes the book. Anyone familiar with the sources and with the recent scholarly literature (from Glucker to Tarrant, so to speak) knows that there is inevitably a lot here on which Philologists may disagree.

The latter assures us, on the dust jacket, that we are dealing with 'an example of what work in ancient philosophy should be like'. From Philo we move on to the tradition of dogmatic Platonism. Gretchen Reydams-Schils' Demiurge and Providence charts Stoic and Platonic readings of Plato's Timaeus.6 After an introduction on the Timaeus itself, the book con- tains chapters on the Early Stoics, Posidonius, Philo of Alexandria, Middle Platonists, the Didaskalikos and Calcidius. The book thus covers a wide range of authors and different periods, and it does so soberly and carefully, with- out, however, breaking much new ground. The chapter on the early Stoics strikes a sensible middle course between the view of those who are inclined to relate the Stoic two principles (matter and God) primarily to Aristotle (e.g. Hahm) and those who prefer to stress the influence of early Platonism (Kramer). R. provides a survey of the interpretation of Plato's Timaeus in terms of two principles (whether matter plus moving cause, as in Theophrastus fr. 230 FHSG, or as matter plus formal cause, as in Aristotle Metaph. 988a7-14), which we find in the early Academy as well as in the Peripatos, and sketches this tradition of interpretation as a plausible background for Stoic 'meta- physics'. She also offers an 'Interlude' on 'Antiochus of Ascalon, Cicero and the Academy', in which she argues, following Reid, Dillon, D6rrie and Levy, that Varro's account of Antiochean physics in Acad. I, 24-29 represents a 'remarkably Stoicized version of the Timaeus' (p. 128), and claims that this passage shows 'how one could borrow wholesale Stoic doctrine, claim it for the Old Academy and the Peripatetics by reading it into the Timaeus, as the Stoics themselves appear to have done, and yet continue to relegate the Stoics to the other side of the debate by failing to acknowledge their contributions and focusing on points of disagreement' (p. 132). All this sounds pretty con- vincing to me (but see below). Every chapter of this book is headed by a motto (taken from such authors as Pablo Neruda, Rainer Maria Rilke or Thomas Mann), which does not always bear an obvious relation to the con- tents of the chapter. But then of course Aristotle taught us that 'to aim at util- ity everywhere is utterly unbecoming to high-minded and liberal spirits'. I now move on to the volume Traditions of Theology, which contains the acta of the 8th Symposium Hellenisticum, held at Lille in August 1998.7 The book contains nine articles on Hellenistic theology (which here includes Plutarch and Philo of Alexandria).

In 'The Origins of Stoic God' David Sedley opposes the view that the account of Antiochus' physics which we find in Cicero (Acad. I, 24-29; see also above, on Reydams-Schils) should be regarded as an 'unhistorical retrojection' (p. 48) of Stoic elements onto the early Academy. In that case he argues, Antiochus would be guilty of 'falsification' and 'dishonesty' (p. 49) and we would have a 'case against Antiochus' (p. 59). The only alternative which S. recognizes is to accept this text as a real piece of early Academic physics. What is more, according to S. we are not dealing with a 'bland synthesis of fourth-century Academic physics' (p. 77), but with the system of one particular early Academic. After a careful and detailed review of possible candidates, S. ends up with Polemo, whom we already knew to have been at some point the teacher of Zeno (but about whose physics we hardly know anything). Hence Polemo is presented as the common ancestor of the (meta)physics-cum-theology of both Antiochus and the Stoics. So instead of viewing Antiochus as a Stoicizing Academic (as Reydams-Schils and many others have done), we should rather see the Stoics as Polemonians in disguise. Now it should be admitted right away that S. offers an in itself quite use- ful analysis of the Ciceronian text and that it is impossible to do justice in a mere brief summary to the subtle web of arguments by which he supports his hypothesis. Yet I also believe the hypothesis itself is not without its difficul- ties. First of all, Cicero presents his account of Antiochean physics as one which has been endorsed by a plural, yet indefinite 'they'. This is a bit odd, if we are dealing with the system of Polemo, and of no one else. Sedley dodges this problem by speaking of 'the Polemonian Academics' (p. 82), but who would these people be? Moreover, the context in Cicero would seem to suggest another referent for the unspecified 'they'. For the account of Antiochean physics immediately follows on an account of Antiochean ethics (I, 19-23), where we also find this plural subject, and where the subject is explicitly identified (I, 22) as 'the Academics and Peripatetics'. Moreover, it is imme- diately followed by an account of Antiochean logic, which is also said to cover this part of philosophy as it was treated 'by both schools' (ab utrisque, I, 30). So, pace S., the continuity between Cicero's accounts of Antiochean ' The other contributions are: B. Inwood, 'God and Human Knowledge in Seneca's Natural Questions'; M.

Spinelli, 'Sesto Empirico e l'astrologia'; D. Runia, 'The Beginnings of the End: Philo of Alexandria and Hellenistic Theology'.</page><page sequence="8">78 BOOK NOTES ethics, physics and logic does indeed suggest that we are dealing with some kind of 'bland synthesis' of Academico-Peripatetic physics (couched largely in Stoic terms, on which see below). S. might try to avoid this projection by claiming that what Antiochus (or Cicero) presents as the physics of the whole Academico-Peripatetic tradition is really the system of Polemo. But in that case Antiochus ends up as precisely the kind of historiographical 'fraud' S. does not want him to be (i.e. someone who illegitimately projected the sys- tem of Polemo onto the whole early Academy-plus-Peripatos). Secondly, on S.'s hypothesis it is hard to explain why none of our sources actually mentions Polemo as the father of either Antiochean or Stoic physics. Those passages where Polemo is explicitly connected with Zeno (Fin. IV, 45; Acad. I, 35) or, for that matter, with Antiochus (Acad. II, 132), all exclusively deal with ethics. One suspects, therefore, that S.'s hypothesis, which might at first sight seem attractive for its simplicity, is in an important sense too simple, viz. insofar as the dilemma on which it is based (we are dealing either with an illegiti- mate retrojection, or with the system of one particular Academic) may well be unnecessarily exclusive. Why shouldn't we assume that what Antiochus offered was not so much a historical falsification, but rather a historical recon- struction of the common ground between Academics, Peripatetics and Stoics, in terms which are mostly, but (as S. shows) not exclusively, Stoic? A pos- sible objection to this interpretation might be the following. Why would Antiochus, in purporting to present this tradition as basically the system of the Academy-plus-Peripatos, describe its core tenets in terms which are pre- dominantly Stoic? An answer however is not hard to find. In Antiochus' days Academic and Peripatetic physics and metaphysics were no longer the latest thing. The Academy had turned sceptic, the Peripatos was no longer a force to be reckoned with. Stoicism had taken over the torch and was now the chief representative of what Antiochus wanted to present as the broad anti- Epicurean tradition. If Antiochus really believed that Stoicism was idiosyn- cratic on just two points (rejection of the quinta essentia and materialism, Acad. I, 39), he may for the rest very well have chosen to use the main tenets and terminology of Stoic physics, as in his days the most modern and most fully worked-out representative of the tradition he wanted to promote. The title of Dirk Obbink's contribution on Philodemus, "'All gods are true" in Epicurus', will surprise most students of Epicurus. For does not a large part of Philodemus' On Piety (as well as much of the parallel account in Cicero's ND I) precisely consist in a sustained critique of the theology of the poets, the philosophers (especially the Stoics), the vulgi opiniones, and non- Greek cults such as the dementia Aegyptorum? In what sense, then, could an Epicurean maintain that all gods are 'true'? Obbink's answer, in his 'Conclusion' on p. 219, is this: these wrongly conceived 'gods' are no gods at all but bnoXikv1i; eu5ei5. This is surprising, not only because it makes the claim that all gods are true pretty meaningless, but also because it does not sit comfortably with O.'s earlier claim (pp. 213-14) that 'Philodemus commits the Epicureans to</page><page sequence="9">BOOK NOTES 79 the existence of an unspecified and infinitely large number of gods, such as might be conceived by ordinary peoples'. So perhaps we should step back and consider the alleged Epicurean or Philodemean pedigree of the claim 'all gods are true' somewhat more critically. Does Philodemus really say such a thing? No, he does not. His claim, in cols. 362-3 of De pietate (O.'s text 1Oa) is merely that whereas the Stoics say that 'there is just one god, not many and certainly not all those who are generally held in estimation [... .1 we [i.e. the Epicureans] assert the existence not only of all the gods which the Hellenic peoples claim to exist, but of even more' (Iij,uv oi) ,uBvov 0oovu; (paqiv ot HIav(XXEWve; aikXa xit nXct,ovCCq ctvwl key6vrcov). The (polemical) point is that whereas the Stoics are unable to preserve ordinary eusebeia, because of their alleged monotheism (Philodemus here plainly ignores the polytheistic aspect of Stoic theology), the Epicureans can account for polytheistic piety, at least to the extent that they acknowledge the (anthropomorphic) gods of the Greeks, and in addition a number of others (presumably those who also fit in with the Epicurean preconception) that are worshipped outside Greece. One is reminded of the remains of Philodemus' De Stoicis, where one of the points being debated is which of the two schools, Stoicism or Epicureanism, man- ages to stay closer to conventional morality, and where Philodemus objects to attacks on Epicurean hedonism by pointing at the quasi-cynicism of Zeno's Politeia. In any case, what is being claimed by Philodemus in On Piety is just that Epicureanism allows us to preserve more of the traditional gods than Stoicism, not that it acknowledges all gods as true. A comparable polemical point is made in col. 364 (text I la in O.'s article) which 0. plausibly interprets as implying that Epicurean theology does a bet- ter job than its Stoic rival in saving traditional forms of worship because, unlike Stoicism (at least that is what Philodemus claims), it acknowledges the possibility of some kind of reciprocity in the relation between gods and men: although the gods cannot physically and intentionally benefit or harm us, they can do so indirectly, i.e. through our wrong conceptions of them. Yet one question which these passages do not help to answer, contrary to what 0. seems to suggest, is the question of the ontological status of the gods. The evidence of Philodemus appears to be equally compatible with the traditional interpretation (gods exist as some kind of independent real entities), which after all has never denied that piety is a matter of having the right concep- tion of the gods, and with the interpretation of the gods as thought constructs (the remarkable popularity of which is no doubt partly due to its having been adopted in Long &amp; Sedley's collection of texts). Another question which, pace 0. (pp. 188-189) is still open, is the question of the relation between Philodemus' work and parts of Cicero ND I (direct dependence of Cicero on Philodemus, as 0. claims, or Phaedrus as a common source, as was suggested by Diels). Incidentally, I take the liberty of suggesting an alternative transla- tion of the first line of O.'s text lla, which reads as follows: g-ra' 6? . c E UO O. 0 cc ., K&amp; 0 ] o . .o</page><page sequence="10">80 BOOK NOTES Avp(Opnot; Tot1; OCoi[;] 8o06ovTaz; CRXxAXt T&amp;V a[tl]Ko[n]pa(XYrV6Tv, [61 ?vtot paxaiv. 0. translates 'In the next place, we must censure them [i.e the Stoics] for denying that people, who think the gods are the causes of injuries and evil to mankind, abstain (which some say they do) from unjust actions'. I think the following translation makes better sense of the Greek and would fit in better with the context: 'In the next place we must censure them for denying that the gods are the causes for injuries and evil to mankind, because of their conviction that the gods abstain from unjust actions, which some indeed say'. Two notable collections of articles which have appeared in the series Philosophie der Antike of Franz Steiner Verlag have been on my desk a lit- tle bit longer. Both contain the acta of Tagungen of the Karl-und-Gertrud- Abel-Stiftung (held in Trier and Wurzburg respectively), and both deal with the impact of Hellenistic thought on the philosophy of later antiquity. The first one, edited by Therese Fuhrer and Michael Erler ('in Zusammenarbeit mit Karin Schlapbach'), is entitled Zur Rezeption der hellenistischen Philosophie in der Spdtantike, and contains 15 contributions (in German, English and Italian).9 Together these contributions chart the attitude of later Neoplatonists towards the materialist philosophies of Epicurus and the Stoics (the value of which, if recognized at all, was often seen as merely propaedeutic), and dis- cuss the attitudes of critique, eclecticism, and sometimes partial adaptation that we witness among Christian authors. Let me just single out a few examples. In his 'Zur Epikurrezeption bei Laktanz' Jochen Althof first offers a useful overview of the attitudes taken by early Christian writers, up to Lactantius, towards Epicureanism (among them Arnobius' surprising adapta- tion of the Epicurean thesis that God cannot be subject to anger). He then examines Lactantius, who claimed that in his days Epicureanism was the 'most widespread' inimical system (a remark which should not be taken as a historical claim about the strength of the school as such in the early fourth century, but rather as implying that most ordinary people tend towards some form of hedonism which, hence, should be seen as a formidable opponent for Christianity to combat). Rainer Tiel's 'Stoische Ethik und neuplatonische Tugendlehre' describes the way Stoic ethics is incorporated in the Neoplatonic system in Simplicius' commentary on Epictetus' Encheiridion. In 'Evil with- out a Cause: Proclus' Doctrine on the Origin of Evil, and its Antecedents in Hellenistic Philosophy' Jan Opsomer and Carlos Steel discuss Proclus' doc- trine of evil, against the background of Hellenistic and Middle Platonist 9 Therese Fuhrer &amp; Michael Erler (eds.), Zur Rezeption der hellenistischen Philosophie in der Spatantike, Akten der 1.

It cannot be claimed that this book opens up entirely new vistas, but it does offer some useful surveys and sketches in some further details in our picture of this generally somewhat neglected phase in the Rezeptionsgeschichte of Hellenistic philosophy. The second collection of articles, edited by Michael Erler ('in Zusammenarbeit mit Robert Bees') is entitled Epikureismus in der spaten Republik und der Kaiserzeit and has, accordingly, a narrower focus." This book also originated from a conference, which, according to the editor (p. 10) led to the conclu- sion that 'naheres Zusehen erwies den Epikurismus der Kaiserzeit als lebendige philosophiegeschichtliche Tradition'. I am not sure whether this conclusion is actually supported by the pieces collected here, which to my mind rather suggest the idea of an increasingly marginal position for Epi- cureanism. Neverthelesss students of both Epicureanism and 'imperial phi- losophy' will benefit from such articles as Carlos Lvy's survey of Philo of Alexandria's attitude towards Epicureanism ('Philon d'Alexandrie et l'Epi- curisme'), Tiziano Dorandi's 'Plotina, Adriano e gli Epicurei di Atene', which discusses two inscriptions dealing with the relation between the imperial court and the Epicurean school in Athens, and Diskin Clay's 'Diogenes and his Gods', which discusses two new fragments of Diogenes of Oenoanda in their theological and cultural context."2 10 Other contributions: S.

Radford's Cicero, A Study in the Origins of Republican Philosophy is an intro- duction to Cicero's political philosophy at a pretty elementary level.'" Maybe its first chapters (summarizing the De re publica and the De legibus) serve this introductory purpose rather well, but for the rest there are considerable drawbacks. The chapter 'Cicero: Prophet of the Principate' takes up a position (the alleged influence of Cicero's political philosophy on Augustus' princi- pate) undermined long ago by Ronald Syme, who pointed out that such resem- blances as there may be can all be attributed to traditional political ideas as they could be found more widely in contemporary Roman political literature. R. is unnecessarily sceptical about the existence of such literature (on which see now G. Zecchini, 'Die staatstheoretische Debatte der caesarischen Zeit', in W. Schuller (ed.), Politische Theorie und Praxis im Altertum, Darmstadt 1998, 149-165). At a more general level one misses a discussion of Cicero's insistence on the importance of philosophy as a whole (as opposed to just political philosophy) for the politician, and in the bibliography one looks in vain for some important recent studies on Cicero: in particular the 1994 con- tribution of Gawlick and Gorler to the Neue Uberweg, probably the finest sur- vey of Cicero's philosophica available at the moment, but also H. Strasburger, Ciceros philosophisches Spdtwerk als Aufruf gegen die Herrschaft Caesars, Hildesheim 1990. More useful, especially for our readership, will be Margaret Graver's trans- lation, with introduction and notes, of books 3 and 4 of Cicero's Tusculanae Disputationes, i.e. the books dealing with emotions, and with ways of coping with them, as prescribed by Peripatetics, Epicureans and Stoics.'4 G. has man- aged to produce a clear and lively translation, and the comments (I l l pages) Epicurean texts from Oenoanda in Lycia'; M.

Incidentally, the discussion of Chrysippean psychology (also in relation to Posidonius and Galen) which we find in the last two appendices might have benefited from Teun Tieleman's Galen and Chrysippus on the Soul; Argument and Refutation in the de Placitis Books Il-III, Leiden etc. 1996. Finally (on Hellenistic philosophy), we now have a new English transla- tion, with introduction and footnotes, of Cicero's De finibus in the series Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy.'5 The smooth translation is by Raphael Woolf, the excellent and up-to-date introduction, with adequate ref- erences to the recent secondary literature and good suggestions for further reading, as well as the footnotes to the translated text, are by Julia Annas. In the Introduction she focuses on three characteristics of the De finibus: the dia- logue form, in relation to Cicero's commitment to Academic scepticism, the fact that the discussion centers on the question of moral ends, rather than on any other ethical category, and the fact that Cicero focuses on Epicureans, Stoics and Antiochus, leaving earlier philosophers, in particular Plato and Aristotle, out of account. As A. rightly points out, by Cicero's time the lat- ter two were classics from the past, and other theories were more current, a phenomenon which, as I argued above, may also help to explain why Antio- chus presented his version of Academico-Peripatetic physics in Stoic dress. This annotated translation, which easily replaces Rackham's Loeb translation, will prove extremely helpful in the context of university courses on Cicero or Hellenistic philosophy, and deserves to be widely used. I now turn to some new books on Greek science. Ptolemy's Geography is the only book on cartography to have survived from classical antiquity. It is a distinguished scientific work, which was influential for quite some time after its 'rediscovery' (and the subsequent proliferation of manuscripts) around 1300. Yet the most recent complete edition of the Greek text is C. F. A. Nobbe's of 1843-1845, and although good translations of parts of the work are available in German and French (the latter published in 1993 by Germaine Aujac), there is only one English translation, published in 1932 by E. L. Stevenson, on which A. Diller remarked, in his 1935 review in Isis, that 'to speak the plain truth, there is not a single paragraph that does not betray some essential and often gross error'. Hence we should be grateful for the excellent 15 Cicero, On Moral Ends, Edited by Julia Annas, translated by Raphael Woolf, series Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy, Cambridge (Cambridge University Press) 2001; xxxix + 158 pp.; ISBN 0-521-66061-0 (hbk), 0-521-66901-4 (pbk); GBP 25.00/GBP 9.95.</page><page sequence="14">84 BOOK NOTES new English translation, by J. L. Berggren and A. Jones, accompanied by a very good introduction, notes, eight appendices, and a series of high-quality plates and maps.'6 It is a partial translation, however, covering what may be termed the theoretical parts of the work. Its central part, which consists of a long list of some 8000 localities and coordinates intended to provide the basis for drawing maps of the world and its principal regions, has been left out. According to the authors, it would have been an impossible task to include it, given the defective state of the transmitted text (with lots of scribal mis- takes in the numbers) and our limited knowledge of the manuscript tradition. However, they do not leave us entirely empty-handed, for they do offer a sum- marizing description of, and a representative excerpt from, this more techni- cal part of the work. The introduction includes sections on what Ptolemy expected his readers to know (such as what Thomas Kuhn has labeled the 'two sphere theory' of the cosmos, with the sphere of the earth being at centre of the sphere of the heavens, a feature which facilitated the use of astronomical data to establish geographical positions, a practice anticipated already by Hipparchus, three centuries earlier), on the place of the Geography within Ptolemy's work, on Ptolemy's evolving conception of the world (the oikoumene of the Geography is larger than that of his earlier works, the Almagest and the Tetrabiblos), and on his use of the geographical data collected by Marinus of Tyre, and of other sources such as itineraria and periploi (records of sequences of, and distances between, places along roads and coasts respectively). In addition we are given information on Ptolemy's different plane map projections, on the manuscript tradition, on the maps in the manuscripts and on the reception of the work. The geographike' huphege'sis was actually a 'guide to drawing a world map'. Yet the authors plausibly suggest that, unlike smaller regional maps, the world map itself, drawn according to the instructions of Ptolemy, would have been too large to have been included in papyrus versions or early manuscripts (con- trast the tabula Peutingeriana which, with its distorted dimensions of 7 meters length and 34 centimeters height, reflects the constraints set by the original medium, probably a papyrus roll). They argue that the maps we find in the late medieval manuscripts (after the revival of interest in the work under Planudes) were drawn more or less freehand on the basis of the regional maps, rather than directly from the coordinates provided by Ptolemy. Full-colour pic- tures of some marvellous specimens of these maps in later manuscripts make this book still more attractive. The translation, which makes no attempt to smoothen Ptolemy's sometimes tortuous phrases, appears to be adequate (although in the very first sentence, 'world cartography is an imitation through 16 J.

This is a fine work of scholarship, which anyone interested in ancient astronomy or mathematical geography will use with great profit. Yet another work of eminent scholarship on Ptolemy is Andrew Barker's Scientific Method in Ptolemy's Harmonics.'7 B. claims that the Harmonics, rather than just being an object of study for the handful of scholars special- izing in ancient musical theory, deserves much wider attention because of its unusually self-conscious and explicit attitude with regard to its own method- ology and procedures. Ptolemy professes to adopt a complex combination of rationalism and empiricism which insists on a crucial role for experimental tests of provisional theory-based results. B. has occasion to show that in this respect Ptolemy appears to have lived up to his own scientific method, and that we do indeed find in the Harmonics what may be regarded as controlled experimental tests, a remarkable feature in the context of ancient science. In a final chapter ('Harmonics in a Wider Perspective') B. explores the fact that Ptolemy regards harmonics and astronomy as 'cousins', i.e. as mathematical disciplines which both have the objective of analyzing and understanding the formal basis of beauty, the one in the area of the audible, the other in the area of the visible. He shows that the kind of beauty which Ptolemy has in mind as the object of astronomy is not, as one might perhaps expect, the beauty instantiated in the fundamental structure of the heavens (such as the distances between the spheres or their relative speeds of movement), but rather the beauty of the temporary geometrical patterns of particular constellations or configurations, which may from a cosmological perspective be quite inci- dental. B. suggests that this shows that what Ptolemy calls astronomia in these passages is really astrology. This is indeed a possible, perhaps the only pos- sible, diagnosis, yet one which does give rise to further problems. Thus one wonders why Ptolemy's astrological Tetrabiblos (or rather Apotelesmatica, on which title see J. Mansfeld, Prolegomena Mathematica, Leiden etc. 1998, appen- dix 1) only occasionally refers to such harmonic considerations, as B. him- self makes clear; one also wonders how exactly the relation between beauty and astrological significance should be conceived. Andrew Barker and Lennart Berggren are also among the contributors to Science and Mathematics in Ancient Greek Culture, a collection of 17 essays, edited by C. J. Tuplin and T. E. Rihll, discussing various aspects of what we may collectively label as ancient 'science' (controversial though the term may be, there does not appear to be a better one to capture what we are dealing with here)."8 The volume attempts to locate science within the context of 17 Andrew Barker, Scientific Method in Ptolemy's Harmonics, Cambridge (Cam- bridge University Press) 2000; viii + 281 pp.; ISBN 0-521-55372-5; GBP 50.00.

Rihll (eds.), Science and Mathematics in Ancient Greek</page><page sequence="16">86 BOOK NOTES ancient Greek and Roman society and culture, by focusing especially on sci- ence as a cultural phenomenon and on the various external factors (religious, linguistic etc.) that shaped the theories at issue. In 'Words for Sounds', for example, Andrew Barker discusses some examples (from Archytas, Aristotle, and Ptolemy) of the way in which ancient physical acoustics was shaped by the metaphorical character of acoustic terms like O6v; and PBapvk, thus illus- trating the extent to which scientific discourse could be determined by the meaning of terms in common parlance and in non-scientific texts. J. L. Berggren's 'Ptolemy's Maps as an Introduction to Ancient Science' shows how the maps to be found in the MS tradition of Ptolemy's Geography (drawn according to Ptolemy's 'instructions', and hence fair specimens of the kind of maps he is concerned with, on which see above) can be used to illustrate some basic fea- tures of Greek mathematical geography; the piece also discusses some aspects of the theory of spherics, and the problems concerning the measurement of the circumference of the earth. In passing, B. has occasion to make pertinent observations on how a wrong estimate of the circumference of the earth (less accurate in fact than the famous estimate made by Eratosthenes) affects the accuracy of Ptolemy's maps, in exaggerating the longitudinal extent of the oikoumene, and on the problem of the measurement of longitudes. Harry Hine's 'Seismology and Vulcanology in Antiquity' also examines how scien- tists and philosophers collected their information, and to what extent the ideas of ordinary people contributed to the theories at issue. In addition, he dis- cusses the differences between the study of volcanic activity and the study of earthquakes in ancient sources. Alan Bowen's 'The Art of the Commander and the Emergence of Predictive Astronomy' argues that the detailed predic- tion of eclipses was not a concern for ancient astronomy until after non-sci- entific authors such as Polybius and Livy had established a topos about the usefulness of this kind of prediction in the context of military leadership. Even if we grant this, the conclusion that we are dealing with a 'critical step in the transformation of Graeco-Latin astronomy from a qualitative, explanatory sci- ence into a quantitative, predictive science' is perhaps less palatable, if only because in an important sense Greek mathematical astronomy (as opposed to philosophical cosmology) had been 'quantitative' (and descriptive rather than explanatory) all along. In 'Greek Mathematicians: a Group Picture' Reviel Netz provides an interesting overview of what we might call the 'sociology' of ancient mathematics: who were the mathematicians, how many of them were around where and when, what do we know about their teaching prac- tice and readership? For students of ancient philosophy proper the most interesting contributions to this volume are possibly Edward Hussey on 'Aristotle and Mathematics', Culture, Oxford (Oxford University Press) 2002; xvi + 349 pp.; ISBN 0-19-815248- 5; GBP 50.00.</page><page sequence="17">BOOK NOTES 87 Teun Tieleman on 'Galen and the Seat of the Intellect: Anatomical Experi- ment and Philosophical Tradition', and J. R. Milton's 'The Limitations of Ancient Atomism'. The last plausibly suggests that what made atomism such a suitable foundation for scientific theories in the age of the Scientific Revolution was, first, the distinction it allows one to make between primary and sec- ondary qualities, with the primary qualities all being of a geometrical nature, and secondly, the fact that body-and-void atomism provides a fertile soil for inertial mechanics. On the other hand, he also claims that any such link between atomism and science is completely absent in antiquity. On the con- trary, 'it is most appropriate to characterize Epicureanism not as a scientific movement, but rather as a secular religion - a doctrine whose contents are firmly naturalistic but which elicits from its adherents a type of commitment appropriate to a revelation from a transcendental source'. This claim is defended (pp. 180-182) on three main grounds: the fact that Epicurus explic- itly puts physics in the service of ethics (RS 11, 12), the fact that he claims (Ep. Hdt. 79) that detailed research into particular phenomena is much less valuable, and even potentially dangerous, and the fact that Epicurus appears to prefer multiple explanations - contrary to modem scientists who, accord- ing to M., regard such sets of alternative explanations as '(mildly) undesir- able' - while insisting that the divine nature should not be brought into any explanation. M. is not the first to draw this essentially negative picture of the methodology underlying Epicurean natural philosophy - one is reminded of Karl Jaspers' description of it as 'ein wissenschaftsfremdes, glaubendes Wissen, das eher Wissenschaftsaberglaube zu nennen ist' (Aneignung und Polemik, Munchen 1968, 54) - yet I do not believe the picture is entirely fair and accurate. Let me just suggest two qualifications. First, at Ep. Hdt. 79 Epicurus is not talking about 'research into particular phenomena' as such, but more specifically about the fact that knowledge of the movements of the heavenly bodies (as practised by mathematical astronomy, we may add) is rather inessential, as opposed to knowledge of their nature, which has just been claimed to be essential for happiness (Ep. Hdt. 78). Hence, when he is speaking of the dangers of this kind of purely astronomical research he is speaking of the dangers of quantitative model-making without a proper phys- ical or metaphysical basis; he is not disparaging detailed research as such. Secondly, that the divine should be kept out of physical explanations is not a matter of faith, but a claim which, according to the rules of Epicurean epis- temology, can be proved to be right, both on the basis of what can be known (rather than believed) about the gods (cf. the last sentences of Ep. Hdt. 78) and on the basis of what can be known about the nature of the basic ingre- dients of the world. Epicurus does not try to saddle us d tort et a travers with a naturalistic world picture, just because it can make us happy, but, on the contary, thinks it provides a sound basis for happiness precisely because, and insofar as, it can be proved to be right.</page><page sequence="18">88 BOOK NOTES All in all, however, this is a beautiful book, even if the subjects it discusses are pretty diverse.'9 It combines original reflection on such relatively better- known authors as Aristotle or Galen with new material on the more remote areas of Greek science, such as seismology or Hero's Belopoeica. In addition it signals lacunae and desiderata in the area of editions and translations, and opens up new pathways for further research. A pleasure to read, highly recommended.
