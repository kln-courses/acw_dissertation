<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY BY C. J. WARDEN Animal Laboratory, Department of Psychology, Columbia University F ROM the very earliest times man has interested himself in the life and behavior of infra- humnan organisms. Among the ancients, Aristotle (384-3zz B.C.) was the first to attempt a systematic account of plant and animal behavior and it is signi- ficant that he included in his natural history description the psychological as- pects of the organism. In his De Animai, Historia Animaliim and related writings he has brought together the results of his own extensive observations supplemented with the winnowings of the animal lore of earlier times. Aristotle very justly deserves to be considered the father of comparative psychology, as well as the founder of the other biological sciences and of natural history in general. His emphasis upon observation and the induc- tive method and his tacit adoption of a broadly comparative viewpoint mark his work as monumental in the early history of natural science. His conception of the organism was vitalistic in agreement with his general philosophical position, and his interpretations of behavior were tele- ological and often naively anthropo- morphic. His work was marred also by an extensive use of anecdotal material to supplement original observation. Never- theless, his contribution to the general development of biology and of compara- tive psychology was hardly equalled by any other writer previous to Darwin. The interest in natural history rapidly declined after Aristotle. Later Greek and Roman writers turned from the study of nature to metaphysical and ethical specu- lation in the main, while a few like Pliny (z3-79 A.D.) and Plutarch (c. 46- i2o A.D.) became mere compilers of anecdotes illustrating the sagacity of the higher animals. During the early cen- turies of the Christian era the normal interest of mankind in natural science was displaced to a large extent by religious activities and theological speculation. Pliny was widely read, but the biological and psychological writings of Aristotle were generally unknown, ignored, or even proscribed in Christian lands. The revival of the natural history writings of Aristotle in Christendom about the middle of the thirteenth century marked the beginning of an important advance in the field of biology. This came about very largely through the influence of Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, and such contemporary encyclo- pedists as Vincent of Beauvais, Bartholo- mew Anglicus and Thomas of Cantimpre. Unfortunately it was the body of facts contained in the writings of Aristotle rather than the scientific spirit of the Stagirite that was revived at this time. His works on natural history and psychol- ogy, interpreted by orthodox scholars, became a new source of authority instead of an inspiration to further observation of nature. The major interest seems to have centered around the problem of the essen- 486</page><page sequence="2">DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY 487 tial difference between the mental life of man and animal. Some solution to this problem appeared necessary in the interests of a rational theology. The animal is guided by blind, impulsive instinct, divinely implanted, according to the orthodox writers of the time, while man is a rational being, distinguished by the capacity for voluntary activity involv- ing moral and spiritual responsibility. The revival of the spirit and method of Aristotle in the field of natural history came about as a part of the scientific renaissance of the sixteenth century. The Historia Animalium of Gesner, the famous Swiss naturalist, which began to appear in I55I, and the more specialized works of such contemporary naturalists as Belon, Rondolet and Turner mark the beginnings of the new movement which finally led to the replacement of arm- chair compilation by original observations of animal life and behavior. The three centuries extending from Vesalius to Darwin were crowded with discoveries and new developments in the field of biology. The invention of the micro- scope, about the opening of the seven- teenth century, broadened the realm to include the hitherto unknown micro- organisms, and made possible the mar- vellously detailed study of insect structure which characterized the work of Reaumur and his school. Notable contributions were also made by this group in the field of behavior. The study of the structure and function of plants and animals became more and more specialized, and the old natural history was gradually broken up into the major biological subsciences as we know them today. Up to the time of Darwin infra-human behavior was more or less ignored by the leading biologists in favor of taxonomical, morphological, physiological and embryological investi- gations, although the naturalists and explorers of the preceding century con- tributed an extensive literature of field observations that is not wholly without value. Questions relating directly to the nature of animal mind and behavior engaged the attention mainly of the philosopher, or of the scientist in the role of philosopher. The well known view of Descartes (I596-i650) and his followers that even the higher animal is merely an automaton (la bete machine) contrasts sharply with contemporary vitalistic and anthropomorphic tendencies, while both, insofar as they recognized the primacy of man, were in general agreement with the orthodox view which had come down from the middle ages. In a very important sense Darwin may be considered the founder of modern comparative psychology. The publica- tion of The Origin of Species (I859) brought the problem of mental evolution to the fore and stimulated a widespread and lasting interest in the mental life and behavior of infra-human organisms along broadly comparative lines. As we shall see, the natural development of this interest into a well-balanced and syste- matic science was held in check for several decades by the controversial aspects of the evolutionary doctrine. After Darwin, however, psychology began very properly to consider itself a division of biology rather than of philosophy, to divest itself of metaphysical and mentalistic categories and to broaden its scope to include more and more the entire infra-human field. The movement has taken on the aspects of a young but rapidly growing natural science during the last quarter century, especially in America, where the condi- tions for development have been most favorable. At the present time compara- tive psychology inay justly lay claim to separate status as a biological discipline corresponding in general scope to the older</page><page sequence="3">488 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY sciences of comparative anatomy and comparative physiology. It has firmly established itself in a more or less clearly defined field with its own systematic problems and its own experimental methodology. An account will now be given of the more important developments from the time of Darwin onward grouped according to the following outline: I. The Anecdotal Period (1859-c. 1890) i. The influence of Darwin 2.. The anecdotal movement 3. Contemporary scientific contributions 11. The Experimental Period (c. 890- ) I. Beginnings of the movement 2.. Experimental developments 3. Theoretical tendencies THE ANECDOTAL PERIOD The influence of Darwin Although modern comparative psychol- ogy took its rise from the evolutionary movement initiated by Darwin, it gave little promise of developing into a syste- matic science until about the beginning of the last decade of the nineteenth century. In the meantime, it suffered along with biology in general from the strong oppo- sition which the traditional science and theology offered to the evolutionary hypothesis. The early interest lay almost wholly in a defense of the notion of mental continuity. So long as attention was being directed chiefly to the more contro- versial aspects of Darwin's view a normal development along well-balanced and experimental lines could hardly be expected. The anecdotal school arose as the first and most direct result of the influence of Darwin. These early workers felt called upon to hold a brief for human- like mental traits in the higher animals. In -the absence of better evidence at hand they made a most unwarranted and extravagant use of anecdote, supplemented at best by casual observations of the natural history type. Like his great predecessor Aristotle, Darwin was primarily a naturalist in the broadest sense rather than a psychologist. He was not well versed in traditional psychology and had little or no acquaint- ance with contemporary thought in this field. He dealt with psychological prob- lems only insofar as they came within the province of his larger interest in biological evolution. We are not surprised, there- fore, to find him accepting in an uncritical manner the terminology of the popular psychology of his day. In his treatment of the mental life of animals he was naively anthropomorphic in much the same vein as Aristotle and tnade much the same conservative use of anecdote. Neverthe- less, it is almost impossible to over- estimate the influence of his genius on the general field of psychology. The evolu- tionary concept gave unity and meaning to such disconnected facts as had been accumulated, and led in time to an exten- sive use of the genetic method and to the functional vs. structural interpretation of psychological phenomena. The view of Darwin that "the mental faculties of man and the lower animals do not differ in kind, though immensely in degree" was highly revolutionary in nature. Orthodox science as well as orthodox theology still held tenaciously to the Hebrew cosmology and insisted upon the immutability of species. And this, in spite of the evolutionary teachings of Buffon, Lamarck and many of the leading philosophers of the preceding century.. Moreover, the conception pre- vailed that the mental life of infra-human organisms could be summed up in the term instinct-a biological faculty, or a mysterious entity constituting the primal psychical endowment of a beneficent</page><page sequence="4">DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY PLATE I - _k __ ... s. i L '_ .. . . j j . . ., s ER. * :;R 3|_ b '- uj:- _t" tes:"L w IEt _ 22w a ;:L D e F _ ^.' .:ai1 ^ t., ,,.

Man, as the sole possessor of the faculty of reason, was sharply marked off from even the higher animals on the mental side. This view was, of course, nothing more or less than the qualitative dichotomy between man and brute that had survived from the middle ages. The Darwinian assumption of physical and mental continuity within the organic world, and the serious attempt to account for both along broad genetic lines aroused bitter and determined opposition on all sides. The evolutionary conception, regardless of its specific formulation, brought with it several problems of great interest to comparative psychology. First, there was the question as to the origin of mind comparable to that regarding the origin of life in biology. On this point Darwin had nothing to say on the positive side. 'I have nothing to do with the origin of the mental powers,'' he writes, "any more than I have with life itself. We are concerned only with the diversities of instinct and of the other mental faculties of animals of the same class." (X9, I:3 I9). Given life and mind, or living organisms with a mnental endowment, he concerned himself with the evolu- tion of complex and varied types from the simple and unitary. A second prob- lem, and the fundamental one, for Dar- win, related to the factors which may have operated in the several stages of organic, including mental evolution. And since instinct and intelligence were generally considered to be essentially different mental types the development of both had to be accounted for. A half century previous to the publica- tion of The Origin of Species, Lamarck (63) had attempted to show the modus operandi of the development of the instincts on a naturalistic basis. The explanatory prin- ciple of Lamarck was later elaborated by Spencer, among others, and called by him the "lapsed intelligence theory." Lamarck held, in brief, that use and disuse of various parts, or members of the organism brought about more or less definite, local changes which were trans- mitted from generation to generation. He did not deny the influence of the direct effect of environment (Buffon's principle) but stressed functioning (use and disuse of parts) as the all-important factor, and he included conscious as well as purely physiological functioning. It is the desire of the giraffe to feed on higher foliage, accompanied by the stretching of the neck, for countless generations, as the expression of that desire, that finally brought about the development of the unusually long neck. Instinctive patterns have been developed pari passu with morphological change; habitual responses initiated by conscious desire, or some form of internal or psychic urge, have been passed on as a cumulative heritage and finally fixated in the species as in- stincts. Lamarck's view is obviously meaningless apart from the generally discarded theory of the heritability of acquired morphological and functional changes in the organism. Darwin appealed in the main to the principle of natural selection to account for the evolution of instincts and of mental life in general. He did not deny the operation of other factors, such as those previously applied by Buffon and Lamarck, but he considered these rela- tively unimportant, and as merely supple- mentary to his own principle of selection. Functional types, like structural types, had been evolved by the gradual accumu- lation of favorable variations in the struggle of the organism to survive. The more complex and elaborate instincts had developed gradually out of the less com- plex, and these in turn out of still simpler.</page><page sequence="6">490 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY He says: "If it can be shown that instincts do vary ever so little, then I can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving and continually accumulating variations of instinct to any extent that was profit- able. It is thus, as I believe, that all the most complex and wonderful instincts have originated." (z 9, I:3 I). The evolution of intelligence was explained on precisely the same basis- variation, natural selection and heredity. Darwin considered it absurd to deny a low order of intelligence, including imagi- nation, reason and will, to many of the higher animals. He believed implicitly that the mind of man with all its wealth of emotional life' and its moral sense had developed naturally out of the mind of the higher animals possessing these same attributes in a rudimentary way. In The Descent of Man, and in The Expression of the Emotions, originally planned as a chapter of this treatise, he attempted to illustrate his own conception of how this develop- ment had actually taken place. In his opinion, the conscience and the moral sense constituted the greatest prac- tical difference between man and the higher animals. With keen insight he perceived that insofar as these were actually possessed by man they were the natural accompaniment of his highly developed intellectual and social life. It seems highly probable, so he says, that "any animal whatever, endowed with well marked social instincts, would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as soon as its intellectual powers had become as well developed, or nearly as well developed, as in man." (30, I:68). In accounting for the development of complex mental functions and moral attributes Darwin applies the principle of natural selection very broadly, placing great emphasis upon the operation of social and intellectual factors in the process. In a state of nature, perhaps, selection may tend to the preservation of one individual against another, but as soon as the social instincts arise the preservation of the group becomes the chief end to be attained. Utility to the group, as well as mere individual strength and endurance, becomes a factor in sur- vival. Sympathy, mutual aid, parental and filial affection, and other social behavior as well as individual cunning, discrimination capacity, etc., operate as increasingly important determinants of the course of evolution among the higher animals. In man himself, the use of fire, traps, tools, weapons, signs, language, etc. are instances of how intelligent behavior, making for group solidarity and social organization, may dominate the evolutionary trend. The anecdotal movement Although Darwin did not make an explicit application of his theory to man in the first publication of his views in The Origin of Species, the point was sensed immediately that man must be included in any thoroughgoing evolutionary scheme. The full implications of the theory, as Wallace phrases them, were "that man's entire nature and all his faculties, whether intellectual, moral or spiritual, have been derived from their rudiments in the lower animals, in the same manner and by the action of the same general laws as his physical structure has been derived." (88, page 46I). Even such ardent sup- porters of the theory of organic evolu- tion as Huxley (59, 6o) and Wallace (88) did not accept completely the views of Darwin, above expressed, concerning the mental evolution of man. They insisted that certain of the higher mental faculties, and particularly the moral and spiritual capacities, could not be accounted for on Darwinian principles. The doctrine of mental evolution as</page><page sequence="7">DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY 491 inclusive of the genus homo thus became the storm center of the whole controversy over Darwinism. The notion that mind as well as bodily structure and func- tion had developed from natural causes amounted to a denial of the primacy of man in any but a purely quantitative and naturalistic sense. The mind-body dichotomy was rather clear cut in the public mind because of the fact that the philosophic thought of the time was more or less permeated by Cartesian dualism. The bitter attacks of theologians and religious leaders, who thought they saw in the new doctrine the collapse of moral culture and religious faith, added tense- ness to the situation. It was this stub- born refusal on all sides to accept the fact of mental evolution, insofar as it applied to man, that was in large part responsible for the anecdotal movement in compara- tive psychology. The anecdotalists confined their efforts almost wholly to the collection of stories, sometimes of -doubtful veracity, empha- sizing the human-like behavior of the higher animals. The lower organisms were of slight interest since the traditional science and theology had placed the impassable gap to mental continuity between the higher animals and man. The problem thus practically narrowed down to showing that the higher animals possessed a rudimentary intelligence, out of which the more diversified human mental life might conceivably have developed. The need of the hour, if the doctrine of mental continuity and evolu- tion were to survive, was for a mass of concrete evidence, tending to show the beginnings of rational, emotional, social and moral capacities in the higher ani- mals. In the absence of first hand obser- vations, appeal was had to the anecdote, which had always been in good repute in illustrating unusual conduct in animals in natural history collections. Darwin himself made considerable use of anecdote and few if any of the writers on natural history of this period avoided it altogether. Scores of anecdotal collec- tions appeared in which the tendency to humanize and eulogize the mental powers of higher animals reached the ridiculous. These collections often included material from Aristotle, Pliny, Plutarch and other of the ancients in addition to that gathered from contemporary story-mongers. In many cases the anecdotes were taken from unreliable sources or were mere hearsay, and in all cases the moral to the story was that the animal concerned was "almost human" if not actually so. The collec- tions of Romanes (74, 75, 77), Biichner (26), Lindsay (66) and Perty (70) are among the most extensive and dependable of those which have survived to our own day. Romanes in particular attempted to select his stories with due concern as to the reliability of the original sources. The essential argument in much of the anecdotal material is difficult to follow on account of the loose manner in which fact and fancy are thrown together. In general, however, the anecdotes may be grouped so as to constitute the following three main lines of evidence in support of the contention that the higher animals possess a rudimentary human mind: (i) anecdotes purporting to show some measure of reasoning ability, (2) anec- dotes supposedly illustrating social be- havior of a high order, and (3) anecdotes in which the characteristic human emo- tions indicative of sympathy, shame, deceit, courage, timidity, suspicion, jealousy, curiosity, emulation, sense of justice, sense of humor, etc. are apparently exhibited.

REV. BIOL., VOL. III, NO. 4</page><page sequence="8">492. THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY would properly belong in Class i. Imita- tion, purposive cobperation, intercom- munication of ideas and plans of action by means of signs, or sounds that serve the language function would fall in Class z. The fallacy of anthropomorphic analogy reached its worst in the fanciful interpre- tations of Class 3, the underlying assump- tion seeming to be that if the animal acts like man it also feels like man. The following criticisms may be urged against the anecdote as a source of scien- tific information regarding the mental life and behavior of animals: (i) that the observer is likely to be untrained and unable to give an accurate account of the happening, even if his intentions are of the best; (z) that interpretative elements are likely to be confused in the report with factual, making it impossible for the scientist later to separate the two; (3) that the happening even when adequately reported is usually an incident cut off from the essential genetic antecedents (both individual and phyletic) which would explain it and give it proper significance; (4) that the happening, in the nature of the case, represents highly selected and atypical behavior that can have little or no statistical validity; (5) that even if the tendency of mankind to humanize the animal-whether in a scientific or a literary mood-is restrained, errors of memory and of transmission (if verbal) are likely to enter; and (6) there is the difficulty of selecting reliable, authentic material from the various available sources. It is evident that the method, even when guardedly employed, which usually is not the case, hardly deserves to be considered scientific in the strict sense. The anecdotal collections were widely read and the popular imagination was deeply stirred. In fact, the wide appeal to anecdote by the protagonists of the doctrine of mental evolution was not altogether without value as a reaction against the older instinct-reason anti- thesis. Just as philosopher and theo- logian had previously twisted the facts in order to create an insuperable gulf between the mind of man and animal, so now by the opposite bias that gulf was not only bridged, but the difference between the mind of man and animal unduly mini- mized-owing in large part to the contro- versial temper of the times. The general acceptance of the view of Darwin that the entire mental life of man must be included in the general scheme of mental evolution made the appeal to anecdote no longer necessary or excusable. Anecdotalism and anthropomorphism at the level of Pliny and Plutarch shared honors with specious reasoning and far- flung analogy. The natural philosophers were obsessed with pedantic attempts to achieve a monistic Weltanschavsung regard- less of fact or logic-a natural reaction, engendered by the general evolutionary movement, against the current dualism. The cell-soul theory of Haeckel (so) and the psychade theory of Schultze (5i) are examples of the type of speculation which sought to find in each living cell a psychic substrate or attribute, usually held to be below the conscious level but analogous to mind in higher organisms. Serious consideration was given to such fanciful discussions of plant life as appears in Fechner's Nanna (I848) and contemporary writings of the same sort. The notion that ontogeny repeats phy- logeny in mental development was applied very literally, especially with respect to man himself. The classic example is the psychogenetic scale worked out by Romanes and elaborated in his Mental Evolution in Animals, and in the com- panion volume on the mental evolution of man. He compares in great detail the mental status of the embryonic and early</page><page sequence="9">DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY 493 developmcntal stages of the human with the mental levels of the various phyla of the animal kingdom as these were sup- posedly revealed by the anecdotal evidence at hand. At birth the human infant has reached the mental level of the echinoder- mata. Some twelve successively higher stages are then recapitulated before the fifteenth month, at which time the mental level of the dog and the anthropoid ape has been reached. Romanes seems to have considered his psychogenetic scale as a scientific application of the principle of mental continuity, and so it was looked upon by many of the foremost thinkers of the time. Contemporary scientific contributions Fortunately, not all of the interest aroused in comparative psychology was absorbed in fruitless speculation or in col- lecting anecdotes. Original observations of plant and animal behavior were being made constantly during the period and many of these have proven to be of genuine value. The naturalists made a worthy contribution to our knowledge of animal life and behavior under natural environ- mental conditions. There was a marked tendency for field studies to become more and more intensive and precise. In fact the observation of the period, at its best, often approached and sometimes attained the experimental level. Impor- tant developments in the related fields of comparative anatomy and comparative physiology made available a wealth of fundamental facts that were necessary before genuine progress in comparative psychology could be made. The structure and function of the sense-organs and nervous system of the lower forms in particular were studied extensively by many of the leading biologists of the day. The findings in these fields usually involve behavior data of a more or less simple sort, and no attempt will be made to distinguish between the contributions of anatomist, physiologist, naturalist and psychologist in the following discussion. The works of Darwin, Wallace, Hudson, Houzeau, Bates and Belt are examples of the better and more comprehensive general field studies. As will be noted, these deal in large part with the relatively unknown fauna of various countries covered by scientific expeditions. The volume of Hartmann on anthropoid apes, of Espinas on the social life of animals, and of Poulton on animal coloration are impor- tant illustrations of field studies of more limited extent. The classic natural history of the period was Brehm's Thier- leben, which occupied much the same position in the nineteenth century as the Histoire Naturelle of Buffon had in the preceding century. Except for anatomical-physiological investigations the vertebrates were rela- tively neglected aside from field studies of the type indicated above. It was decidedly easier to gather anecdotes than to make careful and long continued obser- vations at close range and naturally the birds and higher mammals were especially favored with anecdotal lore. Rarely does one find in the literature of the period covering infra-human vertebrates a study at once as intensive and as comprehensive as that of Kussmaul (6X) or Darwin (34) on the human infant or that of Preyer (72) on the human child. The report of Romanes and his sister (74, 483-498) on the cebus monkey and that of Spaulding (83, 84) on birds are among the better class of first hand observations made at close range on higher forms during this period. Much more serious work was attempted on various classes of the invertebrates. Binet (z4) has given us a good account of investigations on the behavior of the protista previous to the epoch making</page><page sequence="10">494 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY Protisten-stvdien of Verworn (I889). He argues, on the theoretical side, for a psychic vs. a purely physico-chemical explanation of the multiform activities of unicellular organisms. The volume of Romanes (76) describing his experiments on jelly-fish, star-fish, and sea-urchins con- trasts sharply with his anecdotal and theoretical treatises. Preyer's experi- mental study of the starfish deserves special mention, as well as Darwin's volume on the earthworm. Our knowl- edge of the behavior of the lower inverte- brates was greatly enriched by the careful investigations of a large number of biologists working along various lines. An impressive list of names might be given which would include 0. Hertwig, R. Hertwig, Gegenbauer, M. Schultze, Lan- kester, Haeckel, Mach, Plauteau, Delage, J. Massart, Engelmann, Bert, Graber, and Merejkowsky as well as many others. The arthropoda, and the insects in particular, were especially singled out for study by anatomist, physiologist and naturalist alike. The interest aroused in insect life by Reaumur and his school during the latter half of the eighteenth century was continued into the present period by Straus-Durkheim, Newport, Leydig, Kraepelin and others. The naturalist Fabre (40, 4I) made a most extensive series of observations on insect life over a period of more than forty years. Among the many workers who might be named, Wasmann, Forel, Claparede, Eimer, Emery, McCook, Huber, and Graber deserve mention. The earlier work of Lubbock and of the Peckhams (69) also properly belongs to this period. The work of these investigators differed widely in quality and in some instances had little permanent value. The natu- ralists showed their usual tendency toward anthropomorphism and it is not always easy to separate the element of fact from the interpretative statement of the obser- vation. The writings of Fabre, "that inimitable observer," as Darwin called him, are especially open to criticism. His theo- logical bias unquestionably led him to grossly exaggerate the uniformity of insect behavior and many of his find- ings have been shown to be unreliable by later and more dependable observers. In his zeal to uphold the instinct-reason dichotomy as separating man and beast he strenuously opposed Darwinism, and argued for the mediaeval conception of instinct as the original endowment of the creator. Animal instinct was to him an irresistible inborn impulse, always routine and uniform-albeit an "inspiration" which at its best might even simulate intelligence or reason. He was strongly opposed to physicochemical explanations of insect behavior and reported his find- ings in anthropomorphic language that would have done credit to an anecdotalist of the extreme evolutionary school. He finds in instinct-an eternally inscrutable faculty-the answer to every problem that arises in connection with the behavior of insects, and indulges in flights of fancy that betray a literary rather than a scientific imagination. The theological viewpoint of Fabre is shared by the well- known entomologist, E. Wasmann, S. J., who in our own day has written a large volume (89) against the theory of evolu- tion. In this and other of his writings he argues for the instinct-reason dichotomy, although his observations, unlike those of Fabre, are held in high esteem by present day entomologists. He holds that the evolutionary psychology, by denying the essential difference between the mind of man and animal "not only raises brutes to the dignity of man, but degrades man to</page><page sequence="11">DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY 495 the level of the brute," the practical conse- quences being "the demoralisation and brutalisation of man." Important developments took place during this period in the field of plant behavior (47, 53). The term tropism had been introduced by the botanist DeCondolle as early as I835 and long before this Knight (i8o5) had shown the effect of gravitation on the direction of growth in seedlings. Aside from the work of Darwin and F. Darwin, which will be discussed at some length below, valuable contribtutions to the behavior aspect of plant life were made by Sachs, Pfeffer, Strasburger, Weisner, Stahl and many other botanists of the period. Plant behavior was usually thought of as being purely physiological and as lying entirely outside the pale of psychology and hence it escaped for the most part the evil influence of anecdote and anthropo- morphism. Darwin himself gave no little time to the experimental investigation of various phases of plant life. His earlier interest was largely confined to morphological variation under domestication as an in- stance of the evolutionary principle, and to such related topics as fertilization and sexual dimorphism. However, he later took up the problem of plant behavior, and in I875 published a volume on climb- ing plants and one on insectivorous plants, the latter attracting wide attention be- cause of the novelty of the material. Darwin's most notable contribution to the study of plant behavior was The Power of Movement in Plants, written in collabora- tion with his son, Francis, and published two years before his death. The book is replete with simple but ingenious experi- mental methods, some of which have become classic, and with results inter- preted more often than not with rare insight. Darwin found that practically all parts of the plant-stems, leaves, roots, flowers, etc.-normally perform circum- nutation movements even when shielded from external stimulation. From this general fact he was led to believe that all tropistic responses of plants were merely variations of this inner power of movement directed in part by such external energies as gravity, light, pressure, etc. He was among the first to recognize special sensitive zones such as tip of root and shoot, transmission of excitation through the tissues to point of curvature, and the general similarity of plant and animal behavior in its more fundamental aspects. The tip of the radicle, which exhibits a multiform sensitivity in pene- trating the ground, seemed to him to act "like the brain of one of the lower animals" in directing the general move- ment of the root. The contribution of the anecdotalists was relatively insignificant in comparison with that of these various groups of workers who, in one manner or another, were making direct observations of plant and animal behavior. At best the anec- dotal material served only a temporary purpose in connection with the contro- versy over the mental evolution of man. Furthermore, the anecdotalist movement was a positive evil insofar as its influence tended to retard scientific investigation of the behavior of the higher animals. The observation of the naturalist and the more careful studies of anatomist and physiol- ogist, insofar as their findings were relevant, represent the more permanent contribution of the period to comparative psychology. THE EXPERIMENTAL PERIOD Beginnings of the movement Although Darwin stands apart as the great pioneer spirit in the rise of modern</page><page sequence="12">496 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY comparative psychology both he and his immediate successors-the anecdotalists- confined their attention largely to the problem of psychogenesis and made no seri- ous attempt to develop the science along systematic lines. The behavior material which various groups of biological workers gathered from time to time in connection with anatomical, physiolog- ical or naturalistic studies was ignored, for the most part, by contemporary psychologists or distorted by anthropo- morphic interpretation. Not until about I890, when we come to the work of Lubbock, Verworn, Loeb and C. Lloyd Morgan, do we find the movement giving definite promise of developing into a systematic biological science. In fact these four men may be considered the outstanding leaders in the reform that ushered in the new epoch. The new movement began as a revolt against both the viewpoint and the method of the earlier post-Darwinian period. The humanizing tendency, when given free rein, had gone to such absurd lengths as to make a reaction inevitable in the interests of a common sense sanity. The anecdotal method, as the handmaid of extreme anthropomorphism, could hardly hope to survive after the general accept- ance of the doctrine of mental evolution, although for a time it had seriously threatened the normal development of observational and experimental methods. The new movement, as we shall see, was characterized by (i) the use of greater precision in observation with a growing emphasis upon carefully controlled experi- ments of the laboratory type and (z) a more critical use of anthropomorphic analogy, which led in time to a rejection of it altogether in favor of a strictly objective or behavioristic position. On the basis of initial important contri- bution, Lubbock, the English naturalist, antedates the other members of the group by almost a decade, his experimental studies on insect behavior appearing in collected form in i88z. In a sense he and Morgan represent the direct line of conservative leadership in comparative psychology following Darwin, Romanes and others of the anecdotal period. Both Lubbock and Morgan were stoutly opposed to the use of anecdote and extremely cautious in appealing to anthro- pomorphic analogy. Lubbock's impor- tance in this historical connection rests primarily, as we shall see, upon his priority in the application of experimental technique to behavior problems. His work was practically complete when Morgan began to come into prominence, although his direct influence on laboratory methods (QI i) extended well into the present century. In attempting to evaluate the contribu- tion of each of the four outstanding leaders to the new movement the work of Verworn and Loeb on the lower organisms may be conveniently treated together. Both of these eminent physiologists, even in their earlier work, which chiefly con- cerns us here, devoted themselves to observational and experimental methods of a relatively high order, and both attempted to give a strictly objective account of the activities investigated. Although Verworn antedates Loeb some- what, the influence of the lacter was more widely felt because of the important controversy aroused by his radical tropism theory. The pioneer experimental studies of Lubbock on insects mark him as the founder of the modern laboratory method of approach. This work, which had occupied him for many years, was brought together in his earlier volume (i66) in i88z. He seems to have originated the maze method, making first use of the now</page><page sequence="13">DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY PLATE 2. 1 4 SPECIMENS OF APPARATUS DEVISED BY LUBBOCK FIG.

To him should go the credit also for first making definite use of the puzzle device or problem method under laboratory conditions. He con- structed his varied problem apparatus upon the principle that the best way to test animal intelligence is "to interpose some obstacle which a little ingenuity would enable them to overcome" between animals and such natural incentives as food, the young, freedom, etc. Although the various devices of Lubbock were especially adapted to insect manipulation, this principle is the fundamental one involved in most later types of problem apparatus (7ii) as used for all sorts of animals. Lubbock not only originated two of our most important general laboratory methods-maze and problem situation-but also invented a most ingenious glass-covered nest for ants in which he kept some groups under con- tinuous observation, under fairly normal living conditions, for over seven years. He claims to have been the first to mark particular ants and record their individual behavior on an extensive scale. He checked up by his more exact methods the conclusions of earlier and contemporary observers of insect life and showed that the current anthropomorphic interpreta- tions in this field were usually based upon careless or insufficient observation. His own results, arranged in tabular form, appear modern indeed in comparison with the reports of most other naturalists of the time. Lubbock made extensive use of the "'preference method" in his study of the visual range, color vision, and other sensory capacities of insects, but he adopted a critical attitude in the matter of interpreting his findings. The preference method had been used earlier by Bert, Graber (I35) and others in attempting to determine discrimination ability in various types of invertebrates. As commonly employed in color vision work, the animals to be tested were equally distrib- uted over the floor of a long narrow box covered with colored glass arranged in spectral order. Withdrawal from, or collection in a given section-under a given colored glass-was usually inter- preted to mean not merely differential sensitivity, but genuine preference based upon pleasure-pain or even aesthetic factors. Lubbock insisted that the method showed no more than differential sensitivity and explicitly denied that sensitivity to wave length as thus induced in an insect or other animal meant sensa- tions possessing the characteristic human quality. That is, we cannot argue that an object that appears red to a normal human being likewise appears red to the sensitive animal. In his later volume (I67) Lubbock made the first serious attempt to cover the field of comparative psychology without re- course to the prevailing anecdotal litera- ture. He drew his facts mainly from the anatomists and physiologists, and with due caution from the naturalists-the very sources indeed that the anecdotalists in general ignored. The first ten chapters deal with the sensory capacities of animals, including man, the three follow- ing chapters are devoted to his favorite topic-the instincts and intelligence of insects, while the final chapter on the dog includes mainly a report of his experiments on his own dog, Van. That he preferred to leave the treatment of the higher animals thus incomplete rather than resort to anecdotal evidence indicates the depth of his devotion to scientific fact. In introducing laboratory methods into</page><page sequence="15">498 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY comparative psychology and in taking in general an objective attitude in matters of interpretation he showed himself to be several decades ahead of his time. The early work of Verworn (z17) and of Loeb (i6i) on the lower organisms was a continuation of that of the botanists, anatomists, physiologists and zoologists of the preceding period. Following the excellent work of Engelmann (12z7, i2z8) and others, Verworn carried out the most thoroughgoing investigation of unicell- ular forms that had been made up to that time. His experimental findings were brought together in the Protisten-studien (I889), which occupied much the same position then as the well known volume of Jennings (i49) does at present. Ver- worn emphasized the apparently spon- taneous, or internally stimulated activity of unicellular forms, while insisting upon a physico-chemical explanation of their behavior. It is true that he indulges in speculation which suggests the influence of Haeckel's monism, but this is entirely absent in his later volume (I894). Here (zi8) he gives a clearer and more straight- forward statement of his tropism theory and of his general view regarding the nature of the behavior of organisms. He differed from the more radical position of Loeb in much the same way that Jennings, his pupil, came to differ later. Loeb began his work on the plant-like, sessile Coelenterates and was the first to make extensive use in the analysis of animal behavior of technique similar to that developed earlier by the botanists. Taking his cue from the tropism studies of the plant physiologists, he attempted to determine to what extent the orientation responses of lower animals to external stimuli could be described and explained on a similar basis. He was led to the conclusion that most, if not all, of the behavior of lower animals was tropistic in much the same sense as that of plants, and therefore unconscious. The physico- chemical explanation of Loeb was new and startling, primarily because of his insist- ence that lower organisms react wholly on the non-psychic level. This point was generally conceded insofar as the plant kingdom was concerned-fortunately the anecdotalist and the philosopher had, in the main, kept aloof from the lowly plant. The new view, and particularly the tropism theory of Loeb, was little short of a complete return to the mechanistic position of Descartes, and came as a fatal shock to the post-Darwinian humanizers. This bold attempt to analyze the behavior of lower organisms by physiological methods and to explain it in purely objective terms was little short of heroic in view of the anthropomorphic babblings of the times. It was, indeed, a far cry from the notion of Romanes that the insect flies into the candle flame out of an innate curiosity to the contention of Loeb that it is forced to do so in a very literal sense when presented with the appropriate external stimulus. Among other criti- cisms of Loeb's theory the satirical attack of Claparede (ii8) is interesting. He pointed out that an observer from a distant plaflet might well suppose that human activity was also largely tropistic and be led to speak of the doctor-tropism, corpse- tropism, food-tropism, etc. of mankind. Somewhat later Nuel (I83) made a direct application of the tropism principle to the behavior of man in a thoroughly serious but unconvincing manner (zoi). From the work of Loeb, as Brett remarks, "arose a new type of comparative psychology, the mechanistic school of Bethe, von Uexkiill, Th. Beer and Ziegler: for these writers the higher animals have consciousness, the lower do not." This group of physiologists were mainly interested in experimental work upon the</page><page sequence="16">DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY 499 lower forms and insisted that physico- chemical process and the resulting be- havior of the organism constituted the proper subject matter of the science within this field. They denied the validity of inferences concerning the presence and nature of mental states in lower animals, agreeing in general with Loeb that the ability to profit by experience should be the accepted criterion of psychic life, or consciousness. Moreover, they opposed the use of the subjective terminology of traditional human psychology in describ- ing the activities of lower organisms. In a joint paper issued in I899, Beer, Bethe, and von Uexkiill (93) proposed to elimi- nate entirely such terms as sensation, sense-organ, memory, learning, etc. In- stead of the terms hearing, smell, and sight, they would speak of phono-recep- tion, stibo-reception and photo-reception, and for sense-organ they proposed the term reception-organ. Loeb objected strenuously to the usual interpretation of "preference method" results in terms of sensation, choice, algedonic or aesthetic factors. He insisted that evidence for differential sensitivity was not in itself evidence of qualitatively different sensations or even of the presence of sensation at all. He believed the tropism theory could be broadened out to cover all instinctive, and perhaps even much of the socalled intelligent behavior of organisms, although he accepted con- sciousness as a concomitant of the higher associative processes. The theory solved, so he thought, the metaphysical problems involved in current conceptions of con- sciousness and volition. The importance of Loeb, in this historical connection, does not involve the question as to the ultimate truth or falsity of his special theory, either as at first announced or as later elaborated. The physico-chemical views of Verworn and Loeb provoked widespread discussion and were factors of major importance in clearing away the loose, unscientific attitude that prevailed. Morgan, as well as Lubbock before him, maintained the right of the investi- gator to study the activities of animals for their own sake, without special reference to the all-absorbing controversy over mental evolution, and thus helped to give a systematic orientation to compara- tive psychology. Morgan's Introduction (176) covering the vertebrates together with Lubbock's earlier volume (I67) limited largely to invertebrates were important indicators of the general trend in this direction. The canon of Morgan, which was first announced in the Introduc- tion (I894) deserves to rank along with the tropism theory of Loeb as a signal attack against the current humanizing tendency. While it was distinctly less radical in spirit, nevertheless it was widely opposed at first, although it came in time to serve as the rallying cry of the more conservative group. The canon runs as follows: "In no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of the exercise of a higher psychical faculty, if it can be interpreted as the outcome of the exercise of one which stands lower in the psycho- logical scale." This is merely the law, of parsimony applied to comparative psy- chology; it is an insistence that the same critical attitude which had been long accepted in the methodology of general science be also adhered to in this field. Even the conservatives could hardly reject a principle so fundamental and reasonable, and the influence of this canon on the later development of the science has been most important. For though it did not rule out entirely the fallacious practice of attempting to infer the subjective life of the organism by anthropomorphic analogy, it did serve to introduce a mneasure of restraint into such speculation.</page><page sequence="17">500 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY The influence of Morgan on the early thought of the period can hardly be overestimated. His writings show a broad sympathy and a sound scholarship in dealing with the more theoretical prob- lems of comparative psychology that has scarcely been equalled since, except, per- haps, by Hobhouse in his Mind in Evohe- tion. Nor was he a mere theorist-his contribution to early experimental de- velopments, though somewhat limited in scope, was of first rate importance. In the Introdnction (I894) he refers repeatedly to his genetic studies of incubated chicks and ducklings and distinguishes the types of instinctive behavior characteristic of each. In Habit and Instinct (I896) he gives a more complete account of this work, which he has extended, in the meantime, to include wild ducklings, moorhen chicks, and partridges. He also investigated various aspects of habit formation in young birds and emphasized the method of trial and error in animal learning. As early as I89I (I75) he speaks of the "trial and practice" element in "incomplete instincts" and of the maturation factor in "deferred instincts." These early studies of Morgan on birds are important as marking the beginnings of the application of laboratory methods in any extensive way to the higher verte- brates. The material of Habit and In- stinct was delivered as the Lowell Lectures in the spring of I896 at Harvard Univer- sity, and parts of it later at Chicago, New York, and other university centers, and doubtless had much to do with the out- burst of experimental work in America that soon followed. Thorndike began his studies on instinct and habit formation in the chick at Harvard in the fall of I896 and Kline independently began somewhat similar work on the chick at Clark the following year. Morgan seemrs to have been the first to make use of the "incu- bator method" in his genetic studies of birds, and his plan of keeping the young in the incubator for varying periods of time after hatching before testing them foreshadowed the more recent work of Breed and Shepard (t9i2). Although the views of these four leaders regarding the nature of animal life and behavior appear to be widely divergent as individually formulated, the differ- ences were much less important than the general points of agreement. Lubbock and Morgan, no less than Verworn and Loeb, were stoutly opposed to the older anthropomorphism. Moreover, the tropism theory of Loeb was, in a sense, merely the application of the canon of Morgan-albeit somewhat strictly-to the lower organisms. Both Lubbock and Morgan believed in adopting physico- chemical explanations of behavior in all cases in which they seemed adequate. Loeb admitted consciousness to such higher anitnals as gave conclusive evidence of the ability to form associations. The main point of difference concerned the stage in phylogenetic development at which the psychic factor emerged, and this is clearly a matter of minor impor- tance in the last analysis. Furthermore, each of the leaders rejected the method of anecdote and each was a pioneer experi- mentalist in his own special field. It is apparent from all the evidence at hand that a worthy beginning had been made toward the establishing of compara- tive psychology on a reasonably sound theoretical and experimental basis. The further developmnent during the present century of experimental methods and results will be given in some detail in the following section. The final section will show the gradual emancipation of the subject matter of comparative psychology</page><page sequence="18">DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY 50I from the domination of human psychology and the definite commitment of the science to an objective, natural science viewpoint. Experimental developments In spite of such promising beginnings, the experimnental movement did not get well under way until about the opening of the present century. Aside from the experiments of Morgan on birds, only a few scattered studies had been made on the higher vertebrates. The decade centering around I900 is especially important as marking the beginnings of labora- tory work on the mammals. A more widespread application of experimental methods to lower forms also took place, as we shall see. The work began more or less independently along many lines and the leadership includes physiologists and zoologists as well as psychologists. The developments were so varied and exten- sive, and so much originality was shown in the application and elaboration of methods that had come down from the earlier pioneers, that this decade appears to be no less epochal than the former one had been. Before tracing through the more impor- tant lines of progress developing out of this period, it may not be amiss to state the fundamental ground of distinction between mere observation and genuine experiment. As in all the natural sciences the distinguishing mark of experimental procedure in the strict sense is the con- sistent use of artificial controls resulting in precise, quantitative results. From Aris- totle downward, naturalists have intro- duced more or less simple controls of one sort or another into field or indoor obser- vation of behavior when an occasional problem seemed to suggest it. Usually, however, such controls have involved no more than the arrangement of a selected stimulus situation within the natural environment of the organism, without seeking to control, in any adequate way, the free movements of the animal under test. The ingenious devices of Fabre are good examples of crude attempts to control the stimulus situation in the open. The study by Galton of auditory range in birds is an interesting application of this semi-experimental method to higher forms. Galton had the quaint habit of concealing his newly invented whistle in his hands, and producing various pitches from time to time, while walking about in the zoological parks of London, in the mean- time making a tabulation of the different species of bird that appeared to take note of sounds of various pitch. In the strict sense, however, experi- mental behavior methods require control of both the stimulus situation and the organism under test by some appropriate technique of the laboratory type. Obvi- ously no sharp line can be drawn between careful field observation and simple experi- mental procedure. In a very proper sense, the laboratory may be considered as a limited and controllable field in which isolation and quantitative measurement of selected aspects of behavior can be made. As a rule experimentalists have shown a sympathetic interest in adapting experi- mental situations and general living conditions in the laboratory to the natural proclivities of the animal tested, insofar as these have been adequately understood. Our emphasis upon experimental develop- ments in this historical connection does not mean that systematic observation is to be rated as of slight value in behavior work. Field observation must always hold a place of honor in the biological sciences and particularly so in comparative psychology. Many important problems depend for their final solution upon competent field work, either wholly or in part. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied</page><page sequence="19">502. THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY that the development of refined experi- mental methods affords a good index of the growing maturity of a science, indi- cating an increasing ability to adequately define and solve its problems. The decade centering around I900, as stated above, witnessed a most remarkable outburst of experimental work of a highly original order in many fields. It will be convenient, in tracing out the more important lines of progress, to be,gin with the work on lower forms and follow systematically through to the higher. In addition to outlining the major events of the decade under review, attention will be called, from time to time, to a few of the more outstanding later developments. The interest aroused in the sensitivity of plants by the theory and work of Darwin led to continued experimentation among the botanists (47, 53). Nemec, Haber- landt, Ricca, and later Fitting may be named among the more prominent investi- gators of tropistic behavior. In the field of genetics and evolution, De Vries, Bateson and others made notable contribu- tions. The interest in the behavior of lower organisms aroused by the work of Ver- worn and Loeb proved to be permanent. Loeb in particular continued to the last his experimental investigations and many of his students were inspired to enter the field and attempt to solve the problems of behavior by the physiological approach. The work of Jennings (I49), which began to appear about I897, gave a new impetus to the study of the lower organisms. Jennings-who had studied at Jena under Verworn-may be thought of as continu- ing the tradition of Engelmann and Ver- worn in contradistinction to that of Loeb. Like both of these earlier workers he was impressed by the variability of behavior even in such simple forms as the protozoa and emphasized, as Verworn had done, the internal factors in response. Jennings held that the characteristic behavior of lower forms is less simple than Loeb's tropism theory would seem to require; that their responses are typically variable to the same stimulus as their physiological states vary from time to time and from individual to individual; that instead of being direct and forced in Loeb's sense their responses are usually of the "trial and error" type, which favors modifi- ability. The opposing views of Loeb and Jennings may be partially explained by the fact that the former worked for the most part on sessile, or relatively inactive forms, whereas the latter studied mainly the more active, free-swimming types. As thus viewed, their work both theo- retical and experimental appears to be complementary rather than antagonistic. Among other early workers on lower organisms, Parker, Holmes, Yerkes, and Mast in America; Bethe and von Uexkiill in Germany, and Pieron and Bohn in France deserve special mention. Parker's study on the behavior of Metridium appeared in I896, and each of the other investigators began their work on lower organisms either before, or soon after I900. A few scattered applications of experi- mental methods to the study of the behavior of the arthropoda took place during the decade. Following the rather casual test of learning ability in the crab by Bethe (I897), Yerkes adapted the maze method to this form in i90o2, and extended it to the crayfish the following year. A further study of learning ability in the crab was made by Spaulding in I904. The bulk of work on insects and other air- breathing arthropoda continued to be either field observations or semi-experi- mental investigations of sensory capac- ities and intelligence. Such careful workers as Wasmann, Forel, Claparede, and the Peckhams continuing from the</page><page sequence="20">DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY PLATE 3 Z' s' :'M s f I. H. S.

The work of Bethe (Ioo, IO', I03) on the ant and bee will serve as examples of the more strictly experimental type of investiga- tion. In I899, Kline (i54) extended the maze method to the wasp, and in I9OI, Fielde employed, in her study of the ant, a maze more complex than any Lubbock had used. The extensive work of Parker (I85, i86) on fishes, which began about i9oz, may be taken to mark the beginning of a more systematic study of the behavior of the lower vertebrates than had hitherto been made. The contribution of Parker and his pupils in America, and later that of Hess (042) and others in Germany, has been confined mainly to the field of sensory capacities. The earliest study of habit formation in lower vertebrates seems to have been that of Thorndike (I899) on Fundulas, making use of a four compartment maze. The well-known experiment of Triplett (2i6) on the perch appeared two years later. Aside from several early experiments on the auditory sensitivity of the frog, Yerkes deserves credit for having adapted the maze method to the turtle in I9OI, and to the frog two years later. The most important event of the decade by far was the application of laboratory methods to the higher vertebrates on an extensive scale. An excellent beginning had been mtiade by Morgan in his simple tests of instinctive and learning capacities in thechick, and in other species of birds. Morgan's work on the chick was followed up by Thorndike (2mz) and by Kline (I 54), both of whom made use to some extent of the incubator method of Morgan. The work on learning and imitation in the chick was further extended by Thorndike, who arranged more complex problemn situations than Morgan had done. His improvised labyrinths of simple design, made by setting up books, or other small objects, represent the first use of the maze method on birds. A little later Small devised the Hampton Court maze, which was used in the original or modified form by Porter, Rouse and other early workers in their systematic studies of the behavior of birds. To Thorndike, working at Harvard and Columbia, and to Kline and Small of the Clark University laboratory belongs the credit for independently adapting experi- mental methods to the study of mammals. As early as I897-98, Thorndike and Kline devised various types of problem box, the monograph (2i2) of the former on the cat and dog appearing in June, i898,while the first report (I 5 4) of the latter on the white rat was published the following January. A second report by Kline appeared in April, I899 (I 5 5), while the more com- plete investigation of Small making use of Kline's problem boxes was published in January, I900. During the two years previous, Small had made a careful genetic study of the behavior of the white rat, and had constructed the well-known Hampton Court maze. In January, I9OI, he reported his now classic maze-learning experiment on the white and brown rat, including also preliminary tests on the r6le of smell and vision. This was the first application of the maze method to mammals; in fact, the term "maze" and the now general use of this method in the animal laboratory dates from the work of Small. The white rat, first used in behavior work by Kline and Small, soon became the standard laboratory animal in connection with the more systematic lineg of research. Although the credit for beginning the experimental work on mammals properly</page><page sequence="23">504 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY belongs to Thorndike, Kline, and Small, the influence of previous workers, partic- ularly Lubbock, should not be over- looked. As we have already noted Lub- bock originated both problem method and maze method, and used both extensively in his study of insects. In answering the criticism of Mills against his own work, Thorndike (2Iii) expressly states that "Lubbock used practically the same method with insects" and remarks that it is "odd" that Lubbock's principle of interposing an obstacle between an animal and some incentive such as food, etc. had not been "sooner followed with mam- mals." The influence of Mills is seen clearly also in Small's genetic study of the white rat. As early as i886, Mills (I7I, page 3i) had organized an association for the study of comparative psychology at McGill University and his later observa- tions on both wild and domestic animals, particularly the cat, have served as a model for most later genetic studies. After making due allowance for earlier influences, it must be granted that the task of adapting these experimental methods to the mammals required a high order of originality and ingenuity. The problem situations of Thorndike and Kline were, after all, quite different from those of Lubbock, while the maze of Small was more like the wasp maze of Kline than the simple paper mazes of Lubbock. The problem boxes of Thorndike naturally differed from those of Kline, since each had planned puzzle devices with special reference to the particular type of animal to be tested. The general method of the two men differed also in one impor- tant respect. Thorndike confined his animal within the problem boxes, placing the incentive on the outside, or in certain cases utilizing mere escape from the apparatus as the incentive. Kline and Small, on the other hand, adopted the more natural method of placing the incen- tive within the problem box, thus leaving the animal relatively unrestrained in working the puzzle device and securing the food inside. The techniques employed in the study of imitation also differed in much the same way. Thorndike confined the imitator in a compartment imme- diately adjacent to the puzzle box requir- ing it to observe the imitatee attacking the problem through a screen or through openings in the side of the box. Kline and Small, and later Hobhouse and Porter, allowed the imitator and imitatee to work at the puzzle device together without restraint. The main criticisms urged against Thorndike's work on the cat and dog by such men as Morgan (178, ziz, review), Hobhouse ('43), Kline (153) and Small (2.09) centered around the alleged unnat- uralness of confining his animals in such small boxes (c. 2o X iS X i2. in.). Mills, with less show of judgment, went further and insisted that valid results could not be secured on the higher animals by laboratory methods. He (72s, I73) criti- cised not only the work of Thorndike but also that of Kline, Small, and Hobhouse, all of whom had taken unusual care to make the test situation natural. Al- though neither Small nor Thorndike found evidence of rational imitation in common mammals, the conclusions of the latter were especially singled out for attack, largely because of the contro- versial style in which they were presented. It was quite generally urged also that the negative finding of a single study did not afford sufficient support to Thorndike's general denial of imitative and rational learning in all mammals below the primates. From these beginnings the laboratory study of the higher vertebrates spread</page><page sequence="24">DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLCGY PLATE5 / 77~~~~~~~X 1 2 E 3 EARLY APPARATUS OF KLINE AND SMALL FIG. i.

During the years I899-9ioo Thorndike (z.i) in America and Hobhouse (I43) in England, work- ing independently, extended experimental methods to the monkeys, the reports of both appearing in I9OI. Hobhouse was interested primarily in imitative and ideational behavior and tested the cat, dog, otter, and elephant as well as the monkey and chimpanzee. Like the Clark group, he allowed his animals considerable freedom of movement when under test, and Thorndike (2i?, page i9o) himself in his work on monkeys adopted the more natural method of placing the incentive inside and the animal outside the problem boxes. Although Hobhouse was doubt- less influenced by the previous work of Thorndike, Kline and Small in America, he devised several new and ingenious tests which have proven to be of great value, especially in the study of primates. Several of these, such as the draw-in test, lock and key test, box and pole text, box placing test, and what we now call the "Umwege" test, have been used with minor modifications by Shepherd, Watson, Yerkes, Kohler and other later students of primate behavior. The study of mammalian behavior was fostered in America by the psychologists and several important research labora- tories were established almost imme- diately. The work of Thorndike did not lead to the establishment of an animal laboratory unit at Columbia. At Clark, however, regular facilities for animal research were provided as early as I898, under the supervision of Kline, who also offered a practicum in comparative psychology. Hall, and particularly San- ford gave encouragement to the new venture. Porter's studies on birds were begun in i9oi, and Kinnaman's work on monkeys, making -use of the Thorndike type of problem box and the Hampton Court maze, began about the same time. The laboratory at Clark (II9) represents the first attempt of American psychol- ogists to place the new experimental science on a permanent, institutional footing. A research laboratory was established by Watson in I903 at the University of Chicago. During the two preceding years, Watson had been engaged at Chicago in making a genetic study of the behavior of the white rat, including a comparison of neurological maturation at the different age levels. He began with apparatus patterned after that of Kline and Small, but in the course of the work devised the inclined plane problem box for rodents as well as several new types of maze, and greatly improved the technique of Small for isolating the sensory factors in maze learning. The Animal Education (I903) of Watson stands out as being the most systematic and comprehensive psycho- biological investigation of a mammalian form that appeared during the decade under review. An important series of researches involving operative methods was begun by Watson, assisted by Carr, in I905 (Xz9, II4) to determine the sensory factors involved in rodent maze learning. In I908, Watson established a research laboratory at the Johns Hopkins Univer- sity, the work at Chicago being con- tinued under the supervision of Carr. Among other valuable contributions to methodology, Watson (-59) should be credited with the color vision apparatus of the standard Yerkes-Watson discrimina- tion method (i9ii) and the well known Watson circular maze. In variety, amount and importance of experimental contribu- tion during the past quarter century, Watson ranks second to none among the psychological group. Carr early became interested in an analysis of the problem of animal-human</page><page sequence="27">5o6 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY learning. He (I13) was the first to make use of a human maze (I9I I) and originated the stylus maze as a means of comparing more directly the motor learning of rodent and man. The work of Perrin, Webb, Pechstein, and Wiltbank represents the beginnings of the use of the maze in the analysis of the learning process forwhich the Chicago laboratory under the leader- ship of Carr has become so justly noted. Carr also devised the alternation problem (I09) and made important contributions to our knowledge of the temporal factor in the formation of associations in ani- mals. In I909, Carr originated the de- layed reaction method, using the white rat, and this was later extended by Hunter to the dog, raccoon, and human child. The first important contribution of Yerkes to mammalian behavior was The Dancing Mouse (I907). In x899 he estab- lished an animal laboratory at Harvard University (z54) and, as we have noted, did worthy pioneer work in the applica- tion of experimental methods to the invertebrates and lower vertebrates. In connection with his study of the dancing mouse, Yerkes developed a general method of testing animal discrimination in which both reward and the electric shock as punishment could be utilized. This method was further standardized as the Yerkes-Watson discrimination method in I9II, Yerkes (X59) being responsible for the animal control section and the light vision apparatus. The Yerkes Multiple Choice method (X56) was devised in I9I3 for the study of ideational behavior in higher vertebrates, and such forms as the crow, pig, monkey, orang-utan, chim- panzee and gorilla have been tested by this method by Yerkes, with the col- laboration in some cases of his pupils. The work of Haggerty (I899) on imitation in monkeys was one of the more impor- tant early studies from the Harvard labora- tory, which was very prolific under the direction of Yerkes. A number of scattered investigations of mammalian behavior among the earlier work also deserve mention. Allen's study (I904) of the guinea-pig was somewhat similar to Watson's genetic study of the white rat which appeared the previous year. The work of Cole and of Davis on the raccoon (I907) marks the beginning of experimentation on that form. Berry tested imitation in the white rat (I906) and in the cat (I908), Yoakum (I909) made a series of laboratory tests on the squirrel, and Shepherd (I9I0) added his study to the work already done on the monkey. A valuable contribution to laboratory methods was made in I9I1 by Hamilton (I39) in originating the Quad- ruple Choice method, which has been extensively used by him in the analysis of reaction-types in the higher vertebrates. At approximately the same time that Thorndike, Kline and Small began their laboratory studies on mammals in Amer- ica, Pavlov, the Russian physiologist, was beginning his work on the conditioned salivary reflex of the dog. The primary interest of Pavlov and his earlier pupils was in brain physiology rather than in the behavior aspect of their work, and the broad application of the conditioned reflex, or response, method to the analysis of animal and human behavior has come more largely from the writings of Bekh- terev and other psychologists. The earliest characteristic experiments in con- ditioning were those of Boldireff (Pavlov's Lab., i904-5) including as secondary stimuli nearly all modalities. In I907 Bekhterev and his pupils extended the method to the respiratory mechanism of dog and mnan; in I908 to the human speech reflexes; in I909 and later to vasomotor movements and to the motor reflexes of</page><page sequence="28">DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN COMPARATIVE PSYtHOLOGY 507 finger, knee, and foot. In I907, Krasno- gorski began using the method in the analysis of infant and child behavior. About the same time the conditioned reflex method was carried to Germany by Nicolai and Kalischer and became known to the English speaking world through Pavlov's Huxley lecture (I87) and later writings. The early work of Watson and Lashley (z34) had much to do with creat- ing an interest in the method in America. The method was adapted by Zeliony (Pavlov's Lab., I905) to the investigation of sensory discrimination in animals and has been employed by the Russian school since in much the same way as the Yerkes- Watson method has been used by the American group. The early use of the method in sensory discrimination work was criticised by H. M. Johnson and other American experimentalists. In I9I0 Pavlov made an appeal for a sound-proof laboratory where adequate control of the stimuli could be had; this was built shortly afterward. The contribution of Pavlov and Bekhterev and of their numerous students to the analysis of both receptor and motor behavior of mammals has come to be very generally recognized and a beginning has been made toward extending their method to the lower organisms. The experimental work on the higher vertebrates has been developed, in the main by the psychologists, particularly in America, where comparative psychology has been increasingly recognized in both class room and laboratory. The Journal of Animal Behavior and the Behavior Mono- graph series were established in I9II to take care of the growing interest in research. Both were suspended in I9I7 on account of world war conditions. In i91i, The Journal of Comparative Psychology arnd the Comparative Psychology Monograph series were begun as a continuation of the older journal and of Psychobiology, two volumes of which had been published during the interim. More recently, The Journal of Genetic Psychology and the Genetic Psychology Monograph series have broadened out to include studies in animal behavior. A canvass of the field (zzi) in i9z6 showed that systematic courses in com- parative psychology were being offered in no less than thirty of the leading institu- tions of learning in America, while twenty or more research laboratories were in active operation. Important, but less organized research work is also being carried forward by workers in various foreign countries. Theoretical tendencies The newer movement under the leader- ship of Lubbock, Verworn, Loeb, and Morgan had aimed, on the theoretical side, at the overthrow of idle speculation in comparative psychology. The imme- diate effect of this reaction against the post-Darwinian anthropomorphism was, however, merely to shift the speculative interest to new problems, or to the old problems as newly formulated, and to raise the general level of theoretical discussion. For several decades, compara- tive psychology continued to be domi- nated by an introspective psychology that was striving, often with small success, to break away from philosophy. Biological and metaphysical tendencies were strangely intermixed, and the occasional attempts at logical synthesis were highly arbitrary and superficial. The speculative element was eventually thrust into the background by the growing success of the experimental movement, as outlined in the previous section, and by the rise of behaviorism. During the two decades following I890, the theoretical discussion centered around such related topics as (i) the point in the phylogenetic series at which consciousness</page><page sequence="29">508 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY may have emerged, (X) the criterion of conscious life in the individual organism, and (3) criteria of psychic levels in infra- human organisms. The futility of specu- lation concerning such problems became more and more apparent, and about i9i12 a movement to adopt a straightfor- ward objective, or behavioristic viewpoint came to the fore under the leadership of Watson. Since that time, comparative psychology has been attempting to read- just itself to a strictly natural science position as the logical outcome of the Darwinian conception of psychology as a biological science. An account will now be given of the more important theoretical tendencies that led ultimately to the liberation of infra-human psychology from the dominating influence of human psychology and speculative philosophy. The tropism theory of Loeb offered a distinct challenge to the old school that had taken more or less for granted the supposition that even the lowest organ- isms possessed some form of psychic life. Loeb held the elemental component of all psychic life to be "the activity of the associative memory" and maintained that unless an organism could be shown to possess the capacity to form associations its behavior must be considered uncon- scious. "Our criterion," he says, "puts an end to the metaphysical ideas that all matter, and hence the whole animal world possesses consciousness." The logical conclusion is that tropistic and instinctive behavior is wholly unconscious and that such organisms as are incapable of defi- nitely profiting by experience are nothing more nor less than reflex machines. This general point of view was accepted by Beer, Bethe, and von Uexkiill (93), Nuel (I83), Ziegler (zo, 2.6i) and others, and by Bohn (I05, I07) in a somewhat modified form. On the basis of this criterion, this group contended that most probably the invertebrates generally were devoid of consciousness. At any rate, an adequate account of their behavior could be given in physico-chemical and behavior terms and without reference to any possible psychic life. In much the same vein, Titchener (zi 5) denied consciousness to plants, although accepting the current view that all animal forms are conscious in some sense. Bethe's contention that ants, bees and other insects are mere reflex machines stirred up no little controversy among the entomologists. Wasmann (zz5, zz6), although denying rational intelligence to even the higher vertebrates, insisted on assigning some sort of psychic life to insects, while Buttel-Reepen (io8), and especially Forel (I3 i), held that insects give evidence of a relatively complex mental life. Forel went so far as to maintain that their behavior involves memory, associations of sensory images, perceptions, attention, habit formation, and simple powers of inference from analogy. The attempt of Loeb and other mech- anists to restrict consciousness to the higher animals on the basis of ability to form associations was brought to naught by experimental results indicating that many, if not all, of the lower organisms have such capacity to some degree. The early work of Jennings, Pieron, Yerkes and others had clearly shown this fact. Furthermore, many writers, including Romanes, Lubbock and Morgan, had pointed out the logical fallacy of denying consciousness to organisms that do not meet an arbitrary criterion of this sort. The basic assumption of Loeb, that tropistic, instinctive, and unlearned responses in general are wholly uncon- scious, and hence that consciousness is coextensive with acquired, or intelligent behavior, was called in question on all</page><page sequence="30">DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY 509 sides. Both contemporary and later psy- chologists and biologists usually assign some sort of awarcness to the more com- plex instincts, even though denying the presence of a conscious, guiding purpose. Romanes, for example, defines instinct as "reflex action into which there has been imported the element of consciousness." The ability to profit by experience was to him positive evidence of consciousness in the sense of a guiding factor. Morgan held much the same view. The ability to profit by experience was maintained by him to be the criterion of effective con- sciousness, but he argued that for all we know, even the growth changes taking place "in the duly fertilized egg" may involve sentience, or a dim awareness. It is clear, then, that Loeb had done nothing more than take over the criterion of Romanes and make a fallacious application of it by denying consciousness outright where positive evidence of a conscious guiding factor was not forthcoming. In any case, ability to learn ceased to be of value as a criterion of consciousness as soon as modifiability of behavior in the protista had been definitely demonstrated. The search for other criteria of con- sciousness, and of different psychic levels in infra-human forms proved to be hardly more successful. No one seemed to appre- ciate the seriousness of the difficulties involved. The fact that the introspec- tively derived levels of human mental life were arbitrary and based upon philo- sophical prejudices insofar as they were clearly defined at all was generally over- looked. Lubbock, indeed, had urged that the chief obstacle to the use of anthropo- morphic analogy lay in the almost utter lack of definite correlations between men- tal states and bodily behavior factors in the human field. However, occasional criticisms of such a fundatnental sort were incffectual. The application of the canon of Morgan presupposes a fairly definite hierarchy of human mental processes and the possibility of recognizing correspond. ing levels in animals. This canon was held by many to place an undue restriction upon subjective interpretation and nothing would establish it so securely as to work out a hierarchy of mental levels that would make it a workable instrument. It is not surprising, therefore, that interest gradually shifted from the problem of determining a criterion of consciousness in animals to speculations concerning criteria of infra-human psychic levels. Morgan himself posited three mental levels as follows: (i) sentience, a dim awareness or vague feeling state, probably possessed by all organisms, (2.) effective consciousness, indicated by the ability to profit by experience which supposedly involves conscious guidance, and (3) self-consciousness, associated with highly analytical or rational processes, such as presuppose genuine language ability and therefore probably limited to man. Since he grants that all organisms are prob- ably sentient, and insists that man alone is self-conscious in his sense, the task reduces to that of deciding what or- ganisms meet the test of the second level. And here a structural criterion is brought in also, since Morgan seems to feel that this level requires a central nervous system and brain of some complexity (I79). However, it is obvious that the distinction between the first and second level, like the criterion of Loeb, becomes meaningless insofar as evidence is forth- coming that the ability to profit by experience is common to all organisms. Several other attempts were made to arrange hierarchies of psychic develop- ment for use in comparative psychology. Hachet-Souplet (I36) proposed a classifica- tion based upon the training methods (methode de dressage) to which an animal</page><page sequence="31">5IO THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY may be responsive. The protozoa show only the psychic attribute of excitability and cannot be trained at all; certain other animals ranging from Coelenterates to mammalian forms possess primitive in- stincts and functional memory and are subject to coercive training; a few of the higher animals possess genuine memory and intelligence and are amenable to persuasion. Schneider (zo5) held the view that consciousness exhibits itself in six progressive stages as follows, the first three stages only being applicable to infra- human organisms: ether, material, sense. quality, form, potency, and will. Kirk- patrick (i5i) proposed "organosis" as a common term covering both the neural and psychic factors, and recognizes four progressive types of organosis-vegetative, sensory-motor, representative and abstract thinking. Lukas (i68) suggested that the criteria of consciousness be grouped under three general heads as follows, (i) morphological, including structural aspects of brain and sense-organs, (2) physiological, with emphasis upon evi- dences of individual purposiveness and the ideomotor factor in behavior, (3) teleological, covering the significance of various stimuli for the organism. Finally Yerkes (-52) has analyzed mental activity into three levels-discriminative, intelli- gent, and rational-corresponding roughly to those of Morgan. He does not, like Morgan, limit the highest level to man, but agrees with Morgan that the lowest level is probably common to all animal forms. The most systematic set of criteria offered as a basis for determining the psychic level of organisms was the follow- ing, devised by Yerkes (7zr): 1. Structural criteria I. General form of organism (Organization) 2.. Nervous system (Neural-organization) 3. Specialization in the nervous system (Neural- specialization) IL. Fenctional criteria x. General form of reaction (Discrimination) .. Modifiability of reaction (Docility) 3. Variableness of reaction (Initiative) The above criteria are given in the general order of increasing importance, as diagnostic signs of psychic life, functional signs being of more impor- tance than structural, and the particular sign within each group of more value than the general, although as Yerkes admits, this may not hold in every in- stance. In illustrating the application of the criteria, Yerkes examines the evidence for the sea-anemone and concludes that it shows no certain signs of either intelli- gent or rational consciousness, and prob- ably possesses a psychic life on the lowest level, the discriminative. He questions whether it is not reasonable to suppose, on the basis of such criteria, that the ant "possesses a form of consciousness which is comparable in complexity of aspect and change with the human." Curiously enough, many years before Lubbock (i66) had stated the case for the ant in much the same language without a definite set of criteria to guide him. No one appeared to question the rele- vancy and usefulness of the concept of psychic levels as thus employed in com- parative psychology. The point was quite generally overlooked that little or nothing would be gained by the mere classification of organisms into two or three rough groups of the types suggested, even if the validity of the criteria em- ployed were granted. The subjectivists did not seem to realize that their first and foremost problem was to make an analysis of the animal consciousness, by the method of analogy, along the lines of human introspective psychology. Nor did it seem to occur to them that, to be at all adequate, such an analysis must reveal to us in terms of our own experi- ence how it actually feels to be this, that,</page><page sequence="32">DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY jiI or the other animal in various typical situations. Naturally this would mean a comparison of the qualitative aspects of characteristic elementary and complex mental states of animal and man. The arrangement of organisms into a psycho- phylogenetic tree on the basis of their general psychic level should follow rather than precede a thoroughgoing analysis of their actual inner conscious experience. The principle of psychic levels as com- monly employed was, in reality, only a substitute for such an analysis of experi- ence, although often pretending to repre- sent genuine psychological analysis. Even those who contended that the primary purpose of comparative psychol- ogy was to secure a picture of the subjec- tive life of infra-human forms were exceedingly cautious about hazarding an opinion regarding the qualitative aspects of animal consciousness. After spending a lifetime in the study of insects, Lubbock hesitates to do more than make a few shrewd guesses concerning their general mental level. He lays down the principle that we can know nothing whatsoever concerning the experience of animals, qua experience. Morgan, Wundt, Titch- ener, and most other later writers agree with him that even the quality of a simple sensation or feeling cannot be translated into terms of human conscious- ness, and hence must remain forever shrouded in mystery. But this is pre- cisely the first and fundamental task of a subjectivecomparativepsychology. How, indeed, can anthropomorphic analogy be successfully employed in revealing the more complex mental life of animals, if inferences regarding the qualitative aspects of the simplest mental states are admit- edly impossible? The opinion of Lubbock that the protozoan possesses most probably a vague, confused consciousness, and that of Morgan and Thorndike that the mental life of the higher vertebrates is unan- alytical and devoid of free ideas, represent, even if true, logical deduction rather than psychological analysis. Among the few attempts to portray the actual feelings of the animal in human terms, that of Thorn- dike (2.iz, page 123) will serve as a fair example. He compares the characteristic consciousness of the cat or dog to that of the human being while in swimming, when "one feels sense-impressions, has impulses, feels the movements he makes; that is all." Morgan "cordially endorses" this interpretation, although Thorndike is careful to say that it may be only a fancy. It was inevitable, although extremely unfortunate, that the speculative spirit should have held so dominant a place in the earlier decades of the period, hindering as it did the normal progress of compara- tive psychology along naturalistic lines. The real difficulty lay in the fact that the Cartesian conception of mind as an entity was widely prevalent. This carried with it the idea that at some point in the phylogenetic scale the psychic factor as something sui generis had made its appear- ance. The whole matter had been dis- posed of by Descartes by sweeping aside with a grand gesture the notion of con- scious life in all organisms below man. In denying consciousness to lower organisms only, Loeb, Bethe, and other extreme mechanists were faced with the problem of the origin and appearance of conscious- ness, and the mode of its operation in the higher animals. The view of Morgan and the later conservatives that life and mind in some sense are probably coexten- sive avoided the question as to the first appearance of consciousness, but substi- tuted the equally ubiquitous one con- cerning the psychical level of various or- ganisms. As we have seen, no one had</page><page sequence="33">5IX THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY brought forward criteria of consciousness, or of psychical levels that were either logically satisfactory or of any genuine value in the practical task of arranging organisms in a mental scale. More important still, no one had made a serious attempt to reveal the subjective experience of the animal mind in terms of the analyt- ical concepts of human consciousness. In view of the evident failure of the defenders of subjectivism in comparative psychology to offer a constructive working program, it does not seem strange that the validity and usefulness of anthropo- morphic analogy began to be attacked. The vigorous and rapid extension of experimental methods that marked the turn of the century had the effect of shifting the emphasis from speculation to objective results. The experimentalists became more and more interested in ob- serving and reporting behavior and had less time and inclination than formerly to indulge in subjective speculation. They were, indeed, often embarrassed by the claim that their work was not genuinely psychological insofar as they failed to make a deliberate subjective interpretation of their results. When the experimen- talist did stop to theorize, he was likely to do so in a more critical vein than formerly. For example, Thorndike, on the basis of his own studies, vigorously attacked imitational and ideational types of learning in higher vertebrates and emphasized, even more than Morgan had done, the trial and error factor. Even in the field of human psychology, the older subjective concepts and the introspective method were beginning to be challenged. In I904, James (I48) led out with his famous attack on the concept of consciousness as an entity, and Cattell (iI6) asserted the right of the psychol- ogist to deal with purely objective phases of human behavior without recourse to introspective or other subjec- tive interpretation. Somewhat earlier than this, Woodworth (246) had shown the inadequacy of introspective analysis in connection with his study of voluntary movement. A decade later, Dunlap (I24, 235) emphasized the shortcomings of introspection and argued against the current conception of the mental image. In philosophy, the American wing of the pragmatic movement, and more par- ticularly the development of American realism (244, 245), had led to a demand for a reformulation of psychological concep- tions, more in line with a functional, or relational view of mind. In Russia, Bekhterev (94) was contending for a strictly objective human psychology al- though not denying the existence of mental states paralleling behavior, stress- ing rather the irrelevancy of subjectivc description. In spite of such occasional evidences of revolt, however, human psychology was still dominated by subjec- tivism, as a survey of the opinions of representative leaders will show (i16, 22.2) Thus matters stood, when Watson, beginning about i9i2, proposed that psychology throw overboard the intro- spective method and all subjective con- cepts and limit its activities to the study of objective factors in terms of stimulus- response relationships. Watson denied that the psychologist, as scientist, had any right to recognize such philosophical distinctions as mind-body, subjective- objective, conscious-unconscious. To the empirical observer there exists only the organism as an object and its movements or behavior in an environment. Such subjective categories as sensation, emo- tion, image, etc., as currently conceived, are logical artefacts rather than psycholog- ical entities or processes. Nothing of the sort can be discovered by natural</page><page sequence="34">DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY 5I3 science methods. Such terms are mean- ingless to the scientist, therefore, how- ever valuable they may be to the philos- opher. The living organism presents no mind-body dichotomy to the biological observer but is, for him, a unitary object in the same sense that a crystal or other inorganic body is such for the physical scientist. Speculative analysis and inter- pretation, insofar as they are justified at all, belong to the philosopher; the psychologist must use a descriptive ter- minology that properly belongs to the scientific universe of discourse. He can- not juggle into his system subjective categories about which natural science in the nature of the case can know nothing. We are not here directly concerned with the specific application of the objective view of Watson to human psychology. However, it may be remarked that insofar as the proper use of anthropomorphic analogy is dependent upon a well- grounded analysis of human consciousness, the behavioristic issue in human psy- chology is of vital importance to infra- human psychology. Moreover, the dis- tinction at this point is not, strictly speaking, between animal and man but between that part of human psychology in which introspection is possible and the remainder of the field, both animal and human. As Morgan (I76) early pointed out, the mental life of the human infant, and certain types of the subnormal and insane can be approached only by the method of analogy applied precisely as in the animal field. From the organismic principle underlying the behavioristic position it would follow that only such data on the normal adult human as can be obtained by objective methods properly belong in a comparative psychology broad enough to include the human species. The view of Watson and of other leading behaviorists (I59, 2.38) is that the entire range of human experience may be formulated in objective terms and exhaus- tively investigated when appropriate natural science methods have been developed. The success of the objective movement in the infra-human field meant the over- throw of the principle of anthropo- morphic analogy. The special dangers involved in the method of analogy had been emphasized by Lubbock, Morgan, Wundt, and many other writers who, in general, defended its use. In his earliest phase, Verworn had stated the obvious logical principle that the greater the similarity between an organism and man the greater the validity of inferences re- garding the psychic life of the former. He appears to have been the first to make use of the now familiar formula:X:A::C:B, in which the first two terms represent the infra-human and human mental states respectively, and the last two terms the corresponding bodily and behavior charac- teristics. In criticising Verworn's fortn- ula, Norman (i8i) has shown how utterly unreliable it may be when applied to specific cases. The logical implications of the method of analogy were most lucidly and comprehensively treated by Morgan it the first chapter of his Introdsction, in which he also lays down the canon which bears his name. Morgan here stresses the fact that a subjective human psychology is dependent upon ego-centric analogy in much the same way as a subjective animal psychology is dependent upon anthropo- morphic analogy, and offers the only escape from the predicament of solipsism. The behaviorists accepted the reasoning of Morgan, but rejected both types of analogy as being not only fallacious but unnecessary. The leading subjectivists were agreed that analogy, unless applied with extreme caution, was likely to be dangerously speculative, whereas Watson</page><page sequence="35">I4 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY and the behaviorists went the logical limit by holding that the speculative element was so large as to render all inferences of this sort misleading, and scientifically worthless. The objective principle as applying to the infra-human field, has come to be more and more accepted, and at present, repre- sents the dominant tendency in compara- tive psychology. Although the validity of analogy is insisted upon by some writers (z.5, 223) they make little or no use of it. It is generally agreed that the qualitative aspects of the animal con- sciousness cannot be inferred from struc- ture or behavior. But this, as we have seen, is tantamount to giving up the primary task of the subjective method and carries with it the implication that a subjective comparative psychology is quite impossible. In view of the strength and vigor of the objective movement, it seems fair to conclude that the science has definitely adopted a strictly biological viewpoint and a natural science method- ology. Its major categories-organism, environment, and response, or behavior- are broadly naturalistic, and avoid the older mind-body dichotomy with its attendant speculations. The proper goal of this objective comparative psychology is the determination of the conditions and laws of stimulation-response process, involved in the continuous interaction between the organism and its environ- ment. Having freed itself from the dominating influence of human psychology insofar as subjective interpretation is concerned, comparative psychology no longer need be bound by the older anthropocentric attitude as to its legitimate purposes and program. Indeed, it gives some promise of discarding the narrow view that it exists as a mere adjunct to human psy- chology and that its primary aim should be to make discoveries that may throw light upon the mental processes or be- havior of the human species. Even so conservative a writer as Wundt (z47) recognized the right of comparative psy- chology to develop a content independent of human reference in the same sense as zoology is independent of human mor- phology and physiology. This broader view would seek to find intrinsic interest in the behavior of each organism studied, including man, and in all possible inter- comparisons of such behavior. The dif- ferences in behavior between ameba and earthworm may very well be of more interest and importance in the systematic development of the science than behavior differences between chimpanzee and man. Just as morphology and physiology in their comparative aspect include the entire range of structural and functional differentiation in living organisms, so comparative psychology should seek to study the multitudinous modes of adjust- ment of these same organisms to their larger environment.
