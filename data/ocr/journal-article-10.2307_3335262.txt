The items came from museums and private collections in the Netherlands, Belgium, England, France and Germany, and most of them had never been shown in public. The exhi- bition was the first major show, at least in Europe, to concentrate on the astonish- ing Ogboni objects and offered first of all an impression of the variety, liveliness and beauty of the Ogboni bronzes. We still know very little of the Ogboni rites and symbolism, and for that reason it was impossible to arrange the objects in accordance with these categories. In the present state of our knowledge the most prudent alternative was to make a morphological division of the material: a large section of edan in their different forms, both spiked and free-standing; the Onile statues; the horseman figures; the rattles, bracelets and title-staffs, mostly in brass; and the wooden objects such as drums, a door and a bull-roarer. The best known and most typical Ogboni object is undoubtedly the pair of anthropomorphic brass staffs or figures known as edan. The exhibition shows that the same workshops produced both spiked and free-standing varieties and also used an alloy of lead-tin-zinc as well as brass. Perhaps the objects (not only edan but also masks and bracelets) in this alloy were made for the followers of Obatala, who might also have ordered the hunch- backed edan. The free-standing edan is not limited to the well-known full figures of a man and a woman, but-like the spiked ones-can take the form of a single head or of two figures one on top of the other (the so-called ikuku oro), although these last two versions of the free-standing edan seem to be extremely rare. X-ray photographs of the free-standing edan prove that in their core a small piece of iron is hidden, which-unlike the iron pin in the spiked version-has no techni- cal function. Even a sword blade only a few millimeters thick contains a very small piece of iron. This might indicate that in Ogboni thought, the well-known female symbolism of earth is doubled by the male symbolism of iron, linked with Ogun and the blacksmith. The apparent importance of iron in Ogboni symbolism was another reason for including title-staffs of the blacksmiths (iwana ogun) and ceremonial swords for the god of iron (ada ogun) in the exhibition, although their icono- graphical resemblance to the other Ogboni material would have been enough to justify their presence. The opportunity for comparison in such a broad survey of Ogboni pieces widens the possibility of localizing certain styles and even indi- vidual masters. Two pairs of edan shown in the exhibition were photographed in situ in Nigeria by William Fagg in 1950. One comes from Ijebu Ife; the other was said to have been brought from Old Oyo. A curious feature of the latter pair is that the breasts of the female figure are hol- lowed out from the back. Two other pairs and two single figures from the same master or workshop were on display. ,, i EARTH-MOTHER FIGURE, ONILE. 40cm. STOLPER GALLERIES, MUNICH. FREESTANDING OGBONI EDAN. 22cm. PRIVATE COLLECTION. 75</page><page sequence="2">A 260-page exhibition catalogue with more than 160 photographs and a text (in Dutch) written by the well-known Ogboni specialist Dr. Th. Dobbelmann is avail- able by mail from the Afrika Museum, Postweg 6, Berg en Dal, Netherlands, at 27.50 guilders plus postage. Dr. Dob- belmann has summarized all present information on the religious and political functions of the Ogboni society and the technical and symbolic aspects of its iconography. A German version of the catalogue is in preparation. The exposition remained at the Afrika Museum in Berg en Dal until the first of August of this year. From September until December it will be shown in the Rauten- strauch-Joest-Museum in Cologne. Hans Witte Afrika Museum WEA VING, TEXTILES &amp; COSTUMES FROM WEST AFRICA Africana Museum Cuttington University College Suakoko, Liberia May 1-July 24, 1976 In its most recent exhibition, the Afri- cana Museum at Cuttington University College featured a sampling of West Afri- can textiles and costumes. The majority of the exhibition was assembled from the museum's permanent collection and a few pieces were on loan from the private collections of faculty members. MEN'S WEAVE. MENDE, SIERRA LEONE. Among the costumes displayed, all of which originated from Liberia or its im- mediate surrounding areas, the two which attracted the most attention were loma costumes from the museum collection. The first is a gown and headdress made from the feathers of the guinea fowl and the "blue wing" and is purported to have been worn by a messenger for the Poro society; the second is a magnificent gown and headdress of leopard skin and red cloth patchwork with elaborate leather trimming. The headdress, which is hung with eagle's talons and amulets, adds to the visual power of the costume. It is said to be either a war gown or a costume worn by a high official of the Poro society. The focus of the exhibition, however, was on textiles, and the show featured a variety of examples from Liberia, Ivory Coast, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Mali and Nigeria.

Exhibits were also set up displaying the various imple- ments used by strip-loom weavers in West Africa, and those implements that are needed to hand-spin raw cotton into the thread used in much of the traditionally woven cloth. Along with the more tradi- tional textiles made with indigenous materials and methods were featured examples of contemporary tied and dyed and wax print cloth such as that being cur- rently produced in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Several pieces with brilliant color and extremely varied designs were repre- sentative of techniques using imported dyes and cloth. The growing popularity of imported materials was also illustrated by several pieces woven in the traditional manner but using colorful imported threads instead of the traditional hand- spun and dyed thread. The obvious creativity and beauty in- herent in these textiles and costumes most assuredly illustrate the talents of West African weavers and dyers. One of the aims of this exhibition was to encourage an awareness of the importance of this artistic tradition and to stimulate its continuation and preservation. It is hoped that this show succeeded in contributing something to that effort. Despite its somewhat isolated location in the heart of Liberia, the Africana Museum was pleased to welcome, besides the students, faculty and staff of the uni- versity, many appreciative visitors and friends who saw the exhibition. During the last week of July a major portion of the show was carried to Monrovia and re- assembled in the United States Infor- mation Service (USIS) building where it received a good deal more publicity and exposure.
