<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology in Cyprus ELLEN HERSCHER During the three years since the last report on cur- rent archaeological research in Cyprus appeared in AJA,' Cypriot archaeology has continued to exhibit growth and vitality (fig. 1).2 New projects have com- menced, old ones are being published, and numer- ous lively colloquia addressing a wide variety of Cypriot-related topics have been held in North Amer- ica and Europe as well as in Cyprus. Many younger scholars are beginning to make substantial contri- butions to the field.3 Some little-explored parts of the island are receiving more systematic attention. Various methodologies and theoretical approaches coexist in a (usually) creative state of tension. Yet the current status has a less promising side as well. The archaeological resource base of the is- land continues to be shadowed by the two-pronged threat of uncontrolled tourism and economic devel- opment. Buses of tourists descend upon the Paphos mosaics and Tombs of the Kings, and the construc- tion of hotels, restaurants, and parking lots to ac- commodate them destroys other, yet unexplored, parts of ancient Paphos. An increasing amount of the Department of Antiquities staff's time and bud- get is being used for "rescue" excavations, and more and more museum storage space is being used to house the resulting finds-which no one may ever have time to study. Setting aside archaeologically im- portant areas for future study has become more difficult too: in May 1997, landowners around ancient Amathus protested that their compensation for ex- propriated land was inadequate, since touristic de- velopment in the area had caused land values to escalate. Voices from many sectors of the Cypriot community are being raised, calling for a more rational approach to growth, but as other Mediter- ranean countries have already discovered, the pro- cess is hard to stop.4 The present survey focuses upon the 1994-1996 field seasons, although in a few cases it has also been possible to include results from work in 1997. In all, it is important to emphasize the preliminary nature of the interpretations presented here, and once again, to thank the field directors for allowing their results to be included. INSTITUTIONS The Department of Antiquities of the Republic of Cyprus5 has responded heroically to the de- I Publication of this newsletter was made possible in part by a generous subvention from an anonymous donor. I am extremely grateful for the outstanding coopera- tion of colleagues directing field projects in Cyprus, who have generously responded to my request for information; many have also personally conducted me around their sites. Those of us from other countries have enjoyed for many years the gracious hospitality of the Department of Anti- quities of the Republic of Cyprus, for which we express our continual appreciation. Director of the Department during the period reviewed in this report was Demos Chris- tou, to whom we send our best wishes for an enjoyable retirement. I would like to thank Diana Buitron-Oliver, Annemarie Weyl Carr, Andrew Oliver, Nancy Serwint, Joanna Smith, Stuart Swiny, and Hassan Tekel for various kinds of assis- tance during the preparation of this article; my sincere thanks as well to Tracey Cullen and Fred Kleiner for their patience and support.

The number of archaeologists employed in the De- partment has increased somewhat during the past three years, but total staffing is still small compared to similar territories such as Rhodes or Crete. The Director of the Department since 1992, Demos Chris- tou, retired at the end of 1997; he has been succeeded by Sophocles Hadjisavvas. After many years of planning, the Department has launched a major initiative to protect several of the most visited ancient sites while upgrading the sur- rounding environment as an integrated tourist area and improving the sites' presentation and interpre- tation. Master plans for Kato Paphos, Kourion, Khir- okitia, and Kouklia have been completed, and the implementation of the ambitious plan for Paphos began in 1995.6 An "archaeological park" will en- compass the Frankish castle of Saranda Kolones, the Roman mosaics (including the Houses of Dionysos, Theseus, and Orpheus), the church of Ayia Kyriaki (site of"St. Paul's Pillar"), and will include a visitors' center and an exhibition hall. The Department has continued to further its pol- icy of decentralizing the exhibition of antiquities in order to keep finds in district museums close to the area of their discovery, and to help decentralize tourism as well. A long-anticipated site museum at Maa Paleokastro has now opened,7 and a district Marion-Arsinoe Museum at Polis Chrysochous is under construction. Future plans call for museums at ancient Idalion and Amathus (infra). Amathus will also soon be formally opened to visitors (i.e., fenced and entered by ticket only during certain hours). Opening to the public is also anticipated in 1998 for the aceramic Neolithic site of Kalavasos Tenta, excavated in 1976-1984 by Ian Todd of the Vasilikos Valley Project.8 A protective roof erected over the site in 1994-1995 is already attracting startled atten- tion from traffic on the nearby Nicosia-Limassol high- way (fig. 2). The tentlike structure, 16 m high, is formed by a frame of 14 vertical wooden beams ris- ing from concrete bedding and joined at the top by a metal ring, the frame then covered by a skin of yellow polyvinyl chloride. An interior walkway is sus- pended from the beams to allow visitors to view the site from above; it also provides an excellent view 6 Hadjisavvas (supra n. 4); for Khirokitia, see infra. 7 A.

The innovative structure was designed by Martin Schmid of the French School of Archaeology at Athens, constructed by local en- gineering companies, and paid for by the Depart- ment of Antiquities and the A.G. Leventis Founda- tion (infra). In 1996 the Archaeological Research Unit (ARU) of the University of Cyprus9 became part of a new Department of History and Archaeology, chaired by Demetrios Michaelides. Since the retirement of Vas- sos Karageorghis in 1996, Michaelides is also serv- ing as Acting Director of the ARU, which includes four faculty in addition to himself. The ARU con- tinues to sponsor and cosponsor lectures and sym- posia on various archaeological topics. The Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute (CAARI), the only foreign archaeological institution in Cyprus,1' is now under the direction of Nancy Serwint, following the departure of Stuart Swiny (director 1980-1995). Its hostel facility oper- ates year-round at near capacity and its study collec- tions and ever-expanding library are actively used by residents and researchers from 20 or more coun- tries annually. CAARI sponsors lectures on an eclec- tic range of topics, informal seminars, roundtables, and field trips, publishes a newsletter, and provides several fellowships." Its 15th annual archaeological symposium, featuring field reports of current exca- vations, was held in the summer of 1997. A special event on the occasion of Nicosia's celebration as the Cultural Capital of Europe (October 1995) included a public exhibition and craft demonstrations. The second CAARI-sponsored excavation is currently in progress (at Kourion, infra) and the first volume of a new CAARI monograph series (the proceed- ings of the symposium "Res Maritimae," infra) has appeared. Cyprus's most distinguished archaeologist, Vas- sos Karageorghis, now heads the Anastasios G. Le- ventis Foundation, the Cyprus branch of the A.G. Leventis Foundation. The foundation has for several years been playing an active role in Cyprus and abroad in the preservation and protection of ancient sites and monuments. Activities have included pub- lications, conservation projects, museums, archae- ological excavations, and the repatriation of antiq- uities.12 The foundation has recently restored, and installed its headquarters in, a fine early 20th-century Neoclassical house in central Nicosia. Another private institution of increasing impor- tance to Cypriot archaeology is the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation, established in 1987. It exhibits some of its important numismatic collection in a gallery (Museum of the History of Cypriot Coinage) in the bank's administration building, and also owns the largest collection of Cypriot maps. In addition, the foundation sponsors lectures, provides support for colloquia on archaeological topics, and is pub- lishing an excellent series of guidebooks to major archaeological sites.13 It is hoped that this level of activity will continue, now that the foundation's out- standing director since its inception, Maria Iacovou, has joined the faculty of the ARU at the University. BIBLIOGRAPHY Annual summaries of excavations and major ac- quisitions of Cypriot museums, written by the Di- rector of the Department of Antiquities, continue to appear in the Bulletin de correspondance hellenique (BCH) and the Annual Report of the Director of the De- partment of Antiquities, Republic of Cyprus (AnnRep- Cypr).14 The Report of the Department of Antiquities, Cy- prus (RDAC) is published annually with a wide range of specialist studies and reports on current fieldwork.

Directed at a more popular audience, but still of sound scholarship and providing excellent color photographs of sites and artifacts, is a volume on Cyprus in the Dossiers d'archeologie series.19 Archae- ologists interested in the history of the field will en- joy a colorful portrait of the participants in the pi- oneering Swedish Cyprus Expedition.20 The organizers of colloquia and symposia on Cy- prus are remarkable for their record of prompt pub- lication of the proceedings of their conferences. Sev- eral of those appearing during the past three years have focused on general topics related to Cyprus's distinctive position as an island interposed among major eastern Mediterranean routes of transit.21 More specialized, but still concerned with Cypriot antiquity from the aceramic Neolithic through Late Roman times, is a comprehensive overview of stone sculpture on the island.22 Three recent volumes have been published in honor of scholars of major importance to Cypriot studies. While not devoted exclusively to Cyprus, each Festschrift includes the honoree's bibliography and several valuable contributions related to the island's archaeology.23 CURRENT FIELDWORK As mentioned above, rescue archaeology is now widespread in Cyprus.24 Particularly affected are the environs of Paphos, Limassol, and Nicosia- now ex- tending southward nearly to ancient Tamassos, where 16 E.g., C.

Particularly thought-provoking- even from the archaeological perspective - is the contribution of A. Shehzad Zaidi, "From Order to Chaos and Back: The Cypriot Voyage in Othello and El Amante Liberal" (pp. 135-41), which concludes: "Cyprus is the graveyard of memory, the domain of uncertainty where the refinements of civiliza- tion are eclipsed by primal urges.

A hasty salvage excavation by the Department of Antiquities recov- ered several hundred funerary urns with lids, which had been placed in rows in several layers. With them were the cremated remains of infants mixed with animal bones and small objects. The loss of full con- textual information for this unique site is a tragedy for archaeology. The modern capital city of Nicosia is believed to be located on the site of the ancient city-kingdom of Ledra, but because of continuous occupation in the area, ancient Nicosia is very poorly known. Over the years, intermittent rescue excavations of tombs of all periods have been carried out in various sec- tors as the modern city expanded: best known is the rich Bronze Age cemetery of Ayia Paraskevi, in the area of the Cyprus Hilton.30 Because of this almost total lack of evidence for ancient settlement in Nicosia, the recent excavations on Pasydy hill in the central part of the city, not far from the Pedeios River, assume great importance. The site, opposite CAARI and one of the few exten- sive, centrally located plots not already covered with modern high-rises, is destined for the imminent con- struction of the new House of Representatives build- ing. Excavations by the Department of Antiquities have found a bothros and a series of superimposed buildings going back to the fifth century B.C. or pos- sibly earlier. A Hellenistic structure was among those identified, which may be linked to a "monumental" Hellenistic building found nearby in 1955, under what is now a gas station. Another interesting accidental discovery is a sanc- tuary of Baal-Hammon, identified during road wid- ening in the rapidly developing area south of Nico- sia.31 The finds recovered include a headless cult statue, and additional sculpture of the Cypro- Classical, Roman, and Early Christian periods (when the shrine was converted into a church). According to reports from the Turkish-controlled northern part of Cyprus, a small amount of rescue excavation is apparently the only archaeology being carried out there.32 The most important discovery that has become publicly known is a "royal" tomb, dated to Cypro-Archaic II, found accidently at Sala- mis in 1994. It is located about 300 m north of the monastery of St. Barnabas and 700 m from the well- known necropolis excavated by Karageorghis.33 The tomb has a stepped dromos in which an equid (prob- ably an ass) was buried; other finds include a set of firedogs and amphoras of Phoenician type.

Systematic fieldwork in Cyprus continues to be broadly international in scope, with approximately 27 foreign expeditions joining seven ongoing pro- jects of the Department of Antiquities.34 Several of the large-scale survey projects are now directing more attention toward selective excavation, generally with useful results, but perhaps an unfortunate trend in view of the rapid destruction of sites. SURVEYS Sydney Cyprus Survey Project. The Sydney Cyprus Survey Project (SCSP) under the direction of A. Ber- nard Knapp, University of Glasgow, is continuing its exploration of the copper-rich area between the mod- ern villages of Politiko and Mitsero, in the north- central foothills of the Troodos Mountains.35 The project has now identified approximately 60 sites within the 59 km2 survey zone. Analysis of the ce- ramics suggests that the area experienced intense occupation during the late Cypro-Archaic to Helle- nistic periods, in late antiquity (fifth to seventh cen- turies A.D.), and again in the Ottoman period (16th- 19th centuries). Evidence for Bronze Age settlement remains scant. The most recent seasons have focused on sites of particular interest and initiated a limited program of excavation. Two major slag heaps, at Mitsero Kou- loupakhis and Mitsero Sykamies, were sectioned in or- der to examine their composition and history. At Kou- loupakhis, a structure was observed imbedded in the slag, along with well-defined stratified workshop floors and furnace fragments. Both slag heaps pro- duced pottery from the Iron Age to the Late Roman period, seeming to contradict the usual assumption that the copper mines were closed down by the fourth century A.D. More extensive excavations were begun at Politiko Phorades in 1997, a site along a creek bed 3 km south- west of the village of Politiko and about 500 m from the nearest copper mineral deposit, at Kokkinorotsos. So far the site has produced considerable slag of a type previously unknown in Cyprus, a large quan- tity of furnace lining fragments (sufficient to allow partial reconstruction of the shape of the furnaces), and 20 almost complete tuybres of different types. The earliest surface pottery in the area is Cypro- Geometric III-Cypro-Archaic I, as was that from the excavated surface layers. Sherds from the layers with archaeometallurgical material date to very early in the Late Bronze Age, but they are not necessarily in situ and may have been deposited by water from the creek. If Politiko Phorades proves to date to Late Cypriot I, it would be the earliest primary smelting site yet found in Cyprus. Maroni Valley Archaeological Survey Project. The Maroni Valley Archaeological Survey Project, under the direction of Sturt W. Manning (University of Reading),36 has been less active in the field in recent years as project personnel have directed efforts toward excavation.37 In 1996 the survey discovered an exposed Late Roman kiln at Zygi Petrini, which it cleaned and recorded. Sia-Mathiatis-Agia Varvara Survey Project. The Swiss project under the direction of Walter Fasnacht, having completed excavation at the copper produc- tion site of Ayia VarvaraAlmyras (infra), in 1995 began an archaeometallurgical survey in the Sha River val- ley in the region of the modern Sha and Mathiatis mines.38 The aim of this project (SMASP) is to place Almyras in a broader context of the local history of copper production. Interviews with mine workers from the village of Alambra have provided an ad- ditional ethnographic component to the project. In the area of the modern South Mathiati Mine, an unusual piece of furnace lining with an attached portion of a tuyere fragment was found on the sur- face. The furnace wall fragment appears to be part of a removable plug that fit into a prefabricated hole 4 Herscher 260. 5 Herscher 264. Several additional preliminary reports have been published: A.B.

In the same area the project identified a copper-smelting site with two well-preserved fur- naces cut into the bedrock (fig. 3), two anvils for crush- ing, and quantities of slag. The single radiocarbon date available from charcoal in the furnace places it in Cypro-Archaic II, the same date as the earliest period at Almyras. Members of SMASP also found several slag con- centrations in an area north of the Sha-Mathiati road. The largest of them, almost 100 m in diameter, is Sha Anoyia, which was investigated in more detail (fig. 4). The slags found here are different from those at Almyras and South Mathiati, and the size of the concentration is much larger than at either one. The single available radiocarbon date suggests 350-200 B.C. for metallurgical activity at this site. Polis-Pyrgos Archaeological Project. Dariusz Mal- iszewski has for several years been carrying out the Polis-Pyrgos Archaeological Project, a limited sur- vey in a large area of northwestern Cyprus, bounded approximately by Cape Drepanon on the southwest and on the northeast by the village of Kato Pyrgos at the western edge of Morphou Bay.39 This part of Cyprus remains poorly known archaeologically, espe- cially the region east of the town of Polis. Work to date has focused on the area around the villages of Kato Pyrgos, Yialia, and Sarama, the Ayios Theodoros River valley, and the region between Polis and the village of Magounda. Several dozen previously un- recorded sites have been located, with significant Fig. 4. Sha Anoyia. Classical-Hellenistic (?) copper-smelting site. 39 For preliminary reports, see D.

Most exciting is the fact that the ongoing, long-term French excavations at Khirokitia- the type site for the period and one of the best-known sites in the Middle East- continue to contribute to the evolving interpretations of the period in the wake of the un- precedented discoveries at new sites such as Parek- klisha Shillourokambos. Work at ceramic Neolithic sites too is contributing significantly to a much more com- plex characterization of this period. Although published results of the excavations at Akrotiri Aetokremnos41 are still preliminary, the inter- pretation and significance of the site continue to evoke heated discussion.42 Until full publication of the project's data, however, there appears to be little basis for challenging the initial conclusions of the excavator. Two publications relating to the early periods should be noted. A valuable resource is a compre- hensive compilation of the known Pleistocene sites in Cyprus, gathered from widely scattered and difficult to access sources, with a summary of the evidence.4 Eagerly anticipated is the final report of the important multiphase early prehistoric site of Kissonerga Mosphilia in western Cyprus, excavated by Edgar Peltenburg.44 Khirokitia Vouni.45 Alain Le Brun, under the aus- pices of the Centre national de la recherche scien- tifique (CNRS), has continued his investigations and timely publication of the major aceramic Neolithic site of Khirokitia.46 Excavations during 1994-1996 have focused on the eastern, most ancient, part of the site and on the western access to the town. Investigations in the eastern sector are intended to reveal the organization of the settlement from the time of its founding around 7000 B.C., and to clarify the sequence of construction and usage of the build- ings. The pattern varies widely, some having been occupied for lengthy periods and others only briefly. A sophisticated bedding technique, composed of two layers of stones covered by pise, is attested begin- ning in the earliest levels. Excavation of one struc- ture, S.140, exposed an architectural arrangement in which the two internal piers of the building are joined to the outer walls.47 This feature is known at the nearby site of Kalavasos Tenta, but was not pre- viously attested at Khirokitia. A stone human figur- ine was found lying on the floor of this building. Twelve infant burials were found beneath a single house occupied during the last phase of the acer- amic habitation. For the first time, evidence for flint-working has now been uncovered within the settlement. West of the later fortification wall, in which a com- plex gate structure was previously discovered, further excavations have revealed no evidence for habitation; this wall appears to mark the final limits of the 40 Infra, and Herscher 288-89. 41 Herscher 261-62. 42 Witness several articles inJMA 9 (1996): S.

As the government of the Republic of Cyprus continues its con- version to a new system of transliterating Greek names into the Roman alphabet, the discrepancies between site names used on government maps and signs and those used in the traditional archaeological literature continue to grow. Thus road signs for this popular tourist destination read "Choirokoitia," while the newly published guidebook (as well as most comprehensive guides to Cyprus and all archae- ological literature) refers to the site as "Khirokitia." 46 Herscher 262-63. The most recent site report (A. Le Brun, Fouilles recentes ad Khirokitia (Chypre), 1988-1991, Paris 1994) is especially interesting for the excavator's analyses of the use of domestic space and the spatial organization of the village; this volume also includes two chapters on the fish and shellfish remains from another important aceramic Neolithic site excavated by Le Brun, Cape An- dreas Kastros.

Outside the wall the natural rock drops off sharply and then rises again to form a sort of ditch. The construction of the wall aug- mented this natural protection on the west, while the other three sides of the settlement were protected by sharp escarpments dropping down to the sur- rounding bend in the Maroni River. While it remains enigmatic whom or what these arrangements were intended to defend against, the settlement's features clearly demonstrate the inhabitants' desire to con- trol access and circulation within. Khirokitia is among the sites recently selected by the Department of Antiquities for improvement of its touristic presentation. In 1997 a visitors' center, composed of four replicas of the Neolithic houses and part of the fortification entrance, opened adja- cent to the excavated area.48 This event was accom- panied by the publication of an excellent new guide- book to the site.49 Kholetria Ortos. The University of Nevada-Las Vegas excavations at aceramic Neolithic Kholetria Ortos in western Cyprus, under the direction of Alan H. Simmons, concluded with a third season in 1994 and preliminary results have been published.50 In spite of the expansion of the excavated area in 1994 (for a total exposure of 58 m2), no architecture and only a few remnants of intact features were found. Yet within these confines a huge assemblage of ar- tifactual material was recovered, most notably a large (more than 62,000 pieces) and varied sample of chipped stone representing all stages of production. The site yielded a total of at least two dozen of the enigmatic incised ground stone cobbles, which have parallels from Neolithic sites in the Levant.51 Two baked clay human figurines are also of particular interest.52 In addition to a large faunal assemblage, some human bones have been identified. Radiocar- bon determinations fit securely within the later part of the Cypriot aceramic Neolithic.53 During the summer of 1997 the University of Nevada-Las Vegas team conducted limited test ex- cavations at two small aceramic Neolithic sites in the western uplands in order to assess their research potential. Neolithic occupation in this region has been little investigated, as the larger villages, such as Kholetria Ortos, tend to be concentrated in low- land areas within 10 km of the sea. The test sites, Kannaviou Kochina (or Kokkina) and Kritou Marot- tou Ais Yiorkis, were originally recorded by the Cana- dian Palaipaphos Survey Project under the direction of David Rupp.54 The 1997 trials indicated that Kan- naviou Kochina may have been a large aceramic Neo- lithic settlement, but is now badly disturbed. Ais Yiorkis, however, produced abundant chipped stone and animal remains, and shows evidence for in situ deposits. Parekklisha Shillourokambos. The expedition of the French School at Athens working in the vicinity of ancient Amathus completed the first phase of its ex- cavation, under the direction of Jean Guilaine, at the important Neolithic site of Parekklisha Shillou- rokambos in 1994; a comprehensive preliminary re- port has appeared.55 Excavations resumed in 1996 and are continuing. Two distinct aceramic phases were recorded.56 The earlier one, dated by radiocarbon to ca. 7600- 7500 B.C., is so far unattested elsewhere in Cyprus and suggests that the earliest Neolithic culture of the island was more closely contemporary with its presumed sources in the Levant and/or Anatolia. The later phase produced poorly preserved remains of circular stone architecture, of the type well known at Khirokitia (supra) and Kalavasos Tenta.57 Architec- tural evidence for the earlier phase, however, was 48 Hadjisavvas (supra n. 4) 6, fig. 3. 49 A.

Also noteworthy, particularly in the earlier ace- ramic phase, was the relatively large amount of ob- sidian recovered- more than twice as many pieces as from any other Cypriot aceramic Neolithic site. Analysis has determined that the source of the ob- sidian was Cappadocia, although there is evidence that some pieces may have been worked locally from imported raw material. The faunal remains from the earlier phase are also highly significant, indicating the probable presence of cattle among the usual ca- prines, pig, and deer; cattle are unknown from other, "classic," aceramic Neolithic sites in Cyprus. In the later phase, dog is attested, but cow has not been found. Paralimni Nissia. Pavlos Flourentzos of the Depart- ment of Antiquities began excavations in 1995 at the ceramic Neolithic settlement at the site of Nissia, a hill near Paralimni on the east coast of the island. It is believed to be the largest settlement of this period known in Cyprus and its coastal location is unique. Two seasons of work have uncovered subrectan- gular houses with stone foundations, similar to those known from Sotira Teppes in southern Cyprus.58 Socketed stone bases for a post roof support, a clay support for a large vessel, hearths inside and out- side the houses, and beaten havara or stone pebble floors are additional features found in the settle- ment. Of particular significance is a stone wall, up to 2 m wide, that appears to enclose the settlement on its south side (fig. 5). The wall begins near the sea and extends westward, ending at the river that encircles the northern side of the settlement. Ad- ditional walls, structures, and hearths were found south of the wall, perhaps part of a later extension of the settlement. The artifacts recovered include many andesite and flint stone tools, some representing new types, am- ulets of stone and picrolite, unusual figurines, bone tools, and a large amount of deer bone and antler. The pottery consists of the usual Combed ware as well as new varieties of shapes and decoration. Kandou Kouphovounos. Eleni Mantzourani of the University of Athens has continued her excavations Fig. 5. Paralimni Nissia. Wall surrounding the Neolithic settlement. at the extensive ceramic Neolithic site of Kouphovou- nos near the village of Kandou in the Kouris River valley.59 Additional closely set subrectangular struc- tures with numerous interior installations (such as hearths and platforms) and many artifacts on the floors have been uncovered in all areas of the site (fig. 6). Up to six phases of occupation have been identified in some buildings. Burials (both adult and child) were made under the floor of at least one room. Open areas adjacent to the structures provide evi- dence for domestic activities as well. While most of the ceramics and ground and chipped stone are of usual Late Neolithic types, the large amount and unusual forms of picrolite orna- ments are noteworthy, as is a large deposit of un- worked jasper pebbles. Other artifacts include querns, shells, a schematized anthropomorphic lime- stone figurine, a clay figurine fragment, and the skull of a horned animal. Kissonerga Mylouthkia.

Chalcolithic site of Kissonerga Mylouthkia in 1994 and 1995.60 Previous excavations conducted in 1976-1980 and rescue excavations in 1989 had found pits and hol- lows containing occupational debris and had identified the site as belonging to a transitional phase between the Sotira and Erimi cultures (ca. 3600 B.C.).61 The new excavations for the first time revealed architectural remains- in the form of a large circu- lar building (B200) located next to a large pit found in previous seasons-the only Early Chalcolithic building known so far in Cyprus. The building, 6 m in diameter, is well constructed of large calcar- enite stones and mud mortar. Its walls are preserved to a height of 0.50 m and are about 0.50 m wide, plastered with mud and havara on both the interior and exterior faces; a large flat stone marked the en- trance. Small ceramic vessels, stone and bone tools, lids, antler beads, and figurines were found on the floor. Human bones of a juvenile were also found on the floor, crushed by collapsing roof debris. Beneath building B200 were found traces of an earlier wooden pit dwelling structure, represented by an arc of postholes and the impressions of withies woven between the posts. Another fragment of a stone wall, also beneath building B200, confirms the ex- istence of multiple phases in this part of the site. An additional pit dwelling, 5 m in diameter with post- holes for the support of a roof and a foyer, appears to be contemporary with the stone building. It con- tained a low bench of earth and clay, a small stone and earth pot support, and a clay basin. The excavation of two wells at Mylouthkia proved inconclusive for dating, although they may be ace- ramic Neolithic. Both were equipped with handl footholds cut into the sides of the shafts. The first ended at a depth of 8.1 m where there was a small underground stream channel. Finds included nu- merous ground stone objects such as vessel frag- ments, pounders, and grinders, and several pieces of obsidian, but no ceramics. The second has been excavated to a depth of 4.5 m. Its fill contained scat- tered human and caprine bones along with abun- dant stone artifacts similar to those from the first well, but again no ceramics. 60 The Lemba Archaeological Project is also continuing long-term research into prehistoric building practices. The most recent building constructed at the Lemba Experi- mental Village will be used to study the effects of erosion, collapse, and burial on various types of artifacts and archae- ological deposits. 61 Herscher 260.

The Department of Antiqui- ties, under the direction of Demos Christou, has re- sumed trials at the Early Chalcolithic cemetery at Souskiou Vathyrkakas in western Cyprus.62 Souskiou is believed to be the source of much undocumented Cypriot Chalcolithic material now in private and public collections. Intact tombs continue to elude scientific investigation of the site, but some finds of exceptional quality left behind by the looters have been recovered. These include picrolite cruciform figurines, a terracotta figurine of a pregnant woman, and Red-on-White ceramics elaborately decorated with geometric motifs. One askos appears to be in- tended as a replica of a bunch of grapes. Prastio Ayios Savvas tis Karonos Monastery. The West- ern Cyprus Project, under the direction of David W. Rupp of Brock University, in 1995 concluded the first phase of its fieldwork in the region of the Dhiarizos River drainage.6 The principal focus of excavation beginning in 1991 was the presumed Middle Chal- colithic site of Prastio Ayios Savvas tis Karonos Mon- astery. While the extensive erosion encountered in previous seasons continued to characterize the site, some fragmentary in situ architectural remains, con- sisting of a small section of curving wall with adjoin- ing floor, were found in one area. A small rock-cut ossuary encountered in another part of the site con- tained poorly preserved remains of five individuals along with a picrolite cruciform figurine and Den- talium shells, seemingly the result of a secondary de- position. Chipped stone was abundant throughout the site, with two distinct assemblages identified; the excavators suggest that this distinction is due to the artifacts having been eroded onto the site from two separate nearby settlements. Tests in another area revealed architectural frag- ments dating to the later Cypro-Archaic and Roman periods. A deposit of 15 terracotta figurines may sug- gest the existence of an Iron Age rural sanctuary. BRONZE AGE The Bronze Age continues to be one of the most dynamic areas of archaeological research in Cyprus, both in the field and in theoretical and interpretive discussions. The Late Cypriot period is the main fo- cus of attention, with ongoing large-scale excavations at the major sites of Maroni, Kalavasos Ayios Dhimi- trios, and Alassa, numerous publications, and a ple- thora of international colloquia. But this survey also reports important new discoveries concerning the Early Bronze Age: early levels at Marki that help to clarify the very beginning of the Bronze Age in Cy- prus, and a new settlement of the period at Pyrgos, with perhaps the earliest direct evidence for metal- lurgy on the island. In spite of the intensity of systematic field research into the Bronze Age, accidental discoveries still pro- duce surprising results. In May 1995 a participant in an Archaeological Institute of America tour to Cyprus, Scott L. Manske, discovered several Bronze Age gaming stones while the group was visiting the well-known cemetery of Dhenia Kafkallia (fig. 7).64 Noted were several examples of senet and a mehen cut into the exposed bedrock. While gaming stones are now very well attested from Bronze Age sites on the island, these are the first examples of nonportable playing surfaces. Their proximity to the tombs also seems to establish a clear funerary association for gaming activity. Also noteworthy, but even more puzzling, was the accidental discovery of 24 pots, apparently dating to the Middle Cypriot period, found deep within a large cave in the Akamas area by spelunkers. It is 62 For background and summary of previous discoveries at the site, see D. Christou, "The Chalcolithic Cemetery 1 at Souskiou-Vathyrkakas," in E.

Foremost among the important publications on the Bronze Age of the past three years are two final reports on Early and Middle Bronze Age sites, Alam- bra Moutes and Marki Alonia (the first volume of the ongoing Australian excavations) (infra). While not a final excavation report, a new publication on Ta- massos (infra), including the Bronze Age as well as later phases of the site, is helpful and welcome.65 The papers of two recent colloquia concerned with different aspects of the Late Bronze Age have also appeared in print. The first, Cyprus in the 11th Cen- tury B.C., edited by V. Karageorghis,66 was the first international symposium organized by the ARU of the University of Cyprus and sets a high standard for prompt publication. The participants- scholars specializing in the Aegean, Levant, and Cyprus-- focused on a period known to bring major political and cultural changes to Cyprus, but for which there is scanty archaeological evidence. In contrast, the second colloquium publication, Late Bronze Age Set- tlement in Cyprus: Function and Relationship, edited by Paul Astr6m and Ellen Herscher (SIMA-PB 126, Jonsered 1996), includes papers first presented at the 1993 AIA Annual Meeting that closely examine the archaeological evidence from several major sites. A. Bernard Knapp, who served as a discussant for the session, subsequently expanded his commentary into a more thorough examination of approaches to settlement and landscape archaeology in LBA Cyprus.67 Finally, three very different specialized studies have made extremely useful contributions to LBA re- search: D. Pilides, Handmade Burnished Wares of the Late Bronze Age in Cyprus (SIMA 105,Jonsered 1994), which helps clarify the significance of a common but widely ignored class of ceramics; A.B. Knapp and J.E Cherry, Provenience Studies and Bronze Age Cyprus: Production, Exchange and Politico-Economic Change (Madi- son 1994), integrating scientific provenience data of ceramics and metals with archaeological data and theories of Mediterranean trade; and third, an in- dispensable sourcebook for the "Alashiya problem" edited by Knapp68 publishes in English all 122 Bronze Age and early Iron Age Near Eastern and Aegean texts that are thought by most scholars to refer to the island of Cyprus. A balanced introduc- tion summarizes the philological, geopolitical, and historical issues. Pyrgos Mavrorakia. The village of Pyrgos, east of Limassol and northeast of the ancient city-kingdom of Amathus, has been known for several years as a major center for Early Bronze Age remains in south- ern Cyprus.

Marki Alonia and Davari. The Australian Cyprus Expedition excavations at Marki, under the direction of David Frankel andJennifer M. Webb of La Trobe University, continue to produce highly significant evidence for the organization and evolution of the early part of the Cypriot Bronze Age.71 The fourth and fifth seasons of work took place during the win- ters of 1995-1996 and 1996-1997. The excavation of a dirt road that previously had divided the two parts of the excavated area at Alonia, on the bank of the Alykos River, has helped to clar- ify the construction phases and has exposed a more coherent overall plan of the extensive settlement. For the first time a linked set of rooms could be clearly identified as a single house (fig. 8). Three ad- joining rooms with a single entry were furnished with pebble-lined "pot emplacements," plaster-lined hearths, benches, a bin, and an oven. Three stone bases in the first, largest, room (unit XIII) were prob- ably for roof support. This room contained a con- siderable amount of pottery, two large limestone bowls, numerous stone tools of various kinds, and a hob -equipment that appears to form part of the systematic inventory of the room. A fragmentary ex- ample of a rare terracotta cradle figurine was built into a plaster bench. Most important for Early Cypriot chronology, evi- dence for several phases of occupation, modifica- tions, and rebuilding continues to be apparent in the southern part of the excavated area.72 In their 70 M.R.

Marki Alonia. White Painted IA (Philia) spouted bowl. first report, the excavators defined four phases for the occupation of the site, extending from EC I/II (phase D) to at least Middle Cypriot I (phase A);73 further work suggests that these phasings may re- quire modification as the depositional and architec- tural history of the site becomes better understood. The lowest deposits, below the surviving architecture, consist of naturally accumulating sediments contain- ing large amounts of well-preserved animal bone, chipped stone, and Philia-type pottery (fig. 9), which the excavators believe is domestic refuse that has washed down after being discarded from structures upslope, outside the excavated area. A variety of post- holes and pits, but no architecture, has yet been found associated with the Philia material. These de- posits have now produced the first radiocarbon date for a sealed Philia phase deposit (a pit), a calibrated date of 2440-2120 B.C. There was at least one other phase at Marki pre- ceding the major EC III-MC I construction. Although the latter destroyed most of the earlier architecture and associated deposits, parts of the walls belonging to one earlier building (unit LXIII) survived, contain- ing Red Polished I-II ware, a plaster hearth, and a pebble-lined "pot emplacement." Below this building too were deposits with Philia material. The discov- ery of two intramural burials indicates that human remains were occasionally inhumed within a settle- ment area, in spite of the vast extramural cemeteries typical of Early and Middle Bronze Age Cyprus. In addition to their main focus in the Alonia set- tlement, the Australian expedition has cleared two looted tombs (tombs 5 and 6) in the nearby Marki Davari cemetery in order to test the salvage poten- tial of the hundreds of looted tombs in this and other cemeteries surrounding the settlement.74 Little re- mained in tomb 5, which appeared to be a fairly stan- dard EC III/MC I chamber tomb. Tomb 6, however, proved to be a shallow pit tomb of the Philia phase, containing a large quantity of Red Polished I (Phi- lia) and White Painted IA (Philia) wares and a spiral earring of copper or bronze of a type known from Philia tombs elsewhere. Larnaca Alyki ("Hala Sultan Tekke"). Paul Astr6m of the University of G6teborg continues his excava- tions at the major Late Bronze Age harbor town on the shore of the Larnaca Salt Lake, near the Moslem shrine of Hala Sultan Tekke.75 While the scale of the ongoing work remains small, a considerable area of the site is now exposed, providing a good represen- tation of the layout of the town, which is built on a grid system along wide streets (the main north- south street in area 8 is about 4 m wide). The total area of the Bronze Age town has been estimated at about 600 x 460 m. Most of the buildings excavated appear to be domestic in nature, several with sophis- ticated drainage systems and finely constructed bath- rooms recalling Minoan practices, although a possible sanctuary and a smithy's workshop have also been identified in recent seasons. Tests and remote sensing around the perimeter of the site have so far found no indications of the existence of a fortifica- tion wall, in contrast to the nearby site of Kition, which was surrounded by a cyclopean wall. The rich international character of the finds from the site reflects the importance of its fine natural harbor.76 Evidence for metalworking also occurs fre- quently: of particular interest are a number of molds for use in manufacturing arrowheads, rectangular strips of uncertain function (fig. 10), and possibly the distinctive Late Cypriot bronze tripods.

The long- term British School at Athens/University of Cincin- nati project at Maroni Vournes, under the direction of Gerald Cadogan, continued with brief study sea- sons and limited excavation in 1994 and 1996.77 The main objectives of the recent work have been to clar- ify the early (LC I-IIB) stratigraphy in the area north of the Basin Building, where an important deposit of fine wares provides evidence for the development of White Slip and other wares. The large LC I-II building at the southern edge of the site has also been reexamined in order to determine more pre- cisely the sequence of its construction and modifica- tions. These studies suggest that Maroni may have rivaled Enkomi in importance at the dawn of the Late Bronze Age.  -  .-- cm, Fig. 11. Hala Sultan Tekke.

The main excavations since 1994 have been carried out in two areas close to the sea where tests and geo- magnetic survey indicated that architecture was pres- ent.79 Building 1, where the cylinder seal was found in 1993, appears to be a relatively large complex struc- ture (estimated total size of about 20 x 20 m) of LC IIC date, much damaged by later pits and the prox- imity of the modern plowed surface. Small rooms with durable lime plaster floors and containing small pithoi surround a larger entry or courtyard; other finds include pottery, fragments of metal sheeting and a needle, slag, and a loomweight. The building appears to have been built over and into earlier (LC IIB) tombs that existed in the area, a sequence that is also attested at Vournes. It was abandoned toward the end of LC IIC, after being swept clean of most of its contents. Building 2 lies approximately 50 m to the east of Building 1 and seems to be similar in size, plan, and construction. Of particular interest is an unusual floor of pebbles set into red-brown terra rossa ma- terial (fig. 12), which appears to have been subjected to heat. A pithoid jar was set into the floor and a large quantity of metal slag was found in the deposit above (but not on) the floor. Both these buildings are interpreted by the excavator as centers for craft or production activity, rather than of domestic pur- pose. Building 2, with its installations suitable for the processing of liquids, has some similarities to features at Kalavasos Avios Dhimitrios (infra), especially Building XI, which may have been used for olive oil production.80 The remains of 10 looted or previously excavated (presumably by the British Museum expedition of 1897) tombs, dating mainly to the 14th century B.C., near the sea at Tsaroukkas have also been studied by the MTMTP. The high percentage of imported pot- tery, primarily Mycenaean, recovered from these con- siderably disturbed contexts is noteworthy. In addi- tion to Mycenaean wares, finds from the settlement include Minoan pithoidjars, Egyptian amphoras, and Canaanite jars. Trial excavations at the locality known as Aspres, about 700 m inland and about 300 m west of Vournes, revealed additional LC IIC architecture with a fine plaster floor, a large pithos sunk into it, and many other sherds of large pithoi. The area appears to have been reused in the Archaic and possibly Late HellenisticlEarly Roman periods. According to Man- 79 Manning et al. (supra n. 78) fig. 2 (field 58). 8o Herscher 271; A.K. South, "Kalavasos-Ayios Dhimitrios 1991," RDAC 1992, 135-39.</page><page sequence="18">326 ELLEN HERSCHER [AJA 102 ning, the results of the MTMTP's work suggest that the region comprising Maroni Vournes, Tsaroukkas, and vicinity contains several relatively discrete Late Bronze areas of use, perhaps with distinct separate functions, which combine to form a single, albeit dis- persed, greater LBA urban "site." The large number of Aegean imports known to come from Maroni has long suggested that it may have been a major trading center. Exploration of the possible port facilities associated with the site be- gan in 1993, with more systematic underwater sur- veys in succeeding seasons. More than 45 stone an- chors have been recorded (fig. 13), many of them concentrated directly offshore from the mouth of a gully that lies along the northeast side of Tsarouk- kas and continues inland at least as far as Vournes.81 Potsherds of a wide range of dates were dispersed on the seabed over the entire survey area, but a con- centration of large sherds of homogeneous LC IA date in a single area is of considerable importance, since this date coincides with the beginning of ma- jor Cypriot imports into Syria-Palestine. These finds support the hypothesis that a port or anchorage ex- isted in the area of Tsaroukkas, and Manning has sug- gested that the present gully may have been a nav- igable inlet during the Bronze Age. Kalavasos Ayios Dhimitrios. Excavations by the Va- silikos Valley Project (VVP), under the field direc- tion of Alison K. South, have continued annually through 1997 at this major Late Bronze Age town near the chapel of Ayios Dhimitrios south of Kal- avasos village, adjoining the highway to Limassol (fig. 14).2 Recent work has been directed toward examin- ing the stratigraphic sequence of earlier occupation at the site (preceding the final major LC IIC phase) and has included the excavation of several tombs con- taining rich material. In addition, further investi- gations of the structures around Building X ("B.X" on fig. 14) have revealed more of the plan of the set- tlement. Building X is approached from several di- rections and also surrounded by narrow streets con- taining drains and other provisions for controlling rainwater. Other multiroomed buildings, less mon- umental in construction, occupy the adjacent "blocks" of the excavated area. Fig. 13. Maroni Tsaroukkas seabed survey. Stone anchor. The area southwest of Building X (south of Build- ing XI) provided additional evidence for olive oil production; rich occupational debris with animal bones and ash was found next to a Canaanitejar that was built into a wall-like structure and possibly used as an oven (fig. 15). South of this, Building XV con- tained several pithoi of various sizes and other fea- tures suggesting some kind of industrial or agricul- tural processing. The finds from the LC IIC buildings include Mycenaean pottery (LH IIIB) as well as im- ports from the Levant and Egypt.

Ear- lier floors have also been found in the Pithos Hall on the west side of Building X. These and other re- cent tests make it clear that the west and north parts (at least) of Building X were completely reconstructed with much ashlar masonry in LC IIC, on the same or closely similar lines as a preexisting building. At the same time various storage and industrial facil- ities on the north and west were built or redeveloped and the level of the street on the west was raised. Further investigations are necessary to determine whether similar rebuilding occurred in the eastern and southeastern parts of the building. In the south- ern part of the excavated area, however, several suc- cessive floors have been found belonging to the badly robbed Building XII. The VVP has investigated several tombs in the most recent seasons, the most significant of which are tomb 14 and the complex of tombs 18-20. Tomb 14 (fig. 14), lying in the wide street approaching Building X at its southwest corner and just north of tomb 13,83 was not intact when discovered, but contained many luxurious and unusual items, such as three 83 Herscher 271-72.</page><page sequence="20">328 ELLEN HERSCHER [AJA 102 Fig. 16.

The Mycenaean pottery from tomb 14 included a krater decorated with two large birds and dates the tomb to LC IIB (LH IIIA2). Tombs 18-20 are two chambers and a large niche opening from a single dromos, located in the west- ern part of what is known to be the extent of the Late Bronze Age site, about 150 m west of Building X and 75 m north of the highway. In comparison to the tombs from the northeast area of the site (the vicinity of Building X), the excavator considers them to be "upper middle class" rather than "elite." They are the first to be found of this type, however, with benches all around the chamber, a deep rectangular central depression, and stepped stomia leading to each chamber. Tomb 18 may have been reused in the Late Geometric period, but otherwise the complex ap- pears to have been used over a considerable span of the LBA, at least through LC IIB and IIC. Along with considerable amounts of Mycenaean pottery, the tombs contained some of the few examples of Minoan pottery found at Ayios Dhimitrios, as well as luxury items such as gold and silver jewelry, glass, and ivory. The latest work at Ayios Dhimitrios has provided considerable new evidence to help clarify its chro- nology. The very small amounts of MC III-LC I ma- terial recovered to date are still inconclusive regard- ing possible occupation of the site at this time. Use of the area at least as a cemetery is confirmed be- ginning in LC IIA1, but the chronological sequence for both settlement architecture and tombs has now been extended over the period LC IIA2 through LC IIC. During LC IIA2/IIB there were extensive build- ings with a very wealthy tomb (tomb 11) adjacent. The initial construction of Building X may have been in late LC IIB or more likely.in early LC IIC; rebuild- ing with ashlar took place later in LC IIC. Prelim- inary results from radiocarbon determinations sug- gest that the beams used in the construction of Building X date to around 1420-1400 B.C. Alassa Paliotaverna. Sophocles Hadjisavvas of the Department of Antiquities is continuing his annual excavations at the impressive Late Cypriot site near the old village of Alassa in the upper Kouris River valley, above the modern artificial lake created by the Kouris dam.84 The work to date has focused on determining the extent and plan of the monumental ashlar Building II, which has now been fully exposed (fig. 17). Building II covers an area of 1,410 m2, one of the largest structures known from LBA Cyprus. It was erected after a major operation to prepare a level surface by cutting away the rocky hill against which the building rests and filling in the slope below. Its n-shaped plan is unique in Cyprus, with long north and south wings (length 37.7 m) connected by a 84 Herscher 272-74; a preliminary report has appeared as well as an interpretive study: S.

The quality of the ash- lar masonry is very fine (therefore unfortunately attractive to stone robbers, perhaps as early as the Archaic period), with drafted margins and lifting bosses (fig. 18); some individual blocks measure up to 2.5 x 1.6 m.85 Use of the building ended when it was destroyed by fire. The south wing86 has a pair of small rooms (one contained a bathtub) at each end and an unusual sunken stone-built rectangular feature near the center. The wing underwent several alterations at a later phase: a new floor was laid, the sunken fea- ture was covered over, and thin dividing walls along with a central room with an open hearth were added. The north wing,'87 at its east end, includes a long rec- tangular storeroom with a stone floor. This room contained two rows of pithoi, the northern row set into circular depressions in the floor and the south- ern row set on circular stone bases. Storagejars were also found outside the building, between the north wall and the cut-away bedrock (fig. 18), an area that would have been naturally cool and was apparently used as a "cellar." The west wing- the part most damaged by stone robbers - comprises a series of small rooms and cor- ridors. Elaborate stone drainage and sewage features (fig. 19) similar to some at the Palace of Knossos were found here and at the west end of the north wing. The inner courtyard had a cement-like floor, into which many pits had been cut to support storage vessels of various sizes. Two pillar bases lay near the north wing, probably for supporting a portico. Finds from the building were scanty, consisting mainly of pithos sherds. A large number of these bore seal impressions, most commonly portraying chariot scenes,88 but also occurring are a procession of bulls and humans, combat between warriors and 85 One stone plinth in the south facade of the building, discovered in 1992, is nearly 5 m in length. 86 Referred to as "Building II" and partially described in Herscher 273-74, fig. 17. 87 Thought initially to be a third building (cf.

Except for their indication of ex- tensive storage facilities, the finds were too few to provide further information regarding the function of the building. However, the palatial character of the architecture at Alassa and its dominant position between the copper-producing areas and the sea coast have prompted the excavator to speculate that the modern name may have some connection to the elusive Bronze Age Alashiya. For additional discoveries relating to the Late Bronze Age, see the entries below for "Dhali Ambeleri (Ancient Idalion)" and "Discoveries outside Cyprus." ARCHAIC, CLASSICAL, HELLENISTIC Excavation at several city-kingdom sites has con- tinued, although some of the long-term projects (e.g., the French expeditions to Kition and Amathus, Marion-Arsinoe, and the Kourion acropolis) are now winding down to concentrate on publication. Except for ancient Idalion and Nea Paphos, where major excavation is ongoing, the most productive field activity has focused on the smaller support com- munities of the hinterland.89 These results are prov- ing invaluable for the formation of a more multi- dimensional interpretation of the historic periods in Cyprus. Foremost among the noteworthy publications for these periods is the first comprehensive study of the Cypro-Archaic period since the Swedish Cyprus Ex- pedition's 1948 volume: A.T.

On top of the west acropolis, Ambeleri, Maria Hadji- costi of the Department of Antiquities continues her exploration of the Phoenician administrative center. The Phoenicians built this large complex against the north city wall sometime in the late fifth century B.C. after they had taken over Idalion, apparently on the foundations of an earlier (early fifth century B.C.) larger building that is believed to be the destroyed eastern part of the royal palace.96 The massive west wall of the Phoenician building, 1.65 m wide and preserved to a height of 2.5 m, was originally part of the earlier structure. The part excavated seems to consist of storerooms and workshops. Two rows of long parallel rooms (to date, 10 have been exposed) enclose the north and west sides of a large courtyard and the building ap- parently extends to the south, where future excava- tions will continue. Most of the rooms contained large pithoi; an olive press and evidence for metalwork- ing were also found within the building. The most important finds are two groups of inscriptions, now totaling at least 120, written predominantly in Phoe- nician with a few in the Cypriot syllabary, which were found on the floors of three of the rooms (most from room 8, however). These consist of several dozen en- graved ostraka and a larger group of inscriptions painted in black on gypsum plaques. They represent the economic records of the Phoenician administra- tion at Idalion and are dated stratigraphically to the early phases of the building's use. The Phoenicians appear to have abandoned the complex toward the end of the fourth century B.C., perhaps when its func- tions were consolidated at Kition. There has been further examination of the city wall in recent seasons. It has at least three different architectural phases, dated from the end of the sixth century to the end of the fourth century B.C. The lower part was built of local stones up to a height of 3 m; the superstructure was originally of mud- brick. Additional evidence for metallurgical activity has been found outside the wall along its north face. The most significant new discovery is an area of Late Bronze Age occupation, located on the lower terrace of Ambeleri about 70 m east of the Phoeni- cian building and covering an area of about 2,000 m2. It is presumably related to the LBA remains on the top of the hill excavated by the Swedish Cyprus Expedition in 1927-1931.97 The remains so far un- covered are interpreted as large-scale industrial in- stallations. They include a few rooms, numerous cir- cular pits (perhaps for embedding pithoi) that reflect exposure to high temperatures, ovens, ashes, slag, and other evidence for metalworking. The installa- tions appear to be at least partly surrounded by an enclosure wall, some of which is constructed of ash- lar masonry. Three architectural phases have been distinguished, with pottery dated from the very be- ginning of LC IIIA through Cypro-Geometric I (ca. 1200-1000 B.C.). Other finds from the area include pithos fragments, stone bowl or basin fragments, querns, and the head of a Mycenaean figurine. The University of Arizona excavations under the direction of Pamela Gaber are continuing in the area of the eastern acropolis of ancient Idalion, the hill know as Moutti tou Arvili, and in an industrial area of the lower city. Further exploration of the sanctuary, which in its later phases the excavator connects with the cult of Adonis, has shown that this open-air temenos extends for at least six acres. It was carved out from the shoul- der of the hill and enclosed by a wall. Below the Ro- man steps of the entrance found previously, succes- sive Hellenistic, Classical, and possibly Archaic levels have now been recognized, showing that the form of this sacred precinct has a continuous history. Within the temenos evidence for copper-working (fig. 22) and small-scale olive oil extraction (both per- haps for ceremonial or ritualistic purposes) has been found. Other finds date the use of the temenos from Cypro-Geometric (eighth century B.C.) down to the Roman period (first century B.C.) The expedition has also relocated the altar ex- plored by R.H. Lang in the 1860s; initial exploration has revealed at least three main phases of use. A Hel- lenistic platform (third and second centuries B.C.) was constructed above the Archaic altar (possibly as early as the seventh century B.C.), which was found with its kernos top still in situ. Beneath the Archaic structure and following the same orientation, an ear- lier (still undated) feature has been detected. Nu- merous terracotta figurines occur in the area. In the area of the lower city where the Arizona 96 Partly excavated by the American expedition of the 1970s: see L.E. Stager and A.

Building B has been identified as an olive oil production center founded in the Classical period (ca. 425 B.C.). Its lim- its have been defined and one room of the building excavated. It contained a plaster and pise ramp and a circular feature that is probably a pithos stand; fragments of large storage vessels were found in the room debris. The excavated room is located near two deep vats and an olive press, the impressive pebble and concrete press-bed of which was found in 1992.98 The counterweight for the press was found in 1995 north of Building B. To the east of the oil production center a large circular pit or bothros, over 3 m in diameter, has been excavated. It produced a large amount of Cypro- Archaic painted pottery, fragments of horse and rider figurines, and a broken offering stand of a type found in Levantine holy places of the Persian period. Most of the material in the bothros dates to the seventh century B.C., but a few finds indicate that the debris must have been placed there in the Hellenistic period. Building C, of the Hellenistic period (ca. 250 B.C.), lies just southeast of the bothros, along a road run- ning from the west acropolis. To the north of it was found a large plaster-lined vat, 1.3 x 1 m, with sev- eral large pieces of sandstone inside it. Nearby were fragments of worked horn and several horn cores: this unique installation, possibly used in the process- ing of horn, is dated to the sixth century B.C. Aradippou Panayia Ematousa. Following trial ex- cavations in 1991, which revealed human occupation near the village of Aradippou in southeastern Cy- prus from at least the Archaic to the Late Roman period, Lone Wriedt Sorensen of the University of Copenhagen began in 1993 a major project south of the church of Panayia Ematousa."9 It continues the welcome trend in Cypriot archaeology to explore the hinterlands that helped support the better-known cities.'00 The site is located on the route between the an- cient city-kingdoms of Kition (infra) and Idalion (supra) and gains particular interest due to the his- torical takeover of Idalion by Kition sometime in the fifth century B.C. It is also near the modern, di- rect, "old road" between Larnaca and Nicosia, further emphasizing the locality's importance for coastal- inland communications. An adjacent river provided the inhabitants and travelers with easy access to water. The main area excavated to date lies on the top of a flat hill (fig. 23). Two main architectural phases have been distinguished, the earlier of them begin- ning perhaps in the Late Classical and continuing into the Hellenistic, and the second (better repre- sented) period from the Late Hellenistic into the Early Roman period (first century B.C./A.D.). Finds suggest that the site may have been abandoned from about A.D. 150 until the second half of the fifth cen- tury, when some reoccupation may have continued until the seventh century (although no architecture is yet associated with this last period). In the first century B.C./A.D. a complex of one large and perhaps several smaller buildings apparently covered the entire hill. The southern limit of the main building has been uncovered, but the structure continues beyond the excavated area to the north, east, and perhaps west. The wall construction tech- nique is relatively insubstantial, especially in rela- tion to the apparent size of the complex. As exca- vated to date the plan of this building consists of a series of small rooms, some paved with slabs, and one longer room that contained a stone-built plat- form with ashes and evidence for burning on top. Other parts of the building have been identified as additional work areas containing unusual features such as benches, bins, and platforms. A courtyard may adjoin the south side. This building appears to have been destroyed, perhaps by an earthquake, then repaired and reused. Around the periphery of the building are a series of unique small stone-built subterranean rooms or 98 Herscher 275. 99 Preliminary reports have appeared in RDAC 1992 and 1996.

Just east of pit 2, near the western edge of the excavated area, is an unusual stone-built "box" constructed of flat slabs and fill, possibly an altar. Finds from the complex included Hellenistic-Early Roman kitchen ware, local and im- ported tableware, imported amphoras from Cos, Chios, Rhodes, Phoenicia, and elsewhere, a wide array of stone tools and vessels, evidence for olive oil production, stone and terracotta weights prob- ably used for weaving, an iron key, and a few coins, most of them struck in Cyprus. Walls belonging to the earlier architectural phase (Late Classical?/Hellenistic) have only been revealed beneath the main complex in a few places in the southern part of the excavated area. They appear to be of more substantial stone construction than the later structures. Evidence for even earlier occupation at Panayia Ematousa comes mainly from pits 2 and 8, which con- tained Cypro-Archaic and Cypro-Classical pottery, imported Ionian ceramics, a number of Archaic figurines of various types, and a fragment of a boat model. Other pits throughout the site contained ma- terial of various dates; a few stray LBA sherds rep- resent the earliest finds from the immediate area. Ordinary domestic or industrial architecture is little known from contemporary sites in Cyprus, and many features found at Aradippou Panayia Ematousa are unparalleled. It appears to have been a rural set- tlement, engaged in the production of olive oil and perhaps other domestic products, but the substan- tial architecture, at least in the earlier period, sug- gests that it was more than a village. In the use of decorated tableware, glass, and imported wine (as attested by the amphoras), life at Panayia Ematousa appears in many ways comparable to that at city sites of the period.</page><page sequence="28">336 ELLEN HERSCHER [AJA 102 Larnaca Bamboula (Ancient Kition). The French mission under the direction of Marguerite Yon of the University of Lyons is continuing its excavations at the site of Bamboula, in the area of the ancient harbor of Kition.'o' A total of seven shipsheds has now been cleared. Investigation to determine the length of the shipsheds, which would provide evi- dence for the size of the ships that they sheltered, has been hampered by the high water table around the lower (north) end of the ramps, but a length of at least 30 m has now been recorded. Ayia Varvara Almyras. The Swiss project, with par- ticipants from the University of Zurich and the Na- tional Museum of Switzerland, under the direction of Walter Fasnacht has concluded 10 seasons of ex- cavation (1988-1995) at the copper production site of Ayia Varvara Almyras.102 Continuing analysis of the finds promises to provide much additional new information regarding the materials and methods used in ancient mining and smelting. The project has now shifted its field operations to conduct an archaeometallurgical survey in the Sha River valley in the region of the Mathiatis mine, under the des- ignation Sia-Mathiatis-Agia Varvara Survey Project (supra). 103 Approximately 70% of the small (50 x 50 m) site of Almyras has now been excavated. The smelting area lies on a hillock, the mining area 30 m to the west. There is no evidence that the final alloying and cast- ing of finished products was carried out at this site. The metallurgical installations excavated to date display a variety of types. These include two roast- ing furnaces (one rock-cut and one stone-built) and at least three different types of smelting furnaces: one twin-chambered and single ones constructed either freestanding or with a substructure. Furnace 8 proved to be two separate furnaces, one on top of another. The lower one dates to Cypro-Archaic II; the upper one, Classical in date, was the most com- pletely preserved example found at the site, and is related to an adjacent contemporary slag heap and platform. Based on the dimensions of this furnace, the excavators estimate that the copper output of one furnace was about 38 kg, within the 30-40 kg range others have estimated for the production of a copper oxhide ingot and very close to the size of an ingot known from Late Bronze Age Enkomi. Estimates of the total amount of copper produced at Almyras range between 600 and 1000 kg- seemingly not a large output for the entire three phases (Cypro- Archaic II, Cypro-Classical, and Late Hellenistic) of production at the site. Fasnacht points out, however, that this copper was much purer than that produced in Cyprus before the Iron Age (thanks to access to new ore bodies reachable only with iron tools) and therefore very highly valued on the international mar- ket for specialized purposes (e.g., artistic, medical). Among the nonmetallurgical finds, a small (3 x 3 m) rock-cut chamber in the center of the site (be- tween the mining and smelting areas) continues to be enigmatic, although there appear to be more such chambers in the eastern part of the site (not yet fully excavated).104 Dating to the Cypro-Archaic, it is among the oldest structures at the site, occupying the eastern part of a horizontal platform also cut into the bedrock. No metallurgical remains were asso- ciated with the chamber, and the few finds that it did contain (including an unusual limestone ram figurine, fig. 24) appear to have been brought there by natural sedimentation rather than intentional de- posit. It does not seem to be a tomb; it contained no cultic finds in situ nor is it similar to any known sanctuaries. It may have been part of the everyday life of the workers (for example, a shelter). The ex- cavators hope that future work on the other cham- bers will help to clarify this structure's purpose. Sev- eral hearths for domestic use and a "furnace" of a type different from the others (perhaps a bread oven) also attest to the everyday lives of the mine workers.

A new Marion- Arsinoe district museum is under construction and expected to open in the summer of 1998. The origins of the Cypriot city-kingdom of Mar- ion remain unclear, but an important settlement seems to have been established in the area at least by the sixth century B.C. Ptolemy I destroyed the city in 312 B.C. and moved the surviving population to Paphos. In 270 B.C. Ptolemy Philadelphus founded a new city, partly on the ruins of its predecessor, and named it for his sister-wife Arsinoe. The earliest coherent architecture found by the Princeton expedition is the sanctuary, apparently dedicated to the Goddess, located on the Peristeries plateau 1 km east of the modern town.106 Finds of Cypro-Geometric III pottery suggest that the area may have been in use already in the eighth century B.C., but the earliest architecture discovered dates to Cypro-Archaic I. At this time a peribolos wall sur- rounded a temenos containing at least one building. This building was cleaned out before being remod- eled into a more complex structure dating to CA II, the sanctuary's heyday. The temenos was also en- larged and now included at least two buildings and an altar. The main building was destroyed by fire toward the end of the sixth century B.C., preserving many objects in situ. Finds include large terracotta figurines, stone statue bases, an iron obelos, a seal, bronze bowls, a bronze strainer, and other small items of precious materials. A subsidiary building along the inside of the peribolos wall contained mainly small terracottas of the "goddess with upraised arms" type. In the sanctuary's final phase (probably Cypro- Classical), a substantial single-roomed structure with deep foundations cut through the previous levels. A massive deposit of pottery, terracotta figurines, and statuettes from a large bothros outside the te- menos corresponds to most of the material found within. The bothros levels range from mixed CG III and CA I at the bottom to CA II at the top, with sculp- ture groups carefully laid over the top. The finds from the bothros not paralleled within the temenos-- such as many crushed murex shells, slag, and ceramic wasters- suggest nearby industrial activity. Expan- sion of the excavated area to the east of the sanctu- ary and south of the bothros has revealed rock-cut and plastered installations of still undetermined pur- pose adjacent to the sanctuary, in a location previ- ously assumed to have been a street. Work in the Classical sanctuary just inside the an- cient city wall to the east and north of the modern town has been directed toward clarifying the details of its plan. Traces of a large and well-built Archaic structure have been found below, covered partly by the later sanctuary main building and partly by the later city wall. The city wall, at least at this location, appears to have been either rapidly constructed or repaired. Imported Greek pottery first appears in the sev- enth century B.C. and increases in the early sixth. Large terracotta statues were common in both the 106 See also J.S.

Tests have been carried out in the area of the large building identified as a Byzantine basilica. Two dis- tinct Roman levels with workshop debris from metal- working were found beneath several phases of an- nexes to the basilica narthex. An ashlar wall used in the earlier of these phases may have originally belonged to a building of the Hellenistic period, as suggested by Hellenistic pottery found in the vicinity. Enlargement of the excavations around the Lusig- nan building found during the first years of the Princeton project revealed a Byzantine church or chapel directly beneath the Lusignan structure. Further excavation of the large Roman building, pre- viously identified beneath the Byzantine levels, was able to date the end of its use to the second century A.D. This building has a peristyle court, paved with concrete and surrounded by fine Ionic columns capped by a cornice of beautifully painted Lesbian leaf-and-dart molding of Neo-Attic style. A large cis- tern containing considerable pottery was found un- der the court. Trials north of the colonnaded court have discov- ered ashlar and mudbrick walls running underneath the Roman building. Fill from within the area en- closed by the walls is all pre-Hellenistic, but evidence is still too scanty to allow firm conclusions about this structure's function or date. In the fall of 1997 an important, large, unlooted chamber tomb was accidently discovered during con- struction near the Polis town cemetery, in the local- ity Ambeli tou Englezou. The Department of Antiqui- ties subsequently undertook rescue excavations and has dated the beginning of the tomb's use to the Late Hellenistic/Early Roman period. Ancient Amathus (French Expedition).'08 The 150th anniversary of the French School of Archaeol- ogy in Athens was celebrated in Cyprus, as well as in Greece and France, in 1997. A traveling exhibition surveying the archaeological projects of the school included a major section on the work of the French School in the ancient city-kingdom and environs of Amathus.'09 The exhibition's stay in Nicosia was ac- companied by a series of lectures about the site at the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation. At the same time, plans for a museum on the site and a formal opening of the site to visitors are proceeding. The first of several guidebooks for the general public has also appeared."0 While limited excavation con- tinues,"' most of the French efforts are now being directed toward publication of their more than 20 years of work at this vast site."2 On the acropolis, Antoine Hermary and Martin Schmid have carried out small-scale tests of the ear- liest use of the area as a sanctuary. In the southeast corner, beneath the Roman temple and north of the broken monumental stone vase still in situ, they found channels, postholes, and other cuttings in the bedrock dating to the Cypro-Archaic period. To the west and apparently contemporary, a rock- cut circular platform, channels, and postholes were found, which the excavators interpret as a sacrificial area associated with a nearby bothros. The princi- pal other recent work on the acropolis was the re- placement of the Early Christian basilica's fine opus sectile pavement, which had been removed in order to facilitate excavation of the underlying levels. The main focus of recent excavation has been additional examination of the city's fortification 107 Cf.

At the southwest gate, Pierre Aupert has found evidence for Archaic construction preceding the ex- tensive Hellenistic defenses in this area near the ancient port. North of the acropolis, he has iden- tified the (badly robbed) north gate and several towers and walls. The architectural sequence is com- plex, and efforts to clarify the chronology continue. At least one of the towers appears to date back to the Archaic period. These earliest defenses were partly incorporated into the succeeding Hellenistic and Roman remodelings. One noteworthy find is an inscription on a block found out of context near the north fortifications.

The Athienou Archaeological Project, under the direction of Michael K. Touma- zou of Davidson College, is a multidisciplinary in- vestigation of the site of Athienou Malloura and the surrounding valley. It is providing new data regard- ing the long-term history and use of rural settlements in central Cyprus that can be compared with large inland centers such as Idalion (supra) and Golgoi and coastal urban sites such as Salamis and Kition (supra).114 Excavations have continued in the severely looted Archaic-Roman rural sanctuary. The entire plan has not yet been revealed, but walls from both early and later structures have been found, with evidence that the sanctuary underwent a major reorganization in the last quarter of the fourth century B.C. The en- closed temenos covered an area of at least 400 m2 in the later phases, very large for a Cypriot sanctu- ary. The abundant finds include much fine, but gen- erally fragmentary, limestone statuary (fig. 25), nu- merous (mostly Cypro-Archaic) terracotta figurines representing such types as warriors, animals, char- iots, and centaurs, (mainly Cypro-Archaic) pottery, and a few bronze and iron artifacts. The artifacts clearly suggest that the sanctuary was dedicated to a male deity: representations of Baal-Hammon, Herakles-Melqart, Apollo, and Pan are identifiable among the statues and figurines. No trace of an Archaic-Hellenistic settlement to be associated with the earlier phases of the sanctu- Fig. 25. Athienou Malloura.

About 80 m east of the sanctuary a large settlement was first established in the Early Roman period (first cen- tury B.C.). Occupation here continued through the Byzantine period, until it was abandoned during the seventh century A.D., the time of Arab raids on Cyprus. The site was resettled in the Late Medieval period, until it was finally abandoned in the late 19th century. The excavators interpret the occupation as a large nucleated settlement, at least partly supported by extensive cultivation of dispersed vineyards, or- chards, and fields in the surrounding valley- a set- tlement pattern that continues into the present. The Venetian period (1489-1571) occupation at Malloura was apparently quite substantial. Excavation 113 See TB. Mitford, "Religious Documents from Roman Cyprus,"JHS 66 (1946) 40-42.

The Athienou Archaeological Project survey of 20 km2 has identified over 30 sites, including prehis- toric lithic workshops, tombs dating from the Cypro- Archaic through the Roman periods, small Classical/Hellenistic habitation sites, and lookout posts utilized from Late Roman through Ottoman times. No evidence for Bronze Age or Geometric oc- cupation has yet been recorded. Kato Paphos Maloutena and Fabrika (Ancient Nea Paphos)."116 Wiktor A. Daszewski of the University of Trier is continuing the excavations of the Polish Archaeological Mission in the area of Maloutena, a wealthy Hellenistic and Roman residential area in the western part of ancient Nea Paphos.17 The fo- cal point of the area is the Villa of Theseus, destined to become one of the principal attractions of the archaeological park now being laid out in Paphos."1 Recent excavations have concentrated on the area south of the Villa of Theseus,'9 where several build- ings have been found that preceded the construction of the villa in the late second century A.D. Additional rooms of the Hellenistic house,12" extending to the east and west, have been explored, producing more fragments of First Pompeian Style painted wall dec- oration and other plastered architectural decoration. An underground cistern was found in one room that may be a washroom or laundry, with a latrine in an adjacent room (fig. 26). The building appears to have been destroyed around the middle of the second cen- tury A.D. To the west lies a Roman structure where a mo- saic of a spear-carrying Aphrodite was found pre- viously. The excavation of additional rooms revealed the badly damaged remains of a bath complex, which was probably constructed in the late second century over, and perhaps reusing some of, the Hellenistic house. East of the Hellenistic house an Early Roman house, also with painted and plastered decoration, has been partially excavated. Several rooms open off two sides of a courtyard; two plastered and painted columns found out of place may have supported a portico on a third side. On the fourth side is a stair- case that spirals upward (three turns are preserved) around the inside of a square shaft (fig. 27). An opening under the staircase leads down to a cistern cut into the bedrock. This house contained storage vessels and tableware of the first and second cen- turies A.D. Trials at the presumed corner of two streets meet- ing near the southeast corner of the Villa of Theseus revealed another large cistern. The 3 m of deposit excavated to date go back to the early second cen- tury B.C., including very rich Hellenistic ceramic ma- terial, lamps, stamped amphora handles, arrowheads, a strigillum, beads, and many coins. The cistern ap- pears to have been sealed in the second half of the first century B.C. An octagonal structure on the northwest periphery of the Villa of Theseus had been explored several years ago and thought to be an Early Roman watch- 15 E.g., Herscher fig. 25. 116 For explanation of"Paphos" site names, see Herscher n. 68. 117 Herscher 282-85.

The octagonal base had a cylindrical superstructure; the excavator estimates that the original height may have exceeded 20 m. The tower appears to be related to Hellenistic pro- totypes known from Egypt: its location on the Pa- phos peninsula would have dominated the coastline. Several stratigraphic tests within the Villa of Theseus have confirmed that it was built partly over earlier Hellenistic buildings during the second half of the second century. The western part of the build- ing was built over an earlier Roman structure of the early first century A.D., in which were found frag- ments of a rare millefiori glass bowl. The earliest Fig. 27.

A few wall frag- ments, built out of alignment with the Hellenistic grid system, may belong to earlier Classical structures. Stratigraphic tests below the House of Aion (ad- jacent to the northeast side of the Villa of Theseus and only partly excavated) revealed six habitation levels beginning with the Late Classical period (in- cluding fragments of Attic red-figure pottery), di- rectly above the bedrock, and ending in the late fourth and fifth centuries A.D. Trial trenches to the east of the excavated part of the house demonstrated that the domestic parts of the building extend into this area. An Australian expedition under the direction of J.R. Green of the University of Sydney began exca- vations in Kato Paphos at the site known as the Fabrika hill in 1995. Located east of the Odeon and Roman forum in the northeastern quarter of the an- cient city, diagonally opposite the harbor, it has long been known as the site of an ancient theater. An in- scription on the upper part of the seating had been noted in the early 20th century and limited excava- tions by Kyriakos Nicolaou in the early 1960s con- firmed that the remains were in fact a theater.121 Facing southwest, the seats are partly cut into the natural rock of the hill, but most of the cavea is sup- ported by an artificial earthen embankment to which stone seats were added. The cavea extended almost 1810, unusual for a theater in this part of the Medi- terranean at the time; estimated seating was at least 8,000. The central stairway and one to the west (fig. 28), approximately 300 apart, have been located, as has the western parados at the entrance to the orchestra. The seating and steps were originally covered in a hard fine plaster over a pebble cement, a durable and waterproof coating that made a better surface than the rather poor natural stone. Except for some fragments of spirally fluted, marble columns, few architectural details have been preserved. Remains of a blocking wall around the orchestra with signs of water wear on the orchestra side and three layers of waterproof cement on the orchestra floor suggest that water spectacles were staged here in the later Roman period. There is evidence for a reconstruction of the build- ing, probably in the Augustan period, following a collapse (perhaps due to the earthquake of 15 B.C.) Fig. 28. Ancient Nea Paphos. Steps of Hellenistic theater at Fabrika. of the upper part of the earlier support wall of the cavea. Seats and other parts of the theater were se- verely robbed beginning in Late Antiquity, making reconstruction of the interior arrangements difficult. The chronology too is still uncertain. The pro- posed date of shortly before 300 B.C. for the initial construction is based on the assumption that a theater would have been necessary very early after the founding of the Ptolemaic capital. The terminal date is also unclear, but there is evidence that the theater was already being quarried for stone by the seventh century A.D. It is also noteworthy that the Australian excavations are finding reasonable quantities of Attic fifth- and fourth-century black- glaze pottery in all parts of the site; while none of it has so far occurred in a meaningful context, it provides significant additional evidence for pre- Hellenistic occupation in Kato Paphos. In addition to its work on the theater, the project has begun to explore an ancient east-west road dis- covered to the south below the theater. The road is well paved with stone blocks and was equipped with a sophisticated drainage system. 121 Some preliminary work was also carried out 10 years ago by the University of Trier: see V. Karageorghis, "Chro- nique des fouilles et d6couvertes arch6ologiques A Chypre en 1987," BCH 112 (1988) 835-36.</page><page sequence="35">1998] ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS 343 Paphos harbor. The Paphos Ancient Harbor Ex- ploration Project, under the direction of Robert L. Hohlfelder of the University of Colorado, Boulder, and John R. Leonard, State University of New York at Buffalo, carried out an additional brief campaign of underwater survey in 1994.122 In 1996 the proj- ect extended its scope of inquiry to include the area of the inner port, which is now dry land. Archae- ological investigations were urgent due to the rapid touristic development and reorganization of Kato Paphos, which had slated the area to become a con- crete parking lot for use by visitors to the new archae- ological park.123 Underwater work was limited to the filming of the submerged harbor remains for a planned documentary on ancient Mediterranean harbors. A program of geological core sampling was used to try to ascertain the extent and sedimentary his- tory of the ancient inner harbor basin.124 The work focused primarily on the open low-lying flat area believed to be the western part of the basin; the east- ern part has already been heavily developed. Four- teen complete cores were obtained, all of which reached bedrock. The results of the sampling confirm, as previously postulated, that the Hellenistic and Roman harbor basin extended inland as far as the present ridge line on the seaward side of the road to the mosaics. This ridge is also in line with parts of what has been thought to be a Roman seawall that had been found in the 1980s.125 In addition, bulldozing for the park- ing lot construction in 1995 had revealed several areas of stone paving, including what may be the edge of one of the internal quays previously postulated by the project codirectors. Only one core could be taken in the eastern area, but it indicates that the eastern part of the ancient harbor was distinctly different from the western. It appears to have been a shallow, muddy area, even until fairly recent times. The western part of the har- bor was subjected to higher waves and stronger cur- rents. The geology suggests that the eastern harbor may have silted up and become unusable before the western. Several core samples also produced evidence that the ancient sea level was above the modern one, pos- sibly an indication of seismic uplift of the harbor area since Hellenistic and Roman times. This would help corroborate the report of Oliverus Scholasticus (1222) that the harbor of Paphos "dried up" follow- ing a large earthquake, perhaps one of a series of seismic events that had gradually altered the Paph- ian coastline. For additional discoveries relating to the Archaic and Classical periods, see the entries for "Prastio Ayios Savvas tis Karonos Monastery" and "Kouklia (An- cient Palaepaphos)." ROMAN, BYZANTINE Excavations throughout the island continue to demonstrate that Late Antiquity was one of the most populous and prosperous periods in the history of Cyprus. Most obvious in the luxury and high cultural level of the great cities such as Nea Paphos and Curium, the standards of the time have also become apparent in areas that previously would have been assumed to be "backwaters." A major contribution is the first of a two-volume final report on one of those backwaters, the most remote and unexplored part of Cyprus:J. Fejfer ed., Ancient Akamas I: Settlement and Environment (Aarhus 1995).126 The results of a Danish interdisciplinary project (1989-1994), this volume describes the his- tory and development of the Akamas peninsula dur- ing the Roman and Early Byzantine periods based on fieldwork, literary and cartographic sources, pre- vious exploration in the Akamas region, and studies of the physical environment.127 Of special interest are a detailed study of the Roman road system (greatly facilitated by the lack of development in this area), a full report on the nearby anchorage at Kioni, and results of radiocarbon dating of ancient mortar.128 Another book of importance to Roman Cyprus 122 Herscher 284-85.

Recent work has concentrated on the western part of the site, where the Roman forum and a nymphaeum/bath complex have been identified. As the plan and features of the nymphaeum/public bath complex have been more fully revealed, it is clear that it is an impressive and monumental pub- lic building (fig. 29). It was constructed in several stages, beginning in the first half of the first century A.D., and was destroyed, presumably by earthquake, in the second half of the fourth century. Parts of what is identified as a gymnasium have been found adjoin- ing the bath complex. Additional exploration south of the colonnaded stoa found previously has helped clarify the layout of the Roman forum, east of the nymphaeum. It had a large rectangular and sloping open courtyard paved with limestone slabs, and apparently was enclosed by stoas on all four sides. This area was destroyed at the same time as the nymphaeum complex in the fourth century. The earliest remains found to date on the acropolis consist of two large walls, dated to the middle of the Cypro-Classical period, part of what seems to be an early public building in the northwest part of the site.1"" In excavations since 1993 below the acropolis near 29 C.

Ancient Kourion. Early Christian basilica near the sea. the sea, Christou has uncovered a three-aisled Early Christian basilica, dating to the early sixth century (fig. 30). The church has three apses and three aisles separated by marble colonnades. Basilicas are also known near the harbors of Salamis, Amathus, and Nea Paphos. New excavations in the necropolis of Kourion,just below the cliffs of the acropolis, were undertaken at the request of Christou in 1995 by Danielle A. Parks, under the sponsorship of CAARI.132 The area being explored is part of a much larger necropolis that extends to the north around the acropolis and to the south down into the plain past the church of Ayios Ermoyenis, across the modern Limassol- Paphos road and into the hills west of the village of Episkopi. The cemetery begins just outside the eastern gate of Kourion, with tombs lining the sides of the road toward Amathus. Although Cesnola's ac- count is rather vague, it is believed that he dug some tombs in the area in 1873. Both cist and chamber tombs were already visible before the new system- atic work began. Due to erosion and human activity in the area, little deposit or stratification is preserved. The aim of the project was thus to clarify the layout and or- ganization of the cemetery (fig. 31) and define its relationship to other elements of the city of Kourion. Excavation of individual tombs was accompanied by mapping a more extensive part of the site. The first phase of the necropolis appears to date to the Hellenistic and Roman periods, continuing at least into the early third century A.D. During this time the cemetery consisted of a series of contiguous chamber tombs, each with one or more rooms. Their side and rear walls were lined with rock-cut arcoso- lia, each equipped with a rock-cut pillow; some also were equipped with libation pipes. Cuttings for fun- erary stelae have been noted above some of the tombs, and several cippi, tomb markers typical of Ro- man Cyprus, have also been found on the site. As was expected, finds were very scarce and fragmen- tary, but they include parts of glass and clay unguen- taria and a Late Hellenistic brazier attachment with a plastically rendered satyr mask. This first phase was followed by an episode of in- tensive stone quarrying. The roofs and inner walls of the chamber tombs were removed, and the floors were lowered as stone was taken away. The excavator proposes that this activity may have been connected with the need for extensive reconstruction in the city of Kourion following the late fourth century A.D. earthquake, an event well attested in other parts of the site. In its final phase, the necropolis saw extensive use 132 For a preliminary report of the first season and sum- mary of previous work at the site, see D.A.

These simple rock-cut graves included a headrest at one end and were normally encircled by channels, an unusual feature in Cypriot Late Roman tombs. One was equipped with a libation pipe; the shallow shafts would originally have been covered by lids. Signifi- cant quantities of human bones were found (unar- ticulated, with one exception), providing clear evi- dence that the tombs were used for multiple burials. A few small finds had escaped previous excavators or looters, most notably a pair of gold earrings with emerald pendants of Late Roman type, a pair of am- ethyst pendants of a type known in the seventh cen- tury A.D., and two stray Archaic figurines. A Late Roman or Byzantine date (late fourth/fifth century or later), based mainly on the numerous lamps, is suggested for this phase of use. The regularity of the tombs in each period sug- gests that they were the work of professional tomb- cutters. The discovery of two "blanks"- cist tombs that were outlined but never completed - appears to sup- port this conclusion. Kouklia (Ancient Palaepaphos).' 33Recent excava- tion of the Swiss-German Archaeological Mission, directed by FG. Maier and M.-L. von Wartburg and sponsored by the German Archaeological Institute and the University of Zurich, has concentrated on the Roman phase of the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Palaepaphos in order to clarify its architectural history.134 Previous work had demonstrated that the Roman building complex was erected in the late first or early second century, following damage from an earth- quake that occurred in A.D. 76/7. Further investiga- tion of the North Hall, a cultic banqueting hall with a raised podium around a central mosaic floor, was facilitated by the removal of the pavement of the old (modern) village road. Changes to the drainage system of the hall suggest that the present unremark- able mosaic floor was a reconstruction or replace- ment. Traces of deposits from the Augustan period found lying on the bedrock in some parts of the site indicate that the reconstruction of the north part of the sanctuary replaced earlier Roman sanctuary buildings, perhaps built after the earthquake of 19 B.C. 133 For topographical nomenclature, see supra n. 116. 134 Herscher 287-88.

Another large Roman building with mosaic floors was found to the north of the street that formed the northern boundary of the Roman-period sanctuary. Pottery of the fifth and sixth centuries filled the drain in the street and demonstrates that the area was still inhabited long after the sanctuary went out of use following the final suppression of pagan cults by the emperor Theodosius in 391. Remains of a glass- making workshop date from this period. The Swiss-German mission has carried out a series of small-scale tests in order to date the large walls and other building remains to the south of the North Hall. Three of the walls proved to be Roman, the others medieval. The large stone venerated until fairly recently as the cult place of the Panayia Galaktar- iotissa (which is assumed to have been originally part of the Late Bronze Age sanctuary) was thought by the British excavators of 1888 to form the southwest- ern corner of the so-called "North Stoa" of the Ro- man period. Excavations beneath the stone, however, have now proven that it was put into its present posi- tion no earlier than the 18th or 19th century. Much evidence exists, including numerous pits in the bed- rock, for both medieval and modern intensive activ- ity at the site. Among the recent finds are a marble column base, the first evidence for marble architecture at the site, and a statue base of reddish marble with a partly preserved inscription, probably of Hellenistic date, referring to a "gymnasiarchos" (the third epigraphic text from Paphos to use this term). At the request of the Department of Antiquities, the Swiss-German mission carried out a rescue ex- cavation in 1994 at the locality known as Mantissa, just outside Kouklia village, where the road was being widened. They found house walls dating to the fourth century B.C., further confirmation that the Mantissa area- as well as the adjoining localities of Asproyi and Evreti - were densely inhabited in the Late Classical period. Kato Paphos Toumballos (Ancient Nea Paphos)."35 The Italian expedition, directed by Filippo Guidice of the University of Catania, has continued excava- tions at Kato Paphos Toumballos (also known as the "Garrison's Camp"), in the northwest part of ancient Nea Paphos near the city walls.136 The site in the past has been associated with the cult of Apollo Hy- lates, although no definitive confirmation of this identification has yet been recovered. The work of the project has been concentrated in two areas: the long entranceway (dromos) and stair- way leading to the subterranean chambers, where a mosaic floor was found previously; and in the nearby small Early Christian basilica. As was discov- ered in previous seasons, after the underground pa- gan sanctuary went out of use at the end of the fourth/beginning of the fifth century, the dromos was reused in late antiquity for the installation of 135 See also the entry above for "Kato Paphos Maloutena and Fabrika." 136 Herscher 288.

Early Christian basilica adjoining subterranean chambers. new structures that abutted its northern wall and destroyed most of its southern one. Cut stone blocks from the earlier sanctuary and dromos were reused in these structures, which appear to have been used into the seventh century. Several soundings have been dug in the dromos to examine these structures and clarify their plan. One room in the dromos that has been completely excavated measures 7.6 x 3.6 m and was paved with small pebbles. A large cistern, with a medieval plate at its bottom, has also been found. Artifacts include large amphoras and basins. East of the room with the mosaic, below the later pavement, were several pits cut into the bedrock. It has been suggested that these are votive pits dating to the original period of use of the sanctuary. Continued excavation of the small two-apsed ba- silica (fig. 33) has revealed stone basins and paved floors. To the north of the central nave are two lat- eral areas at a level higher than the nave. The un- usual north-south orientation of the basilica appears to be due to the need to avoid intruding on the ear- lier underground sanctuary. The excavator has pro- posed that the basilica may have been dedicated to St. Hilarion, who is said to have miraculously preached in a pagan temple at Paphos in the late fourth century. Ancient Amathus (Department of Antiquities).'37 Pavlos Flourentzos of the Department of Antiquities has continued his annual excavations in the lower city of ancient Amathus, west of the Roman forum in the area known as Palea Lemesos. Here he has been revealing a large public building complex (fig. 34) that was destroyed in the seventh century. Several complete rooms have now been excavated and the external walls of the building have been lo- cated on the southern, northern, and probably west- ern sides. In situ finds from within the complex include hearths, a bathtub, cooking vessels, an am- phora with the incised monogram of the emperor Heraclius, and columns and other stone architectural fragments reused as seats. A large quantity of pot- tery, mainly Roman and Early Byzantine, came from the building; a number of sherds bore the mono- grams of the Byzantine emperors Heraclius and Her- aclonas. Other finds include copper coins, stone and clay loomweights, terracottas, lamps, small ivory ar- tifacts, a unique bronze amulet depicting St. Deme- 137 See also the entry for "Ancient Amathus (French Ex- pedition)." In 1991 the Department of Antiquities also carried out extensive clearing in the eastern necropolis of Amathus (just north of the small church of Ayia Var- vara), in anticipation of an archaeological park being planned for Amathus. Some of the results of this reexam- ination have now been published: E. Prokopiou, "Ajta0oivTa. AvaTo)tKil vEKP6nokl.

A large bothros within the complex was found filled with plain ware, mainly amphoras. To the north of the nearby forum, an ancient tunnel or crypt was discovered during construction of the Limassol sewage system. A large deposit of figurines found inside dates to the Early Hellenistic period, ca. 300 B.C. Subsequent tests in the vicinity were unsuccessful in locating the tunnel's entrance (which must be further to the north), but did encoun- ter other structures, including a room of the Roman period with fragments of painted wall decoration and Greek and Latin graffiti. This room appears to date to before the fourth-century earthquakes. Maroni Petrera. The Maroni Valley Survey Project (supra), directed by Sturt W. Manning, completed the rescue excavation of the seventh-century basil- ican church at Maroni Petrera in 1994.13" Soundings revealed the existence of an earlier church beneath the seventh-century structure. Peyia Ayios Yeoryios. Charalambos Bakirtzis, of the University of Thessaloniki, has continued his annual excavations of the Early Christian site of Ayios Yeor- yios near Peyia, in far western Cyprus at Cape Drep- anon.139 Considerable information regarding the plan and function of the extensive ecclesiastical com- plex, gradually abandoned in the seventh century, has now been recovered. In the area between Basilica A and the baths, ex- cavation of the open courtyard was completed. A drain to carry water away from the baths ended in a cistern at the southwest corner of the court. Further exploration revealed that the lower part of the cis- tern was actually the stepped dromos of a large rock- cut Roman chamber tomb, which had been reused as a drainage tank for the baths of the Early Chris- tian period. The furnace of the baths has semicir- cular niches on either side of its flue, in which metal containers would have been placed for heating water, a feature known from later Byzantine baths. Finds from this area included a metal brooch or buckle with a heraldic design of animals and birds, many clay and glass containers, and utensils typical of Pa- phos in the sixth and seventh centuries. The large secular building to the west of Basilica A had two stories of rooms arranged around a cen- tral open court, the upper floor accessible via two staircases leading from the court. Its east wing joins the west side of the baptistry complex of Basilica A, and a stairway found in the interior northwest corner of the baptistry suggests that the upper floor of the secular building also communicated directly with the baptistry. The rooms of the lower floor ap- 138 Herscher 291. A preliminary report of the first two seasons has appeared: Manning et al.

Because of this building's large size, central position, and direct com- munication with the basilica, the excavator interprets it as a "bishopric." In the area of Basilica C, the excavation of the outbuildings on the northeast side and the narrow passage communicating with them was completed. Eleven rooms were found, some apparently liturgi- cal and others secular in function. The largest room communicated with the high altar of the basilica and seems to have served as a diaconicon. Another room, with a pebble floor, contained an olive press instal- lation along with stone troughs, a perforated pithos, and an imported marbleJustinianic capital (fig. 35). Two roads were discovered enclosing the Basilica C complex from the north and south and connecting it to the adjacent settlement. Pyla Koutsopetria. Maria Hadjicosti of the Depart- ment of Antiquities conducted trial excavations at the Early Christian site of Pyla Koutsopetria in 1993 and 1997. The large and apparently wealthy coastal settlement here, north of the Larnaca-Dhekalia road on the west boundary of the British Sovereign Base area, has been known since 1961. Deep cultivation in recent years had exposed important architectural remains on the surface. The excavations have revealed part of a large build- ing complex, believed by Hadjicosti to be a basilica. In the area explored, large dressed rectangular sand- stone blocks, smaller limestone boulders, and gyp- sum were used in the wall construction. The walls were plastered with gypsum, and imported marble plaques covered the lower parts of the walls in some places. The presence of many iron nails suggests the extensive use of wood in the construction. Parts of three large rectangular rooms have been excavated. Room 1, the most complete, had a wide entrance in the middle of its west side and its ceiling was supported by a double arch and wooden beams (the impressions of which were preserved on the floor). The arch had collapsed in the center of the room, along with large pieces of cement floor that had probably fallen from a second story (fig. 36). Other architectural fragments and features were also found in the room. These include gypsum frag- ments with rich incised and brightly painted dec- oration, and four unique plaster window panels sealed by gypsum slabs (the sealing of the windows suggests that the building underwent reconstruction or a change of use in its last phase). The base of the arch was decorated with incised Christian symbols (animals and birds on ships, crosses); other decora- tive motifs found on architectural fragments include floral designs, quatrefoils, scale patterns, and other symbols. Among the small finds are coins of the fifth through first half of the seventh centuries. In the eastern part of the settlement, about 100 m from the modern shoreline, similar buildings have been identified adjacent to a fortification tower. The settlement appears to have been violently destroyed around the middle of the seventh century, perhaps during the first Arab raids on Cyprus.

MEDIEVAL While a comprehensive survey of research on the medieval period is beyond the scope of this article, the expanded investigations into the cane sugar in- dustry are worthy of mention. Another important project under way is the restoration of the Venetian walls of Nicosia, one of the best examples in the world of a late 16th-century fortified city. Built in 1570, with a circumference of 4.8 km, the walls re- main virtually intact. A bicommunal project of the Nicosia Master Plan under the auspices of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), a complete photogrammetric survey of the walls has been com- pleted. The restoration is being carried out by the Department of Antiquities of the Republic of Cy- prus, the Municipality of Nicosia, and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. The attention ofnonspecialist readers should also be drawn to several recent publications on the me- dieval period.

In addition to descriptions and historical background of the monuments, the book includes reference material and short essays on topics such as coinage and pottery. A number of scholars have contributed papers to a volume on Cyprus and the Crusades, edited by Nich- olas Coureas and Jonathan Riley-Smith (Nicosia 1996), the outcome of a conference sponsored by the Cyprus Research Centre and the Society for the Study of the Crusades and the Latin East, held in September 1994. Topics include military history, east- ern Mediterranean politics, the Lusignan dynasty, economics, and art of the period. Entertaining to read as well as a useful resource is a new edition of the travel journal of Vasyl Hryhorovy' Bars'kyj, a Russian monk (1701-1747) who spent most of his life wandering in the Near East and making notes of his observations.140 The detailed account with drawings he made, especially of monasteries, churches, icons, and religious life, during four visits to Cyprus between 1726 and 1736, form an important source for Late Byzantine studies. As an Orthodox believer who became a monk, Bars'kyj had a different perspective than, for exam- ple, contemporary English travelers, who were out- siders and motivated by nostalgia for the classical past. Grishin's new translation includes commentary and reproductions of Bars'kyj's drawings. Episkopi Serayia. Marina Ieronymidou of the De- partment of Antiquities is continuing her excavations at the medieval sugar mill complex at the locality Serayia in the village of Episkopi, once part of the estates of the Venetian Cornaro family.141 The principal activity has been in the furnace area on the south side of the site, where the liquid cane juice was boiled in large copper cauldrons. Expansion of the excavated area has revealed a fourth furnace room in the row of furnaces found previously. Of the same double-hearth structure as the others,'42 this appears to be the final room at the west end of the series. Next to it, two thick walls form what ap- pears to be the northwest corner of the boiling area, which measures 24.7 m in length (east-west) and 9-10 m wide. Kolossi sugar mill. In 1994 Marina leronymidou expanded her investigations of medieval sugar mills in Cyprus to include that on the grounds of Kolossi castle, along with those at Episkopi Serayia and Kouk- lia Stavros one of the three most important produc- tion centers for this major Cypriot export of the period.143 One of the best-known and most-visited sites on the island, Kolossi lies east of the Kouris River, on the opposite side from Episkopi.

Kolossi. View of the medieval sugar mill looking south. iskopi are well documented in 14th-century history. The contiguous sugar estates of the two commercial rivals frequently competed for the same water supply. Several structures that have long been visible on the grounds of the Kolossi castle traditionally have been associated with the sugar industry, but their exact functions and organization had not been understood. The new excavations have identified the actual mill (fig. 37), consisting of two main rooms and three small subsidiary rooms, at the south end of the well-preserved medieval aqueduct; the north- ern main room abuts directly onto the aqueduct. A large vaulted subterranean chamber, very similar to the underground chamber of the Kouklia Stavros sugar mill, was found beneath this main room.144 A large wooden horizontal wheel, which used water power from the aqueduct to turn the millstones in the chamber above, was housed in this chamber. A large portion of the wooden wheel was recovered from the debris in the lower chamber, and the spout of the aqueduct's pressure channel has also been found. A staircase, partly rock-cut and partly built, leads from the second (southern) main room to the underground chamber. Clearing of the subterranean chamber exposed a later raised construction with two smaller iron wheels and two bronze accessories for the wheels in situ. Apparently the medieval sugar mill was reused during the Ottoman or even the beginning of the British period, perhaps as a flour mill or an olive press. Finds from within the chamber consisted of a large number of clay tobacco pipes, mostly dated to the Ottoman period, a few coins, and a marble plaque with two coats of arms in relief, which ap- pear to be those of Louis de Magnac, who built the present castle in the mid-15th century. South of the mill buildings, within the large, well- preserved vaulted building, soundings have revealed the remains of two furnaces with their entrances (fig. 38). They are located near the east wall with blind arches of the vaulted building. Ieronymidou now be- lieves that the blind arches originally formed the ex- terior wall of the sugar refinery's boiling furnaces.

DISCOVERIES OUTSIDE CYPRUS It seems appropriate to conclude this survey of fieldwork by mentioning briefly several current archaeological projects beyond the borders of Cy- prus that have major implications for Cypriot studies. All three provide new data of fundamental impor- tance for interpretations of Cyprus's role in the east- ern Mediterranean in the Late Bronze Age. Chronologically earliest are the excavations of Manfred Bietak at Tell el-Dab'a (ancient Avaris) in the eastern Nile delta, where the date and quantity of the Cypriot material are remarkable.145 The ear- liest Cypriot finds from the site date (in terms of Cypriot chronology) to the very end of the Middle Cypriot/beginning of the Late Cypriot period (ca. 1600 B.C.), a time when major changes are attested in Cypriot society on the island. Dated by the excavators to the late 14th century B.C., the Uluburun shipwreck, found off the south- ern coast of Anatolia by the Institute of Nautical Ar- chaeology, contained considerable amounts of Cyp- riot pottery. While the Cypriot finds may be aesthetically and popularly eclipsed by the more spectacular objects from the ship's cargo, they are sufficiently significant that Cemal Pulak has sug- gested that the ship itself may have originated in Cy- prus. In any case, the ship seems to have been a ma- jor participant in the Cypriot copper trade.146 Last is the shipwreck being excavated by the Hel- lenic Institute of Marine Archaeology off Point Iria, on the southern coast of the Argolid, in the Gulf of Argos in the Aegean.147 Dated to ca. 1200 B.C., the ship carried LC IIC/IIIA pottery (among other Mi- noan and Mycenaean types) including at least four Cypriot pithoi with relief bands and two plain white jugs. While it is debatable whether this ship is Cyp- riot in origin, it certainly contained Cypriot cargo and provides firm evidence for Aegean-Cyprus con- tact at this time. 145 M.

HERSCHER, ARCHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS NECROLOGY This survey customarily closes by honoring the memory of scholars who have made important con- tributions to Cypriot archaeology and have recently passed away. Olivier Masson (1923-1997) was a pioneer in the study of the ancient Cypriot language and syllabic writing system. In addition to his fundamental treat- ise on the Cypriot syllabary,148 he published numer- ous studies on a broad range of topics related to Cyp- riot history, religion, archaeology, and philology. Particularly notable among these are his early col- laboration with Maurice Sznycher on an examina- tion of the evidence for the Phoenicians in Cy- prus,149 and numerous epigraphic studies with T.B. Mitford. In 1984 he founded thejournal Centre d'etudes chypriotes: Cahiers (supra), which helps further the prompt publication and dissemination of research related to Cypriot antiquity, and which he edited until his death. Masson's recent research on such 19th- century figures as Luigi Palma di Cesnola and Max Ohnefalsch-Richter has brought to light invaluable documentation for reconstructing their archaeolog- ical enterprises and tracing their widely dispersed finds. Cypriot specialists are also indebted to the work of Jack C. Goodwin (1921-1996). A former foreign service officer and teacher in Cyprus, he wrote nu- merous popular books and articles about the island. For archaeologists, his magnum opus, An Historical Toponymy of Cyprus4 (Nicosia 1984), is the definitive and indispensable source of information on past and present place-names. 3309 CLEVELAND AVENUE, N.W.
