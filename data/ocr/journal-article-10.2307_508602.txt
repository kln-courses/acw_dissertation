The texts are edited from (rotographs of) single MSS., collation with other MSS. being done from Horstmann's edition.1 Miss Allen addresses her edition not, at least primarily, to students of philology, but to " students both of literary history and of religious history," many of whom "will be unacquainted with Middle English "; and these readers are advised to " keep in mind the peculiarities of Scottish and read any doubtful passages aloud." A " simple " glossary (of sixteen pages) is provided, page-references not being given except sporadically. Finally, there are forty-three pages of most valuable Notes, giving, besides explanations of difficulties, information about sources and comments on the subject- matter and on Rolle's style and linguistic peculiarities. It is becoming a commonplace now to congratulate the Clarendon Press on its productions. This is a most attractive little book, bound in dark blue cloth and printed beautifully on excellent paper. W. A. G. D.-D. The Shepherd's Calendar. By EDMUND SPENSER. Complete Works, Vol. III, edited by W. L. Renwick. The Scholartis Press. 1930. Pp. viii+244. 8s. 6d. net. THIS edition of The Shepherd's Calendar forms the third volume of the Complete Works of Spenser, upon which Professor Renwick is engaged. He has here a more interesting text for his commentary than in the earlier volumes, Complaints and Daphnaida; the result leaves us with a faint sense of disappointment. Professor Renwick does not tackle the problem of Spenser's language in The Shepherd's Calendar, the provenance of the dialect forms, the varying linguistic texture so deftly and deliberately handled by the poet. He gives careful attention to the metrical experiments, but leaves the issues confused by following the stereotyped convention of reckoning the line by syllables. Now Spenser at this time was trying experiments with free-moving stress rhythms, and his lines must often be defined, not by numbering the syllables but by stresses. Professor Renwick writes thus of the August Roundelay: " The norm is a verse of eight syllables followed by replies of five and seven alternately, 1 I have noticed only one misprint not noted in the Corrigenda: byne for pyne on p. 46, 1. 6o. On p. xx, 1. 7 from end, a " p" has dropped out. 326</page><page sequence="2">which might make a stanza of 8, 5, 8, 7, cross-rhymed "-surely not a satisfactory description of such lines as these: As the bonilasse passed bye, hey ho bonilasse, She roude at me with glauncing eye, as cleare as the christall glasse: Spenser is experimenting with 4-stress lines, getting variety by an alternate spacing out and hurrying of syllables, and most certainly exploiting the charms of triple, or anapaestic rhythms. Again in the famous April lay, Professor Renwick misses what is the subtlest element in that elaborate metrical triumph, the change from " iambic " to " anapaestic " or triple rhythm in the progress of the poem. We begin regularly enough: Ye dayntye Nymphs, that in this blessed Brooke doe bathe your brest, But the extra syllables begin to play in the third stanza, " Can you well compire "; and by the last stanza we are in full anapaestic swing: Now ryse up Elisa, decked as thou art, in royall aray; And now ye daintie Damsells may depart echeone her way, I feare, I have troubled your troupes to longe: Professor Renwick touches only lightly on the autobiographical evidence in the Shepherd's Calendar. He is vague and general in his remarks about the time and place of its composition. The following dates should be set down in order: February I578. Dr. Young became Bishop of Rochester. In 1578 Spenser was his Secretary. April o1, 1579. E. K. completed his Preface to the Shepherd's Calendar. October i6, 1579. Spenser wrote to Harvey from Leicester House. December 5th, 1579. The Shepherd's Calendar was licensed. The point should be plainly made that Spenser was in all probability at Rochester in the employ of the Bishop when he wrote The Shepherd's Calendar, whose "moral eclogues" reflect (perhaps more fully than is good for the poetry) the ecclesiastical politics of Dr. Young. It is worth pointing out that, among the many allusions to the Kentish countryside, the lines in July : The salt Medway, that trickling stremis adowne the dales of Kent: Till with his elder brother Themis His brackish waues be meynt. REVIEWS 327</page><page sequence="3">R. E. S., VOL. 8, 1932 (N9 31, JULY) have a special local aptness when we think of Spenser at Rochester, where the Medway flows into the Thames. We do not think Professor Renwick establishes his point about the order in which the eclogues were written (Commentary, p. I67); his conjectural order hinges on a shaky assumption, namely, that November, because of its astrological allusion to the Fish, must have been written for February. The lines with their context (November, 11. 9-17) suggest the beginning of the winter rather than the end, and the Fish is probably best explained as a lapse on Spenser's part. If he remembered Chaucer's lines- Now dauncen lusty Venus children dere, For in the Fish hir lady sat ful hye he could not have written But nowe sadde Winter welked hath the day, And Phoebus weary of his yerely taske, Ystabled hath his steedes in lowlye laye, And taken up his ynne in Fishes haske. Moreover E. K. nails Spenser's error to the mast with his note: "the sonne reigneth, that is, in the signe of Pisces all November." We do not agree with Professor Renwick that Spenser is " quite untrue to English scenery, flowers, speech and everything else." Spenser does not over-emphasise the seasonal changes month by month, but he knows his English weather, and he gives us as much as we can stand. In February Cuddie cries: Ah for pittie, wil rancke Winters rage, These bitter blasts neuer ginne tasswage ? The kene cold blowes through my beaten hyde, All as I were through the body gryde. November ends, as it should, with a sullen drizzle: Now gynnes to mizzle, hye we homeward fast. With a descriptive touch here and there-the " cocked hay," the " scarlet berries " of the briar-Spenser assures us of the English countryside, though like all Pastoral poets he allows elements to stray into it from the poetical scenery of his predecessors. Professor Renwick's main work in his commentary is the elucidation of Spenser's and E. K.'s allusions and quotations, and the sketching in of the literary background of the Renaissance behind Spenser's poetic thought and utterance. In this he continues to carry out with scholarly thoroughness and skill a labour which will 328</page><page sequence="4">give his complete edition of Spenser's Works a lasting value, and a secure place on the shelves of scholars. HELEN DARBISHIRE. Marlowe: A Conspectus. By J. M. ROBERTSON. Routledge. I931. Pp. vi+i86. 6s. net. WHEN Mr. Robertson speaks of carrying the " scientific spirit " into our scrutiny of problems of authorship, he apparently does not admit that psychological evidence may be scientific in this sense, or that an estimate of a personality made by its aid may be as strict in its inductions as his own criticism and equally severe in its " concern for testable evidence " in another field. So it comes about that, in this study of the Marlowe canon, we are occasionally reminded of a late humourist's description of a well-attended Sunday service at which only God was left outside; in this thorough and careful examination of evidence for authorship, the only source of evidence that seems to escape notice is human nature. It is upon such grounds as these that a reader may differ from Mr. Robertson upon certain questions of date (such as that of Edward II) and of the canon of Marlowe's works. The main part of the book is a discussion of Marlowe's " hand" and some new theories are advanced in Part II, Chapters II and III, "The Assignable Plays in the Folio " and " Assignable Collaborative Work." The first of these groups includes the Henry VI plays, Richard III, Henry V (part), Julius Ccesar (part), and The Comedy of Errors. The later chapter contains some suggestions perhaps even less anticipated, including the old King John, Alphonsus Emperor of Germany, The Taming of A Shrew, Edward III, A 'Larum for London, and Arden of Feversham, together with the Folio plays, Richard II, Romeo and Juliet, Titus Andronicus and The Merchant of Venice. The chapter on Marlowe's genius and character is full of good points and shrewd estimates, such as the study of Marlowe seems to call out in many of those who discipline themselves to "look through his eyes." The happy application of Pater's phrase, " a hard and gem-like flame," to one aspect of the genius of Marlowe, dwells in the memory. Though in a detailed examination one would question certain statements-the anthropomorphic habit of mind, the lack of religion and the innate chivalry with which Marlowe is REVIEWS 329</page></plain_text>
