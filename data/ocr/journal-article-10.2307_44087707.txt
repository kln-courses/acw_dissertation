<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kathryn St. Ours An Ecocritical Study of The Story of the Weeping Camel The Story of the Weeping Camel (2003) is a narrative documentary1 created by Byambasuren Davaa and Luigi Falorni as the latter's cap- stone project at the Munich Film School where the two met as stu- dents. Davaa had recounted memories of a particularly moving ritual practiced in her native Mongolia to Falorni, who found it equally as inspiring. So the two prepared to spend thirty-five days in the Gobi desert in the hopes of capturing it on film. The ritual that interested them is performed when a mother camel rejects her offspring after childbirth. Since the colt cannot feed, it will never thrive and could perish if the mother cannot be brought to nurse it. Hence, the film- makers needed to arrive in Southern Mongolia in March- when all the camels give birth- and to rely on the arrival of an ill-fated baby camel in order for their film to even exist. Luckily, such a situation arose. The success of the film also depended upon the agreement and cooperation of their hosts. Following up on the advice of the local authorities, the two documentarists met and successfully enlisted a very enthusiastic four-generation family still able to live well in the more fertile part of the Gobi desert. Although this ninety-minute film recounts the events that took place over a twenty-three-day period, it concentrates on the predica- ment of the newborn albino baby and the ritual that resolves it. After several vain attempts on the part of the nomads to reconcile the mother Ingen Temee with her progeny Botok, they finally send the two brothers Dude and Ugna to the nearest settlement (fifty kilo- meters away in Aimak) in search of a musician capable of carrying Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 18.2 (Spring 2011) Advance Access publication June 17, 2011 doi:10.1093/isle/isr045 © The Author(s) 2011.

The ceremony succeeds and life returns to normal, that is to say, almost. The younger boy Ugna's attraction to the more modern lifestyle observed during his trip- ice cream, video games, and especially television- results in the family's purchasing a televi- sion set and the solar panels required to provide the necessary elec- tricity. In this way, the movie also hints at the changing existence of these remaining nomads. The Story of the Weeping Camel is a veritable goldmine for ecocriti- cism. First of all, it is a unique nature/ethnographic account of a people whose ethic of ecological sustainability defines their relation- ship to the land and to one another. Secondly, the film foregrounds the interdependence of a nomadic people and their domesticated animals within the natural environment upon which both rely for survival, while raising the question of the effects of our contemporary technological society on traditional ways of life. Moreover, this work of art posits the ultimate truth-value of rituals involving human and nonhuman animals. The brute reality of the seemingly mythopoeic event caught on camera- the weeping camel and her subsequent acceptance of her colt- allows for a consilient interpretation of the documentary. Consilience, a recent and expanding ecocritical approach, seeks to establish links between various bodies of knowledge in order to provide inter-disciplinarian explanations for phenomena apparently resistant to scientific methods. Up to now, such conceptual unity has involved linkages between the natural and/or physical sciences and the humanities. In Consilience : The Unity of Knowledge , E. O. Wilson affirms that such a worldview implies the existence of universais applicable to human endeavors as well as to terrestrial and cosmic events: "all tangible phenomena, from the birth of stars to the work- ings of social institutions, are based on material processes that are ultimately reducible, however long and tortuous the sequences, to the laws of physics" (266). Often criticized as being reductionist, scholars who share this structuralist mindset prefer to consider it holistic, a way to make sense of the universe in all its brilliant diver- sity. It needs to be stressed from the outset that consilience as used here does not imply determinism, social Darwinism, or racist ideolo- gies at the expense of free will, creativity, chance, or diversity. Others have put forth similar caveats, conceiving of consilience as the search for deep structures that transcend time, space, and discipline, coupled with the belief that the social sciences and the humanities do not escape these resonances any more than the biological and physi- cal sciences do.2 Ecocriticism's claim of interdisciplinarity is alto- gether in keeping therefore with a consilient interpretation of the arts</page><page sequence="3">398 isle and literature, that is to say, one that allows for the fruitful cross- fertilization of diverse areas of research. Specifically, Davaa and Falorni's film will be analyzed here from the agrarianist/pastoralist and consilient points of view, ultimately with a focus on natural laws, not genetics.3 A Cinematic Account of Agrarianism/Pastoralism and Environmental Sustainability From one ecocritical perspective, the cinematic approach used to best document the lived reality of the Gobi desert aliments several significant aspects of a heretofore overly neglected agrarian dis- course.4 Indeed, according to Falorni, the most effective way to capture on film the simplicity of the nomads' day-to-day experience was to adopt an "innocent"5 shooting style, one which would avoid drawing attention to the camera. On the one hand, it was necessary to help the nonprofessional actors forget that they were being filmed. In the reconstructed family scenes therefore, the people were merely told what circumstances or situations were to be reenacted and they went about their business unimpeded and without further instruc- tions. One can assume that the footage shot inside the gets (lodges), in particular, is the result of such narrative reconstruction. In each case- the discussion of the camel's parturition and spuming of her colt, the end-of- workday gatherings or Ugna's bath, for instance- the camera maintains a constant distance and actually gives the spectator an accurate sense of the size of the habitation. These scenes are often punctuated by shots of the ceiling which, in addition to providing yet another idea of the dimensions, signal to the audience that we are indeed inside private living quarters and not on a set inside a studio. For another aspect of Davaa and Falorni's shooting style involves minimizing the spectator's impression of being manipulated; every effort is made to reduce the obtrusiveness of the camera to a minimum. To this end, the film is overwhelmingly composed of sequence shots. A sequence or continuous shot is a relatively long take (five seconds in length on average in this case) with a still camera that encloses the action within the same frame, as though the events were taking place on the stage of a theater. This mise en scène technique privileges continuity over cutting and respects real time and spatial unity. Frequent use of deep focus also allows the spectator to view a scene in the proper perspective, with natural depth percep- tion. Contrariwise, the predominance of montage in a sequence draws attention to the camera and signifies greater tampering with reality: through montage, changes in time, space, and point of view</page><page sequence="4">Ecocritical Study of The Story of the Weeping Camel 399 can be used to shape reality. It is this same desire for neutrality that motivates Davaa and Falorni to generally make the viewers eyes coin- cide with the camera instead of with the eyes of a particular individ- ual. Consequently, the use of shot/countershot is limited: we rarely witness the juxtaposition of a shot of a person and what he/she is looking at. Most of the time, we observe the actions of the people or animals ourselves. Finally, the editing respects the logical chronology of the events filmed and virtually eliminates special effects.6 On the whole, then, the directors' minimally stylized esthetic unites form and content and ultimately contributes to the spectator's knowledge of the nomadic way of life, giving the movie an ethnographic quality. The lifestyle of the nomadic herders is clearly distinct from that of agrarians in the conventional sense; farming and animal husbandry are two distinct if not antagonistic practices. Research carried out in Mongolia over the past two decades has sought to promote the coex- istence of agro-pastoral cultures within the grassland ecology of the region. One such study, "Mongolian nomadic culture and ecological culture: On the ecological reconstruction in the agro-pastoral mosaic zone in Northern China," concludes that the nomadic way of life is closer to ecological practice in the modern sense centered around a reverence for all life, a profound respect for nature and the need for humans to coexist harmoniously with the natural world.7 These ethical principles have much in common with the agrarian credo of the western world. Although not synonymous, agrarianism and pas- toralism do value overlapping traditions that provide alternatives to current ecological pathologies. It will be a matter here of these common sensibilities, including most notably a sense of mystery before nature which breeds humility and respect when using the earth and its resources. Such deference is accompanied by the con- comitant anti-romantic belief that the natural world must not be idealized. Furthermore, the agrarianist/pastoralist ethos upholds the importance of social ties and communitarian values, stemming from the fundamental conviction that nature and the humans who trans- form it are interrelated. From the start The Story of the Weeping Camel communicates an attitude of reverence and humbleness before nature. Indeed, the film's first sequence consists of an establishing shot of the landscape in Southern Mongolia. We therefore see the natural environment in the absence of any inhabitants. Likewise throughout the documen- tary, the sacredness of place is highlighted time and again by means of long panoramic shots of the surrounding scenery: the desert itself, sunrise and sunset, an approaching sandstorm. None of these takes includes people or animals. The environment is presented in and of</page><page sequence="5">400 ISLE itself, stressing the fact that the nomads do not seek to appropriate the land. (This is, of course, by definition, why they have adopted the nomadic way of life.) They seek to live in harmony with nature. The need for a delicate balance is replicated in the landscape shots where the horizon is at the midpoint of the frame, giving equal space to Earth and Sky. The cinematography accurately reflects the compre- hensive worldview and sense of the unity of life held by these people whose agrarianism constitutes "a sustained attempt to live faithfully and responsibly in a world of limits and possibilities" (Wirzba 4). The people's humble existence is founded upon a sense of mystery manifest in their Buddhist/Lamaist belief in transcendent powers that ultimately control nature. This corresponds to what Eric Freyfogle highlights as "the recognition that nature is far bigger than humans, bigger than they know or ever can know (xxiii)." The film presents three rituals (four including the one which will be examined at length later) that illustrate the nomads' spirituality. In the first, the grandmother sprinkles milk in a semi-circle outside the door of the ger. She then recites an invocation. A second (involving the same "holy" liquid) is the christening of the firstborn camel of the season, which, once harnessed in a specially designed bridle, is blessed and baptized. Whereas these rituals are individual or familial, there is a third that is collective. Several families, each bearing a sacrifice of food, unite at an oboo consisting of a heap of stones in the middle of which a post is erected and donned with each family's khadag (blue silk scarf used in sacred ceremonies). Two lamas lead them in a prayer entreating the return of the beneficent spirits- guarantors of the nomads' prosperity. Their words deplore the mistreatment of nature in the wider society and remind all of the importance of its stewardship for future generations. Such behaviors correspond to Wendell Berry's notion of agrarian- ism: not only is existence in the world veiled in mystery and shrouded by sanctity, human beings need to be worthy of such gifts. This is all the more true for "landless peoples who know that the land is invaluable" (27-29) like the Mongolian nomads compelled to nourish and care for the land that supports their lifestyle. Cooperativeness, an equitable division of labor and thriftiness also ensure a sustainable lifestyle for these people. As seen throughout The Story of the Weeping Camel , the four generations occupy separate gers but spend much time together doing chores, eating, conversing, singing, or telling stories. A given individual belongs to a nuclear family, to an extended family, and to the community of families within the same district. What's more, the nomads clearly receive outside visitors with genuine hospitality. All in all, their ethos bears</page><page sequence="6">Ecocritical Study of The Story of the Weeping Camel 401 witness to what Eric Freyfogle calls "the integrity of the human con- dition" (xxi). All facets of life are intertwined: "Work and leisure, the secular and the sacred, the functional and the beautiful, all retain ele- mental integrity" (xxi-xxii). The four generations raise their animals while showing them great affection; milk provides nourishment for the body and the soul; the ger is a habitable lodging well adapted to harsh desert conditions but is beautifully and colorfully decorated inside. This brings us to a second important component of the agrarian/ pastoral ethic: the necessary but sustainable use of nature. Obviously, the form of agrarianism in the case at hand excludes farming and consists of animal husbandry. The cinematography emphasizes the many human activities designed to provide for human needs and desires without doing long-lasting or irreparable harm to the envi- ronment. There are frequent close-ups of hands at work. In addition to those of the great grandfather Janchiv gathering firewood in the opening sequence, we see the grandmother Chimed's hands stoking the fire in the stove or stirring milk as it heats, those of the men plant- ing a post to which the camels can be leashed, or shearing the animal's hair for spinning, braiding, and weaving. The busy hands are caring for their own offspring as well as for the sheep, goats, and camels upon which they depend for survival. Accordingly, the third aspect of agrarianism/pastoralism to be stressed in the movie is the connection between the human and non- human animals. To this end, the film uses a variation in the parallel montage- the analogous scenes are not immediately juxtaposed- to emphasize the similarities between the two. There are, for instance, repeated images of mothers suckling their progeny or of adult animals being fed by the women. The females assume this task and take care of the cooking and serving in corresponding sequences filmed inside the ger. Consequently, numerous shots focus on the relationship between mother and offspring. The young need and want to be near their mothers. The movie allows us to keep track of the development of the firstborn camel- recognizable thanks to its bridle- thriving under its mother's care. She, like her human counter- part, provides physical sustenance as well as a comforting and pro- tective presence. On the contrary, separation provokes discomfort and stress. Ogdoo and Ikhee's little girl Guntee cries bitterly when entrusted to her grandmother Zevel in whose ger she is safely leashed, in stark contrast however to the baby albino camel Botok which, abandoned outright by his mother, has every reason to cry in distress. And we see tears falling from his eyes as from those of Guntee. Each species, Homo sapiens or Bactrian camel, has its own</page><page sequence="7">402 ISLE distinctive language and the soundtrack is replete with the auditory elements of both. (And unless the spectator understands Mongolian, the human language is as hermetic as the nonhuman.) And what about communication between the two species? In retrospect, the scene in which Ogdoo rocks Guntee to sleep to the tune of a lullaby constitutes another significant parallelism intended to illustrate the similarity between the animals and their owners, which reaches a climax during the hoos ritual resorted to in an effort to reconcile through music the estranged camels whose story is the raison d'etre of the film. Ritual, by definition, prescribes that a fixed series of acts be under- taken on the part of participants who may also require particular accessories in the performance of their roles. A native musician expert on the morin khuur is key for the hoos ritual. This is a tradi- tional two-stringed instrument that exalts the horse, an animal much valued by the Mongolian people. The strings and the bow are made of horsehair and the top of the pegboard is in the shape of a horse's head. Once the instrument has been properly tuned, the family's khadag is attached to the top of the fingerboard in order to suspend the violin over the camel's front hump. As the wind passes through the sound box of the instrument, the first musical tones resonate in the otherwise silent surroundings. A few moments later, the musician reclaims his fiddle and begins playing. It is a slow, stringent melody simultaneously intoned by Ogdoo. Standing beside the mother camel, she gently strokes the animal while singing in earnest. The woman's throat is her instrument and her voice and the morin khuur enter into perfect consonance. Their music is another form of touch and one of the many melodies of the Mongol repertoire, called the long song. The singer modulates her voice while holding each sylla- ble for a prolonged duration. (In this case, she is repeating the letters H-O-O-S.) In the end- after five or six hours according to Falorni- the tears of the mother camel Ingen Temee, the object of the cere- mony, signal her receptivity and it comes to no surprise that she from that point forward accepts to nurture her colt Botok. Consilience and the Agrarian/Pastoral Ethos Nature as magical, our instinctive bond with other animals, the fundamentality of the maternal-filial relationship, in short, a sense of awe inspired by the spectacle of life have undoubtedly contributed to the worldwide success of The Story of the Weeping Camel.8 We can rightfully praise and enjoy the film on this basis, and even come away with a heightened sense of our responsibility to protect the</page><page sequence="8">Ecocritical Study of The Story of the Weeping Camel 403 natural environment, globally as well as locally. But should an emo- tional response to the movie necessarily preclude a more scientifically oriented one? Ought one to acquiesce to Wendell Berry's assailment on consilience in Life is a Miracle as the unacceptable and dangerous attempt to reduce the mystery and miracle of life to something that can be figured out and inevitably to enslave it (7-9), to allow the par- ticular to be absorbed by the general (39)? While it lies beyond the scope of this study to examine the pros and cons of faith (be it ecclesiastical or scientific), the view that consi- lience results in reductionism and desacralization is relevant to the analysis of The Story of the Weeding Camel. To begin with, the univer- sal laws that consilience seeks to establish do not signify uniformity. Physical laws, like gravity, inertia, or thermodynamics, become mani- fest in a virtually infinite and wondrous variety of ways in the organic and inorganic realms. Secondly, a careful reading of Wilson's conclusion to Consilience , entitled "To what end?" helps to dispel the threat of a disenchantment of nature.9 On the contrary, science can be re-enchanted by the arts/humanities just as the humanities/arts can be enriched by science;10 the fundamental questions of existence will be best addressed, claims Wilson, by "progressively arranging them into domains of inquiry that unite the best of science and the human- ities at each level of organization in turn" (269). Indeed, the percep- tion of our-selves and our universe continues to change so as to diminish binary opposites (human-animal, spiritual-material, male- female, organic-inorganic, subjectivity-objectivity). One might even argue that the current devaluation of the liberal arts as outdated and irrelevant might be reversed thanks to increased interdisciplinarity. Bearing all this in mind, let us initially refrain from construing the camel's tears as the expression of emotion; it is necessary to avoid "romanticizing" these crying eyes. The film itself discourages anthro- pomorphization. Although The Story of the Weeping Camel undeniably elicits sentimentality concerning the plight of the mother and baby camel and a feeling of attachment for the family, this does not consti- tute a romanticization of nature. The story arises after all because of a difficulty with the herd. Moreover, the film's temptation to romanti- cize the nomadic way-of-life is tempered by the people's obvious attraction to certain aspects of modernity. If agrarianism seeks to reevaluate materialism and consumerism (Major 66), the parents' acquiescence to their son's wish for a television sidesteps such an ideal. In a like manner, our analysis seeks to elucidate the mystery without diminishing all sense of wonder and humility before the healing phenomenon, thereby making consilience compatible with the agrarian/pastoral ethic just discussed. Freyfogle insists for his part</page><page sequence="9">404 ISLE that agrarians do not seek "to restore some Golden Age (which never existed)" and that agrarianism is neither anti-science nor anti-market (xxxv). Norman Wirzba is another ecocritic who underscores the dangers of romanticization as a form of provincialism or close- mindedness (8-9). In his critical review of The Literary Animal : Evolution and the Nature of Narrative, Steven Pinker takes the critique of romanticization further, claiming that art, too, needs to be evaluated in terms of its truth-value and for critics to investigate causes not effects: "It's not that these questions are necessarily unanswerable, but they do need answers, and the answers cannot simply repeat what we already know about people's tendency to produce and consume works of art" (171). Literature, music, dance, and art would not be such wide- spread phenomena merely by virtue of the enjoyment provided or some singularly humanistic determinants (not to mention the music and dance of nonhuman animals). Indeed, a consilient approach tends to erase the boundary between nature and culture with a view to creating a common groundwork of explanation for both. Scientific inquiry into the animal's receptivity and our human sensitivity to the event does not diminish the power of music. Instead, it can contribute to making music fundamental to our wellbeing and as such, an inte- gral part of a balanced and healthy education. A consilient inquiry might first be used to explain the universal appeal of The Story of the Weeping Camel. Can it help to explain such sensitivity to the story? More specifically, might the human imagination be affected by the same universal rhythms to which Ingen Temee responds, namely, those that govern our fictions and in the case at hand, our nonfictions? In his 1978 essay entitled Le Champ des Signes, Roger Caillois cites the well-known fable of the Pied Piper and the musician's ability to plunge the rats into the sea, and in a more ancient version, to lead the children of Hamlin into the depths of a mountain- the realm of rocks and minerals (49-52). The same theorist also recalls the myths of Amphion, who incites stones by means of his lyre to rise and construct the walls of Thebes, as well as that of the sacred trumpets of Joshua's soldiers that brought down the ramparts of Jericho (57), as fables about the effect of sound on the inert. Are these merely aberrant analogies establishing continuity between the behavior of rocks, camels, and humans when exposed to the vibrations and cadences of music? Caillois's musings, on the contrary, prove suggestive of correspondences between mind and matter, rocks and humans, the organic and the inorganic, much in keeping with the consilient approach in ecocriticism.</page><page sequence="10">Ecocritical Study of The Story of the Weeping Camel 405 Although proving such a hypothesis requires scientific research only in its infancy, a case can be made for the adaptive advantages of what heretofore appeared to be nothing more than nonvital pleasure-enhancers of the human condition. In the specific instance of the Mongolian nomads, considered to be an especially musical culture, a vast repertoire of music types has been developed over two millennia. Might such a musical existence have been selected for? Music could be considered adaptive in the sense that it promotes a sense of harmony and equilibrium within the collectivity that depends on cooperation and the division of labor for its survival. Such is, at least, the standard pseudo-scientific explanation.11 In the specific case of the hoos ritual, it is true that the ceremony provides for the nomads' survival by ensuring the growth of the herd. But is it possible to conceive of the camel's sensitivity to the hoos ritual as a Darwinian adaptation? Clearly, to deny a priori that the animal shares with its keepers an emotional response to music runs counter to many ecocritics's condemnation of anthropocentrism. On the con- trary, "from a purely biological point of view, it would be a biological miracle if humans were the only animals to feel," write Jeffrey Moussaieff and Susan McCarthy in When Elephants Weep (16). Needless to say, such feelings do not necessarily presume conscious awareness; "self-awareness need not be all or nothing" (182). In Animal Minds , Chapter 1, entitled "Animal Mentality," Donald Griffin reviews research indicative of the cognitive revolution that has been occurring over the past thirty years in the field of animal psychology. Indeed, the term "cognition" now often refers to an adaptive behavior of which an animal need not be consciously aware. In other words, cognition is a matter of neurological connections, even in the absence of the subject's awareness of the cause/effect rela- tionship between particular stimuli or contexts and their resultant behaviors. In order to effectively adapt to a novel situation, for instance, an animal need not know why stimulus-response relation- ships exist (8). The same might be said of the effectiveness of the ritual practiced by the Mongolian nomads. The singularity of their way of life includes beliefs difficult to encompass from our Western perspective, which more often than not seeks scientific explanations. Music, Biology, and Beyond The response of Ingen Temee to the music is as we have seen two-fold. First of all, she weeps; then she accepts her colt. Now tears, the scientists tell us, fall into three basic types: continuous tears keep the eyes moist; reflex tears rid the eyes of a foreign particle or irritant;</page><page sequence="11">406 ISLE emotional tears manifest joy, pain, excitement, anger (Masson and McCarthy 104-05). The authors of When Elephants Weep provide evi- dence that animals do feel, and the tears of seals, elephants, dogs, and gorillas, for example, have been documented (101-09). Nevertheless, it is impossible to prove what sort of tears is being pro- duced. The same is true of our mother camel. In any event, crying, be it reflexive or emotional, is caused mechanically- as a physical response to a stimulus and in both cases, tears are functional. In Crying: The Mystery of Tears, William Frey studies the phenomenon amongst humans. This researcher in bio- chemistry presents in the chapter entitled "Do Animals Shed Emotional Tears?" what he considers anecdotal evidence of the emo- tional crying of nonhuman animals. In the end, he finds it inconclu- sive and concludes that their (rare) tears are very seldom linked to emotional stress (147). Here again, though, it is important not to equate "emotional" with "self-aware." We know for certain that non- human animals suffer from stress, in which case the tears observed have an excretory function: they help to eliminate harmful substances that threaten health and wellbeing. Frey highlights the research per- formed on aquatic birds, which are known to cry out excess salt after having absorbed excessive and dangerous quantities of it (11-13). Other research on the chemical components of tears also supports the theory that crying helps to recover homeostasis. Although more work on animal tears is required, one has reason to believe that the sur- vival value of tears is the result of natural selection. In order to pursue our discussion of the camel's weeping as gen- otypie (passed on by inheritance through the genome), we turn to current research in the area of neuroscience. Many researchers have been exploring the ways in which animals (and especially mammals whose brains and perceptual abilities are homologous to ours) react to music. The overriding assumption underlying such research considers musical sensitivity to be a reflection of "the ancestral ability of our mammalian brain to transmit and receive basic emotional sounds that can arouse affective feelings which are implicit indicators of evolutional fitness" (Pankseep and Bernatzky 134). It is an obvious fact that many animals are genetically dis- posed to react to species-specific- and instinctual as well as stereo- typed-vocalizations. As far as their reaction to human music is concerned, most of the relevant case studies to date have concen- trated on agricultural or laboratory animals including birds, nonhu- man primates, gerbils, and dolphins. There is evidence that music does in fact promote the wellbeing of nonhuman animals.12 However, even though it stands to reason that camels along with</page><page sequence="12">Ecocritical Study of The Story of the Weeping Camel 40 7 other mammals (including humans) may be sensitive to music, such a hypothesis risks dependence on the empirically nonverifiable and questionable existence of cerebral modules (separate structures within the brain having specific purposes) fundamental to the claims of evolutionary psychology. Under these circumstances, we might do well to study the animal's reaction to music from a phe- notypic rather than a solely genotypie point of view. For the pheno- typic traits, such as behavior, morphology, or physiology, evolve in a given environment and are observable. They can result from a variety of genetic codes, just as a particular genome can produce many phenotypes. As such, the camel's affective response would ultimately be the result of the environment, i.e. thousands of years of domesticated life and exposure to the herd people's songs. Although the process of musical acculturation owing to embedded- ness would depend upon some degree of genetic encoding, genes alone would not account for the behavior. What do we know about Mongolian music? First and foremost, Mongolians use the pentatonic or five-tone scale. As the diatonic scale common in the Western world, it is well formed or maximally even: the intervals between the notes are asymmetric but identical within the octave. Less complicated than its diatonic counterpart, however, the pentatonic scale contains only intervals of whole steps or minor thirds. The minor second (major seventh) and the tritone, which routinely are a source of dissonance used to create tension, are absent, whereas the most consonant interval, the perfect fourth (fifth) is present. No bad pitches, no unrest, only consonance (O'Connell 5). In Cognitive Foundations of Music , Carol Krumhansl affirms the natu- ralness of the cycle of the pentatonic scale inasmuch as it contains five adjacent pitches on the circle of fifths (275). Could the character- istics of the scale somehow facilitate the transcendence of the conflict between the camels Ingen Temee and Botok? What physiological response has brought the mother to tears and how does crying affect her behavior? Can Krumhansl's Cognitive Foundations of Music apply to camels? To investigate the mother camel's behavior further, it becomes nec- essary to extend the consilient approach beyond the limits of biologi- cal laws and to enter the realm of physical laws, for what is music other than "waves of compressions and rarefactions set up by certain vibrating bodies heard as musical tones" (Berstein 5). The brain is a sensitive measuring instrument able to perceive unconsciously ordered relationships between tones. These "sacred ratios" translate universal laws governing the vibratory frequency of sound waves. How do these vibrations affect a particular medium? Cymatics is the</page><page sequence="13">408 ISLE scientific study of wave phenomena developed by Dr. Hans Jenny. By subjecting substances such as sand, water, clay, or various mineral particles spread on a steel plate to the continuous pulse of a crystal sound oscillator, he obtains "sound-forms." These patterns in con- stant motion, known as Chladni figures (first produced by Ernst Chladni, founder of the science of acoustics and the author of Discoveries Concerning the Theory of Music), are geometrically regular and actually make visible the ability of sound to organize matter, that is, to bring order to disorder. For some, to perceive them is to enter into harmony with cosmic rhythms. Musical scales would be in this sense representations of the cosmos able to infuse the listener/hearer with a feeling of oneness with the universe.13 A commentary by John Beaulieu, author of Music and Sound in the Healing Arts (1997), figures prominently as part of the introduction to Cymatics. In reference to the differences between conventional and energetic medicine, Beaulieu, a medical practitioner himself, writes: Metaphorically, our physical body, emotions, and thought processes are like cymatic forms which are organized by underlying vibrational fields. ... In energy medicine, the underlying vibrational field is called an energy field. . . . The practitioner's goal is to use the therapeutic modalities such as music, sound, touch, homéopathies, acupuncture, tuning forks, voice, and color to effect and change the energy field. As the person shifts into resonance with a more coherent field, their array of symptoms may disappear as a more har- monious pattern emerges. (12-13) The animal studies already noted suggest that Beaulieu's remarks might also be applicable to nonhuman mammals. Equally important, his testimony contributes to our ability to view the Mongolian nomads' culture and medical practices as distinctive from yet comple- mentary to our own. Is it any surprise that music has been used in the healing arts in the Far East for centuries and that music therapy in the West has become a viable treatment for maladies such as depression, stroke, physical and mental abuse, or Alzheimer's disease? Conclusion We have tried to push the barrier of the ultimate truth-value of the hoos ceremonial by means of a variation in the consilient approach. That is to say that the camel's reaction to the music may be not only the result of natural selection or environmental conditions</page><page sequence="14">Ecocritical Study of The Story of the Weeping Camel 409 but also a response to universal rhythms. Receptivity to "music" not only transcends species distinction, it is observable as has been noted in the inorganic domain, as well. In this context, Ingen Temee's response to the melody undercuts the anthropomorphic objection and in consonance with the notion of the Romantic archetype, can actually be considered a manifestation of a fundamental bottom-up process that traverses all of nature. In a like manner, our analysis of Davaa and Falorni's narrative documentary has focused in part on consilience by taking account of phenotypic and genotypie traits, environment and genetics, biologi- cal and physical laws, in the hopes of making The Story of the Weeping Camel more than a just-so story. Delightful and magical though it is, the events recounted are not so fanciful as to defy scientific hypothe- sis. Cross-fertilization of disciplines is key to this new and growing critical approach. Our study has also shown how consilience lends itself to ecocriticism. From the practice of an ancient musical ritual to the possible effects of sound waves on the mammalian brain, from the presentation of the values of a rural culture highlighted by a con- scious and purposeful film-shooting style to those of its technological counterpart, the ecological questions raised here include the interre- latedness of humans and nonhumans, the benefits of simplicity and care for the environment and the confrontation between modern and traditional ways of life. In short, we have given a voice to the agrarian ethos within the environmental discourse. In the end, this analysis of the phenomenon that gave rise to the documentary has sought to elucidate the mystery without dispelling it, thereby preserving the aesthetic and spiritual beauty of the film. Far from de-sacralizing the mysteries of life, consilience takes the agrarian values of humility before nature and awareness of the interconnected- ness of all existence to a higher level. A consilient approach focusing on the links between disciplines in the quest for unity is, then, religious according to one of the term's possible etymologies: re-ligare, meaning "to bond fast" or "to make a bond between humans and gods."14 It is a new and growing area of research within ecocriticism that participates in a movement to re-enchant science and to scientize the humanities, a very organicist and ecological vision indeed. Notes 1. A narrative documentary is so-called because of the rather permeable boundary between documentary and narrative film. In a true documentary, there are no reenactments.</page><page sequence="15">410 ISLE 2. Researchers in the area of consilience must not be characterized as socio-biologists. Some take a middle ground between socio-biologists and social constructivists. See Gottschall and Wilson (20-37). Others seek to dispel the fear that consilience implies genetic determinism and the impossi- bility of changing life for the better, like Brian Boyd (Gottschall and Wilson 147-76). 3. The information about Mongolia that follows may be found at www. nationalgeographic.com/weepingcamel and www.discovermongolia.mn. 4. William Major writes that "[although ecocriticism has grown immeas- urably in popularity and stature over the last decade or so, one of the more striking aspects about this burgeoning area of study is just how little atten- tion it has paid to the contributions rural peoples have made to an environ- mental ethos" (51). 5. See Falorni. 6. There is one dissolve used to indicate the passage of time between the birth of the first colt of the season and the last: a relatively deserted landscape fades into another dotted with mother camels and their offspring. 7. See also Li et al. 8. The interested reader will find thirty-two critiques of the film at www. metacritic.com. 9. Given that consilience seeks to explain human cultural products by means of science and scientific theories, it de-romanticizes the fabulous and the marvelous while re-romanticizing them at the same time, for the attempt to account for a seemingly wondrous ritual in terms of a higher order can deepen our awe at the cosmological level. This is an intellectual propensity in many ways analogous to the Naturphilosophie of the German Romantics. For Schiller et al., for example, "The natural world- with its organic types and their vertiginous varieties, its underlying substantial unity and its particular forces- displayed, it was thought, high-ordered patterns" (Richards 10). So when E. O. Wilson forgives Goethe's failings as a scientist, he does not fail to emphasize that the German's purpose of "coupling the souls of the human- ities to the engine of science" was after all quite laudable (36). 10. For a good starting point for understanding the notion of a construc- tive repoetization of science, see Griffin. 11. This is the type of pseudoscience that a collection such as The Literary Animal: Evolution and the Nature of Narrative seeks to combat. In his review of the book, Steven Pinker writes, "I've found that almost everyone connected with the arts (including music, literature, and painting) believes that it is important to show that art is an adaptation, that there is good evidence that art is in fact an adaptation, and that the function of art is some version of bringing the community together. I think all three beliefs are false, and that ultimately they may damage the nascent field. . . . We can immediately see that any supposed function that appeals to the effects we observe post hoc in people won't cut it. Perhaps singing lullabies soothes babies; perhaps dancing relieves tension; perhaps shared stories bond the community. The question is, why would anyone have predicted, a priori, that people would be constituted in such a way that these things would happen? What exactly</page><page sequence="16">Ecocritical Study of The Story of the Weeping Camel 411 is it about a sequence of tones in certain rhythmic and harmonic relations that would lead a baby to ease up on its demands for parental attention (compared to any other signal), and what's in it for the baby?" (169-71). 12. For a samplmg of such studies, see Rikkard et al. 13. Schneider introduces his reader to the interdisciplinarity of mathe- matics, showing the numerous ways in which mathematical archetypes abound in philosophy, art, religion, myth, nature, science, and technology. 14. "Popular etymology among the later ancients (and many modern writers) connects it with religare 'to bind fast' (see rely), via the notion of 'place an obligation on/ or 'bond between humans and gods.'"
