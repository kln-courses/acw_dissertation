Postgate With the generous consent of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago excavations at the site of Abu Salabikh 1 were re-opened in September-December I975 by the British Archaeological Expedition to Iraq, under the writer's direction. It is a pleasure to record here our profound gratitude to Dr. Isa Salman, Director- General of Antiquities, and to all those members of his directorate who made our work possible and assisted us in every way. Special mention must be made of our representatives, Ghassan Azzawi, Ali Hashim, and Abdul-Mejid Muhammad, who never failed to give us all possible help, and of Dr. Abdul-Hadi al-Fouadi, whose assistance as director of excavations in Baghdad was indispensable. The members of the team were Niels Christian Andersen, M.A.A., architect, Dr. P. R. S. Moorey, cataloguer, R. M. C. Shirley, archaeologist, Mr. and Mrs. Jonathan and Kathryn Tubb, photographer and conservator respectively, and Mr. and Mrs. Philip and Adrienne Watson, archaeologists. Mrs. Carolyn Postgate was in charge of the pottery, and Miss Martha Patrick nobly doubled up as child-minder and draughts- woman. All members earned our sincere gratitude for their conscientiousness, and invariably did more than the mere recital of their assigned functions would imply. Grants towards the costs of the excavations were made by the British Academy, the British Museum, Trinity College Cambridge, and the C. H. W. Johns Fund, Cambridge, and to all these institutions we are greatly indebted for their support. Special thanks must go to Professor R. D. Biggs for his continued support and interest, and to him and ProfessorJ. A. Brinkman for their magnanimity in enabling us to proceed unilaterally with what was initially conceived as a joint venture. The writer is also very grateful to Professor D. P. Hansen and Dr. V. E. Crawford for the opportunity of discussing the site with them, and for an invaluable visit to Al-Hiba in I972. This report is intended to give a brief but factual record of the season's main results. Dr. Moorey has kindly contributed a section on the finds, which is especially valuable because of his first-hand knowledge of the material from Kish, and as far as possible his section on pottery is illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8. We hope this may be a useful indication of the major ED III pottery types at the site. Although we have avoided wider issues such as the chronology of the Early Dynastic period, we have not refrained entirely from speculation where it seemed profitable. We feel that assumptions on which decisions may be based during excavation should be made 1 For use in general contexts we have not thought it necessary to retain the diacritical marks of the accurate transcription of the Arabic (i.e. Abui Salabikh) nor the designation Tell, which is not used by the local inhabitants in any case.</page><page sequence="2">I34 J. N. POSTGATE AND P. R. S. MOOREY explicit, even if they cannot be proven, because it is only so that they can be challenged or accepted. The site The site of Abu Salabikh lies some 20 km to the north-west of Nippur, and today is located almost on the eastern limits of cultivation; the northern tip of the main mound is just sliced by a small canal which draws its water from the Euphrates through the Shatt al-Daghara. The site is marked on the Quarter-Inch Sheet No. I-38 V, of March 1942, at 450 3' E, 320 I5' N, as Ishan Abu Salabikh, and its position relative to other ancient sites is best seen in the map of the Akkad Survey recently published by R. McC. Adams.2 Although in 1849 Loftus must have passed very close to Abu Salabikh while travelling between Hilla and Nippur,3 its first notices in archaeological literature result from the " Akkad Survey " in 1956, when it was immediately recognized to be an important Early Dynastic city.4 Subse- quently Professor D. P. Hansen and Dr. V. E. Crawford worked here in I963 and, in consequence of the discovery of an archive of literary, lexical, and administrative tablets of the " Fara " period, again in I965.5 Today the site is best reached by about 2o km of mud track from the ndhiyah of "Somer ", as the village of Jil'ah (Qal'at Sakhlr) on the Shatt al-Daghara has recently been renamed. A village established in the I960's at the south end of the site has now moved a little further away into new houses, and several other villages are also within sight. The mounds themselves are bare of any vegetation at all seasons of the year, like most southern Iraqi sites, and only two features of the surface seem worthy of special comment. First there is the salt, which can be tasted in the dust even when it cannot be seen; after rain the efflorescence of salt makes the mounds appear to be lying under a thin coating of snow, and in some areas this effect is permanent. However, although on the surface the concentration is evidently very high, and the main deposit of tablets in Area E had suffered seriously from this, the lower levels are by no means so badly affected.6 The second feature of the surface is the presence of a good deal of clinker, or waste products from the baking of pottery or conceivably brick. It takes the form of irregularly shaped lumps of clay fired into a vitreous condition, usually with an olive-green tinge, and although it can only have come from a kiln, there do not on first impressions seem to be any particular parts of the site where the clinker is concentrated. It is however a sufficiently conspicuous characteristic to have given its name to the site, for according to more than one informant the word salbukh (plural: saldbikh) refers precisely to such knobbly lumps of clinker. 2 In McG.

To the west of this are two independent tells, the " Uruk Mound ", which seems to have been occupied no later than the Jamdat Nasr period, and the " West Mound" whose sherds are predominantly Early Dynastic, although a few painted Ubaid or early Uruk period sherds have been picked up here. The main Early Dynastic settlement, of some 28 hectares, is on the eastern side of the depression, and is itself divided into a northern and a southern half by a low saddle through which there once flowed a small irrigation channel coming from the far side of the West Mound. The whole complex of mounds is low by Mesopotamian standards, its highest points being in Areas A and E on the north-eastern mound which were excavated in I963. The depression down the centre of the site has been identified as marking an ancient water-course, and this seems entirely probable, although only excavation can prove the point and determine whether it is contemporary with the rest of the site. Apart from the mounds indicated in Fig. i, there are also two almost flat patches further east, where the presence of ancient deposits is betrayed by sherds and heavy salt efflorescence on the surface, and there is probably a further tell belonging with the site just north of the canal. During the I963 season soundings were made in various parts of the site, on the Uruk and the north-eastern mounds. Although with the discovery of tablets the major effort was devoted to Area E, the other high point, Area A, also showed promise, and we began work in both these areas. Area A The site rises relatively steeply in Area A to a high point about 5 m above the surrounding plain, and in I963 one trench was put down the eastern slope of this feature with another at right-angles to it on the southern slope. Although each trench encountered walls almost immediately below the surface, well built and on the identical north-west-south-east alignment, preoccupations elsewhere prevented any substantial work except at the lower end of the trench on the southern slope, where an area of some 4 x 6 m was selected outside the building proper for a stratigraphic sounding. This penetrated some eight levels of occupation and went down about 6 m before reaching virgin soil. At a depth of about 5 m below the surface was a group of four burials with fine grave goods, including a copper mirror, but rather against expectations no remains earlier than Early Dynastic I were encountered.8 If there was Jamdat Nasr or earlier occupation on the east side of the site, it was not here. When we resumed work on Area A three io-m squares were opened where they would bridge the gap between the two earlier trial trenches, and a little work was also done in sI 20 to determine the exact position of walls previously uncovered in 7This plan was prepared by the writer in February 1973 with the support of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq, and we would like to take this opportunity of expressing our gratitude to Nahidh Abdur-Razzaq Daftar for his patient co-operation during the surveying work in un- congenial circumstances. For the contour an arbitrary datum of zero was postulated IO m below the highest point on the Area E dump, and the outmost contour line on the east is at 4- 50 m. 8 See V. E.

At present the main feature of the plan is the long room in sI 21 (Room 4), measuring some 8 *6o x 4 v 70 m. It was entered by a single doorway in its east wall at the south end of the room, and the charred remnants of a door-post were still in situ inside the room, against the wall south of the doorway." Inside the room there lay on the floor a thick deposit of debris mixed with carbonized twigs and other traces of burning, which must have come from the collapse of a smouldering roof. In the north half of the room a length of carbonized beam was found lying approxi- mately parallel to the north wall; it was at least 25 cm in cross-section, and I 25 m of its length was preserved. Probably it was part of one of the transverse roof-beams, although it might also have been a vertical support resting on the floor. Closer to the west wall of the room two rough stone tools and a grindstone may also have fallen together with the roof, since they lay in the debris rather than on the floor of the room itself.'2 Room 5, from which Room 4 was entered, does not have a well plastered floor and a tumble of brick in the doorway slopes down into it; it was probably therefore an open space or courtyard. From here another doorway led north into Room 6 and thence into Room 7, but as this part of the building has been particularly severely cut about by later activity we cannot say anything positive either about these rooms or about those further east, where the slope of the mound brings the floor level right to the surface. North of this again we have found no sign of a doorway connecting with Rooms 2 and 9, and although the cuts permit some uncertainty, it seems probable that these rooms were not accessible from the south at all. It is certain, however, that they too had suffered from a fierce conflagration, since in Room 2 (especially its eastern half in sI I I) the plaster of the walls had been baked hard and to a red-brick colour, and the room was filled with heavily burnt debris including bricks. Lying against the wall between Rooms 2 and 7 there were three clay " feet " * As may be seen on Fig. I we have imposed an arbitrary ioo-m grid on the site, in which each square is identified with a figure and a letter-e.g. 6G-and within these each io-m square is assigned a double figure from oo to 99-e.g. 6G 64. A 2-m baulk is left on the north and west sides of each io-m square, and the remaining 8 X 8 m is excavated in 4 X 4-m quadrants lettered so that the NW quadrant is " a the NE is " b ", the SW " c " and the SE " d". 6G 64d is therefore the SE quadrant of the to-m square lying from 6o to 70 m south and 40 to 50 m east of the gridlines of square 6G. 10 This differs from the 1963 numbering in which the main level is Level I, but since it is not likely that we shall be able to correlate the stratigraphy pre- cisely in the deep sounding, it seemed easier to admit this and adopt a new series of levels which can accommodate the surface remains. Il A pivot-stone (AbS 471) was also found against the wall some 50 cm north of the doorway, but it cannot have supported this actual doorpost. "I Numbered 51 21: 25, 51 21: 26, and 51 21: 31 (objects not catalogued and so assigned an AbS number retain the numbering by square which is given on the site).</page><page sequence="6">I38 J. N.

At the south end near the wall were a conical bowl (AbS 404) and next to it a tortoise-shell which presumably also served as a container (AbS I oo8). Although the north end of Room I is completely cut away, there is a chance that the west baulk of sI xI will provide evidence of the reconstructed east wall of the room. In the eastern side of our building we can therefore recognize the north-west and south-west corners respectively of two courtyard units, possibly interconnected, and at least 25 X I 2 50 m; to the north and south its limits are still untraced, and the eastern side is lost through erosion. We should however note that in the trench dug in I963 in square 5I 02 to our north-east the walls are on the same alignment as ours, and this is also true of the line of another wall which can be seen on the surface after rain in sI 33 to the south, so that the complex of buildings may have extended well beyond the limits of our excavations in at least one phase. To the west the exterior of our building was probably originally the long, though not entirely homogeneous, wall which forms the west wall of Rooms I, 2, 3 and 4. Unfortunately its outer face has been damaged by graves and cuts, but so far as we can judge this wall was slightly thicker than the internal walls of the building, and there may have been some rather irregular buttressing along its exterior.'5 Subsequently more rooms seem to have been added at this side, but apart from the oblong fireplace in the centre of Room I I there are no features in the rooms excavated by us to give a clue to their use. In the absence of any section on which the stratigraphic relationship would show, it must remain uncertain for the time being whether these rooms belong with the main Level II structure or with a later phase, although the latter is on the face of it more likely. Level I Although the pits and graves bear witness to extensive activity in the area, it is only in a few places that we have any clear evidence for a later building level. In 5I I od the north wall of Room 2 is overlain by a circular clay oven with a diameter of 55 cm, and to the south of this oven there were also the very worn traces of mud- brick walling. In sI iId a pottery drain cuts through the line of the south wall of Room 8; it contained much animal bone but no very useful dating evidence, so that we do not know whether this drain, which presupposes the existence of a building, belongs to the same phase as the Level I oven and walling in sI io, or is even later. In sI 2 1, towards the centre of Room 4, the burnt roof debris was sealed by a thin clayey layer (some 35 cm above the Level II floor) in which was a group of 13 See p. 146 and no. 26. lq AbS 398 (a small globular jar) and AbS 312 (a small squat jar) also came from this area, but as they were found at the base of a pit they could have been intrusive. 15 Projections of a kind are found at four points, but in no case is the full width preserved and they are not quite evenly spaced.</page><page sequence="8">140 J. N. POSTGATE AND P. R. S. MOOREY about fifteen post-holes with no very obvious arrangement. This floor, if floor it was, belongs with the same walls as the lower one, and therefore it should be considered a second phase of Level II and not associated with Level I. Graves in Area A The subsequent history of Area A depends in part on our interpretation of the graves and pits which have largely destroyed the Level II walls. While pits and cuts need reflect nothing more than a temporary disruption of the site before rebuilding, the graves imply either that it was deserted for a period, or that burials were made in association with later buildings occupying the site. We believe that the latter is the case, partly because it seems improbable that this obviously important part of the city should have been abandoned to graves during its lifetime, but in particular because of the way in which the graves were made. Although so far we have failed to identify the very top of a burial, we have several instances (both here and in Area E) where the access shaft has survived (e.g. Graves 23, 4I and 50). This shaft is regularly about go x 40 cm and rectangular in shape, and drops vertically to its base, from where it gives on to one or more small chambers in which the burials were accommodated. The depth of shaft found so far is no more than about half a metre, but they were obviously deeper than this, and even those graves where no such shaft was identified may in fact have been reached in this way: this must be the case for Grave 35 in sI 2I c at least, since despite the robber trench which had wrecked one end of it together with Graves 28 and 31, its west end had remained intact and since there was empty space below the floor of Room 4 it had obviously been hollowed out like a cave from the side. The same applies to Grave 26, where most of the pottery recovered came from a cavity under the wall of Room 4, and although it too had been robbed in its eastern half, it seems probable that the shaft marked " Grave 23 ", which was still sealed with a clay lining at its base, was in fact the access shaft for Grave 26.16 It is clear that this type of grave was well suited to intramural burials. The small shaft occupied the minimum of floor space, and perhaps more important displaced the minimum of soil: any archaeologist will appreciate the incentive to reduce as much as possible the amount of earth to be excavated from within a normal-sized room. Intramural burials are known at Abu Salabikh in Area E, and are well attested elsewhere during the Early Dynastic period,17 and there can thus be no objection to the view that these graves were also dug from within the rooms of a building or buildings belonging to a level which has itself now been completely eroded."8 The dating of Area A The only direct diagnostic evidence for the dating of Level II is the upright- handled jar found in situ on the floor of Room 2 (AbS 540; Plate XXVb), which with 16 Although we cannot describe the graves individually, an inventory of Grave 26 is given below (p. 159); see also Plate XXIVc and d. 7 See P. Delougaz, H. D. Hill and S. Lloyd, Private Houses and Graves in the Diyala Region (OIP 88), 58; P. R. S. Moorey, Iraq 28 (1966), 38-9, quoting also E. Schmidt, Museum3Journal 22 (1931), 207. 1R For the presumed complete erosion of a layer from the surface of a mound, compare the conclusions of E.

The same approximate dating must apply to the graves sunk into Level II, which show distinct similarities in their pottery repertoire to the pots from Grave I in Area E, in particular the tall spouted jars and the sets of large bowls with perforated stands.'9 The conclusion seems to be that both the Level II building and the level from which (some at least of) the graves were dug belong to the first half of the ED III period.20 Area A: Summary As to the identity of the Level II Building we do not yet have enough on which to base a guess. The clay " feet " from Room 2 are scarcely sufficient in themselves to hazard a priestly connection, nor is the administrative tablet with personal names at all revealing. From its location on one of the two high points of the site one is naturally inclined to assign some importance to this building, and as far as the plan has been recovered it by no means contradicts this view. On the other hand neither is there any specific confirmation for it, and new results are needed before an opinion could safely be ventured. Area E Like Area A the highest point at Area E rose to about 5 m above plain level and it lies some 250 m further to the south-east. It was here that in I963 and I965 the large collection of Fara-period literary, lexical and administrative tablets was excavated. The earlier excavations all fall within our grid-square 6G, and it will be seen from Fig. I that they began in the central part of an oval mound which runs from 5G for about i6o m south-eastwards into square 6F. Joined to this high area by a shallow saddle is the relatively steep eastern edge of the whole mound, while on the other side it slopes gently away towards the central depression. Despite the delays caused by bad weather and the very fragile condition of the tablets, Professor Hansen was able to recover a considerable portion of an Early Dynastic building in the topmost layers of Area E, and since this has been fully described by him we need only repeat here his main conclusions.2' The most readily identifiable component of the plan (see Fig. 3) is the " burned building " on the north-east, which has a classic courtyard house-plan some 20 x I6 m, complete with a variety of domestic facilities; this was clearly a residential unit. East of this is another group of rooms approached through a buttressed doorway, and called the " southern unit ", a term which we shall retain. This part of the complex was not fully excavated, but the plan of Rooms 29-30, 38- 41, and 43-45 was enough to enable Professor Hansen to point out its "I Two upright handles with pinnate designs and no anthropomorphic features were found in Grave 35 without the jars to which they belonged. They may however be unreliable as a dating criterion since they seem to have been kept in their own right as handles (AbS 751 and 758). 20 This conclusion is neither strengthened nor invalidated by the single fragment of an administra- tive tablet found in a cut from the surface in Room 7 (AbS 1049). Its script is to our eyes perhaps some- what later than that of the administrative tablets from Area E, and for comparison we publish beside it a photograph of the one stratified tablet from the palace at Kish (see Plate XXVIIa and b). 21 As given in IAS, pp. 5-i8.</page><page sequence="10">I42 J.

Between these two main units lies a group of rooms with no very clear function or design, and it was here, especially in Room 3 I, that the majority of the tablets were found; in Room 3' they wcre in a cut which " clearly came from Level I A; however there is no evidence to suggest that it did not post-date Level I A as well ".22 Some tablets were found in a well stratified context: on the I C floor of Room 39 and in the north-west corner of Room 44 " at Level I C, floor 2, on a finely plastered floor of the type one usually associates with temples ".23 Since one of our first objectives was to throw more light on the provenance of the tablets, we began by extending the excavation to the south and east so as to complete the plan of the " southern unit ". As may be seen from Figs. 3 and 4, we have reached the limits of this unit, which now measures some 20 X I5 m, but the entire complex reaches further than we had anticipated, especially to the south, and within the southern unit itself the plan of the building has scarcely benefited because of a great pit of some Io m diameter. As was established by Professor Hansen, three major building phases are to be recognized in the first level of the southern unit, and his numbering of these as I A, I B and I C has been retained. The great pit began at about the level of the present mound surface, cut through the walls of Level I A (this was particularly clear in the south wall of Room 46, cf. Plate XXb), and then dropped almost vertically for more than 2 m, so that at its centre the base of the pit is below the I C floor level and the I C walls are either entirely removed or reduced to a single course of brickwork, as in the case of the north wall of Room 46. Nevertheless, there is some justification for proposing a reconstructed plan much like that in Fig. 3. The line of the south wall of the courtyard (Room 41) is given us by the western jamb of the doorway into Room 44, which was intact at the I C floor level, and the curious lump against the north wall of the courtyard is best explained as the stub of a wall forming its east side, which was also cut by the great pit.24 This then yields a reconstructed plan in which the central courtyard has the same relative size as that in the burned building with its bitumen-plastered walkway (Room 4). Room 39 Room 39, measuring 9 50 x 3-75 m, has been described as the " largest and therefore probably the most important in the southern unit ", and it also displayed some other features of interest. " In the central part of the room at Level I B a large bowl with ring base was set into the floor. At the bottom of the pot was a thick layer of black ash. There were circular red burned areas to the north and south of the pot. A series of post holes (?) without any apparent pattern was found near the firing places. The holes ranged in size from 2 to 5 cm in diameter and were 2 to I 3 cm deep. They all tapered to a point, and most were filled with brown ashy earth. Their use is uncertain ".25 In this part of the room the fill had not been completely excavated 22 IAS, p. ii. '3 IAS, p. 6. 24 Although there was probably a doorway through this wall leading into the courtyard, we have not restored one because its position would depend in part on whether Room 45 was single room or, perhaps more likely, divided by a cross-wall into two. 21 IAS, p.

MOOREY down to the I C floor level, a block having been left against the west wall at a Level I B floor level. One of our first acts at the start of excavations in I975 was to remove this block of earth and so complete the clearance of the room down to the I C floor. Since the lines of the west baulk of 6G 64 bisected the block diagonally, we began by taking down the eastern half and came at once upon two large cuts in the floor of the room, which were later renamed Graves i and 2. Grave r (see Fig. 6) Grave i consisted of a vertical rectangular shaft some 2 6o x i 6o m, placed transversely across the centre of Room 39. It had been dug from the clay floor of the room at about 7 - 75 m above datum, i.e. at the end of phase I C or the beginning of I B, and the base of the shaft is at about 5 oo m. When the packing of the grave shaft had compacted there resulted a depression in the clay floor which had been laid over it, and our cross-section revealed a succession of clay lenses about 30 cm deep, which had obviously been intended to level off the floor above the grave. These lenses showed an alternation of clean clay filling with burnt surfaces, with the burning concentrated at the centre of the grave shaft, and there were at the different levels post-holes with no obvious pattern, exactly like those higher up, described above (see Plate XXIc). Although the pottery bowl containing ash (shown in IAS, pp. 8-9, Figs. 6 and 7) must have been installed after the floor level in the whole room had been raised by as much as 20 cm, it too, like the holes and burnt patches, must be connected in some way with the burial beneath. The deposits in the grave came in three distinct groups, apart from some pieces of copper jewellery loose in the upper fill. Just below the floor which sealed the shaft were the sherds of a round-bellied jar interspersed with three clay " feet " which closely resemble two similar triads found in Room 39 in 1965 (see Plate XXIIa),26 and a saddle-shaped unbaked clay stand. Another separate assemblage had been neatly placed in the northern angle of the shaft about I125 m below the floor: a stemmed dish (AbS 393; Plate XXVa and Fig. 7: 5), a conical bowl (AbS 382; Fig. 8: I2), a small jar (AbS 40I), and a rather unusual globular bowl with a pair of vertical tubular lugs each side (AbS 396; Fig. 8: 20). Associated with these there were also a pair of copper rings and a pair of the cockle shells containing cosmetic paints which are a regular feature of Early Dynastic burials, but otherwise the group stood isolated in the fill. On a mixed layer of sherd and greenish clay at the bottom of the shaft was the burial proper, lying between two clay-lined " shoulders " which were 40-50 cm high and projected some 30 cm from the sides of the shaft. Over the burial and the grave goods a layer of reed matting had been spread, and this was sealed by a further clay lining which merged into the clay of the two " shoulders ". At each end the " shoulders " curve back into the sides and extra space was made for the grave goods by undercutting the ends of the shaft. The arrangement of the grave contents is shown in Fig. 6. Probably the first object to be deposited was the large unshaped 26 For one set of these curiously ungainly objects see IAS, p. i I with Fig. 5; the other set of three also came from Room 39. The discovery of the " feet " mixed up with the sherds of a round-based jar strengthens the case for seeing them as supports for vessels, but it must be confessed that they seem most awkward to use.</page><page sequence="15">EXCAVATIONS AT ABU SALABIKH, I975 I47 LO~. 9 ol~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CU2 (N~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~L &gt;. tv~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ cr- i 0~~~~~~~~ LO~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1</page><page sequence="16">I48 J.

Slabs of this kind were found in other Abu Salabikh graves and are known also from Kish and the Diyala, although their significance is obscure.27 Unfortunately the bones of the skeleton are badly preserved and of a spongey consistency, and in spite of our conservator's efforts to rescue it, the pelvis was probably in no condition for a sex determination even before we started digging. The body had been placed on its left side with the legs flexed and the arms half extended. Next to the hips were a stone pestle and mortar (AbS 8I2 and 52I),28 and behind the head were a stemmed dish (AbS 673; Plate XXVa) and two small jars (AbS 725 and 473). The large, rather elegant jar AbS 536 (Fig. 8: I 5) was lying with its rim to the skeleton's mouth and a large shell was placed in its aperture (AbS 8I3).29 On the left hand were two silver finger-rings (AbS 908 and 912) and there was a single silver ring on a finger of the right hand which was found inside the attractive stone bowl (AbS 705) from which we presume the dead person was supposed to be taking some delicacy. The bones of the head, except for the lower jaw, had decomposed into a pulp, and were mixed with the components of a necklace of lapis lazuli, carnelian, white shell, copper and silver beads. The hair ornaments consisted of a silver roundel by the ear at each side of the head (AbS 9IO and 9II), a hooked silver pin (AbS 892 + 909), two silver spiral ear-rings (AbS 907 and 9I3) and fine silver ribbon which had mostly decomposed to a band of pinkish discoloration (AbS 914). We observed that the skull region rather curiously lay distinctly lower than the rest of the skeleton; a possible explanation of this is that the head had been supported on a pillow or other perishable support which had been let into the floor of the grave but later decayed. No traces of such an object were detected, although remnants of what is probably hair still adhered to the skull. In the southern corner of the grave the handsome upright-handled jar (AbS 472; Plate XXVb and Fig. 7: i) was found half lying with a conical bowl resting in its mouth. Behind and beneath it were two spouted jars, but also the little arrangement of objects shown inset at the bottom left-hand corner of Fig. 6. This included three " cosmetic shells ", nine natural pebbles, a flint blade and a piece of unworked bitumen, as well as two more pebbles and another shell, which were displaced while working behind AbS 472 to remove it. Apart from the double row in which they were laid out (see Plate XXId), there are no features of this interesting little deposit which demand comment, but it is clear that it must have had some significance. The western corner of the grave was also stuffed full with spouted jars, and in front of these, and all over the area of the grave occupied by the skeleton, conical bowls had been placed either singly or in stacks of up to five, predominantly upside down (see Plate XXIIc). 27 P.

The most striking item at this end was however the large ribbed bowl (AbS 65 I) in which were found the sherds of a hollow stand with perforations (AbS 550), a sieve-based bowl (AbS 620), and a small cylindrical mug (AbS 58 I), forming a four-part set (see Plate XXVc and Figs. 8: i6-i 9). In all, the main burial included I I 2 conical bowls and 29 spouted jars.3' The hair ornaments and the complete absence of any weapons suggest that the dead person may have been a woman, but these are not very reliable criteria. Graves 2, 27 and 48 Before we discuss the implications of Grave I we must examine the evidence for other comparable burials both inside and outside Room 39. To the south of Grave i and on the same alignment was Grave 2, which had a similar rectangular shaft, although the regularity of its outline has been destroyed by robber holes. The traces of the robbers were not far to seek; in the fill of this grave were disjointed fragments of human bones, although none were found in place at the bottom of the shaft (at c. 5 * 70 m above datum). They had however left behind a small globular jar (AbS 400) and at the south-west end of the grave was a stemmed dish lacking its base. We were fortunate to find, tucked away into a cavity on the south side, a copper bowl, much crushed (AbS IOO9), a pottery conical bowl (AbS 391) and a well polished conical stone bowl with a neat mend in the rim (AbS 430). The fragment of a literary tablet with a list of place-names (AbS I048) was a chance find in the fill, and may easily have been introduced by the robbers. South of Grave 2 again was Grave 27. At first we had doubts as to its claim to be called a grave at all, but these were allayed in due course by various factors: the shaft was similar to those of Graves I and 2, and at the bottom there were traces of a clay lining and reed matting as in Grave I, while at the north-east end of the shaft was a small group of pottery still in situ (one spouted jar and five conical bowls). Evidently this was also a robbed grave, and here too the robbers had left signs of their presence: rim sherds from a very large pottery bowl were found both in the upper fill of Grave 2 and here, and it is possible that two administrative tablets from here were also introduced at the same time. A heavy copper tool found in the fill could easily have served as a digging implement rather than being part of the grave furnishings (AbS 878). It would be reasonable to surmise that there was yet a fourth grave at the north 30 The bones visible in the photograph are those of the disjointed limbs of an entire mature sheep, but the deposit also included some portions of a much younger animal, probably a year-old goat. Some other graves also contained animal bones, and in the (much disturbed) shaft of Grave 38 were bones of sheep and a young bovid, as well as less substantial fragments of pig and equid bones. I am very much indebted for these species identifications to M. R Jarman. "I All the spouted jars but not all the conical bowls have been indicated on Fig. 6. Dr. R. D. Barnett has kindly called my attention to the remarkable later third millennium grave at Tell Ahmar (Til-Barsib), in which were found " 1045 pieces intactes " of pottery (M. Dunand, in F.

MOOREY end of Room 39, and although no shaft has yet been discerned this could be because of the considerable disturbance in this part of the floor. There is however one other grave which does look as though it belongs in the same series, Grave 48 in the western corner of Courtyard 41. Like the others, it is oriented approximately southwest-northeast with the walls of the building, and it is also similar in size and shape (cf. Fig. 4). Once again the grave must have been robbed, but the unadorned skeleton seems to have escaped disturbance, perhaps because it was accommodated in a shallow secondary shaft sunk in the middle of the main shaft below the grave floor. At the north-east end was a small group of pots, consisting of a jar with ribbed shoulder (AbS 643) and one of the sets of a large bowl, perforated stand, sieve-bowl and mug (AbS 657-660). It is possible that two relatively large fragments of stone bowl from the fill had also belonged to the grave furniture (AbS 672 and 687), but a tablet from the shaft is obviously a stray, and we have no means to decide whether it belonged in the original grave fill or was first introduced during the robbing of the grave (AbS 1044). Graves i, 2, 27 and 48 form a group quite distinct from other graves found by us. They are alike in shape and size, and in their positions within the occupied building; although most if not all of the other burials may have been dug from the house floors too, these floors are now lost and the group of four graves are the only ones identified at this level. If we take account of the stone and copper bowls in Grave 2, which are as fine as any of the Grave i furnishings, it becomes reasonable to assume that Grave i's uniqueness may lie largely in the fortunate chance that it has not been robbed: we should be prepared to admit the possibility that Graves 2, 27 and 48 had once contained a burial comparable to that of Grave i, even if the quantity of pottery was less. It is even conceivable that they might have shared with Grave i evidences of activities over the grave shaft: the patches of burnt clay flooring, the " post holes ", and the large pottery bowl containing ash. It is hard to imagine that these are all simply the results of normal domestic activity, especially since they begin with the very first floor that was laid over the fill of the grave, and we have little hesitation in identifying this area as the place on which ritual offerings were made to the manes of the grave's occupant. As we shall shortly see, this practice is well attested in the written sources, and the apparent uniqueness of the feature is only the natural consequence of the fact that the tops of Mesopotamian graves are much more difficult to recognize than the bottoms. If we now seek to explain the presence of a number of graves of some importance within the walls of a public building, one parallel presents itself which has a number of genuine similarities. This is the gipdrum of the Nanna and Ningal precinct at Ur, a detailed study of which by P. N. Weadock has recently been published.2 Here there were tombs accommodated inside the giparum complex, and although all were robbed we may be fairly sure that they included the graves of the en-priestesses, both because of direct statements in inscriptions that their cemetery was here and because account texts listing offerings issued by the Nanna and Ningal temples mention "butter " (i-nun), cheese and dates offered to the libation-place (ki a-nag) of two of the deceased priestesses.

We do not mean thereby to claim that every detail was the same, but in general this comparison provides the most satisfactory explanation of all the unusual features of Grave I and its surroundings, and we must therefore take it seriously. Indeed, it is by comparison with Ur that we can offer an identification of the " post holes " over the grave. The inscription of Enanedu who rebuilt the Ur gipdrum states (in the translation of P. N. Weadock): " At that time, as for the ' Dining room in which the urinnu-symbols are set up ', the place of the ' fateful day' of the ancient entus, the wall did not reach around its site ".33 From this it emerges that the priestesses' graves were in a room where urinnus or ritual standards were (or should have been) erected, and if our " post holes " were made by the individual pointed ends of such standards it would explain why neither Professor Hansen nor the writer was able to detect any pattern in the holes, such as would have been left by a tripod or four-footed piece of furniture.34 The rest of the southern unit Of the newly excavated rooms in the southern unit so little survived the digging of the great pit described above that there is scarcely anything to be added to what appears on the plans. In Level I C a doorway led eastwards from the south end of Room 39 into Room 46, with the door on the Room 46 side, but this was subse- quently blocked. Everything north of Room 46 had been cut down to below the I C floor level, but the outline of the pit just missed the north-west corner of Room 44 with its western door-jamb, and it was here in I965 that some stratified tablets were found, on a well-plastered floor.35 Traces of this floor, which to our eyes is of an orangey tinge, were noted elsewhere in the building at about the same level, and notably in the south-east corner by the doorway from Room 45 into Room 48.36 This room, if it is worthy of the name, is the only part of the south-east sector of the unit to have escaped the great pit, and it was here, on a level slightly above the orangey floor, that we found a small group of tablets cast carelessly down among fish and animal bones; the fill above them was sealed by another clay flooring (at about 8 *25 m above datum) which showed little more than that this part of the unit was refloored less frequently than Room 39. The tablets themselves (AbS IOo50- o68) are similar in script and content to those from the rest of the building, and although some are small and useless fragments, they do include administrative and literary exercise tablets. It seems to us probable that the major deposit of tablets found in the 83 Iraq 37 (1975), 109; the Sumerian reads: u4-ba und uri ba-an-gub ki u4-nam-tar-ra- en-en-e-ne libir-ra-meg ki-bi bad nu-um-gd (Iraq 13 (I95I), 27-39, 11. 34-6). We find the suggestion of P. N. Weadock (p. II9 12B) to treat the " dining-room " (und) as separate from the cemetery area rather forced; the passage reads as though they were one and the same, and the absence of a copula would be surprising in this text which shows Akkadian influence (e.g. libir-ra-me?). 34 Offerings made over the graves of important persons are well attested for the Ur III period, and include food as well as the libation of liquids; in some cases there were clay pipes to take the libations (on which cf. A. W. Sjoberg, Studies ... Landsberger (AS i6) 63-4). 35 IAS, p. 6. 3S The southern unit seems to have sloped very slightly towards the south, since this floor was at 6 - 9 i m abovc datum in the north corner of Room 4I, at 6 - 88 where the corridor (Room 43) enters Room 45, at 6 - 8o in the side of the Grave i shaft, and at 6- 78 where Room 45 leads into Room 48.</page><page sequence="22">154 J. N. POSTGATE AND P. R. S. MOOREY Room 3I area was originally scattered over the I C floor of the southern unit, bridging the gap between the two groups in Rooms 44 and 48 which were left in situ by the great pit. If so, it means that when, after the I A phase, the unit was at least temporarily abandoned, the diggers of the great pit came upon the tablets mixed up with fish bones, and discarded them unceremoniously into the pits and cuts which " clearly came from Level I A " or later.37 This would account for Professor Biggs' comment that " other stratigraphically early texts . . . if mixed in with the bulk of the tablets would probably not be identified as earlier ",38 and it would fix the southern unit as the provenance of the whole group of tablets and therefore as probably the place where they were stored, if not written. The southern corridor and Rooms 50 and 47 Although the southern unit still emerges as self-contained and accessible only through the buttressed doorway on the west, we now find that a corridor some 3- 25 m wide flanked the south side of the unit and, at certain times at least, gave access to Room 47 on the east. In both these parts of the building the stratigraphy is complex and we intend only to summarize the course of events here without sub- mitting the evidence in detail. The most enduring feature of the corridor (Rooms 49 and 51) is its north wall, which is of course the south wall of the southern unit and with it remained virtually unchanged from Level I C to I A. Against its south face there is a steady accumula- tion of horizontal layers-hardly floors-from the I C floor level to the surface of the mound, but the limit to these layers on the south is very changeable. The earliest I C wall has been located only as a fragment at the base of a deep late pit in the south-west corner of 6G 65, and it was not only cut by the pit itself but had previously been cut down to about 7. 6o m above datum when in the I B phase the south wall of the corridor was rebuilt further in. There was indeed a brief time in which there was no wall at all here, but this need only have been during the process of reconstruc- tion. As the ground level rose in the I B phase a number of small alterations were made to the corridor, including a semi-circular feature and a mud-brick bench against the north wall. Finally the I B walls were cut down and a layer of reed matting laid over them to provide the footing for the I A walls which were distinctly wider (i m or more). The absolute level at which the I A walls were founded varied widely: on the I B wall-stub of Room 46 in 6G 64 the reed matting was at 8 * 30 m, rising to 8 75 further east, while in 6G 66, where the south wall of the corridor is laid half on the I B wall and half on a hard-packed clay footing, the level has dropped as low as 7*32 m above datum. During the I B phase Room 50 was added on the south side of the corridor. Previously this place had served as a domestic quarter, since we found the remains of four ovens here (with diameters up to i m) and extensive ash deposits (see Plate XXc). The floor of the room which was subsequently built here was clean, and gave no indication of its use, nor did we find any clue to the location of the doorway which must have given access to the corridor. Because of a succession of graves and pits very little survives of the north wall of the 37IAS,p. ii. 38 1AS, p. 26.</page><page sequence="23">EXCAVATIONS AT ABU SALABIKH, I975 155 corridor (Room 49) east of the corner of Room 48, and it may be that during the early I B phase there was no wall here at all, the corridor turning north to skirt the east side of the southern unit. However, in the later I B phase the line of this wall was certainly prolonged so as to separate the corridor from Room 47, and the faint traces of a doorway with raised threshold could be made out at about 8 * 2o m above datum. Unfortunately it is impossible to determine the original plan of the building in the Room 47 area because the whole space was cut into at a late date. This is clearest along the wall which separated Room 47 from Room 45 in the southern unit, for this wall was cut on its west face by the great pit, but also on its east face by another similar cut which follows the line of the west and south walls of Room 47. The tip lines in this cut run up to the stub of the west wall, and there interleave with the earliest tip lines in the great pit, so that there can be no doubt of the partial con- temporaneity of the two cuts. Below a certain level the wall-stub prevents an exact matching of the layers, but it seems likely that this Room 47 cut dates like the great pit from after the I A phase of the building, and it is certainly later than I B. The space cleared by the cut was used for a succession of ovens. The earliest was probably let into the ground, and it was surrounded by an oval clay wall, with an arched door to the fuel-chamber facing north-west. The parallel brick partitions of the fuel- chamber are shown on Fig. 4, and above these the floor of the oven proper, which measures 2 * OO X I * 90 m, was formed of rectangular bricks which had been baked red. The remainder had been cut away, and the unofficial nature of this area is emphasized by the way that what survived was allowed to form a hump over which subsequent layers accumulated. Similar kilns are already known from Abu Salabikh (in Rooms 24 and 25) and at other sites.39 Thereafter the Room 47 area continued to house smaller ovens, of which at least three circular versions were found at different levels, and an oblong one at 7 * 90 m above datum, just below the surface; without doubt more had been eroded from the top of the sequence. The wall bounding Room 47 to the east must be the latest feature in the area, since it overlaps, without bonding with, the corridor wall on the south and cuts in half one of the latest of the circular ovens. It must therefore post-date the entire sequence of layers which had built up inside the cut, and the only reason why some of this poorly constructed wall survived for us to find is that there was a drop in the ground to the east, and this wall was cut back into the Room 47 area so as to serve as a revetment or terrace wall. Although none of the deposit in Room 47 can belong to the same phase as the rest of the main building, it is tempting to suggest that when Room 50 was added in the I B phase the domestic activities it displaced were transferred here, and remained here until after the I A phase, but since the I B layers in Room 47 have been entirely cut away, there can be no proof for this. Outside the building At least in phases I A and I B the south wall of the corridor (Room 49) extended through into the north-west corner of square 6G 66 and beyond. Whatever this may imply for the layout of the building-and we hope this may be clarified during our next season-it makes it quite certain that we have here the south-eastern limit of the 3' See D. P. Hansen, IAS, p. 13 with Fig. i9; P. Delougaz, The Temple Oval at Khafdjah (OIP 53), 131-3.</page><page sequence="24">156 J. N. POSTGATE AND P. R. S. MOOREY entire complex. For from the outer face of this wall there drops a mixture of brick tumble and ashy debris which soon disentangles itself into a succession of steeply sloping clayey and loose black ashy striations which reach as far as Io m into the south-east corner of 6G 66 without any sign of flattening out. Apart from some late graves sunk into it at a high level, the contents of this rubbish tip were generally unremarkable. Finds of interest were only a few clay jar-sealings, the bones of a human infant (without grave goods) and, at 5 40 m above datum, the complete skeleton of an onager (see Plate XXIVa).40 This had the peculiar feature that the bones, all still perfectly articulated except in the head region which had obviously been crushed, had been blackened by fire; and since this can obviously have happened only in situ after the decay of the flesh, we presume that it is the effect of hot ashes being thrown on top of the skeleton. In order to establish the depth of this rubbish tip a small sounding in 6G 66d was taken down to water level. This was at I -25 m above datum and virgin soil was identified as a clean flat layer beginning at 2- I0 m (see Fig. 5). From here upwards there is no abrupt change in the stratigraphy although the tilt of the strata is accentuated higher up, and the homogeneity of the deposit is provisionally confirmed by a cursory examination of the pottery, which shows no appreciable changes in even the lowest levels. At present therefore it seems as though the entire rubbish tip from 2 00 to 8 25 m above datum and the tilt of the highest strata indicates that at least another 2 m has been lost from the top by erosion was deposited within the ED III period, and since characteristic ED II pottery is present very little below the I C floor inside the building, the deduction must be that when the floors inside were at approximately 6o50 m, the ground level outside to the south-east was a good 4 m lower, and on at least this side our building must have been an imposing sight. Unfortunately there is no way to achieve a direct stratigraphic connection between the layers of this impressive rubbish tip and the phases of construction within the building, and we can only hope that in one direction or another a less direct liaison will prove possible.4 Earlier phases Apart from random observations made in the sides of deep pits and grave shafts, the only place where we penetrated below the I C floor was in 6G 54c. Once the fill of the great pit, and Grave 48, had been removed, one corner only of the square was taken down to about 5 -I 5 m above datum. This passed through a fairly distinct succession of layered courtyard debris, including one greenish clay layer in which was embedded the base of a tall conical stand (AbS 1042). What was of special interest was that from these layers different shapes of pottery began to appear, in particular sherds from the " pilgrim flasks " which were diagnostic of ED II in the Diyala, but 40 For this identification I am much indebted to Dr. J. Clutton-Brock of the British Museum (Natural History). The identification is on the basis of some of the teeth and one limb, and requires to be con- firmed by further detailed study, particularly in view of the possibility of interbreeding with the ass (Dr. Clutton-Brock has identified an articulated limb from Room 49 Level I B (6G 65: 77) as being probably ass). 41 We pass over the square 6G 74 where the area exposed is hardly sufficient to permit any general conclusions, except that the complex of buildings extended further southwards at this point.</page><page sequence="25">EXCAVATIONS AT ABU SALABIKH, I975 157 not hitherto attested from Kish (see p. i62). Below the base of the shaft of Grave 27 in Room 39 a single conical bowl was turned up which had a height and profile uncharacteristic of the other levels excavated this year (AbS 624). Later phases Apart from the graves, virtually every trace of a building phase later than I A had been eroded away. The only exceptions were in 6G 54, where patches of yellowish dust on the surface betrayed the presence of brick overlying the ashy layers which fill the great pit, and in 6G 65, in the shape of a sectional pottery drain. This "drain ", similar to those well known on other sites, was dug into the centre of Room 49, and was characteristically packed round by sherds which both held it in place and assisted the outflow of the water coming through the perforations in the side of the pottery segments. We did not reach the bottom of the drain, but four segments (averaging 23 cm high and 65 cm in diameter) were excavated, and the sherds from within carefully distinguished from those of the packing which were of course strati- graphically earlier. It was among these numerous packing sherds that some were recovered which differ from any previously found at Abu Salabikh (see Dr. Moorey's comments, p. I62). The implications of these few sherds are rather far-reaching. Let us assume, as seems most plausible, that they belong to the Sargonic period. We must then assume further that the site was sufficiently inhabited at that time to justify the digging (and probably fabrication) of a substantial pottery drain, and for sherds to fall down it. Yet until now there has been no indication that Abu Salabikh was occupied after the Early Dynastic period. Nevertheless, it is evident from the late (ED III B) graves close to the surface in Area E that a considerable deposit of that period has been eroded, and there is no obstacle to thinking that Sargonic or even later building periods could also have disappeared completely as the result of erosion. What is more troubling is the complete failure of our and earlier examinations of the surface to identify any of these sherds, despite the fact that in this and some other squares all the surface sherds were collected and washed. We can only conclude that with the passage of time sherds left to lie on the surface by the erosion of the layers in which they had been preserved were sufficiently affected by the combined action of the weather and the salt to be broken up altogether. Since this conclusion may seem overbold and improbable, we shall have to devote considerable attention in the following seasons to the surface sherds in an effort to find evidence which could substantiate it.42 6G 37 and 38 Between the southern unit and the steep eastern edge of the mound there is a noticeable depression which is at least partly filled by the soft ashy debris of the ash tip in 6G 66 and beyond. Further north this depression is closed by a saddle of higher ground joining the north-east corner of our building, as excavated, to the ridge which 42 Since this conclusion would be particularly distasteful to those engaged in surface survey pro- grammes, we hasten to point out that a similar deduction was made by Schmidt at Fara (see above, p. 140, note i8), where the Ur III occupation of the site is firmly attested by the clay nail of Hala-adda.</page><page sequence="26">158 J. N. POSTGATE AND P. R. S. MOOREY marks the eastern edge of the mound, while north of this again the ridge becomes apparent before fading away into a low-lying area. From the start it has been obvious that this ridge might result from a solid wall enclosing either our building only or a larger area of the city, and to investigate this possibility, and reveal the stratigraphic relationship between the main building and the edge of the mound, we put in two squares in 6G 37 and 38, as shown on the contour plan (Fig. x). In fact our work here, as elsewhere, was held up by the presence of numerous graves, but it may be useful to mention the more interesting results. For the main objective the most relevant feature is a relatively thick wall (c. I 70 m) running rather unexpectedly across 6G 38 from south-west to north-east, but turning south-eastwards more or less where it enters the east baulk of the square. For the present it would be premature to claim that this was part of an enclosure wall, but if it were, it would mean we are close to a gateway or similar feature. In the north-east corner of 6G 38 against the north face of this wall we came upon a simple burial (Grave 52) which contained an early upright-handled jar (AbS 755; Fig. 7. 3), a rounded spouted jar (AbS 870) and a conical bowl (AbS 922); the grave itself is at c. 5 * 85 m above datum, and the surviving top of the wall at 7 * 50 m, but it is hard to see how the wall could have been built without disturbing the burial, so that it may in fact be earlier in date than this (probably ED II) grave. In 6G 38c, not far below the surface and in no usably stratified context, was a small friable red-ware jar which held a hoard of beads and pendants of a variety of materials (see Plate XXVI; Fig. 8: i i; and p. i66). Although these beads were very close to the head of Grave 51 (which contained the stemmed dish AbS 947), they were definitely not a part of it, nor would one expect to find such a hoard among the grave goods. It must therefore have been buried with intent to recover it later. In 6G 37 there is no sign of the I * 70 m wall, which must therefore stop or turn in the baulk, but the plan of a well-built house with carefully plastered walls begins to emerge. However, the need to excavate first the graves cutting into it has so far prevented us from going deep in this square. Graves Excluding the four graves in Rooms 39 and 4I already described, and those in 6G 37 and 38, all those found this season in Area E belong to a phase later than I A. This is reflected in some of the pottery types which are quite foreign to the repertoire of Grave i (and Area A), and unrepresented in the sherds from Levels I A to I C. Although again the level from which these graves were dug has in most cases been completely eroded, and many of them have been robbed, there is enough evidence to show that the majority were of the same type as we found in Area A, with the burial chambers taking off from the base of narrow rectangular shafts. This was particularly clear in 6G 66, where the graves and their shafts, which were filled with clean yellowish clay, had been sunk into the loose black soil of the rubbish tip, but similar vertical shafts were also identified in 6G 65, 6G 55, 6G 74 and 6G 37. In 6G 37 and 38 the graves so far excavated have been too close to the surface or too badly robbed to allow of any general statement, but the repertoire of the pottery in Graves 32 and 5I in particular suggests that they may be intermediate in time between Grave i</page><page sequence="27">EXCAVATIONS AT ABU SALABIKH, I975 I59 and the late burials (e.g. Graves 5 and I5). Except for Grave 37, an adult and child, all the inhumations were of single persons, and the dead were usually laid on their side in a flexed position, often wrapped in matting; in at least three cases we detected traces of textile clothes or wrapping, and in Grave 38, which had been badly robbed, we may have evidence for a wicker bier or coffin. In a report of this kind it is impossible to describe even the most interesting graves in any detail, but we believe it may be helpful to give a comprehensive list of contents for a few typical instances, with emphasis on those illustrated: Grave 26 (Area A), Graves 5 and 14 (6G 66), and Graves 32 and 5i (from 6G 37 and 38).

MOOREY Conclusions Although in the long term it is our hope that we shall be able to study all aspects of the life of the Sumerian city at Abu Salabikh, we make no apology for having concentrated in our first season on the two areas of the north-eastern mound already investigated by Professor Hansen. While the character of Area A is still to be determined, there has been no doubt from the start that the tablets in Area E come from a building of importance, and the paramount interest of the tablets themselves makes it essential to discover as much as possible about their wider context. This can be resolved into two separate questions: what was the building in which they were found, and is Abu Salabikh a city whose fame died with it, or one whose name at least is known to later cuneiform tradition? A precise answer to these questions is only likely to come from the tablets themselves, and it is possible that there are clues in those published by Professor Biggs, especially the administrative ones. This season our attention was particularly caught by an almost complete administrative tablet of nine columns, which was found in the fill of Grave 48 (AbS I 044). This is a list of "subsistence fields " and is totalled as follows: AN:?E:GU / 40-la-2 (bu' r) PAD 'e:GAN / GXN:GfD:IU " Total: 38 bir of subsistence corn-field: the field surveyor Before this we are given a detailed break-down of the allocation of the fields, most entries being for one or two bz'r followed by a personal name, but the first column deserves to be quoted in full: 3 (bu"r) Se:GAN PAD/ nin / 2 (bu r) se:GAN PAD / dsara (LAGAB XSIG7) / 2 (bir) Se:GkN PAD / en5-si " 3 bfir, the lady; 2 buir, the god Shara; 2 bzr, the ensi ". Although the writer is quite prepared to suffer correction from those more inti- mately acquainted with Old Sumerian texts, it seems to him that the most natural interpretation of these entries is that the " lady " or " queen "-who is listed first and is the only one to receive more than 2 bur is a goddess, that Shara is her consort or perhaps some other male relative, and the ensi is the first mortal listed. Granted this, it would naturally-though admittedly not inescapably-follow that the building complex from which this tablet (and similar field allocation texts already published, e.g. IAS nos. 508 and 5I I) originated was the temple of a goddess. This would agree with Professor Hansen's opinion (IAS, p. I8) that our buildings " are probably the residential or administrative dependencies of a temple which is yet to be found in the immediate vicinity of Area E ", and with our more specific proposal that the graves in the southern unit are comparable to those in the gipdrum of Nanna and Ningal at Old Babylonian Ur. We must however hasten to point out that it is virtually the only inscriptional evidence which suggests the identification of the Area E complex with a temple, and more positive evidence is still needed, such as, ideally, the excavation of the temple sanctuary itself. As for our other main question, the identity of the city, the evidence remains even more circuitous. It has been suggested in the past that Abu Salabikh might be the</page><page sequence="29">EXCAVATIONS AT ABU SALABIKH, 1975 i6i site of Kesh (kes), an important Early Dynastic city whose chief deity was Ninhursag.43 However, in a forthcoming note in Sumer, publishing texts from Tell al-Wilayah, we have proposed the identification of this important site with Kesh, and even if this proves mistaken there seems little doubt that Abu Salabikh lies too far to the west. In IAS, p. 24, Professor Biggs mentions as a possibility the city of Eresh (NISABAkl) although he does not discuss it further, and one reason for considering it is the entry lugal ereski in no. 505 Rev. As far as the non-literary occurrences of Eresh go they would agree with this suggestion: Old Akkadian texts from nearby Nippur mention Eresh several times and it is also found twice in Ur III texts."4 There is even a date formula for Sin-muballit, year I5 (RIA II, I78 no. 97) which records the building of the wall of Eresh. The only problem surrounding the identification of Abu Salabikh with this rather shadowy Sumerian city is the chronological one, that to all appearances the site was deserted by the end of the Early Dynastic period, which would contradict the references just quoted. However, even to this the sherds from the drain in 6G 65 may have provided the embryo of a solution by suggesting that appearances are indeed deceptive, and therefore we feel that Eresh may be considered seriously as a candidate for the ancient name of Abu Salabikh.45 PART II: THE OBJECTS by P. R. S. Moorey These concise notes on the objects found this season at Abu Salabikh are entirely based on rapid study in the field. They are only intended to indicate the range and character of the small finds, excluding tablets, in the most general way. With few exceptions they date to Early Dynastic III in accord with Hansen's earlier conclusion that " occupation ceased at the end of Early Dynastic IIIA or shortly thereafter, and the site was never re-occupied ".46 In this rests much of the archaeological and historical interest of the upper levels of the site. If this is to be fully exploited, it is very important that the time (and consequently, if possible, the circumstances) of desertion should be established within as narrow limits as the evidence of the objects allows. In view of the considerable surface erosion, both in Areas A and E, meticulous attention must be paid here, and in future study of surface pottery batches, to any material which might fall outside the Diyala Early Dynastic IIIB/Proto-Imperial range. Pottery in the latest graves, notably Grave 5, indicated that there was still some kind of occupation in Early Dynastic IIIB. For the moment there are no certain signs of those ceramic types taken to be particularly characteristic of Diyala Proto-Imperial.47 43 T.

MOOREY One piece of evidence was, however, equivocal. From the packing of the vertical drain in Room 49 of Area E, cut down from above the highest surviving level of occupation, came sherds from the rims and shoulders ofjars whose distinctive shape and decoration, of incised wavy lines in bands, were in marked contrast to other comparable sherds and much more reminiscent of North Mesopotamian wares presently dated to the final quarter of the third millennium B.C. What seem to be similar jars have been excavated both at Tell al Rimah and Tell Taya 48 and there is comparable decoration on pottery of the Akkadian period in western Luristan.49 As was expected from the earlier excavations pottery batches included sherds from all periods back to Uruk (bevelled-rim bowls), though never in anything like significant quantities-there was for instance only one painted Jamdat Nasr sherd (Area A). Only in two cases were stratigraphically significant pre-ED III ceramics discovered: from Grave 52 and among sherds from the lowest level reached in the courtyard sounding in Area E (6G 54c, at 5 '20 m). The grave contained a small, simple upright-handled jar and a spouted jar with a rounded body profile both more typical in Kish/Diyala terms of ED I/II than of ED 111.50 The courtyard sounding provided the only well-stratified sherds of pilgrim flasks, with neck and handles squarer in profile than published Diyala types; the form has not yet been recorded at Kish. A single, tall conical bowl of ED I/II form was an isolated find below Grave 27 in Room 39 of Area E. An inconsistent note, in view of evidence from other sites, was struck only by the regular, if numerically insignificant, occurrence of solid-footed goblet bases in sherd batches from the upper levels of both Areas A and E. As other typical Diyala ED I sherds were not recognized in the same batches they have for the moment to be regarded as strays with other such typical intruders as baked clay wall-cones and sickles. But it is possible that the typology of these vessels requires fresh appraisal which may reveal certain types still used after ED I. The date range of the cones and sickles may also be longer than is presently assumed. Here, as in the field, the ED III ceramic repertory (almost invariably grave furnishings when restorable) will be reviewed rapidly by comparison with Mackay's published type-series for Cemetery " A " at Kish, both geographically and chronologically the most appropriate, and, as it turned out, the most consistently relevant. It is significant that a cursory inspection of the sherd-strewn surface of Tell Fara identified numerous parallels to the typical sherds of the upper levels of Abu Salabikh; but sadly very little pottery has been published from excavations there. Some of Mackay's categories are too heterogeneous, but will in time be easily modified to suit Abu Salabikh's ED III repertory. Indeed the following comments incorporate certain changes. Fabrics and surface colours are also closely matched at Kish and in the Diyala, presumably conforming to the variations in firing conditions admirably summarized by Matson.51 As the mound's Arabic name implies, there is ample evidence, at least in the erosion levels, for local pottery production.

Type A (Fig. 7: 1-4): the upright-handled jars, following criteria defined by Delougaz 52 were predominantly of Early Dynastic IIIA. Anthropomorphic handles were far rarer than geometrically decorated ones, whilst all incised decoration was made, often very crudely, with a single-pointed tool not with a comb-like instrument (as also in Type B). So far as they may at present be checked stratigraphically at Abu Salabikh Delougaz's arguments for a development from plain geometric to anthropo- morphic handles are well sustained: Grave I yielded a finely made geometric handle; occupational debris on an upper floor in Area A (sI iod) a broken jar with only a nose on an otherwise geometrically decorated handle; and the late Grave 5 a jar with a fully-fledged anthropomorphic handle of the Kish Cemetery " A " type. There was a similar example from Grave 32. There was evidence that anthropo- morphic handles were not invariably female. A unique tiny, hand-made jar had such a handle on which the face had a clearly incised beard (AbS 530) 3; a fragment from the base of another hollow handle, not a miniature this time, seemed also to be incised with a beard. In the badly disturbed Grave 35 there were two geometrically decorated upright handles but no trace of the corresponding jar(s). Type B (Fig. 7: 5-7): the stemmed dishes (" fruit-stands ") ranged from massive, richly decorated examples with diameters up to and over 40 cm down to austerely simple examples as narrow as 7 cm. All were relatively squat. Some stems had one, some two, tall narrow doors, with a square window above, cut into them; in one case this was flanked by incised stylized trees. An outstanding example (AbS 947), lacking its dish, had this cut-out decoration in the stem with a pair of doves(?) in each of two windows and a pair of applique bulls flanking a circular hole pierced in the collar of the stem above each window.54 Type C/L (Fig. 7: 9): jars of the types grouped by Mackay into these two heterogeneous categories were well represented. Incised encircling horizontal bands on the shoulders were regularly encountered in sherd batches, but only on three complete jars from graves. Type D (Fig. 7: 8): spouted jars were more numerous this season in ED IIIA contexts than evidence from Kish and the Diyala might have suggested, though the form typical of this period at Abu Salabikh is known in both regions.55 There were 29 such jars in Grave i. Type E (Fig. 7: io) jars with a high, splayedfoot (" cup-based "), common in Cemetery A at Kish, were encountered only in graves closest to the present surface. Types F, P, R, RA and S (Fig. 8: i6-i9): a fortunate association in certain graves showed that the large bowls, ribbed and unribbed on the outside, the hollow cylindrical stands with rows of small holes pierced in them, small bowls with filter bases (perhaps in one case a conical bowl with a single hole pierced through the base), and tiny, hand-made cylindrical mugs, were sets. It seems that the hollow stand, placed at the centre of the large bowl supported the filter bowl, whilst the tiny mug (in graves at least, if not in use) was set beneath it inside the stand.

MOOREY grouping may now be recognized in grave 87 of Cemetery " A " at Kish, in an ED III grave cut down into room I of the " Plano-Convex Building " in area P at Kish, and among the pottery packed into the " maquette architecturale" from Mari, also ED III.56 No convincing explanation has yet been proposed; production of some relatively liquid food or beverage seems most appropriate to these contexts. Type G (Fig. 8: I4): only fragments of the distinctive large, coarse ware " pans" with characteristic flaps and holes were found; all outside graves as is usual elsewhere."7 They have been said to be braziers or crucibles, but these fragments bore no obvious traces of burning and a role in food production may again be more likely. Types H and J (Fig. 8: 20, 2I): beakers and jars pierced for suspension are not yet significantly represented; there was one complete small, thin-walled bowl with four pierced rim lugs from Grave i, upper group. Type K (Fig. 8: 23): squat jars regularly occurred in groups of 2 or 3 in graves. Type M (Fig. 8: 22): only two complete jars with a single hole in the side of the base were noted. Type N (Fig. 8: i i): " narrow-mouthed "jars were present in the graves. In surface batches there were isolated sherds from thin-walled globular jars with decoration, of orange paint in the best-preserved examples, in narrow encircling bands. What may be a related ware was found at Tell Asmar in houses of the Proto-Imperial period.58 Further parallels at Mari in ED III may indicate a western origin for this style of painted decoration which is different from the red-slipped vessels of local ED II/III tradition.59 The bead hoard (see p. 158) had been concealed in a unique jar of this general type.60 The use of pottery vessels as " jewel-boxes" was noted in the Diyala 61 and there is an ED III example from Kish.62 Type 0 (Fig. 8: i2): the conical bowl was by far the commonest type of pottery both in and out of graves. Type Q (Fig. 8: 13): only a single example of this unusual pottery form was found, in Grave i9 in Area A. It seems, contrary to Mackay's illustration, that they were used with the shallow coarse-ware dish, with pinched lip, upwards and the tall, hollow cavity turned downwards, possibly as a lamp. Mackay noted that they sometimes appeared in pairs. There is an example in the Mari " maquette archi- tecturale ".63 Type S (Fig. 8: i5): of Mackay's " unusual shapes " only the elegant jar with broad rim and concave neck almost as long as the pear-shaped body was represented: in Graves i and 28. The lower part of a tall conical stand, with incised rather than wholly excised triangles in bands round it, was found in Area E below the I C floor level (AbS 1042). 64 66 AM I, P1.

Red-slipped ware, some- times with pattern burnishing, again represented in the fill of Grave I, was not recovered in sufficient quantities to define forms or to establish the exact period of use here. Definitely of ED IIIA was a coarse fabric varying in colour from dark brown to black, with incised geometric patterns origiinally picked out in white. No complete examples were recovered; but a substantial fragment of such a bowl, with tubular lugs, came from Grave 37.65 Relief decoration on pottery was rare: notably a snake on ajar shoulder (AbS 403) 66 and the horns of an animal on a large heavy coarse-ware sherd from a vat (AbS 713). Animal-shaped vessels set on wheels,67 and chariot models, were evident from fragments as in one case only was a model boat (AbS 885). Only a single fragment of a " lid " with moulded decoration on the outer surface was recognized. 68 Various household fittings completed the repertory of large clay objects. Massive sherds of coarse-ware vats and flat slabs were regularly encountered, but so far no complete shapes; very similar fabrics were used for vertical drain segments and tannurs. Horizontal drains were of more finely potted and baked interlocking seg- ments shaped like tall jars.69 There was evidence both in Areas A and E for at least four sets of " tripod feet " very like those found in the Temple Oval at Khafajah.70 Clay figurines of animals, various quadrupeds, were uncommon and usually badly damaged; human figurine fragments were even fewer and crudely made.71 Seals and seal impressions Only five cylinder seals were registered (not including fragments and what may be cylindrical beads with geometric incisions). Four, two of shell, two of marbly limestone (AbS 468; 469; 879; 88o), were cut with rampant animal friezes involving individual human figures typical of ED II/IIIA glyptic elsewhere.72 The fifth (AbS 470), of marbly limestone, from an ED IIIA context, was distinctive and may represent a more localized tradition. The broad flat cutting of the design and the " hour-glass " silhouette of the main male figure recall in glyptic Iranian stamp-seals 73 and in pottery designs painted on " Scarlet Ware ".74 Fifteen separate and legible seal impressions were recorded, but await detailed study. They were usually in debris; in one case in Area A two were closely associated with an administrative tablet fragment. As might be anticipated they range from ED IIIA, not it would seem later, back to the Jamdat Nasr period, the earliest being an " arcade " design of the type sometimes classified with the " Piedmont Jamdat 66 Cf.

MOOREY Nasr Style ".75 A single limestone stamp-seal (AbS 704) came from an ED IIIA context. It has a horizontally-pierced pyramidal back, with frontal view of a chubby-cheeked lion cut on its square base.76 A single Jamdat Nasr stamp-seal (AbS 527) with plain domed back and walking man crudely rendered with a drill on its face, was found out of context. Stone Neither the range of stones nor the stone artefacts were in any way unusual for the period: numerous fragments of grinding stones in volcanic ash or sandstone (sometimes placed in graves); various hammer stones as well as door pivots of water-smoothed pebbles or boulders; a single fragmentary spherical mace-head; and pestles and mortars. Complete stone bowls were rare; the finest, of marbly limestone, from Grave i, had an overhanging lip and a carinated body reminiscent of a metal vessel shape. Stone bowl sherds more often indicated that bowls had either simple incurving sides or straight sides set at an angle to the flat base; more rarely the bowls were oval-shaped with short lip spouts. A number of the stone bowl sherds bore traces of ancient repairs, some with metal wires and rivets. There were no examples of stone statuary or relief; but one tiny fragment of slate from Area A (AbS 850) was part of the setting for a large inlay plaque.77 There was clear evidence for the manufacture of flint tools in ED IIIA, particularly in Area A (51 2IC), where small prismatic blade cores, single-ended, with plain oval striking platforms and variously shaped tips, were directly associated with flakes and blades. The majority of blades were parallel-sided, fine ribbon-blades with small bulbs; the edges were commonly abraded by use as often were those of the irregularly shaped flakes.78 Sickle-blades were numerous, their working edges lustrous and coarsely denticulated. They were usually rectangular, with neatly retouched ends and with denticulation variously on one or both sides. A small number retained traces of their bitumen mounting (see Plate XXVIId). All isolated beads, apart from a very fine elongated biconical carnelian bead from Area A (AbS 5I3), were overshadowed by the hoard from Area E in which, apart from gold and silver, lapis lazuli, carnelian, rock crystal, agate, marble, pink lime- stone, translucent green gypsum, mother-of-pearl, shell and frit were represented. There were no etched carnelian beads but lapis was used for tiny pendants of spread-winged eagles, a bearded bull and a calf couchant, as at Kish and in the Diyala.79 In Grave I4, beneath the skull, was a thick, squat chalky limestone cylinder, the surface much damaged and very dirty. In one end survived part of a copper rod turned at right-angles to the axis of the cylinder as if part of a frame in which the cylinder might have revolved (AbS i oI I i). I know of no parallel for this object, which in appearance, superficially perhaps, recalls cylinder seals of the Uruk If H.

The most unusual stone object otherwise was a pink limestone pendant of a highly stylized bird found on the surface of the Uruk mound (AbS 848). Metal Apart from some tiny beads of sheet gold, personal ornaments of silver and traces of lead wire, all the metalwork was of copper or a copper alloy, generally in poor condition and not very plentiful. As so many graves were disturbed their metal contents may well just have disappeared long ago. Pieces of dross and reject casting fragments suggested some local production. Personal ornaments, in silver and copper, were very similar to those reported from Cemetery A at Kish: spiral hair-rings, finger-rings, discs (" medallions ") and double spiral pendants. The pin types were also comparable, including most notably those with tops cast as horned heads or tanged to take a lapis lazuli or similar bead.80 A single copper cosmetic set (AbS IOI2) is also of Kish A type.8' Grave 26 yielded an oval copper bowl with pinched spout (AbS 87i). Two fish-hooks (AbS 495; IOI3), a harpoon head (Abs 855), a razor-blade (AbS 670), a flat axe with folded socket (AbS 878),82 and a tanged dagger-blade with no midrib and traces of a sheath (AbS 945) were working tools. More ambiguous is an exact sheet metal copy of a typical ED III cast shaft-hole axe-head retaining traces of the wooden shaft (AbS 877).83 Of other materialsfrit was found only as beads; apart from beads and seals there was no worked shell, only cockle shells for cosmetics and a conch shell in Grave I, with innumerable shells and shell fragments; worked bone was equally rare and ivory appeared very rarely as beads or little decorated buttons; bitumen was regularly found as small cakes or stoppers. The most unusual object in this category was a complete tortoise shell lying upside down next to a conical bowl on the floor of Room I in Area A. This reptile is common in Iraq, though rarely represented in ancient art 84 and even less commonly reported from excavations.85 Catalogue of drawn pottery (Figs. 7 and 8) I.
