<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE COAST SALISH OF CANADA' By H. G. BARNETT INTRODUCTION WITH the exception of the Bella Coola, the adjective Canadian defines rather precisely that aspect of Coast Salish culture which provides the basis for this summary. The Puget Sound tribes, though Salish and im- mediately adjoining, are not included in it because of a lack of original information about them and because it is intended that this should be a digest of field data rather than a synthesis of existing material. The limita- tion is therefore an arbitrary one and not founded upon a cultural dis- continuity; in fact there can be no doubt that the transition at the present international boundary was a more gradual one in prehistoric times than that between the Comox and Nanaimo, for example. Specifically the area under consideration lies on both sides of the Strait of Georgia, between Vancouver and Bute Inlet on the mainland, and from Victoria to Salmon River on Vancouver Island. This is a region of extremes in environment and cultural specialization. In part, the latter has been stimulated by the Kwakiutl immediately to the north, themselves in a very similar habitat. For the rest, the Salish have made their own adjustments to a remarkable land and water configuration. The strait nowhere exceeds a breadth of twenty-five miles, and its waters are not subject to the violent storms which occur on the outer coast. A number of large and small islands are scattered just off shore and add to the irregularity of the land pattern. These features create a maximum of sea shore and become a significant factor in the culture-environment relation- ship. An extensive hunting ground emerges at low tide: mollusks and waterfowl abound on the mud flats. A pronounced tidal differential-a variation of well over ten feet is not uncommon-brings this feature into still greater prominence. The islands, natural refuges for man and animal, once harbored numerous birds and even deer. Porpoises were abundant; halibut banks were known on the southern part of Vancouver Island; and every river and creek once literally seethed with salmon in the spawning season. These and other characteristic natural conditions are pertinent to a proper understanding of the cultural accents of this area. Among the Salish, as farther to the north, they have fostered a predominately fishing and sea hunting population. The rich assemblage of aquatic life was ex- 1 Two three month periods were spent in collecting material for an ethnography of these people. The first season, in the summer of 1935, was financed mainly by the Fundusz Kultury Narodowej of Warsaw; funds for further study in 1936 were provided by the Department of Anthropology at the University of California. 118</page><page sequence="2">BARNETT] COAST SALISH OF CANADA 119 ploited to the full, while an almost equally exuberant land fauna played a secondary role in the bill of fare. Protected harbors and inlets ramifying inland further favored the utilization of waterways. On the mainland especially, mountains descend abruptly into the water and are covered as elsewhere with a dense undergrowth topped by heavy stands of conifers. A variety of roots, berries, fibers, and workable timber was derived from these resources, but gainful penetration was difficult and foreign to the genius of the culture. Canoes were therefore indispensable; travel on foot was distinctly the exceptional mode. Habitation sites were almost exclu- sively on rocky beaches at the water's edge. All of the area was ranged over and claimed in one fashion or another. This does not mean that the burden of population was critical: to judge by native accounts there was no want on the subsistence level, nor have I any record of contest over territorial claims. On the mainland at least boundary lines were rather well defined. Occupational sites were of two kinds: permanent villages and temporary summer encampments. At the mouth of every river of any size there was a cluster of plank dwellings. These were the foci, the winter retreats, of semi- sedentary groups who counted and preserved their distinctness by reason of this habit of seasonal convergence. With the coming of spring the in- habitants of each center radiated over its acknowledged territory, setting up shelters at favored spots for clamming, egg gathering, and fishing. These groups are to be regarded as cultural units, homogeneous within themselves and differing to some degree from the others. Strictly speaking they should not be called tribes. Each was composed of from one to five named house clusters, often within shouting distance of one another, to which the term village is here applied. There were, for example, twelve named villages (an unusually large number) on the Cowichan River from Duncan to the mouth of the bay. Aboriginally the whole group, as at Cowichan Bay, had no in- clusive name for itself, no head chief, and no coordinated political structure. Such unity as it achieved was founded upon a community of interests arising from near or remote degrees of kinship between its members, and a common traditional background. Eleven of these ethnic groups have been investigated. (See map, Figure 1, for their location.) There is nothing to suggest an internal source for their names; in almost every case the names seem to have come from an out- sider and are not the names of villages. Minor differences between any two groups are recognizable, but there are certain cultural cleavages which make it impossible to treat the area as a homogeneous one. A division into three sub-areas is indicated by the data.</page><page sequence="3">120 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 40, 1938 The most aberrant group, from the Salish point of view, is that of the Comox proper (Vancouver Island).

Related to them, though not so in- timately as they are to one another, are the Sechelt. Across the Strait, the Nanaimo, Cowichan, and Sanetch are in pronounced cultural agreement, except for a few traits which have filtered around the tip of Vancouver Island from the Nootka. In the same category perhaps should be placed the Point Grey group (Muskwium) and the Squamish. I am uncertain about their classification in terms of the outline given here, for while their social structure fits in well enough with the classification suggested here, their technologies reveal an up-river adaptation. Linguistically the area is divided as follows: To the Comox dialect belong the Pentlatch, Homalco, Klahuse, and Sechelt. The Cowichan and Nanaimo speak another dialect differing only slightly from that of their nearest relatives on the Fraser River as far up as Yale. The Sanetch are most closely connected with the Sooke and Songish around Victoria and the Klallam in Washington. The Squamish are set apart as distinct from the other Salish dialects around them, their nearest affinity being the Nootsack of Washington.2 SUMMARY OF THE CULTURES Salmon, the staple food, were commonly taken by means of weirs, nets, gaffs, and harpoons. Straight shanked hooks and cylindrical basketry traps were not used extensively. The various types of dams and enclosures were constructed of cedar laths and were in use whenever the depth and current of the streams permitted. Harpoons were of the two pronged variety known widely on the Pacific Coast; the detachable head consisting of a simple piercing point bound fast between two wings. They, like the long handled bag net, were operated from platforms standing alone or in connection with dams. Fish netting was commonly made of nettle fiber. Gill nets were known on the southern part of Vancouver Island, but never attained the popu- larity of a distinctive variety of seine. Called a reef net, it was operated between two canoes near the mouths of favorable rivers. Halibut and cod were caught on plain U-shaped hooks of bent hard- wood. They were suspended in pairs and held almost everywhere by hand. Cod were also speared, lured upward by a spinning shuttle-cock device. Rock enclosures, and some of stakes, were so situated that at low tide they would effect the stranding of fish. Remains of these structures are still visible on many of the beaches. 2 Taken chiefly from Edward S. Curtis, The North American Indian (Cambridge Mass., Vol. 9, 1913), pp. 31-32.</page><page sequence="5">122 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 40, 1938 A herring rake-"comb" gives a better idea of the construction of this implement-was swept through waters teeming with these fish to impale them on its sharp teeth. During the spawning season roe was collected on submerged branches. Clams were everywhere a never failing source of food, except at the mouth of the Fraser and to some extent that of the Squamish, and while the epithet "clam-digger" had somewhat the same connotations as our own "peasant," the food itself was a part of the daily fare of every class. They were dug by means of a plain pointed stick (often pointed at both ends) identical with the one used for roots. The hunting of sea mammals was a precarious and exacting pursuit. The common man did not engage in it since it involved certain traditional prerogatives, considerable training, and, at least theoretically, some super- natural sanction by way of a dream. Seals and porpoises were generally approached by canoes manned by two hunters. The man in the bow wielded a large scale replica of the salmon harpoon to which was attached a line and several inflated bladders. The flesh of these animals was a prized delicacy. Their fat was rendered in wooden dishes by means of hot stones and stored, among the Comox, in distended kelp bulbs; over the rest of the area the animal's bladder was used for this purpose. The oil was a relish for dipping dried roe, berries, and roots before eating. Sea lions were also hunted sporadically and similarly utilized; their gut in particular served as cordage. On the Fraser and Squamish Rivers sturgeon took the place of seals. A long shafted harpoon was used to probe the murky water, or a large pocket net was pulled through it between two canoes. Sockeye, scarce elsewhere, were plentiful on the Fraser, olachen (candle fish) ran on the Squamish, but neither of these places afforded opportunity for cod, halibut, or sea mammals. In fact, the people living on these rivers drew a distinction be- tween themselves and the "salt water people," by which they meant mainly those on Vancouver Island. Considerable traffic at one time took place between some of the groups, though there is some reason for doubting the antiquity of such free inter- course. All accounts agree that the West Sanetch had well established fish- ing privileges on Boundary Bay, inside of Point Robert, and regularly re- sorted there in summer; so did the Lummi. The Cowichan and Nanaimo frequently came to a camp on Lulu Island, either to fish for sturgeon and sockeye themselves or to bargain for them with dried clams. The Squamish in summer came out of Howe Sound, in part, it is said, to escape the mos- quitoes. Some camped about Point Robert, others, so another report goes, congregated with the Sechelt and Cowichan at the head of Jervis Inlet.</page><page sequence="6">BARNETTrr] COAST SALISH OF CANADA 123 There may have been some contact with the Lillooet in this direction, as there seem to have been inland connections between the Squamish and Sechelt. In all probability the activities associated with land hunting were more developed in these inland going cultures than among those across the Strait. Certainly it was only on the upper reaches of the inlets that hunting expeditions set out, and these preponderantly in search of mountain goats. For the rest, large animals were plentiful and getting them was a matter of setting traps or of occasional excursions along the water's edge. The fami- liar pits, dead-falls, and slip-loop snares were universal for capturing elk, deer, and bear. Hunters generally set out alone, but there were some occa- sions for group drives. Nets were a favorite device for entangling all kinds of animals. Depend- ing upon the requirements of mesh and purpose, they were made of cedar withes, bark, or sinew. Deer were driven into strong webs set across their runways; circular ones, operated by a release, surrounded rocks frequented by seals. A characteristic Salish net was strung on high poles near marshes to emesh frightened waterfowl at dusk. Night hunting developed a number of tricks with flares and blinds. Deer, coming down to drink, were shot when fascinated by a torch. Cod were attracted by the phosphorescence of stirred up water and by lights in canoes. Frequently a fire was built in front of a blind in the fore part of a canoe carrying two men. One of them quietly maneuvered the vessel among flocks of settled ducks while the other drew them in with a multi-pronged spear. Dogs were valuable and were treated accordingly. Some of them-there are indications that they were of a different breed from those reared for their wool-were put through a course of training involving magical appli- cations along with a more realistic regimen. They were taught to drive deer and elk into deep water and to raise mountain goats. They were well cared for in winter and put on small islands during the summer season. A number of magical practises clustered about the taking of seal, goat, and to some extent bear, deer, and salmon. Some men were believed to be especially favored by a supernatural helper in acquiring the first two, in return for which, continence and ceremonial purification were requisite. The hunter must not comb his hair, nor could his wife engage in any activity while he was away. For success in sealing, especially, she was cautioned to remain inactive or to move gently. The bones of most animals, including the salmon, were carefully disposed of and never given to dogs. Special restrictions hedged about the treatment of goat heads and organs. An at-</page><page sequence="7">124 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 40, 1938 tenuated bear ceremonialism existed among the Homalco, Klahuse, and Slaiaimun in the form of speeches to the bear before or after death and ritual disposal of the head; with this was the common belief that it licks its paws during hibernation. A young man never ate of the first animal he killed. It was always given to the old people, and he was ceremonially painted and sprinkled with down. The first salmon ceremony, a familiar feature on the Pacific Coast, was not performed by the Sechelt, Slaidimun, Klahuse, or Homalco. Within our restricted area this rite coincides rather closely with the distribution of sockeye, for which it was specifically reserved except at Squamish and Nanaimo. Food was prepared in one of three ways: by roasting on a spit, by baking in an earth oven, or by stone boiling in wooden vessels. Salt seems not to have been in demand, for only the Comox and some of the northeastern groups made use of seaweed cakes. The mortar was unknown, as were other stone vessels. Cooking and serving utensils were of maple or alder with some abalone inlay decoration and conventionalized modeling to represent ani- mals. The animal crest feasting dishes so dear to the Kwakiutl had spread only as far south as the Pentlatch and Slaiimun. Sheep horn ladles did not get beyond Comox, although the smaller black ones of goat horn were in use everywhere, the raw material being supplied by the mainland tribes. Water pails, chests, and other containers were made of cedar boards, steamed, bent, and sewed. The importance of wood working helps to explain in some measure the secondary position of basketry. Information on this subject is confusing and difficult to get because of the specialized nature of the craft and its virtual non-existence today, but at least this much can be made out, that the forms, techniques, and uses of baskets were relatively few. The carrying basket for roots, berries, and clams was known universally in rectangular shape with the bottom smaller than the top. In the finer specimens the opening was constricted, giving a "parenthetical" aspect to the four corners. The technique was wrapped twine, the only one employed in rigid basketry except for two isolated reports of split warp and crossed warp variations of plain twining.3 Soft rush bags in plain twine and/or checker prevailed on Vancouver Island, while most groups were familiar with the same sort of container using cedar bark and the checker-work technique. Rectangular sewed baskets, imbricated and of the style referred to as Klikitat, were common all along the mainland. Individual specimens un- doubtedly got across the Strait, but to judge from the earliest collections 3 Sanetch and Pentlatch. They are open to doubt. For the terminology see 0. T. Mason, Technic of Aboriginal American Basketry (American Anthropologist, Vol. 3, pp. 109-28, 1901).</page><page sequence="8">BARNETT] COAST SALISH OF CANADA 125 and from two explicit denials by informants, it seems safe to infer that they were not made there. A variety of sewing, using rings instead of spiral coils, should also be noted. Other fabrics were made of wool, cedar bark, and rushes. The twilled wool blanket came from the well known Salish roller loom. To the basic dog wool was added that of goats, if it was to be had, or some other fibrous substance such as cattail pappus or duck down. Associated with the loom was a large spindle, spun in the two hands with a tossing motion. Another weaving complex, presumably derived from the Kwakiutl, included the suspended warp, twining, and a small spindle rolled on the shank. It had spread as far south as Pentlatch on the one side and Slaiaimun on the other. If the somewhat ragged information can be trusted, checker- work cedar mats had the same distribution, as did a twined fabric of the same material. Over all the area, wall and floor mats were of rushes threaded together with a long needle. The accent upon cedar, and vegetable fibers generally, carries over into articles of everyday dress. It was not uncommon for men, the older ones especially, to go naked, but when this was not the case they wore as an under garment a bark clout or fringe. Women wore a shredded bark or rush knee length skirt, usually of one piece. As a protection against the weather both sexes provided themselves with fur robes or woven blankets caught up over the left shoulder. Those who could afford it used wool. Basketry hats, of cedar root and of southern Kwakiutl design, had not reached lower Vancouver Island nor beyond Sechelt. Even there they were rather reserved for formal occasions. Some departure from the above dress pattern is discernible on the main- land. Buckskin is more in evidence. Three descriptions of knee length trousers and one of a fitted shirt come from this side, but they may be late borrowings. Leggings and mittens formed a part of the hunter's outfit, as did two piece moccasins. Snowshoes with trailer and upturned toe must be set down as another trait not ordinarily associated with the coast Indian. Body ornamentation involved a minor amount of tattooing, head de- formation, and a piercing of the ear and nose. The mainland tribes avoided the first of these; the others occasionally striped the cheeks or chin of their women and assertedly drew more elaborate figures on the chests and thighs of the men. Both sexes of the well-to-do were given to wearing heavy aba- lone pendants from the ears and nose. A minimum of copper and some bone work adorned their necks, wrists, and ankles. Olivella shells were strung as beads in the southern part of the area, but, curiously, no group but the Sanetch knew the dentalium. Canoe building, like sealing, was a specialized pursuit. The hereditary</page><page sequence="9">126 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 40, 1938 element entered, but was not an indispensable prerequisite. Of more im- portance psychologically were certain sympathetic songs or incantations bestowed, in the first instance at least, in token of a personal contact with some supernatural assistant. Very often this was a woodpecker. The critical operations such as splitting or steaming were undertaken in privacy, at which time the personal ritual was used and several taboos observed by the man and his wife. The preliminary shaping was accomplished with the aid of fire, wedges, and celt chisels. A spool-shaped hand maul served as a hammer, and prac- tically the only one. The hull was usually burned out, finally to be smoothed down, inside and out, by adz work. The "D" adz was universal, but the Comox and northeastern groups made an elbow type as well.4 The surface texture resembling hammered bronze resulting from these tools was valued in other woodwork, but the outer surface of canoes was further rubbed down with an abrasive such as dogfish skin for greater efficiency in the water. There is no adequate treatment of canoe types for this region, nor can the matter be gone into here. Suffice it to say that there existed two well substantiated types and that these were mutually exclusive in their dis- tributions. One was definitely mainland, the other belonged to Vancouver Island. One and all recognize the so-called "West Coast" (Nootka) form as intrusive, as they do for a Kwakiutl model or two which had found its way to some of the northern groups. Indigenous types were hewn from half logs, which put a considerable limitation on their size and made them rela- tively low at bow and stern. Improvised canoes of folded bark were regu- larly made for lake travel by the northern mainlanders, and the Homalco made a river canoe of cottonwood. The latter was called a "shovel nose" but any genetic connection with the typical shovel nose of Puget Sound is doubtful in view of its specific non-occurrence elsewhere. Paddles were of maple, yellow cedar, and yew. Those of men and women differed in shape and coloration, and despite a variety of forms a distinctive Salish pattern for each sex can be made out. Bailers were of bark. Sails were improvised of boughs or house boards, but matting and thin boards (in the north) were commonly put to this use. There is some justification for the generally accepted notion that the Coast Salish we are considering lived in very long plank houses with single sloped roofs, the high side facing the water. This association dates from the observations of Fraser, Kane, and other early travelers to their country; and, indeed, it is true that the tribes living on the lower course of the Fraser, and the Squamish as well, knew no other kind. Furthermore, it was the 4 For types see R. L. Olson, Adze, Canoe, and House Types of the Northwest Coast (Univer- sity of Washington Publications in Anthropology, Vol. 2, No. 1, 1927), pp. 13-17.</page><page sequence="10">BARNETT] COAST SALISH OF CANADA 127 prevailing type around Victoria and Cowichan Bay and rivaled the gable roofed structure at Pender Harbor (Sechelt). Elsewhere it was regarded as indicating inferior means or ambitions, though the rich sometimes set them up at summer locations. Their distribution was therefore coincident with the Salish, but their importance faded away to the north and northeast in favor of another very nearly universal type. Consequently, it would appear that in this respect two historically diverse impulses have permeated and fused in Salish territory, one spreading from the outlet of the Fraser, the other seeping down from the Kwakiutl in a characteristic pattern rela- tive to Vancouver Island and the mainland coast.5 A second impression which has gained currency from the same reports is that these dwellings, in places said to exceed five hundred and more feet over all, were unsegmented units with a broad unobstructed avenue running the entire length. Actually, each was composed of a series of individually constructed units-houses in fact-formed by as many cross-wise plank partitions. Each house then averaged a twenty-foot front- age and a fifty-foot depth with family quarters around its four walls, a "long house" in itself with roof sloping from front to back. The partition served as a common wall for two houses and indicates at once the economy which dictated the successive additions and ultimate great length. The character of the terrain was undoubtedly a factor as well, for in most places the division was complete and the units became separate structures with an increased frontage. A unique resolution of difficulties was achieved by the largest village at Point Grey. It was circular in ground plan and com- prised seventy-six segments or houses. In all plank dwellings, gabled and shed alike, the pitch of the roof was never great. The roof planks were bracket-shape in cross section and over- lapped like tiles. They lay in place by their own weight and could be shifted aside for light or ventilation. The structure which supported them was not relied upon for the support of the walls so much as were secondary uprights between which the horizontal wall boards were clamped. Around all four walls there was a low bed platform, and above it at the height of a few feet a mat, or in the north, a plank canopy. Varying stretches of it were re- served for the individual families and the divisions were marked by mat or board screens. Smoking and drying racks were suspended over the several fires, although separate outside structures were sometimes built for this purpose. The custom prevailed of naming individual houses after some as- pect of their locations, as "across the creek." Several features relative to houses belong only to the Comox, Pentlatch, I This is my interpretation in spite of a native explanation to the effect that the shed type is just half a gabled one, and hence less costly and pretentious.</page><page sequence="11">128 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 40, 1938 and the three northeastern groups, Homalco, Klahuse, and Slaidimun. Among them are completely enclosed family compartments, floor exca- vation-sometimes to more than one level, with a resultant increase in seating capacity for festive occasions-and a greater and lesser develop- ment-or borrowing-of the crest motif. In this last respect mainland in- formants clearly recognize their indebtedness to the north, and in fact date it from the time when the white man put a stop to their inter-tribal wars. The Comox, on the other hand, were thoroughly saturated and at home with it. All of these groups had some zoomorphic dishes (Kwakiutl "house dishes"), made doors to represent animal mouths, and carved their interior house posts into human figures. Some crude painting was done on the house fronts. Projecting beam ends were carved into heads, and the impressive fact is that these and the dishes, even among the Comox, so consistently portrayed only the seal and the sea lion. A few memorial shafts with a small human figure at top and bottom were erected by the Klahuse. It is an evi- dence of the degenerated nature of these "crests" that Kwakiutl carvers were hired to do them by anybody who wanted to and could afford it, without any pretensions to a traditional right to the particular figure. The custom of carving anthropomorphic roof supports and also beam ends carried on to the Sechelt and Squamish. Even the Muskwium observed the first of these and added yet another characteristic figure to grave box ornamentation. Here it is entirely possible that we have to do with a second set of influences of up river origin. They barely touched the Sanetch, and the Cowichan and Nanaimo not at all, for the carvings which exist at these places at the present day are repudiated by the better informed natives as alien to their culture. A few other structures deserve brief mention. The summer shelters were of the sort constructed by the Puget Sound tribes: a lean-to or a four post frame covered over with mats, bark, or sometimes planks. "Pup tent" structures, for the accomodation of one person at a time, were dug out, covered with bark and earth, and used for steam sweating by the tribes on the mainland. For the same purpose the Vancouver Island groups' impro- vised an individual wickiup of branches and mats, or simply steamed them- selves under a blanket covering. Of distinct interest from a wider point of view is the presence of semi-subterranean retreats west of the Coast Range. They were known from Howe Sound to Bute Inlet and were used as refuges in time of war. Furthermore, the Muskwium on Point Grey built under- ground dwellings of exactly the same type as those farther up the valley. 6 They resorted to it only for minor ailments, however, while the former set of tribes used it also for ceremonial purification.</page><page sequence="12">BARNETT] COAST SALISH OF CANADA 129 They existed side by side with the plank shed roofed habitations already described, and were a luxury for those who could afford them. Plank houses were built by the cooperative efforts of the occupants. Specific data from which to draw generalizations cannot be obtained beyond the grandparental generation of the oldest informants, but to judge from these, the house building and owning nucleus comprised a man and his sons, or several brothers. Paternal cousins and at times sons-in-law were included. Each retained such equity for himself and his descendants as was accorded him on the basis of labor and materials contributed. An instance is recorded of a quarrel between two brothers at Comox which resulted in the removal of one who stripped his half of the house bare of its walls and roof to set up an independent household with his son-in-law. This was the recourse of a man of means; others could not afford to be so sensitive and preferred for many reasons to maintain their brotherly affiliations. Never- theless this process of segmentation of the extended family within a village must be looked upon as the ordinary mechanism of its growth. Not infre- quently brothers or cousins owned adjacent houses, and in all probability the principle of kinship through males governed the formation of villages and even the aggregates of villages as at Cowichan Bay. Residence, with few exceptions, was patrilocal, which brought it about that a man and his brothers, with their extended families in the male line, lived under one roof. Slaves, widows, orphans, and other dependants made up the remainder. One of the men, usually the eldest in the direct line of the founder, was looked to for guidance and protection by the rest of the house mates. He was granted their respect and allegiance on the score of his prestige and influence. By virtue of his aristocratic birth he owned or exercised a controlling interest in certain property rights and ceremonial privileges. His brothers and house mates were not entirely excluded from them and in order to validate his birth right he was expected to improve upon it by industry, generosity, and dignified behavior. Through an intelli- gent exercise of these qualities he was able to maintain an appreciable control over his retainers. It was power of an informal sort, implicit in the kinship bond which linked him in some way with almost every member of his extended household. To sum up, we may say that the house governor's authority was founded upon and defined by his rights as an influential relative and property owner. In return for his patronage he expected and received the support and coop- eration of his adherents. He could not afford to abuse their dependence, nor could they risk his disfavor. There are stories of tyrants and bullies, but they are rare and recited with disapproval. If the situation became unbear-</page><page sequence="13">130 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 40, 1938 able a man could always move into the house of another powerful relative, especially one on the maternal side. Some men, to avoid embarassment in difficult domestic situations, preferred to set up a nearby shack of their own rather than insist upon a remote claim within the big house. On the whole the arrangement was beneficial to all concerned: service and defer- ence were traded for economic security and vicarious glory. Outside his house group the governor had no real authority and was able to achieve only as much precedence among his peers as his prestige and influence war- ranted. Political power was coincident with social status. These head men are commonly called chiefs by observers on the North- west Coast. It is important to note, however, that the Coast Salish disavow the implications of the term as they have come to know them through government administration. They say that they had no chiefs, and rightly too, if by that we mean the incumbent of an office. The notion of an office, in the sense of a functionally defined position, was almost nonexistent by comparison with that concept among the Nootka and Kwakiutl. There was no feeling that a house implied a chieftainship as we feel that a state implies a ruler; depending upon their personal attributes, several men- two, three, or four-in the same house might be entitled to the honorific hegus or siem. For convenience we may translate this as chief; the natives make shift with such equivalents as "gentlemen," "hightone men," "smart men," and "real men." Property, the outward symbol of rank and status, was recognized in material goods and ritual privileges. Incorporeal property rights will be discussed more fully under rituals, but the same rules of ownership and transmission applied to them as to other valuable possessions. Apart from houses and their furnishings, corporeal property consisted mainly of hunt- ing and fishing lands and appliances. Nets of all sorts were owned, as were pitfalls, deadfalls, fishing and sealing sites. On the mainland goat hunting lands were divided up among a comparatively few families. All of these possessions were expensive and restricted. They were in the hands of the chiefs who shared their produce with their henchmen and retainers. Clam- ming places were free to all, but root plots were held in severalty by families. Weapons, canoes, and wool blankets were individually owned and highly prized for their potlatching value. Only the Comox traded upon the ficti- tious values of copper plates derived from the north. Descent and inheritance were reckoned bilaterally with a decided pref- erence for the patrilineal. There is no reason for believing that a feeling of nearer kinship with the father's people is responsible for this bias, as the bilateral transmission of names and the kinship nomenclature will testify.</page><page sequence="14">BARNETT] COAST SALISH OF CANADA 131 As a part of the dowry or bride price return, the son-in-law was sometimes given custody of a certain masked dance to be held in trust for his son. The Salish share this mode of transmission with the Kwakiutl, but for the for- mer at least the evidence seems to favor an interpretation in terms of a bilateral acknowledgement of kin coupled with a development of return giving, rather than as an infiltration of northern matrilineal principles into a purely patrilineal complex. Primogeniture was the rule, but was not insisted upon as an inflexible principle. Daughters, for example, could inherit important property only exceptionally, and personal aptitudes were a noteworthy consideration in passing along hunting, technical, and ritual property. Sons received from fathers in preference to brothers unless other factors of age and fitness en- tered. Very much depended upon the circumstances. In the ordinary course of events the most desirable acquisitions clustered about and descended in the lineal strain of eldest sons. From this nucleus there was a more or less gradual shading off into the trivial, and the more so the greater the number of generations, so that the youngest son of a youngest son received precious little of the original patrimony. It must have been extremely difficult for him to improve upon this situation in aboriginal times within the closed system of a well regulated economy. A possible way out was by a fortunate marriage, of which there are traditions and some historic accounts. From the above it should be clear why the word caste conveys a mis- understanding of class differentiation as it existed among the Coast Salish. Between the highest and the lowest there was a wide gap, but they were intimately connected by a blended scale of free men. In a sense there were noble families (those of first sons), but own cousins of these might be com- moners. Hence, the ever reiterated attitude of nobles to commoners was one of tolerance and encouragement. The only class of despised men-and this was a personal matter-were those referred to as "lazy men," those with- out ambition as it was conceived by the Salish. A Comox man who could once "hold the people" (potlatch) became a real man, though not so "real" as one who had accomplished it several times or more grandly. Commoners who could not achieve this distinction in their own right hunted and worked for their aristocratic kinsmen and were compensated by public acknowl- edgement of their contribution, by repayment in other goods, or by good will feasts and entertainments.7 SThis is not an attempt to fuse the extremes of status, for very real differences separated the behavior and degree of participation proper to them. On the other hand, it is important to bear in mind the non-categorical implications of the catchwords "nobles" and "com- moners."</page><page sequence="15">132 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 40, 1938 Slaves were a class apart, totally subservient, but not tortured or physi- cally abused. They were taken on war raids and to own two or three was a distinction given only to men who were in a position either to buy or to cap- ture them. Usually they were taken as children, then reared as menials in the houses of their masters. The dishonor attaching to their station was hereditary; therefore intermarriage with them, except by the lowest of freemen, was unthinkable. There are some indications that the stigma, in the exceptional case, could be lifted by a formal distribution of property but a slave ancestor was always a vulnerable point for the malicious thrusts of an enemy. As would be expected, the majority of marriages were contracted be- tween social equals. Varying degrees of pomp and ceremony, depending upon the standing of the two families, signalized the union. To add quality to the occasion a fiction of non-acceptance was acted out which recalls the war-like formalities of the Kwakiutl. The groom's party ap- proached the girl's house by canoe even within the same village. The door was barred to them and they had to pay influential sympathizers to "break it down." This consisted of speeches by resident relatives or by the several chiefs accompanying the boy, his father, and his mother as formal repre- sentatives. Once admitted, the boy sat humbly near the door for days, say- ing nothing and eating little of the food which his people were allowed to prepare for themselves. Sometimes they left him alone and stayed with relatives in another house. Each day his father's speakers harangued the girl's people upon the desirability of the match. At length they relented and the two families ate together. Finally, the whole village was called in to witness the union and the exchange of goods. This ceremony was costly, for every step in the procedure called for a payment. Each speaker was honored with a blanket or two for his "good words." The groom's party always brought a great amount of food, which was divided equally among all those present on the last day; when they left they were given food to be similarly distributed when they got home. The bride price in blankets was turned over to the girl's father who apportioned it immediately among his nearest responsible relatives. It was incumbent upon them to return it with ceremony at some future date, usu- ally at a visit the following winter. In the southern part of the area the re- turn was in equivalence; in the north, on both sides of the Strait, it was more often double. The exchange of sisters in marriage was common, as was child betrothal. Sometimes an industrious youth without means was taken into the house- hold of a wealthy man as the husband of a younger daughter, but in this,</page><page sequence="16">BARNETT] COAST SALISH OF CANADA 133 as in every other case, some payment had to be made to legitimatize the union. This was true even of the sororate and levirate, which, by the way, were entirely optional and not more frequent than other forms of remar- riage. They were possibilities only; a fact probably to be correlated with institutionalized bride price return. The Comox aristocrats performed a travesty of marriage without a bride for the sole purpose of acquiring privileges in the exchange. This was their chief concern and consequently marriages were unstable. Over the rest of the area the most important consideration was the consolidation of one's social position through connections with important kin groups in other houses or villages. There were no preferred mates within the kinship nexus. First and second cousins were not acceptable, third cousins on either side were. This meant that marriages between house mates as well as village members was permissible, though for reasons given above inter-village alliances were sought after. The kinship system reveals several points of interest. Separate terms were used for father, mother, sister (Comox dialect), husband and wife, but apart from these no distinction was made between male and female relatives. Furthermore, relatives in the same degree of relationship, whether through males or females, were called by the same term. With few excep- tions the sex of the speaker made no difference. This brings it about that each of the following sets of relatives was designated by one term: siblings; youngest sibling; oldest sibling(?); older sibling and parent's older sibling's child; younger sibling and parent's younger sibling's child; parent's sib- lings; sibling's child; child; grandchild and sibling's grandchild; grandpar- ent and grandparent's siblings; step-parent; step-grandparent; husband's brother, brother's wife (ci speaking), wife's sister, and sister's husband (9 speaking); husband's sister and brother's wife (9 speaking); wife's brother and parent-in-law; sister's husband (ce speaking) and child's spouse.8 A reciprocal term also existed for relations through spouses (parent-in- law to parent-in-law and extending to the whole group). After the death of 8 Summarized from a Sanetch list. To judge from the reports of Boas on the Squamish (British Association for the Advancement of Science, 1890, p. 688) and Hill-Tout on the Sechelt (Journal, Royal Anthropological Institute, Vol. 34, 1904, p. 81) there was some varia- tion and elaboration in the sibling-cousin terminology. Boas also gives a common term for all siblings-in-law and another single one for parents- and children-in-law (reciprocal). This does not appear on Vancouver Island, though there is some indication of the same thing in the Hill-Tout list.</page><page sequence="17">134 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 40, 1938 a spouse another term replaced throughout the one which had been used by the relatives through marriage. No avoidance patterns of any sort were practiced. Terms for parent generations back to the sixth were known to the Sanetch, who used the last one to designate an hereditary privilege. The critical periods in the individual life cycle were heavily laden with ritual forms, the most striking feature of which was the regularity of their reappearance on several diverse occasions. Within the limits of a summary it is not feasible to go into all their details, so that only a few of the more important can therefore be touched upon. The most elaborate and important rituals were associated with the death of a spouse (of either sex), with girls' puberty, and with the dancer initiation. At the death of a parent less care had to be taken, and still less for the death of a child. The information is not consistent from one group to another, but it seems fairly clear that upon the birth of a first child the parents, in one way or another, had to refrain from their ordinary habits for four days. The birth of twins greatly altered their behavior, for they were required to live apart in the woods for a year or more. Friends and relatives aided them in getting food, while they carefully sought some supernatural favor prompted by a touch of the sacred as it surrounded them at this time. The twins themselves had a certain amount of super- natural power, and were good fishers, since they were related to the salmon. Girls at puberty and women at childbirth were secluded behind mat partitions in the living house and at times in huts outside (mainland).9 The dancer initiate was also kept behind a screen. The drinking tube and scratcher are prominent features on most of these occasions, one or both even being prescribed for the initiate and the boy pubescent. Few other formal observances applied to the latter but the significant fact is that there was any recognition at all beyond the usual informal Spartan training for manhood. Some other restrictions had an obvious social significance, being designed to induce a decorous and becoming behavior in later life. More of them had a religious import. With some local exceptions, a consistent pattern which appears at first childbirth (for the father), puberty, initiation, and at the spouse's death is a ceremonial feeding at the end of four or eight days, and for the man a re-introduction into the fundamental daily occupations. Specific trait asso- ciations which occur again and again are those which have to do with the 9 In the south at least (Sanetch, Sechelt, Nanaimo) an aristocratic girl was sometimes kept in complete seclusion and inactivity until the day of her marriage. Her untouchability and the mystery surrounding her very existence enhanced the possibilities of a favorable match.</page><page sequence="18">BARNETT] COAST SALISH OF CANADA 135 importance of wool, bark, down, daylight, the east, hair combing, bathing, fasting, red paint, etc. Most of the life crises were regarded as dangerous situations during which the individual was at once empowered and con- taminated by the supernatural. From these influences he had to be re- lieved by a ceremonial purification after a regular period. Above Nanaimo and Squamish this could be done by the individual himself, coached by an older person, but for the others an hereditary functionary was employed for the service. In fact, there flourished in this southern section a variety of privileged performances which had no other function than to "wash" the dancer novice, the pubescent, and the corpse awaiting burial. They were expensive demonstrations, dances, tricks-shows in effect-which had nothing intrinsically to do with cleansing, but capitalized upon this aspect of crisis rites for their elaboration. The real purificationist (siwtn) operated less spectacularly with more esoteric lore. All of these events, as well as any other which marked a new relationship between the individual and his group, were celebrated by a distribution of property. That was the recognized mechanism by which any public an- nouncement could be made and it was the only one, so that the person without property had no means of asserting status in his society. An insti- tution existed whereby an individual in anticipation of such a distribution was "helped" or loaned blankets by others, while he at the same time called in those which he had previously loaned out. The return among the Comox, Homalco, Klahuse, and Slaiimun was double (100 percent interest) so that it was wholly to a man's advantage to put himself in the position of a universal creditor in advance of his proposed distribution. It might take place any time during the year, but the grand inter-tribal affairs were held in the spring. One man, perhaps two or three, took the responsibility for the calling, but anyone could take advantage of the congregation to give a "cry song" for his dead, name his child, etc. Crisis periods were auspicious occasions for the seeking of supernatural helpers. The susceptibility of parents at the birth of twins has already been noted. A bereaved spouse was sent into the woods daily and often received a visitation in his or her exhausted half hysterical condition. Puberty was the time par excellence for seeking, though for girls the procedure was milder and offered less reward than for their brothers. The boy stayed in lonely places, fasted, took emetics, and scrubbed himself with boughs. An essential part of his quest involved swimming and diving, often to the point of exhaustion or unconsciousness, in which state he received a vision, a song, a spirit cry, and promise of help according to the nature of his wishes. Otherwise his experience came in a dream. Frequently some startling real</page><page sequence="19">136 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 40, 1938 occurrence induced the dream; on the mainland the dreamer had a fore- boding of a real encounter which knocked him unconscious and replaced the underwater ordeal. Dreams had to recur to be valid. Everyone sought them, since they gave luck in hunting, in acquiring wealth, in fighting, in doctoring. Powers were not inherited and their acquisition was kept strictly secret; hence no image or representation was made to proclaim them. They were almost exclusively from birds, animals, and fabulous spirits or mon- sters. There were no restrictions on killing such an animal. On the contrary, that very favor was bestowed on the hunting man. The shaman's quest was exactly like that of any other person but was more intense, was psychologically conditioned for that end, and ceased only with the acquisition of several powers instead of one. Some spirits were deemed ineffectual for curing purposes, and others, such as the double- headed serpent, were tremendously powerful and dangerous. The most potent spirits caused a man to bleed from all the apertures of his body at the time their power struck and entered it. There they resided henceforth, to be summoned into activity by singing to do the work of curing. Ordinary individuals also were known to appeal to their spirit helpers in time of stress. There was no initiation or induction ceremony for the shaman, and no societies. Sickness was caused by soul loss, intrusion of a foreign object or a spirit, contamination, and by magic. There were two souls; one in head, the other in the heart. They could wander off in sleep, be abducted by shamans and ghosts, or be displaced by a sudden fright. It was the duty of the shaman as defined above to send his powers in search of the soul, or, according to some, to send his own soul. A material object such as hair or a piece of bone was removed by sucking, and an intruded spirit by manual manipulations. Destruction of either of these was harmful or fatal to the sender. At a curing the shaman sang with the aid of his wife and others. He had no drum, rattle, nor any appurtenance other than a bowl of water which reflected the universe, and some down or bark on which to catch the soul. On the mainland he shook or "danced" in a semi-possessed state; elsewhere he sat with an arm over his eyes. Two other professional dealers in the supernatural require mention. The first (siiiwii) was but a specialized shaman who had received his power from the dead and who functioned as a clairvoyant and treated those afflicted by ghosts. The second class had no connection with dream experi- ences or spirits but had come by their secret knowledge through instruction. They were called siwtn from the private word formulae which they pos- sessed and jealously guarded. Some were well disposed and acted as purifiers</page><page sequence="20">BARNETT] COAST SALISH OF CANADA 137 and in a ritual capacity, as at the first salmon rite. Others were workers of contagious magic. The siwtn was not known to the Sechelt, Slaiiimun, Klahuse, or Homalco. The winter ceremonies of the Coast Salish reveal more clearly than any- thing else a tri-partite division of the area along the lines suggested in the introduction. It would be futile to dwell upon the complexity of the subject, but there is some point in calling attention to the modification and muta- tion of pattern within this narrow, restricted territory. If affords another good example of the rather abrupt shifts and re-associations which mark the diffusion of ceremonial complexes on the Northwest Coast. Nothing more than an outline can be attempted in this place, and for the reason given, the characterizations will gain in clarity by sub-areal descriptions. Sanetch-Cowichan-Nanaimo-Squamish-Muskwium: Participation in the winter dances of this group was conditioned by the individual acquisition of a dreamed power, that is, a guardian spirit of the order de- scribed above. Lesser animal spirits of all sorts counted for this require- ment, along with the powerful ones for hunting and fighting, and a very few nature spirits. They were not inherited, but the important point is that the dancing group was a closed organization requiring a formal initiation. Anyone could join regardless of whether his parents belonged, and regard- less of whether he had received a vision. In fact, it was the function of the initiation to instill a power into the novice; if he already had one, it might come through the ordeal or be smothered and replaced by a wholly artifi- cially induced one. This was no less true for a shaman than any other person who danced in the winter ceremony. The induction was accomplished by a surprise attack upon the boy or girl at the instigation of some relative who was to pay for the four day ritual of initiation. The novice (hcsalkw) was beaten, smothered, and choked until he was unconscious-"dead" they say-by his attackers, who were of course already members and his constant attendants for the remainder of the season. Immediately he was placed behind a screen in a corner of the big house and an established morning and evening public ritual inaugurated over his exhausted body. Attendants hovered over him using every means to "bring out" the song of his power. At length it welled up, or one was framed for him and drummed into him. On the fourth day he made a circuit of the village, singing and dancing. Throughout this period and for the remainder of the winter season the attributes and accessories of the novice strongly recall the hamatsa and other dancers to the north. Members danced singly, assisted by the singing and drumming of all the others. Their song revealed the nature of their power, and they wore</page><page sequence="21">138 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 40, 1938 head dresses of bark and down, but no wooden masks. They were often in an uncontrollable ecstatic state. The only mask known to this group of tribes was the so-called swaixwe,10 not of northern origin but probably coming from the Fraser River. It was not used for the winter dancing. It was one of the privileged exhibitions already spoken of in connection with crisis rites; an interesting accent which applies with complete regularity to the other inherited privileges, most of which can be recognized by their association with an hereditary song and a rattle. Comox-Pentlatch: The dancing complex just described was also known to these two tribes, but it was almost entirely submerged under a more highly regarded formal winter ceremonial taken over bodily from the Kwakiutl. Dream singing and possessed dancers were viewed rather con- descendingly, as were most things Cowichan. Non-members provoked them into an ecstasy (as they did also to the south) while the members of the masked dancing society looked stolidly on. In reality the latter were actors given to playing out a hollow caricature of this same spirit possession of which they disapproved. The completely formal overlay had not suppressed spirit seeking for the requisite supernatural aid in hunting, curing, etc., but it had given an overweening importance to transferable spirits as they were represented in masked dances. It is not necessary to describe them, nor the initia- tion by abduction and seclusion, for the facts do not differ appreciably from those published for the Kwakiutl.11 The same masks, and the same dancers appear with northern names: hamatsa, hawinrL, tohwfit, etc. Homalco-Klahuse-Slaiiimun-Sechelt: With these groups it is difficult to be certain of some of the major patterns in terms of those known to their neighbors. Part of this difficulty lies, I feel sure, in their own misconceptions and confusions over their borrowed traits. The feature which appears to have been basic, and in all probability represents an original winter dance pattern of all the Coast Salish, was an individual performance imitating some animal. Very likely it was connected with a guardian spirit but it seems to have involved more mimicry than similar dances on Vancouver Island. Some dances may have been without a song; most of them certainly 10 A partial exception involves only the Sanetch who shared the xflnxani'te with the Klal- lam. See E. Gunther, Klallam Ethnography (University of Washington Publications in An- thropology, Vol. 1, No. 5, 1927), pp. 281-88. For swaixwe refer to F.

Boas, Social Organization and Secret Societies of the Kwakiutl Indians (Report, United States National Museum for 1895, pp. 311-738, 1897).</page><page sequence="22">BARNETT] COAST SALISH OF CANADA 139 were not. The actors did not form a society, and there was no initiation. A person began to dance when he felt secure in his power and after he had taught the professional song leader his song-and when he had accumu- lated enough for a few presents. These dancers contributed the bulk of the exhibition and were called by a term which signified "shaman." Further- more, true curing shamans also danced in that capacity, showing off their powers with demonstrations of death and resurrection, decapitation, fire walking, etc. Doctors, as such, did not perform in the winter dances of the other two areas. Their feats were usually shocking and fearful, and the people did not like them. Along with these unorganized dances, a distinct group was created by a formal initiation requiring a four day secret retirement in the woods. Returning clad in branches, the novice (hausaulk) danced publicly, and without further ceremony was relieved of his covering. The ritual care so prominent elsewhere was reduced to a minimum, and little prestige seems to have been derived from the perfunctory "initiation." At Sechelt it was so restricted in scope as to be associated with only one of the dozens of dance spirits. The same distinction of an initiated group within a larger unorganized body of dancers characterized the Squamish. Still a third winter dance pattern gave expression to a stronger interest in hereditary privileges. Its elements were indicative of professional speciali- zation, and theoretically were the property of families with an enviable reputation for hunting or fighting. They were entertaining, and generally took the form of brief dramatic scenes with realistic costumes and effects. It is not unlikely that they had crystallized out of spirit impersonations, but, like the Comox masked performances, they could be used in the profane season as well, any distribution of property justifying their display. To the same category belongs the only mask of certain occurrence north of Squamish. The Sechelt lacked it, but the three other tribes were familiar with the right to display, by inheritance or outright purchase, a modified Dzonoqwa mask, whose northern provenience and equivalent they recog- nized. Two others, of uncertain identity, may have been used by these same groups. IDENTIFICATION OF THE ETHNIC GROUPS Formerly the Comox claimed the territory between Campbell River and Salmon River, and it was only after the establishment of a Hudson's Bay post near the present-day town of Comox that they moved southward to that point to take up residence on the front doorstep of the Pentlatch. Their aboriginal homeland was decidedly to the north of this. Following upon their heels the Kwakiutl moved into the evacuated territory and today hold Campbell River and Cape Mudge.</page><page sequence="23">140 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 40, 1938 The Nanaimo maintained three seasonal sites in the near vicinity of the town by that name, including Departure Bay, Nanaimo River, and Gabriola Island. The Cowichan held Cowichan Bay with a number of villages up the river as far as Duncan. The West and East Sanetch were separated by the width of the peninsula which today bears their name. Each was a distinctly autonomous group, and there were still others, as at Patricia Bay and Malahat, but the inhabitants of all are re- ferred to by informants as Sanetch people. The Muskwium lived on the receding shore of Point Grey at the mouth of the north arm of Frazer River. Nearby, at Capilano Creek close to North Vancouver, there are at present some Squamish, but it is doubtful whether this group originally had any real claims anywhere on Burrard Inlet. Their home was at the head of Howe Sound and for some miles up the two rivers emptying therein. The Sechelt were well established over the entire area surrounding the peninsula named after one of their villages, and far up to the head of Jervis Inlet. Their winter village was at Pender Harbor. The Slaiamun adjoined them to the north and ex- tended their claims to include Cortes Island. Their principal village was on Mala- spina Inlet; at present their reserve is near Powell River. The Klahuse and Homalco were at home on Toba and Bute Inlets respectively, and did not venture out of these protected channels until a comparatively late date. Settlements were restricted to a few favorable locations along their shores and to the rivers in the back country. The group names employed are those which the natives now use in referring to themselves and to one another. It was thought best to forego accurate phonetic renditions in favor of more common spellings which often appear as place names on maps and are more familiar to the general reader. Boas in the First General Report on the Indians of British Columbian2 calls the Comox atl6'tq or K'5'moks. My Kwakiutl, insofar as it is considered, derives from the southernmost group, the Yukwiltaw, which he writes Le'kwiltok. Sechelt is the same as his SI'ciatl. His other transcriptions are P'E'ntlatc for Pentlatch, Sk-q6'mic for Squamish, and K-au'itcin for Cowichan. In the Second General Re- port13 he refers to the Qsd'nitc (Sanetch) as close linguistic relatives of the Lku'ngEn (Songish). The Snanaimuq14 are my Nanaimo. References to the other groups are few and not very illuminating. Sapir15 alludes to the L!Q'hQs dialect, spoken on the British Columbian mainland, with which Comox proper "was stated to be identical." This must be the Klahuse who, with 12 Report, Fifty-ninth Meeting, British Association for the Advancement of Science [for] 1889, pp. 801-99, 1890, p. 806. 13 F.

For these others too I find only the names mentioned. Curtis16 gives Huma'hlkyu, Hlaa'min, and Tlkyu's, with which I equate Homalco, Slaidmun, and Klahuse. Boas,7 in discussing the Salish dialects, refers to "the Claamen of Toba Inlet," which I construe to be a misplacement of the Slaiamun. In the report upon The Indian Tribes of the Lower Frazer River18 he lists the QmE'gkoyim, corresponding to my Muskwium, and to the Musqueam of the Handbook of American Indians. The other listings in the latter publication19 are also in more obvious agreement with the orthography used in the preceding pages.
