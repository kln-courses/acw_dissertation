<plain_text><page sequence="1">volume from cover to cover, the ob- scurities and minor errors that creep into even the best written books ap- pear to be unusually few. Some in- dividuals may object to certain choices of terminology (as in osmosis), to what they consider as inadequate treatment of certain topics (as in the two paragraphs devoted to root pres- sure), or to slighting of their favorite theories. In general, however, the contributors have done an excellent job of selecting material for inclusion, of discussing each area with a con- siderable degree of thoroughness, and of including the older basic knowledge as well as more recent developments. Of course, even seven large volumes (Volume I will be in two parts) are not enough to permit a really complete summary of plant physiological knowledge. Eight plant physiologists have con- tributed to this volume: Runar Col- lander on cell membranes, T. A. Ben- net-Clark on water relations of cells, 0. V. S. Heath on water relations of stomata and stomatal movements, F. C. Steward and J. F. Sutcliffe on inorganic salt absorption and accumu- lation, C. A. Swanson on translocation of organic solutes, 0. Biddulph on the translocation of inorganic solutes, and Paul J. Kramer on transpiration and the water economy of plants. Perhaps the weakest feature of the book is the subject index, which is quite incomplete, particularly as re- gards cross references, though this may not prove to be too great a handi- cap in view of the detailed table of contents at the beginning of each chapter. The author index and the index to plant species appear to be comprehensive and should be useful features of the book. Turning from the volume itself to the particular role the treatise as a whole will play in the ever-expand- ing literature of plant physiology, the question arises as to just how this treatise makes a contribution beyond those of the Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology, the numerous review papers, present and future mono- graphs, and the more comprehensive textbooks. The following quotations from the preface reveal the role of the treatise as visualized by the editor: "Until the end of the 19th century it was still possible for a comprehen- sive treatment of Plant Physiology to be written by one author, and the treatise of Pfeffer, in three volumes . is the outstanding example . . "The aim of this treatise, some fifty or more years after Pfeffer, is to say what Plant Physiology is about and to do this in sufficient detail and with sufficient analysis of, and even extracts from, the ever-expanding literature, so that each volume will be in a large measure self-contained. "Plant physiologists will find the treatment is sufficiently detailed to benefit their research in their own specialized fields and that the scope is broad enough to make reading of all portions of the work both stimulat- ing and profitable. This treatise is, therefore, designed for the use of advanced and postgraduate students, teachers, research workers, and in- vestigators in other fields of knowl- edge who need information about the present status of plant physiology." Strictly as a reference work, the Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology has the edge over the treatise being re- viewed in comprehensiveness though not in recency. Together, the two sets provide plant physiologists with an excellent and comprehensive reference base, wished-for but unavailable and not too hopefully anticipated only a few years ago. A minor danger of such reference works, particularly in areas outside one's own specialty, is that some valuable contributions that do not happen to be included may tend to become lost. An unavoidable draw- back is that any scientific work of this type has built-in obsolescence. The common observation that a science book is out of date the moment it comes from the presses applies with increasing force as the comprehensive- ness of a work increases. Of course, review papers take care of the new developments, but one hopes that the editor and publishers will find it pos- sible to revise the work at reasonable intervals. From the standpoint of readability the treatise is far ahead, not only of the ordinary review paper, but also the Encyclopedia, even when the fact that many plant physiologists do not read German as easily and rapidly as they should is ignored and only the English contributions are considered. The readability of the treatise will undoubtedly result in extensive if not complete perusal of the set by many plant physiologists for background in- formation outside their own special- ties. This may prove to be the most valuable contribution of the treatise. Another possible use, not mentioned by the editor, is that individual vol- umes could make good textbooks for graduate courses in specialized areas of plant physiology. Every plant physiologist and ad- vanced graduate student in plant physiology, as well as many others in related sciences, should have this set available in his personal library rather than having to rely on his institutional library for it. Unfortunately, the price is a serious drawback to many even when one volume is considered, although the book is well worth the money as present prices go. It would seem that foundations interested in the advancement of science might well consider partial subsidy of works of this type to bring their cost down to a level that the potential users can afford.

The fact that this is the seventeenth edition of "Burrows" would seem to indicate a wide and continuing useful- ness. Most of the revision of the present edition has to do with advances in the knowledge of the structure of bacteria and their metabolism and rather less with the diseases to which twenty-five of the forty chapters are devoted. Another five chapters have to do with the more general aspects of medical bacteriology and with im- munity. As such, this book is, as it has always been, heavily overweighted to the applied medical side and any course based on it must supplement, by lectures, the fundamental aspects. Since, however, this has always been the situation with this book, and since it continues to be widely used, this emphasis does not seem to be a serious drawback and may well be desirable. Basically, the book's pattern has not changed; this is a medical bacteriology and not a general bacteriology, and it will undoubtedly be widely used as its predecessors have been. Wayne W.

(1959) $8.50. This book is the product of 51 au- thors, five editors, and the American Phytopathological Society. It is, in fact, the Society's Golden Jubilee vol- ume. It collects the major addresses and symposium papers presented by some of the world's most noted scien- tists before the 50th anniversary meet- ing of the Society at Bloomington, Indiana in August 1958. Thus, "Plant Pathology" is a broad treatment of the science. It contains 46 AIBS Bulletin * April 1960</page><page sequence="2">something to interest every biologist, not only for plant pathologists, but also for specialists in such related sciences as genetics, physiology, and biochemistry; and indeed, there is much for young students of biology. The book has an important place in the literature of plant pathology and of other biological sciences. Carefully, and to a degree philosophically, it de- velops the history of plant pathology and projects its future. The book is in ten parts. Each part is devoted to a major division of the science. Most of the book-parts two through ten-contains the papers pre- sented before the nine symposia of the Anniversary meeting. There are six papers on physiology, seven on genet- ics, seven on fungicides and the chem- istry of fungicides, six on fungi, five on nematology, eight on the structure and the multiplication of viruses, and five on epidemiology. The authors of these papers are among the most distinguished in their own fields. For example, G. J. M. van der Kerk, of the Institute for Organic Chemistry, The Netherlands, con- tributes a paper on the "Chemical Structure and Fungicidal Activity of Dithiocarbamic Acid Derivatives," and Gerhard Schramm, of the Max Planck Institute for Virus Research, Germany, discusses "The Role of the Nucleic Acid in the Infection with Tobacco Mosaic Virus." It is significant that these two con- tributors came from foreign lands. Twenty-one of the 44 papers included in the symposia were presented by scientists brought here from England, Australia, South Africa, Germany, The Netherlands, Honduras, Mexico, and Canada. Part One of the Golden Jubilee vol- ume contains the seven major ad- dresses concerned with the history and development of plant pathology. Again, the prestige of the authors and the quality of their papers are outstanding. E. C. Stakman of the University of Minnesota relates plant pathology to the world's scientific and social development; John A. Stevenson of the United States Department of Agriculture traces the development of the science in North America; and J. G. Harrar of the Rockefeller Foun- dation discusses an international ap- proach to the study and control of plant diseases. Other contributors to this section are S. E. A. McCallan and George L. McNew of the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Re- search, J. C. Walker of the University of Wisconsin, and James G. Horsfall of the Connecticut Agricultural Ex- periment Station. All in all, "Plant Pathology" reflects much credit on the various commit- tees of the Society that were respon- sible for the presentation and publi- cation of these papers, the contents of which point to the significant role of biological sciences in the future of mankind. The editors and publisher should be complimented on the production of this book which not only is very read- able but also is handsomely bound in gold. Paul R. Miller, Crops Research Division, U. S.

Were an ichthyologist to see the title of this handsome book before he saw the volume itself, there is a good chance that he would consider it no further. Obviously not even a work many times this size could treat ex- haustively with all tropical fishes, let alone those known to be suited for en- joyment in aquaria. Nevertheless, the choice and extent of the information included in this substantial volume are most satisfying, even to a pro- fessional fish biologist. The offering is furthermore greatly enriched by more than three hundred photographs, (by Brian Barrett) including more than a hundred excellently reproduced in color. The value of the illustrations is strongly enhanced by the prevalent inclusion of both sexes, with their careful designation. In capsule form, these plates offer one of the richest displays of sexual dimorphism in the animal world. Nearly a third of "All about tropical fish" is an aquarist's vade mecum. Ob- vious care was taken, however, not only to provide instructions for build- ing, setting up, and maintaining aquaria, but also to creating under- standing of an aquarium as an eco- system. Indeed, the first thirteen chap- ters are a skilful digest of information on the physiological ecology of fishes and the manipulation of an aquarium environment to meet the needs of finny inhabitants chosen for it. Chapter titles encompass the follow- ing subjects: choice, setting, and maintenance of aquaria; aquarium limnology; dietetics of aquarium fishes; enemies, diseases, and humane treatment of animals; aquatic plants; biology of fishes; freshwater tropical aquarium fishes of more than twenty families; miscellaneous tropical ma- rines. The chapter on "Kindness and cruel- ties" is really quaint in its naivete, although to some readers it may be annoyingly anthropomorphic. For example, "bullies abound in the fish world, as they do elsewhere" and "few aquarists realize the terror instilled into their pets by unskilled catching." Disposal of aquarium fish by flushing them down the toilet is regarded as "extremely cruel"!. Although this work was obviously aimed at aquarists, it contains much of value for the student and the re- searcher in ichthyology as well as for teachers of ichthyology and behavioral biology. Considering the profusion of fishes (estimates of species numbers go as high as 40,000), relatively little information exists concerning most of them. Exceptions to this are most common among the food and game species and, as the present work so ably demonstrates, in the many aquarium kinds. In this book, there is a wealth of comparative, guideline information on such diverse subjects as courtship, nurture in relation to fecundity, gestation period, territori- ality, genetics, change of habits with life history stage, principles of ani- mal coloration (including sexual dichromatism), thermal and chemical preferenda, and space and nutritional requirements. It is a worthy addition to a field of literature long dominated in the English language by the works of Innes (e.g., "Exotic Aquarium Fishes"), and Stoye ("Tropical Fishes for the Home Their Care and Propa- gation"). Much of the observational and experimental data included are firsthand experiences and are addi- tions in fact to the knowledge of the groups represented. K. F.

These two college texts represent a field of biology teaching which on the secondary school level has been usurped by the non-biology oriented teacher, and the same trend is now appearing in the colleges. The Turner book is a standard col- lege health text of long standing in its latest revision. There is still an emphasis on human anatomy with some physiology included. Each chap- ter seems to begin with an anatomical treatment followed by its health as- pects. There is an interesting appen- dix explaining common prefixes and suffixes found in medicine. Also, there is a long and extensive treatment of common diseases included as an appendix. AIBS Bulletin * April 1960 47</page></plain_text>
