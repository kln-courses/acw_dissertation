The map (inset, left) shows the distribu- tion of these statues . Symbolic Archaeology on Easter Island by Joanne Van Tilburg There in plexing the are world and archaeological challenging so special, sites so that in the world so special, so per- plexing and challenging that they have fired the imaginations of generations of explorers, writers and storytellers. One of these sites is Easter Island or Rapa Nui. The pre- historic inhabitants of this island produced the world-reknowned sculp- ture so frequently referred to as "mysterious" and "enigmatic"- the in- stantly recognizable monolithic stat- ues of Easter Island. The geographic position of Easter Island (3,200 kilometers west of the South American coast and 2,000 kilometers southeast of Pitcairn, the nearest inhabited island), has allowed for a great deal of discussion about possible cultural origins and contacts between the island and the conti- nental New World. Romantic specu- lation has been woven into a fabric of fact and fancy to account for the creation of the island's large corpus of sculpture and architecture. The most publicized and enduring of these theories is that of Thor Heyerdahl of Kon Tiki fame, who proposed that a direct or near direct raft voyage from the mainland coast transported both the cultural rationale and tech- nological expertise to create the stone monuments. Such a position is not unique in the popular debate about Polynesian cultural origins, even though it has always been widely rejected by knowl- edgeable scholars of Polynesian pre- history. For years various writers have insisted on propagating a variety of diffusionist, direct contact, and dis- tinctly linear theories of cause and effect to explain the undeniable simi- larities between some customs and art forms in Oceania and the Old and New Worlds. Yet on Easter Island, all archaeo- logical work to date, including the fine work of William Mulloy, Arne Skjolsvold and other members of the Norwegian Archaeological Expedition of 1955, has produced only material evidence of Polynesian culture. Sub-</page><page sequence="2">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="3">sequent investigation by Patrick McCoy and William S. Ayres, and that of the island-wide archaeological sur- vey conducted by the Instituto de Estudios, Universidad de Chile, di- rected by Claudio Cristino F., confirms the Rapa Nui pre-contact culture as Polynesian. (See Archaeology, July/ August 1984 for a review of pre- vious work.) There is absolutely no hard data known from the cumulative effort of nearly 100 years of investi- gation which would archaeologically link the island to the mainland. It is reasonably certain at this stage of research that Easter Island was settled very early in the history of East Polynesia, sometime between A.D. 300 and 400. Scholars such as Roger Green of Auckland University and Patrick V. Kirch of the Univer- sity of Washington have suggested that the voyagers who colonized Easter Island may have been among the first to venture forth from the East Poly- nesian homeland in either the Mar- quesas or Society Islands. Kirch's theory of Ancestral Polynesian Society tells us a great deal about the shadowy figures aboard the canoe which first made landfall on Easter Island. His reconstruction, coupled with artif actual evidence, Rapa Nui oral history and ethno- graphic data, allows us to assume that these first colonizers were led by an ariki mau , or hereditary paramount chief called Hotu Matu'a, who was believed to be the direct descendent of ancestral gods. As chief, he was both secular and religious authority. He possessed profound spiritual power known as mana and the associated force of tapu. He was capable of in- fc. äLtJ* * -«ü yoking ancestral deities, and usually did so at the site of melae or ceremo- nial plazas (called ahu on Easter Island). Ritual activities included of- ferings and sacrifices, prayers and the possible ingestion of a nar- cotic infusion known as kava ( Piper methysticum). An important part of ritual practice was the production and use of a sacred red pigment. Aboard the canoe, in addition to the chief, would be men and women of the same kin group who possessed specific useful or valued skills. The most capable of these individuals would be acknowledged tuf unga or experts (called maori on Easter Is- land). Among the experts were fisher- men, agriculturists, warriors (matatoa), and stone carvers. Their supplies would include some of the documented elements of Polynesian</page><page sequence="4">material culture as well as a selection of plants and animals. Less tangible elements in their cultural baggage would include a so- cial system based on the conical clan, with ranked levels of status derived from genealogical proximity to the founding ancestor. We surmise that concepts of rivalry, status and hered- itary male privilege led to intrinsic, dormant social tensions with the po- tential of erupting into jealousy, revenge-taking and warfare. Religious beliefs likely included worship of some of the documented members of the Polynesian pantheon of gods. Tangaroa, god of creation, Tane or Tiki, patron of carvers and carving, and Tu, god of war, are suggested. The journey to Easter Island was probably an arduous one, and adaption to the island environment seems to have been less than completely suc- cessful. Important crops and animals were lost en route or failed in their transfer to the new island. Chickens, sweet potato, taro, and banana were successfully introduced but coconut, breadfruit and possibly kava were lost. The island they found has been shown, through pollen analysis studies conducted by John Flenley of the University of Hull, to have been covered by trees of several types. Fresh water was limited and natural re- sources included a narrow range of fish and wild birds. Once the voyagers had arrived and settled on Easter Island, the dis- tinctive development of these and other Polynesian characteristics seems to have unfolded in isolation to create the unique cluster of cultural attributes known as Rapa Nui. In this process, the natural environment of ^^^^andwasfundamentally altered. It was generally denuded of forest, certain species of birds and fish were periodically overexploited, and stone resources were quarried extensively. rJLhe island-wide archaeological sur- vey of Easter Island has recorded 11,913 archaeological features in 6,927 sites covering 8,855.45 hectares. A major part of the archaeological re- cord left behind are 239 ceremonial ahu sites, and between 800 a:p.d 1,000 monumental stone figures known as moai. The first religious architecture was likely constructed upon settle- ment, but the earliest dated ahu is Ahu Tahai I, shown by Ayres to have been in use by about A.D. 690. A red scoria statue head had been incorpo- rated into the stonework of the sec- ond building phase of the platform. The island's monolithic statues have been the focus of intensive doc-</page><page sequence="5">(Below) The study thoroughly documented all aspects of the statues and ahu sites, despite their poor preservation such as this example which had fallen from a small inland platform .

A total of 745 stat- ues has been recorded to date. This number includes 394 statues in Rano Raraku, a volcanic cone of consoli- dated lapilli tuff in which 94 percent of the total number of figures were carved, 300 statues reconstructed for 135 sites within the survey, 36 stat- ues sampled outside the survey, and 15 figures in museum collections around the world. The specific purpose of the statue project was the collection of a large quantity of objective, descriptive data in a standardized way. Each statue or fragment of a statue was doc- umented on all sites. Measurements of 55 discrete morphological and styl- istic attributes were taken. The stat- ues were drawn, photographed and completely described as to material, location, position, orientation, asso- ciations, and state of preservation. The collection of metric data in the field was standardized through the development of a unique recording format and the design and use of lightweight, large-scale calipers which produced increased accuracy in measurements. The analysis of the data was approached on two levels or in two stages. The first stage was a statisti- cal analysis which defined nine for- mal statue types. In this way we are able to describe overall size, shape and volume of all statues. The sec- ond stage was the analysis of discrete stylistic variation. The classification of each variant is based on subjective observation as well as general size differences. Applied decoration such as petroglyphs, paint or any carving not done in bas-relief is considered to be late and not part of original statue design. The nature of the documentation and analysis of the Easter Island sculpture is as monumental, in its way, as the statues themselves. A ty- pology of statue form and style has been developed through the study of the figures in their archaeological con- texts, which is a useful and flexible tool to be used in the temporal ordering of Easter Island prehistory. We are now in a position to deal forcefully with a number of miscon- ceptions about the statues and their role in the society which created them. U.S. Navy Paymaster William J. Thompson, who visited the island in 30 Archaeology the late 1800s, can be held responsi- ble for the origin of the oft-stated no- tion of "sudden abandonment" or "abrupt cessation" of statue carving and ahu construction. The idea that workmen dropped their tools and spontaneously left quarries, and that statues were all abandoned at the same time while "in transport" to coastal ceremonial platforms is melo- dramatic but inaccurate. The statue typology indicates clearly that while there is a statisti- cally evident trend toward increas- ingly larger statues over time, there is also a definite overlap in time of statue form and style. This means that while a statue of one size and form type was being carved for place- ment on one ceremonial site another statue of smaller or larger size and of the same or different form type was intended for either the same or a dif- ferent site. Progress or cessation of progress on any given statue was in- dependent, in large measure, of work on any other figure. Prior to the complete documenta- tion of the statues which we have recently accomplished, it was incor- rectly believed that the small number of statues not carved in Rano Raraku quarry were "experimental" or "proto- typical." Of the total corpus of statues known, only 32 exist which were not carved in Rano Raraku quarry. These figures were sculpted of basalt, trachyte and red scoria. The style range on all these statues varies considerably, overlapping that of figures carved of Rano Raraku tuff. It is unlikely that any of these fig- ures were ever "experimental." Some but not all of the red scoria figures were among the earliést stat- ues carved, and the use of this mate- rial in sculpture relates to similar practices in other parts of East Polynesia. There is no evidence that red scoria statues were ever placed on ahu, although they were assuredly a part of specialized cult activities as- sociated with ahu. These practices incorporated a specific and documented set of ceremonial arti- facts and may have involved human sacrifice and possibly cannibalism. A specialized priestly class which prob- ably evolved on the island conducted these rituals.</page><page sequence="6">(Below) This statue found on the transport road between the quarry and the south coast il- lustrates carved hands and hami, a component of the dor- sal design representing the sacred loincloth of mate au- thority. (Right) The hands of the statues were elaborately executed, and on the largest ones take on distinct wing-like qualities . These hands have double-incised lines separating the fingers, an added invest- ment of time and energy docu- mented at only a few sites . Stylistic analysis also reveals the evolution of statue form. The famous kneeling statue of Rano Raraku known as TUturi is one of two such figures documented. lUturi is postulated to be a late stylistic development, ante- cedents of which are clearly seen in other smaller sculpture on ahu sites. This suggestion is in direct contrast to earlier speculation which placed this so-called "aberrant" figure in an early time frame. Based on the cumulative evi- dence, Hituri was probably carved late in the Ahu Moai Phase (a.D. 1000- 1500) and has clear design antecedents in the larger corpus of sculpture. It may have had a specialized symbolic function, and may have emerged either as a response to some cultural trauma or re-alignment of socio-political structure which occurred late in the use of ahu. The statue may also have appeared in response to some special ritual sub-set of activity during the same time frame. Another frequent misunderstand- ing is that two extraordinarily com- plex religious cults- the statue cult and the post A.D. 1500 birdman cult which replaced it- developed indepen- dently and were completely distinct from one another. In other words, the statue cult was rejected, statues were toppled, and the birdman cult arose full-blown from the wreckage. Iconographie analysis of the stat- ues suggests that bird symbology was a real, important and evolving part of statue design. In particular, a bas- relief-carved dorsal design appears on the backs of some excavated im- ages in the quarry, on some statues once placed on ahu, and on several statues "in transport" to ahu. This dorsal design, in seven documented variations, was present on statues of more than one type of material and more than one form type. The com- ponents of the design include the ab- stracted form of the human face illustrated by the vertical line which indicates the spine of the statue and two curved lines at each shoulder. This depiction of the human face appears as well on carved wooden cer- emonial paddles, and is very signif- icant in Polynesian iconography and genealogy. Superimposed on this spine/face design is an abstracted or convention- alized representation of the sacred loincloth of chiefly authority (maro). The bas-relief single or double circles which surmount the curved lines of the maro find their closest counterparts in the circles which represent eyes on bas-relief birdman petroglyphs at the sacred site of Orongo. Here, Geor- gia Lee of UCLA has suggested the stylistic development of birdman pet- roglyphs in situ from incised line fig- ures to bas-relief carvings. Eye symbolism in dorsal design is sup- ported by the importance of the eye in Easter Island art and ideology. Stat- ues on one site have been shown by Sergio Rapu to have held red scoria and coral eyes in their carved sock- ets. Our documentation confirms the fact that only statues once erect on ahu had one or two types of carved eye sockets, both of which could have held inlay. .^^.nother frequent misconception about Easter Island is that, with the toppling of the ahu statues, the ideol- ogy which they represented was simul- taneously and summarily rejected. There are two notions implicit in this assumption which are not supported by the evidence. It is not clear, for example, that all statues were only toppled as a consequence of either warfare or competition. It is possible that some statues were ritually destroyed before new ones were placed on sites. Secondly, there is evidence to suggest that aspects of the statue cult ideology survived the period of carving and erecting monolithic statues. All available evidence indicates that one of the constant and recur- ring themes of Easter Island archae- ology is the reuse over time of ceremonial sites. Such reuse reached from the Settlement Phase (a.D. 400-1000) straight through the Pro to- historic Phase (1722-1868). Evidence of the importance of the beliefs and practices which the statues repre- sented can be seen in the various documented ways the statues and ahu were reutilized. Statues and statue fragments (particularly statue heads) were incor- porated into ceremonial architecture from one building phase to another in a probable belief that the statue's mana would also thus be transferred. March/April 1987 31</page><page sequence="7">This statue illustrates one of eight de- fined ear types. Cupules, pecked con- cavities of varying sizes, appear on many statues and they may have played a role in the ritual reuse of some figures. Statues were moved about on ahu sites and were repositioned in speciiic, ritually important ways. Stone align- ments of varying types were con- structed. Petroglyphs, cupules and red and white paint were applied to statues fallen from ahu, to those still in place in the quarries, or to those in intermediate positions. Specific, probably ritual damage was done to only certain parts of the figures, in particular the heads, eyes and occasionally the right arms. Stones were deliberately placed to break necks and damage faces when some statues fell. While some such damage was likely inflicted during warfare, a portion of it may also be due to the consecration or reconsecration of a ceremonial site. There is also ample evidence of efforts to remove or hide statues. In Heyerdahl's attempts to find stylistic similarities between Easter Island statues and those carved at a different time and in a different cul- tural context on the South American mainland, he described what he called "boulder heads." These figures are not, in fact, either boulders or heads only, but are in all cases recarved fragments of Rano Raraku tuff which were, in their first manifestation, intact stat- ues of defined types. Some of the recarved heads bear distinct resemblances to certain petroglyph forms, and were probably part of sec- ondary cult activity. The distinctive cylindrical red sco- ria "crowns" or "hats" placed on the heads of some ahu statues have been the focus of much speculation. Called pukao, fewer than 100 of these cylin- ders exist, although more may once have been present. There is a probable ideological re- lationship between the use of red sco- ria in pukao and for other purposes, including architectural enhancement of ahu. One line of investigation currently being studied is that the use of red scoria in statues, architec- ture, ritual artifacts, and pukao was part and parcel of the delineation of a priestly hierarchy which developed out of an emphasis on the acquired aspects of the metaphysics of mana. Just as all statues did not possess pukao, not all ahu were enhanced with red scoria facia, and not all statues possessed the distinctive dorsal de- sign. What this indicates is that some</page><page sequence="8">ahu sites may have been centers for the enactment of complex, regionally important rites, while others func- tioned for only local purposes. Today it is still possible to see rem- nants of the ancient road over which statues were transported from Rano Raraku quarry to ceremonial plat- forms. Katherine Routledge, leader of the Mana Expedition to Easter Is- land in 1914, mapped the northern, western and southern branches of what she called the "image road," which generally follows the lay of the land and avoids sharp changes in ter- rain where possible. Only one percent of the total corpus of statuary is lying "in transport" on or near these roads, and we have documented every figure. The majority of them were apparently being moved toward the south coastal zone. Statues are found along transport roads in supine, lateral and prone positions. Where they were appar- ently being moved uphill they are now lying generally supine with the base toward the hill. On the other hand, when they were being moved down- hill, they are generally in a prone position with the base upslope. The orientation of the heads of the majority of figures is away from the quarry, but there is no consistent pattern to be seen. In at least three cases, there are groups of from two to four statues in relatively close prox- imity to one another. Statues in these clusters are usually in varying posi- tions, and occasionally they lie at an- gles to one another, giving the im- pression that one statue was being manipulated to move around another. Several statues have rubble of var- ying sizes placed beneath them or in strategic places near the face or the base. Such evidence suggests that they were in the process of either being raised or repositioned. Bases of some of the statues have notches taken out of opposing sides near the bottom, suggesting that poles were positioned there as levers. Recently, Heyerdahl has moved two re-erected statues on Easter Is- land approximately four meters each in an upright position. H*e affixed ropes to the statues' necks and tilted and swiveled them forward, one set of ropes on one side of the statue being manipulated each time. The base shapes of neither of these statues had been documented prior to resto- ration and both had been moved fre- quently in the past. There is absolutely no indication on any of the "in transport" statues of wear patterns on the bases, necks or upper torsos which would confirm the use of an upright transport method. Given the nature of the ter- rain, the distance involved, and posi- tion, orientation and condition of the figures, it is highly unlikely that stat- ues were transported upright between quarry and platform. An examination of the relation- ship between the patterns of breaks and the bedding of the tuff of statues "intransport" does, however, suggest that some statues fell from an upright or nearly upright position. Records of early European observers also sug- gest the possibility that some stat- ues were standing upright between quarry and platform destination. What this means is not that they were being moved in this way, but rather that they may have been temporarily in that position for reasons not archae- ologically evident. All carved objects in Polynesia were intimately linked with sacred chants. Any carving might capture the spiritual essence conveyed in a chant and thus acquire and enhance the mana of the owner or the carver. Prescribed ritual was rigidly followed, and any mistake in that ritual was cause for, at the very least, the abandonment of the project. So why were statues simply left "in transit?" It is possible that some statues may have been abandoned due to ritual failure. Lack of resources, lineage or life crises, transport prob- lems or any combination of these or other factors may also have been in- volved. Statues might have been tem- porarily erected in place for interim ritual, some evidence of which is pres- ent on several sites. All available stylistic and site data indicate that statue transport method varied with statue form, size and weight. No single method of transport was used for all statues on all sites. Statues "in transport" vary from 1.77 meters to 9.03 meters in total length, with a mean length of 5.75 meters. The largest statue on ahu- measuring 9.94 meters in total length- was transported successfully to its site but fell and broke before it was completely erected. The outside weight limit for successful transport of statues on the south coast is 59 metric tons. It is reasonable to as- sume that statues of up to two me- ters in total length could have been carried on frames such as those documented for similar uses in the Marquesas. Statues between 2.5 meters and nearly ten meters in total length were probably placed on a frame or sledge to which ropes were attached. The figure was then dragged, using a crew of approximately 150 individuals, over specially prepared transport roads. Some vulnerable portions of the stat- ues might have been wrapped during transport; there is evidence both on Easter Island and elsewhere in Polynesia for the ritual wrapping and unwrapping of god figures. Those statues of greater than ten meters in total length were not successfully moved over any great distance. Construction of ahu on Easter Is- tend was a practice related directly to the East Polynesian marae concept. The carving and erection of stone sculptures on platforms was an idea rooted in similar practices elsewhere in Polynesia, but which evolved dur- ing the unfolding of the unique Rapa Nui culture complex. Archaeological evidence and iconographie analysis illustrate that the impetus for this activity was an ideology defined as one of male, lineage-based authority incorporating anthropomorphic and bird symbolism. The statues were thus symbols of authority and power, and their posture, design, scale, and ma- terials all illustrate a complex com- munication of social, religious and political messages. Just as not all the statues were exactly the same in form and style attributes, not all messages communicated were the same. The design hierarchy and conse- quent ceremonial use of the platforms and statuary suggest some district or region-wide integration. The extent of political integration on Easter Is- land was probably a good deal more complex than the frequently sug- gested pattern of individual com- peting lineages. Further, the nature of power wielded by the paramount chief ( ariki mau) and the members of his lineage ( ariki paka) may have been more encompassing than previously thought. We are thus faced with the task of reassessing the nature of chiefship on Easter Island. One inescapable conclusion emerges from the data. Amidst the turmoil and terror of an island soci- ety destroying itself and being destroyed by social, political and en- vironmental factors, there existed a spirit of adaptation, invention and survival. That spirit and the cosmic notions which supported it were symbolized in carved stone. □ March/April 1987 33</page></plain_text>
