Steadman SUNY Cortland Cortland, New York Gregory McMahon University of New Hampshire Durham, New Hampshire Jennifer C. Ross Hood College Frederick, Maryland Southern Anatolian plateau sites such as C^atalhoyuk, Kurupay, and Hactlar have provided detailed knowledge on the socio-political and economic lives of their prehistoric residents. In comparison, the north central area of the plateau has been virtually a blank slate due to a relative lack of data. Our excavations at the site ofQadvr Hoyiik have added substantially to our understanding of Late Chalcolithic (ca. 3500-3100 B.C.) occupation on the north central Anatolian plateau. In addition to residential areas, excavations have uncovered evi- dence of large-scale non-domestic architecture, as well as regional and long distance trade. This report summarizes our findings from a decade of research at the site. We use archi- tectural analyses to describe the social and economic structure at this Late Chalcolithic re- gional center. Analyses of the ceramic assemblage allow us to offer observations regarding Qadifs involvement in interaction spheres that extended across the plateau and beyond. Introduction Data from numerous excavations on the southern Ana- tolian plateau, western Anatolia, the Balkans, northern Mesopotamia, and se Anatolia have painted a reasonably clear picture of the social, economic, and political systems of the Chalcolithic world in these regions during the 5th-3rd millennia B.C. The same periods on the north cen- tral Anatolian plateau (fig. i), however, were until recent- ly a blank slate that might have comprised anything from small farming settlements to emergent empires; the area was most often ignored in general treatments due to a lack of data (e.g., Lloyd 1967, 1989; Alkim 1968; Joukowsky 1996). Our excavations at Qadir Hoyiik have begun to fill in this blank slate and to answer questions regarding the nature of north central plateau settlement. Our survey of the Ali§ar region and Qadir Hoyiik itself (fig. i) reveals that while farming villages were present, there also appear to have been regional centers involved in interaction across the plateau and beyond. We assert here that Qadir Hoyiik was a regional center in the Late Chalcolithic (ca. 3500-3100 B.C.), based on ev- idence from excavations at the site and a survey of the re- gion. In order to investigate the nature of the Chalcolithic Qadir settlement, we employed a variety of methodologies used in present-day archaeological projects (e.g., paleozo- ological, paleoethnobotanical, and geomophological analyses) within the context of careful stratigraphic excava- tions. Details of these aspects of our excavations can be found elsewhere (Smith 2007; Chernoff and Har- nischfeger 1996; Gorny et al. 1999, 2000). Here we will report on the architectural and spatial analyses that allow us to describe Qadir during the Late Chalcolithic (LC) as one of several possible regional centers in this area of the northern plateau, and on the ceramic analyses that demon- strate interregional interaction. £adir Hoyiik in Local and Interregional Settings When we began our work at Qadir in 1993 we had no expectations regarding the Chalcolithic, having been given little guidance by the previous work at Ali§ar Hoyiik (be- low). Because Qadir is a multi-period site, with a nearly un- broken occupation from the Middle Chalcolithic (ca. 385</page><page sequence="2">386 The Late Chalcolithic at (^adtr Hoyuk in Central Anatolia/ Steadman, McMahon, and Ross Figure 1. Map of sites discussed in the text, and the Ali§ar Regional Project survey area. 5300-4500 B.C.) to the Islamic period (a.d. 1100 and af- ter), we approached the excavations with overarching goals that would help us to understand the entire sequence of oc- cupation on the north central plateau, not just life during the Chalcolithic. The LC occupational history is the subject of the data presented here; we have reported on results from other periods at the site elsewhere (Gorny 1994, 1995, 2006; Gorny et al. 1995, 2002). The Site and its Setting Qadir Hoyuk is located within the permit area of the Ali§ar Regional Project, an interdisciplinary endeavor di- rected by Ronald Gorny (University of Chicago). Various components of the work carried out in the context of this project are under the direction of the authors. We began work at the site in 1993 and, except for a brief hiatus (1995-1997), we have excavated there ever since. The mound (fig. 2) rises 32 m above the valley plain, and measures roughly 260 x 200 m at the base. It rests near the confluence of the Kanak Su and Egri Su rivers (both now inundated by floodwaters from the Gellingullu Dam); the land surrounding* the site today is arable and there is nothing to suggest this has not been the case since the earliest occupation in the area. The site rests on a ma- jor e-w trade route, and a less-traveled but distinct n-s trade route. The continuous occupation of this settlement for at least six millennia suggests that residents were able to practice a sufficient if not prosperous farming/herding economy, and acquire necessary or desirable goods from the nearby trade routes. Excavations in 1994 followed a 1993 surface survey; the site was endangered by the Gellingullu Dam and subse- quent lake of the same name, slated for completion by the mid-1990s. The lake was projected to inundate the lower reaches of the mound. For this reason we laid out a 2 x 20 m step trench on the east side to retrieve a complete occu- pational sequence prior to flooding. Fortunately this pre- diction did not come to pass; the lakeshore has yet to reach the lower portions of the mound's southern slope. In addition to our excavations at Qadir, our survey of the surrounding region, carried out primarily in 1993-1994 (Branting 1996), aided our understanding of the LC settlement pattern on the north central plateau. There is a dearth of Middle Chalcolithic settlements (per- haps buried under alluvium), but a number of LC sites were identified. What is most interesting about these set- tlements is that they appear to exist in "clusters" with small- er sites located near three larger ones: Orta Hoyiik, Ali§ar Hoyuk, and Qadir Hoyuk (fig. i). These results are too preliminary to argue for "territories" within which existed core settlements such as Qadir or Ali§ar. The larger sizes, however, of Qadir and Ali§ar (and possibly Orta; the set- tlement appears as large as Qadir but is unexcavated), as well as their central locations within the clusters, lead us to the term "regional centers^ as appropriate designations. Besides Qadir the only other extensively explored mul- ti-period site in the region is Ali§ar Hoyuk, excavated by Hans von der Osten in the 1920s and 1930s (von der Os- ten 1937; von der Osten and Schmidt 1930, 1932). Von der Osten refers to the earlier levels at Ali§ar as "Copper Age." Most scholars believe that these remains date to the mid/late Chalcolithic rather than to the Bronze Age (Gorny 1990, 1994; Ozdogan 1991, 1993; Steadman 1995). The Chalcolithic layers at Ali§ar lay deep below me- ters of later material. The earliest levels at Ali§ar, dating to the later part of the Middle Chalcolithic and earlier LC, are from Levels 19-15M (referencing the depth of deposit), while the later LC materials are from Levels 14-12M.

View is to the southwest. chitectural remains from these levels are poorly preserved, though a few pise and mudbrick walls with some intra- mural burials in jars were recovered (von der Osten 1937). Until the 1990s, the prehistoric chronology of the north central plateau rested on the skimpy excavation sequence at this site. Work at (Jadir has substantially increased our knowledge of these periods. At the close of the 2006 season we had nearly 2000 sq m of open trenches (fig. 3). The step trench on the east side had almost 200 sq m of exposure and a nearly com- plete sequence of occupation at the site. Ten 10 x 10 m trenches on the mound summit and northern terrace had Classical and Byzantine remains (3rd century B.C. to 11th century a.d.). Old Kingdom, Hittite Empire (16th to late 13th centuries B.C.), and Iron Age levels (12th to 3rd cen- turies B.C.) were found in trenches on the northern, east- ern, and higher southern slopes of the mound. The LC and Early Bronze Age (EB) materials (table i) were found mainly in the lower southern slope trenches and in the low- est step trench (800.940) excavations on the east side. At present we have uncovered some 500 sq m of Chalcolithic and EB occupational materials. The North Central Plateau and its Setting As noted above, the LC period in areas surrounding the north central plateau is better understood due to a longer history of investigation and the excavation of numerous sites. Below is a brief overview of the world in which resi- dents at Qadir lived and interacted. EAST AND WEST OF THE PLATEAU Research on interconnections between se Europe and Anatolia, particularly nw Anatolia, has been pursued over the last several decades (e.g., Garasanin 1980-1981; Makkay 1993; Ozdogin 1999; Steadman 1995; Thissen 1993a; Pavlu 2003), and has produced ample evidence for Neolithic and Early Chalcolithic interaction between se Europe (including the Karanovo 1-4 and Vinca A-B phas- es) and settlements in nw Turkey (Ozdog^n 1994, 1998; Roodenberg 1999; Efe 1990, 1993, 1995). In the Anato- lian LC, interregional relations become somewhat cloudi- er, although evidence for a Balkans-plateau connection (via either nw Turkey or the Pontic zone) is discussed below. The late 4th/early 3rd millennia in se Europe are extreme-</page><page sequence="4">388 The Late Chaleolithic at Qadtr Hoyuk in Central Anatolia/ Steadman, MeMahon, and Ross Figure 3. Topographical map of (Jadir Hoyuk showing the excavation trenches; contour interval is 2 m. ly complicated; during these centuries there is widespread change in material culture and settlement patterns (Evans and Rasson 1984; Bankoff and Winter 1990; Nikolova 1999; Bailey 2000). The expansion of copper tool tech- nology, greater homogeneity in ceramic styles, smaller and more scattered (though more numerous) settlements, and changes in regional and long distance trade networks char- acterize these periods in the Balkans (Bailey 2000: 240-252; Parkinson, Yerkes, and Byucha 2002-2004; Nikolova 1999). Explanations for these changes abound, with Indo-European invasion (Gimbutas 1977, 1982) and socio-economic changes in animal husbandry (Sherratt 1983; Kaiser and Voytek 1983) among the most popular, though others suggest that the social changes are simply the result of centuries of internal, authochonous alterations in social structure. Of particular relevance here is whether the slow but apparent social transformation taking place in late 4th millennium Balkans settlements has any bearing on</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Field Archaeology /Vol. 32, 2007 389 Table 1 .

On the opposite side of the Anatolian plateau is Tran- scaucasia, which encompasses the present-day countries of Armenia, Georgia, Dagestan, and Azerbaijan. The LC "Ku- ra-Araxes" (or "Early Transcaucasian") cultural complex in this region is named after the two major regional rivers. We understand a fair amount about the material culture of the Kura-Araxes (K-A) culture including housing and settle- ment patterns, metallurgy, ceramic styles (see below), and unusual anthropomorphic portable hearths (Burney and Lang 1971; Chataigner 1995; Kushnareva 1997; Sagona 1984, 2004). Less is known of its origins (Kiguradze and Sagona 2003), and the boundaries and nature of the Tran- scaucasian LC and EB interaction sphere(s) are a continu- ing subject of research (e.g., Sagona 2004; Rothman 2003; Kiguradze 2000; Glumac and Anthony 1992). While there is fairly substantial evidence to suggest that a K-A interaction sphere included ne Anatolia, of interest here is whether that primary sphere, or a secondary one, ex- tended to the north central plateau. REGIONS TO THE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST The most widely known Near Eastern LC cultural sys- tem is the Uruk complex, emanating from the south and encompassing northern Mesopotamia, Syro-Anatolia and se Anatolia. The role that the Uruk complex might have played in LC north central Anatolian economic strategies has not been explored in any great detail, in part because until recently there have been few data available for analy- sis. That the Uruk system was dynamic and far-reaching is without doubt (e.g., Postgate 2004; Rothman 2001; Frangipane et al. 1993). Many have discussed the nature of that system, employing world systems models (Algaze 1993; Frank 1993; Edens 1992; Steadman 1994, 1995, 1996a), and alternative state formation frameworks (Stein 1994a, 1994b, 1999a; Champion 1989; Rowlands, Larsen, and Kristiansen 1987; Renfrew and Cherry 1986). It is not advocated here that central Anatolia was part of an Uruk world system "periphery5' or, in fact, embedded in any formal relational structure. In fact, evidence indicates that during the Uruk expansion the region later known as "Cilicia" (the area around Mersin) (fig. i) escaped interac- tion with the Uruk economic machine; residents instead turned to trade with the southern plateau (Steadman 1994, 1996a). This suggests the plateau was beyond the reach of the Uruk system, though Uruk interaction with se Anato- lia and Syro-Anatolia is well demonstrated (Schwartz 2001; Stein 1998, 2000, 2001, 2004; Frangipane 2001, 2004; Algaze 1993, 2001; Matthews 2003: 127-154; Pol- lock 1992, 1999). The height of the Uruk period is contemporaneous with the LC occupation at Qadir, however, and the collapse of the Uruk expansion in the Jemdet Nasr period (Matthews 1992) corresponds closely with the Transitional and EB I periods on the plateau (table i). That the occupational structure at Qadir undergoes some change in the Mesopotamian "Jemdet Nasr" period cannot, perhaps, be discounted. The ripple effect of a systemic Uruk collapse could have been a significant factor in an abrupt cessation or major disruption of a well-established interregional in- teraction network within which the residents at Qadir were intertwined. This would imply that LC Qadir residents were, if not dependent on, at least peripherally engaged in exchange networks extending out of the Uruk system. The southern Anatolian plateau, closest in proximity to the north central plateau, features some of the best-known sites in the Anatolian landscape, including Qatalhoyiik, Canhasan, Hacilar, and Kurucay (fig. i). The Neolithic and Early Chalcolithic of this region have been more ex- tensively researched (e.g., Ozdogan and Ba§gelen 1999; During 2006; Hodder 2006; Gerard and Thissen 2002; Cutting 2005; Yakar 1991; Todd 1980), and data from nu- merous LC sites reveal a period during which residents en- gaged in farming and herding strategies, craft specializa- tion, and long distance trade activities. The substantial amount of data available from the southern plateau sites highlights the heretofore sketchiness of our knowledge about their neighbors to the north, (^adir's ties to this re- gion, based on ceramic analyses, are discussed below. Architectural and Interregional Interaction Models At present we use the term "regional center" to describe the LC (^adir settlement. This implies that Qadir was pro- portionately bigger than surrounding communities, and that it may have functioned in some fashion as a type of economic center, perhaps a regional market or a nodal dis-</page><page sequence="6">390 The Late Chaleolithic at Qadtr Hoyiik in Central Anatolia/ Steadman, McMahon, and Ross tribution center for long range trade goods. Embedded in such a term is also the possibility that some type of central power or leader may have resided at Qadir as well. This leads us into larger issues of defining and identifying socio- economic and political structures at prehistoric settle- ments. Constructing models to explain the origins of social complexity is a dynamic area of research (e.g., Chapman 2003; Trigger 2003; Runciman 2001; Feinman and Nichols 2004; Parkinson 2002). Numerous authors urge archaeologists not to confine studies of societal complexi- ty to analyses of standard political hierarchies and mecha- nisms of economic control, but to consider other avenues of research as well (e.g., Feinman 1991, 2001; Crumley 2001; Yoffee 1993; Clark and Perry 1990; Stein 1999a, 1999b; Haas 2001). Such research foci relevant to our own analyses would include patterns of goods distribution, ev- idence of social stratification, the role of religion and ritu- al in the community, and mechanisms of labor output for public works. We have endeavored to take all of these is- sues into consideration to better understand the socio-eco- nomic structure at LC Qadir. Our next stage of research will focus on political structure. Two interpretive frame- works, one based on architectural analyses, and one em- ploying interregional interaction models, allow us to reach preliminary conclusions regarding the socio-economic na- ture of Qadir society itself, and the place of Qadir within any larger regional system on the plateau. Architecturally-Based Studies at Qadtr Architectural studies, employing household archaeolo- gy and spatial analysis, have allowed a diachronic investi- gation of the LC and succeeding periods at Qadir. At pre- sent the LC settlement has the following features (see be- low): a large stone gateway and enclosure wall; a well- equipped domestic complex located near the large stone gateway and wall; an apparently non- or partially non- domestic complex dealing, in some fashion, with ceramics; large courtyard areas; a non-domestic stone platform and pathway rising to an as yet unrevealed destination. In this area of only 530 sq m we appear to have domestic, public, and possibly ritual areas just inside a major gate into the settlement. In an attempt to understand production and consump- tion activities and intra-household cooperation, we em- ployed methods derived from household archaeology models (Blanton 1994; Wilk and Rathje 1982). Commu- nity production units can be deduced through an evalua- tion of relationships between dwellings and of other at- tributes as indicators of shared work (e.g., Flannery 1972; Byrd 2000; Kent 1990; Rapoport 1990; Steadman 1996b, 2000). Shared storage areas, courtyard spaces, hearths, and work areas can indicate a cross-dwelling unit of produc- tion, perhaps encompassing related kin-groups (Flannery 1972; Byrd 1994; Steadman 2004). The corpus of house- hold equipment in a single domestic structure, without ev- idence of shared space, materials, or activities, reflects a sin- gle-dwelling unit of production. A diachronic re- orienta- tion of the architecture, shared space, and distribution of material culture, may be indicative of a changing unit of production over time (from multi- dwelling to single dwelling, or vice versa). Presently we have identified at least one, possibly two, domestic structures dating to the LC. While this is indeed a small sample, our assemblages do offer enough data for preliminary conclusions regard- ing general household structures at LC Qadir. Architectural evidence can be used to evaluate differen- tiation in wealth distribution and social stratification across a settlement (Blanton 1994; Foster 1989; Lawrence 1982; Chapman 1990). In addition to relative house size and lay- out, other wealth indicators include material wealth display (e.g., exotic trade goods, decoration), labor input, and ev- idence for intra-household craft production and economic organization. Botanical and faunal data may also show variability across households or diachronic changes in sub- sistence/socio-economic patterns that may be indicative of social class differentiation. With only one confirmed do- mestic structure available for analysis, intra- community comparison is not possible at present. The well-provi- sioned nature of this household (see below) can be com- pared with contemporary households at other settlements, however, offering us the opportunity to make a prelimi- nary assessment regarding aspects of social stratification at the site. Our trenches have exposed a significant area that ap- pears to be "public," or at least non-domestic, in nature. The presence of public architectural works demonstrates the ability of an individual, group, or political entity to ex- ert control over labor (Bradley 1991; Drennan 1991; Clark and Blake 1996; Yoffee 1993; Hayden 2003). Such public works can signal the emergence of increasing socio- political complexity in the form of individual leaders or corporate entities (Schortman and Urban 1992; Kris- tiansen 1989; Adler 2002). An aspiring leader, overtly for the betterment of the community, will seek to coerce, ca- jole, or otherwise convince non-kin village residents to par- ticipate in public works (Arnold 2000; Feinman 2000; Earle 1991; Schortman and Urban 1992). In the case of an aspirant leader, the placement of such public monuments would be very visible and possibly near his or her resi- dence. Work at the site has already demonstrated the LC pres- ence of at least two large-scale public works, the stone gate-</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Field Arch mology/Vol 32, 2007 391 way and accompanying wall, and the stone platform ad- joining a wide ramp leading to some building or structure that was associated with these two features. We can offer some observations on the presence of these public works and interpret their meaning in the context of the LC Qadir community. Regional and Long Distance Interaction The interregional interaction model saw its fluorescence in the 1980s (summarized in Steadman 1995; Hirth 1996; Cusick 1998) and it is now a standard method for the study of trade and cultural interaction. We employed the interregional interaction model because it illuminates the impact that interaction with surrounding and distant social systems has on a community (Hirth 1996: 218; Schort- man 1989; Shennan 1996). These inter- cultural interac- tions take place most often within a framework of socio- economic (e.g., Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Renfrew and Shennan 1982) and sometimes socio-political interaction (e.g., Miller and Tilley 1984; Miller, Rowlands, and Tilley 1989). Such relationships can be overtly unequal, as ap- pears to be the case between various regions within the Uruk system. The interregional interaction evidence for the LC period at Qadir, however, lies in the context of "mu- tual" interaction, or "equal" trade. Available evidence does not suggest that a major power imbalance existed during the LC across the plateau. Our research assumes that soci- etal interaction took place between regions at the same lev- el of socio-economic operation with regard to engagement in long distance trade, specialized craft manufacture, and an economic base of farming and herding. Identifying the Interregional Areas Evidence for Neolithic-Early Chalcolithic interaction between nw Anatolia and the Balkans is quite strong (Garasanin 1980-1981; Makkay 1985, 1990; Ozdogan 1989, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1999; Steadman 1995; Thissen 1993a, 1993b; Pavhi 2003; Efe 1990, 1995; Lichter 2002). On the central plateau, excavations at several Chal- colithic sites, including K6§k Hoyiik, Bliyiik Glilllicek, and Ali§ar have all produced ceramics that appear to reflect in- teraction with se European cultures. Speculation on a Middle-Late Chalcolithic interaction sphere that includes the Balkans and the north central plateau is based mainly on ceramic stylistic similarities. Examples of incised swirling or spiral-banded designs, and punctate decora- tion, some with a white fill, from north central plateau sites (Esin 1993: 54-56; Tezcan 1958; Oztan and Ozkan 2003; Ko§ay and Akok 1957) find parallels in contemporary Balkan sites (Esin et al. 1991; Ozdogan 1991; Steadman 1995: 25). Though not conclusive, the body of evidence from the north central plateau sites suggests that some type of interregional interaction with se Europe occurred dur- ing the Chalcolithic period. Less well researched, but certainly relevant to our work at Qadir, is the possible set of exchange networks between the plateau and Transcaucasia (e.g., Sagona 1984, 2004; Ozdogan 2004; Rothman 2003). The Transcaucasian K-A Culture produced a ceramic ware of the same name, or Ku- ra-Araxes ware. Known as "Khirbet Kerak" ware in Syro- Palestine and "Karaz" in Anatolia, Kura-Araxes ware is handmade, black or red, and burnished to a metallic gloss with occasional low relief or incised decoration (Kushnare- va 1997: 43-44). Antonio Sagona's (2000, 2003, 2004) excavations at Sos Hoyiik in ne Anatolia have demonstrat- ed a strong cultural connection between indigenous Ana- tolian settlers and those in Transcaucasia. Sos Hoyiik has both K-A/Karaz wares and other material culture such as portable hearths and metal artifacts typical of those found at Transcaucasian sites. Examples of Karaz ware from both Ali§ar Hoyiik and Qadir Hoyiik suggest that a Transcau- casian-Sos Hoyiik interaction sphere may have extended farther west. Other ceramics with K-A parallels, such as a "knobbed ware," are common at ^)adir and at Sos Hoyiik (Antonio Sagona, personal communication, 2003). Field Methods Our initial surface survey was designed to outline the site's habitation periods. A 1000 x 1000 m grid was laid out over the mound and terrace; a total of 248 collection points offered us an 11% coverage of the mound (Gorny et al. 1995). Survey results indicated an occupational se- quence spanning the Chalcolithic to Byzantine periods with few gaps; locations of ceramics were used to guide our placement of trenches and it is notable that the 1993 surface collection reflected what lay beneath the surface. Our basic operational unit is a 10 x 10 m trench (trench names are based on location relative to a point on the 1000 x 1000 grid) and we use a standard locus/feature system for recording our stratigraphic excavations. Our Field Cat- alog Numbers run consecutively for the entire site, and in- ternal trench bag numbers give each find two unique num- bers on its bag tag, including priority status. A 0.5 cm screen is used on site. In general, 25% of Priority 3 (mixed) contexts are sieved, 50-75% of Priority 2 (partially sealed) contexts are taken to the screens, and 100% of Priority 1 (sealed) contexts (that were not bagged for flotation) are sieved. After cleaning and/or conservation, artifacts are photographed and drawn, and turned over to the appro- priate specialist for study. The majority of materials are stored in our depot at our excavation house; selected ob- jects were turned over to the Yozgat Museum.</page><page sequence="8">392 The Late Chalcolithic at Qadtr Hb'yuk in Central Anatolia/ Steadman, McMahon, and Ross Stratigraphic Phases at £adir Hoyiik All phases of LC occupation at (Jadir have thus far been uncovered on the south slope of the mound. The majority of our EB materials have also come from this area, though our 2002 excavations in the east slope step trench demon- strated a significant EB III occupation. Excavations in our deep sounding (eventually 8 m deep), on the south slope of the mound, revealed six gen- eral occupational levels (table i); the earliest level (phase Ie) was radiocarbon dated to the Middle Chalcolithic, 5220-4940 cal b.c, and the latest, barely 30 cm below the surface, belongs to the Transitional and EB I occupa- tion of the site. Primarily LC to EB I levels were seen in the horizontal exposures. At present we have significant data from the LC and Transitional periods, with more spotty da- ta for the EB I- II periods. Earlier phases are thus far ex- posed only in the deep sounding. The following describes the horizontal LC exposure in detail, with a general overview of the subsequent Transitional period. The Horizontal LC Exposure The easternmost Trenches, 770.900 and 770.910, have a Phase Ia-Ib complex we call the "Burnt House" with a radiocarbon date of 3600-3300 cal b.c. Faunal analysis indicates residents had domesticated caprines, pig, and cat- tle, but also made use of several wild species (Gorny et al. 1999; Arbuckle, personal communication, 2007). In addi- tion, a high incidence of turtle bones indicates a strong de- pendence on riverine resources. Paleobotanical samples have yielded evidence of domesticated wheat, barley, lentil, and bitter vetch (Chernoff and Harnischfeger 1996; Smith 2007). Hearths tended to yield high quantities of wild field weeds and forage plants, as well as some legumes with pods still attached, and this collection may result from the use of animal dung as the main source of fuel in such hearths (Smith 2007). Residents at Chalcolithic (^adir mainly relied on domesticated crops and a moderate level of animal husbandry for their subsistence needs. Excavations in Trench 770.910 (fig. 4) revealed the door and outer room of the Burnt House associated with the courtyard in Trench 770.900; two mudbrick steps con- nect the threshold to the lower plaster floor inside the house. The structure was oriented roughly e-w. The plas- ter floor featured a number of ashy charcoal patches possi- bly indicating the locations where wooden furniture may have burned in place. Fill within the room and between the floors included ceramics, bone, shell, and worked obsidian and flint. The entire courtyard was heavily burned. The source of the fire was a large hearth located in the se quad- rant of the courtyard. Objects from the courtyard, sealed in the roof collapse (composed of organic materials and wooden beams), in- cluded jewelry, spindle whorls and loom weights, needles, and examples of ceramic fine ware (almost eggshell thin in some cases). Two distinct piles of burned grains in the sw corner of the courtyard probably once rested in baskets. Animal bones, lithics, and whole vessels were scattered across the area, and parts of at least two basalt querns were recovered. Based on the amount and quality of goods pre- sent, this courtyard seems to have belonged to residents ca- pable of acquiring objects of high value. Rooftop and courtyard activities may have included lithic and textile production as well as a range of other regular domestic ac- tivities. Textile production is inferred from the numerous spindle whorls, as well as loom weights and needles recov- ered from loci atop the roof material (parallels to contem- porary spindle whorls are found at Ikiztepe [Alkim, Alkim, and Bilgi 1988: pl. 40], Ali§ar [von der Osten 1937: 187; Schmidt 1932: 52, fig. 61], and Kurucay [Duru 1996: pl. 152-153]). Metal and bone items, including jewelry, pins, and small tools (parallels are at Ali§ar, Kurucay, and Ikizte- pe [Schmidt 1932: fig. 19; Duru 1996: pl. 159; Alkim, Alkim, and Bilgi 1988: pl. 58]) were also recovered. After the hearth fire this area may have remained unoccupied for a short time. Lithic studies (Carlson 2006) offer a very interesting view into household activities in the Burnt House court- yard. Of all the cores retrieved for this phase of occupation, over half (18 of the total 33) were recovered from the LC Burnt House courtyard area. In addition, at least 356 flakes, 74 blades and bladelets, 66 tools, and a substantial amount of shatter and debris were also recovered from this context. This is in stark contrast to the contemporary area to the west, described below, where only 3 cores and far fewer blades and tools were found (Carlson 2006). The fact that many of the blades in the courtyard are of both the crested and ridged types suggests they are products of core trimming resulting from small-scale production (Britt Hartenberger, personal communication, 2006). Based on the locations of the cores, we can infer that the knapper sat with his or her back to the house wall or on a stool near the hearth. Since we have no comparanda from nearby con- temporary sites we do not know whether the production level was for single household use only or if this area was a small-scale, household-based lithics workshop. The far western part of the LC horizontal exposure has two enigmatic architectural features, a mudbrick and stone platform and a pathway or ramp. These two features meet at the ne corner of Trench 770.880. The pathway or ramp consists of a packed mud path lined with large stones. It as- cends to the ne. The mudbrick platform was built prior to,</page><page sequence="9">Journal of Field Arch aeolqgy/Vol. 32, 2007 393 Figure 4. Plan of the Burnt House and courtyard, the enclosure wall, and the gate area. or contemporary with, the "Omphalos Building" described below. The platform has a stone paving resting on an ear- lier mudbrick construction, and appears to lead upward to the nw where it meets the 770.880 ramp. Whatever was at the meeting point of these two structures is missing, at least in 770.880, removed by a large, intrusive, Iron Age pit. We currently refer to this area as the "high place.5' Its function does not appear to be domestic, and it may have served some public secular or religious use. Just east of these two structures, in Trenches 770.890 and 760.890, is a two-roomed complex (fig. 5) informal- ly called the "Omphalos Building," built as early as 3600 B.C. The Omphalos Building is named for the small Om- phalos Bowls with dimples in the bottom (fig. 6a-b)- a hallmark of the Qadir LC pottery tradition. Inside the en- tire western room were numerous wooden shelves filled with dozens of vessels of all shapes and sizes, including cooking, storage, and fine wares. Little in the way of do- mestic material was found except for a hearth set in a mud- brick bench; phytoliths from an organic mat were found on the floor by the bench/hearth. At present we are disin- clined to identify the Omphalos Building as entirely do- mestic in nature; rather, it may have functioned as some sort of pottery shop where residents and visitors acquired new (or used, see below) wares. Soil samples taken from this context, including inside the vessels, were sterile indi- cating it is unlikely that plant foods were stored in these pots. Some vessels, however, ranging from larger storage forms to the small Omphalos Bowls, show evidence of burning (usually an ashy residue on the interior). One pos- sible explanation is that the vessels were, in effect, "rented," and subsequently returned, perhaps after being used for some activity associated with the stone/mudbrick platform (and whatever rested on it), which was adjacent to the Om- phalos Building. In addition to the metal and bone tools and jewelry the finest example of Chalcolithic metalwork we recovered is a double-looped pin (fig. 6c) found in the gate area. It has no parallels at Ali§ar, nor are examples found at Kurucay, Canhasan, Alaca (northeast of Bogazkoy), or other nearby sites. A piece referred to as a "quadruple spiral object" from Ikiztepe has a similar design but different function (Alkim,</page><page sequence="10">394 The Late Chalcolithic at Qadtr Hb'yuk in Central Anatolia/ Steadman, McMahon, and Ross Figure 5. Plan of the Omphalos House, the stone and mudbrick platform, and the gate area. Alkim, and Bilgi 1988: 220, pl. 58 1/75-9). Close parallels to the Qadir pin come from the site of Arslantepe, in the Malatya province, where such pins were discovered in the late 4th millennium (Arslantepe 6A) "royal tomb" (Frangi- pane et al. 2001: fig. 19: 2, 19, 20). Frangipane refers to these types of pins as "twin spiral pins'5 and notes that they demonstrate relations with Transcaucasian cultures (Frangipane et al. 2001: 115). It is true that such pins have been found in Transcaucasian contexts (Kushnareva 1997: 60), suggesting that the pin, or the idea for its design, may have originated far to the east. Whether it came as a trade item, dropped from the clothing of a visitor, or was in fact a Qadiran reproduction of such a pin once glimpsed by a metalworker, is impossible to say. One other item worth mentioning is the corner of an andiron, or portable hearth, recovered in the 1998 season. Unfortunately the context of this find was not secure as it was recovered from erosional tumble in the upper reaches of Trench 770.900 (Gorny et al. 1999). This fragment of a hearth is decorated with the head of a bull featuring traces of red and black paint. Portable hearths are not common on the plateau and this piece may be further indication of Transcaucasian contact. South of and slightly down the mound from the Om- phalos Building and Burnt House is the "Stone Gateway" (with mudbrick superstructure) that offered entry through an outer wall 1.5 m thick and with large stones serving as the foundation. This structure was most likely built prior to or at the same time as the Burnt House. On either side of the entryway, built in the LC and rebuilt in the Transi- tional period, are small rooms flanking the gate (only the eastern room is illustrated in Figure 5 [labeled "guard</page><page sequence="11">Journal of Field Archaeology [Vol. 32, 2007 395 Figure 6. A) Omphalos bowl from Qadir, view of inside; B) Omphalos bowl from (Jadir, view of outside; C) Double-looped metal pin/fibula. room"] on figs. 4-5). This type of gate system is unique on the plateau. The rooms have plastered floors and had no domestic materials except stone tools. The eastern extent of the stone and mudbrick enclosure wall is missing due to a later building phase when residents destroyed the wall and robbed the stones to build their house. This also explains why the se corner of the Burnt House courtyard is missing. In addition, the northern half of the Omphalos Building is missing due to 2nd millenni- um building activity. Post-LC Occupation Following the LC occupation, the Transitional/EB peri- od settlement underwent some changes. In Transitional Phase He. 2, the Burnt House was rebuilt and the new building was reoriented on a nw-se axis with no apparent door into the courtyard. The Omphalos Building became one-roomed, opening onto a large courtyard. Both these complexes were also destroyed by fire near the end of the Transitional period. The Stone Gateway experienced two major alterations: first, entry into the settlement was con- stricted by narrowing the opening to approximately half its former width and second, at the end of the Transitional pe- riod the entire gate was blocked by a stone and mudbrick wall. The large platforms fell out of use or at least into dis- repair late in this phase. Following the Transitional period, architectural struc- tures were poorly built and the ceramic assemblage shows signs of form and style changes that resulted in poorer- quality vessels. Omphalos Bowls are absent from the as- semblage. The inhabitants in this period appear to have ex- perienced some type of disruption to their lives. Summary: Architectural Analyses ofLC Qadtr Though we can identify only one confirmed LC resi- dence thus far at Qadir, it yielded significant data for analy- sis. The size of the house itself cannot be determined, nor whether it was multi-roomed. What is extant appears to be merely the entryway, suggesting the house size would probably be comparable to contemporary structures at Ku- ru^ay, Canhasan, and Hacilar which range in size from roughly 15 to as much as 40 sq m. What is unusual is that the courtyard appears to belong only to the Burnt House. It is not shared with any structure to the west or, appar- ently, to the north, and the enclosure wall forms the south- ern boundary. Burnt House residents made their own stone tools and probably produced some textiles. The stor- age of grain (in organic baskets), the large hearth and the food processing equipment would indicate that produc- tion and consumption activities were centered in the Burnt House and courtyard rather than shared across residences, though this cannot be confirmed without additional exca- vation. As already noted, inter-structure comparative analysis,</page><page sequence="12">396 The Late Chalcolithic at Qadir Hoy ilk in Central Anatolia/ Steadman, McMahon, and Ross with an eye toward identifying socio-economic differenti- ation, is not possible at present. It may be that all the households at Qadir have individual courtyards and are well equipped with regard to material possessions. The proximity of the occupants of the Burnt House to the gate- way and platform/high place complex, and to the Ompha- los House, may, however, be indicative of their more prominent position in the settlement. The labor to build the gateway, enclosure wall, platform, and associated struc- tures may have been organized by aspirant leaders at Qadir. The nature of the power structure will be the subject of our next stage of research. The proximity of the Burnt House to these public areas, however, and the tendency of vil- lagers to live near what they have built, suggests the Burnt House may have housed one of the leading families in the LC Qadir community. We have used the term "enclosure" for the stone and mudbrick wall associated with the gateway. The only evi- dence that it might have been defensive in nature is the nar- rowing of the gateway in the subsequent Transitional peri- od, though even this does not necessarily indicate fear of attack. It is just as likely that the gateway and wall were meant to be ornamental, perhaps fitting the proposed na- ture of LC (Jadir as a regional center. The rooms flanking the gateway remain a mystery but could have been used by "guards" or "greeters" of visitors. The Late Chalcolithic Ceramic Assemblage A long-standing goal of our work has been to investi- gate the presence, or absence, of interregional interaction including long distance exchange networks within which Qadir residents may have operated. The ceramic assem- blage is perhaps the most crucial element for such research. Prior to excavations at Qadir, our understanding of the ce- ramic sequences in this period and region were sketchy at best. Evidence for Qadir's role in a LC regional interaction sphere and clues about its involvement in long distance ex- change networks are provided by the ceramic assemblage discussed below. Although the Middle Chalcolithic ceramic assemblage is not discussed here in detail (see Gorny 1994; Gorny et al. 1999, 2000) we can note that the Middle and Late Chal- colithic assemblages are remarkably consistent in form and style over the two millennia of occupation at Qadir (ca. 5300-3100 B.C.). Changes in the assemblage are subtle and do not necessarily conform to the period designations used on the plateau (i.e., Middle to Earlier Late Chalco- lithic, etc.). During the entire Chalcolithic, residents ex- ploited a clay source that produced wares ranging from buff to orange in color. This source appears to be some- what different from the one used by later residents in the Iron Age and Byzantine periods but similar to that used in the 2nd millennium. The clay used to make many of the ce- ramics during these later periods had a high mica content, but for the most part the clay used for the Chalcolithic as- semblage does not have mica inclusions. Whether the use of the two clay sources was due to preference or other rea- sons remains unclear at this point. Ceramic construction methods include hand-forming from a lump of clay, flat- tened then pinched into the desired form, and slab con- struction for some of the larger vessels. Coiling may have been used as well but few clear examples of this method were observed. As far back as the Middle Chalcolithic, and probably earlier, the firing of pots was carried out in a reducing at- mosphere, with the possible addition of smudging (cover- ing the pots completely during firing to cut off oxidation), to achieve a totally black or mostly black surface. The prac- tice of smudging is probable since occasionally there are "mistakes" in the form of mottled surfaces of orange and black or buff and black; other vessels have an orange inte- rior but black exterior. The Chalcolithic preference for these blackened vessels was remarkably long-lived, stretch- ing from at least the Middle Chalcolithic well into the Ear- ly Bronze Age, though by the later LC vessels with orange and red exterior surfaces had become more prominent. The large ceramic assemblage from the later part of the LC allows for a solid understanding of forms and styles. Small fine open bowls constitute a regular part of the as- semblage, and almost always have grey or black burnished exteriors; occasionally rims are buff or orange, possibly re- sulting from the firing technique (i.e., incomplete oxida- tion). The interiors of these bowls are more often orange than black, either left untreated, or slipped and burnished. A few carry an incision circling the bowl just below the ex- terior rim; temper consists of chaff and grit and is used throughout the rest of the Chalcolithic assemblage. Medium and larger forms include jars, hole-mouth jars and pots, and open bowls. Exteriors are usually black and burnished with occasional buff/orange at the rim or mot- tling in what might be firing mistakes. Interiors are rarely black but rather are buff to orange; they are often left un- treated, or simply smoothed, and a few are burnished. The "knobbed" ware makes its appearance in the later LC (Phase Ib.2) (fig. 7K-r). Primarily found on rims, these knobs are applied and then smoothed onto the vessel. Oc- casionally a knob is found on a shoulder. Whether these are vestigial ledge handles or a decorative technique is unclear. There is an occasional stripe of white paint (fig. 8j-m), and in this period red paint is found on both the interiors and exteriors of a few vessels. White-painted designs typi- cally occur in striped patterns (of ca. three strokes). The red</page><page sequence="13">Journal of Field Archaeology /Vol. 32, 2007 397 Figure 7.

It has the consistency of ochre or chalk; our best guess is that the paint was applied after the vessels were fired and that this powdery residue consti- tutes the remains of the decayed paint. Red painted design is most commonly found in a band at the rim (fig. 8n). It is in the later LC Phase Ib.2 that the so-called Om- phalos Bowl, also referred to as the "Qadir Bowl" (Schoop 2005), becomes a standard part of the assemblage (figs. 6A-B; 7D). This bowl, with a small dimple in the bottom protruding into the bowl base (usually 1.5-2 cm in diam- eter), is unique to Qadir. Many, of course, were found in the Omphalos Building, but they were also present in the Burnt House and courtyard, as well as in other LC levels on the site outside of the domestic areas. The bowls were made with well-levigated clay, and almost always were nicely smoothed, highly burnished, and well-fired. Some appear to have burn marks, but they are really too small for use in a hearth. Whether they were simply tableware or used for non- domestic purposes is still under considera- tion. General Compamnda At present the most complete discussion of the Chal- colithic ceramic assemblage of the north central plateau can be found in Schoop's recently published study (2005). Schoop finds that though there are similarities across the plateau, western and eastern traditions can be defined. Qadir, along with Ali§ar, Yankkaya (near Bogazkoy) (fig. i), and possibly Alaca, constitute the sites of the eastern tra- dition, though more westerly sites such as Orman Fidan- ligi and Yazir Hoyiik in the Eski§ehir region offer very sim- ilar ceramic traditions to those in the east (Ulf-Dietrich Schoop, personal communication, 2006; see also Umurtak 2005). Other sites to the south, such as Canhasan and Gtivercinkayasi, also have ceramics that are similar to those at Qadir, but enough differences exist to suggest that each area, or even each settlement, had its own local traditions. Thus far, LC Qadir ceramics show links with the assem- blages of plateau sites such as Yankkaya South Slope and Alaca Hoyiik (Hauptmann 1969; Ko§ay and Akok 1966), and some survey sites to the south (Todd 1980; Summers 1993). The long tradition of black- burnished surface treat- ment is attested at sites spanning the Chalcolithic, as at Gelveri-Guzelyurt and Kosjk Hoyiik, near Nigde (Tezcan 1958; Esin 1993; Silistreli 1984, 1985, 1989, 1991; Oz- tan and Ozkan 2003) and Yazir Hoyiik in the Porsuk Val- ley (Temizer 1960), and, of course, at the LC levels (main- ly 18-14M) at Alisar (von der Osten 1937: 52-61). Ce- ramics at these sites are the standard black- burnished wares common in the LC. In general, the hemispherical bowls, larger bowls, and simple jars can be found in these assem- blages particularly at Ali§ar. The peculiar rim knobs at Qadir are found at other sites in this later period of the LC. Only one example of a rim knob appears at Ali§ar (von der Osten 1937: figs. 83-84). Knobs on the rim, shoulder, and body are found in the Yankkaya assemblage (Ulf-Dietrich Schoop, personal com- munication, 2006), as well as at Alaca, Biiyiik Giillucek, and Ikiztepe (Schoop 2005); they appear at Qadir (fig. 71c) but rim knobs are more common. Knobs on carinated shoulders are found at more southern sites such as Giivercinkayasi (Giilcur 1999), and as far west and south as Kes Kaya near Orman Fidanligi (Efe 1989-1990); rim knobs are on vessels from Hoyiicek near the Burdur Lake region (Dura and Umurtak 2005: pls. 93-94). Many of the western plateau knobs noted here occur on vessels that span the Chalcolithic, indicating this is a long-held stylistic tradition on the plateau. As already noted, knobs are found at the ne Anatolian site of Sos Hoyiik (e.g., Sagona 2000: fig. 8: 6), and are stylistic features also found on Kura- Araxes wares (e.g., Kiguradze and Sagona 2003: fig. 3.15). Whether the (Jadir assemblage features Karaz (K-A) wares is a matter of debate. Nearly all of the Qadir assem- blage is burnished black or black and red, much of it to the high metallic gloss common on K-A wares. K-A ceramics typically are made of a micaceous clay and have a micaceous wash (Kiguradze and Sagona 2003: 48) as do a few exam- ples in the Qadir assemblage. This is probably not indica- tive of interaction, especially since the Sos Hoyiik pottery does not have mica inclusions. Qadir non-omphalos hemi- spherical bowls, both plain and with handles and small s- shaped jars (figs. 7A, j; 8g) are similar to those at Sos Hoyiik and the Transcaucasian sites (Kiguradze and Sago- na 2003: figs. 3.31, 3.35, 3.38; Sagona 2000: figs. 6, 14), but the commonality of such forms allows no conclusive assertions. The uncertainty may stem in part from the in- conclusive debate over the actual origin of Karaz or K-A wares. Recent studies suggest the black and red/orange burnished wares may have their origins in Anatolia rather than the Transcaucasus (Kiguradze and Sagona 2003; Frangipane 2000; Rothman 2003). Our few examples of stratified incised decoration in- clude simple and white-filled incisions (e.g., fig. 8h, q, u) (Gorny et al. 1999: figs. 12, 13). While many Anatolian sites have ceramics with incised designs (above), we do not yet have enough examples to yield solid comparisons, though there are several similarities to ceramics from Kabakulak, located very near K6§k Hoyiik (Summers 1991: fig. 2), a site most likely inhabited in the LC. Incised designs with white fill can be found at Gelveri-Giizelyiirt (Esin 1993: 54-56), Kosk Hoyiik (Oztan and Ozkan</page><page sequence="16">400 The Late Chalcolithie at (^adtr Hoyiik in Central Anatolia/ Steadman, MeMahon, and Ross 2003; Oztan 2002) and in various contexts at Alaca and Ali§ar (Steadman 1995). Southeast European ceramic as- semblages have similar styles of white-filled incised decora- tion including examples from Late Vinca contexts (Chap- man 1981: figs. 37, 40), Sitagroi Phases 3-4 (Renfrew, Gimbutas, and Elster 1986: fig. 12: 1-7) and several oth- er sites in Bulgaria and Hungary (Nikolova 1999: 174-198; Bailey 2000: 224-229: fig. 6.6). £adir white- filled incised decoration is not identical to Balkan exam- ples, but the larger corpus of central plateau examples (from Gelveri-Giizelyiirt, K6§k Hoyiik, Kabakulak [near K6§k], and elsewhere), exhibiting striking similarities, is suggestive of some type of interregional interaction. Summary: Interregional Interaction and Qadtr Ceramics In general, the Qadir assemblage shows similarities with the Chalcolithic plateau-wide practice of smoothing and/or slipping and then burnishing vessels. General forms such as open and straight-sided bowls and simple jars can be found from the Porsuk Valley to sites on the Kizilirmak indicat- ing a broad-based preference for this type of surface finish- ing and also, presumably, a reducing atmosphere in firing. Though we are in the early stages of building a substantial Chalcolithic ceramic chronology and database, we can al- ready see some unique features at Qadir, including the om- phalos bowls, and post-firing painted designs. At present it seems safe to suggest that while there is a pan-plateau ce- ramic style, settlements such as Qadir also developed their own local forms and decorative techniques, perhaps in- vented by local potters with individual stylistic preferences. Based on stylistic and form analyses, links to long dis- tance trade networks are somewhat less certain, but there is great potential for confirming interaction with further re- search. Sites slightly earlier than, and contemporary with (^adir, such as Gelveri-Giizelyiirt, K6§k Hoyiik, and Ali§ar Hoyiik have assemblages with strong links to Balkan styles. Fewer such examples, especially of white-filled incised and "swirling" decoration have been recovered from LC Qadir. This may be due to the small residential area as yet ex- posed; alternatively, the changing nature of se European social structure, including the restructuring of trade net- works in the late 4th millennium, may have also been a contributing factor. While an active Early-Middle Chalcol- ithic interaction sphere may have encompassed the Balka- ns, nw Anatolia, and stretched to the north central plateau, by the LC such ties may have been far fewer and weaker. That "Balkanesque" ceramics are present at Qadir, perhaps as "heirlooms" from previous generations, or as evidence that interaction was still present at much lower levels, sug- gest that whatever networks existed, (Jadir residents were involved in them. Excavations of the early strata at Qadir will certainly offer valuable data on such issues. There are enough indicators, including other materials such as the metal pin and the portion of portable hearth (above), to suggest that the Transcaucasian/NE Anatolian- north central plateau interaction sphere is a viable concept. Ceramic similarities between Qadir's assemblage and those from Sos Hoyiik, and by extension the Kura-Araxes mate- rials, are certainly noteworthy if not an absolute confirma- tion of contact. The similarities between Karaz wares and se Anatolian ceramics, as well as other materials (Frangi- pane 2000, 2004), may have some relevance for (Jadir's post-LC apparent deterioration. If there was a late 4th mil- lennium Transcaucasian/east-southeastern Anatolian inter- action sphere with which (Jadir residents had direct, or even indirect links, then the collapse of the Uruk system, which certainly affected se Anatolia, may have had a "rip- ple effect" across these other regions. A collapsing Uruk system, and a changing se European socio-economic net- work may have been significant factors in the concomitant changes at Transitional/EB I Qadir Hoyiik. Conclusion It is remarkable how the work at one or just a few sites can add significantly to what we know about an entire re- gion. The excavations at Qadir Hoyiik have contributed to the culture history of the later prehistoric period of this re- gion showing that the north central plateau, composed of regional centers and surrounding villages, shared a pan- plateau interaction sphere with links to regions beyond Anatolia. No doubt further work at this site and others will continue to fill in what is no longer a blank slate in this re- gion of Anatolia.
