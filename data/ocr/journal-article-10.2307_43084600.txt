Gurney [Paper first received, July 1997 ; in final form, March 1999] Summary. This paper makes contributions to long-established debates about the meaning of home-ownership and to the growing interest in discourse and language in urban and housing research. It outlines a theoretical framework in which analogy and metaphor are crucial devices in the social construction of home-ownership knowledge. The paper draws upon some results from qualitative fieldwork undertaken amongst a small group of home-owner households in Bristol, UK, to illustrate metaphorically structured, common-sense aphorisms as rhetorical techniques in the mobilisation of tenure prejudice. The paper concludes by outlining new directions for research exploring the cultural significance of housing tenure, and makes some more general observations regarding the significance of analogy and metaphor in urban studies. Introduction In using the arguments of common sense, speakers are arousing the stereotyped monsters from their slumbers (Billig, 1991, p. 20). Since the late 1970s, debates about the vari- ous meanings associated with housing tenures - and in particular with owner- occupation or home-ownership - have been influential in accounts of social change in urban and housing studies. Although contri- butions to this debate have become moribund in recent years, the privatisation and corn- modification of previously state-owned hous- ing continue apace in a number of European countries. Housing tenure seems set to con- tinue, therefore, as a significant variable or proxy in accounts of social change. How- ever, despite a considerable research effort in this area there remain a number of unre- solved conceptual questions pertaining to many people's everyday experience of hous- ing consumption. For instance, whilst we know much about the sociological and econ- omic significance of tenure change, we have little insight into the way in which cultural differences between owners and renters are articulated. We know a great deal about the current demand and future preferences for one type of housing consumption over an- other, but little about the way in which hous- ing consumers exercise agency in making housing choices. We know a lot about the Craig M. Gurney is in the Centre for Housing Management and Development, Department of City and Regional Planning, Cardiff University, PO Box 906, Cardiff, CF1 3YN, UK.

GURNEY social and economic characteristics of people in different tenures, but little about the im- pact which common-sense assumptions about housing tenure might have upon an individual's identity. In short, questions about the shared everyday realities, routines and ideas which go together to help to create an understanding of what it means to be a renter or an owner of a dwelling remain neglected. This paper makes a contribution in these areas by outlining the role which lan- guage plays in the social construction of home-ownership. It argues that metaphor and analogy are discursive practices which so- cially construct a housing tenure knowledge and that this is both stereotypical and prejudiced. The first part of the paper briefly reviews the existing literature on the meaning of home-ownership. It then draws upon an emerging social constructivist perspective in housing studies to argue that the selective deployment of metaphor and analogy has a crucial role to play in the social construction of reality in general and of home-ownership in particular. The paper then goes on to demonstrate the way in which 'common- sense' knowledge about home-ownership was constructed amongst a small group of home-owner households in Bristol, UK. In conclusion, the paper outlines directions for further research concerning the meaning of home-ownership and draws out implications for a more general understanding of the role of metaphor and analogy in housing and urban policy discourse. The Home-ownership Debate The debate concerning the various meanings ascribed to housing tenures has been well documented (Saunders, 1978, 1984, 1989a, 1990; Kemeny, 1978, 1981, 1983; Forrest, 1983; Richards, 1990; Gurney, 1990, 1991; Dovey, 1992; Ruonavaara, 1996a; Dupuis and Thorns, 1998). Whilst there is a wide- spread acceptance within this literature that the meaning of home-ownership is "likely to vary in form and significance between soci- eties at different times" (Saunders, 1986a, p. 328), housing and urban studies remain generally ill-equipped to produce convincing empirical evidence to elucidate the processes which cause the tenure to be culturally vari- able in different social contexts or to demon- strate the existence of a home-ownership ideology in the field. However, the recent emergence of a social constructivist perspec- tive in housing and urban research, and in particular a focus on discourse and language, provides an opportunity to approach afresh debates about the meaning of housing tenures. This section critically reviews four key perspectives on the meaning of home- ownership literature before outlining an alternative, social constructivist, perspective. Home-ownership and Ontological Security Saunders used survey evidence to argue that home-ownership is more strongly associated with pride, warmth, autonomy, relaxation and identity than renting, (Saunders, 1990, pp. 270-274). However, his methodology has been criticised by a number of commen- tators (Darke, 1994; Doyle, 1996; Gurney, 1997) who argue that subtle differences be- tween attitudes and meanings highlighted elsewhere (Kempson and Ford, 1995) are ignored. For example, whilst there is evi- dence in Saunders' work for the existence of a tenure-specific meaning of home (Saun- ders, 1990, pp. 272-273) and for a set of tenure specific attitudes towards home improvement and pride of possession (pp. 298-299), the data actually tell us very little about what home-ownership means to people. This creates problems for Saunders in his attempt to equate home-ownership with 'ontological security' - a term which is notoriously difficult to define (Franklin, 1986; Gurney, 1990, 1991; Dupuis and Thorns, 1998). Faced with an absence of appropriate evidence, Saunders uses 'pride of possession' as a proxy for ontological secur- ity. This shortcoming is compounded when he goes on to conflate ontological security with emotional security. Ideas of home which stress family, intimacy and love are well established (Fitchen, 1989; Allan and</page><page sequence="3">THE MEANING OF HOME-OWNERSHIP 1 707 Crow, 1991; Anthony, 1997) but the consen- sus seems to be that they are more closely related to key events in gendered biographies than to housing tenure per se (Gurney, 1997). So Saunders' research, although widely cited, adds very little to our understanding of the complex meanings associated with home- ownership. His reliance upon positivist re- search methods, and in particular his use of proxies, appears to be too blunt to reveal adequately the multiple meanings of the tenure. A Home-ownership Ideology Arguments that home-ownership has been politically sponsored to sustain a stabilising effect in civil society by offering a stake in a 'property-owning democracy' are well estab- lished (Forrest, 1983). It has been claimed for instance that "communism can never win in a nation of home-owners" (Hoyt, quoted in Harris and Hamnett, 1987, p. 175) and that home-ownership has "great utility as auto- matically interesting the owners in govern- ment, neighbourhood and the general community" (Woods and Kennedy, quoted in de Neufville and Barton, 1987, p. 189). Such arguments have inevitably focused attention on the relationship between housing tenure and ideology. Kemeny's work alerts us to the possibility that a home-ownership ideology may exist which, in some countries, eulo- gises owning at the expense of renting to sustain "tenure-discriminatory housing poli- cies" (Kemeny, 1981, p. 156). Such policies, Kemeny argues, are justified by the state and other powerful interest-groups through a taken-for-granted set of assumptions which falsify and mystify the way housing tenures operate. He argues strongly against the "mystical reverence for home-ownership" (Kemeny, 1986, p. 272) in English-speaking countries and demystifies a number of widely held preconceptions about the 'natu- ral' desire to own, security of tenure and capital accumulation. He is also able to identify emotive links between yeoman farm- ers and pioneers and contemporary American and Australian 'dream(s) of home-owner- ship' as evidence for a home-ownership ideology sustained by moral tales of 'the promised land' (Kemeny, 1981, 1983). But because ideology remains difficult to define or operationalise (Larrain, 1979; Abercrom- bie et al ., 1980), attempts to demonstrate it empirically are fraught with methodological problems. Indeed, Kemeny's analysis does not draw upon primary data from housing consumers. This is not to say, however, that it is impossible to demonstrate ideology in the field. Marx and Engels argued that "language is practical consciousness" in The German Ideology (1970, p. 51) and empirical links between language and ideology are well established elsewhere (Thompson, 1987; Billig, 1991). Richards' (1990) ethno- graphic study of a Melbourne suburb pro- vides a starting-point from which Kemeny's ideas can be tested in the field, suggesting that gendered and class-based discourses construct interrelated 'packages' of ideas about home-ownership. But perhaps a more significant finding from her work is that "catching ideology" requires a methodologi- cal focus on "people's words" (Richards, 1990, p. 107). The absence of a discursive tradition within housing studies is telling in this respect and whilst it is no justification for ignoring ideology, it might explain why there is so little convincing empirical evi- dence to demonstrate the existence or effects of a home-ownership ideology. Housing Histories and Tenure Preferences The coerced exchange debate (Dunleavy, 1986; Saunders, 1986b) is a recurring theme in the housing tenure literature. This debate hinges on accounts of choices (stressing the advantages offered by home-ownership) and constraints (stressing the lack of alternative tenure choices) in expressed tenure prefer- ences. Forrest and Murie (1990a) have con- tributed to this debate by questioning the apparent objectivity of tenure preference data. They argue against the simplistic pull- push view of tenure attitudes outlined above and point out that many households have monotenurial housing histories, so when</page><page sequence="4">1708 CRAIG M. GURNEY asked about attitudes to tenures tend to talk about their own experience rather than the meanings they associate with housing tenures in general. Moreover, the way in which tra- ditional tenure preference data are collected does not permit an assessment of the exist- ence of a home-ownership ideology amongst the people who respond to such surveys. So, tenure preference surveys, whilst important, fall short of providing answers to questions about the way meanings are constructed to inform housing choices in the first place. There is clearly a big difference between reporting or reflecting upon tenure prefer- ence data and understanding the processes by which these preferences are constructed and articulated. Whilst Forrest and Murie's argu- ment that tenure preferences are "reflections of real housing experiences" (1990a, p. 634) rather than the permanent and universal 'psy- chological desires' (Bhatti, 1984) - which Saunders' work (1989b) sometimes seemed to imply - was an important methodological contribution to the home-ownership debate, neither they nor other researchers have pre- sented data which sufficiently demonstrate the complexity of these experiences. The Etymology of Home-ownership Most recently, Mandic and Clapham (1996) focus on the Slovenian language as a social context within which discourses of home- ownership are constructed. Their work is in- sightful in making sense of what housing tenure means in a comparative context. Whilst they are unable to contribute to the debate with any conclusive empirical evi- dence concerning attitudes or meanings per se , Mandic and Clapham do highlight an important issue which might form part of a new comparative research agenda. Because home-ownership is very much taken for granted when used in the English language, there is a real danger of slipping into ethno- centricism if the term is used uncritically in comparative accounts of the social, political and economic significance of housing tenure change. The conflation of 'home' and 'home- ownership' in the English language (Dovey, 1985; Gurney, 1999a) illustrates why the terms are so resistant to precise translation in other languages. If comparative research is to contribute in any meaningful way towards our understanding of the meaning of housing tenure, more research of this kind is essential. Towards a Social Constructivist Perspective These four perspectives have undoubtedly advanced our understanding of the signifi- cance of housing tenure in accounts of social change. However, the accumulated evidence remains unconvincing, or inappropriate (or both) to elucidate fully arguments to support the existence of a home-ownership ideology or a set of culturally distinctive values. There remain opportunities, therefore, for a social constructivist perspective on the housing tenure debate which might provide answers to questions exploring the actions, thoughts, meanings and interpretations of individuals in different housing consumption locations. The possibilities such a perspective could offer are sketched out below. The Social Constructivist Perspective There has been a resurgence of interest in interpretative perspectives in urban research during the 1990s (Franklin, 1990; Jacobs, 1993; Ratner, 1996). Within housing studies, this trend can be seen in a number of contri- butions (Clapham, 1997; Gurney, 1997; Franklin, 1998; Hastings, 1998) which have argued for a social constructivist perspective influenced by the work of Schutz (1962), Berger and Luckman (1966), Garfinkel (1967), Strauss (1978) and Fischer and For- ester (1993). It must be made clear that there is no unified social constructivist perspective in housing studies as authors have variously sampled from ethnomethodology, phe- nomenology and symbolic interactionism in their arguments. Despite these important dif- ferences in interpretation (Sismondo, 1993; Velody, 1994), the social constructivist tra- dition can be defined as one which refutes positivist epistemologies in which social</page><page sequence="5">THE MEANING OF HOME-OWNERSHIP 1 709 reality is an objective fact to argue that social reality is variable between social actors lo- cated in specific social contexts, times and places. The perspective suggests that people play an active role in constructing and enact- ing their own realities of the "common-sense world of everyday life", (Garfinkel, 1967, p. 35) and that the construction of this 'com- mon-sense' stock of knowledge about every- day life is enabled through interaction with others in the form of talk, text, ritual, dress or negotiation. Whilst the perspective is under- going a revival across the social sciences, criticisms of the extreme relativism and re- ductionism it can imply remain well- founded.1 This has led many commentators to express disillusionment with social con- structivism. Burr's comments, below, are typical in this respect. Abandoning the idea of an ultimate truth appears at first a liberatory move, but brings with it the question of how one is then able to decide between alternative perspectives. In wishing to advocate some change for ourselves or for others, the usual foundation on which to base this is removed. How can we say, for example, that certain groups are oppressed, if these 'groups' and their 'oppression' are con- structions which can have no greater claim to truth than any other? (Burr, 1998, p. 14). However, the privileging of social action over social structure need not necessarily seek to deny the existence of structural in- equalities or the promotion of reductionist explanations. Recent contributions within housing studies (see Jacobs, 1997, for a re- view), have drawn upon Giddens' (1984) structuration theory to argue for a 'duality of structure', whereby agency is inevitably con- tingent upon competing interests and the out- come of political and ideological conflicts at the structural level (Clapham, 1997) and upon Foucaultian and post-Saussurian linguistic theory (Foucault, 1972, 1980; Fair- clough, 1992; Lemke, 1995), to argue a con- nection between language and the exercise of power (Hastings, 1998). The social constructivist perspective in housing studies has been used in a number of different ways. Franklin and Clapham (1997) use it in an examination of housing manage- ment as an occupational role; Franklin (1998) uses it to highlight the ambiguities and uncertainties in professional discourses which bedevil the delivery of a coherent housing service; Clapham (1997) uses it to challenge the taken-for-granted assumptions about the scope of housing management re- search; Allen (1997) draws on it in a multi- level analysis of decision-making in community care and housing policy; and Gurney (1997) and Somerville (1997) adopt social constructivist perspectives in papers on the meaning of home. A specific focus on language and discourse is exemplified in a number of other contributions. Jacobs and Manzi (1996) outline a methodological framework for an analysis of the vocabulary of housing policy, whilst close textual studies of policy documents undertaken by Hastings (1998) and Gurney (1999a) demonstrate the exercise of knowledge and power in housing policy discourse. Thus far, this emerging social constructivist tradition in housing and urban research has neglected the significance of metaphor and analogy. The possibilities offered by a specific consideration of these linguistic devices are outlined below. Analogy, Metaphor and the Social Constructivist Perspective This section of the paper draws on a wide- ranging literature to establish the significance of metaphor in the social construction of reality. Analogy and metaphor are common linguistic devices which allow one concept or object to be explained in terms of another through cross-domain mapping. Analogy al- lows an explanation of an unfamiliar concept by directly likening it to a familiar one (a [bird's] nest is like a [person's] house), whilst a metaphor is an explanation of an unfamiliar concept made by likening it to the characteristics of a familiar one (an English- man's [sic] home is his castle). Despite an extensive literature on the significance of</page><page sequence="6">1710 CRAIG M. GURNEY analogy and metaphor elsewhere (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980; Morgan, 1986, 1993; Lakoff and Turner, 1989; Barnes and Duncan, 1992; Demeriti, 1994; Holy oak and Thagard, 1995; Grant and Oswick, 1996; Cresswell, 1997; McCourt, 1997; Drummond, 1998), the recent focus on language and discourse in urban and housing studies has remained silent on the role of these devices. A reading of the existing literature in this area suggests that analogy and metaphor are crucial in the social construction of reality in four ways. First, metaphors both constrain and enable creative thought. Morgan argues that meta- phor is much more than a stylistic affectation to embellish discourse and that its use implies a way of thinking and a way of seeing that pervade how we understand our world generally (Morgan, 1986, p. 12). The literature on metaphor suggests that the persistent use of one metaphor over another constructs a partial account of the concept under consideration. Metaphors simply high- light points of correspondence between phe- nomena, but can never offer exact replicas otherwise the metaphor becomes redundant (Drummond, 1998, p. 744). Metaphors are, therefore, necessarily partial in the comparative understandings they offer. Secondly, metaphors and analogies define and hold social groups together to make "common place scenes visible" (Garfinkel, 1967, p. 36). Holyoak and Thagard (1995, pp. 211-216) demonstrate this in a review of the metaphorical extension of fables, proverbs and aphorisms, arguing that they play a prominent role in building and main- taining a "shared web of culture". They ar- gue that everyday aphorisms act as a shorthand for 'common-sense' social rela- tionships and that they sometimes become so familiar that the original metaphor is lost sight of. Thus, an understanding of the ex- pression 'sour grapes' does not require a knowledge of Aesop's fable in which a fox wants to reach some grapes, but on failing claims that (s)he doesn't want them anyway because they are sour (Aesop, 1996, p. 1). Crucially, the expression 'sour grapes' is widely understood even by people with no knowledge of the fable. Thirdly, metaphors can be deployed as an inherently political project. Hastings (1998, p. 196) has recently pointed out that elements of language such as metaphors and analogies are not only 'ideologically significant', but that their selective and deliberate deployment lets them do 'ideological work' for the peo- ple that use them. Similarly, Cresswell (1997) argues that the selective use of some metaphors rather than others is of huge sig- nificance in enabling the exercise of power and resistance relations. Cresswell's focus on metaphor/analogy is much more explicit than Hastings' and he is thus able to elucidate his argument in relation to a range of metaphors of displacement where 'out-of-place' popula- tions are constructed as marginal by more powerful groups. He draws heavily upon an analysis of American inner-city, anti-poverty strategies which seek the removal of out-of- place social groups and which are legitimised by reference to 'weeding' and 'seeding' metaphors. Fourthly, metaphor and analogy can be conceptualised within a framework of the so-called rhetorical turn in the social sciences (Simmons, 1990) which has seen a revival of interest in the classical rhetoric of intellectu- als such as Aristotle and Protagoras (Billig, 1991). Aristotle's (1909) rhetorical theory, for example, explores the connections be- tween common sense and opinion-giving. Aristotle argued that successful appeals to common sense could be achieved through value-laden and clichéd maxims or apho- risms which add a moral quality to our speech (Billig, 1991, pp. 20-21, 129). The 'argumentative' aspect of rhetoric is crucial and is summed up in Protagoras' maxim that 'there are two sides to every story' (Billig, 1991, p. 46). The central feature of Billig' s rhetorical psychology is a focus upon the everyday phrases which express values within argumentative discourse and, in par- ticular, the social construction of racial preju- dice. This association of common sense with morality and prejudice appears crucial for any analysis of discourse, but particularly</page><page sequence="7">THE MEANING OF HOME-OWNERSHIP 1711 metaphor and analogy, for although Billig does not focus on them explicitly, these linguistic devices offer enormous rhetorical possibilities. In demonstrating that analogies and metaphors provide a means by which reality can be socially constructed, the foregoing review has illustrated that these linguistic devices are neither an affectation, nor trivial, nor benign. Moreover, when used as part of a value-laden aphorism, it is suggested that they might also contribute towards the social construction of deeply prejudiced opinion. The next section of the paper explores these propositions in an analysis of some home- owners' talk about their own housing and of the differences between rental tenures and ownership. Socio-tenurial Rhetoric and Housing Tenure Aphorisms in the Social Construc- tion of Home-ownership Knowledge and Tenure Prejudice This part of the paper illustrates a social constructivist perspective on home-owner- ship. It is informed by the foregoing theoreti- cal material, reflections on the experience of conducting qualitative research and upon an analysis of the results which this research yielded. It reports some findings from a small purposive sample of working-class home-owners in St George, Bristol, to illus- trate the role of language in the social con- struction of home-ownership knowledge.2 It is important to stress that these findings are intended to be illustrative and form part of a much larger data set. The data reported here are based on the results of a series of semi- structured interviews with 52 individuals in 27 households and a further series of in- depth interviews with 8 individuals in 4 households. Because of the size of the sam- ple and the nature of the sample frame, these results should not be regarded as necessary evidence of any universal trends. The data are appropriate, however, for the purposes of this particular paper since they demonstrate the way in which metaphor and analogy were crucial in the social construction of some peoples' understanding of housing tenures. The results reveal three things. First, that understandings of home- ownership were metaphorically structured around a series of aphorisms which func- tioned as a shorthand for expressing com- mon-place attitudes towards housing tenures. Secondly, that the existence of a shared web of culture could be identified in the metaphorically informed rhetoric which posi- tively associated home-ownership with a moral responsibility to look after property. Thirdly, discourses which negatively associ- ated tenants with profligacy and waste were sustained by metaphors, analogy and moral tales to socially-construct an explicit tenure prejudice. A home-spun Philosophy? Socio-tenurial Rhetoric Primary data collected to elucidate the mean- ing of home-ownership for the purposes of this research and work undertaken elsewhere seem to be characterised by a striking con- gruence in the use of certain aphorisms suggestive of a socio-tenurial rhetoric. For example, the aphorisms presented in Table 1 were all used to justify an expressed prefer- ence for ownership over rental tenures in the St George fieldwork and are strikingly simi- lar to those quoted in Saunders' (1990) re- search. They also support Richards' findings on the existence of a set of home-ownership 'international keywords' commonly used by Table 1. Some common housing tenure aphorisms An Englishman's home is his castle. It's yours at the end of the day. If it's yours [then] you [can] do more to it. It's an investment for the future. Renting' s [just] money down the drain. Rent[ing']s [just] dead money. Note : These expressions are examples of aphorisms reported in the St George fieldwork which were recorded verbatim , on more than 12 separate occasions and (on each occasion) in different households.</page><page sequence="8">1712 CRAIG M. GURNEY research subjects (Richards, 1990, pp. 118- 123). Elsewhere, it has been argued that these aphorisms were "conversational utter- ances" (Forrest, 1983, p. 205) integral in maintaining the ideological support for home-ownership and the 'right-to-buy' in the UK and that the subsequent debate on housing tenures has been denuded and oversimplified as a result of their continued use. Rather than dismissing these common- place aphorisms as trivial anecdotes or dilut- ing their salience in a crude frequency count, an analysis of their usage is offered below to highlight how they socially constructed home-ownership knowledge amongst the people interviewed in St George. It is import- ant to emphasise here that these aphorisms are not paraphrases but are, in fact, verbatim expressions used with an astonishing consist- ency in the St George fieldwork (Gurney, 1995). The two extracts below demonstrate how these aphorisms were deployed. CMG So you're saying that owning makes a difference then? Mr Moss Yes, because it's yours ' at the end of the day isn't it? CMG Can you expand on that a bit for me? Mr Moss Yes. ... [pause] Well you've got something to show for it , you know, er, for all your work and effort, you know, and an Englishman's home is his castle isn't it? CMG What do you mean by that? Mr Moss Eh? . . . What 'An English- man' s home is his castle'? CMG Yes I Mr Moss ... Well, um, it means that it's : • yours' and at the end of the day no-one can take it away from you or tell you what to do in it. CMG Is that your experience of home-ownership then, being able to do what you want? Mr Moss Yes, I think so [pause] within reason anyway [laughing] well it's our castle , our home, something to show for our work. Mrs Miller It's an investment for the fu- ture, something that we can hopefully pass on to the chil- dren which we couldn't do if we were renting which is like dead money. CMG Why do you say that then? Mrs Miller Well, the house it's something lasting that you can pass on to them. It's also for the future of the family; and an English- man's or an English family's home is their castle isn't it?. CMG ...An Englishman's home - why? Mrs Miller ... [pause] I don't know really it's, erm, well [pause] it's just the best way to explain it re- ally, it's just the way I'd sum it up. I know it's a cliché but it's true. I don't know what else I can say really. Sorry, [emphasis added in both extracts]. Both extracts are typical of the way in which people in St George struggled to capture the distinctiveness of home-ownership. In the first extract, Mr Moss explains this by draw- ing on three common aphorisms in rapid succession. After being asked to explain the meaning of the third of these, he draws upon expurgated versions of the same three apho- risms again. This outcome was by no means exceptional. In the second extract, Mrs Miller draws rapidly upon three aphorisms in making her understanding of home-owner- ship accountable before she, also, exhausts the linguistic options available to her. These respondents were far from inarticulate, how- ever. Indeed, Mrs Miller is quick to point out the fact that she is reproducing a cliché and apologetically adds that an 'Englishman's home is his castle' remains "the best way to explain" the cultural distinctiveness of home- ownership. In asserting this, she shares with other respondents (both in St George and</page><page sequence="9">THE MEANING OF HOME-OWNERSHIP 1713 elsewhere) an understanding of the metaphor of the owned home as castle. The origin of this aphorism remains uncertain to most peo- ple, but it is undoubtedly part of the everyday lexical stock of expressions (just like 'sour grapes' in fact).3 It is so common that it is seldom given a second thought. However, the imagery conveyed - of impregnable ram- parts, familial heraldry and a secured draw- bridge - vividly underpins the ideologies of independence, identity and security so fre- quently associated with home-ownership. And whilst it may be the case that some home-owners feel 'under siege' or that their house might be a 'ruin', others undoubtedly think about their dwelling in terms of the security and permanence a castle affords. The significance of this metaphor is derived from the way in which ideas of private prop- erty and privacy are socially constructed in relation to the tenure. As a mode of thinking about home-ownership, it attaches great im- portance to the actual and assumed rights of people to defend their property, whether this be in relation to visual, spatial or aural breeches of a metaphorical moat. Table 2 indicates that the 'castle' aphorism is just one of many which might contribute towards a shared home-ownership web of culture. The possible effects of this are explored in more detail in relation to another metaphorical aphorism in the following section. Analogy , Responsibility and Home- ownership A central tenet of the literature on the mean- ing of home-ownership is the debate sur- rounding the existence of a home-ownership ideology. Earlier in this paper, it was sug- gested that attempts to empirically demon- strate or refute such an ideology have been limited in their impact. This part of the paper suggests that the use of certain analogical devices is crucial in socially constructing ideological standpoints on home-ownership which associate the tenure with a moral responsibility to look after property. Arguments about the effect which home- ownership has upon social characteristics are long established. Thus, the association of the tenure with a morality of responsibility in St George is not, in itself, surprising. What are significant, however, are congruencies in the social construction of this morality through the widespread use of analogies of responsi- bility and the repeated use of the aphorism 'If its yours [then] you [can] do more to it'. As part of the St George fieldwork, re- spondents were asked whether they thought that ownership made them feel 'differently' about their home compared to renting. Thirty-nine of the 52 respondents to a semi- structured interview questionnaire thought that ownership did make a difference to their feelings about the home. These 39 respon- dents were then asked to explain why they thought that was. The results are presented in Table 2. When respondents were asked to explain the precise nature of this tenure-specific feel- ing, the aphorism 'If its yours [then] you [can] do more to it' was articulated time and time again. It represented by far the most frequent response to the question and ac- counted for approximately half of all the discourses used to explain why ownership felt different from renting. This aphorism, like 'An Englishman's home...' and the other expressions listed in Table 1, is a clas- sic example of a rhetorical device. It is value- laden, implying that home-ownership is associated with a[n] (often highly gendered) moral responsibility of stewardship, hus- bandry and self-respect; it is common-place, being accurately recited with an alarming regularity and finding support in policies to extend owner-occupation to secure a general improvement in the total housing stock (Department of the Environment and Welsh Office, 1995, p. 16); and it is common-sense, being almost impervious to any further ex- planation. Most significantly, when asked to expand upon the 'If it's yours ...' aphorism, a number of respondents made this aspect of their home-ownership knowledge account- able by drawing upon analogical linguistic devices. The following extracts demonstrate that home-ownership was analogous to own- ing a book rather than borrowing it, to buy-</page><page sequence="10">1714 CRAIG M. GURNEY Table 2.

It's like a book. If you buy it, you'll look after it, but you're not quite so concerned if the book you get from the library gets a bit tatty and dog-eared. It's natural that if you own the book you'll look after it more. It's the same with a house (Mrs Anderson). People never look after hire cars. When you get them, they've got all sorts of dents and scratches and that in them. It's the same with a rented house ... like I said, what we did before, when we rented that house, we didn't do anything 'cause it didn't matter. You'd never dream of pol- ishing a hire car 'cause there's no point, but if it's yours well you look after it more don't you? (Mr Moss). We've had the television since we were married and we've looked after it and it still works now, see; so house- wise if it's yours you're more careful than if it belongs to someone else (Mr Syrett). These three analogies all highlight the com- mon-sense responsibilities of stewardship and husbandry which have accompanied the post-war growth of home-ownership in the UK. Willmott and Young's (1971) study of suburban home-ownership recognised this as long ago as the early 1970s. They la- mented the difficulties of getting male house- holders to stop DIY-ing and take part in an interview questionnaire and had this to say about the cult of home-improvement: The husbandman of England is back in a new form, as horticulturalist rather than agriculturist, as builder rather than cattle- man, as improver, not of a strip of arable land but of the semi-detached family estate at 33 Ellesmere Road (Willmott and Young, 1971, p. 33). This moral responsibility of husbandry and stewardship associated with home-ownership is not confined to the UK. Richards identifies it as part of a wider set of ideas which distinguished good and bad neighbours in a home-ownership suburb of Melbourne, Australia: Thus, People 'like us' make good neigh- bours; people who are not 'like us' threaten the image of the area. A bad neighbour is not just the obverse of a good one, but is defined in terms of the common values about property maintenance, noise and invasions of privacy, and always illus- trated by clearly lower class behaviour. [...] These ideas divide and are used</page><page sequence="11">THE MEANING OF HOME-OWNERSHIP 1715 to control those who have not been 'successful' (Richards, 1990, p. 223). In identifying these ideas, she adds to more recent findings concerning the normalisation of Finnish (Ruonavaara, 1996b) and British home-ownership (Knight, 1998; Gurney, 1999b) as part of a wider package of ideas concerning respectability, adulthood and suc- cess. This use of home-ownership as a meta- phor for respectability is highly significant and is developed more fully in a series of moral tales about local authority tenants in the next part of the paper. Tenure Prejudice: Housing Tenure as a Metaphor This part of the paper builds upon the pre- ceding evidence from St George to argue that a tenure prejudice existed amongst the home- owners interviewed for this research. This prejudice was actively constructed through the use of two rhetorical devices. First, in the widespread use of metaphorical aphorisms which associated rental tenures with waste and profligacy. Secondly, in moral tales which portrayed tenants as an irresponsible, feckless and undeserving, housing class. In the same way that some of the meta- phorical aphorisms described in Table 1 were used in the construction of positive ideas about home-ownership, others were deployed to construct negative ideas about rental tenures. Of these, two - 'Renting' s [just] money down the drain' and 'Renting's [just] dead money' - were used with a strik- ing consistency to convey metaphorical ideas of waste and unvalued by-products. Drawing on the results of her research in Australia, Richards suggests that the 'wasted rent argu- ment' is part of an international set of hous- ing tenure keywords. This argument "is so completely unquestioned", she argues, "that the catch-phrases come tumbling out" (Richards, 1990, p. 120). Her use of the ex- pression 'catch-phrase' is significant here and accurately characterises the deployment of this metaphor in St George. Indeed, these expressions were so common-place that their metaphorical status was obscured. What these international expressions about housing tenure are suggesting is that the activity of a tenant paying rent to a landlord is analogous to the rather fanciful situation of a person throwing money down a drain; even more outlandish, is the idea that money has an anthropomorphic quality and that a tenant, in paying rent, is responsible for its death. Metaphors, as we have seen earlier in this paper, enable and constrain creative thought. These metaphors are outrageously far- fetched examples of creative thought, yet they were constantly repeated as part of an apparently credible justification for support- ing home-ownership and rejecting rental tenures in St George. The powerful negative image of bank-notes being 'eliminated' or 'murdered' by a tenant is the antithesis of the positive images of 'husbandry' and 'steward- ship' associated with home-ownership. Taken together, these two contrasting ideas represent morally laden mirror-images of housing tenure. The juxtaposition of prudent/ worthy/good home-owners and prodigal/ feckless/bad tenants has implicit religious foundations and bears comparison with long- established debates about deserving versus undeserving poor.4 And in the same way that a racist argument about black people's unem- ployment might be based upon an untestable proposition that black people are lazy, so the association of rental tenures with tenants who were feckless and lacked self-respect was tautological. Cause and effect have bro- ken down here with a result that housing tenure is, itself, being used as a metaphor to mobilise cultural stereotypes about marginal groups of people. The nature of this logic is consistent with the argumentative discourses and the mobilisation of ideology typically associated with rhetoric. Billig' s (1988) work on fascism, for instance, reveals that simi- larly oppositional statements are routinely used in the social construction of racial prejudice. These arguments further remind us of an observation made earlier in this pa- per - that the use of metaphors is neither benign nor trivial. Prejudicial accounts of rental tenures</page><page sequence="12">1716 CRAIG M. GURNEY based on metaphorical aphorisms were some- times accompanied by moral fables of life on council estates; one is typical. One of my brothers moved into a council house, all new gas fires and everything; it was beautiful, and he'd been in there a month and it was a total wreck; he said "It's not our house. Why should we worry about it?" We put our cups on coasters, but they put theirs on top of their fires, and their fires were put in the same time as ours, and they had burn marks all round them. Ours haven't got a mark on them. If anything breaks here we have to replace it. We're not house-proud or anything like that, we just like it nice. I mean, we walk in with muddy shoes and that, but we clean the mess up. We don't expect anyone to do it for us (Mrs Lewis). The relative appearance of two gas-fired heating appliances is here being used as a moral metaphor to represent the self-respect, pride and morality of siblings in different housing tenures. Mrs Lewis' representation of her brother is a highly stylised moral tale. In stressing that she cleans up her own mess when muddy shoes are trodden in to the house, she reveals a rather exaggerated ac- count of the housing management and maintenance services her brother receives, but this .factual inaccuracy merely serves to embellish the simple common-sense morality of the tale. It is precisely this that makes it so effective in constructing tenure prejudice. Moral tales about life on council estates were widespread in St George. Stereotypical observations about local authority tenants in- cluded, for instance, observations that they iet that sense of pride slip', 'couldn't care tuppence' about their houses and had 'got no self-respect'. Given this context of local authority housing as a metaphor for a stereo- typical feckless class, it is not surprising to hear that some people in St George felt em- barrassed about their biography in rental tenures. Mrs Bamber vividly conveys the reality of tenure prejudice: Mrs Bamber Yeah ... we used to be em- barrassed, didn't we? [to husband], when we said our house is a council house. We used to say 'council house' [disguised by a cough and mumble] that sort of thing. CMG Why did you feel embar- rassed? Mrs Bamber I don't know, it's just that everyone ... um ... It just seemed everyone must own their own home. When my sisters got married after me, they bought their own homes from the council. We were the only ones living in coun- cil. They used to say ' Oh , we wouldn't live in a council house!' ... I think there was pressure on us, really, [emphasis in original]. Neither should we be surprised that the com- mon-sense rhetoric of tenure prejudice sus- tains a powerful socialisation process informing tenure preferences, as this extract seems to imply: CMG But why didn't you consider council houses? Mr Tucker It just didn't enter our heads. Mrs Tucker We weren't brought up to think like that. Mr Tucker It never dawned on us to go into a council house. We didn't even try. CMG Well, what about renting privately? Mrs Tucker Well, I don't see the point in that. There's nothing that's yours at the end of the day. Mr Tucker No, it just never entered our heads. As far as we were con- cerned, it was up to us to find a home. We saved hard to raise the deposit for a mort- gage and that's the way it was. We put off having a family until we could afford to start a family ... that's it</page><page sequence="13">THE MEANING OF HOME-OWNERSHIP 1717 really, that's what we had to do. The repetition of phrases such as 'It didn't enter our heads', and 'We weren't brought up to think like that' provide convincing evidence that in St George, in the early 1990s, a tenure prejudice constructed through metaphor, aphorism and rhetoric, which negatively stereotyped local authority tenants, was deep-seated. Conclusion St George is a fairly typical area of respect- able working-class home-ownership in east Bristol. The people interviewed for the pur- poses of this study were also, by and large, unremarkable. The balance of probability is that the tenure prejudice described here is not an artefact of the sample frame or of the locality. Richards' (1990) case study of sub- urban home-ownership in Melbourne yielded remarkably similar findings. And whilst it would be inappropriate to extrapolate univer- sal trends from such a small case study, this research does have important implications for the way in which tenure preference data are interpreted and, more generally, for our understanding of effective and latent demand in the owner-occupied housing market. A basic tenet of work on prejudice within social psychology is that it becomes self- fulfilling and thus can create arenas of disad- vantage impervious to ameliorative policies (Bethlehem, 1985). For this reason, it seems incumbent upon housing research first, to explain why one group of housing consumers was able so successfully to socially-construct an outgroup of another group of housing consumers and, secondly, to explain the im- plications that this might have for housing policy and practice. A Fairy-tale Castle?: Conclusion and Directions for Further Research This paper has been about home-ownership. In seeking to develop a new perspective on an old debate, it has been influenced by a social constructivist view of the way in which an understanding of the tenure is rou- tinely constructed and made accountable. It has illustrated the importance of aphorisms, analogies and metaphors in making sense of the tenure by drawing upon limited evidence from a small case study of home-owner households. The paper concludes in two ways: first, by identifying social construc- tivist contributions towards the housing tenure debate; secondly, with more general observations about analogy and metaphor in urban and housing research. On the Meaning of Home-ownership Four distinct questions for further research are suggested. First is research which consid- ers the social construction of home-owner- ship as a commodity, both at the point of sale - through an examination of the con- struction of home-ownership in the discur- sive practices of estate agents - and in the mode of access - through an analysis of the construction of the tenure in mortgage prod- ucts and lending practices. Such an approach would offer new possibilities for a compara- tive understanding of the power relationships constituted by the production, consumption and exchange relationships of housing. Second is research into the social con- struction of home-ownership in mixed-tenure neighbourhoods. It has been suggested that, as a consequence of privatisation and com- modification, some British state-built hous- ing estates constitute new zones of transition "where the rules of competition for (access to) housing are changing" (Forrest and Murie, 1995, p. 409). It is within such zones that challenges to the meaning of home-own- ership might be most keenly felt, and that we might observe changes in the way that home- owners construct a prejudicial tenure-specific housing reality. Third is research into the social construc- tion of home-ownership amongst younger people. We have already seen how, in St George, the housing choices of some people may have been, in part, an outcome of a</page><page sequence="14">1718 CRAIG M. GURNEY powerful socialisation process. A compara- tive examination of the way in which young people learn about housing choices and the sort of advice and information they might be offered by their parents, teachers or peers would enable us to understand the extent to which future demand might reflect the trans- mission of a previous generation's stock of socially constructed housing knowledge. The transmission of socially constructed housing knowledge from one generation to another may be a key to understanding differences and similarities in comparative housing re- search; do Swedish parents give the same advice to their children as English, Dutch or German parents for example? Finally, research is needed on the social construction of home-ownership folklore. Kemeny argued that attempts to challenge the 'myth of home-ownership' encounter a formidable problem because of an "ideology which is deeply entrenched in the housing folklore as well as in the housing policies" (Kemeny, 1981, p. 158) of English-speaking countries. The debate about the possible existence or nature of this ideology was de- veloped by housing researchers in the early 1980s. This debate largely operated at the level of vested interests and dominant ideolo- gies. However, the identification of contem- porary housing fables told by housing consumers may provide a way to enliven a rather moribund debate. There are clear op- portunities to refute or replicate the necess- arily illustrative findings from St George in other milieux, particularly in comparative research to identify housing folklore or morality which might conceptualise home- ownership or rental tenures in relation to stories. Before concluding with some more gen- eral observations about metaphor and anal- ogy, a note of caution should be sounded regarding the possibilities for comparative research. For any analogy or metaphor to function effectively, there must be a wide- spread understanding of the source ana- logue - that is, "a known domain that ... [an actor] ... already understands in terms of familiar patterns" (Holyoak and Thagard, 1995, p. 2). For example, in Great Britain, the notion of a housing career being anal- ogous to a ladder is dependent upon a shared understanding of a ladder being a vertical structure with sequential ascending rungs. Yet, the emergence of negative house price inflation and negative equity in the 1990s does not easily correspond to this source analogue. If comparative research is to make sense of home-ownership as a social con- struction, it must involve a thorough consideration of the techniques which hold true in specific locations at particular times. Analogies and metaphors used to make sense of housing choices in a highly collectivised social structure might be so culturally specific as to render them meaningless to householders in a highly privatised social structure. On Metaphors in Urban Studies Metaphors and analogies are universal and inescapable devices of expression and under- standing. They provide an effective mechan- ism for understanding unfamiliar concepts and ideas, but may also offer rhetorical and prejudicial accounts. This paper has illus- trated the importance they have in the social construction of home-ownership. It is im- portant to note, however, that their use ex- tends to all social constructions and that this includes some fairly fundamental building- blocks of urban and regional research. It is somewhat surprising that housing and urban research has remained isolated from this literature given that so many of the concepts which it takes for granted are metaphorical in their origin. For instance, housing policy re- search is frequently underpinned by the metaphor of the journey. Thus we speak of a housing career, ladder, trajectory or pathway. The pervasiveness of the journey metaphor in housing studies can be seen in recent contributions which suggest 'steering' (Bramley and Watkins, 1996) or 'moving' (Forrest and Murie, 1990b) the housing mar- ket. Urban policy research has frequently been underpinned by biological development metaphors. Thus cities are represented as</page><page sequence="15">THE MEANING OF HOME-OWNERSHIP 1719 growing, regenerating, decaying, in sclerosis or malaise. It has even been suggested that the inner city is itself a metaphor "for pov- erty and race" (Hill, 1994, p. 167). The bio- logical development metaphor was easily identifiable in UK and US urban policy be- tween the late 1960s and early 1970s where 'cures' were sought for spatially discrete contagious pathologies. But perhaps the best example of the taken-for-granted metaphor in urban studies is the system. Contemporary undergraduate textbooks are littered with ref- erences to the housing or planning 'sys- tem' - yet it is almost impossible to find an adequate explanation or justification for the use of this metaphor. The system metaphor - which itself extends the biological metaphor of the city as an ecology (Gaziano, 1996) - is now used with such regularity that it has ceased to have any metaphorical meaning and instead has become literal. It is a dead metaphor. This has not always been the case. Of the housing system metaphor, it was ar- gued that several "identifiable parts" exist "and that these parts are more or less closely linked to each other" (Mûrie et al.y 1976, p. 248). Of the urban social system meta- phor, it was argued that it "must be recog- nized as artificial" (Course Team, 1973, p. 5) Of the planning system metaphor, it was argued that "a system is not the real world, but a way of looking at it" (McLoughlin, 1969, p. 79). There is, literally speaking, no such thing as the planning system, nor indeed the housing system: they are only metaphors. Arguments in this paper have suggested that when metaphors are taken for granted by those who use them, then there is a danger that the things being understood are only understood in terms of these metaphors. Un- less more attention is paid to the taken-for- granted metaphors which permeate urban and housing research, the ability of the academic community in these areas to respond to new problems or to shape new policy may be diminished.

The research was undertaken in the St George district of east Bristol during 1990-91. The sample was deliberately con- structed using electoral registration and cen- sus records to focus upon a residential district with high rates of working-class owner- occupation and upon people who had moved into the area between 1978 and 1982. A postal survey was administered to 357 house- holds. This survey had two purposes. First, it was used as a sifting device to select house- holds for a series of semi-structured and in- depth interviews. Secondly, it aimed to discover something about the everyday use and understanding of home by asking people to describe, in their own words, what home meant to them. A semi-structured interview questionnaire survey was then administered to a sample of 27 owner-occupier households selected on the basis of the results of the postal survey. Interviews were conducted be- tween September 1990 and February 1991 with 52 people in 27 households. Interviews normally lasted about 90 minutes. Whilst some interviews were almost 3 hours long, none was shorter than 60 minutes. Each inter- view was tape-recorded and later fully tran- scribed. With just two exceptions, each household contained at least one school-age, or pre-school-age child living with their par- ents. All the couples were apparently hetero- sexual and white. One household consisted of a single (female) parent. The oldest respon- dent was 55 years old; the youngest was 32. Finally, an unstructured interview was admin- istered to a sample of four key respondent households, which were selected from the second sample stage. A series of two or three unstructured tape-recorded interviews were undertaken in May-July 1991 and were later fully transcribed. Each interview lasted about 2 hours. The shortest interview lasted about 90 minutes, the longest nearly 3 hours. A series of themes and issues from the earlier surveys and respondents' previous comments formed the basis for much of the discussion. The data reported in this paper are drawn from the second and third stages of the re- search. All names used in the paper are pseudonyms. 3. Partington (1992, p. 209) attributes the ex- pression to Sir Edward Coke, a 17th-century English jurist, who in The Institutes of the Laws of England (1628) wrote "For a man's</page><page sequence="16">1 720 CRAIG M.

Metaphor forms a crucial part of parables relating ideas of faith and righteous- ness within the Bible in Christianity, for ex- ample. See, for instance, the story of the talents in Matthew 13: 1-58.
