<plain_text><page sequence="1">Structural Analysis of Motion Pictures as a Symbol System CALVIN PRYLUCK Next to "medium is the message" perhaps the most pervasive cliches in the audiovisual field are the generally accepted but underdeveloped ideas that deal with "film language, grammar of film, syntax of film." Like the former use of words to mask ig- norance, the latter phrases are obscure enough to make them diffi- cult to deal with directly yet they contain enough truth to make them difficult to ignore completely. The idea of a film language originated in the aesthetic writings dealing with film where it was used as a shorthand for the idea that in some way film was different from other methods of com- municating experience, and that there were some kind of "rules" which governed the use of film. Most of the writers who spoke in these terms were primarily concerned with film as art and in this connection explicated normative rules for film in terms of the variety of techniques available in film which were not available in SThe research reported herein was performed pursuant to a grant with the Office of Education, U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare.

They were, in short, more interested in form than content. When psychologists and educators began to address themselves to the problems of film usage, they were more inter- ested in the types of information that might be conveyed via film and hence tended to concentrate on problems of content rather than form. In the process, the role of film was reduced to essentially a transmission channel. The possibility of film as a unique method of communicating experience was deemed a trivial side issue. In these analyses, film was one of several "mes- sage mediating vehicles." "Anything that could be said about a message-mediating vehicle independently of messages is already well known, and not very interesting in any case" (Knowlton, 1964, p. 39). A more explicit rejection of the idea of "film language" re- sulted from a review of the audiovisual literature and interviews with a purposive sample of four educational film producers. "In producing an instructional movie, decisions are made in terms of hunches and intuition rather than in terms of a set of well-defined production principles." "To refer to this [learning from visual stimuli] as a language hardly seem useful ... and may obscure an important difference between linguistic and nonlinguistic learning when otherwise defined" (Travers, 1964, pp. 1.15, 1.21- 1.22). At the same time a few writers attempted to make use of the contemporary insights of linguistics and psycholinguistics in examining filmic communication.2 One of Osgood's students, Gregory (1961), argued that language grammar and film editing technique could both be subsumed under common psychological principles. According to Gregory, meaning is signalled in such distributive languages as English and Chinese by changes in the sequencing of words rather than by changes in the words them- selves as is true in inflectional grammars such as Russian. In analogous fashion, Gregory argued, the major signalling sys- tems of film are distributive and depend on the sequencing of scenes. Each scene as photographed was viewed as creating a set of meanings ("a thesaurus") from which the editor could choose meanings ("words") to include in the edited sequence. These com- 'Filmic communication is used in this paper to signify those types of communication which have the characteristics of communication through motion pictures, i.e., controlled exposure of sequenced images, often in fixed relationship to speech, music, and sound. In this sense, television is flmic communication as are filmstrips and multimedia presentations.</page><page sequence="3">AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW : 374 binations of meanings form assertions the mechanics of which could then be understood in terms of mediational synthesis (Hei- der, 1-958) and the principle of congruity (Osgood, Suci, &amp; Tannenbaum, 1957). Writing about "film as non-art," Worth emphasized the infer- ential process between communicator and audience. "The mean- ing of a film is a relationship between the implication of the maker and the inference of the audience .... Meaning is clearly that which we infer from the film-from its elements, units and parts" (Worth, 1966, p. 323, italics original). As did Gregory, Worth (1965) distinguished between the full shot as it came from the camera and the shot as used in the edited sequence. Edited shots are sequenced "in ways that are deter- mined by the individual filmmaker, his communication needs, his particular culture, and his knowledge of the 'language' [p. 15]." In addition to the image, which is represented by the shot, Worth suggested as analytic parameters, motion, time, space, and sequence with sound, color, and other sensory stimuli as an overlay matrix. A similar approach, using the paradigms of linguistics and psycholinguistics as a research strategy in studying film, was proposed by Pryluck and Snow (1967). Where the others had con- centrated on the shot as the basic element, Pryluck and Snow emphasized what they called information channels, the classes of information transmitted within a film. In any film, they argued, there are two major classes of information which differ in terms of the kind of information they transmit. These general classes of digital and analogic information were futher subdivided into six subdivisions which included audio/video and verbal/non- verbal/paraverbal as category headings. Each channel or class of channel, Pryluck and Snow suggested, "may have its own syntactic and semantic characteristics, and a detailed structural analysis of each may be necessary [p. 64J." These analyses might be made directly by psycholinguistic techniques where appli- cable; other forms of analysis were suggested which were deemed to be applicable to the uniquely filmic information channels. Further consideration of the general problem of filmic communi- cation and the particular problem of its scientific analysis has suggested the need for formulations which could integrate the varied approaches thus far taken and yet remain consonant with the varied examples of filmic communication generally avail- SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF FILMIC COMMUNICATION</page><page sequence="4">MOTION PICTURES AS A SYMBOL SYSTEM : 375 able. The scientific cautions apply to the study of filmic communi- cation as well as to the study of any other phenomena. If one makes too many or the wrong simplifying assumptions the phe- nomenon will elude our grasp altogether. For example, it appears that while all of the several accounts seem to be talking about film or visual communication they are not all talking about the same thing. As presently organized it is difficult to believe, for instance, both the transmission channel views and the film language views. If film is a transmission chan- nel only, then clearly it has no unique "language"; if film does organize experience in unique ways, then it is not merely a trans- mission channel. While this apparent paradox can be resolved by demonstrating that both views are correct for the aspect of the phenomenon they are studying, other problems remain. How can it be demon- strated that filmic communication does or does not organize ex- perience in unique ways? What are the specific characteristics of filmic communication involved? How does filmic communication differ from language communication? Do the apparent differences between motion pictures and television "lie more in philosophy and practice of production than they do in inherent media differ- ences" as Lumsdaine (1963, p. 588) has asserted; or, perhaps, is the medium in some specifiable way part of the message? Previous attempts to understand the nature of filmic communi- cation naturally brought to the study their own orientations, pre- conceptions, and assumptions. The pedagogical approach assumed that film could be made to fit one or another learning theory paradigm, none of which was able to encompass the complexity of filmic communication. A member of the film research group at Pennsylvania State University in the early fifties said, "I be- lieve that we have failed.., .in coming to grips with the filmic essence .... I, as many other colleagues have, have read Belizs, and Eisenstein, Benoit-Levy and [other film theorists]and we have not been able to translate their ideas into testable proposi- tions" (Roshal, 1960, p. 117). Proponents of the aesthetic approach attempted to develop the idea that film was a unique language, but they narrowed their view unnecessarily by attempting a rule-bound grammatical approach; in their search for the "correct" way of using film they evolved normative statements which were quickly negated by example.</page><page sequence="5">AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW : 376 It would appear that a more useful orientation could be bor- rowed from the descriptive linguists as they begin to describe any new (to them) language. They first accumulate all of the dis- tinctions that they discriminate, and only then evolve from the language as it is used a set of categories which are susceptible to some kind of test. The use of pre-existing categories designed for other purposes can obscure the categorical discrepancies that exist between symbol systems. Even in a quest for synthesizing concepts an understanding of these differences is necessary, if only to know what factors are hindering a successful synthesis. Although they obviously work with hypotheses, modem des- criptive linguists make as few a priori judgments as possible; all they know of a language is from analysis of the language itself and from what their informants tell them about the use of the language. One way of examining the problems of filmic communication is to examine in detail the ways in which experience is translated into a symbol system. Analysis of symbol systems becomes pos- sible when it is realized that they are characteristically composed of some kind of units which can be manipulated through a series of coding decisions to form other units which in turn can be trans- mitted. We choose words to form sentences, which we organize into paragraphs, etc. Experienced manipulators of symbol systems are not normally conscious of these coding decisions, but the neophyte is painfully aware and the investigator of symbol sys- tems must make himself cognizant. The balance of this paper will propose an analytical model of filmic communication which may prove useful for this purpose. The model is analytical in the sense that it is concerned less with how film communicates than with how we might find out how film communicates. The basic attempt is to highlight the nature of the classes of variables that must be considered in any account of filmic communication. The model is designed as an attempt to explicate the relationships between the major compo- nents of filmic communication and the relationships which appear to obtain within these components. A fundamental assumption of this analysis is the same as that which appears to underlie linguistic analysis: each symbol system has a range of coding devices which differ along some dimension and that some of these differences are significant in signalling meaning.' s For a definition of meaning as used in this paper see page 383. Multistage Process of Codification</page><page sequence="6">MOTION PICTURES AS A SYMBOL SYSTEM : 377 Briefly the idea is that some differences make more difference than others. For each symbol system, then, the analytic ques- tions must be 1) what are the coding devices, 2) how do the cod- ing devices differ for various symbol systems, and 3) what differ- ences do make a difference? The last question is an empirical question and will be treated as such in this analysis. No attempt will be made to prejudge the case except in terms of the apparent existence of coding devices and the apparent differences between symbol systems. One further assumption should be specified. This paper views as invalid the widely accepted dichotomy between educational films and other types of films.4 This dichotomy is seen as being valid only under extremely limited conditions. Generally it is assumed here that communication through film may differ in de- tail depending upon the objective but that film qua film has general characteristics that can only be understood by reference to the whole range of available examples. It is clear that linguis- tics would be a much impoverished field if it attempted to restrict its study to, say, language as used in the classroom or to language as used on the stage or-what is probably closer to the case in the study of filmic communication-had two sets of otherwise capa- ble scholars, each studying one of the fields With little or no cross-reference. The analytic orientation of this paper, schematically depicted in Figure i, is that any symbol system draws from the environ- ment selected data which are organized through series of coding decisions into a particular communication. The minimum unit- the primary coding unit-is organized into secondary coding units; the combinations of secondary units available to a symbol system according to this view define the symbol system. Symbol systems have only a theoretical existence in vacuo; their existence as viable communications depends on some physical channel of transmission. Beyond the general symbol system and channel there are specific symbol systems which further define the shape of particular communications. This schematic is not intended as being definitive of any of the symbol systems seen as contributing to the construction of a film 'This dichotomy is accepted by both the writers on "film art" and the writers on "instructional media." See Kracauer (196o) and Miinsterberg (1916) for the former, and Travers (1964) and Lumsdaine (1963) for the latter.</page><page sequence="7">AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW : 378 FIGURE 1 Multi-Stage Process Model of Codification f-D I G I TA A L--- ANALOGIC q q q XqB ~Qh~ - enviromient - primary coding unit secondary coding unit GENERAL SYMBOL SYSTEM I I word -.

For instance, it seems clear that writing and speech are different symbol systems but this is not the place to elaborate that argument. It is sufficient to note that the system contributing to film is speech, not writing. Similarly, the nature of music as a symbol system in this representation is sketched only enough to indicate its relationship to film. The present effort will be restricted to an analysis of the gen- eral symbol system which subsumes all of filmic communication. Analysis of the differences between- motion pictures, television, and multimedia presentations is fundamentally a problem in channel characteristics rather than symbol system characteristics.</page><page sequence="8">MOTION PICTURES AS A SYMBOL SYSTEM : 379 Briefly, this argument suggests that each channel of transmission in its general characteristics imposes different perceptual tasks which may or may not affect the coding potential of the specific channel. A similar argument may be made for deferring consid- eration of specific symbol systems: each specific symbol system has general characteristics which may or may not affect the coding potential. Analysis of these problems depends, in part, on more complete understanding of the characteristics of the general sym- bol system. In general, the structural characteristics of a symbol system constrain or facilitate the restructuring of the environment in determinate ways which affect the functional capacity of the symbol system. The structural characteristics contribute to differ- ences between the ways in which different symbol systems make assertions about attributes, making some assertions more effec- tively and some others less effectively. In the ultimate case, cer- tain symbol systems cannot make certain assertions about certain attributes. The structural characteristics of a symbol system are mani- fested in either coding or transmission, i.e., their effect is either selective or general across a communication; both types of char- acteristics may be influenced by technical or social considerations. The technical/social distinction is heuristic; often it will be found that they are interacting to the extent that an attempt to assign an event to one or the other category proves a fruitless exercise. While both types constrain or facilitate the restructuring of the environment, the technical characteristics define what ap- parently can be done with a symbol system and social character- istics demonstrate what has been done. For example, any message can be transmitted via telegraphy; the final product will be all in capital letters and at one time the punctuation would have been written out. The absence of lower case letters and the spelling out of punctuation are obvious tech- nical limitations on the channel, and the fact that punctuation is no longer written out illustrates that constraints are not necessar- ily immutable. However, there are no technical constraints on coding; the coding selections can be made and the message trans- mitted with no further selective changes. The fact that telegraph messages are customarily charged by the word is a social constraint on coding that facilitates a unique linguistic form, "telegraphese," influencing syntactic structure and lexical choice. There is also for telegraphy a social channel-</page><page sequence="9">AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW : 380 CODING AND THE ENVIRONMENT Digital and Analogic Information constraint. Most people are not accustomed to receiving tele- grams, a fact reflected in the folk tradition that a telegram means bad news. Our analysis can start from the commonplace idea that there are numerous types of information in the environment. Some of this information we experience through our psychomotor involve- ment: we walk on a sidewalk or across a lawn; we ride a train or a horse; we are hit by a ball carelessly thrown by children. Other information we experience as continuous sensory inputs: we see and smell flowers; we watch a squirrel dart across the street; ab- sorbed by the sight, we neglect to look both ways as we approach a street corner and leap backwards at the sound of an approaching vehicle. Still other information we experience as symbols: we hear our companion on this imaginary walk suggest that we stop for a soft drink that we have just seen advertised on a billboard; or at home, a roofing salesman shows us a price list and explains the cost per square foot. In the environment we can distinguish as general classes two types of information. Digital information generally includes words, numbers, etc. They are usually socially agreed upon, arbi- trary units which can be manipulated according to fixed rules. Digital units are discrete and serial; fairly small units can be identified, which in use are presented one after the other. Rarely are digital units presented simultaneously. As arbitrary units, they have no particular significance apart from the system. Ana- logic information includes everything else. An additional dis- tinction is possible between the psychomotor stimuli and those we experience as continuous sensory inputs. This distinction does not seem to have any utility in the analysis of symbol sys- tems; hence, the two types of continuous data are grouped. Characteristically, analogic information is continuous and simul- taneous. The units are fairly gross with no apparent subdivisions. Analogic information can be viewed as being continuous in the mathematical sense.5 s The terms analogic and digital as used here are of course borrowed from Ruesch and Kees (1956). The terms are seen as describing stimulus charac- teristics whether the stimuli are raw experience or experience mediated by a symbol system. As such they are external to the receiver; iconic/symbolic can be used to designate the internal representation (Bruner, 1964). This internal/external distinction seems to be somewhat obscured by such terms as presentational/discursive which otherwise make a similar distinction in the nature of stimuli (Langer, 1942).</page><page sequence="10">MOTION PICTURES AS A SYMBOL SYSTEM : 38 Systems of Implementation No matter what the environment, these kinds of information impinge on our consciousness. At home, in the street, in the class- room--everywhere-we are bombarded by these varied data and information. Fortunately a selection process of some sort is con- tinually operating. A pair of lovers out for a stroll are not so likely to notice either the squirrel or the soft drink ad; if they do notice the squirrel their delayed recall of it would probably be in quite different terms than would the recall of a young city boy or a mammalogist specializing in squirrels. Another way of speaking of the selection process is to say that we code those aspects of the environment that are most signifi- cant to us. Coding can be defined as selectively structuring envi- ronmental data in such a way as to make it more easily usable, either immediately or at some future time. This is a consciously looser definition of coding than is used by some writers; e.g., Sebeok (1962) defines coding as "an operation, governed by strict and logical rules, aimed at gaining increased efficiency by having elementary signals organized into patterns of alternative actions [p. 431; italics added]." The looser definition is adopted to avoid prejudging the question of rules and their strictness which seems to be one of the points at issue in consideration of filmic communication. The environmental data subjected to coding might be raw experi- ence (an automobile accident), or a precoded experience (a news- paper report of the accident). In either event, the human being is a relatively efficient all-purpose coding machine; it can code most, but not all, types of information available in the environ- ment. Special mechanisms are required, for instance, to code the flow of bradcast waves. Bruner (1964) has reminded us that man advanced by utilization of systems of implementation which en- larged our capacities to deal with the environment. The systems of implementation enable us to deal with the physical environ- ment by extending our physical capacity or by adding a specializ- ed technique that we may bring to bear on the environment. A bicycle enables us to make more efficient use of the movement of our feet; an internal combustion engine opens completely new possibilities of locomotion. In somewhat similar fashion, the systems of implementation that enlarge our capacity to concep- tually manipulate the environment extend our reach, or change the way in which we may reach.</page><page sequence="11">AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW : 382 SYMBOL SYSTEMS AND TRANSMISSION CHANNELS Film as a system of implementation is often viewed as a mechani- cal extension analogous to printing. There are important differ- ences which weaken the analogy. When writing is reduced to the printed form, there is no way in which the coding is selectively influenced by the procedure. The printer may print four point type in light green ink on dark green paper or he may use a highly legible type set with tasteful margins. Whatever the typographic design, the effect is general across the communication. What is written remains substantially in the same code but in a more con- venient and sometimes neater form. It is useful to describe writ- ing as a symbol system and printing as a channel, using the criterion of selectivity to distinguish between coding and transmission. The distinction between coding and transmission is less easily made in film than in some other symbol systems. Only under limited circumstances can there be transmission without coding- primarily when the camera is used as technical recording device, e. g., microphotography or photographic recording of oscilloscope tracings. The controlling consideration is the degree of selection possible; where there is none, the camera is a transmission device. Under these circumstances, there is no way that the photographic process can selectively determine the outcome; the technical char- acteristics of lack of color, depth, etc., are channel limitations, general across the communication. Selection takes place, though, the moment a camera is pointed at most objects. There are, for instance, an infinite number of angles from which to photograph an object; the choice of one of these angles to the exclusion of the others can sometimes be highly consequen- tial in communicating semantic content. It is widely assumed in the aesthetic literature, for instance, that an angle shooting up at a person imparts a meaning of power to the image while an angle shooting down tends to emphasize the helplessness of the charac- ter. Whether these assumptions are valid is an empirical problem; the consequence of the effect in an instructional setting is yet another problem. Despite this confounding of the transmission and the coding function, it is still useful to restrict the use of channel to describe the former, while symbol system would describe the coding function. In an earlier effort in structural analysis (Pryluck &amp; Snow, 1967), channel or information channel was used to des- cribe what now can be called a coding subsystem. With this new</page><page sequence="12">MOTION PICTURES AS A SYMBOL SYSTEM : 383 CODING UNITS: SOME DEFINITIONS terminology, speech, for instance, is a symbol system consisting of two coding subsystems, one digital-the audio verbal- and the other analogic-the audio paraverbal. Coding, as a selective process, consists of a series of coding de- cisions; the manifestations of these decisions are coding units, units of meaning which encompass content and expression. The relationship of these three terms are schematically represented in Figure 2. FIGURE 2 Schematic Relationship between Meaning, Content, Expression meaning content expression coding unit The environment which the coding process selectively struc- tures can be seen as an aggregate of attributes (including concep- tual objects and attributes, e. g., God, liberty). The hypothetical complete and unconstrained aggregate of attributes of an envir- oment can be spoken of as the content of that environment. In a communication, selected sets of attributes, and assertions about them, are represented by expression, i. e., the code, the arrange- ments of symbol system elements (adapted from Gleason, 1961). The specific shape of the expression summarizes not only the set of attributes referred to, but also the communicator's assertions about them. As viewed here, the coding elements of the symbol system (expression) and the attributes in the environment (con- tent) are related in determinate ways and are represented by the coding unit. When so represented, the collection of attributes and assertions may be referred to as the semantic content of a com- munication, while the phrase manifest content can be used when referring specifically to the attributes or the environment which these attributes comprise. Meaning will be viewed as the hypothetical complete and unconstrained distribution of associations to the content and ex- pressive elements of a coding unit. This definition is intended as an approach to an operational definition following the word as-</page><page sequence="13">AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW : 384 PRIMARY CODING sociation paradigms; no other implication is intended (adapted from Deese, 1965). All associations are deemed to be of theoreti- cal relevance. The development of adequate techniques for des- cribing nonverbal associations is, however, a research task that remains to be accomplished. Linguistic analysis, by use of such terms as morphemic and syn- tactic, distinguishes levels of coding decision that enter into the manipulation of a symbol system. Direct borrowing of similar terms would imply a rigor which is not yet present in the analysis of filmic communication; it seems advisable to use more general terms, primary coding and secondary coding. The parallel im- plied between "word" and "shot" as primary coding units is only approximate; words are composed of discriminable coding vari- ables-phones, stress, pitch, junctures-which combine to form coding units; shots are composed of discriminable coding vari- ables which combine to form coding units." In the most general case, the shot is a mechanically processed set of pictures presented in series of indeterminate length; as a pictorial representation the semantic content of a shot is direct and specific: it is a picture of something. The word, by contrast, has generalized semantic content and an arbitrary length. From these contrasting characteristics arise a number of divergences in the way in which each may be utilized and analyzed. The word chair subsumes a limited number of criterial attri- butes; a chair spoken about is a generalized four-legged seat with a back. The chair photographed is a specific chair with a larger number of attributes. It is an old rickety wooden kitchen chair, it is a plush easy chair, it is perhaps a carefully repaired not-so- rickety wooden kitchen chair. More, the specific chair is photo- graphed from a specific angle, with specific lighting, occupies a certain space in the photographic frame, etc. Denotation and con- notation, manifest content and semantic content, are all but in- extricably intermixed in the single representation of the photo- graphed chair. One way to view this characteristic is as the reductio ad absur- dum of the numerous detailed significations for certain items in various cultures: parrots in Brazilian, camels in Arabic, snow in SThe existence of something like filmic coding variables was evident to most writers on film who referred to them in different ways; e.g., form language (Belizs, 1953); formative media (Arnheim, 1933); differentiating factors (Spottiswoode, 1935).</page><page sequence="14">MOTION PICTURES AS A SYMBOL SYSTEM : 385 Eskimo. It is in this general sense that it is true that the camera- man creates a new vocabulary each time. This apparent one-to- one relationship between attributes in the environment and their representation on film seems to have led many writers to describe filmic communication in terms more appropriate to channels than to symbol systems (e. g., Knowlton, 1964; Lumsdaine, 1963). These writers are correct when they suggest the difficulty of dis- cussing visual communication apart from the message; they go awry, I think, when they fail to recognize the difficulty of dis- cussing the content of a visual communication apart from its expression. As a consequence of the direct and specific reference of a pic- torial representation, the expressive and content aspects of a filmic communication are inherently interrelated. Meaning as defined is drawn from both aspects in a way that is not true of language. With the questionable exception of onomatopoeia, expression in language bears only an arbitrary relationship to content. Only the content signified elicits associations to the sound combina- tions represented by the orthography: pferd, cheval, horse. There is nothing in these sound combinations to suggest a large, solid, hoofed, herbivorous mammal. The expressive representations of pictorial communication are not arbitrary and they do appear to have associations independent of the content. A low key photograph of anything appears to have different meaning from a high key photograph of the same thing.' Whether the associations do in fact differ is an empirical problem. A number of similar coding variables have been cited in the aesthetic literature as having filmic communication conse- quences quite apart from the content: angle of view; size of im- age; placement of image in the frame; relation of images within the frame; lighting (angle, key, etc.); movement within the frame and camera movement; perspective. It seems to be the case that content cannot be represented with- out an implication of expressive meaning; it also seems to be the case, in motion pictures at any rate, that there can be no expres- sion without an implication of content. Even geometric shapes when animated were uniformly perceived by subjects to have "Key in photography refers to the range of tones in the photograph; a low key refers to "pictures in which the majority of tones lie toward the darker end of the scale" while in high key "the emphasis is distinctly on the lighter tones" (Journal of the University Film Producers Association, 1960, pp. 20, 27).</page><page sequence="15">AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW : 386 anthropomorphic content (Heider &amp; Simmel, 1944). This appar- ently inextricable relationship of expression and content in filmic communication points to a hazard in attempting to utilize lin- guistic paradigms for filmic analysis. The meaning of the content of a shot appears to inhere, at least in part, in its expression; the phonemic ranges of expression in a shot appears to inhere, at least in part, in its content. Whether a particular angle, for in- stance, is semantically different from other angles could depend in part on the subject being photographed. The general statement that the photographic angle has coding relevance can be made; but the phonemic range of angles must, it seems, be stated in the con- text of the content of the shot. While the linguist can make state- ments of phonemic significance solely conditional upon struc- tural relationships within the symbol system, the filmic analyst must, it would appear, make statements which are conditional not only on structural relationships, but also conditional upon expressive-content relationships. The little empirical work that has been done on the effect of the primary coding variables in filmic communication lend support to this position. The results of these studies suggest that the aes- thetic intuitions were correct in general, as they often are, but that the particulars are more complicated than would be apparent from either aesthetic literature or a simple translation of linguistic paradigms (see Shoemaker, 1964; Tannenbaum &amp; Fosdick, 1960). The indeterminate length of the shot is another source of di- vergence between linquistic and filmic analysis. Worth (1965) attempted to deal with this problem by distinguishing between the shot as it comes from the camera, the cademe, and the shot as it is used in the edited version, the edeme. This is a useful dis- tinction but even thus defined the shot is problematic as a basic unit. The length of an edeme can vary greatly with consequent variation in the amount of information transmitted. Edemes can range from fractions of a second showing a static close-up to sev- eral minutes of intricate camera movement showing complex movement within the frame. One way of viewing the edeme would be as a rough analog to the linguistic utterance. The concept of the utterance in linguis- tics enables analysis "to start with some unit of talk that could be marked off with no uncertainty" (Fries, 1952, p. 23). Similar- ly, the shot is a unit that can be marked off with no uncertainty;</page><page sequence="16">MOTION PICTURES AS A SYMBOL SYSTEM : 387 SECONDARY CODING the shot, by definition, extends from one splice to the next. The concept of the utterance applied to filmic analysis could thus en- compass shots of differing lengths and complexity yet still keep open the question of potential sub-units: space-bound coding variables such as the angle, and time-bound coding variables such as changes within a shot. However, the use of utterance in this context must be qualified; to obviate any confusion, it is probably useful to use the term filmic utterance where necessary. In linguistic analysis the utter- ance approximates a sentence or a number of sentences, where the sentence is a group of words joined together by grammatical agreements and not grammatically dependent upon any other group. The shot, by contrast, is a single unit potentially encom- passing the content of a linguistic utterance; the shot is more than a word, yet by its unity less than a sentence.8 As with the comparison of words and shots, any comparison of the edited picture with the sentence is only approximate. Once the cademe has been encoded, i.e., mechanically processed using the coding variables available, it becomes the raw material for the construction of the filmic communication proper, just as words are the raw material for secondary coding in language. "The foundation of film art is editing [p. 23]." This proposi- tion by Pudovkin (1933), one of the Russian filmmaker theorists of the late silent film period has since been echoed and accepted as the fundamental assumption of film aesthetics. Scientific at- tempts to deal with filmic communication have not reflected the importance generally attributed to editing. Secondary coding is important in any symbol system since combining of primary units in some kind of arrangement extends the coding potential to almost infinite range. These extensions appear to have different consequences in languages and film. Structurally, the abstraction of a word tends to be specified by syntax and the specificity of a shot tends to be generalized by juxtaposition in editing.' The functional consequence of this elaboration seems to differ among symbol systems; sequencing in language appears to facilitate SThis comparison is valid for the languages familiar to most readers. There are some languages which have characteristics similar to those of a shot; the "words" in these polysynthetic languages are in effect "sentences" although they consist of a single unit. The structure of these "word- sentences" is generally derived by morphemic analysis (Hughes, 1962). 'I am indebted to Edward P. McCoy of Michigan State University for clarifying this point.</page><page sequence="17">AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW : 388 subtle distinctions in conceptualization while in filmic commun- ication sequencing appears to facilitate conceptualization derived from the experiential nature of shots. In this sense film would seem to be structurally inductive, while language would appear to be structurally deductive. These differences appear to stem from the structural character- istics of sequencing. Whereas linguistic coding units "do not just get strung out one after the other in any order whatsoever," "any two pieces of a film stuck together inevitably combine to create a new concept, a new quality born of that juxtaposition" (Carroll, 1963, p. 19; Eisenstein, 1939, p. 63). It is difficult to know whether these contrasting orientations toward sequencing in the two symbol systems are due to funda- mental differences between them or are only apparent differences because of greater sophistication of syntactic analysis. In any event, it has been demonstrated that in language: I. Certain classes of words must occupy certain specifiable positions when signalling certain types of content, e.g., the de- clarative sentence John is going contrasts with the interrogative Is John going only by the position of a single word. Of the four other logical arrangements of these three words, only one, Going is John has any grammatical standing and then only in quasi- poetic use. Immediately recognized as being ungrammatical and perhaps contentless are the other three combinations: Going John is, Is going John, John going is. 2. There are structure words whose definition (i.e., content) can be stated only with difficulty, and then not very satisfactori- ly. The function of these words is to relate content of other words in the context of a sentence. Although there may be disagreement in detail they are generally believed to have no inherent content; these words include such copulas as: is, the, a, of, that, which. 3. Suprasegmental phonemes serve to establish semantic boundaries between consecutive sequences and within sequences. There is only a suprasegmental difference (signalled by punctu- ation) between Radio Commentators, who are often criticized, help mold opinion and Radio commentators who are often criti- cized help mold opinion. There is no punctuation to distinguish between girl hunters, i.e., females who hunt, and girl hunters, i.e., those who hunt girls. The linguistic characteristics of fixed word order, copulas, and suprasegmental phonemes seem to function as signalling devices</page><page sequence="18">MOTION PICTURES AS A SYMBOL SYSTEM : 389 for specifying relationships. The determinate sequencing of word forms can be seen as specifying semantic relationships quite apart from their content. Almost any speaker of the language under- stands in general who did what to whom and where when told something like 'Twas brillig and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe. Even when filled with nonsense syllables the structure of a sentence specifies certain relationships. The inde- terminate order of shots within a filmic sequence, though, leaves open the nature of the relationships between shots. Specifying relationships is the whole function of the copulas; they represent concepts of relationship and thus there are no ob- vious ways of independently expressing them by pictorial repre- sentation. A copula-like expression may be sometimes possible as part of the content of a shot; this is problematic. The necessity of suprasegmental marking of semantic bounda- ries in language is illustrated by syntactic ambiguity as in They are cooking apples or the Sunday school pun, Gladly the cross- eyed bear. Possibly greater significance is indicated by discus- sions of the evidence relating to the written equivalent of the su- prasegmental phonemes; it has been suggested "that the period and other grammatical features act as a kind of psychological barrier, which reduces the likelihood that temporally contiguous terms, on opposite sides of this barrier, become associated with each other" (Rothkopf, 1965; pp. 196-197; see also Osgood et al., 1957, pp. 200ff). None of these characteristics is present in quite the same way in filmic communication. There is no known limitation on the placement within a sequence of any particular class of shot. There is no way similar to copulas to signal the nature of the relation- ship between shots; there is no filmic equivalent to is, of, the, a, that, which, etc. There is no direct equivalent to the suprasegmen- tal phoneme in filmic communication. The direct reference characteristic of pictorial representation seems to preclude syntactic ambiguity; when necessary, marking of semantic boundaries in film is accomplished by matching or contrasting coding variables or content of the shot. More general application of these editing relationships will be discussed below. Some attempt has been made to put the copulative and supra- segmental burden on the flimsy devices of optical effects: fades, dissolves, wipes, etc. Whatever else these devices accomplish (and this is unclear) it is clear that they are not the equivalent of punc-</page><page sequence="19">AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW : 390 tuation or any other grammatical characteristic. Their failure in this regard has been empirically demonstrated (Mercer, 1952). Contrasting with linguistic practice to an even greater degree, there are no clearly established rules, traditions, or conventions governing the placement of shots within a sequence; any number of shots could be sequenced in any fashion to the limit of logical possibilities. However, relationships in film are not completely indeterminate. Rather than being either determinate or indeter- minate, filmic sequencing rules appear to be probability rules where all sequences have a P&gt;o; as such, they share certain qual- ities with bookmakers' odds-they may shift tomorrow depend- ing on the circumstances. At this moment, however, it seems that the filmic equivalent to any one of the logical arrangements of the three words, going, John, is, might be an acceptable sequencing decision in given circumstances although the sequence equivalent to something like John going is might have a probability of perhaps P=.oi, while the equivalent to John is going might have a probability of perhaps P= .50. In short, there appears to be a difference in logical structure between language and film which is reflected in the sequencing of primary coding units. One central difference in the two symbol systems would appear to be in the specification of content rela- tionships between primary units. Numerous subtle relationships can be fixed and specified through the manipulation of just the linguistic characteristics so far discussed; the possibility of num- berless explicit statements of relationship is, I suggest, one factor that makes language the profound instrument it is. The general absence of devices to signal relationships between shots has important consequences for the nature of filmic com- munication. In film the relationship between succeeding shots is direct and imperative based on the immediacy of the juxtaposi- tion between shots. When two pieces of film are stuck together (to use Eisenstein's phrase) they are separated only by a substan- tially invisible marker, the splice. There is direct and immediate contact between juxtaposed shots. No intervention of any sort occurs between the content of a sequence edited for maximal jux- tapositional contact. Juxtaposition, it is widely believed, lies at the heart of filmic communication. Succeeding shots are seen as qualifying each other; each juxtaposition is assumed to facilitate associations not obviously present in either element in the pair. From the definition of meaning as a hypothetical distribution</page><page sequence="20">MOTION PICTURES AS A SYMBOL SYSTEM : 391 Inferential Relationships of associations it can be assumed that each shot has extensive associations with varying likelihoods of appearance. The juxta- position effect would appear to depend on relationships between overlapping associations between shots. While the nature of these relationships is not directly at issue here, it is recognized that no detailed description of the process at the effects side of the communication model is possible without making some commit- ment as to the mechanisms underlying these relationships. Whichever of the explanatory concepts one adopts it must be as- sumed that there is no exact match between the distribution of associations of the juxtaposed shots; the overlap could be between any of the associations in the distribution and thus need not be obviously present in either element in the juxtapositional pair. As a theoretical proposition the concept of overlapping associ- ations does not necessarily imply that the associations are com- mon to both shots. It may be that the associations are overlapping in the sense of being jointly related to yet another association. While juxtapositional relationships are assumed in other symbol systems, they take on greater importance in filmic communica- tion due to the structural constraint that the viewer of a film can- not be told what are the relationships between shots. The viewer can of course be told through the narration; but that is a different problem which we will come to. The experiences depicted and their juxtaposition may be direct and specific, but the conceptual relationships between shots are indirect and inferential. When a shot of a young man is followed by a shot of an old man these are very specific and direct significations; their relationship, how- ever, must be inferred. These inferences are not often happen- stance. If inferences are elicited, they are the result of coding decisions directed toward establishing inferential relationships through the sequencing of consecutive shots. Inferential relation- ships are not quite the same as implications. The manipulators of a code are not necessarily aware of the implications of their oper- ations; inferential relationships, however, are actively sought in filmic coding. In this sense then it is possible to have implications in filmic communication that transcend the inferential relation- ships actively included. The existence of inferential relationships is the underlying assumption of film editing and perhaps of all filmic communica- tion although the mechanism governing filmic juxtapositions is only dimly and intuitively understood. The juxtaposition of a</page><page sequence="21">AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW : 392 shot of a man and a shot of a child playing do not simply show us what a man looks like compared to a child (although this is often the way sequences are conceived in pedestrian films). There are relationships that can be manipulated. One of the relevant varia- bles in this context is the length of time each of the shots is per- mitted to remain on the screen. Or the order of the shots can be interchanged. Whatever the manipulations, different associations are hypothesized. To elaborate on this example a bit, let us include a shot of a bowl of soup and a shot of a woman in a coffin. If we pair the man's face with each of the other shots in separate trials, the as- sumption is that the man's face will be perceived as being happy, pensive, or sorrowful depending on which shot it was paired with (Pudovkin, 1933, pp. 166-171). This classic example of juxtapo- sitional effect is based on semantics; the same point could be made for syntax by photographing a two-player scene from four different angles or with four different image sizes, e.g., long shot, two-shot, close-up of each player. If each shot is used once in a sequence the assumption of film editing is that different associa- tions result from the permutations of these four shots, or in general that each of the permutations of any set of shots can stim- ulate different associations. Whether there would actually be four factorial different relationships is an empirical problem; it seems likely that the 24 variations would in fact cluster in some fashion. It further seems likely that an example based on semantics would yield a greater number of distinct relationships than would an example based purely on syntax. An approximation to the juxta- position assumption has been tested in verbal concept forma- tion using sets of ambiguously related words (Judson &amp; Cofer, 1956); Gregory (1961) made a somewhat more complex test of the general proposition. The assumptions of juxtaposition effect and consequent infe- rential relationships are among the major factors limiting inde- terminate sequencing in film editing. Eisenstein's observation notwithstanding it appears to be stretching matters somewhat to expect a determinate inference as a result of juxtaposing shots of the following items (casually chosen from a dictionary): mizzen-mast, sulfate process, canary.10 Logical or literary rela- tionships, however, are not enough; it is generally believed " i.e., the aftermost mast in a two-or three-masted vessel, a process for making wood pulp, and a small bird.</page><page sequence="22">MOTION PICTURES AS A SYMBOL SYSTEM : 393 that for effective juxtaposition succeeding shots should have both expressive and content relevance. Perhaps more important than ordinary content relationships is some kind of expressive (i.e., visual) relationship between juxtaposed shots. To take a simple example, it is possible to jux- tapose shots of a man and a barnyard animal, say a pig. The literary allusion is clear, but aesthetic theory would argue that the plain literary relationship is inadequate; there is an additional necessity of relating the shots in some visual fashion. The logic of this position is that film can strengthen some allusions by simultaneously encompassing related attributes that language cannot; the specificity of pictures in other cases can obscure the literary allusion by specifying what should perhaps be abstract. If the shots were of man and animal chewing and approxi- mately the same image size (e.g., both close-ups) the literary allusion could presumably be buttressed by the up-and-down movement of the jaws. To complicate the example a bit further, take just any shots of a man and a pig and juxtapose them with yet another shot of a machine of some sort. There are perhaps some kinds of associations relating these three shots; but suppose instead that the set of visually related shots was used in conjunc- tion with a shot of a machine with a similar up-and-down move- ment. It is suggested by this line of reasoning that a more determinate response would be evoked by the visual comparison of the masticating movement in the latter set of shots: man, ani- mal, machine. Suppose further that the man is not just any man but a specific type, a policeman, a soldier, an academic; there would be evoked by this latest set of shots yet other associations different from the first two. Visual content and image size comparisons or contrasts are not the only devices for inferential relationships. As in the special case of these relationships, semantic boundaries, any of the cod- ing variables can be used, e.g., similar or contrasting lighting may be juxtaposed or, similarity or contrast can be signified be- tween succeeding shots by actions or settings within the shots. Across any given splice there are numerous juxtapositional pos- sibilities arising from the several coding variables, degrees of contrast, types of content, etc. The only established limits on these combinations have been pragmatically derived aesthetic considerations; in the language of the trade, a sequence is accept- able if it works, i.e., seems to communicate with an audience. As</page><page sequence="23">AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW : 394 GENERAL SYMBOL SYSTEM Sound/Picture Interaction these considerations change, there is a consequent change in the probability statement covering particular types of sequencing. It had for a long time been believed that juxtaposed shots should vary along at least one of the coding variable dimensions to avoid jump cuts, i.e., changes in scene with only slight changes in coding variable (see Reisz, 1953, ch. 14). Contemporary film editing techniques, popularized by Godard in A Bout de Souffle (Breathless) (1959), have demonstrated that the injunction against jump cuts was not the imperative formerly believed. When such cuts are believed to make a point they have been wide- ly accepted in recent years. It is worth noting, however, that Eisenstein used something very close to jump cuts in the Odessa steps sequence in Battleship Potemkin (1925), notably in the juxtaposition of two substantially similar shots; a woman wear- ing pince-nez glasses, and the same woman with her glasses shattered (Eisenstein, 1929, pp. 55-56; plate 7, between pp. 52- 53). These matters become thoroughly confounded with the inclusion of sound accompaniment. Thus far our discussion of filmic com- munication has centered on the structural characteristics of pic- tures on the commonsense basis that without them there can be no filmic communication. However, it is a sometimes-forgotten historical fact that motion pictures have almost never been dis- played without some kind of sound and verbal accompaniment. So intermixed have these components been that out-of-tune pianos tinkling something like "William Tell Overture" and subtitle cards like "Meanwhile back at the ranch" have become cliches even for those whose first movie-going experience was a Rock Hudson film. Crude sound effects were also part of the dis- play; it was a poor theater that didn't possess a siren, a klaxon, a set of bells, etc. The significant innovation of sound films was not the inclusion of sound and verbal interpretation but their inclusion in precise and determinate fashion. Before going further it is important to understand something of the mechanics of film production; in the most general case of filmic communication, motion pictures, the components are norm- ally manipulated independently in four separate tracks;1 a picture (or action) track, a speech (or narration, or dialogue) track, a music track, and a sound effects track. These are the phrases used n There are special cases (lectures, panels, news reporting, etc.) where this is not always true.</page><page sequence="24">MOTION PICTURES AS A SYMBOL SYSTEM : 395 in the trade to describe them and they have a literal independent existence in the formative stages of filmmaking. Only at the end of the process are these independent components transferred into a channel form; the separate tracks are incorporated into a com- posite print which is the print customarily projected for public viewing. As a practical matter, the separate tracks are not always edited simultaneously, but, even when a single track is on the editor's bench, its relationships to the other tracks are considered. At every stage of the formative process, these separate tracks are coded with continual reference to both the horizontal and vertical relationships schematically depicted in Figure 3. The FIGURE 3 Schematic Illustration of Sound-Music- Word-Picture Interaction SOUND MUSIC WORD PICTURE serial juxtaposition t lateral juxtaposition picture editing problem and the sound-music-word-picture prob- lem are both contextual problems dealing with the interaction of effects in a context. It may be convenient to distinguish these relationships, referring to serial juxtapositions, relationships within a track, and lateral juxtapositions, relationships between tracks. Understanding of the effects of individual components is only a start, a baseline. The fundamental problem of filmic communi- cation is the interaction of these individual effects, serially and laterally. The simplest case of lateral juxtaposition is the precod- ed experience capable of being independently transmitted as other than filmic communication, e.g., filmed or televised lecture, dem- onstration, or panel. While this type of precoded experience is subject to minimum cross-track manipulation, there is, nonethe- less, a lateral juxtaposition between the sound and the picture; the picture, at any rate, is subject to the specific constraints of primary and secondary coding. These constraints on the picture, it is suggested, might affect the meaning of the precoded experi-</page><page sequence="25">AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW : 396 Independent Meaning ence and the whole unit (picture and sound) is subject to the general constraints of transmission which may further affect the meaning. The emphasis in the original coding may not be congruent with the emphasis that is assumed to result from changing image size or changing angle; the pacing of the editing may differ from the pacing of the precoded experience; a general "dullness" may be introduced if an attempt is made to avoid varying image size or angle. Even in the event that the pacing and emphasis appear to be congruent between the experience and the filmic coding there is reason to suggest that this apparent redundancy may result in under- or overemphasis (see, e.g., Rose, 1964). There are also theoretical considerations regarding the appar- ent redundancy between word and picture. It can be argued that some words signify certain selected attributes while the related picture signifies a larger number of attributes. In this case the distribution of associations may be more extensive for the picture than for the word. The converse also appears to be true; some words signify greater content than do the pictures relating to these words. Strictly speaking, in neither case would the meaning of word and picture be redundant. There are a number of lateral relationships; using the terminology defined earlier, there are manipulations possible as a result of discrepancies between sound and picture in terms of content, intended meaning, and semantic content.12 The intimate interrelationship of word, music, sound, and picture has generated a fair amount of controversy; here as with picture editing, the interest of science has not reflected the intensity of aesthetic concern. The issues in this area are even more problema- tic than those discussed thus far. There is general agreement in the aesthetic literature about the nature of what we are calling primary and secondary coding, even if there is little firm evidence supporting this agreement. No such agreement exists regarding the general relationship between sound and picture. The domi- nant position in film literature argues that words are entirely subsidiary to the visual and that if words are used it is necessary to "reduce the weight and volume of the spoken word" (Kracauer, 1960, p. 0o6). "Sound film demands a style of weightless words" (Belizs, 1953, P. 229). 1"The typology presented by Kracauer (1960) appears to be the most generally applicable in the analysis of lateral relationships (pp. Eiiff).</page><page sequence="26">MOTION PICTURES AS A SYMBOL SYSTEM : 397 Other writers criticize the run-of-the-projection-room film on precisely the grounds that its words are trivial. The proponents of this position argue that contrary to the commonly accepted view, film can effectively use a more poetic diction. "The screen does not necessarily dim or grow boring because someone speaks a brilliant succession of words" (Alpert, 1962 p. 242). "I feel intensely that poetry, verbal poetry, is an essential aspect of cinematic expression" (Lawson, 1964, p. 196). The anti-word position is often generalized as a principle that we will call independent meaning. The aesthetic idea of independ- ent meaning is that all sounds in film-words, natural sounds, music-must not possess meanings "which assert themselves independently of the flow of visuals" (Kracauer, 1960, p. 220). Kracauer refers to this principle under the heading of detachable patterns of meaning; Panofsky's (1959) phrase for it is principle of coexpressibility: "In a film, that which we hear remains, for good or worse, inextricably fused with that which we see; the sound, articulate or not, cannot express any more than is express- ed, at the same time, by visual movement [p. 21]." Belazs (1953) expresses similar ideas as the law of impermeability. As stated, this principle doesn't move the argument forward very far, since proponents of the poetic diction position suggest that they agree in principle, differing in detail (see, e.g., Lawson, 1964). One way of viewing a coding unit with independent meaning is as a form of fully precoded experience; we have already dis- cussed the simplest lateral juxtaposition for such a unit. However, if the juxtaposition assumption makes any sense at all, we must presume that something else may happen when coding units with independent meaning are juxtaposed in some of the more complex lateral relationships. ,From the critical definitions it can be seen that independent meaning is generally believed to be a characteristic of speech or music. Pictures may or may not have independent meaning, but they are the stuff of movies; thus, their independence is relatively less crucial. Most writers agree that the interpenetration of sound and picture is the theoretical ideal; short of the ideal, the injunc- tion against sound with independent meaning is urged. The general line of argument suggests that the meaning of sound and picture are diluted when coding units with independent meaning are utilized.</page><page sequence="27">AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW : 398 A favorite example in this argument is Shakespearean drama. It is suggested that the richness of Shakespeare's language is distorted when accompanied by an equally opulent picture (Be- lzs, 1953; Kracauer, 1960). The argument turns strictly evalua- tive with regard to the alternative simplification of the visuals. The viewer is only distracted, argues one side, by being able to see the warts on Romeo's nose; the rebuttal is that "interpreta- tions can be made more incisive through the use of the close-up" (Alpert, 1962, pp. 242-243). The problems surrounding independent meaning are not al- ways this clear-cut. Independent meaning of a verbal coding unit may be intricate and sophisticated. Juxtaposing such a cod- ing unit with a pictorial coding unit could oversimplify the meaning of the words by illustrative specification of a complex set of meanings. The converse also exists as a possibility; subtle and ineffable picture track may be oversimplified by sound with independent meaning. Both of these possibilities stem in part from the structural limitation of film noted earlier; there are no ways in film to indicate such comparative relationships as is, is like, is something like. It would seem that while weightless coding units may be qualified by other units in a symbiotic fashion, some units are sufficiently independent that qualification begins to distort meaning rather than rendering it more precise. Distort is not used in any pejorative sense. The distinction between distortion and precision is intended to highlight two different types of coding consequence. Using a pencil as a metaphor, an increase in preci- sion is seen as sharpening the point, while distortion is seen as dulling or breaking (i.e., changing) the point. Evaluative judg- ment of these consequences is not our concern here. In short, coding units with independent meaning do not easily enter juxtapositional relationships. This seems particularly strik- ing in cases where a clash of associations is based on the abstract character of the individual words in the secondary coding unit. It is not clear that analogic information could add anything to take arms against a sea of trouble ... bear the whips and scorns of time although lines with independent meaning can under certain circumstances be usefully placed in juxtaposition with other coding units. Even in these cases, however, there appears to be a distortion of meaning, if only the distortion represented by irony.</page><page sequence="28">MOTION PICTURES AS A SYMBOL SYSTEM : 399 Coding units with independent meaning are sometimes uti- lized precisely because their independent meaning enables asser- tions to be made through conflicts between associations to the picture and the independent meaning of the sound. Music is often used in this way. The Stars and Stripes Forever march may be played in juxtaposition with pictures of a bedraggled Boy Scout troop returning from a series of misadventures. In the National Film Board of Canada film Caroline (Perron, 1964) Christopher Marlowe's lines Come live with me and be my love and we will all the treasures prove ... are juxtaposed with a plain close-up of a young working mother on her lunch hour. It was suggested earlier that pictures are structurally inductive while words are structurally deductive. This idea can be elabora- ted to suggest that analogic information is inherently inductive while digital information can be utilized inductively or deduc- tively. From the examples given in the aesthetic literature it can be suggested that weightless words are inductive, specific instances of an experience rather than generalized statements of that expe- rience. The critical mandate for weightless words to juxtapose with picture and natural sound may reflect an intuitively per- ceived need for some kind of logical consistency. Still at issue, however, is whether there is a psychological requirement for consistency between simultaneous inductive and deductive pre- sentations of analogic and digital information. Although the argument has been usually couched in aesthetic- artistic terms, the issue of independent meaning is central to any discussion of filmic communication: picture and sound seem to qualify each other at least as much as do succeeding words, suc- ceeding pictures, or succeeding sounds. When the sounds are words or music whose meaning (i.e., distribution of associations) is not dependent on lateral juxtapositions, the independent mean- ing can distort the meaning of the picture or be distorted by the picture. In short, it cannot be assumed that words or music or pictures when juxtaposed retain their intended meanings. Thus, even if one wished to ignore the relationship between tracks, the rela- tionship exists; in any filmic coding a decision is made (explicitly or otherwise) on the relative utilization of each of the tracks. Placed another way, the existence of multiple tracks is a structural characteristic of the coding operation, similar to the structural characteristics of coding variables in primary coding or coding</page><page sequence="29">AV COMMUNICATION REVIEW : 400 units in secondary coding. It is assumed in the aesthetic litera- ture concerned with film and is suggested here for more general application that these structural characteristics in some determi- nate fashion constrain or facilitate the communication of an in- tended message whether the message is entertaining, persuasive, or instructional.
