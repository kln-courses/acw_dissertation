None of this is dichotomous or indeed parallel in construction. In fact, Welch argues against dichotomous keys on p. 62. In addition, there are "guides" for Abies, Cupressus, and Juniperus (resp., pp. 98-100, 290-291, 324-325), actually tables for the first two, and finally even a dichotomous key for Chamaecyparis (p. 196). On the downside are use of angiosperm terminology ("flowers," "fruits," etc.), anthropomorphic and teleological expressions (among the worst, species that "laughed," a plant that "wakes up slowly" in the spring, p. 32), various slips (e.g., "Johnson" for "Johnston," p. 317), fuzzy language (Diselma in mountains of "Australia and W. Tasmania," p. 317), and erroneous ranges (Fitzroya cupressoides "only in southern Chile," p. 317, a mistake also in Krussmann, p. 119). I examined the manuals by Welch, Rushforth, Kriissmann, and three others, including W. Dallimore &amp; A. B. Jackson's A hand- book of Coniferae and Ginkgoaceae (1966, 4th ed. rev. by S. G. Harrison) to seek morphological and horticultural information (but not especially information on cultivars) on Ginkgo and 12 species of conifers. All show similar slips and fuzziness. Indeed the disagreement and misinformation perpet- uated from one book to the next is rather disconcerting. Welch's work naturally is vital for an up- dating of nomenclatural and taxonomic aspects of the many infraspecific taxa he treats. Unfortu- nately, the high cost of the book, ca. $137.75 for the first of two volumes, will restrict its acquisition to botanical libraries. Individuals needing a "conifer manual" will get much better value for their money spending $65.00 on Kriissmann or $27.95 on Rushforth. [Rudolf Schmid, UC] Woodland, Dennis W.

He appears to have succeeded, though the proof will be in the pudding sales. The book covers the requisite topics, including a useful chapter with con- tributions by four outsiders (see Contents) that distills Stuessy's new Davis &amp; Heywood (for review see R. Schmid, Taxon 40: 361-362), and 245 handy, compact summaries for vascular plant families. The 210 family synopses for the angiosperms are ringed with a border and involve one page per fam- ily except for grasses and comps, which slop onto two pages (legumes are split into three families). Students will be intrigued by the many photos of botanists and botanical institutions and by the fig- ures of newspaper clippings on plant rustling (p. 468), the letter to John Thomas by a student who is endangering plants (p. 473), and the phylogeny of paper clips (p. 399).

If there is only one book to get, naturally it will have to be Bryan's because of its worldwide coverage, greater detail, and more attention to horticultural aspects. However, the two South Africa books are most imposing, in particular that by du Plessis &amp; Duncan, in part because of its striking jacket drawing of four species of Scadoxus and its slip case (which quickly becomes a deterrent to use). The listing of the Contents above offers comparisons between these three large-format works, but the following points seem worthy of mention. The two South African books treat fewer taxa and favor segregate families, especially of Amaryllidaceae and Liliaceae. Bryan discusses many more taxa, including some not ordinarily associated with bulbous plants, for instance, two pages on Canna. The two South African books have only diagrams and the excellent full-page watercolor plates: du Plessis &amp; Duncan with 47 magnificent plates by Elise Bodley on 16 families, 84 genera, Jeppe with her 62 fine plates on 8 families, 52 genera. My stylistic preference is for Bodley's plates. While the 300 excellent color plates in Bryan (164 in vol. 1, 136 in vol. 2) involve mostly photos (over 750), 110 plates are of drawings from various publications, including 43 plates from Curtis's botanical maga- zine. The introductory matter in du Plessis &amp; Duncan seems more useful than that in Jeppe; that in Bryan is the most extensive. All works have endpaper maps. The most attractive endpapers are those in du Plessis &amp; Duncan, the most information those in Bryan. His endpaper map has 75 loca- tions numbered and keyed to the list of "bulbs around the world" representing the first three pages of preliminaries (might this useful information not have been more attractively and handily placed on the back endpaper?). All three works are very worthwhile additions to the literature and credits to their authors, illus- trators, and publishers.
