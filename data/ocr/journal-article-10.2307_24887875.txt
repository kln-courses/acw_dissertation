<plain_text><page sequence="1">Among the Priests of Elephantine Island Elephantine Island Seen from Egyptian Sources* Matthias Müller Summary The present paper gives an short overview on the history of Elephantine and Aswan in the extreme south of Egypt. A second part is devoted to some micro historical events as they rep resent themselves in the Demotic texts from the island. Both are intended as an introduction for students and scholars of Theology and Ancient History. Descriptions of Elephantine Island and its history appear often slightly biased depending on the background of the respective authors. Egyptologists tend to draw upon sources written in Egyptian and (in best practise) on the results of archaeological research. Papyrologists naturally prefer the rich Greek sources sparsely adding (one may daresay) references to Demotic texts, whereas schol ars of theology, Judaic or Aramaic studies are often solely based on the rightly famous Aramaic sources. These biased approaches, however, often create the impression that only Egyptians, or a Greek-only speaking (or writing) pop ulation that often sported Egyptian names, or only Jews (or better Judeans1) inhabited the island. Yet, due to its position at the ultimate limits of the re spective realms ruling it, Elephantine was, probably from the foundation of its settlement, a 'melting pot' of various cultures. People with diverse origins lived there,2 even if the examination of the skeletal remains showed a rather * The author would like to express his gratitude to Andreas Dorn/Bonn, Jennifer Cromwell/ Copenhagen, Jan Moje/Berlin, Joachim Friedrich Quack/Heidelberg, Cornelius von Pil grim/Cairo, and Günter Vittman/Würzburg, who supplied stimulating insights on various forms of earlier drafts of this paper.

Although the present name of the island is Gazirat Aswan "island of Aswan," it is better known under the Greek (or rather Greek translation of the Egyptian) name Elephantine. Situated in the extreme south of Egypt (about 890 km south of Cairo) opposite the town of Aswan and north of the rapids known as the 1st cataract, which make a riverine traffic towards and from the south impossible, Elephantine is located at the crossing of various trade routes and ways between South and North. The island measures 1,6 km in length and 450 m in width and covers an area of about 46 ha. Earliest settlement traces date to the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC.4 In the middle of the 3rd millennium BC, the Aswân-area5 develops into the point of departure for Egyptian long-distance trade with Africa.6 With the ris ing importance of trade, the local elites prospered, as the rock tombs for the male upper class of the society located upon the western bank at the Qubbet el-Hawa exemplify.7 Upon the island itself, administrative8 as well as sacral 14 = Ursula Kaplony-Heckel, Land und Leute am Nil nach demotischen Inschriften, Papyri und Ostraka, Gesammelte Schriften II, ÄA 71/2, Wiesbaden 2009, 1038-1051: 1042 note 14. 3 Friedrich W.

In those days, Elephantine consisted of two islands, which could be reached by foot only in the event of low water. Whereas the actual town was located at the eastern island, with an estimated population of about 1400 persons11, the western island served as a/its cemetery. In addition, the latter island housed a small step-pyramid, as well as a palace (called "Königspfalz" by the excava tors). The depression between the two islands seems to have been filled during the 3rd millennium BC. A generally lower Nile12 - resulting from a deteriora tion of the sub-pluvial climate, which determined the 4th millennium BC, and possible changes in the distribution of precipitation - probably supported this undertaking. Elephantine was not the capital of the 1st Nome of Upper Egypt during the Old Kingdom, but probably an extraterritorial stronghold.13 In addition to the fortification at the islands eastern shore, which had been built already during the 1st dynasty, the abovementioned small step-pyramid might have served as an architectural landmark of the Pharaonic central authority. Yet the pyramids representative function14 was of limited duration, since the area is occupied by workshops (from the 4th dynasty on) as well as the town s ceme tery (from the 5th dynasty onwards). In the later 3rd millennium, the temple of the local goddess Satet was re- and newly built and was extended by a chapel for the cataract deity Khnum. End of the Old Kingdom, in: A.

Now, however, instead of erecting mon umental rock tombs for themselves at the Qubbet el-Hawa, they built chapels for their memorial cult in a local shrine upon the island itself, which is devoted to a venerated and deified private individual by the name of Heqaib.15 The Satet-temple is rebuilt again and extended by an installation to celebrate the feast of the Nile flood, which according to Egyptian belief rises in Elephantine. Additionally, the god Khnum received his own sanctuary in the town centre. Extensive settlement structures are attested on the island.16 In addition to the 'Old town' of the 3rd millennium, a 'New town' was erected in the filled de pression and the former western island.17 As part of the Egyptian expansion to Nubia and the resulting submission of these territories under the dominion of the Pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom, Elephantine's status changed from that of a frontier town to that of an over-regional trade centre. In the reign of Pharaoh Senusret III, the town s fortifications were extended and, as a result of the loss of the dominion over Nubia in the subsequent centuries, Elephan tine turned into a border fortress again. The town might have been sacked by Nubians during that period.18 During Egypt's New Kingdom, in the second half of the 2nd millennium, Lower Nubia was again seized by the Egyptians and consequently the region of Elephantine was again no longer the southernmost point of Egypt. De spite other claims, it seems that the New Kingdom town saw no extension to the north.19 The temples of Khnum and Satet saw various phases of re building and extensions leading to the fact that the temples and their eco nomic areas (grain storage facilities, etc.) now covered about 1/3 of the area. 15 Labib Habachi^, Elephantine IV: The Sanctuary ofHeqaib, 2 vols, AV 33, Mainz 1985; Detlef Franke, Das Heiligtum des Heqaib auf Elephantine.

The island seems to have evaded the Amarna periods iconoclasm successfully.20 Even though the extensive building activities at the local temples (Thutmoside Satet-temple, Khnum-temple21) and the remains of the excavated settlements22 and rock inscriptions (incised on various neighbouring islands and in various places as memorial graffiti by persons participating in the cultic processions for the eternal repetition of their participation in them) document on-going activities on Elephantine island during the period of the New Kingdom,23 the fortuities of preservation have resulted in an almost complete loss of written sources of administrative and other natures. Except for two letters sent from the island24 but of unknown find spot, we only possess a fragmentary papyrus with a list of accusations against local priests at Elephantine from Ramesside times, which comes in all probability from an archive at Thebes.25 In addition, texts from 20 See Martin Bommas, Akhenaten in the 1st Upper Egyptian Nome, in: A.

Documentary texts written in Demotic and Aramaic as well as later Greek and literary (as well as religious-cultic texts) written in Hieratic or Hieroglyphs have been unearthed in great numbers. However, the percentage of published texts is quite unevenly distributed (see below). Not quite unexpectedly, this correlates with the archaeological situation.29 While the Kushite rulers of the 25th dynasty are attested only via inscriptions of ste lae, the Pharaohs of the 26th dynasty erected various extensions within the temple area, such as the Nilometer. In the aftermath of the Persian conquest of Egypt in the year 526 BC30, a Persian garrison31 was stationed at the island, consisting in parts of Jewish/Aramaic soldiers. But even before that, a com munity of Judeans seems to have existed on the island (including a temple). In the year 410 BC, the priest of the Khnum-temple had the Judean temple demol ished, seemingly with the approval of the Persian administrator. The temple was later rebuilt again.32 The last Pharaohs of Egypt, those of the 30th dynasty, commenced another intensive building phase upon the island and in the whole area, which was continued by their successors, the Ptolemies.33 The now much bigger Khnum zweier Tagungen in Mainz im April 2011 und März 2013, AAWLM.G 14, Mainz / Stuttgart 2015,383-433: 398 with flg. 4 on p. 399. 29 See Kaiser et al., MDAIK 46, 213-223; for the 'Aramaic quarter' see in addition to the funda mental paper of Bezalel Porten, The Structure and Orientation of the Jewish Temple at Ele phantine.

The Late Antique town39 covered an area of about 6 ha, upon which about an estimated 3000 inhabitants dwelled. For comparison: the town of Syene measured in imperial times about 20 ha and provided room for an estimated 10000 inhabitants.40 The changes from a pagan to a Christian majority dominated area took place over a longer time period, starting in the 4th century AD and culminating in the 6th century AD. The pagan cults seem to have ceased to exist (at least from our documentation) by the mid-5th century AD.41 Nubian tribes who undertook raids in the area seem to have been a constant threat in those days.

In the early middle ages, i.e., the first centuries after the Arab conquest, the change of power and religion at the realm's government had little effect in the Egyptian periphery. The byzantine administration, i.e., the taxing admin istration, was largely taken over and only gradually was the pressure to convert raised.42 Following military activities against Christian Nubian realms, Arab tribes and families settled in the region of Aswan. Yet, they seem to have pre ferred places outside the historical settlements. Due to its frontier position and to control the trade as well as the mining expeditions to Nubia an Arab garri son was installed in Syene leading to a 'new' settlement called Aswan.43 Being more or less the only Muslim settlement in Upper Egypt Aswan developed into a centre of Muslim education with its own autonomous traditions.44 Of these groups of new settlers, the tribe of the Rabica (later known as Banü Kanz45) ap parently formed a kind of local aristocracy. Their leaders carried the title Kanz ad-Daula 'treasure of the realm.' But only under the Fatimide ruler al-Häkim (*985-^1021, caliph from 996)46 and the vizier Badr al-Gamâlï (vizier from 1071-1094)47 were churches transformed into mosques or new mosques built. Gradually, Arabic superseded Coptic as the local vernacular 48 And yet, a lo cal monastery (Deir Anba Hadra, formerly known as Monastery of St. Simeon) was founded upon the hills west of Elephantine and Syene/Aswan as late as the tenth century, which was abandoned, as it seems, in the 13th century only.49 Already in the last decades of the Fatimides and especially after their fall, raids by Nubians or former Fatimide loyalists threatened the town of Aswan, so that in 1173 Saladin sent his brother Türän Sah south, who pushed for ward until he reached Ibrim. Under the Ayyubids (1171-1252), the general decline of the region commenced. A contestation between the local tribe of the Rabïca/Banû Kanz and Mamluks lead to anarchy and turmoil in the region.

While a small part of former Aswan remained a village of no importance, the rest of the town was re-inhabited only in the 19th century.50 However, the ancient settlements were not left untouched, but fell prey to extensive sebah -digging and reuse of easily accessible parts of stone architecture.51 The initial spark for the excavations52 on Elephantine has been the appear ance of Aramaic papyri on the antiquities markets in 1904, which were pub lished already in 1906 by Cowley and Sayce.53 Almost simultaneously, a Ger man and a French mission asked for permission to excavate on the island, and the area was divided in Solomonic fashion by Gaston Maspero, the di rector of the Egyptian Service des Antiquités.54 While Otto Rubensohn and Friedrich Zucker excavated the Western half of the area for the Berlin Mu seum,55 a French team conducted by Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau and Jean Clédat worked in the Eastern section.56 Shortly after the First World 50 See Cornelius von Pilgrim, Kai-Christian Bruhn &amp; Adel Kelany, The Town of Syene.

The gods Khnum (an anthropomorphic deity with a ram s head) and Satet (a goddess in human guise) form the divine pair of the cataract region (to whom Satet s sister, the goddess Anuket, joins to form a triad).73 Whereas the Temple of Satet existed already in the 3rd millennium on the island,74 no archaeolog ical structure ascribed to the Temple of Khnum has an earlier date than the beginning of the 2nd millennium.75 Over the centuries, however, the Khnum temple gained importance at the expense of the Satet-temple and develops into the principal sanctuary of the island. In addition to these temples, various chapels for other gods had been erected on the terrace of the Khnum-temple. In the sister-town Syene, a temple of Isis is attested.76 Upon the island Sehel (or rather Sehelnarti), which lies about 2 km south west of Elephantine and houses the famous Stela of Famine,77 a sanctuary ex isted that was originally devoted to the goddess Satet, but the cult there was rededicated later to the goddess Anuket.78 Under the Ptolemies, a cult was practised there not only for the regional triad (Khnum, Satet, and Anuket), but also for a local form of Osiris(?) under the name "The God in the West."79 /.-C. au Vif siècle J.-C. d'après les sources hiéroglyphiques des templesptolémaïques et romains, Monographies Reine Elisabeth 13, Turnhout 2009. 73 For the two goddesses see Dominique Valbelle, Satis et Anoukis, Mainz 1981. 74 Dreyer, Elephantine VIII: Der Tempel der Sätet. 75 See Werner Kaiser, Zum Chnumtempel des Neuen Reiches, in: W.

Sauneron once es timated the total amount of fragments to be lOO'OOO pieces.102 Another part of the documentation kept within the temple must have been the archive of the priests of the Khnum-temple, upon which the latter part of this paper will focus. The Demotic papyri cover, insofar as their date can be ascertained, a time period from 577 BC to 25/26 AD103, after which date os traca became the principal writing material. However, all matters of impor tance, and hence official texts, had to be in Greek or Latin, and the latter only if military matters were addressed. The majority of texts can be dated to the 4th century BC,104 and another large group to the reign of the Ptolemies, with a concentration in the period from Ptolemy II to Ptolemy IV (285/284-204 BC) and Ptolemy VIII (116-107 and 88-80 BC).105 For the papyri106, the major textual genres are letters, accounts, and offi cial documents; other text types are underrepresented.107 Beside the archive of the Khnum-temple-priests, the Berlin material permits reassembly of other, minor archives, such as a family archive from Aswan (which, however, was 101 See the editor's preliminary remarks, Joachim Friedrich Quack, Imhotep.

Zauzich refers to 590 BC as the earliest date, but, as Günter Vittmann pointed out to me, this text has been dated into the reign of Psamtik V = Amyrtaios and hence to the period 31.12.401-29.01.400 BC, see Michel Chauveau, Les archives d'un temple des oasis au temps des Perses, BSFE 137, 1996, 32-47: 44-47. Thus the earliest dated text would be pBerlin P 23595 dated to the 13th regnal year of Pharaoh Apries (i.e., 577 BC), see Zauzich, Ägyptische Handschriften II, 126 (Nr. 222). 104 Zauzich, Ägyptische Handschriften II, V. 105 Apparently, the early Ptolemaic tax receipts issued in Demotic are limited to the time pe riod from the reign of Ptolemy II to that of Ptolemy IV, see Vleeming, Ostraka Varia, 6, and Friedhelm Hoffmann, Zu den demotischen Ostraka, in: G. Dreyer et al., Stadt und Tempel von Elephantine. 33V34./35. Grabungsbericht, MDAIK 64, 2008, 63-151: 134. According to the observations of Hoffmann, the volume of letters and accounts written on ostraca rises in Roman times (in opposition to those on papyrus), whereas official communication between the various administrative entities only uses the Greek language, see Hoffmann, in: G. Dreyer et al., MDAIK 64, 2008, 134-135. 106 In what follows, the texts will be quoted according to the editions plus a reference (inso far as the text has been included there) to Cary J.

Before turning to these texts, a few word about the organisation of an Egyptian temple might be useful. A temple and its priests Egyptian temples in the last centuries of the 1st millennium BC were lead by prophets and the lesonis ,110 While the former (at small temples maybe only one or even none)111 were responsible for cult and rituals, the task of the lesonis112 was the administration of the temple. This would not have been a specific job profile, rather, each temple would have had traditional ways of ad-hoc-dealing with the necessary issues, which may have interfered with tasks of other offices, sometimes more, sometimes less fitting to the Egyptological or Papyrological assumptions about these offices. Hierarchically beneath this leading class stood a priestly class called archis tolistesni followed in rank by the so-called wab-priests, who actually con summated the daily rituals for the cult, which did not call for the presence of the prophet. The priesthoods received their supplies from the temple, usually with bread and beer114, and were organised into phyles. From the 3rd mil lennium BC up to the Ptolemies, each temple had four phyles. With the com mencement of the Canopus-decree (in the year 238 BC), this changed to five 108 These are the papyri Berlin P 13593-13601, see Zauzich, Ägyptische Handschriften II, 33-39. Of these, however, only one, pBerlin P 13593, has been edited, see Erich Lüddeckens, Ägyptis che Eheverträge, ÄA 1, Wiesbaden 1960,64-69 Urk. 28; Martin, in: Porten, The Elephantine Papyri in English, 19961, 366-370/ 20112, 365-369 (Dok.

Günter Vittman referred me to the paper of Michel Chauveau, according to which these papyri should be dated to the reign of Psamtik V = Amyrtaios, see Chauveau, BSFE 137, 44-47; for the identification Psamtik V = Amyrtaios, see Werner Huß, Ägypten in hellenistischer Zeit, 332-30 v. Chr., München 2001,43 note 6. 110 See the introduction by Martin, in: Porten, Elephantine Papyri, 19961,281—283/20112, 280 282, as well as still Walter Otto, Priester und Tempel im hellenistischen Ägypten. Ein Beitrag zur Kulturgeschichte des Hellenismus, 2 vols., Leipzig &amp; Berlin 1905 &amp; 1908. Ill To date, the texts from Elephantine mention a 1st prophet only, see Martin, in: Porten, Ele phantine Papyri, 19961,281. However, a list of witnesses from the Persian era mentions a 4th prophet, so that it can be surmised that the temple of Khnum also had four prophets, see Martin, in: Porten, Elephantine Papyri, 19961, 281. 112 This is the Greek representation of the Egyptian title mr-sn. 113 A designation for priests responsible for the clothing of cultic statues or other cultic objects, see Otto, Priester und Tempel I, 83-86. 114 The provision with bread is mentioned in pBerlin P 15619,4-5 (Zauzich, DPB III): a provision for the priests of 5 bread loaves and an amount of 8 1/3 loaves per day is equal to an amount of 250 loaves per month. The text lacks any specification for how many priests the amount was intended.</page><page sequence="20">232 Matthias Müller phyles.115 The next class would have been scribes. Specific tasks were fulfilled by officials/priests called pastophoroi116, and others, such as singers or trum peters,117 which were in all probability members of the lower sphere of the local elites. We should, however, allow for overlap in the task profile with wab priests or even the prophets118, since the priest fulfilling these offices would have been recruited from these groups. What is missing from the Elephan tine documentation so far are the choachytes119, i.e., those who sprinkle water during the cult for the deceased, as well as mummification priests. The rea son might be that the great tombs with ancestor-cults and veneration of the deceased were not on the island itself. Since the temples acquired and possessed land, life-stock, and personnel over the centuries via donations and gifts, these institutions also had herds men, bakers, fishermen, work- or craftsmen120, deliverers, slaves, etc. prophets lesonis archistolistes wab-priests scribes pastophoroi personal etc. Schematic representation of hierarchy levels of a temple For the temples of Aswän/Elephantine, one must add that in the region be tween Aswan and Gabal el-Silsilah (about 65 km to the north), the topography 115 See Stefan Pfeiffer, Das Dekret von Kanopos (238 v.

In opposition to the Aramaic texts, however, these sources do not reveal anything about the coex istence with the Judean population on the island125, except for a letter, accord ing to which the sender suffered some misfortune, a fact for which he blamed an Aramean(?).126 The Demotic sources speak more often of issues with Nu bians, even if only from the Ptolemaic period onwards.127 121 See Joseph Gilbert Manning, Land and Power in Ptolemaic Egypt.

Whether the letter of a man (pBerlin P 13553, reign of Ptolemies) to the 1st prophet Esnebonchis concerns issues with the distribution and lease of temple land is impossible to decide, see Zauzich, Ägyptische Hand schriften II, 16.

However, when Cambyses II s armies con quered Egypt128 in 526 BC129, not even the cataract region escaped unnoticed. Early modern historians tended to give credit to the narrative presented by Herodotus and others that Cambyses and his troops left a wake of devastation. Even more so since the famous letter of the Judean priesthood at Elephantine to the governor of Jerusalem, Bagohi, from 407 seemed to confirm this, as did a Demotic graffito that seemingly mentions the narrative.130 However, a funda mental study of Posener on the Persian dominion argued that the Greek histo rians' narrative is nothing but exaggerated propaganda.131 The archaeological situation upon the island does not show any traces of Persian destruction132 and the mentioned graffito is also understood today in a different historical context.133 In addition, currently prevailing descriptions of Persian-Egyptian history refrain from upholding said narrative of the Persian wreaking havoc all over Egypt.134 However, recent historians tend to favour the Greek narrative 128 For the historical background, see Pierre Briant, From Cyrus to Alexander.

Hughes139 corrected this reading for one of the documents (pLoeb I), so that this has to be excluded from the discussion140 and should be assigned to the archive of the Persian local administrator Prnw (Demotic, Persian Farnavâ141 ).

The local wab -priests annually elected a per son to hold the office. During the period of the Persian dominion over Egypt, such elections were to be confirmed by the satrap, the representative of the Persian king liable only to the latter; in later times this approval was part of the duties of the eparch, the district governor. In a specific case, the priests of the Temple of Khnum at Elephantine seem to have strayed from convention, such that the satrap deemed it inappropriate to contend their choice, as he bluntly points out to them in his letter: Pherendates, to whom Egypt is entrusted, says to all the priests of Khnum, Lord of Elephan tine: Thus says Pherendates: There are the tvab-priests whom the heri-idebu2 brought before me saying: "Let them be made lesonis" even though among these priests is one who had fled - the order was given to search for him -, one of them is another man s servant. Such people cannot be made lesonis. Now, the wab-priest suitable to be made lesonis - (a) great man whom I will allow to hold (the office of lesonis), without him having destroyed anything, (he is the one) who will be chosen according to what Darius (the) king has ordered. Such a person is suitable to be made lesonis\ Now, the priest who will be chosen to be made lesonis - (only) one of that kind will be chosen and brought according to what king Darius has decreed. The wafc-priest who will be discovered to have destroyed something or who is another man s servant - do not let such people be brought to be made lesonisl Take due notice of that! Satibara knows this order. pBeriin P 13540 (Demotic, Persian period; April 21st, 492 BC)143 Already in May of that year, a man by the name of Eskhnumpmetis is addressed in a letter of the Persian commander of the fortress of Syene as lesonis.144 In June, this man received a missive in the form of a legal document that confirms the receipt of money from a third party: Neferibrêm akhet greets Es [khnum] pmetis, the \le]sonis: May Re let his (the addressees) lifetime be long! You satisfied my heart with the quarter of the money, which you ascribed to Inkhy(?) so as to give them to me. You gave it to me. My heart is satisfied with it.

The temple-archive might have served as a depository for legal documents, yet, due to the lack of detailed documentation of the find spot, it is impossible to decide whether the following deed of donation regarding a prebend of a temple office comes from the temple- and from a private archive: Year 12, Mesore, of king Darius.149 The 'bearer of Re' Espmetis, son of Bakrenef, his mother is Renpetnefret, to the lady Tash ereteniah, daughter of Espmetis, her mother is Renpetnefret: I have given you the third part of my share of the office of ship s scribe and the office of district scribe that belongs to me from my father.

During the reign of the Ptolemies151, things also changed at Elephantine: Egypt's southern border was once again moved south to the 2nd cataract152, meaning that Elephantine/Assuan was no longer a direct border region. In the reign of Ptolemy III, the organisation of the temple priesthood was changed by introducing an additional, 5th phyle.153 Locally, the importance of Aswan rose as Elephantine's diminished. However, the temple area on the island was 148 Zauzich, DPB III. 149 This equates to the period from 24.11.-23.12.510 v.

Nevertheless, more than 250 years after the events referred to above, during the reign of the Ptolemy IV, a similar picture emerges from the documentation. In the year 219 BC a man named Eskhnumpmetis, son of Esnebonkhis, wants to become the lesonis of the Temple of Khnum. For this purpose he draws up a letter to Herakleides the governor of the south of Egypt asking him to campaign for him at the election: If it pleases you, then pursue my affair before the head of the Thebaid and ensure that I am made lesonis of Khnum for the 20 (deben ) silver, because of which I have written to the head of the Thebaid! Their date of payment: year 3 Epiphi 1 (deben) silver 5 kite year 4 Paophi 1 (deben) silver Tybi 1 (deben silver) Pharmuthi 1 (deben) silver 5 kite. Makes (in total) 5 (deben) silver again. pBerlin P 13543 (Demotic, Ptolemaic period, August 11th 219 BC) 154 The attempts of Eskhnumpmetis met with success, as is apparent from a letter addressing him three years later as lesonis. It has been written to the head-administrator of Thebes: "May the emmer of the district of Teshtores155 be gathered into the storehouses according to the receipt of measuring that has been brought in year 5 until it is known what has to be brought in addition. And it (the emmer) should be collected until the 21st of the month." May the emmer of the temple assets of Khnum be gathered as mentioned above. That emmer which has been given by the assets of Khnum for Pharaoh should be brought into the storehouse of Pharaoh until the head-administrator of Thebes comes. Accordingly orders should be given. Do not delay a moment while there is emmer on the street! pBerlin P 15522 (Demotic, Ptolemaic period, April 2nd 216 BC)156 In the very same year, i.e., 216 BC, he sent a priest to Alexandria to participate in the festivities celebrating the victory at the Battle of Raphia.157 154 Zauzich, DPB I; Martin, in: Porten, Elephantine Papyri, 19961, 311—312/20112, 310-311 (Dok.Cll). 155 The southernmost administrative entity of Egypt at that time. 156 Zauzich, DPB I; Martin, in: Porten, Elephantine Papyri, 19961, 313-314/20112, 312-313 (Dok.

You dispatched these letters and I have taken notice of these matters because of which you wrote. You wrote concerning these 2 silver (deben): "Tiqi made me give them (seil, the money)." I asked Tiqi and he told me that it was you who wrote to him concerning them to give them to me.160 What I could (do), I did. They (the money) have been reckoned under the sums about which you wrote to me. It has been written to Nekhthminis, son of Sokhotes, who inspects the temple of Elephantine. Written by Belles in year 18,28th Thoth. pBerlin P 15521 (Demotic, Ptolemaic period)161 Sundry other information from the Elephantine archives Further documents from the Ptolemaic period record (among many other things) problems of the priesthood with the organisation of constructions works, as a master builder needs to be requested from elsewhere: The H'afo-priests reported to me: "We have here two days of building." If the master-builder Psenpelaias could come up and accomplish the two days of building (task), he shall come. Preferably he should come at the day of the sprinkling of water to clean the temple (?). 158 Similar garlands had earlier been sent to Memphis already by the Khnum-priest, as a still unpublished letter (pBerlin P 15620) from the pre- or early Ptolemaic archive of Eskhnump metis, son of Psamtik shows, see Zauzich, Ägyptische Handschriften II, 69. 159 Wilhelm Spiegelberg / Walter Otto, Eine neue Urkunde zu der Siegesfeier des Ptolemaios IV und die Frage der ägyptischen Priestersynoden, SBAW.PPH 1926.2, München 1926, 3-17; Martin, in: Porten, Elephantine Papyri, 19961, 315-316/20112, 314-315 (Dok.

You wrote: 'Look, the accounts have been balanced.' Write (also) to the priests (in) these matters! Stop seeing it as your exclusive business, for it is a business of the four phyles. Pahetneter, son of Epmetshepsi, is a smart man. He is somebody able to inspect a matter without causing annoyance(?) for the priests and the god as well. I am content with him. However, I do not know who is chosen in the hearts of the priests. The people will take care not to do anything that is improper. Yet, when you wrote in a matter concerning it, it may be ordered not to allow that anything will be done (against) that he inspects in the temple, in the town or wherever he inspects! It is to be ordered to give to him the books he wants (to consult) to inspect the things that went astray/awry. For these are issues the god profits from. Further you wrote to me concerning Osoroeris, that I quarrelled with him although you said to me that I would not be on my guard against anybody.

As the text states, he left the letter with the priest of Philae, so that the preserved papyrus, which was found on Elephan tine, might actually be the copy thereof.168 Voice of Harpkolluthos before Spotus, Khnumemakhet and Osor[oeris], priests of Haroeris: Oh may Re cause their (the addressees') lifetime to be long!

Yet we were told: "They have gone south to the land of the Nubians." Did it not penetrate into your minds that we would care more about the situation you are in than you do? We fear Khnum more than you do! All the rigours we faced on our journey we accepted to keep our gods safe.169 When this letter reaches you, return to your temple! Your breath (of life) may be sound. Do not cease to go at night to the Abaton! Do not let the god punish me in any way! I asked Nepherpres, the prophet of Khnum, about the well-being of the temples. There is no harm.

I did not tarry to come to meet you rising early today to come to Philae to stay with you for it was near and dear to me. You, however, consider us as enemies. Our hearts are more well-disposed towards the god than yours. When you see this letter, do not hesitate (to return) to your temple! pBerlin P 15527 (Demotic, Ptolemaic period; prob. 187 BC)170 It has been surmised that the absence of these priest in Nubia might be con nected with the turmoil under Ptolemy V and hence might have been an at tempt to abscond. Yet, it seems that the priests from south of Elephantine did not enjoy the best reputation when it came to their conduct of office. A text recording the communication of a god with a mortal171 lists transgressions 166 Zauzich, DPB III, P. 13549. The remainder of the letter contains advice concerning the ad dressees conflict with another man and deliberations that the sender of the letter had been told some other people had tried to denounce him with the addressee. 167 We do not know, however, what the purpose of Harpkolluthos'journey and what his business in Syene was. 168 Upon the verso is written only 'to the priests of Khnum', usually taken to be the abridged form of the address and hence pertaining to the Haroeris-priests. 169 That riverine journeys upon the Nile were connected with certain perils was apparently not just an empty phrase, as shown in the letter pBerlin P 15513, Zauzich, DPB III, P. 15513. 170 Zauzich, DPB I, P. 15527; Martin, in: Porten, Elephantine Papyri, 19961,319—320/20112,318— 319 (Dok.

If it is a priest who took the money in year 6, may the document be brought to me! pBerlin P 13584 (Demotic, Ptolemaic period)174 As can be gathered from the above, we meet in the texts a local priesthood that attempts to push through their particular interests against the respective cen tral administration by escaping the latter's direct control, irrespective of the time period. This, however, might in itself also be a kind of modern histori cal narrative. Not surprisingly, these texts do not tell anything about cultic or ritual issues. 172 See Hermann Junker, Das Götterdekret über das Abaton, DA WW, Phil.-hist.
