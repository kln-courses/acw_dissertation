<plain_text><page sequence="1">A. . Johns Ph. D. : MALAY SUFISM as illustrated in an anonymous collection of 17th century tracts. Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, No. 178, Vol. XXX, Part 2, 1957, 111 pp. This treatise is a thesis to satisfy University of London requirements for the Ph. D. degree. As its date of publication the cover mentions August 1957, but in fact this issue appeared only a few months ago. The subject of this thesis is a number of Sufi tracts bound in a single volume forming No 11648 of the Marsden Collection in the library of</page><page sequence="2">BOEKBESPREKINGEN. 281 the London School of Oriental and African Studies. So far these tracts had escaped the notice of Malay scholars, save only that the original European owner of the MS., William Marsden, translated and pub lished a few excerpts from them in his Malay dictionary (1812). The tracts are anonymous but there can be little doubt as to their origin and age. The language in which they are written is called in the text language of the people of Pasai ? which refers us to XVIth and XVI Ith century Acheh ? and, moreover, the archaic spelling and the use of obsolete words and old morphological forms point to the same remote period of Malay literature. Therefore, there is a good deal to be said in favour of the editor's belief that the author was one of Shamsu -D?n's students turned schoolmaster to another generation of North Sumatran Sufis (p. 33). At all events, these pamphlets belong to the school of the Indonesian followers of Ibn al-cArabi, a gnostic about whose orthodoxy the house of Islam is divided but whose In donesian adherents, more or less outspokenly pantheistic, met with the sharpest condemnation in the writings of N?ru -D?n al-R?n?r?. In the recent volumes of this periodical quite a number of articles and notes have been dedicated to R?n?r?'s life and writings, whereas in the last decades many a Leiden thesis has treated of Indonesian ? including North Sumatran ? mysticism, so that in his Introduction Dr Johns justly remarks that detailed study of the doctrinal develop ment of Islam in Indonesia has been almost exclusively a Dutch preserve. Nevertheless, we are not of the opinion that Dr Johns in preparing this thesis for an English university has trespassed on our ? supposed ? preserves. On the contrary, we welcome his contri bution to the study of Sumatran mysticism as a laudable sign of in creasing interest in the history of Indonesian Islam outside this country. It is true, already some twenty years ago the J.M.B.R.A.S. (Vol. XV, Pt. II; 1937) contained a voluminous paper (130 pp.) on Muham madan Mysticism in Sumatra by R. L. Archer. This too was a thesis, the first of its kind to appear in the English speaking world, as it was written for the College of Missions, Hartford, Conn. U.S.A., under the guidance of professor W. G. Shellabear, the well-known Malayist. There is, however, a marked difference between these two theses. Far and away the greater part of Archer's paper is taken up by a statement concerning Muslim mysticism in general, a list of mystical MS. litera ture in the Malay language, a synopsis of the famous Hikam of Ibn cAta' Allah (died 709/1309) and a translation of a very full Malay commentary on this work. The latter part of the paper is made up by about 35 pages on mysticism in Sumatra containing: a. a brief outline of its history; b. an analysis of the Fath al-c?ri]ln, a treatise on the teachings of the Naqshbandi order (this treatise, written in Malay and printed in Cairo, was much in vogue in the last century) ; c. a descrip tion of the suluk and ratib ceremonies; d. an extract from an article on tasawwuj, written in Malay by Dr . A. . Amrullah (alias Hadji Rasul) and published in the Muhammadiyah Alm?nak 1932?1933.</page><page sequence="3">282 BOEKBESPREKINGEN. From this summary it will have become apparent that Archer's paper, while living up to its title in giving a certain amount of infor mation concerning the spread of certain types of Islamic mysticism in Sumatra in comparatively recent times, is almost silent upon the pecu liar kind of mysticism that flourished in North Sumatra (and Java) in an earlier period. It was during that period, round about 1600, that the two most renowned heterodox mystics lived: Hamza of Fansur (i.e. Barus in Tapanuli, once famous for its export of camphor) and Shamsu -D?n (died 1630). It seems that they and their adherents held the field until a reversal of royal favour under the successors of Iskan dar Muda brought the fiercely intolerant R?n?ri to the fore (1637? 1644). R?n?ri was a protagonist of the orthodox interpretation of Ibn al-cArabi. After him came cAbd al-Ra'uf of Singkel (W. Coast of Acheh) who on his return from Mecca (after 1661) propagated the Shatt?r?ya order in Acheh. But it is not in the vicissitudes of mysticism in XVIIth century Acheh that Dr Johns' interest lies. His primary aim is to present indigenous Islamic writings which, in view of the fact that as yet little of ancient mystical literature in Malay is accessible to scholars, is certainly a useful thing to do. His further aim is to emphasize the international character of the teachings of these tracts, unimpaired by local conditions (which boils down to the ? not altogether novel ? statement that the Sumatran mystics were faithful but unimaginative adepts of foreign doctrines). In pursuance of this aim the plan of the thesis is as follows : Io. a short sketch of the teachings of Ibn al-cArabi and cAbd al-Karim al-J?l?, based upon the books of Affifi (Mystical Philosophy of Muhyid-Din ibni 7-cArabi, Cambridge, 1937) and Nicholson (Stu dies in Islamic Mysticism, London, 1914) ; 2?. a synopsis of the teachings of the tracts ; 3?. a discussion of their relation to other contemporary works and an attempt to assign them to a school ; 4?. texts and translations; 5?. an appendix containing fragments translated from: a. Muhammad b. Fadlull?h's al-Tuhfa al-mursala ila -nab?, Cod. or. Leiden 5690; b. Shamsu -D?n's Nur al-Daq?'iq (J.R.A.S. 1958) ; c. a tract by Hamza al-Fans?ri, edited by Doorenbos, De ge schriften van Hamzah Pansoeri, Leiden thesis 1933 ; d. R?n?r?'s Jaw?hir al-cul?m fi kashf al-macl?m, MS. Marsden Collection no 12151 (this fragment together with the Malay text), and e. a translation of a Javanese text quoted and translated into Dutch by Zoetmulder in his Leiden thesis Panth?isme en Monisme in de Javaansche Soeloek-Litteratuur (1935). The results of Johns' investigation are formulated on pp. 31?34. First he points out the difference between the doctrine of Hamza as</page><page sequence="4">BOEKBESPREKINGEN. 283 expounded in his Shar?b al-c?shiqln and the teaching of the tracts. Then he shows that the latter links up with Shamsu -D?n, and especially with an Arabic work of his (the Jauhar al-Haq?'iq), by adducing a series of parallelisms which is too striking to be fortuitous. This diver gence between the teaching of Hamza on the one hand ? whose doc trine in his opinion is closer to Ibn al-cArab? and al-J?l? ? and that of our tracts and Shamsu -D?n on the other, prompts him to ask: When exactly did this framework of the seven grades originate ? It is the opinion of the author that it appeared first in al-Tuhfa al-mursala ila -nab?, a treatise by an Indian mystic Muh. b. Fadl ull?h, and "on which one commentary was written expressly for the people of Acheh" (p. 33). Perhaps it would have been more prudent to say that probably the Sumatran mystics got acquainted with the doctrine through the Tuhfa, a book widely read in Indonesia at the time. Whether or not the doctrine of the seven grades was first developed in this treatise is a question which our limited knowledge of the history of Muslim mys ticism in India does not permit us to decide. The author refers to the description of MS. 178 in Van Ronkel's Suppl. Cat. Arab. MSS. Batavia in support of his statement that one commentary of the Tuhfa was written expressly for the people of Acheh. This MS. was written in Acheh. Van Ronkel says : "The treatise itself is referred to by the commentator as : ris?ia ursilat min al-diy?r al-hindiyya ila -jaz?ra al macm?ra al-ashiyya etc.". These words show that the commentator was aware of the Indian origin of the Tuhfa on which he was going to comment. But there is still another commentary which was written expressly for the use of Indonesian Muslims, viz. Ith?f al-zak? bi-sharh al-Tuhfa. Ibrahim al-K?r?m (died A.H. 1101/1689) composed this commentary by direction of his master Ahmad al-Qush?sh? of Medina, in order to impart the 'correct' (i.e. orthodox) interpretation of the Tuhfa to his Indonesian coreligionists, as already stated by Brockelmann (G.A.L. II : 418) and Rinkes (thesis pp. 56/57). Since al-Qush?sh? died in 1661, the Ith?f must have been written before that year. The Tuhfa itself dates from 1590, which leaves about half a century for the consolidation of its position as the principal textbook of speculative mysticism in this area. For that it must have been, otherwise it would not have been reinterpreted from Medina. Coming to the last page of Dr Johns' introduction, where he em phasizes the homogeneity of Islam at this time (and in this area) by drawing attention to parallel happenings in India and Indonesia: it is a fact that there was an orthodox reaction in Acheh after the death of Iskandar Muda, and that a few years earlier the Mogul emperor Shah Jahan (1627?1658) had inaugurated a new religious policy aiming at the extermination of Hinduism. It may readily be supposed that the rumours about events in India strengthened the hopes of the orthodox faction in Acheh, temporarily</page><page sequence="5">284 BOEKBESPREKINGEN. out of power since the king himself was an adept of heterodox mysti cism. It had to wait till the death of Iskandar Muda and the accession of a less powerful personality to the throne for an opportunity to assert itself. In the subsequent persecution of heterodox mystics al-R?n?ri (the man from Rander in Gujarat) exerted himself by word and deed. But it seems far-fetched to find an indication of his work as a polemist against the syncretists in India in his declaration that the Malay ver sion of the Ramayana might be used as toilet paper. For this only means that since in the Ramayana the name Allah does not occur, the paper on which it is written may be freely used for that purpose. The same advice would have been given by the mildest of faq?hs. So far the setting of the tracts. In the following pages we shall go into the translation of the treatises, for although in general Dr. Johns is succesful in conveying the meaning of the original, there are a number of places where his translation needs revision. What follows below is my translation of those passages which in my opinion have been inadequately rendered. Special attention will be paid to the fragment translated from the Javanese, because here the author moves in a field which apparently is far less familiar to him. Tract 1. ? 2. Know that the Pure Essence of God cannot be qualified in any way. If then you-are asked whether the manifold qualifications which are apparent now issue forth from it or not, answer that none of them issues from it, but that all its designations are stored away in the treasure house of its being. When God wished to manifest the inward aspect (huwiyya) of His absolute oneness (ahadiyya) which was hidden in His treasure house, He disclosed His lofty names, as is stated in His word: "I was a hidden treasure and I desired to be known ; then I created man 1 that he might know Me". By 'hidden treasure' the people of perfect knowledge hint at the hidden quint essence and the most holy absoluteness and the inner side of huwiyya, which is from all eternity. Thus, 'treasure' denotes the hidden Mystery. Another designation of this hidden Mystery is 'first determination', the total negation of every thing beside God, since this grade is essen tially the same as wahda. ? 2. When God contemplated His names through His knowledge, this action implied three things: Io. essence; 2?. attributes; 3?. names; these are the same which are referred to as ahadiyya, wahda and w?hi diyya in the books of some of the gnostics, while others call them cilm, calim and macl?m or cishq, c?shiq and macsh?q. Let not your attention be diverted by this variety of names, for what is designated by them is one and the same. The only difference lies in the order of what is designated by them, as ahadiyya denotes the essence, wahda the attributes and wahidiyya the names, but in reality essence, attributes and names are one and the same. In the same way the only purpose of the order of the grades that 1 Malay makhhk, creature, man.</page><page sequence="6">BOEKBESPREKINGEN. 285 you have seen in books written by some of the gnostics is to remind us of this order, viz. from the viewpoints of transcendence and im manence. That is to say : when you look (at creation) from the view point of immanence, you get the order of grades as mentioned above, and when you regard it from the viewpoint of transcendence, then you find therein nothing but God, who "has no equal". ? 5. (1. 4 From....) In point of fact, these names refer to one and the same, for what is called etc.and w?hidiyya; therefore, these three are different as to their names, whereas in reality they are one, because ahadiyya signifies the essence etc..... ? 6. (1. 3 God's purpose....) The benefit of God's veiling Himself with these veils is that the lover has to exert himself to seek Him ? hoping that perhaps he will be able to pierce the veil ? and to look upon the place of the Lord most High ? without asking how. All his efforts, however, spring from the grace which God bestows upon the lover, as...... etc. p. 50 (1. 1).... and that this manifold world is only the external manifestation of a being that is one. This manifoldness, however, exists only on the outside; for in reality there is no variety, as all varieties are His, without asking how, and all forms are His, without asking how, and all sounds are His, without asking how, etc. ? 7. The last words of this paragraph : wa'ill? ja -kull minhu, Mal. dan jika Hada dem?kian, moka sakalian-nya daripada-nya jua, can hardly mean anything else than : ... . and if such might not be the case, well, all things proceed from Him!, not: despite the fact that all things proceed from Him. ? 8 (1. 5.) Let not the utterings of those in ecstasy ? be they ever so right in point of fact ? mislead thee into neglect of the Law. The words of al-Hall?j : "I am God", were spoken in ecstacy, which con dition prevailed over him and was not brought about by any voluntary act of his. The Lord spoke on his tongue ? without any voluntary act of his ? so that in reality these words pertain to God, not to al-Hall?j. ? 9.

(End) Therefore we should leave the words in their books to God and have a sincere faith in them, so that God may grant us perfect guidance on account of our sincere faith in them, etc. ? 10. The last sentence: You must know.... etc. belongs after: from any aspect or at any time (6 lines before).</page><page sequence="7">286 BOEKBESPREKINGEN. (I. 14) With regard to the manifestations and what they display difference and distinction have a significance which is a matter of name, to the effect that by their names things are distinguished from one another, that is all 2 ; not to the effect that the difference of names disproves (lit. points away from) the essential unity, for in reality the Essence is One and there is no manifoldness in it, as it is the Essence of the Creator. Etc. ? 11. As in ? 6 the words: dengan tiada betapa are a translation of Arabic bil? kaifa, without asking how. These words are always added to warn the reader against an anthropomorphic interpretation. ? 13 (1.5; cf. Appendices 1 and 4) .....it cannot be attained by intellectual knowledge, perception, imagination or reasoning. (1. 9) It has an esoteric and an exoteric aspect. (1. 16) Its outward expression, as to its esoteric aspect, etc. ? 14 (1. 7) .... a perfect manifestation comprising all other.... ? 16 (Last sentence) ....while it (i.e. the intellect) obtains know ledge of the lofty attributes of God by considering the range of the obligations set down by the Law. (cf. ? 18) ? 17 (1.5) ....is named the Perfect Knower, i.e. he is endowed with the grace of perfect knowledge of God (the words : he.... God, are a gloss added to explain k?mil mukammal). ? 18. Know that knowledge of God's Essence is only attainable through His merciful and mysterious assistance. You will, however, learn to know God by His names and attributes through the teachings of the Law which is immutable in its provisions. And when you will have attained gnosis, oh journeyer who knows to observe transcendence and immanence in outer manifestness and hidden inwardness, you will surely attain the vision of God, bringing your heart into His holy presence and submerging your transitory existence in His loving nearness through the compelling attraction of His beauty, when the veil of darkness will be removed, so that you will gaze upon His lofty names and attributes in the macrocosm and the microcosm. Truly, He has revealed Himself to the men of perfect knowledge. Tract 2 explains the meaning of the (spurious) tradition : Whoso ever knows himself knows his Lord. In the second paragraph the author points out what is to be understood by 'self (diri), in order to establish the connection between man and God. Therefore, the trans lation of this paragraph should be as follows : ? 2. The meaning of 'self is this : The Fixed Prototypes subsist in God's knowledge which subsists in His Essence. The World of Spirits subsists in the Fixed Prototypes. The World of Ideas_subsists in the World of Spirits. The World of Bodies.... subsists in the World of Ideas. These four together are called the 'self. ? 3. When you have acquired thorough knowledge of the 'self as 2 The comma of the Malay transcription belongs after, not before hcmja.</page><page sequence="8">BOEKBESPREKINGEN. 287 explained above, you know God, for the Fixed Prototypes comprise the ideal prototypes of all things exterior to God's knowledge, all alike. The World of Spirits.... etc. ? 5. The gnostics who have attained perfection deny and affirm, that is to say: When they declare L? il?ha ill? 'll?h, i.e. God is the Only Being, they attribute non-being to the phaenomenal world and attribute being to God's Essence. The 'self is only the manifestation of God's Essence and Attributes, and that is why non-being is attributed to it. When it has been reduced to non-existence God's Absolute Es sence i.e. God's Real Being remains for ever. ? Menapikan (occurring here in ? 5 and in Tract 7 ? 9) and its opposite mengithbatkan are not only used in their ordinary meaning of 'deny' and 'affirm' but also in that of 'to attribute non-being to' and 'to attribute being to'. In this kind of literature, both in Javanese and Malay, napi often denotes Arab. macdum, non-existent. So for instance Schrieke, Het Boek van Bonang (Leiden, 1915) p. 112, last lines: Sira Pang?ran macd?m binafsihi, is glossed: sira Pang?ran napi. On p. 115 the same Arabic words are explained by: nora ing d?w?k?. Thus mac d?m = napi = nora, to be non-existent. Sometimes napi is a synonym of liwung, which in Javanese re presents Arab. al-catl, the void. So for instance Schrieke o.e. p. 94: napining Allah is followed by the glosse liwunging Allah, whereas liwung napi dh?t Allah is explained by: nora ing d?w?k? (= Arab. macd?m bi-nafsih?). Menapikan, therefore, may be used in the sense of : to consider as non-existent, to attribute non-being to, just like Jav. anap?kken (Zoetmulder, o.e. p. 199). Tract 3. ? 1 (1. 3). The true significance of knowing one's self is to know one's self as existing in God's knowledge, i.e. to know one's self as an object of His Knowledge. When you have realized this and, further, comprehend that God's Knowledge for ever coheres with His Knowing and His Knowing with His Being, then you certainly have grasped the connection with God and understand how it is that you are one with Him, etc. ? 2. If this be so it is the duty of everyone who strives after knowing God to know that He is eternal in His Essence and that this outer 'self will return to that Inward Essence. Said Shaikh Hamza: If ye, o seekers, really want to return to the state of 'hidden treasure', then be enamoured of your real self. That is the meaning of perpetual prayer. Etc. ? 3 (1. 7). What is called coming is the overflow of Pure Being into this world of possible existents, as the (actual) existence of pos sible existents is part of the manifestations of God in both worlds, the visible and the invisible. For this world of possible existents has neither</page><page sequence="9">288 BOEKBESPREKINGEN. being nor power, and what has neither being nor power cannot possibly exist by itself, as its "being" is only derived being. ? 4. Said Shaikh Hamza : This wisdom is shared by all the wise : Make yourself familiar with the form of self. Tread warily on the path towards knowing God. Whosoever studies with a teacher cannot go astray. ? 5 (1.3).For the many beings that are to be seen merely manifest the Being of the One, and the many attributes that are to be seen merely manifest the Attributes of the One etc. (1. 6). As it says in the Rubaci (name of a poem or a collection of poems by Hamza). Tract 4. ? 3. God brought into existence the World of Spirits, the World of Ideas, the World of Bodies and (the World of) Man, because He wished to manifest (more explicitly) His manifestations of Himself at the grades of Wahda and W?hidiyya. If then you are asked whether these four worlds exist at both grades, treat the question in a fundamen tal way and answer : These four worlds do exist at the grade of wahda, only in a general sense, i.e. as to their essence; likewise they exist at the grade of wphidiyya, but here their existence is qualified, i.e. they are determined as World of Spirits, Worlds of Ideas, World of Bodies and World of Man. That is to say, each of these four worlds in its own specific determination exists by virtue of the determinations (at the grade of w?hidiyya) mentioned just now; these, however, exist only in thought, i.e. as ideas, not as entities, i.e. they have no existence of their own. ? 4 (1. 5). And whosoever says that these four worlds exist at both grades in their present condition, viz. as separate entities, temporal in existence and bound to perish, that man is an unbeliever in the opinion of the gnostics, for that is tantamount to saying that temporality and dissolution reside in God. The only true answer to the question is that these four worlds all do exist at the grade of wahda, only in a general sense i.e. as to their essence, and that all of them exist at the grade of w?hidiyya, but that here their existence is qualified, i.e. they are deter mined as World of Spirits, World of Ideas, World of Bodies and World of Man. That is to say: each of these worlds in its specific determination exists by virtue of the determinations (at the grade of w?hidiyya) mentioned just now. These, however, are determinations existing only in thought, not in fact, i.e. their existence is ideal, not actual. Tract 5. ? 1 (1. 6). After : first determination, add : and that of wahda. ? 5 (1. 5). Predispositions and relations, read : Predispositions and indications (of further developments). (1. 6). These predispositions which lie hidden in wahda the men of</page><page sequence="10">BOEKBESPREKINGEN. 289 God call Lofty Letters when they represent the determination of all things which exist eternally in the Eternal Knowledge seen from the aspect of non-differentation ; when, however, these predispositions re present the determination of all things which exist eternally in the Eternal Knowledge seen from the aspect of differentation, they call them Fixed Prototypes. ? 7 (1.3).dengan nyata taf sili = in detail; not: in their generality. Tract 6. ? 1 (1. 2). When God wished to reveal Himself He manifested His attribute of knowledge, at which grade there became manifest in Him a seer.... etc. Tract 7. ? 3 (1. 7). sa-benar Hakk tacala ? dh?t allah, cf. Tract 3 ? 2 and Tract 12 ? 6 : sa-benar-benar dirinya ? dh?tuhu. Therefore, the pre ceding mir'?tu -haqq wa -haq?qa should not be translated : the Mirror of Reality and Truth, but: the Mirror of God and the inner reality (of creation), conformably to the Malay version and as explained in the next words : because the Essence of God and the inner realities of all things are reflected in it. (1. 9). tub oh yang menanggong = substratum. (1. 12).because the spheres of being and determination clearly originate from it. ? 4 (1. 2 and 5).a light unequalled in its essence, brightness and clearness, and without modality.. .. .... lights which have something like to their essence, their bright ness and their clearness ; they have modality.... etc. ? S (1.1.)? Ruh Insan ? Spirit of Man; there is no reason for a plural. ? 6. The Spirit of Man has many names. It is called the Spirit of Man because it gives life to man; in its turn it receives life from the Holy Spirit (ruh al-kudus) which is its life. Another name of it is heart (qalb), because it is by means of the 'heart' that man 'revolves' ideas and forms an opinion; but the heart of man is like a mould of light and the ruh al-kudus is the focus of the heart. ? In Arabic, qalb not only means 'heart', but also : mind. Berbal?k-bal?k is the translation of Arabic qallaba, to turn over and over, by which verb the meaning of qalb is explained, but this etymology of qalb given in the Arabic original becomes incomprehen sible in the Malay translation. ? 9 (1.1. but 3). For this reason the men of God attribute non-being to the various determinations as belonging to creation, and attribute being to God who is one etc.(cf. Tract 2 ? 5). Dl. 115 19</page><page sequence="11">290 BOEKBESPREKINGEN. Tract P. ? 5. The grade of il?hiyya (godhead) is the grade of the manifest ation of God's Essence under the name Allah. This name comprises and covers all His other names such as the Living One.... etc. By reason of this the gnostics teach that the name Allah is identical with as well as distinct from the other names and that is why they only make use of this name when practising dhikr. Tract 10. ? 5 (1. 5).to follow the path of extinction in God and immor talizing himself in God i.e. the substitution of his human attributes by the attributes of God which become apparent in him (literally: the shaking off of his human attributes while consolidating the divine ones which....;;). This takes place at the grade of those saints who have attained qurb naw?jil. This shaking off and consolidating is hinted at by the words of the creed : La il?ha ill? 'Hah. ? What the author means to say by his interpretation of the words fana' fi a baq?' bi Tl?h is : al-fan?' fl sif?ti Tl?h can sif?tihi. As to this, one may compare Ibn al-cArab?'s FusUs al-hikam (with the commentary of al-K?sh?m, Kairo, 1321) p. 118, where the author quoting a wellknown tradition says: fa-minn? man yak?nu -haqq samcahu wabasarahu wajamlca quww?ti jaw?rihihi etc.. The commentator remarks : al-mutahaqqiq bi -haqq huwa 'll?dhl fan? fl sif?ti -haqq can sif?tihi fa-q?ma -haqq maq?ma sif?tihi, aw fi dh?ti -haqq can dh?tihi fa-q?ma -haqq maq?ma dh?tihi etc. So beside substitution of attributes he distinguishes substitution of essence ? which is a higher stage than that of attributes. The commentator adds that the saints of the first named stage enjoy qurb al-naw?fil, those of the second stage qurb al-far?'id, which implies a still closer proximity to God. To them applies Qur'?n 8, 17: wa-m? ramait a idh ramaita walakinna 'U?ha ram?, "nor didst thou shoot when thou didst shoot, but God did shoot". The "nearness of the supererogatory works" derives its name from the wording of the tradition referred to above: L? yaz?lu 'l-cabd yataqarrabu ilayya bi -naw?fil hatt? uhibbuhu fa-idh? ahbabtuhu kuntu samcahu 'll?dhl yasmacu bihi wa-basarahu 'll?dhl yabsiru bihi.... etc., i.e.: The servant incessantly draws nearer to Me by supererogatory works so that I love him, and when I love him I am his ear through which he hears and his eye through which he sees etc. Tract 11. ? 1 (1. 2). The Fixed Prototypes, i.e. fixed in the divine knowledge, depend on the divine names. Within the divine knowledge they re present the primordial stage of the different forms comprised by that knowledge as predispositions within the essence.... etc. yacni yang nyata dengan nyata segala laku dhat Hakk tacala is the</page><page sequence="12">boekbesprekingen. 291 interpretation of: berpakaian shu'un dhatnya and may be omitted in the translation. Tract 12. ? 6 (1. 1). To symbolize the extinction in God and the immortalizing of oneself in God, the gnostics obliterate the line that is drawn in the essence as represented by that circle but preserve the place where the line was, only void of the line ? i.e. the Absolute represented by the dhat of that circle ? because the line represents the essence of the mystic's own being becoming manifest in God's knowledge which subsists in His Essence. So when the true gnostic loses the essence of his being in gnosis, ecstasy or contemplation, that what remains in his gnosis, ecstasy or contemplation is the Absolute Essence. He has certainly become extinct in God and achieved permanence in God. ? 7. With the gnostics that which symbolizes dhikr...... mura qabah...., tawajjuh .... and muskahadah...., is the same circle wherein a line is drawn (?). Appendix 4. Doorenbos, De Geschriften van Hamzah Pansoeri; p. 191 et seq. Know that the gnostics name the innermost essence of God 'non determination' because it cannot be attained by intellectual reasoning, knowledge or gnosis, while even the prophets and the saints stand bewildered. That is why the Prophet said: "Praise unto Thee! We have no adequate knowledge of Thee !".... First of all there was a fourfold particularisation, viz. into Know ledge, Being, Vision and Light. This fourfold particularisation is called : first determination. Because there was Knowledge, the knower and the known became distinct. Because there was Being, creator and creature became distinct. Because there was Vision, the seer and the seen became distinct. Because there was Light, that what is illuminated and that what illuminates became distinct. All these belong to the first determination ; knower and known, first and last, outward and inward became distinct by their names. To 'the known' the mystics give the name of: Fixed Prototypes; others call it the (latent) realities of things ; while still others call it the conceptual forms or the Spirit of relation. All these are reckoned as second determination. The spirits of man, of the animal kingdom and of the vegetable king dom are reckoned as third determination. The fourth and fifth deter minations are the corporeal determinations comprising all living crea tures in their endless variety of particular forms. Knowledge, Being, Vision and Light are not divorced from all these determinations, for were it not for these four, the four determinations (which come after the first) would not exist. For this reason the mystics say : The being of the world is the Being of God.</page><page sequence="13">292 BOEKBESPREKINGEN. As to the being of the world : contrary to our opinion the world has no being, as its being depends upon the One Being which differentiates itself. It is only our heedlessness which makes us think that the world has being. The first determination is called ahad and w?hid. When we consider the Essence in itself it is called ahad) when on the other hand we attribute to it its attributes and names, it is called w?hid, for ahad is called w?hid when it is considered as comprising creation in its entirety, from first to last. Appendix 3. Before trying my hand at an emended translation of the stanzas quoted in Zoetmulder's thesis pp. 109?110, 113 I wish to make a few preliminary remarks. The first is concerned with the meanings of a number of words which occur in these stanzas and are misunderstood by Zoetmulder as well as by Johns, following in his wake. These words are : aib, rasa nipun, b?nah, awali and makhum. 1. aib (st. 15 1. 7). Both Zoetmulder and Johns read aib (in Java nese spelling ha-ib, with aksara swara i) as ghaib and translate 'hidden ness' (Z. : verborgenheid ; Arabic ghayb). But there can be no doubt that ha-ib = Arab, gh?'ib, which in Arabic as well as in various Indonesian languages not only means 'hidden' but also: vanished, absent, non-extant. According to Javanese prosody lines 6 and 7 must be taken together, and rightly so, for instead of marking the beginning of a fresh sentence line 7 is a sequel to line 6. It conveys the same idea as the preceding line only couched in different words. Parallelisms of this kind are very frequent in Javanese poetry; they abound even in these few stanzas. Therefore, the translation of lines 6 and 7 should be : The maclum?t (intelligibles) are not yet in existence; their name is (they have to be called) : non-extant. 2. rasanipun (st. 16 1.4). The context leaves no doubt that this word is rasan + ipun, not rasa + nipun, as tentatively already sug gested by Zoetmulder (thesis p. 366) but eventually rejected by him in favour of the other interpretation. Johns has followed Zoetmulder in his translation of this line ("This being is... . beyond experience"). But here too both Zoetmulder and Johns have dissected the stanza wrongly. Lines 4 and 5 belong together ; line 5 gives the motivation of the preceding words so that in my opinion the correct translation is as follows : One cannot (even) talk about it, since the attributes and the names have not yet become manifest. 3. b?nah (st. 16 1. 6). Zoetmulder interprets b?nah as deriving from Arabic bayyina, decisive proof; Johns translates: outward sign, ap parently accepting Zoetmulder's derivation. But this word is not to be derived from the Arabic, but from Skr. bhinna. It means: distinct, different; one may compare J. Gonda, Sanskrit in Indonesia p. 85,</page><page sequence="14">BOEKBESPREKINGEN. 293 where besides Bai. bina Jav. bena(h) should have been mentioned. Here again Zoetmulder and Johns have failed to observe that lines 6 and 7 belong together. They form a sentence of a well-known syntactical structure viz. a negative communication followed by an exception introduced by anging (corresponding to Arabic l?. ... ilia....). The translation of these lines should be : For as yet nothing distinct (from Him) exists, Only He (is), which in Javanese of this kind is the common way of saying: For there still does not exist anything beside Him. One may compare the Jav. translation of the shah?da : Orana Pang?ran sabener? anging Allah uga} There is no god but Allah, and sentences like: norana amudjia ing a?on? anging sifat? amudji ing dhat?, only His attributes praise His Essence (Schrieke, Het Boek van Bonang, p. 95). 4. awali (st. 25 1. 5). Following Zoetmulder Johns has translated awali by return (Jav. bali, wall). But, as already stated by Van der Tuuk, Kawi-Bal.-Ned. Wdbk. s.v. wali, mawali (? awali) means: gumanti, sumilih, i.e. to take the place of, to replace. The reduplicated form i.a. can have iterative and intensive meaning 3 : (a)wali-wali = to change places repeatedly ; with negation : not change at all. Allah is said to be tan asipat wali-wali, not possessed of attributes which are subject to change (Schrieke o.e. passim). Obviously the words tan kena awali or tan (a)wali-wali are translations of Arabic l? tanqalibu so that the meaning of st. 25 1. 4 and 5 is : Not a single intelligible can be replaced by another (i.e. : the intel ligibles are not interchangeable, Arabic: al-macl?m?t l? tanqalibu). 5. makhum (st. 50 1. 8). Zoetmulder (o.e. p. 370) has a note on the possible meaning of makhum. Tentatively he suggests two ? in his opinion equally improbable ? derivations of this word, whereas in his translation of the stanza (o.e. p. 119) it is left untranslated. Johns omits the line without further notice. In my opinion the solution of this puzzling word is a very simple one. I take it as a scribal error for mafh?m. The manuscript is a not very old copy, dating from the first half of the XlXth century. It is written in Javanese character but it may have been, nay most probably was copied from an original in Arabic script (p?gon). A copyist not familiar with the Arabic language could easily read makhum instead of mafh?m. This stanza seems to convey the same idea as the passus from Ibn al-cArabfs Fut?h?t translated by M. As?n Palacios in his El Mistico murciano Abenarabi IV (Extracto del Bolet?n de la Academia de la Historia 1928) pp. 93, 94: "Cuando Dios hubo creado el mundo sin el Hombre Perfecto, es decir, sin el hombre en conjunto o compendio, comenz? por adaptar o confrontar la forma de ?ste con la forma del mundo entero. De modo que no hay parte alguna del mundo que no se encuentre en la forma 3 Cf.

Hecha esta adaptaci?n, separ? Dios al hombre del mundo. Y despu?s de esto, lo confront? idealmente con la majestad de los nombres divinos, y estos nombres aparecieron en ?l, al modo como aparecen en al espejo los im?gines a los ojos del que mira... . etc." ? All divine names becoming manifest in the Perfect Man he may well be called mafh?m al-asma', the meaning of all names. ? My second remark is concerned with the rules of Javanese prosody. When analysing the contents of these stanzas both Zoetmulder and Johns overlooked the valuable aid to translating tembang which is offered by Javanese prosody. So, for instance, by not giving heed to the guru wilangan of the dandanggula metre, i.e. the number of syllables prescribed for each line, Johns has failed to observe that in JZoetmul der's transcription of stanza 20 not less than eight syllables are missing after line 8. The XlXth century copyist cannot be blamed, for the MS. has a complete line of 12 syllables : 1. 8. Singgih amba singgih tu wan, 1. 9. Ja Muhammad singgih tuwan singgih djati, 1. 10. Ja amba ja Muhammad. Far more serious, however, is that neither of them heeded the caesurae, as already will have become apparent from the discussion of terms dealt with in the preceding remark. Therefore, a short exposition of the rules of caesura does not look out of place here. One should always keep in mind that Javanese poetry is primarily meant to be sung (or hummed), not to be read silently. In singing one needs breath, and therefore breathing places or caesurae have to be put in, first of all the minor caesurae or pedo tan, then the major pauses called ukaraA The pedotan (lit. : break, interruption) are distributed over each single line, preferably in such a way that they coincide with the end of a word or a small group or unit of words. The better a poet succeeds in reaching this goal the higher his art is valued. In a stanza of the dandanggula metre the pedotan have to be distri buted as follows : in 11. 1 and 2, each containing 10 syllables: 4-4-2 or 4-3-3 or 4-2-4; in 11. 3 and 8, 8 syllables : 4-4 or 3-3-2 or 3-2-3 ; in 11. 4, 6 and 10, 7 syllables: 4-3 or 3-4 or 2-3-2; in 1. 5, 9 syllables: 4-3-2 or 4-2-3; in 1. 7, 6 syllables: 4-2 or 3-3 or 2-4; in 1. 9,12 syllables: 4-4-4 or 4-3-3-2 or 4-3-2-3. The application of this scheme to stanza 16 gives the following result : 1. mala?kat/ kang mukarab/ sami, 2. tan amanggih/ ing kunhi/ taala, 3. tan na weruh/ ing anan?, 4 Cf. M. Hardjawiraga, Patokcm?ng njekaraken (Manual of metrical composition), Balai Pustaka serieno. 725, pp. 18, 25?29.</page><page sequence="16">BOEKBESPREKINGEN. 295 4. tan wonten/ rasanipun, 5. sipat asma/ pan durung/ lair, 6. b?nah pan/ durung ana, 7. anging/ d?w?kipun, 8. ?ngaranan/ wudjud mahal, 9. dad semata/-j in ajum/ anan?/ sepi, 10. sapa wruha/ ing kana. The p e dot an shows that one has to read dad semata-jin ajum (with contraction of the final a of semata with the initial a of ajin) and not dad semai (= Arab, dto samad) ajin ajum, as Zoetmulder did. Dae? semata is almost the same as wudjud mahal (= Arab, wuj?d mahd, pure being), so that by the use of these words lines 9 and 10 link up with line 8. Now the system of pedotan would meet the need of breathing places if every line contained a full sentence. Telegraphic brevity, however, is not the ideal of Javanese poetry. Most sentences contain more than the exact number of syllables allowed for in each line of a stanza of a given metre, so that they exceed the limits of one line. On the other hand the poet is not entirely free in fixing the length of his sentences : he has to observe the rules of ukara. In Javanese grammatical termino logy ukara means sentence, but when applied to versification it indicates the distribution within a stanza of the obligatory pauses that mark the end of a sentence and the beginning of a fresh one. In the case of the dandanggula metre the ten lines of each stanza have to be distributed over four, or at the utmost five, sentences, in this way : 11. 1, 2, 3 ; 11. 4, 5 ; 11. 6, 7 ; 11. 8, 9, 10 (or 1. 8 ; 11. 9, 10). So stanza 16, scanned completely, reads as follows 5 : 1. mala?kat/ kang mukarab/ sami, 2. tan amanggih/ ing kunhi/ taala, 3. tan na wer uh/ ing anan?.// 4. Tan wonten/ rasanipun, 5. sipat asma/ pan durung/ lair.// 6. B?nah pan/ durung ana, 7. anging/ d?w?kipun.// 8. Ingaranan/ wudjud makal.// 9. Dad semata/-jin ajum/ anan?/ sepi, 10. sapa wruha/ ing kana. The first half of stanza 23 may be quoted here to show that these rules are not too strict and that a certain measure of liberty is left to the poet. st. 23 : Lawan ana pralambin? malih, kadi mangsi kang ana (ing) wadah.// Sagung? aksara kab?h, ing dalem mangsi kumpul, ?ora b?da kurub sawidji.// etc. 5 / indicates a pedotan, //an ukara; the end of a line is marked by a comma; before an ukara by a full stop.</page><page sequence="17">296 BOEK BESPREKINGEN. My final remark regards the contents of the stanzas in general. The poem from which the quotations in Zoetmulder's thesis pp. 124?125 and 109?114 are taken, is not a spontaneous creation. It seems to be a rather amplified as well as simplified versification of a treatise on the doctrine of the seven grades, either Muhammad b. Fadlullah's Tuhfa itself (cf. Johns' extract on p. 101) or, more probably, a Javanese prose tract based upon it. Such tracts are found in the primbons ; see for instance Cod. Or. Leiden 7475, a copy of a primbon from Banjumas, pp. 73 sqq.6). No doubt a further scanning of primbon MSS. will bring to light other copies of the same tract in more or less divergent redac tions and similar texts. It is among treatises of this kind that one must look for the prose original of the tembang version quoted by Zoetmul der. A previous edition of the Arabic text of the Tuhfa accompanied by a translation, would facilitate the search for this tract. What follows now is a translation of the stanzas 6?14 (text in Zoet mulder, o.e. p. 124?125) which precede the stanzas translated by Johns in Appendix 3, by way of an introduction to the doctrine of the seven grades contained in the stanzas 15?25 and 50. The latter stanzas will be given in Jav. text and translation. 6. Phenomenal being is called metaphorical being because it exists only through its essence. Ideal being is not at variance with it, it is the same. The situation may be compared with that of Wisnu and Kresna. When Wisnu had assumed the form of Kresna, this outward form was a shadow of the real Wisnu, the essence of the noble Kresna. 7. All-powerful, the revered real Kresna is the one who is venerated by all the world, (although) nobody is aware of his activity. For the real Kresna is Wisnu; they are not individual persons: Essentially they are one. The reason for the creation of the world was to display the skil fulness of Lord Wisnu, revealing himself in (the outward form of) the noble Kresna. 8. The situation is comparable with that of a panel on which a picture is painted. In its entirety the picture is visible on the panel; its purpose is to represent something. The form of the panel is the form of the picture. They cannot be separated one from another.7 6 Cod. Or. Leiden 8586 is a copy in Latin character of this MS., made for Dr D. A. Rinkes. The tract referred to is on pp. 28?32. The framework of this treatise seems almost the same as that of the poem and even the words are sometimes identical, only the author, besides being rather wordy, is at great pains to give a running commentary as well, adding teges? ... to all and sundry. One of the major differences is that in the poetical version an undue amount of attention is paid to the question of the 'fixed prototypes' (a^y?m th?bita), once a very controversial point in Indonesian Islam. Zoetmulder (o.e. p. 121) already noticed the circumstantial treatment of this question and suggested that a number of stanzas on the acy?n might be interpolated. 7 Text: sangsaja atuduh. The meaning of these words escapes me.</page><page sequence="18">BOEKBESPREKINGEN. 297 only, the one along with the other. The picture, however, has the shape given to it by the painter, not a different one. 9. The Being of God is above form and outward appearance, it is not subject to change. But afterwards all visible things came into being and became mani fest in this world. The Being of God, however, is now as it was before. It does not suffer change or alteration, as it is everlasting. 10. The Being of God has no form or outward appearance; it shows no variety as it is not affected by the plurality of visible things. But an uninitiated person does not grasp the real situation. He sticks at the outward forms and his vision is blurred. He is quite at sea .8 because he has lost his way and gone astray. 11. But whosoever has been imparted true initiation knows all things he considers as 'possible existents' for what they really are. He does not stick at the visible things because he sees them as reflections in a mirror. A man whose vision has attained the Being of God sees all things which have metaphorical being as revealed in a mirror. 12. Whosoever knows Reality knows the being of shadows as non being 9, since in fact they are not. They only can act conformably to what they reflect. Their being as well as their movements are illusory. They only follow the movements of what they reflect, as shadows of the Real Being. 13. No creature whatsoever is devoid of the Being of God. Nothing exists outside the Being of the Lord Most High, all things alike being encompassed by Him. Even the smallest particle is not devoid of God, as everything is encompassed by Him, before the world expanded into being and afterwards. 14. Each single thing was encompassed by Him before the world expanded into being, as it existed already in its conceptual form. Before it came into actual being it was already destined in His Knowledge. After it has sprung into phenomenal existence its being remains the same. Through the power, will and knowledge (of God) everything is now as it was before, without any difference. 8 Text: upaman? lir dalom atuduh mar gl \ he is comparable to a road which shows the way?

The first is l? tacayyun (non-determination) i.e. the grade of voidness. The intelligibles are not yet in existence; they have to be called non-extant. This grade is named Absolute Essence. Nobody can attain the Essence of God; even among the prophets and saints there is none. 16. Not even the angels who are near (the throne) can attain the innermost Being of God, (as) nobody whosoever knows His Being 12. One cannot (even) talk about it, since the attributes and names have not yet become manifest. For there still does not exist anything beside Him. He is called Pure Being. This Pure Essence, the Self of Selves, still devoid of manifestation: who could have knowledge of it ? 17. Whosoever strives to know the real innermost Being, that man has gone astray and is playing with his life. Whosoever claims to know it, let him build a shed over the sky; let him pass into the bowels of the earth by bailing out the ocean; let him make a sun and a moon ! That is my counsel when you should claim to have reached the real innermost Being of God. 18. None of the (seven) grades is higher than that of ahadiyya; the (six) other grades are all below it. The second grade is called real wahda.13 The grade of wahda marks the beginning of determi nation; it is (the grade of) the Reality that is Muhammad, still subsisting in the Hidden Being of God, in the predispositions within His Essence. 19. For the inner realities of things are still undifferentiated one from another, being still together. In the predispositions within the Essence as yet no intelligible is distinct. In their primordial state at the grade of wahda they are still together, contained in the Reality that is Muhammad which marks the beginning of irradi ation, in the predispositions within the Essence. 20. Shaikh Muhyi -D?n, the Pole of Arab lineage, once said to him self: Inwardly I the most high do not shift; I am constantly within the circle of the Exalted Presence. I am You ; Muhammad is You and is Reality; I am Muhammad. 21. What is named real wahda is the Reality that is Muhammad, implied in the predispositions (within the Essence). Knowledge, Knower and Known are not yet distinct. (Beside the Reality that Translation of Arabic : Laisa l?dh?tihi w?qifun, quoted in the original language in the Javanese text edited by B. J. O.

The inner realities of all things are still together at the grade of real wahda; they are not yet differentiated one from another. 22. The gnostics compare real wahda to a seed. For in a seed stem, branches and leaves are contained, in a still undifferentiated state. Branches and leaves, they say, are comparable to you and me, in so far as we (too) have sprung from one and the same seed.14 23. Another simile is that wahda is comparable to the ink in an inkpot. All letters are together in the ink; as yet not a single one is distinct. A similar situation obtains in wahda: all letters 15 are extant (literally: are spoken), but on the outside you are I as long as we are not distinct one from another. 24. Thirdly you should know the grade of w?hidiyya, called second determination. It represents God's knowing of His Essence, Attri butes and Names in His knowledge, all these as separate entities. For all the intelligibles are predetermined in the knowledge of God. 25. There is no need to speak at greater length of w?hidiyya, as here (all) being has acquired its predestined form. Not a single intel ligible can be substituted by another. The decree of the Lord at the grade of w?hidiyya is conformable to (the predispositions at) the grade of wahda, since at this grade the intelligibles were predetermined by God. 50. All these grades come together at the grade of Man; here they become manifest. He (the Perfect Man) is the irradiation of the Lord Most High, wherein the grades all together become mani fest: wahda and w?hidiyya as well as the exterior grades. His name encompasses all (Divine) names and this totality is mani fested most clearly in the Chosen Prophet. 14 The last 3 lines may also be translated: If branches and leaves were capable of speech (they would say:) You and I are identical, in so far as we are (contained in) one and the same seed. 15 A reference to Ibn al-cArab?'s well-known lines: Kunn? hur?fan caliy?tin, we were lofty letters, etc.?</page><page sequence="23">302 BOEKBESPREKINGEN.

I wonder whether here and in ? 6 the MS. really reads bahawa-sa and hamya-sa. If this should be the case, an explanation of this abbreviation would not be out of place here. Is it a scribal error, or perhaps an intermediate form between bahawa-sa-nya and bahasai One would expect bahawa-sa-nya and hanya-sa-nya; the latter form actually occurs twice in ? 6. 9 ta-ayyun-nya r. tacayyun-nya. 7 warna? r. warna. 11 wa Ii' ll?hi -mathalu'l acl? r. wa li 'll?hi 'lmathalu 'l-acl?. 1 terkelinchir r. tergelinchir. 2 Al c?lamu huwa -ll?hu r. al-c?lamu huwa 'll?hu. 9 Yuharrif?na r.
