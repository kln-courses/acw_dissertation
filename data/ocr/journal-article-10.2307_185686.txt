<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PLACE OF THE EXPERT IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY* JEROME FRANKt In their adversely critical attitude towards administrative agencies, many lawyers and judges disclose a distrust of the expert, the specialist. That distrust is curious, for the position of our profession in society rests on the fact that we ourselves are specialists. In the famous colloquy (perhaps partly apocryphal) which is said to have oc- curred about three hundred years ago between King James I and Judge Coke, the King remarked that, if "law was founded upon reason, he and others could reason as well as the judges," and Coke loftily replied that lawsuits "are not to be decided by natural reason, but by the artificial reason and judgement of the law, which law is an art that requires long study and experience before that a man can attain to the cognizance of it." The King, an intelligent amateur, was angered, for doubtless he saw that, as McIlwain observes, "if . .. the law was to be su- preme, at the same time a mystery open only to the initiated, it is clear that, if the claim of the lawyers were to be admitted, the supreme authority would be their exclusive possession." Demos, now King, sometimes echoes James' anger at the idea of a government of lawyers, not of men. Yet, within limits, Coke was justified: The "trained intuition of the judge," resulting from his education and experience, does and should give him, in his own field, an advantage over the layman. But lawyers and judges, as experts, disclose weaknesses common to all groups of specialists-weaknesses which pre- sent a democratic society with a difficult problem. For expert groups usually become cults. Generally they create closed guilds which, resenting what they consider uninformed criticism from without, often also develop something like tyranny within. The very respect which their skills win for them from the public tends to make them smugly authoritarian towards the public. The specialist group evolves its own routines which, grown semi-sacred, are guarded by its leaders against significant change. One who, within the guild, seeks to break up any of those routines, is likely to be regarded as, at least, a silly ass, or a dangerous disturber of the intellectual peace. Unless and until he receives the blessing of the guild's leaders, he will not be accorded a fair hearing. And if he does receive the blessing, in all probability he, in turn, will come to insist that his new truths are beyond question. His new ideas, supplanting the dogmas he attacked, become themselves dogmas. He now has a prestige-monopoly, a vested interest, which he will fiercely defend against other * A paper read before the Brandeis Lawyers' Society, Philadelphia, Pa., on May 14, 1944.

Yesterday's rebel, as you know, becomes, often, today's stuffed shirt. On the ways of experts, fashion serves as a powerful compulsive. The eminent judge, says Tourtoulon, sacrifices more to fashion than does his wife, however worldly she may be. For many decades, Chief Justice Marshall set the style for decisions on constitutional issues. It took an unusually strong-minded man to deviate from that fashion. Recently, Justice Holmes' views have become the vogue. But the foibles of the legal profession, while they need far more public exposure than as yet they have received, are moderately well-known. I suggest that, in order to detect the inherent weaknesses of all specialist groups, we should observe the ways of the physicists, since they are supposed to be the most dispassionate, the most objective, of experts. If we watch the physicists closely, we perceive that fashion helps to shape the very "laws of nature" which are their peculiar province. Schroedinger, the great physicist, one of the winners of the Nobel Prize, has told us that physics, at any particular time, is "dependent ... on the fashionable frame of mind of the epoch of which it is part." In support of that statement he points to the following: The natural laws of physics are based upon experiments. As, however, the number of possible experiments is almost unlimited, the relatively few experi- ments that have been actually made to date have resulted from the choices of the physicists. But those choices, says Schroedinger, are induced by non-scientific considerations. "A certain group of ideas becomes dominant at a certain junc- ture" as a reflection of "the spirit of the age." At any given moment, "in all branches of civilization, there is one general world outlook dominant and there are numerous lines of activity which are attractive because they are the fashion of the age, whether in politics or in art or in science. These also make themselves felt in the 'exact' science of physics." The physicist, as a child of his Age "cannot shuffle off his mundane coil when he enters his laboratory." The physi- cists, accordingly, conduct merely the "fashionable" experiments-those which, according to the current fashion, are interesting and important. So fashion has determined the choices which yield "the raw materials" from which "the whole texture of physical science is woven." For instance, says Schroedinger, Grimaldi, in the 17th century, conducted an experiment with light waves; his observations attracted, at that time, little or no aitention; "they were regarded as pointing to a phenomenon which had no gen- eral interest for science as such, and for the following one-hundred and fifty years no similar experiments were carried out, though this could have been done with the simplest and cheapest material." Why? Because Grimaldi's observations were not in step with Newton's theory of light which accorded with the regnant fash- ion; "thus the general interest was carried along a different path" from Grimaldi's. Only in 1927, after the fashion had changed, did physicists note Grimaldi's ex- periment. So too with the idea of evolution. It was repugnant to many early 19th century thinkers. Then, as the style of thought changed, Darwin's theory</page><page sequence="3">PLACE OF THE EXPERT IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY 5 of origins became the vogue. Recently the astronomers have applied the idea of evolution even in their field, some of them advancing the hypothesis that "the universe on the whole is not in a stationary stage, but that, at a definite time, which is relatively not very long ago, it changed from a quite different condition into a steadily expansive stage.... " Had that hypothesis been put forward in an earlier age, it "certainly would have been regarded as nonsensical." We "do not consider this hypothesis as merely empty phantasy," writes Schroedinger, "because we have grown accustomed to the evolutionary idea." I shall later criticize the Zeit Geist or Time Spirit thesis as it is usually presented and as Schroedinger presents it. But I do, within limits, acquiesce in his view that fashions are powerful. Another eminent scientist, G.N. Lewis, says that scientists often suppress some part of the evidence for new theories which they advance, because such evidence cannot be presented with the formality which the fashion of the day dictates. Sometimes, in order to satisfy the current style in ideas, a scientist even introduces irrelevant proofs of his theory. Lewis refers to Jean Ray who, in 1630, first clearly enunciated the law of conservation of mass; Lewis queries whether Ray could himself have been convinced by the arguments that he offered to the public. "This learned physician was furnishing the sort of proof which was in vogue in his day. If we accept his conclusions," says Lewis, "without accepting his demonstration, it would be a precedent which we may often follow profitably with respect to the many demonstrations which follow the fashions of our own age." As you know, Newton, in his greatest scientific endeavors, used a new mathe- matical method which he had invented-the infinitesimal calculus. He ac- quainted his close friends with this technique. But in publishing his results, he concealed that technique because he feared that its novelty would arouse opposi- tion. Instead, he laboriously translated his work into "the well-known geo- metrical methods of the ancients" which would clothe "his work in a garb which would appear less strange and uncouth to those not familiar with the new method." And he concealed it from the general public for almost twenty years. Fashion affects not merely scientific theories but the very facts whence those theories derive. A fact reflects, or results from, a human motive, interest or pur- pose, in dealing with experience. "Pure observation" or "pure description" of experience never occurs. Looking and reporting are always motivated. Obser- vation is selective, programmatic. A "descriptive statement," a so-called "statement of fact," often represents but a prediction of future experience in which the observer is interested. The very origin of the word "fact" is illuminating. It derives from a word meaning "to make" or "to do." In English, indeed, one meaning of fact is "a thing done, a deed, an act." The word "feat" comes from the same root. In part at least, men make their facts. Facts, at least partially, are human achieve- ments, inventions, human feats. We hear much talk of "hard facts." But facts are softer than they appear to the average person. Mankind, of course, does not create the totality of experi-</page><page sequence="4">6 JEROME FRANK ence. Some phases of experience are, indeed, stubborn, tough. The "objects of perception" have hard cores which are independent of human responses to those objects. Those stubbornnesses, Justice Holmes called "Can't Helps"; Barry refers to them as "coercive" or "compulsive"; and Kenneth Burke, as the "recalcitrance of the materials." These Can't Helps, of course, do not come to us in the raw, for they are transformed for us by our sense organs. As our sense organs are not of our own making, the reports of our senses constitute, for us, part of the stubbornness, of the Can't Helps. We do not, however, mechanically accept those reports. We construct many of the interpretations which we call "facts." When we speak of "brute" or "hard" facts, we mean simply those "cores" which no man makes, which all men "have to take." But, since so large a part of our facts was originally man-made and can be changed by man, it is proper to say that every fact is "subjective" in this sense-that it involves a selection made by human beings, and human beings are so constitutionally limited in their perceptions that they cannot possibly know all that is going on in the universe. Any individual man's facts are sub- jective in another sense: They must, to "become objective," be acceptable to a sufficient number of other men. "Facts" resemble "theories." For a theory, like a fact is purposively selective. Indeed, a "fact" is a "theor-y" about some fragment of experience. There occurs, as Vaihinger has made clear, a constant shifting, to and fro, between what we call "fictions," "hypotheses," "theories," "laws" and "facts." Those names are but labels for different stages in the life of an idea. That the earth is round, not flat, is now a fact. Once it was merely some man's guess or theory. It was a fact to medieval chemists that mercury and other metals could be converted iInto gold; later, new evidence discredited that fact; in the 19th century it was a scientific fact that no chemical element could be transmuted into another; but today that is no longer a scientific fact. I must digress for a moment. Disputations about "subjectivity" and "ob- jectivity" are never-ending. I cannot here discuss that subject at length, but I make these tentative and elliptical suggestions: Man encounters at least five kinds of "subjectivities": (1) Those which inhere in the finite, limited capacities of all men. (2) Those which derive from the unique ("private") attitudes of individual persons. (3) Those which stem from the grammatical structures of particular languages. (4) Those due to the divers social heritages of social groups. (5) Those arising from location (Russell calls them "physical" sub- jectivities). The first are hopelessly ineradicable; the second are but partly surmountable; the third and fourth (which are related) can be overcome to some extent,- but probably not entirely; the fifth, in part, have been successfully eliminated by modern physicists (Einstein, et al.) To acknowledge that some human "subjectivities" are inescapable does not compel the conclusion that men's way of interpreting experience lack "reality." Men are "real." They are part of "reality." At a minimum, in that sense, their interpretations of ex- perience are "real." The valid "reality" of those interpretations includes human "feelings," the so-called "secondary qualities," and human values and ideals.</page><page sequence="5">PLACE OF THE EXPERT IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY 7 Many of the "objective" facts of the past are today considered illusions or superstitions. Without doubt, many of our facts and scientific laws will some day cease to be "objective" and will be regarded as illusions. Just as what we now consider falsities were once taken as true, so some of our truths will, in the future, be transformed into falsities. So in the familiar case of witchcraft. In 1484, when Pope Innocent VIII issued a Bull on that subject, and in 1486, when, with his approval, the famous Witch Hammer was published, witchcraft constituted a fact. To doubt the reality of witches was then both a heresy and a crime punishable by the civil arm. Certain kinds of conduct "proved" that a man or woman was a witch. Such evidence no longer convinces most of us. It is now the fashion that conduct once accepted as proof of demoniacal possession "proves" the existence of a neurosis or psychosis. The intellectuals have created the fashion of speaking of the dominance of cer- tain ideas in any given period as the Zeit Geist or Time Spirit. Recently they have made it the fashion to substitute for the Time Spirit, the now hackneyed phrase "the climate of opinion." The very history of that phrase is illuminating. It was coined by a remarkable 17th century sceptic, Joseph Glanvill, who wrote a treatise, The Vanity of Dogmatizing, in which he analyzed what today we call stereotypes-the preconceptions that distort human judgements. He urged, as the first condition of knowledge, a total abnegation of opinions received by education. And yet, himself influenced by the "climate of opinion" in which he lived, he later published a spirited defense of the belief in witchcraft. Facts, then, insofar as they are interpretations of experience, are not immortal. They are made by mortals and may be changed by other mortals. Because a fact represents a selection, embodying an attitude or motive, it follows that in the contriving of every fact some aspects of experience have been suppressed or disregarded. Someone may, some day, bob up with what was disregarded and, liberating the suppressed material, may remake (refashion) any fact. Undeni- ably, there are fashions in facts and in approaches to facts. Interestingly enough, the word "fact" is the parent of the word "faction." We should perhaps, therefore, not be too surprised to discover factional- partisan-attitudes towards facts. One faction finds repugnant the notion I have been discussing-that there is a human element in the making of facts, theories, and scientific "laws." That repugnance carries that faction to great lengths. They even refuse to recognize that many human laws for the govern- ance of a society-legal rules-are made by the human beings called judges. When a judge decides a case according to a new legal rule which he announces and, when, in so doing, he overrules a former "precedent," this faction objects to saying that the abandoned legal rule was once the "law" and has now been changed. They insist that it never was the "law," but was merely a mistaken version of it; that the "Law" is eternal, immutable, and pre-exists all man-made formulations of it; that it is merely discovered by judges as Columbus discovered America; that a judge no more "makes law" than Columbus made or invented America; that an abandoned legal rule was a false map of the "Law," resembling a pre-Columbian map of the world.</page><page sequence="6">8 JEROME FRANK Bell notes a similar attitude in some mathematicians: Some say, "We can choose a number less than n and greater than n-z," but others say, "There exists such a number." The "we can choose" men, remarks Bell, recognize the crea- tive human factor in mathematics, while the "there exists" men believe that "eve" come upon the "eternal truths" of mathematics in our journey through life. When the physicist Boltzman concluded a lecture on molecules, the sagacious Mach said, "You don't know that molecules exist," to which Boltzman replied, "I know that there are molecules." It is sometimes said, however, that such things as molecules are "theories," not "facts," and that disagreements about theories must be distinguished from differences about facts. Thus Jevons, in a well-known passage, said that "false facts in science . . . are more mischievous than false theories, since . . . a false theory is open to every one's criticism, and is ever liable to be judged by its ac- cordance with the facts," while "a false or grossly erroneous assertion of a fact often stands in the way of science for a long time because it may be extremely difficult ... to prove the falsity of what has once been recorded." There is much truth in that comment; but it ignores the point that facts embody theories, that the observer does not blindly gather facts but selects them for a purpose, and that his theory, which guides his selection, tends to lead him to overlook matters which will frustrate his theory. The case of Darwin is illustrative. When at work gathering material bearinlg on his theory of natural selection, he made an unusually conscientious effort to note everything discrepant with that theory. Yet, although he and Mendel experimented with the same species of plants, Darwin, intent on his own hypothesis, overlooked those implications of what he observed which impressed Mendel, who had a different hypothesis. As a consequence, Darwin often failed to record "data" in which Mendel constructed his theory, a theory which scientists regard as importantly modifying Darwin's. Thus Darwin's "false" theory produced "false" facts. Another illustration: Some Protestant sociologists, collecting statistics about persons in a certain country, reported that Catholics in prison greatly outnumbered Protestants. From these facts they inferred a peculiar Catholic proclivity to crime. A later investigation, however, disclosed this flaw in the "data": Many Protestant prisoners, wishing to vary their monotonous diet, had registered as Catholics in order to obtain fish on Friday. Such instances suggest that many accepted scientific "facts" concerning physical as well as human nature derive from prej- udiced theories. Let us not be deceived by the apparent "dispassionateness" of science. True, science seems singularly free of human frailities. Someone has said, "The true man of science worships but one god-truth. He despises the ecclesiastic for teaching half-truths for the sake of moral influence; the politician for dressing up truth in a partisan guise; and the businessman for subordinating truth to personal gain." But "candid camera shots" of scientists spoil that impression of serene selfless "objectivity." Bell, writing of the lives of the great mathematicians, says that there has been among them "enough dishonesty to discount the super- stitution that the pursuit of truth necessarily makes a man truthful," that envy</page><page sequence="7">PLACE OF THE EXPERT IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY 9 is frequently present in scientific undertakings, that "narrow nationalisms and international jealousies, even in impersonal pure mathematics, have marred the history of discovery and invention to such an extent that it is almost impossible in some important instances to get at the facts or to form a just estimate of the significance of a particular man's work for modern thought." Newton, early in the 18th century, lent himself to a disgracefully dishonest camlpaign to prove that Leibnitz, his great German contemporary, had stolen from him the idea of the calculus which, in fact, Leibnitz had independently invented. The ensuing international feud largely cut English mathematicians off from contact with con- tinental mathematicians for ahnost a century, during which the latter forged far ahead-to the grave disadvantage of English science. Dalton, the early 19th century English chemist, became bitterly jealous when the Frenchman Guy- Lussac, confirmed Dalton's theory, and when the Swede, Berbelius, improved the Daltonian techniques. Joule and Helmholtz, outstanding scientists, for years jealously refused to recognize Robert Mayer as the pioneer in forrmulating the modern theory of heat and of the conservation of energy, and themselves claimed priority until Tyndal compelled acknowledgment of Mayer's claims. Where, asks Trattman, "is that marvelous abstraction the 'true man of science'? Science is part of the universal biography of man and shares too often, alas, the crude anthropomorphism of his life. How else can onie account for the petty hostility of Helnholtz, who sat in the seats of the mighty .. . begrudging Mayer recog- nition." Occasionally, an unusually candid scientist tells tales out of school of how "facts" may be fudged in order to preserve "true" scientific doctrine. "I have heard," said William James, "of the lecturer on physics who had taken over the apparatus of the previous incumbent consulting him about a certain machine intended to show that, however the peripheral parts of it might be agitated, its center of gravity remained immovable. 'Well,' said the predecessor apolo- getically, 'whenever I used the machine, I found it advisable to drive a nail through the center of gravity.' " And James related that, when himself a young instructor, he was assisting a lecturer on the physiology of the heart. The lec- turer employed a turtle's heart, supporting an index-straw which threw a greatly enlarged moving shadow upon a screen while the heart pulsated. To James' consternation, the turtle's heart refused to function according to the lecturer's prediction. "There was no time for deliberation," James continues, "so with my forefinger under a part of the straw that cast no shadow, I found myself im- pulsively and automatically imitating the rhythmical movements which my col- leagues had prophesied the heart would undergo. I kept the experiment from failing, . . . and established in the audience the true view of the subject." Such deliberate deceptions in the interest "of the larger truth" will be regarded as dishonest by many scientists. But what of the observations and queries of scientists which they shove to one side and conceal as not compatible with the current fashions in science? Peirce spoke of the "moral terrorism" of respectable ideas which constrain the non-conformist who has a tabooed belief; "the greatest intellectual benefactors of mankind have never dared, and dare not now, utter</page><page sequence="8">10 JEROME FRANK the whole truth of their thought," Peirce said. "Singularly enough, the perse- cution does not all come from wvithout; but a man torments himself and is often- times most distressed at finding himself believing propositions which he has been brought up to regard with aversion," and "finds it hard to resist the temptation to submit his opinions to authority." The pressure of reputability in ideas is immense. For that reason, the scientist often suppresses the ideas, unpopular with his fellow-scientists, which have occurred to him, or the all-too-human mental processes by which he arrived at his published theories. Planck, the great physicist, writes that it would be interesting to try to discover the combinations of thoughts to which significant scientific hypotheses owed their origin, but that the task is difficult, "because, generally speaking, creative master minds have felt a personal aversion to the idea of unfolding before the public gaze the delicate threads of thought out of which their productive hypo- theses were woven, and the myriad other threads which failed to be interwoven into any final pattern." We mnay surmise that, if there were no such aversion, some quaint conceits would be unfolded before the public gaze. We have learned of a few. Buchanan notes that Descartes was directed by an angel to work out analytic geometry, Kepler was fascinated by stn worship, Faraday transferred a religious symbol to the magnetic field, Newton shot imaginary cannon-balls around the earth to rival the moon, "and the idea of the carbon ring came out of the lurid imagery of a morning after a party." The nabobs of the scientific group may easily frighten into silence the young scientist who has a fresh idea, or who has made a novel observation of "facts," prompted by some unorthodox stimulus and out of step with accepted scientific thinking. Conformity is easy, and if the young scientist is not robust, he may, for fear of ridicule, fall in line with the reputable scientific thought-ways. Those thought-ways then strait-jacket him. Kepler spent almost his entire life freeing himself from the traditional idea that a circle was the only possible orbit for a planet. No one knows how many fruitful ideas and observations of "facts" have been suppressed for fear of giving offense to the noted men of science. The con- cepts precious to the high-priests of science are likely to escape outspoken criticism and, absent that criticism, may long act as contraceptives to seminal notions. Truth crushed to earth may be prostrate for decades, even centuries. When an Einstein pontificates that the idea of "such a thing as free will in nature" is "of course preposterous," few scientists except a Nobel Prize winner like a Schroedinger or a Langmuir have the hardihood to express a belief in it. Many a theory, later to be discarded, has remained "true" for decades because the scientific pontiffs were ready to shout "preposterous" at those who opposed it. Sometimes a courageous young man breaks up some of the dogmas of the scien- tific elders. That is precisely what Einstein himself, when a youngster, suc- ceeded in doing; he dared to attack the accepted gravitation theory of Newton. Fortunately for Einstein-and for the advance of "science"-a few eminent older scientists refused to join in the general "scientific" sneers at his theory and gave him a hearing.</page><page sequence="9">PLACE OF THE EXPERT IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY 11 Of course, I amn not denying the existence of the "external world." I am (merely!) asserting that man cannot ever be aware of all its aspects. But we humans are reluctant so to admit. Men, confronted with a puzzling universe, about which they can obtain but a limited amount (and kind) of information, have always invented "just-so stories," some of which are more plausible or use- ful than others. But no such man-made interpretations will ever accurately describe, or cope with, all that goes on in the universe (or multiverse). Ines- capably, we are confined in our "private" human world, our sub-universe. Con- ceivably, we might be able to merge the "private" worlds of individual men, or groups of men, into a "public" human world. Perhaps some day we can thus achieve such a "public" world to this extent: that men everywhere on this planet will confront experience with the combined understanding of our ablest scientists and our wisest philosophers and poets. But it is not conceivable that we can ever rid ourselves of all our human limitations. A thoroughly "public" world, in that sense, lies beyond our power. The ultimate perfection of our capacities would still leave us provincials. The ordinary man's view of "nature" derives largely (at second-hand or third- hand) from what we call "natural science." But "natural science," what does it mean? Merely the current set of scientific theories, the current "just-so stories," which receive the approval of those scientists wvho have prestige. Those of us who are not scientists perforce accept their judgments on matters of science. The scientists concede that many of their scientific explanations of nature are sure to change, at least in some respect, as "science progresses"; most scientists, however, say or imply that the explanations now accepted by them are not only the best and most accurate available at present but also that they came about inevitably. But such a statement obscures the part that accident plays in both the birth and the acceptance of scientific theories. First there is the way in which a scientist accidentally stumbles on a ne-w fact which pokes a hole in an old theory. Let us recall a well-known instance of such a stumbling, with amazing conse- quences, which might be captioned From Frog Legs to Dynamos: Galvini, a physi- cian and anatomist, in 1780, having dissected a frog, happened to lay one of the frog's legs near the conductor of a charged electric machine; by sheer accident, his scalpel, while touching an exposed nerve in the leg, came in contact with the machine; a spark passed and the leg twitched convulsively. He thus discovered the electric current. Even Einstein (who seems to maintain that, generally, scientific progress is an inevitable, objectively determined, advance) admits that, in that one instance, "accident seemed to play ani essential role" in scientific growth. There "is no doubt," he says, "that Galvini's accidental discovery led Volta, at the end of the eighteenth century, to the construction of what is known as the voltaic battery"; and Einstein goes on to describe how the resulting experi- ments of Volta and others brought about the "discovery of the electric current" and thus the "tremendous development of electricity as a branch of science and technique." That development included not only the use of elec-tric power,</page><page sequence="10">12 JEROME FIANK which transformed our industries and our civilization, but also yielded a revolu- tion, through Maxwell's formulations, in the basic theories of physics. Accident plays a large part in science in even more profound ways, as will ap- pear from the following: Any scientific theory, in order to gain recognition among those men of science who possess prestige, must usually be no more than a minor, or relatively minor, correction of some theory which they previously recognized. A new theory is, therefore, usually linked up with an older accepted theory, for a theory wholly unrelated to the way in which the dominant scientific clique has been thinking about nature will seem so outlandish to them that they will gen- erally snub it. The theory of Ptolemy, the theory of Newton, each in its day, became an accepted way of thinking; the same is true of Einstein's "relativity" theories in our times. Each of these theories was, in its origin, a "happy thought" of a great mind, a very effective "just-so" story. Succeeding scientists grow up so accustomed to those stories that any new^ story has to be in line with the old. Einstein admits that sometimes a decision between two theories may be "more a matter of taste than of scientific conviction." The history of science shows that, often, scientific "taste" and "scientific conviction" are one and the same thing. Scientists, like other mortals, are prone to adhere to their preconceived explana- tions. They are not altogether unlike the movie director who, Stefanson tells, insisted that his Eskimo actors, in Nanook of the North, catch their fish by spearing them through the ice-a method unknown to those Eskimos, but correct in fiction and the movies. Always, says Swan, a scientific theory has in it something "artificial," some- thing not clearly understood, and a new theory usually explains what was not clearly theretofore understood by adding something else which, also, is not alto- gether understood. (Swan calls this process the "unification of ignorance.") When a new theory departs too abruptly from the old, the scientific nabobs usually damn it as "unscientific." They have certain criteria, more or less '"private," by which they judge a novel theory. Those criteria usually derive from the points of view (I would call them the "just-so stories") to which the members of the ruling clique are accustomed. They forget, says Swan, that those points of view "were themselves built up by analogy with the behavior of circumstances and things which had become familiar to them in their youth and which had become ingrained in their consciousness as natural before they reached the age at which they might question them." Words, be it noted, are potent in creating this feeling of "naturalness" or familiarity; what a scientist takes for granted in nature is in part a product of the way in which he was taught to talk about it (which, in turn, stems partly from the grammatical structure of his native language.) Here, again, accident enters: The accidents of fashion help to decide which of the scientists possess prestige. The accidents of fashion also help to decide which of these older theories are familiar to them and, accordingly, which of the ad- vances in science the prestigees will endorse. Had there been different scientific fashions in the past, a set of different scientific explanations might exist today; and those explanations might have been more accurate and effective than those</page><page sequence="11">PLACE OF THE EXPERT IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY 13 now existing. What "nature" is like, according to "natural science," is, there- fore, to no small extent a product of accident. For a suppressed idea, if it had been developed by its inventor and published, might radically have changed the structure of science. New ideas, if put to work, often proliferate, breed other ideas of value; the birth-control of ideas may, then, kill off a potentially huge family of ideas. Moseley's conception of atomic numbers is said by Millikan to be one of the most brilliant and important in the history of science. Now Mose- ley died in battle at Gallipoli in 1915 at the age of twenty-six. Suppose that he had thought his conception too daring and had secreted it. Einstein's relativity theories, Planck's quantum theory, have revolutionized physics. What if those men had never dared to make their theories public? They did dare, and their efforts created new patterns of scientific thought. Those patterns are, discern- ibly, man-made. They relate to nature and therefore constitute partial views of nature. When later modified-as of course they will be-the scientific view of nature will change. That is but another way of saying that "natural laws" and the "facts" about nature will change as new, daring and inventive men come along. So that, if Moseley, Einstein and Planck had been intimidated into suppressing their theories, our natural laws would not be what they now are. Perhaps no one else would ever have invented those theories, in which case there never would have been any such natural laws known to man. And, as such natural laws yield practical accomplishments based thereon, leading to man-made changes in the real world-machines and other means employed to alter nature- the suppression of those theories would have substantially retarded changes in nature itself. The suppression of scientific ideas through the overawing dogmas of the smugly arrogant scientific elders thus accidentally affects the very character of nature- both in mankind's knowledge of the "facts" concerning nature and in man- kind's transformations of nature. Here, then, we find one of the "scandals" of science about which most scientists preserve a hush policy: Science is an all-too- human enterprise, not an aloof, calmly detached, body of objective laws and facts. In part, it is a function of the pride and prejudice of the scientific tycoons. Science, says Cooley, is knowledge that can be established to the satisfaction of an expert group. But that group may err. For "it is with science as else- where; the premises of thought, being common to a group, escape scrutiny, and so, by the most rigorous methods, the common error may be propagated indefi- nitely. No group is a trustworthy critic of its own premises ... Scientific men are almost as eager to believe as the religious. It. . . all comes back to the ver- dict of the expert group, which is the best guide we have, but not infallible . The group disciplines its members, but who disciplines the group?" Many "professed men of science are no less partisans, propagandists, followers of fads than other people." I trust that you will not gather that I share with certain misguided persorns an antipathy to science and scientists. Science, properly exploited, is an indispens- able instrument in the quest of a decent civilization. And that civilization will not be achieved unless the "scientific spirit" is extended far beyond its present</page><page sequence="12">14 JEROME FRANK confines-extended, for instance, so far that scientists will cease to be dogmatic philosophers and will examine their own basic assumptions with a critical, scien- tific, undogmatic, non-Euclidian, eye. The danger is not, as some persons say, that science is anti-authoritarian, but that scientists may be too authoritarian, not sufficiently scientific towards science. Parenthetically, it is amusing to hear the chatter of those who, emphasizing the obvious, maintain that ideals are facts. Of course they are. When a group stubbornly sticks to an ideal, that ideal can be the hardest kind of hard fact. What is more to the point, facts are ideals; they symbolize hopes, aspirations, aims, goals. Still more important, there is nothing inherently noble about an ideal. Your ideal may be anathema to me, or mine to you. The Nazis are idealists, fiercely so. To us, their ideals are detestable, so detestable that we have been obliged to riesort to killing in order to obliterate those ideals. I hope that you will not infer that I accept uncritically the fashionable thesis of the "Spirit of the Age"-popularized by Hegel and accepted even by so wise a person as Schroedinger-with its dogmatic assertion that powerful fashions al- ways irresistibly shape the thoughts and emotional attitudes of all those who live in any given Age. I haven't time here to enlarge on my criticism of what I con- sider to be a silly thesis. Suffice it to say this: There is no one single Spirit in any Age. The Time Spirits in any period are multiple. They often strive with one another for mastery. Discrepant Spirits, however, may co-exist-at different levels. What seems to be a single, uniforn, Zeit Geist may be merely the point of view of the highly vocal men, the articulate individuals, the highbrows. Moreover, at bottom, every fashion-like every so-called "folk song"-has its origin in the thought and effort of some particlular individual. That is surely true in the field of women's apparel, their hats and clothes, a field where all too clearly fashion exerts tremendous power. Individual enterprise helps to make fashions and to destroy them, whether as to clothes or ideas. The essence of a true democracy -as distinguished from societies of the kind dear to Plato and all subsequent authoritarians-is that it encourages individuals to compete in con- triving and popularizing new fashions. In truth, modern democracy itself was once but a suggested fashion. Jefferson and Lincoln were among its creative designers. Now, if what I've said of the scientists is true, it must be even more true of other specialists. Stick-in-the-mud-ism is rife in every specialist group. As the top military clique court-martialled General Billy Mitchell, so the leading tele- phone engineers did their best to suppress the automatic telephone. The history of medicine is a story of an unending warfare of medical theology with medical heretics. There is need for something like a Sherman Anti-Trust Act in the realm of ideas. Although I have said much in criticism of inertia, I do not believe that there is any inherent virtue in mere change, that every change is praiseworthy. The new is not necessarily desirable, of course. Boredom, the tedium of the usual,</page><page sequence="13">PLACE OF THE EXPERT IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY 15 and neurotic as well as healthy-minded impulses, often account for the pressure for novelty. Laymen are often more eager for change than the specialist. They may long for change for the mere sake of change. That longing sometimes needs to be resisted. And susceptibility to change may be but a fashion. The fashion of change is more popular in America than, until recently, it was in most other countries. Now turn to another group of specialists who, although they deal with facts far "softer" than the physicists, seldom admit as much to the public. I refer to the historians. Roman augurs, engaged in hoodwinking the populace with prophecies based upon examination of animals' entrails, would, so the story runs, wink at one another. Similarly, now and again, able historians-in what may be called "off-the-record" writings, not intended for the high school or college student or for the general reader, but for other historians-have confessed to the dismaying inadequacy of their raw materials. The historian Nevins, in such an "off-the- record" book, recently said that, while some historical facts-constituting "merely the skeleton of history"-are virtually indisputable, facts of that kind are surprisingly few. "It is," he added, "only on the most limited and precise topics that a 'definitive' history is possible." No historian, he admits, can answer with any high degree of finality such questions as, for example, why Carthage entered the first Punic War, why the Roman Empire disintegrated, why General Howe did not go to the rescue of Burgoyne, why the Southern Con- federacy collapsed in 1865, why Napoleon III embarked on the Franco-Prussian War, or why President McKinley decided that America should fight Spain in 1898. One could compile a list a mile long of unanswerable questions concerning any century of Egyptian, Greek, Roman, European or American history. Many reasons exist for the inability of the historian to answer such questions. In the first place, he must depend on much dubious "data." There is much room for suspicion that many historical records, including many now regarded by most historians as authentic and accurate, may not be reliable. For instance, in the following and numerous other instances, as Nevins makes clear, historical narra- tives, once accepted as beyond question, have later proved false or misleading. Thus James Madison, the "father of the Constitution" and our fourth President, in his papers published after his death, gave detailed accounts, purporting to be notes, made contemporaneously, of the doings of the Constitutional Convention; they were accepted for many years as entirely accurate; however, Farrand has proved that long after the Convention, Madison altered those notes in imporant ways. Appleton's Cyclopedia of American Biography contains forty-seven "lives" of men who never lived; many historians relied upon those false biograph- ies during the several years before their exposure. Historians at one time re- garded as a storehouse of valuable information the famous diary of Gideon Welles, which, while a Cabinet officer, he kept during the Lincoln and Johnson adminis- tration; we now know that Welles altered his diary entries in the light of events which later occurred in order to black-en the reputations of men whom he had</page><page sequence="14">16 JEROME FRANK come to dislike. In 1873, Charles Frances Adams, at one time Lincoln's minister to England, published a book which gave a wealth of detail apparently demon- strating that the wise counsels of Seward accounted for Lincoln's success as Presi- dent; but later writings of others, thoroughly familiar with the facts, made evi- dent the inaccurate and biased character of Adams' book. In those and many other instances, falsities and inaccuracies, for a time not noted, were afterwards detected. If the errors had never been disclosed, our views of the past would have been seriously wrong. If, for example, no one had ever published contradictions of Adams' narrative, our current estimates of Lincoln would probably be incorrect. Unfortunately, concerning many an important historical incident the only dis- coverable evidence consists of the narrative of a single person. For instance, the Roman historian Suetonius, as secretary to the Emperor Hadrian, had access to important documents in the Imperial Archives when he was writing his Lives of the Twelve Caesars; he is, as to many of those documents, long ago destroyed, our sole source of information. But most historians, regarding him as a biased and careless reporter, hold that he should not be trusted. Here, then, is a dilemma: Historians must either rely on the unreliable Suetonius or acknowledge that no one can know many crucial facts of Roman history. An equally disturbing but less often recognized dilemma confronts historians when there are no data indi- cating anything, one way or the other, about the truthworthiness of the sole narrator of an event. In such circumstances, historians frequently accept his narrative as true, although, for all they know, it may be wholly false. Important facts of the past, both deeds and attitudes, may never have been written down and are therefore now unknown and unknowable. Palmerston, the English Prime Minister, said of the Schleswig-Holstein question: "Only two men really understood it. One of them is dead. I am the other, and I have for- gotten all about it." An event nowhere recorded, no matter how important it may have been, does not, of course exist for the historian. In the nature of things, there must be many thousands of such unreported events. Yet his- torians usually treat the non-existence of data about past occurrences as the equivalent of the non-existence of those occurrences; they often write their his- tories as if they know all about what happened at a particular time, although in fact no one possesses such knowledge. Is it not presumptuous for historians to suggest, as many of them do, that his- tory is or can be a science, and that there are precise "laws" of history which historians can learn and teach? The methods used by the physicist and the chemist in getting at their facts are not available to the historian. He cannot experiment with his materials or have first-hand acquaintance with them. He cannot make the Roman Legions march again or see with his own eyes what went on in seventeenth century England. The historian, admitting that he cannot employ the methods of the natural scientist, uses, he says, the scientific methods of the law courts. (God save the mark!) How scientific are the courts in their fact-finding techniques? True, a trial judge, before giving a decision in a lawsuit, must, as well as he can, ascer-</page><page sequence="15">PLACE OF THE EXPERT IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY 17 tain the facts; and, in so doing, he must, like the historian, deal with past events. The judge, in that sense, becomes a historian, for the actual events in litigation have already happened in the past, before the lawsuit began. These past occur- rences do not walk into the courtroom or reproduce themselves for the judge's inspection. All that the judge can do is to attempt to learn what actually happened-by listening to witnesses who saw or know the events and who tell their stories in his presence. They are under oath, and may go to jail if they perjure themselves, and if they are caught at it. Even so, some witnesses lie so skillfully that they are believed. Too, honest witnesses often observe the same facts in flatly contradictory ways. The unconscious prejudices of witnesses affect their testimony in remembering and narrating what they saw. No one has invented any scientific method for determining which witnesses (if any) are both truthful and accurate, or contrived any scale for "weighing" conflicting testimony. There is no such thing as a science of proof. Moreover, as there may be missing witnesses or missing papers all the pertinent evidence may not be brought out. For all these reasons, the "facts" as "found" by the judge are, at best, conjectures-guesses. (I omit mention of jury trials where guessing is notoriously loose.) The judge cannot be sure his guesses are right. (When several judges hear the same evidence, not infrequently their guesses differ.) Judicial fact-finding is far from perfect; it is, indeed, the weakest part of the judicial process. Certainly it is not "scientific" in the sense of being an exact science, and shows little sign of ever becoming so. When the historian attempts to imitate the non-scientific methods of the courts, he uses techniques which are even less adequate than theirs. Since the evidence he considers is often conflicting, his "facts" too are, for the most part, guesses- but guesses that usually have a much shakier foundation than those of the judge. The historian, let us say, desires to know what went on in the days of Oliver Cromwell, what all sorts and conditions of men were then doing, thinking, dreaming, hoping, taking for granted. The historian cannot, like a judge, order living witnesses to appear before him to testify under oath, to be examined and cross-examined. Usually, the historian's witnesses are in their graves. His evidence, therefore, consists largely of the unsworn writings of various dead men, none of whom can be interrogated. In their narratives of their times these dead men often differed among themselves. Most of them did not see or hear what they reported; most of them were-like the historians-guessers, dealers in second or third or fourth-hand information. Even as to the actual eye-witnesses and auditors of the past, how can the historian tell to what extent they were mistaken in their observations, or lying or prejudiced in their written accounts? Obviously, then, the historian, in arriving at his facts, cannot use the methods of the natural scientist, and cannot even imitate successfully the non-scientific techniques of the law courts. Many of his "facts" are uncertain guesses based on evidence which is both untrustworthy and admitedly incomplete. As to many matters he is somewhat like the boy who said he could remember all the dates of history but couldn't say what they stood for. The historian, wrote two eminent French historians, Langlois and Seignobos</page><page sequence="16">18 JEROME FRANK in an "off-the-record" book, "is in the situation of a chemist wvho should know a series of experiments only from the report of his laboratory boy ... In nearly every document the majority of the statements do not come from the author at first hand, but are reproductions of the statements of others.... The observa- tions" often "remain anonymous" so that "we are confronted with facts, ob- served we know not by whom or how, recorded we do not know when nor how. No other science accepts facts in such a condition, without possibility of verifica- tion, subject to incalculable chances of error." The historian who wants to make a science of history runs into real trouble when he undertakes to formulate the "laws" of history-that is, to state what, over long stretches of time, constituted the real causes of historic change. The facts of the past, even assuming that all of them were accurately known, are so numerous that a mere narration of them would yield no "laws." The historian is like a detective with too many clues. In his effort to contrive historical laws, he must "interpret" the facts. This he tries to do by selecting those which are "significant," ignoring the others. But what makes any particular historical fact "significant"? Merely that some historian chooses it and so labels it. The difficulty is that historians do not at all agree in their choices of the significant facts. There exists no scientific method of choice. The peculiar interests, per- sonalities and prejudices of the several historians affect their selections. The historian Pirenne openly states that every history book is a "conjectural recon- struction of the past" and that, because of the differences among historians, "history is a conjectural science, or, in other words, a subjective science." A strange "science" indeed-one which consists of numerous discrepant, preju- diced, guesses of individual historians. Nevins remarks that no important his- tory book has yet appeared which did not reveal some bias. Jameson said of Bancroft's volumes on American history that every volume voted for Andrew Jackson. Often it is said by historians that we cannot properly understand our own times, that we are too close to them, that not until the present becomes part of the past can it be adequately comprehended. So we are told that Lincoln's true significance could not be learned by men of his own day, and that the "real mean- ing" of the New Deal must await the judgment of the future. When historians talk in that manner, what do they have in mind? One suspects that sometimes they mean merely this: When things are happening, there are so maniy of them that their inter-relations are excessively complex and baffling. If, for instance, someone now could and did gather all the information at present available about the New Deal, there would be too much data; but, in future days, much of the evidence concerning the New Deal will be more manageable and an analysis of that movement will seem to be simpler-precisely because many of the important but complicated facts, now known by some persons who will not record them, will then have been forgotten and will then be undiscoverable. In other words, as a period recedes into the past, its "significance" appears to grow more obvious due to increasing ignorance of the facts of that period. That is not the historian's usual explanation. Usually it is said that, when</page><page sequence="17">PLACE OF THE EXPERT IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY 19 the present merges into the past, events will be seen in "better perspective." But whose perspective? That of men with a different viewpoint, an altered orientation, in the light of the problems of their own day. Their angle on the oc- currences we are now experiencing will be a new angle. Will that aid them the better to understand our times? Of course not. The best proof of that fact is that an era, like the so-called Middle Ages, which is many centuries in the past, has taken on differing perspectives for each succeeding century: The Middle Ages did not look the same to WValter Scott in the nineteenth century as it had to Voltaire in the 18th; it does not look the same to most of us in the twentieth century as it did to either Scott or Voltaire. And the differing perspectives are not primarily due to increases in the amount of information about the Middle Ages. They are ascribable principally to variations in the outlooks, and there- fore in the back-looks, of the lookers. To some extent, the variations flow from the fact that, as time goes on, more things happen which can be said to result from the past. In 1944, one can pur- port to trace relations between the French Revolution and the Russian Revolu- tion and Nazism-as one could not have done in 1850 or 1900 before there was a Russian Revolution and a Nazi movement. Consequently, it is possible in 1944 to give a new "significance" to the French Revolution. Every decade there is a revised version of Alexander, Julius Caesar, Charlemagne, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln-because in each decade the events of the immediately preceding decade reconstruct those historic personages. The past, in that sense, is a present fact-a present reflection of our present hopes, frustrations and despairs. The past is not, for us, what it was when it occurred; it is what we now make it. The failure to note that fact is partly due to a confusion of two meanings of the word "history": It means events as they actually happened; it also means what is said and thought about those events at a later time. In truth, it is only history according to the second meaning that makes sense when we talk of the past. The nature of history, so understood, is clarified by considering the following: Even if we now knew every precise detailed fact about a past period-say, the English Revolution of 1688-and if we passed that complete information on to posterity, that past period would constantly alter as time elapsed and as human society changed its attitudes. Whether Magna Carta was a splendid or a reac- tionairy document, whether the Northern Abolitionists were heroes or scoundrels or fools, whether Cromwell was a great man or a bloody tyrant-will time tell? Yes, it will. But what will it tell? It will tell, at any particular future time, what sort of men the tellers are. A biography, it is said, is largely the auto- biography of the writer, and so is a history. When someone says, "Here is a lesson from the past," we should ask, "Whose past? What is the character and the program of the man who is interpreting it?" It is amusing to note how easily one historian finds bias in the writings of another. Hear Macaulay on Hume's history of England: "Hume is an accom- plished advocate. Without positively asserting much more than he can prove, he gives prominence to the circumstances which support his case [the virtues of</page><page sequence="18">20 JEROME FRANK the English Tories]. He glides lightly over those unfavorable to it ... Every- thing that is offered on the other side is scrutinized with the utmost severity; every suspicious circumstance is ground for argument and invective. ..; con- cessions even are sometimes made, but this insidious candor only increases the effect of the vast mass of sophistry." Now turn to Mark Pattison's comment on Macaulay's history of England. After noting that Macaulay was a Whig statesman, he says that "in writing of the history of the rise and triumphs of the Whig principles in the latter half of the 17th century, he identified himself with the cause [of the WVhigs] . . .When he is describing the merits of friends and the faults of enemies, his pen knows no moderation . . . Macaulay's was the mind of the advocate, not of the philosopher. . . Macaulay was, as he himself said of Bishop Burnet, 'a strong party man on the right side'." No wonder, then, that even those historians who believe that precise laws of history govern mankind do not agree with one another as to what those laws are. Many of them admit how guessy their facts are. Their attitude, then, boils down to this: "We historians, through no fault of our own, are failures in adequately discovering the true facts of history. Therefore you should trust us to discover 'laws' relating to these relatively little known facts. We can't tell you much of what actually happened, but we can tell you why it happened. As to most of what occurred in the past, we are very uncertain. But we are completely certain that whatever occurred was inevitable." In the face of the insurmountable difficulties which confront them, the manner in which most historians write their histories surpasses belief. If there ever was an art calling for humility on the part of its practitioners, it is history-writing. The first sentence of almost every history-book should read, "What follows con- sists of a series of guesses most of which are based on highly doubtful evidence, so doubtful that the reader is warned to take little of this book very seriously." Seldom, however, do historians insert any such warning anywhere in their his- tory books. The value of recognizing the imperfections in our knowledge of the past is that it undermines the belief that any accounts of the allegedly "true" causes of social change are substantially trustworthy. Thus we can learn that there are dis- coverable no inexorable laws which bind our future, that usually those laws are simply interpretations which wishful thinkers have contrived. We should not, however, be snobs about the past. In its reservoir are ideas unwisely discarded, hopes and plans frustrated and abandoned, our infolmation concerning which, although inadequate, may supply us with a few valuable sug- gestions for our present and future. Thus the unity which the Roman Empire gave Europe had its evil side, but some of the values it created may well be heeded today. History, too, liberates us from the fetters of the present, for it suggests that there were other ways of doing things than those we now employ. The intelligent reading of history can and should serve as a liberator. It shows the past not as a command to us but, at most, as a reservoir from which we can draw a few of the materials we now need. Of course, we cannot completely</page><page sequence="19">PLACE OF THE EXERT IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY 21 escape the habits which the past has implanted in us. But we owe it no obliga- tions. The dead man whom we regard as great we should venerate; but we are living our lives and have no duty to live them as they lived theirs. It is to our- selves and to the future that our society owes a duty. From history we can ob- tain some hints; it will suggest a few do's and a few don't's. There is, said Mr. Justice Holmes, "a peculiar logical pleasure in making manifest the continuity between what we are doing and what has been done before. But the present has a right to govern itself so far as it can; and it ought always to be remembered that historic continuity with the past is not a duty, it is only a necessity." History is "the first step toward an enlightened scepticism, that is, towards a deliberate reconsideration of the worth" of old ways of conduct. It "encourages scepticism when one sees" how an old mode of behavior "has grown up or when one notices the naivete with which social prejudices are taken for eternal principles." If we do not ask too much of historians, and if we content ourselves with rela- tively short-range looks ahead, the annals of the past can be of some help. Thus, in 1790, Burke, in his Reflections on the Revolution in France, on the basis of his study of history, predicted that the lax relations of the French government with the French Army, would lead to the rise of a "popular general" who would be a military dictator. When Alexander Hamilton wanted to show that the loose League of thirteen independent American States-under the Articles of Con- federation-would not work, he went to history to show that such schemes of government, lacking any effective over-all sovereignty, had always failed. Despite the obstacles, some social planning for the future, guided by some knowledge of the past, is necessary, desirable and possible. Men often forget that not to plan is a kind of planning-a plan to accept whatever happens, or a plan to abide by the uncorrected results of the past when meeting the future. Precise blueprints of the future are absurd. But men can do much to control their destiny, if their efforts are cautiously tentative and their plans are executed with a weather eye constantly open for signs that factors of importance have been overlooked or that new factors are emerging which compel revisions of their plans. We should not plot a course, take our ease, and sail blithely along, sure that there is nothing we have ignored and that we need never reckon with unanticipated hurricanes, fogs or icebergs. We can, in the light of past experience-including past mistakes-see to it that our ship is as seaworthy as possible, and use the best educated guesses we are able to make as to what lies ahead. Our chief safeguard against shipwreck is a knowledge that we know little and a rejection of the cock- sure illusion that anyone can foreknow with precision all the adventures yet to be encountered. We should beware of soothsayers, no matter how erudite or self- assured; we want, not soothsayers, but careful mariners. We must not try to guide the future inflexibly. The future, when it becomes the present, is sure to bring new unanticipated problems. There is much wisdom in Valery's reference to the "anachronism of the future." Still more important, we ought not shirk the present aspects of today's problems in order to indulge in too much tinkering with tomorrow's. The future, unless we are careful, can be- come as perniciously tyrannical over us as the past. Excessive posterity-worship</page><page sequence="20">22 JEROME FRANK can be as bad as blind ancestor-worship. And sometimes what passes for devo- tion to future generations is but a desire rigidly to control posterity; too cockily we often believe that, while our forefathers' ideas are outmoded for us, ours are sure never to grow stale; we hope that we, as future ancestors, will be worshipped. Anatole France said that, as man needs to be amused by stories, we should not deprive him of history, the finest form of intellectual amusement. "I know as well as you that history is false," he wrote, "that all the historians . . . are narra- tors of fables. But that does not disturb me. I am quite willing that an Hero- dotus should deceive me in an agreeable manner; . . . I would even regret it if history were exact. I willingly say with Voltaire: reduce it to truth and you ruin it...." History, he added, is "a sort of romance designed for those who have sagacious and curious minds....." Few historians, however, hold themselves out as fictionists. Most of them purport to tell in detail exactly what actually happened. These specialists in- vite the rest of us to guide our present and future conduct by their reports of the past, to depend on what they tell, to assume that they know what they are talk- ing about. There they sin. Their pretenses of accuracy are false pretenses. A wag might suggest that, if there were some governmental agency which func- tioned with reference to historians as does the SEC with respect to sellers of stocks and bonds, most-not all-history-books would be barred from the mails on the ground that they contain seriously false and misleading information on which their purchasers are solicited to rely; and no such book could lawfully be sold unless it was labeled not "History" but "Twistory," or unless it fully had fairly disclosed that the author did not vouch for the accuracy of most of its contents. It is true that the "exact" science of physics is showing up today as far less exact than has heretofore been supposed. It might then be argued that the difference between physics, on the one hand, and the so-called "social sciences" including history, on the other, is merely one of degree. But the difference in degree is so great as to constitute a difference in kind. That does not mean that social studies are utterly useless, or that an effort should not be made to reduce their uncertainties. No one but a fool rejects the possibility of reducing uncer- tainty as far as is practicable because it cannot be completely eliminated-just as no sane man will turn his back on all physicians merely because the flesh is heir to many diseases for which no cure has been, and probably ever will be, discovered by the medical profession. Perfection is not attainable. The insane asylum is the place for the perfectionist, for those who demand complete freedom from uncertainties. We are but mortal, and contingency and uncertainty are the essence of mortality; only in the womb and the grave do we escape them. Never- theless, although history and the other so-called social sciences can become less inexact, we should never forget their peculiarly inherent uncertainty. With such an attitude, we will rescue ourselves from the two greatest human fallacies: The fallacy of deteriminism, of denying the reality of all human free- dom, of seeking irresponsibility through recourse to Nature or Providence which we expect to dictate our every move; and the opposed fallacy of arrogantly assum-</page><page sequence="21">PLACE OF THE EXPERT IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY 23 ing that mankind can ever be wholly free to guide its own course, infallibly, to perfection. We can neither escape the flux and variety of life nor our own finite- ness, The only absolute knowledge on which we can count is that human knowledge will always be relative and limited. That awareness, however, will not enable us to elude our limitations. Thus we come to the paradox of the American faith: Humility in the face of our inescapable limitations but faith that the human will can-I say can, not must-move us forward on the road to the good life. The impossibility of reaching perfection does not justify indifference to the aim of constantly bettering man's lot. Our problem vis a vis specialists is like that of the young lady to whom Shaw's Bishop said that she would be making a mistake if she married but a worse mis- take if she didn't. We must have specialists. But we must democratize them. We must see to it that they do not, in an authoritarian manner, repel novelties. We must, too, subject the experts to constant' criticism by the laity. We must, therefore, demand that the experts translate their esoteric formulations into terms easily comprehensible by non-experts. (Incidentally, I more than suspect that such translation will often bring to the experts themselves a nicer understanding of their own formulations.) Take, for instance, the cult of experts, or specialists, to which, at least titu- larly, I belong. Seagle, in his recent book, The Quest for Law, has described at length (with perhaps excessive hostility) the inertia-loving ways of lawyers and their devotion to needless mystery-mongering about matters legal. Certainly most judges have not sufficiently acquainted the public with the methods by which they arrive at their decisions. They have inadequately revealed to non- lawyers-indeed, often even to lawyers-the true springs of their actions. Moreover, encouraged by most lawyers, many judges wall off their routines from desirable innovations. In particular, they have been backward and inefficient in what I regard as the most important part of their work-the ascertainment of the past facts on which specific judicial decisions turn. The law schools devote most of their time to improving legal rules and modes of using such rules. Such improvement is possible and needed. But court-house finding of facts has been of little interest to the experts in legal education. I do not refer to those "background" facts- concerning economics and other social problems-which the famous "Brandeis briefs" illuminated. Today, most American courts welcome light on such prob- lems. I refer, rather, to the inefficient judicial techniques for learning, so far as it is practical to do so (it is often impossible to do so completely), the actual past facts of the specific controversies which come before the courts for decision. In part, the immense growth of Commissions, administrative agencies, was a response to that judicial deficiency. Having been a member of such a Commis- sion and being now a member of the judiciary, I say with some considerable assurance, that many Commissions are far better equipped for that kind of fact- finding than are most courts today. Largely unobserved by students of government, there began, in 1938, a novelty</page><page sequence="22">24 JEROME FRANK in so-called "administrative law." I have in mind the manner in which the SEC now functions in a case of corporate reorganization. The Commission does not first pass on such a case which is then appealed to and reviewed by a court largely bound by the Commission's findings of fact. On the contrary, the case, at every stage, is conducted by the judge. The SEC serves merely as the judge's assistant. Using its staff of experts-engineers, accountants and the like-the Commission gathers a multitude of data concerning the case and presents that data to the judge. Other parties are free to dispute the evidence presented by the SEC, and the judge is free to deal with the SEC's evidence, in the traditional judicial manner, in reaching his decision. But the court, with the aid of persons who specialize in a certain kind of fact-gathering, is thus far better able than it otherwise would be to approximate the facts and arrive at a fairly just conclusion. I suggest that here is an importantly new departure, one which preserves the essential judicial techniques but introduces expertness where it is most needed in the judicial process. I believe that, had that device been invented fifty years ago, we would not have had the vast growth of that sort of administrative ac- tivity which has given rise to much recent irmtation and angry discussion. That new technique is capable of extensive application in the work of the courts. Its great virtue is that it tends to diminish the routineering and eso- tericism to which all expert groups are susceptible. It discloses one effective way of democratizing experts. In closing, I call your attention to the fact that the present majority of the United States Supreme Court is bent on democratizing the judiciary. In the Bridges case, it denied to a judge the power to jail his critics for contempt of court unless those critics caused an actual disturbance in the courtroom. That decision went far to dissipate the legend that there is a divinity that doth hedge a judge. Moreover, the present majority of the Supreme Court has been franker with -the public than its predecessors. While from its earliest days the Supreme Court has, on many occasions, explicitly overruled some of its former decisions, the usual practice was to kill off precedents by indirection. The Court would usually not say, "Our decision in Black v. White was wrong," but would declare, "The Black-White decision has been misunderstood. It applies only to the peculiar facts of that case," those facts being so idiosyncratic that never again would that decision serve as a guide. To use lawyers' jargon, precedents were thus "dis- tinguished." But in thus "distinguishing" them, the Court, in truth, "extin- guished" them-without saying so. Today the Supreme Court is more candid, more frequently lets the public in on what it is doing. It now freely confesses that judges are human-and therefore fallible. Let other experts go and do likewise.</page></plain_text>
