<plain_text><page sequence="1">This essay reads the decomposition of the human corpse in Jim Crace's novel Being Dead as an expression of active, vital, agential, and transformative inter-species interaction. Affirming the creative possibilities of putre- faction, my analysis of Crace's necro-ecological narrative emphasizes the vitality of death through the entan- gled interactions of organisms both human and non-human, living and dead.

The consortium of species that congregate within and surround the dead bodies of Joseph and Celice enact a vital, animate process of inter- species participation and community that I define in this essay as a "necro-ecology." Advancing a post-mortem theory of being that interprets the life-death distinction through the vitalism of Gilles Deleuze (which views life as a vital continuum), I argue that Crace's necro-ecological narrative continually affirms the organic relations of decomposition as a radical mode or condition of being that extends beyond the moment of death itself. This approach utilizes the interactionist ontology of New Mosaic 48/3 0027- 1276-07/ 19 10 18$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">192 Mosaic 48/3 (September 2015) Materialist scholarship and Karen Baraďs concept of "agential realism" to analyze how an ecology of decomposition fortifies a new world of non-human material agency that challenges the humanist schema of life and death. In conceiving of this post-mortem literary landscape, Crace's necro-ecological narrative views being in the world as infinite and agential, which in turn creates possibilities for thinking and nar- rating beyond what Jacques Derrida describes as the "aporia" of death. Imagining what is impossible to think, Being Dead explores the capacity of the corpse to produce alternative ways of knowing (and unknowing) what it means to be dead. In essay taking diverges on a vitalist from the approach framework to the of life-death finitude that distinction grounds in much Crace's of intellectual novel, this essay diverges from the framework of finitude that grounds much of intellectual thought on the subject of human and animal death. This framework has been used for several purposes. A host of animal studies scholars from James Stanescu to Chloë Taylor and J.M. Coetzee, for instance, depend on a framework of finitude in order to advance a responsible and compassionate ethical paradigm that responds to the biopolitical (or thanatopolitical) state's violent and systematic slaughter of human, and especially non-human, animals. Other approaches to human and animal death - notably Derrida's The Animal That Therefore I Am and Cary Wolfe's critique of "dou- ble finitude" - emphasize the shared corporeal vulnerability and mortality of the human and animal, and in particular the human's own subjection to the "materiality and technicity of language that is always on the scene before we are, as a radically human precondition for our subjectivity" (Wolfe, "Human" 571). While these cri- tiques make a valuable contribution to thinking through notions of grievability, eth- ical responsibility, and suffering, the framework of finitude nevertheless produces a number of problems. First, finitude depends on the notion that the subject is subjected to external (if not also malevolent) forces, which implies that life itself is ultimately weak, vulnerable, and easily assailable. Even further, finitude maintains a sharp divi- sion of the living from the dead as it interprets death as the definitive end of being. Thus embedded in a negative structure of loss, mourning, difference, and vulnerabil- ity, the subjected subject of the framework of finitude views life as finite, with death as the final terminus. Examinations of Deleuze's vitalist philosophy, including those undertaken by Rosi Braidotti and Claire Colebrook, articulate how this negative conception of life comes to bear upon our understanding of subjectivity and being. Colebrook main- tains, for example, that Judith Butler's "widely influential account of subjectivity as subjection" ( Deleuze 109) places the bounded organism in a "relation of negation" through its submission to the heterosexual matrix (110). This negative relation is also</page><page sequence="3">Sarah Bezan 193 present in Derridean deconstruction, Colebrook further argues, due to its negative emphasis on reiteration and repetition, which arises from the notion that death haunts or infects life (47). Similarly, Braidotti contends that from Giorgio Agamben's biopo- litical conception of bare life to Jacques Lacan's notion of the prediscursive, the chora of Julia Kristeva, and the maternal feminine of Luce Irigaray, there is an indication of the "captured subject" who is always already ensnared in a logic of difference, other- ness, and lack ("Politics" 211). Bare life in particular, Braidotti insists, is "not genera- tive vitality, but rather the constitutive vulnerability of the human subject, which sovereign power can kill" ( Posthuman 120). By taking mortality or finitude as the basis of subjectivity, Braidotti argues, Agamben's biopolitical paradigm re-articulates the Heidegger ian theory of being which "deriv[es] its force from the annihilation of ani- mal life," and in turn "fuels an affective political economy of loss and melancholia at the heart of the subject" (120-21). Outlining the effects of the limited, disempowered subject of psychoanalytic, deconstructionist, feminist, and biopolitical paradigms, Colebrook and Braidotti suggest that a vitalist approach to life and to subjectivity affirms the potential of the organism to generate new ways of being and becoming in the world. In opposition to the framework of finitude, Deleuze's vitalist philosophy exam- ines how life creates infinite possibilities for the subject s unobstructed becoming in the world, and challenges the assumption that death is "the teleological destination of life" (Braidotti, Nomadic 343). As another stage in the organisms transformation, life according to Deleuze is not the property of a singular being, but a relendess and diver- sifying principle that flows both within, and beyond, the bounds of the organism as pure excess and potentiality. Affirming the capacity of the subject to counter-actualize, or push back against, the powers of external forces (Colebrook, Deleuze 14), a life phi- losophy thinks through death not merely as a loss, but as a moment for reconstitu- tion and transformation as the subject enters into new assemblages, couplings, and participations. In fact, for Deleuze's vitalism, the "death of the self clears the way for a new, still unlived, and unlivable living," according to Peter Hallward (92). As Deleuze insists in Pure Immanence , life does not end "when individual life confronts universal death" but is rather "everywhere, in all the moments that a given living sub- ject goes through" (29). Understanding death as impersonal, as per Alain Badiou's treatment of Deleuze's life philosophy, means that death is both intimately related and absolutely exterior to the individual (13). For it is death, Deleuze writes, that "indicates the moment when I disappear outside of myself [. . .] [and] when death loses itself in itself" ( Logic 153). Therefore, in thinking outside the bounds of the individual's death, vitalism sees the world as enmeshed with the organism (and vice versa), and</page><page sequence="4">194 Mosaic 48/3 (September 2015) suggests that this embeddedness of the organism in the world occurs on a register beyond the conceptions of time and duration that would normally adhere to the indi- vidual subject. Co-constituted from within and without, the subject's relation to death in Deleuze's vitalist philosophy demonstrates its enclosure within (contra fini- tude's exposure to) the world. Moreover, in viewing life as the power to differ (Colebrook, Introduction 5), vital- ism explores the subject's capacity to rupture structures of knowledge through radical becoming. As Tasmin Lorraine suggests, human life for Deleuze is "organized into strata which are implicated with nonhuman strata of life. Nomadic subjects can destratify from rigid forms of organization by creating 'planes of consistency' that put heteroge- neous elements of existence into continuous variation" (5). The nomadic subject's dynamic movement and destratification of non-human and human strata works toward a radical immanence, which, as Eugene Thacker explains, is "neither a quality that a body has, nor a vital force separate from a thing that is vitalized, but the priority of imma- nence itself, a continuum or network of affects in which individuated subjects are more effects than causes" (Life xii-xiv). Put another way, immanence affirms the capacity of the subject to deconstruct and variate structures of difference through becoming. The potential of a vitalist philosophy to break down these structures of difference (namely, between the human and non-human animal) has important implications. From Descartes to Heidegger, the non-human animal in particular has been deemed perishable and declared as lacking access to death "as such," as Akira Lippit articulates in Electric Animal Stationed as an "excess" to the ontology of the human (51 ), the ani- mal also retains a tenuous relationship with life. Braidotti convincingly argues that "life is half animal, zoē [. . .] and half discursive, bios" with zoē positioned as "the poor half of [the] couple" through its associations with gritty materiality, otherness, and inhumanity ("Politics" 207). But while much of philosophical thought on the animal, according to Lippit, considers the animal as " undeadF and in a state of "perpetual van- ishing ' ( 1 , emph. mine) , life or zoē for Deleuze creates a "generative vitality" that oper- ates as a "transversal force that cuts across and connects previously segregated domains" (Braidotti, "Animals" 530). By engendering dynamic inter-species connec- tions and relations, the philosophy of vitalism dismantles the division that separates the human and non-human animal and, with it, challenges the life-death distinction that runs parallel to it. Therefore, to deconstruct the life/non-life binary, or what Mel Chen calls the "fragile division between animate and inanimate - that is, beyond human and animal" (2), is to disrupt the maintenance of this coextensive boundary and to produce a more fulsome view of life's potential to disassemble structures that perpetuate differences or essences between organisms both living and dead.</page><page sequence="5">Sarah Bezan 195 With a view to collapsing the human/animal divide and the life-death distinc- tion, my interpretation of Deleuze's vitalism through death and decay creates a new and open set of relations with the world and its human and non-human inhabitants. Understanding this set of relations as a necro-ecology, I argue that a vitalism of decomposition identifies an alliance of organisms that is made possible by and through death , as opposed to a community split between the living and the dead. This vitalist philosophy (with its particular emphasis on putrefaction) proceeds from Deleuze, but it charts new theoretical territory in that it pays particular attention to decomposition as a generative stage in the life process and regards the corpse in particular as a site of continuous becoming and agential activity. The foundation of this vitalist philosophy of decay can be found in Thacker's review of the life-death distinction in After Life , wherein he identifies nineteenth-century German biology as the precursor to biological vitalism, which sees life as infinite. Thacker writes that despite the life and death of "the discrete living organism," biolog- ical vitalism views life as "a continuum that conditions the possibility of the living." Through its associations with "death, decay, and decomposition," which has its roots in the gothic genre (26), biological vitalism takes an organicist approach to death, observ- ing putrefaction to be a component of "a new kind of composition" (255). My consid- eration of a vitalist philosophy of decay also finds its basis in biophilosophy, which Thacker elsewhere calls the "critique of all anthropomorphic conceptions of life" and an "approach to nonhuman life, nonorganic life, anonymous life, indefinite life - what Deleuze calls 'a life'" ("Biophilosophy"). In analyzing how putrefaction induces new compositions, relations, and alternative modes of being in the world, a vitalism of decomposition therefore explores the ways in which death occasions an active necro- ecological web of inter-species belonging and connection. This decompositional vital- ism initiates an inquiry into how the corpse can rupture notions of the human and non-human, material and immaterial, and active and passive that anchor philosophi- cal considerations of being, and furthermore investigates how a reading of the post- mortem can initiate ways of thinking through the "world" not as divided, but as intimately connected to entities both living and dead, human and non-human. The of communication dead body in continental and spirit, philosophy and in an is abhorrent widely regarded state of as decay inert, as passive, it transfigures, devoid of communication and spirit, and in an abhorrent state of decay as it transfigures, horrifyingly, into something other than human. In its " transition to a nonhuman form of reality ; whether [by] physical corruption or metaphysical transcendence " (2, emph. Ireton's), the corpse in the history of the philosophy of death indicates a clear chal- lenge to notions of humanity, materiality, and activity. But in Crace's novel, being</page><page sequence="6">196 Mosaic 48/3 (September 2015) dead inaugurates a new mode of being through "intra-action" (to use Barads term), which in turn produces a vital, post-mortem narration. While modernist literary treat- ments of death would relegate the corpse to the outer limits of narrative and portray the horror of the dead through a breakdown of language, stream of consciousness narra- tion, and the fragmentation of the subject, Being Dead situates Joseph and Celice front and centre as it provides a stable account of their decay through a third-person omnis- cient narrative. As Crace's novel reveals, Joseph and Celice do not cease to be active, agential, vital, and subjective as they rot away on the beach. In a series of encounters with non-human organisms, their bodies "intra-act" and become subjective-objective participants in the story of their own decay. It is incumbent here to note that Being Dead is not a crime novel, nor is it a mys- terious whodunit that pursues the capture of a murderer. Crace's narrative also does not align with modernist and postmodernist "burial plot" fictions or with the decom- posing, fragmenting protagonist(s) of modernist literature (such as that found in Samuel Beckett's trilogy of novels, Molloy, Mahne Dies, and The Unnamable). While Lisa Perdigão argues that "burial plot" fictions regard dead bodies as "sites of crisis for narrative transaction" (1) that drive either the internment of the body (as in mod- ernism) (13) or the exhumation of the body (as in postmodernism) (17), Crace's nar- rative considers the corpse to be a dramatic site of activity for a natural burial undertaken by the earth and its agents. Opposing the idea that to be human is to bury, or that " Dasein does not die until its remains are disposed of (143, emph. Harrison's), and contrary to the proclivity of Western culture to sanitize or hide death, Being Dead emphatically meditates on the reality of death and decay. Moreover, in its close med- itation on Joseph and Celice's bodily decomposition, Crace's novel challenges what David Sherman calls modernism's discourse of "profound mourning" (5) and resists the view that the corpse is uncanny, abject waste, or a ghastly threshold of self and other. Although the narrative describes the process by which Joseph and Celice's daughter tracks down their bodies and grieves their deaths, there is no funeral, wake, eulogy, or " quivering ' (the term Crace fabricates to describe a mourning ritual): instead, all that remains are the multiple connections and encounters Joseph and Celice make by being dead. But what is the value of depicting these encounters, and of exploring what a corpse can do? To answer this question, we turn to Deleuze, who imagines what a body can do (following Spinoza). While he never fully investigates what a dead body can do, Deleuze does write that when the body dies, "its parts are so disposed that they acquire a different relation of motion and rest" ( Spinoza 32, emph. Deleuze's). Following this critique, what kinds of speeds and slownesses, latitudes and longitudes</page><page sequence="7">Sarah Bezan 197 (or degrees of intensity), and assemblages can the material dead body of Being Dead create and enact? And how can these relations challenge what we understand to be human and what it means to be a material agent in the world? To consider what a dead body can do, we begin with the first scene of death in Crace's novel. Returning to the site of their first intimate encounter on the sand dunes nearly thirty years prior, neither Joseph nor Celice could imagine their murder, nor conceive of the transformations their bodies would undertake during their week of decay on the beach. Following the blows to their skulls dealt by an opportunist robber, Celice expires in less than a minute. However, her clinical death - the failure of her lungs and heart and brain - initiates another wave of activity: "There were still battles to be fought but these would be post mortem , the soundless, inert wars of chemicals contesting for her trenches and her bastions amid the debris of exploded cells. Calcium and water usurped the place of blood and oxygen so that her defunct brain, almost at once, began to swell and tear its canopies, spilling all its saps and liquors, all its stored immersions of passion, memory and will, on to her scarf, her jacket and the grass" (10). Joseph is fatally injured but outlives Celice "by more than half an hour," his kidneys still processing cells, his stomach digesting what remains of the mango and cheese brioche that had been his breakfast (11). While the bodies of Joseph and Celice are depicted as vulnerable flesh, laying undignified and without "the power not to die" (14), they are nevertheless "not departed" (15) and "still producing energy" as they become food for an assembly of necrophagous organisms ( 101-02). It is the post-mortem action of their bodies - what their corpses do - that carries Crace's narrative forward. Celice's post-mortem "battles" indicate the beginning of autolysis, in which the "inert wars of chemicals contesting for her trenches" is understood as the intrinsic breakdown of the body at its own directive. Scientific research on the decaying human corpse describes this process as the result of "the release of enzymes from the lyso- somes (subcellular organelles that contain digestive enzymes) thereby causing cells to digest themselves and chemicals, such as stomach acids, from the dead cells and tis- sues" (Gunn 22). Although her brain is "pale and mushy as a honeycomb" (Crace 10), Celice's body is immersed in an intensive process of self-decomposition. This decom- positional energy can be understood in light of Deleuze's explanation of the body's degrees of intensity. For instance, Deleuze suggests that "we call longitude of a body the set of relations of speed and slowness, of motion and rest, [. . .] between unformed elements ," whereas we understand latitude as "the set of affects that occupy a body at each moment" through the "intensive states of an anonymous force " ( Spinoza 127 , emph. Deleuze's). To understand corporeal decomposition as a degree of intensity, we might see the cellular components of Celice's body as the elements of her decay, with</page><page sequence="8">198 Mosaic 48/3 (September 2015) her body itself positioned in a longitudinal relation as horizontal, slow, and moving at an almost imperceptible speed, but at an intensity of variable cellular action, recon- stitution, and relation. It is helpful to make sense of this difference in degree by comparing Celice's corpse to the composition of her body as a living, breathing zoologist. Celice's early work on the "oceanic bladder fly" and later job as a part-time biology tutor at a uni- versity orients her in a vertical position, bearing down on the earth and non-human species from a seemingly superior point of view. In her annual fieldwork lecture, Celice views the "slides of putrefying seals or tide-abandoned fish" (40) as objects of knowledge, and the world as a "reassuring microcosm" that she can submit "to the magnifier" (75). This particular set of relations between the non-human world and Celice's body are apparent as she collects her data, sets a Latin name to the flora and fauna she discovers by the sea, orients herself as an expert in her field, and accounts for her own lofty station in "the natural orders of zoology" (86). But as the dead bod- ies of Joseph and Celice mortify, this particular degree of intensity shifts, where it is they who are "passed down, through classes, orders, species, to the last in line, the lumpen multitude, the loopers and the millipedes, the button lice, the tubal worms and flets, the bon viveur or nectar bugs, which had either too many legs or none" (101). It is through this intensive relation of composition and decomposition that these two doctors of zoology enact the potential of the body. For if life according to Deleuze is "a complex relation between differential velocities, between deceleration and acceleration of particles" ( Spinoza 124), then the vitalism of decomposition cre- ates a dynamic degree of intensity with its own set of speeds and reactions that make becoming - even in death - possible. Moreover, in moving away from a hierarchy of taxonomie difference upheld by natural science, Joseph and Celice's dead bodies rad- ically deviate from "questions of essences and towards those of relations or composi- tions with other powers, notably powers of the trans-human" (Larson 84). Shifting from a treatment of the non-human animal as a source of knowledge, Joseph and Celice's deaths enable them to enter into a heightened, entangled state of relations with the non-human world outside of the bounds of natural scientific prac- tice. Understood in relation to Barad's notion of "agential realism," the decomposition of Joseph and Celice challenges the organized structure of human and non-human animal difference upon which they relied in life. As we learn from Barad, "agential realism" is an approach to the collapse of the ontological boundary between observer and observed phenomena in favour of an outlook that affirms the dynamics of intra- acting entities. In this view, agency is "cut loose from its traditional humanist orbit" and disengaged from notions of "human intentionality or subjectivity" (826).</page><page sequence="9">Sarah Bezan 199 Moreover, the material body is a component - rather than a sole actant - of causality, and "intra-action" is understood only as relations of jointly-produced causes and agencies. The decomposition of Joseph and Celice aptly corresponds to a reading of intra-action, since the unmitigated process of their decay is made possible not only through their bodies' own breakdown of tissues through autolysis, but also through the agency of micro-organisms, fungi, bacteria, insects, and even larger marine life. As they lay upon the salt dunes, Joseph and Celice are "discovered straight away" by "a beetle first. Claudatus maximi. A male." Then the "raiding parties," including gulls, dune beetles, and crabs, arrive, "drawn by the summons of fresh wounds and the smell of urine" (36). Swag flies also reach their bodies, feeding in "clinging multi- tudes" that make Celice's hair "seem more lively than it ever had in life" (39). These flies later emerge on the "fourth day from their pod larvae, generated by the putrid heat in Joseph and Celice's innards" in order to gorge on their flesh (101). Through what other method of reading, other than "intra-action," can we better understand this lively and animated assembly of organisms? Summoning this necrophagous com- munity to their own decay, Joseph and Celice enact a kind of agency that cannot be understood through traditional notions of subjectivity, observation, or intentionality. Rather, these two dead zoologists "go on" in a new mode, somewhere between objects and subjects , as their flesh is made "lively" through its dynamic interaction with non- human organisms. Installing a lively animacy through putrefaction, this agential relationality also produces a kind of post-mortem subjectivity if we understand Joseph and Celice not as individual and self-contained, but as open to what Félix Guattari calls "vectors" or "components" of subjectification created through ecological relations (24-25). Guattari's ecosophy - and especially his concept of "mental ecology" - is concerned with a re-articulation of subjectivity as an integrated and transversal relation which "will lead us to reinvent the relation of the subject to the body, to phantasm, to the passage of time, to the 'mysteries' of life and death" (24). This is not the subjected sub- ject, but a transversal subject, created and constituted through movement, becoming, and collective ecological action. We can apply this view of the subject to the living and dead body, both of which are replete with non-human organisms. Donna Haraway writes in When Species Meet , for example, that 90% of the human genome is com- posed of "cells [that] are filled with the genomes of bacteria, fungi, protists and such," so that when "T die, all benign and dangerous symbionts will take over and use what- ever is left of 'my' body." "To be one" Haraway maintains, "is always to become with many" (4, emph. Haraway's). Similarly, H. Peter Steeves affirms that contrary to con- tinental philosophy, which views the body as "self-contained within the limits of the</page><page sequence="10">200 Mosaic 48/3 (September 2015) individual flesh," the body is "not alone" because of the thousands of parasites that constitute our bodies (7). These micro-organisms, especially those that reside in the intestine - including "large numbers of chloroforms (e.g. Escherichia coli), bacilli, and micrococci" (Gunn 356-57) - become incredibly active in the dead body as they digest the soft tissues from the inside out. Life and death processes such as these take place in the organism every day as billions of cells die and are disposed of, or reconstituted, through apop- tosis. As Andrew Klarsfeld and Frédéric Revah discuss in their prodigious scientific history of thanatology in The Biology of Death, life and death processes happen con- comitantly. According to the father of modern physiology, Claude Bernard, "organs destroy themselves, disorganize themselves constantly, by their very processes" (qtd. in Klarsfeld and Revah 10). The same procedures of cellular death occur in the corpse as in the living body, and from this outlook, "existence is [. . .] nothing other than a perpetual alternation of life and death, composition and decomposition" (11). Contrary to the notion of the self-contained individual body, the human body is thus dynamically living and dead as it is also composed and decomposed of human and non- human animal elements. Understanding decomposition through the distribution of heterogeneous elements both living and dead, we can see the human organism itself as open and in a continuous state of becoming, and consider subjectivity to be inher- ently integrative and transversal at its base. Other conceptual notions of the material body as a "fold" lend further clarity to the decomposing corpse of Crace's narrative. Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Deleuze both offer a way of understanding subjectivity's anchored and incorporated position in non-human reality. New Materialist scholar Diana Coole explains that for much of Western philosophy, particularly since Descartes's anti-vitalist treatise of the mind- body dualism, subjectivity is regarded as "immaterial (disembodied), potentially omniscient, and legitimately omnipotent" (95). But for Merleau-Ponty s treatment of world-flesh and the "fold," "it is corporeality that introduces meaning or structure into matter," and it is through phenomenology that we can comprehend how consciousness "emerge[s] from, yet remains enmeshed in, this material world" (101). According to Coole, Merleau-Ponty sees the body as a two-dimensional subject-object (107) and rethinks agency not as "an essential characteristic of the rational subject" but as the contingent capacity for "reflexivity, creative disclosure, and transformation that emerge [s] hazardously within the folds and reversals of material/meaningful flesh" (1 13). As a kind of pliable hinge on the world, the body is, according to Deleuze, con- stantly "folding, unfolding, refolding" ( Fold 158). Intriguingly, Badiou describes Deleuze's interpretation of the fold as the correspondence between the surface and the</page><page sequence="11">Sarah Bezan 201 limit; or a paper folded, which constitutes the limit but is nevertheless itself still the surface (89). This description gestures toward a reading of the body as text, or the corpse as corpus, and to the consolidation of the biological and textual - or to use Barad's turn of phrase, to the entanglements of matter and meaning. Moreover, as another articulation of what a dead body can do , the corpse's active and vital fusion with the world is the very basis and origin of story. By placing story in the hands of matter, we not only recognize the biosemiotic communications of the human and non-human, but also the continually shifting and morphing codes of the natural world that form the foundation of narrative. This way of reading matter proceeds from Barad's "diffractive" reading method, which exam- ines the intersections of the material and the discursive. Serenella Iovino and Serpil Opperman re-articulate this approach from a jointly ecological and New Materialist perspective, suggesting that bodies are "living texts" (6) and that literature, when "framed as material-discursive encounters," can be understood to "emerge from the intra-action of human creativity and the narrative agency of matter." Read this way, human and non-human agents can create "new narratives and discourses that give voice to the complexity of our collective" (8). Understood as the result of agential rela- tions, narrative is made possible even outside of what we deem to be human, or even liv- ing or animate. As we see in Being Deady the corpse - whether immersed in self-directed autolysis or in the process of decomposition initiated by non-human organisms - can tell the story of its own transformation and dissolution. During the bloat stage, for instance, Joseph and Celice's bodies enact a "blacken- ing" (38), "silvering," and "jewelling" that marks a new chapter in their mortification. This discolouration, "where life's soft pink and death's smudged grey conspired to find the silver in between," also reveals "a tracery of lucent white where snails and slugs had made enamel patterns on the flesh with their saliva trails." These patterns tell the story of death in relation to what Crace describes as "Fish" (the personifica- tion of death invented by Crace's fictional writer Mondazy), which evidences itself by its silvering, its smell, its "watermark" (101), and by the residue left behind by the "wake of scales and mucilage across the sheets" (99). These patterns and markings offer a narrative of decay and necro-ecological activity. Analyzing the intersections of the material and discursive, we can apprehend the trails and patterns on the surface of Joseph and Celice's mouldering flesh as the production of story in, and through, flesh. This consolidation of text and flesh is depicted in the later pages of the novel, where Celice's corpse is likened to her rain-soaked copy of The Entomology, which lays nearby in the sand (153). Celice's portrayal as a corpse-text echoes an earlier scene in which Joseph's waterlogged body is compared to his daily ledger, left out on the deck's</page><page sequence="12">202 Mosaic 48/3 (September 2015) breakfast table: "It could well rain and wash away his ink, the records of his life. His pages would be turned to pulp" (13). Regardless of who is, or who is not, reading the story (or who observes or does not observe Joseph and Celice's decay), the corpse-as- text goes on to rot and corrode as it enters into another form of existence. This ongo- ing continuation of being is portrayed in a passage composed by the writer Mondazy, who pens in his memoir that '"Our books of Life don't have an end. Fresh chapters are produced [. . .] Our pages never terminate. But, given time, the paper yellows, then turns green. The vellum flesh becomes the leaf" (144). The mouldering narrative of Being Dead , spun out of slimy trails and the salt-line of the outgoing tide on the surface of the corpse, is guided by the vitality and agency of an ecological subjectivity. It is through this unique set of agential relations in death that story, for Crace, finds its origin. If Crace's narrative novel finds comes its origin to a literal in material end, and agency, although then where Joseph does and it Celice's terminate? bodies While are Crace's novel comes to a literal end, and although Joseph and Celice's bodies are discovered and cleared away from the beach by the novel's conclusion, it is clear that Being Dead outlines a long and never-ending narrative of putrefaction that extends beyond the individual deaths of the two zoologists and into an eternity of being dead in the world. Evidence of this ongoing narrative is found in the epigraph, which is credited to another of Crace's fictional writers, Sherwin Stephens. The first half of Stephens's "The Biologist's Valediction to His Wife" reads: Don't count on Heaven, or on Hell. You're dead. That's it. Adieu. Farewell. Eternity awaits? Oh, sure! It's Putrefaction and Manure And unrelenting Rot, Rot, Rot, As you regress, from Zoo. to Bot. The regression of the organism as it is depicted in Crace's fictional epigraph has no absolute end, but continues to intermix with, and become, the earth. Thus, in imag- ining this eternal synthesis of decay and pursuing the effects of the wide-reaching vitality of ongoing rot and putrefaction, the plot line of Being Dead spins ahead toward an infinite time and space that is beyond that which is possible to reason. This means that Crace's novel gestures toward what Derrida describes as the "aporia" of death: "The refused, denied, or prohibited passage, indeed the nonpassage" that is the atopos or nowhere place of death (Aporias 8). To understand how Crace's narrative imagines an eternity of vital decomposition in a post-mortem world, it is important to examine how the timeline of Being Dead</page><page sequence="13">Sarah Bezan 203 operates. According to literary critic Adam Begley, Crace's narrative runs on a double- stranded "necrometer" that goes backward and forward in time, juxtaposing both the distant and recent past with the decomposing present ("Quiet"). This necrometer, as Susan Balée writes, "operates like a double helix. While one strand composes the nar- rative of the protagonists' lives, the other decomposes the narrative of their deaths" (513). However, this approach to the time-space structure of the novel falls short of acknowledging the boundless possibilities of being dead in the world. By linking the plot line to Joseph and Celice's mortal time-scale, Begley łs necrometer fits more into a framework of finitude that assigns a definitive beginning and end to life. This frame- work can be understood in relation to Haraway s outline of human and non-human animal time-scales, which are either evolutionary "at the level of the planet earth and its natural cultural species," or face-to-face "at the scale of mortal bodies and individ- ual lifetimes" ( Companion 63). Reading Begley 's interpretation of the necrometer through Haraway's time scale outline places Crace's narrative on a "face-to-face" or mortal time scale that shares the same time-space foundation as natural, scientific, and traditional philosophical notions of time, but does not adequately account for the time and space of being dead in the novel. While a detailed analysis of time and duration (as explored by Henri Bergson and Heidegger) lies outside the parameters of this essay, it is important to examine how the mortal time-space foundation of death for natural science, along with Heidegger's philosophy in particular, is anchored to a concretely mortal world. Although some organisms challenge typical mortal time scales, either by replicating continuously and leaving no corpse behind to measure an end (such as some bacteria), or by living on for grand lengths of time (such as the sequoia tree), it is nevertheless the case that nat- ural science depends on the order and length of species timelines, or their senescence, in order to determine their essential differences. Along with natural science, philoso- phy on the human and non-human animal consonantly abounds with considerations of "animal worlds" that respond to the question of mortality (Acampora 117). Heidegger's world-forming Dasein , for instance, is linked to a mortal timeline that beholds death as the maturation of a living being. Heidegger compares this being's "not-yetness" and "being towards-death" to the moon in its last quarter, which is "out- standing until it is full," or to fruit that is moving toward its own ripening (234). Heidegger's approach to death is about the future of death's insuperable coming as an impossible certainty that lies embedded in the past. A vitalism of decomposition, and the time-space structure that arises from it, dissents from this natural scientific and philosophical treatise of being, time, and world as it pursues the possibility of life to advance indefinitely.</page><page sequence="14">204 Mosaic 48/3 (September 2015) This emphasis on the representation of the inexhaustible possibilities of being in the world is a clear-cut aim of Crace's novel and of his wider oeuvre. Crace's fictional works are often meticulously constructed around created worlds, distinct "imaginary milieus," and "new fictional landscapes" (Chalupsky 40). Begley remarks that reading Crace's works brings readers into "Craceland," which scholar Philip Tew argues "is a world constituted by ongoing, cumulative change" ( Crace 29) but which differs from any modernist, post-modernist, or any typically British conception of topography and literary space ( Contemporary 151). Being Dead in particular, Tew writes, is about exploring the ways in which "death is immanent in life" ( Crace xv). I would add that Crace's focus on an ecology of death results in a narrative that shifts into over- ripeness and rot (to modify Heidegger's metaphor), where there is no end to the potential relations and transformations that are yet-to-come in the interminable world of being dead. Such a perspective on "world" in Crace's literary landscape means that the earth is understood to conduct its own burial and manage the unceasing bodily transfor- mations of its inhabitants. For instance, as the novel draws to its close, we read that it is "a pity that the police dogs ever caught the scent of human carrion and led their poking masters to the dunes to clear away the corpses for 'proper burial,' so that the dead could be less splendid in a grave. The dunes could have disposed of Joseph and Celice themselves. They didn't need help. The earth is practiced in the craft of burial" (193). Imagining a post-mortem earth, Crace's narrative suggests that the world embraces and adopts the dead. Joseph and Celice would have turned to landscape, given time. Their bodies would have been just something extra dead in a landscape already sculpted out of death [. . .]. So, had it not been for the dogs, the residues of Joseph and Celice's lives would have been tossed and tumbled in the dunes to nourish and renew themselves in different forms. They might have found a brief eternity below the sand, together at first, still touching, but soon they'd have to separate, to weave and drift into the unremarking sea, or sink into the clods and pebbles of the earth. (194) Crace's post-mortem vision of the world is not divided between the living and dead (as in the humanist schema of life and death), but intimately connected in a process of burial and transformation. This imagination of a natural reality that cannot be rationalized evokes what Deleuze and Guattari regard as a call for new concepts for thinking that produce "a new earth " and " a new people " (99, emph. Deleuze and Guattari's). What this call for thinking a new people and a new earth entails, specifically for the purposes of this</page><page sequence="15">Sarah Bezan 205 analysis, is a way of reaching outside of the conventional tenets of reason on the sub- ject of death. For death is, Derrida insists, the "impossibility, the impracticability, or nonpassage [. . .] the impossibility of being dead" ( Aporias 73). Death is that nowhere place; that "ultimate otherworldliness," as Tew suggests ( Grace 142). While we cannot enter into death and live to tell about it, we can initiate a new way of thinking death through the literary imagination. This literary practice achieves something, as Wolfe argues, that philosophy cannot ( Posthumanism 84). Unlike philosophical treatises of death, the literary imagination can enable the kind of thinking made possible by writ- ers like Crace, who question, as Elizabeth Costello does in Coetzee's fiction, what it is like to be a corpse (32). When we imagine what might come of letting dead matter and non-human agents tell their story, we invoke a vision of a post-mortem world that exists outside of our individual selves and beyond the limits of what we can rea- son or set into frameworks of knowledge. It is to imagine a world like Crace's, where "all along the shores of Baritone Bay and all the coast beyond, tide after tide, time after time, the corpses and the broken, thinned remains of fish and birds, of barnacles and rats, of molluscs, mammals, mussels, crabs are lifted, washed and sorted by the waves" (196). As Being Dead reveals, the post-mortem world is equipped to care for those that continue to dwell on the earth. To acknowledge this is to understand a necro-ecology in its fullest sense: as a set of relations that is deeply embedded in the structure of the world composed of organisms both human and animal, living and dead. This is a vision of the world that does not expose us, but encloses us in a community of new, alternative relations plotted along the shifting coordinates (or longitudes and lati- tudes) of being dead in the world. Beyond what we can observe or understand, the narrative of decay goes on, giving voice to a world of vital and agential relations that return us to the ever-shifting tides and settling soils of the earth.
