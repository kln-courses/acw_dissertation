<plain_text><page sequence="1">draw only from a single collection inevitably limits the comprehensiveness of the show. Perhaps this is the result of a recurring prob- lem for curators endeavoring to circumvent the myriad administrative restrictions that now control the mounting of an exhibition. Yet, there is much to be said for being able to observe the coherence within a collection of diverse pieces, sustained by a single owner's taste and judgment. It is not often that such complete personal accumulations are on dis- play, and we must be grateful to Valerie Franklin for allowing this opportunity to ad- mire some of the major pieces in her collec- tion. Elisabeth L. Cameron Pasadena, California THE RISING OF A NEW MOON A Century of Tabwa Art National Museum of African Art Washington, D.C. January 29-March 17, 1986 This exhibition was the culmination of a three-year project presenting the first in- depth study of the art and culture of the Tabwa people of eastern Zaire and northern Zambia. The project integrated the disciplines of art history and social anthropology in order to investigate the complicated stylistic varia- tions of Tabwa art over the past hundred years and to explicate the meaning of these artistic forms and symbols as a function of changing political, social, and economic envi- ronments. Supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities with addi- tional help from Sabena Belgian World Air- lines, the exhibition was conceived as an overview of Tabwa art from the mid- nineteenth century to the present. It con- tained ninety-eight objects carefully selected from over twenty-six public and private col- lections from seven countries, including the Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale, Tervuren; British Museum; Royal Scottish Museum; Staatliche Museen Preussischer Kulturbesitz, Berlin; Linden-Museum, Stuttgart; Staatliches Museum fur V6olkerkunde, Munich; Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etno- grafico (Museo Pigorini) of Rome; and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Approximately half of the objects repre- sented the major stylistic categories of Tabwa figural sculpture. These were centered around three historically important objects from the third quarter of the nineteenth cen- tury: figures of the ancestors of chiefs Lusinga, Kansabala, and Manda. Collected in 1884 by the Belgian Emile Storms, the carvings were generously lent by the Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale, which holds the world's largest and most representative collections of Tabwa art and material culture. The two most important categories of anthropomorphic sculpture, the figure on another's shoulders and cylindrical twin figures, were also fea- tured to demonstrate various sculptural themes developed in different geographical areas over many generations.

Along with this concentration on figural sculpture, the exhibition described the mask- ing tradition, including rare anthropomor- phic examples as well as the more common buffalo mask. To the pieces from these two groups, which formed the core of the show, were added the finest examples of the other object types, such as staffs, axes, paddles and whisks, pipes, bellows, high-backed stools, neckrests, combs and items of personal adornment, musical instruments, and bas- kets. The exhibition and its accompanying catalogue have provided an opportunity to broach a number of theoretical issues in the cross-disciplinary study of African art. The first of these is the matter of ethnicity. Many Tabwa objects have been attributed to groups called "Kunda," "Tumbwe," "Holoholo," "Djidji," or other names subsumed by the term "Tabwa." Tabwa live at the crossroads of important routes along which people, goods, and ideas have long moved. The history of such commerce must be complemented by studying the social mechanisms by which ethnic identity is defined and shared, if one is to understand who has produced the art ob- jects in question. The next question must be: if neighboring (and better-known) groups such as the Hemba and Luba have produced so many works of art, why have Tabwa made and used so few? A sense of Tabwa history is essential here, for one can hypothesize that there was a sudden and relatively brief flowering of art, STANDING MALE FIGURE. WOOD, CANING, HORN, STRING. SEED PODS.

In the early nineteenth century Tabwa lived in small, virtually autonomous villages, led by chiefs chosen from the lineages of original settlers. Art ob- jects were made to be used in ritual, to facili- tate change from one state of affairs to another (as, say, in cases of the resolution of misfor- tune). Such "process art," to borrow a distinc- tion drawn by Malcolm McLeod, is still impor- tant to Tabwa as they cope with personal dif- ficulties or moments of transition. Beginning in the 1850s, though, several Tabwa chiefs were able to consolidate their powers through participation in the ivory and slave trade to the coast. As their rule became increasingly absolute, they commissioned objects of "statement art" to focus their subjects' atten- tion on this newfound royalty. Ancestral fig- 71</page><page sequence="2">ures were made larger and more ornate; high-backed thrones, scepter staffs, whisks, and other regalia were produced. Tabwa visited by early European explorers were masters of scarification, hairdressing, and other body arts that both beautified and communicated. These are represented in the plastic arts of the times. Such objects were decorated with motifs that expressed the fun- damentals of Tabwa philosophy, in order to associate the chiefs with all that is wise and powerful. The most common motif, a series of isosceles triangles often juxtaposed in divided diamonds, is called "the rising of the new moon" (balamwezi). Like any symbol, balam- wezi is multireferential. The rising of a new moon represents the triumph of light over dark, wisdom over ignorance, good over evil. The triangle may symbolize the most impor- tant positions of the moon, near western and eastern horizons and at the zenith; it also stands for social triangles, when a person (the FEMALE FIGURE (ONE OF A PAIR). WOOD, BEADS, 46.3cm. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART apex of the triangle) is pulled by opposing forces and loyalties (the basal points). The moon, for instance, is anthropomorphized as an archetypal male married to two wives, the Morning and Evening Stars (Venus in the east and west). Tabwa tell humorous tales of how the moon is drawn between the domestic skills and nurturing of his first wife, and the sexiness of his second; the stories and the triangular motif are means to contemplate conjugal politics. There are other important dilemmas in Tabwa social life, always me- diated by a person whose attention is pulled both ways at once. Motifs on ancestral fig- ures (and other objects), such as the body midline so often elaborated by a line of scarifi- cation, reflect this duality. Left and Right are defined by these lines as symmetrical, yet op- posite in the qualities associated with them (receptivity, decline, and femaleness versus action, initiative, and maleness, respectively). The midline divides these, but also connects head and loins, hence wisdom and sexuality, which each, in turn, mediates such differ- ences. These complexities of thought are ren- dered in Tabwa art with great economy, through the simplest motifs. The flowering of the arts ended as suddenly as it began. Tabwa were prohibited from pub- lic celebration of their religion by zealous col- onizers who sought to bring them "civiliza- tion." Their lands were at the heart of a "Christian Kingdom" founded by Catholic missionaries, separating the Tabwa from the rest of the Congo Free State in ways that even now have ramifications in modern Zaire. The traditional forms were no longer appropriate in the colonial economy based upon personal initiative and accumulation of wealth. New ones would assist Tabwa in an ontological shift of focus from community to the indi- vidual. Although "statement art" had ceased being produced, art was given forms that could be "hidden in plain sight"-that is, seen but probably not understood by coloni- zers. Tabwa creativity did not stop, then, but was redirected. "The rising of the new moon" motif and the ideas it represents, however, remained im- portant. In a new religious movement based upon individual catharsis rather than com- munity cooperation, possession by an earth spirit is a personal triumph. Entering such a trance is referred to by the same verb used to describe the rising of a new moon. The most important object used in this movement is a basket decorated with the balamwezi motif. The enlightenment and courage to overcome adversity in these new circumstances are therefore linked to past trials and triumphs of the Tabwa, as represented in their arts. After closing at the University of Michigan Museum of Art on July 17, the exhibition is scheduled to appear at the Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale, Tervuren, in September and October. The catalogue (300 pp., over 600 illustrations, $39.95 cloth) is available from the National Museum of African Art, Smith- sonian Institution, Washington, DC 20560. Allen F. Roberts and Evan M. Maurer The University of Michigan ART OF THE GURO, IVORY COAST The Center for African Art, New York City January 8 - April 6, 1986 Organized by Eberhard Fischer, Director of the Museum Rietberg in Zurich, this first comprehensive exhibition devoted to the Guro brought together 150 works belonging not only to the Rietberg but also to museums and private collectors in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, England, France, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Italy, and the United States. Conceived in 1974 by Fischer, it was based on field trips he conducted in 1975 and 1984 with Lorenz Homberger. It is always a treat to see an exhibit that fo- cuses on a single ethnic group, as it provides the opportunity for intensive study. The "Art of the Guro" allowed the viewer to ponder the essence of an artistic tradition as well as to explore regional variations, particular artists' styles, and the range in interpretation of a single type of object, such as the Zamble mask. According to Susan Vogel, Executive Direc- tor of the Center, the exhibit was organized to present both how the Guro see their work and how Westerners are accustomed to viewing it. In 1934 Hans Himmelheber recorded a weaver's comment, "One cannot live without beautiful things"; another has remarked, "It is pleasing to see something of beauty before you as you work." To Westerners these statements seem self-evident, accustomed as we are to approaching African art without ref- erence to its context, but they reveal a facet of the Guro aesthetic that is unusual: an ap- preciation of beauty for its own sake. There was much to be learned from this exhibition, in terms of the objects' context as well as our own appreciation of the nuances of this re- markable artistic tradition. The sheer diversity within the mask genre was impressive. The first room presented twenty-eight animal and human faces vary- ing in size, coiffure, facial scarification, and color. Some were old, others were modern, like Mamy Wata or an example depicting a man wearing an army cap and glasses, and smoking a pipe. Making sense of this array in terms of their meaning for the Guro was facili- tated by the seven costumed figures seen next to photo enlargements of these masked dan- cers in action, and by the accompanying text. We learned that the Guro have a group of sac- red masks as well as ones worn solely for en- tertainment. Sacred dances may consist of Gye and the mask family of Zamble, Zauli, and Gu in the north, or the Dye ensemble among the western and' southern Guro. The mannequins illustrated Zamble and Gu, both wearing costumes combining animal skin and plant fibers (of the bush or forest) and woven cloth (of the civilized world). A mannequin of Gye, most powerful of all masks, and four of Dye were also clothed in fiber. The heddle pulleys in the same room, adorned with sensitively carved human and animal heads, exerted a more subtle attrac- tion. As the accompanying label explained, the Guro value the elegant profile, especially 72</page></plain_text>
