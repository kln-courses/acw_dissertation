<plain_text><page sequence="1">447 THE AKIKUYU. THE most important Bantu tribes of the East Africa Protec- torate are the Akikuyu and the Akamba. Till lately, no special work has been devoted to either of them. A good deal of information about the Akamba in the middle of the last century may be gleaned from the travels of Krapf, who visited their country twice, in 1849 and 1851, but of the Akikuyu he has only a few scattered notices. Count Teleki (in 1887) was the first to traverse their country, which was subsequently visited by Mr. Scott-Elliot, Dr. Gregory, Mr. Arkell-Hard- wick (I9oo), Major Powell Cotton (1903), and others. Sir Charles Eliot devotes to them a certain amount of space in his East Africa Protectorate, and we must not forget some valuable papers by Mr. C. W. Hobley, Mr. Dundas, and Mr. H. R. Tate, which have appeared in the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, in Man, and in this JOURNAL. But the fullest account yet published is contained in the splendidly illustrated volume in which Mr. and Mrs. Routledge have collected their East African experiences.' As it happens, it has been followed, at no very long interval, by Mr. Hobley's Ethnology of the Akamba and Other East African Tribes, which, while in some respects less readable than the larger work, is likely to remain a unique mine of information for many years to come. We hope to have an opportunity of reviewing it at length in a future number. Mr. Routledge first visited the Kikuyu country in 1902, when he accompanied Mr. Sidney Hinde to Fort Hall, then recently established as the first station of Kenya Province. He subsequently fixed his permanent camp near Nyeri, and, "using this as a dep6t . . . travelled about the country, 1 With a Prshistoric People: The Akikuyu of BritisA East Africa.-Being some account of the method of life and mode of thought found existent amongst a nation on its first contact with European civilisation.

Arnold, 19Io.</page><page sequence="2">448 JOURNAL OF THE AFRICAN SOCIETY shooting, photographing, collecting, and taking notes, and not only never had any serious trouble with the natives, but on the contrary, became great friends with various influential men over a wide extent of country." After two years spent in this way, Mr. Routledge returned home, but subsequently revisited Africa in company with his wife, who was equally, if not more successful in gaining the confidence and friend- ship of the natives. The authors are probably right in thinking that, as regards their inquiries, "a gain in certain directions undoubtedly arose from the absence of all connec- tion with officialdom and hut-tax on the one hand, or religious propaganda on the other." The result of their collaboration is one of the best anthropological works issued in recent years. Their modus operandi has been explained by each separately in the Preface, to which we may refer the reader, only remark- ing that the apology on p. xix appears to us quite unneces- sary, and that the "general reader" has every reason to be as well satisfied as the scientist. The Appendices include a letter descriptive of "Camp Life in Kikuyu," a short chapter on "The Masai," an essay by Mr. R. R. Marett, on "The Place of Kikuyu Thought in the Comparative Study of Religions," an additional note on the dancing-costumes of warriors, and a note on iron-smelting contributed.by Professor Gowland, to which is added a note with illustrative sketch by the late Colonel Grant, describing the process as witnessed by him in Unyamwezi. In a letter written to the late Sir Lowthian Bell in 1878, the veteran traveller says :- "Men go through Africa with their eyes shut to this par- ticular wealth. They record that natives make all their simple tools, but they stop without further inquiry, because there is not an opened-up mine in the whole of Central Africa, not even a pit dug to give the traveller cause for inquiring its purpose. All, as far as I know, is got from the surface ore." The book, apart from the Introduction and the Appendices, is divided into four main sections, headed respectively, "The People and their Pursuits," "Social and Political Life," " Religion," and "Folklore." The first of the5e includes such subjects as dress, land and agriculture, flocks and herds, food</page><page sequence="3">THE AKIkJYU 449 and cookery, and " Arts and Crafts." Every one of these sections is very fully illustrated with excellent photographs. Part II., for which Mrs. Routledge is chiefly responsible, contains notes on family life, and more especially the position and occupations of women, Social Customs and Ceremonies (including, among others, the remarkable ceremony of the "Second Birth," initiation into the tribe, funeral customs, and blood brotherhood), and Political Life. This last heading is subdivided into "Political Organization," "Administration," "Notes taken at Kikuyu Trials," "Codes of Justice," and " Efficacy of Kikuyu Justice." This last, though it is difficult to particularise, where the whole is so excellent, contains some of the most valuable matter in the book. Some of the subjects dealt with are also touched upon by Mr. H. R. Tate in his paper, "Native Law of the Southern Gikuyu" (JOURNAL for April, 190o). Where the two accounts differ, the reason is probably to be found in a difference of local usage, as Mr. Tate's observations were made in the southern district, among Kinyanjui's people. "Kikuyu polity," we are told (p. 195), "is local government run mad. The unit of all life is . . . the homestead, the dwelling-place of the family." "For military purposes a number, varying it is stated from two to perhaps ten of these homesteads, would, prior to the British occupation, unite under a leader or headman. No man would serve under any other leader and usually declined to obey his own. . . . Geographical boundaries in an un- dulating country, or possibly the local distribution of popula. tion consequent on the first settlement of new land, suggested even to the Akikuyu some further combination. Vague districts or larger groups of homesteads existed whose inhabi- tants would, it might be expected, be also united by a blood tie. As a matter of fact, however, the various clans do not seem to be associated with particular localities, and such bonds would always be limited by the rules of the clans as to intermarriage. The number of headmen in each district of course varied. One district was quoted as having perhaps ten of such leaders, others might have only five, or as many as twenty or thirty. These neighbouring headmen acted, on 29 Vol. 10</page><page sequence="4">450 JOURNAL OF THE AFRICAN SOCIETY occasion, at any rate, after some fashion 'n concert, and the influence of one of their number appears to nave pre- dominated. The great bond of union was, however, the advice of one Medicine-Man. . . . Even these districts, or political areas, if they deserve so definite a name, were generally limited in the extreme; one valley engaged in warfare with another, the people in the valley fought those on the hillside; a small stream separated friends from foes. Several districts might occasionally unite under one Medicine-Man against an enemy such as the Masai, but no great conqueror ever seems to have arisen to weld the tribe into one people. Even in the present days of comparative centralisation there are, according to a list compiled by Mr. Macgregor, at least one hundred and two chiefs in the land. "For all civil purposes of government, the head of the homestead is, ipso facto, a ruler. There is no council of the nation . . . the government is patriarchal, or, as far as it rises to the dignity of a state, in the hands of the councils of old men. These meet, confer, and act in varying numbers according to the interest or exigencies of the case." There is a tendency, especially marked in recent times, for one man, distinguished by ability or force of character, to rise to pre-eminence in such assemblies, and this has to a certain extent been encouraged by British administrative methods. In fact, "chieftainship itself in its present form, is an English creation." But the chief, where there is one, "is still not dis- tinguished in theory from the rest of the people. His daughter fetches no higher mali [=bride-price or dowry]. The money which would be paid in compensation for his death (his wergild in Anglo-Saxon phraseology) is no greater than that of the commonalty. He is entitled to no special funeral rites. The greatest astonishment was expressed on the question being asked if one of the principal chiefs would, if he were to die, receive the tribute of honour due to old men, in being accorded burial. ' He was only a young man,' it was explained. ' He would, of course, like the rest of the world, be put out for the hyenas.' " The funeral customs, it will be observed, resemble those of the Nandi and Masai, which are also followed by the Akamba.</page><page sequence="5">THE AKIKUYU 451 These customs are described by Mrs. Routledge on pp. 168- 173. "Burial is reserved as a mark of honour for a man who is old and rich, and has in the ordinary course at least two grown up sons to perform the necessary rites." There are-to return to the subject of social organisation- two degrees of official eldership. The first of these is called Moranja, and is entered by every married man after the birth of his second child. He attains to the second rank, Kiama, when his first child is old enough to be formally admitted to the tribe. The Kiama form the council of elders proper. Besides these two ranks, there is a body of men, the Njama, who might be described as "practical executive or glorified voluntary police." The Akikuyu says, "In old days we were told the Njama were as chiefs," so that probably they formerly possessed a greater importance than they now do. This might help to clear up an apparent contradiction. In Sir Charles Eliot's East Africa Protectorate, we read (p. 127), "They still have a warlike strain in them, which shows itself in continual robberies, raids, and inter-tribal quarrels," while Mr. Routledge says (p. i6), "As a nation they are devoid of the military instinct; as individuals they do not cultivate proficiency in arms." The truth seems to be that no genuine Negro or Bantu race is ever essentially warlike in character, whatever temporary habits may be forced on it by circumstances. The really militant and predatory tribes are Hamites, either pure, as the Somali, or mixed, to a slight degree, as the Masai. (It will be observed that directly the Masai begin to intermarry with their Bantu neighbours, they tend to become sedentary and agricultural; or perhaps, the order of the two steps should be reversed; in any case the pacific tendency is associated with the Bantu race.) The success with which, under pressure of stern necessity, the Akikuyu learnt to defend themselves against the constant raids of the Masai, may be gauged from pp. 12-16 (the picture of the "war-pit " on p. 14 should certainly be avoided by persons of sensitive nerves). Their weapons are bows and poisoned arrows, the Njuguma or "life-preserver" (= knob- kerry), the spear and the sword (see Plate V.), in the use of which last they are really proficient. But it should be noted</page><page sequence="6">452 JOURNAL OF THE AFRICAN SOCIETY that "slavery as an institution did not exist among them, nor did they make raids for the capture of slaves." Sir Charles Eliot says that, though the Akikuyu are not subject to a single head, their chiefs are of greater importance than those of the other Bantu tribes, and such men as Kin- yanjui, near Nairobi, and Karuri, near Nyeri, are important allies of the Government, to which they show perfect loyalty, for they can each put several hundred men into the field. There are also a multitude of smaller chiefs." . . . (East Africa Protectorate, p. 128.) Perhaps the former prominence of the Njama may be re- sponsible for the evolution of these chiefs, whose power, however, Sir Charles Eliot seems to estimate more highly than Mrs. Routledge is disposed to do. The term Njama "is used when speaking of the headmen who used to take the lead in war, and it may therefore be presumed that the members of the force are the representatives of the former military leaders, who were persons of power and position. . 0. .The body has a head. It consists of young men, and all are eligible, but newcomers . . . are co-opted. They pay their footing by means of the usual goat. Their powers are somewhat vague, and include judicial attributes; but, generally speaking, it may be said that with them rests the keeping of order, more especially in regard to affairs or delinquencies outside the immediate homestead, or in which more than one district is concerned. . . . One supreme effort to make clear their duties evolved the statement that they ' go and tell people not to kill other people on the road.' Their position . . . can also be one of considerable tyranny. Theoretically, offences among this body are dealt with by the Kiama, but it is not surprising that the Njama of a district have been known on occasion to become little better than a body of freebooters. In some districts (e.g. Nairobi and Karuri's) members of the Njama are obliged to resign on becoming qualified to enter the Kiama, in others (e.g. Munge's) they can continue in the body if they desire to do so." On entering the Moranja class a man has usually to "give a goat to the members of the grade to celebrate the occasion,"</page><page sequence="7">TIHE AKIKUYU 453 he is also supposed to forswear youthful frivolities, keep his head shaved, wear no ornaments, and cease to attend dances. When admitted to the Kiama, he has, first to give one goat to the Njama, and then, after the initiation of his eldest child, two goats to the Kiama, "and is then a fully initiated member of the old men or governing class."'' "The Kiama has a wand of office and wears a particular type of earring. There is also sentiment attached in his case to the bunch of leaves which Akikuyu often carry on a journey, and which takes the place of a handkerchief. This with a Kiama is formed of one particular herbage (the shrub known as Matura Nguru), and any unauthorised person seen using it comes under his curse. When no longer needed, the bunch must not be thrown away, but placed on the top of one of the little barns in the homestead." The list of Kikuyu clans given on p. 21 corresponds very nearly with those given by Mr. Tate in this JOURNAL for April, I9ro. Some of the differences, however, appear to be merely due to local differences of pronunciation, e.g. "Aize- randu" ard "Aitherandu," "Ethaga" and "Aithaga," &amp;c. Two clans, the Agachiku and the Mwesaga (Mwizaga) are forbidden to work iron, and the latter are believed to have, in addition, certain mysterious powers. "All males of the clan can see rain coming and can stop it, and for them to express admiration of any person is to bring about evil." According to Mr. Hobley, this clan is "supposed to be under a curse"; its members frequently "go off into the forest and wander about in a mad state and eventually die." The Mwizaga are also bound to preserve certain land as woodlands. This is a beneficial regulation, considering how the forests have been destroyed over the greater part of the country, with the exception of the sacred groves, which are usually found on hill-tops. (See p. 38.) A certain species of ficus, known as Muti Mugu (Mundu Mugu is the "medicine-man ") is also considered sacred, and never intentionally cut down. It is probably the same tree which has a similar character among the Akamba, and, more or less, throughout Africa. I See Mr. Tate's paper in the AprilJournal, p. 294. ' C. W. Hobley, Ethnology of the Akamba and Other East African Tribes, (Cambridge University Press), p. 85.</page><page sequence="8">454 JOURNAL OF THE AFRICAN SOCIETY The accounts of ceremonies, especially those of admission into the tribe (pp. 154-167), and the dance on the completion of the maize-harvest (pp. 188-191), and the whole section headed "Religion," are exceedingly interesting, though, un- fortunately, our limits forbid very extensive quotation. The name for the Supreme Being, Ngai, is borrowed from the Masai. The Akamba use both Mulungu and Engai. We dannot gather that the former name is ever used by the Akikuyu, but possibly it was so in former times. At solemn sacrifices the Deity is addressed as Mwininyaga, "Possessor of Whiteness." Kirinyaga, "Place of Whiteness," is the Kikuyu name for Mount Kenya, with which, it is interesting to observe, Ngai appears to be more or less identified. "We were riding home one evening, with a particularly glorious sunset lighting up the summit of Mount Kenya, which rose above a belt of golden cloud, when our friend Wamaheu volunteered, 'God (Ngai) lives on Kenya. The Swahilis and the missionaries say that he lives in the sky, but they are wrong. He has no father nor mother nor wife nor children, he is all alone '" (p. 226). The spirits of the dead (pp. 239-244) are called, not as in most cases, Mizimu or some cognate word, but Ngoma, which, elsewhere, curiously enough, means "a drum." (Drums are very generally connected with exorcism, and, in Swahili, ngoma means, not only a drum, but a dance, or a ceremony of exorcism. Umgoma in Zulu, is another name for is-anusi, "a wizard," and ingoma is a particular song sung at the Feast of First-Fruits, but not a drum; in fact, drums are not much used by the Zulus. Ingomane is a drumming on shields with sticks, also practised at the feast of First-Fruits, and may preserve some connection with the original meaning of the word.) The Akamba call these spirits Aiimu, which is the same word as Mizimu (or Wazimu). The Ngoma does not come into being till after a man's death. "In reply to a question, ' Where is my Ngoma now ? ' the answer was received, ' It does not exist.'" They may take up their abode in the sacred fig-tree already mentioned, or in various animals or birds-the hyena, the hungu, or</page><page sequence="9">THE AKIKUYU 455 kite, certain caterpillars, &amp;c. They also, apparently, wander about invisible, and you may hear them " dancing in the wilds and making a noise," " a whirring sound," according to some accounts. (It is remarkable that while the bull- roarer (Kehuruta) is known to the Akikuyu, they only use It for the every-day purpose of scaring birds, and it does not seem to be associated with spirits or mysteries.) The Akamba, similarly believe in haunted woods, and several such places are definitely pointed out. There is one, Mr. Hobley tells us, about fifteen miles south of Machako, where, it is related, some women once went to cut firewood. " Having chopped their sticks, they hoisted their loads on their backs and started for home, but before they had reached the edge of the wood their loads were set on fire by the Aiimu, so they hurriedly dropped their bundles, unfastened their straps, and fled; and it is said that directly the sticks were dropped, they ceased to blaze." (Akamba, p. 87.) Mtoro bin Mwenyi Bakari (Swahili teacher at the Hamburg Colonial Institute), in an account of the customs of the Wadoe, also mentions a place of the same kind near Nguu, in German East Africa, where "on some days, drums and shouting are heard, as if a wedding were being celebrated." Besides what might be called "the orthodox religion," there are various local societies of a semi-secret character, which practise a kind of snake-worship. " In Karuri's country there are two such societies. It has been estimated that about half of the population are adherents of this cult, which is known as Aitwika. Any outsider treating the subject with disrespect is obliged to forfeit a sheep, in default of which he is severely beaten and his house burnt. The worship of the snake has been twice celebrated by a great festival during the generation which is now in middle life, and known as Mwangi.' The first festival was held in 1891. Preparations began for the second festival in September, 1903." These extend over two years. The particulars given on 1 See Mr. Tate's paper in the April Journal, p. 289. The names of the "generations" there given are nearly (but not quite) identical with those in Mr. Routledge's list, p. 9.</page><page sequence="10">456 JOURNAL OF THE AFRICAN SOCIETY pp. 237-8 (derived from information supplied by Mr. McGregor of the C.M.S., author of a Kikuyu Vocabulary and Grammar), are somewhat tantalising, and one would, in par- ticular, like to know whether the snake (Ndamathia) is a real or a mythical one. It is worth noting that "the festival seems to be associated with the rainy season and the appearance of the rainbow." The connection between the rainbow and a snake crops up elsewhere, e.g. on the Congo and in Southern Nigeria, as described by Mr. Dennett. Pp. 249-281 deal with the subject of the "Medicine-Man " (Plate CXXVI., is an excellent photograph of such a practi- tioner, in the act of preparing "medicine" for protection against lions), also divination, charms, witchcraft, &amp;c. The particulars given as to the initiation of a doctor (pp. 251-4) are of especial interest. The profession is not hereditary, and is, as a rule, adopted in obedience to the promptings of dreams or visions. Under "Witchcraft" is given (p. 273) an account of the mysterious object known as the Kithathi, or Githathi (Mr. Routledge calls it Kithasi) referred to by Mr. Tate in this JOURNAL for April, 19go. Mr. Routledge says that no man living has seen it, and it "is said to have been passed down from father to son for six generations, namely, from the Mathathi age. . . . Report speaks of it as a stone which was found by an ancestor of the present holder "-one Degua wa Kimani, in Karuri's district-"and that it has fourteen holes, seven on the one side and seven on the other. Now, by the Akikuyu the number 7 . . . is considered of all the most unlucky, when divination by numbers is sought at the hands of their medicine-men. Hence this object, with its two sets of seven holes, naturally lends itself in their imagina- tion to mystic use of an evil character." Mr. Hobley has been fortunate enough to see the Githathi for himself, and to be present at a trial conducted by its means. This is described in his work already alluded to, Ethnology of the Akamba and Other East African Tribes (pp. 139-142). He gives a sketch showing it to be a section of clay pipe, sloped off at the ends, and having four circular holes in its circumference-which does not quite tally with the information received by Mr. Routledge. It is about 41 inches</page><page sequence="11">THE AKIKUYU 457 in length by 24 inches in diameter. Mr. Hobley says, "This object is in charge of a certain old man of the tribe, who always keeps it buried in the bush at some distance from a village. It is so powerful that it must never be taken into a house, or the result would be disastrous to the inmates; it must never be touched by human hands, but is lifted up on a stick and deposited in a pocket made of dry banana leaves. The parcel is then tied up, and it can be carried safely from place to place. .... Inquiries were made as to the history of the Kithathi, but beyond the fact that an elder of about 70 said it was used in his grandfather's time, and that it was said to have originally come from Ukamba, little was discovered. The late Captain Merker, however, informed the writer that the Chaga people on Kilimanjaro use similar magic objects; in that region some are, however, anthropomorphic." X The Rev. J. Raum, in the appendix to his Chaga Grammar,2 gives two remarkable native accounts of ordeals, one of which, that by the "cursing-pot " (reminding us of the " swearing-pot " used by the Andoni-see JOURNAL for July, 1905, PP. 411, 415), is apparently analogous to the Githathi trial, but differs in several important particulars; and the "pot " is an ordinary piece of crockery, in no respect anthro- pomorphic. Here we must also refer in passing to the curious image used by the Akikuyu at the maize dance, as described by Mr. Routledge on pp. I9o, 191. We have to thank Mr. and Mrs. Routledge for the fullest account yet available of a people who, whatever shortcomings may be laid to their charge, have qualities calculated to give them a high place among the "resources " of the Protectorate. " Hard-working, intelligent and adaptable, peaceful and pro- lific, the Mkikuyu is the coming man under the altered con- ditions of to-day." Whether the outlook for the Masai is quite so hopeless as the authors think, may perhaps be a matter of opinion. The existence of the sedentary Wakwafi seems to show that they are not entirely incapable of changing their habits-though possibly not while the race remains 1 Mr. Hobley also gives an account (p. 147) of the Kuringa thenge ceremony, which should be compared with Mr. Tate's. 2 See Journal for April, 191o, pp. 290-307.</page><page sequence="12">458 JOURNAL OF THE AFRICAN SCOCIETY unmixed. Also, one asks whether it is quite out of the question to reserve them a sufficiency of grazing ground for a period long enough to tide over the transition from pastoral to agri- cultural life. It is easy to see that the peculiar social system of this people, whatever its origin, and its raison d'etre in the past (had it been nothing more than legalised licence, it would surely have brought about their extinction long ago), spells ruin when brought into contact with civilisation-or rather with such of its products as find their way (like the foam and wreckage on the crest of the tide-wave) into a new country. (See p. 348.) It remains to be seen how the removal of the tribe to the Laikipia plains will affect them as a whole. With one more quotation-selected after balancing between several tempting passages-we must bring our survey of this attractive volume to a close. It occurs on p. 21, where a general summary of Kikuyu character is given. "The Mkikuyu is by nature extraordinarily honest; bright and intelligent, trustful and truthful in contact with one European, he becomes stupid and unreliable, tricky and treacherous to a degree in the hands of another; it all depends on how he is treated. . .. He may be summed up as being exceptionally good native material, but of so plastic a char- acter that if badly handled at the outset it is spoiled permanently. They are naturally polite in their intercourse with one another, and a very definite code of good manners exists. It is the custom for women and children to stand aside for warriors to pass on the path, but the warrior will always yield the road to an old woman. The order kept at all functions is very striking. Even the children, though never harshly treated or spoken to, behave considerately and courteously . . ." It is gratifying to know that we number among our East African officials such men as Messrs. Hollis and Hobley, and others one might name, whio are equally alive to the respon- sibilities and capable of utilising the opportunities of their position. A. WERNER.</page></plain_text>
