<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCAVATIONS AT TORONE, 1990 Alexander Cambitoglou and John K. Papadopoulos Excavations at Torone in Chalkidike were continued in 1990 as a collaboration of the Athens Archaeological Society and the Australian Archaeological Institute at Athens (pis. 15-16).1 The work of the 1990 season was again focused on Promontory 1, known to Thucydides as 'Lekythos',2 and represents a direct continuation of the project begun in 1986 and continued in 1988 and 1989.3 Excavations were conducted in six trenches (TR 61, 62, 63/65, 67/68, 69, and 74), all of which were begun in previous seasons (fig. 1). In addition, the baulk separating TR 61 and 62 from TR 63/65, and that separating TR 63/65 and 67/68, were partially investigated (these are referred to as TR 63/65 SE Baulk and TR 67/68 SE baulk respectively). Trench 61 (figs. 2,9; pis. 17:1-2; 18:1) In TR 61, below the level of the Classical structures first encountered in 1986 and further investigated in 1988 and 1989,4 a complex sequence of deposits was revealed comprising a number of pits and several distinct filling dumps, including a series of ashy refuse dumps which yielded some bone, shell, and other organic debris. The pottery was mixed, including various Bronze Age wares, a good deal of Early Iron Age wheelmade painted pottery, and various fine and coarse wares of Archaic date. The latest identifiable material appeared to be of the Late Archaic period, perhaps extending into Early Classical. An earlier phase was represented by two large storage pithoi, designated Pithoi 1 and 4 (fig. 2; pis. 17: 1-2; 18: 1). Pithos 1, first encountered in 1986,5 was partially damaged by Wall A of the late Byzantine semicircular defensive tower, while the poorly preserved Pithos 4 was largely destroyed by the foundations for the same wall. Although little conclusive evidence for the date of Pithos 4 was preserved, the material associated with Pithos 1 suggests an Early Iron Age date, probably Sub Protogeometric/Late Geometric. Both pithoi were part of a large storage area which also included Pithoi 2 and 3 in the neighbouring TR 62, where excavation to greater depth was possible. Trench 62 (figs. 3-9; pis. 17:1-2; 18: 2) Below the Classical and Archaic levels excavated up to 1989,6 an important stratified sequence from the Late Bronze Age to the Archaic period was uncovered in TR 62. The earliest levels, down to a depth of 5.60 m below datum, were those associated with Wall Ν (fig. 5; pis. 17: 2; 18: 2), only the upper part of which was exposed by the end of the 1990 season. The deposits associated with this wall, and those directly overlying it, yielded Early 1 The expedition to Torone is generously financed by the Australian Research Council, the Australian Archaeological Institute at Athens, and the Foundation for Classical Archaeology of the University of Sydney.

Papadopoulos and Middle Bronze Age pottery in quantity, a few fragments of Early Mycenaean vases (LH I and II),7 and a number of fragments of LH III date, the latest including LH III C. This series of deposits, not yet totally exhausted, has increased significantly our information concerning Torone in the Late Bronze Age. Overlying this Late Bronze Age horizon were the Early Iron Age levels associated with Pithoi 2 and 3, both of which were found in situ and well preserved except for their uppermost parts. The larger Pithos 2 had a preserved height of 1.26 m in the ground, but scattered rim fragments found in the immediate vicinity show that it had an original height of at least 1.50 m and a maximum diameter of 0.74 m. The pithos was subsequently restored and reconstructed; its original height would be close to 2.0 m (pl. 21: 5). The smaller Pithos 3 had a preserved height of 1.25 m in situ. Both vessels are of ovoid form, tapering to narrow bases. Associated with these pithoi was a series of walls designated Walls K, L, and M (figs. 4-6,8); these walls, in part designed as a support for the larger Pithos 2, may have been used, in their original form, as benches. They served the further function of delineating this part of the storage area from those to the SW and NW. Although a good deal of pottery of the Bronze Age was recovered from the various deposits associated with Pithoi 2 and 3 and Walls Κ and L, an Early Iron Age date was established by the large quantity of Sub-Protogeometric/ Late Geometric local painted pottery found, which represents the latest material recovered from these deposits.8 This pottery is stylistically similar to that found in the Early Iron Age potter's kiln uncovered on Terrace V in 1982,9 suggesting a date of c.750-700 bc for this horizon. Only one fragment of Early Iron Age pottery is here illustrated from TR 62, a shoulder fragment of a large closed vessel, probably an amphora (90.146), with a figured representation (fig. 3).10 The deposits associated with Pithoi 2 and 3 in TR 62 and with Pithoi 1 and 4 in TR 61 represent an important Early Iron Age settlement context, which suggests that a substantial part of the promontory may have been given over to storage during this period." Closer study of the associated pottery should establish an important local Chalkidic Geometric style. The excavation of TR 61 and 62 in 1990 revealed more of the interior face of the late Wall A, an elevation of which is shown in fig. 9; the latter replaces that presented in the 1988 report.12 Trench 63/65 (figs. 10-15; pis. 17: 3; 18:3) In TR 63/65 the fill of the large circular cistern, first uncovered in 1986, was completely excavated in 1990.13 The post-Byzantine refuse pit fill which had been partly cut into the earlier fill of the cistern was mostly cleared and described in the reports for previous campaigns.14 The work in this trench in 1990 was largely devoted to clearing the remaining fill, which was shown to have been laid in several stages, most of which were contemporary or near contemporary. The uppermost part of the original remaining fill, first encountered at depths varying between 3.36 and 4.53 m below datum, was largely composed of fragments of worked stone, a large quantity of roof-tile fragments and other architectural terracottas including the sima fragment inv. 90.78 (fig. 13), some coarse-ware pottery, quite a bit of shell, a large quantity of plaster fallen from the internal faces of the cistern,15 and some fine ware pottery, all in an interleaving of loose, dark brown soil.16 At an average depth of 5.05 m below datum a darker, more compact earth was encountered, still containing a large quantity of worked stone, but rather more fine-ware pottery.17 Two fragments of marble sculpture were recovered from the latter (inv. 90.214 and 90.312): one preserving a portion of a human foot (fig. 14), the other part of the lower jaw of an animal, probably a lion (fig. 15). Together, these two deposits yielded well over 100 pieces of worked granodiorite,18 several smaller 7 See further A. Cambitoglou-J. K. Papadopoulos, 'The Earliest Mycenaeans in Macedonia', in: C.

Of the latter, the most important include the fragmentary triglyph inv. 90.649 (fig. 37; pi. 21: 3), four gutta fragments (inv. 90.18, 90.92, 90.215, 90.570),19 a fragment of a column or pilaster preserving fluting (inv. 90.314), and several large blocks preserving lifting channels (including inv. 90.642: fig. 40, and 90.838). In addition, at least 20 large and over 115 smaller worked pieces of poroj-limestone were recovered. The majority of these, if not all, should derive from an early Doric building which must be the temple of Athena mentioned by Thucydides in his account of the battle fought at Torone between the Spartans and Athenians in 424/3 bc as standing on the promontory.20 A large quantity of roof tiles, thought to derive from the temple, were also recovered from the fill, in addition to a few other architectural terracottas such as the sima fragment already mentioned, and a possible but poorly preserved antefix fragment (inv. 90.523).21 These various components of the building, together with a few architectural fragments encountered in neighbouring trenches, provide not only tangible remnants of the Temple of Athena—the location of which on the promontory remains uncertain—but enough information to make possible at least a partial reconstruction of the building on paper. The exact date of the building awaits closer study, but there is little doubt that it was constructed in the course of the Archaic period, making it one of the earliest buildings of the Doric order in Macedonia. The lowest part of the fill of the cistem, first encountered at an average depth of 5.50 m below datum, comprised a pottery smash in an interleaving of dark, moist, silty soil (fig. 10). This deposit22 yielded fragments of several amphorai and at least one large storage pithos mended in antiquity with lead clamps, from which it should be possible to reconstruct a number of complete or near-complete vessels, as well as fragments of other pots. Collectively, these three stages of the filling of the cistern yielded a small quantity of pottery ranging in date from the Early Bronze Age to the Archaic periods and a somewhat larger quantity of Classical pottery. The largest component of pottery recovered was Hellenistic, including a variety of fine-ware pottery such as West Slope and Pergamene wares. Preliminary study of this material would suggest, tentatively, that much of it dates to the 3rd century bc but that the latest identifiable pottery may be of the 1st century BC; it should be noted, however, that closer study may we|l modify this dating. In any case, it would appear fairly certain that the cistern had gone out of use and was filled in during the course of the later Hellenistic period. The cistern itself was therefore earlier, though conclusive stratigraphie evidence for its construction date was not revealed. It is also clear that the Archaic Temple of Athena was in a state of disrepair during the later Hellenistic period and that fragments of its entablature and walls were in sufficient quantity and readily at hand to be used as fill. In two areas where the plaster was not preserved, the masonry of the cistern wall was visible, and here it was possible to determine that it was built of predominantly small to medium schist slabs with flat exterior faces; no mortar bonding was observed. Over the stonework, at least three main layers of plaster were applied: the first being a coarse rendering, a few centimetres thick; the second less coarse, approximately 0.5-1.0 cm thick and coloured pink; the third much finer, with a smooth off-white finish. The two outer layers are largely lost, preserved only in patches on the upper section of the cistem wall; slight traces of a fourth layer were noted in the report for 1989.23 The floor of the cistern slopes gently towards the centre, where there is a central circular depression (figs. 11-12). The floor was finished smooth with a fine pale pink plaster, whereas the thin sloping ledge which marks the junction with the cistern wall was finished with a smooth off-white plaster. Over the pink plaster of the floor a dark red film was observed in certain areas, while a larger portion of the floor surface was covered with a darker reddish brown substance the exact nature of which remains uncertain.24 There are also splashes of off-white plaster on the floor, some of which had run down towards the central floor depression, suggesting that the walls were rendered once the floor had been finished. As can be seen on the section drawings of the cistern (fig. 12), the walls taper slightly towards the top. Trench 63/65 SE Baulk (fig. 16) In this baulk, the post-Byzantine levels were partially investigated with the view of completing an overall plan of the architectural remains of this later period in the area under excavation. It was from these later levels that another large, finely worked /joras-limestone block from the entablature of the Temple of Athena was found (inv. 90.837). The block, part of the cornice (geison), preserves traces of stucco, faint traces of red paint, as well as small circular protrusions where the guttae have broken off; it is here designated Geison Block 1 (fig. 16; pi. 21:1-2). 19 More gutta fragments were encountered in the upper part of the Till of the cistern excavated in previous campaigns, as well as in later levels in neighbouring trenches, see ARepLond 36, 1989-1990, 52-3 figs. 44-5; Meditarch 4, 1991, pi. 23:5. 20IV 116. 21 Also inv. 90.33 and 90.181. 22 Designated Unit 143. 23 Meditarch 4,1991,158. 24 This may prove to be organic, but until analysed its composition remains unidentified.</page><page sequence="4">144 A. Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos Trench 67/68 (figs. 17-22,25; pis. 19:1-3) Work in TR 67/68 was only made possible by the removal of Walls 16,9, and 10 of the small Π-shaped structure excavated and described in 1989.25 Almost directly below the footing of Wall 10, several well-defined mud bricks were exposed; further excavation showed the bricks to be part of a substantial levelling deposit laid in order to raise the ground level to the desired height for the construction of the Π-shaped structure and the associated building represented by Wall 6 (pi. 19: 1-2). The clearance of the Π-shaped structure yielded, as anticipated, pottery largely of the later stages of the Middle Bronze Age, along with a number of other small finds such as the fragment of a terracotta 'spool' L90.05 (fig. 18) and the stone arrowhead inv. 90.100 (fig. 19); the process also showed Wall 6 to be more substantial than previously thought (fig. 17). At least four courses of neatly jointed, though not very regular masonry were exposed along the SW face of the wall. Moreover, the fact that Wall 10 of the Π-shaped structure and Wall 6 were built flush against each other, and that the lowest course of Wall 10 was at a level slightly higher than that of Wall 6, suggests that the Π-shaped structure was a subsidiary architectural unit belonging to the larger building represented thus far by Wall 6. The deposit of mud bricks also extended below the base of Wall 6, as was visible in the scarp, and, consequently, the combined chronological evidence gained in 1989 and 1990 suggests that this building phase may be assigned to the period of transition between the Middle and the Late Bronze Age.26 Two different types of mud brick were noted in the deposit. Below this levelling fill, a number of distinct soil units were recorded which collectively may be assigned to a slightly earlier phase of the Middle Bronze Age. Handmade versions of local grey and brown-red 'Northern Minyan' pottery were common,27 so too a number of thin obsidian flakes. Further excavation revealed the curious deposit of sea-shells first encountered in 1989. This shell midden defined an area just over 2m in length (SE/NW), with the deposit clearly extending to the SW below the Middle Bronze Age Wall 23 and the associated Feature A excavated in 1989. The midden dipped sharply from SE to NW, as well as from SW to NE and was shown to have been retained by a very crudely constructed apsidal retaining wall, designated Feature E. Towards the NE, Feature Ε had cut through the floor surface associated with the earlier Wall 24 thought to be of Early Bronze Age date. Fragments of pottery associated with the midden and the fill immediately overlying it include 90.498 and 90.798 (figs. 20-21). Of these the latter is similar in style to another rim fragment found in the vicinity in 1989.28 Clearance of Feature Ε brought to light the continuation of the floor, partly exposed in 1989, comprising the six small post holes surrounding the circular raised platform thought to be a hearth.29 The pottery stratified directly above and below this surface, including the fragmentary open vessel 90.865 (fig. 22) and the fragment of the small kyathos or ladle 90.925 (fig. 25), appears to be of the Early Bronze Age, but a closer dating will only be possible with further study of the material. Cut into this surface were at least two, and possibly three, more post holes, bringing the total number of post holes associated with this surface to eight or nine (pi. 19:3). Their exact function remains uncertain, though they must have belonged to some wooden feature located in this central part of the area under excavation. Clearance of part of this surface quickly revealed an earlier floor into which were cut three more small post holes (pi. 19: 3). Clearance of this earlier surface brought to light another deposit of mud bricks which further excavation showed to be levelling fill laid in order to raise the ground level to the desired height for the construction of Wall 24 and its associated floors. The bricks were largely decayed and most had decomposed into amorphous spreads. Associated pottery was of the Early Bronze Age. Clearance of this deposit of mud bricks revealed an earlier surface characterized by a hard-packed clay of various colours, associated with which were streaks of carbon. The deposits below the level of this earlier floor were not fully explored; three stones partly exposed near the NW scarp of the area under excavation may define a possible, though far from certain, earlier wall. The associated material in these lower levels represents an earlier phase of the Early Bronze Age, but it is clear that the depth of deposits continues in the area and further excavation here may reveal even earlier phases of occupation. In any case, the excavation of TR 67/68 in 1990 has revealed an important, well stratified, sequence from the Early Bronze Age through various phases of the Middle Bronze Age. Trench 67/68 SE Baulk (figs. 23-24,26-27; pi. 18: 3) Work in this baulk was confined to exploring the Classical and post-Classical deposits. A number of late, post Byzantine, walls were uncovered, completing the plan of the late architectural remains of this part of the area. 25 Meditarch 4,1991,159-164, especially fig. 15, pi. 22: 2-3. 26 See further Cambitoglou-Papadopoulos art. cit.

These include the post-Byzantine Pit 4 of TR 67, the large Byzantine Pit 6 of TR 68, and the similarly large TR 67/68 Pit 7, which was probably dug and filled in during the course of the 4th century bc. Minor cleaning of the Classical deposits associated with TR 67 Wall 20 brought to light the fragment of the 'face lid' inv. 90.322 (fig. 23), which looks very similar to Trojan anthropomorphic lids of the Early Bronze Age.30 The piece was clearly out of original context, having been found in a Classical deposit which yielded much material of earlier date. Also found out of original context were the following inventoried pieces: inv. 90.434, L90.15,90.107 (figs. 24,26-27). Trench 69 (figs. 28-33; pis. 18:4; 20:1-2) The removal of Walls 7 and 8 of the Late Roman or Early Byzantine tomb uncovered in 1986 permitted the continuation of excavation in TR 69.31 The primary aim was to expose further the important Early Bronze Age burnt dwelling excavated in 1986 comprising a floor surface onto which a number of timber roof beams and battens had collapsed.32 A solitary carbon sample from these beams submitted for C14 dating indicated a date of 2170-1675 bc,33 and a supplementary aim of excavation in this trench was to collect more samples for C14 dating in order to test the date established on the basis of the material recovered in 1986. Three separate carbon samples collected and analysed from this horizon in the course of the 1990 campaign were all dated to the first half of the 3rd millennium bc (calibrated).34 Clearance of Walls 7 and 8 brought to light the continuation of the foundation trench for the Late Classical/Early Hellenistic Wall 9 (fig. 29). The fragment of a Bronze Age 'striated-ware' vessel (inv. 90.60) was recovered from this fill (fig. 28).35 The foundation trench was dug into a series of deposits which yielded primarily pottery and other small finds of the Early and Middle Bronze Age, but with the latest material dating to the Archaic period. Clearance of these deposits revealed, more fully, Wall 14, associated with which were the remnants of a floor surface and a hearth composed of several layers of clay burnt hard (pi. 20:1). Among the pottery associated with the hearth was the near complete vessel inv. 90.191 (fig. 30), thought to date to the period of transition from the Early to the Middle Bronze Age. Towards the east, a pit filled with stones and ashy debris may have been the fire pit of the hearth. Below the level of the hearth a complex series of deposits was encountered, including a number of cuttings which had been dug into the levelling fill on which Wall 14 was constructed. Each of these was dug and recorded separately and a fuller account of the stratigraphie relationship of one deposit to another will only be possible once all the material recovered has been more closely studied. The following inventoried pieces derive from these deposits: 90.575, 90.1312, and 90.1314 (figs. 30-32). These deposits also yielded fragments of what appeared to be clay facings, conceivably from clay used in roofing. They also yielded a good number of ground and flaked stone implements including pounders (inv. S90.06, 90.270), burnishing tools (90.84, S90.10, S90.ll, 90.234), a grinder (90.310), an obsidian blade (90.271), and an obsidian core (90.459).36 It was also from one of the deposits below the hearth that the one-handled vessel with three nipples inv. 90.178 was found (fig. 33); it is tentatively assigned as contemporary to inv. 90.191 (fig. 30). Clearance of Wall 14 and of the underlying features associated with the deposits further to the east yielded more material of the Early Bronze Age and of the early stages of the Middle Bronze Age. Further excavation of the deposits below the hearth revealed, and partially exposed, two walls, designated Walls 15 and 16 (fig. 29). Both are associated with the Early Bronze Age burnt dwelling first encountered in 1986. The excavation of 1990 showed that the burnt and collapsed timber beams extended further to the east and that more of them were preserved. At least six beams were exposed under which was a set of parallel battens (fig. 29; pis. 18: 4; 20: 2). 30 Cf. Troy, Mycenae, Tiryns, Orchomenos.

Fuller details of the C14 dates will be presented elsewhere. 35 The fragment is of interest because of the striations CBesenstriche) set vertically and diagonally on its preserved exterior face. Striated ware, sometimes referred to as 'scored ware' (e.g. C. W. Blegen et al., Troy I, General Introduction. The First and Second Settlements [1950] 53-4 with full discussion), occurs commonly, but rarely in great quantities, at a number of Early Bronze Age sites in Macedonia, Thessaly, north-west Anatolia and elsewhere.

Papadopoulos, 'The Bronze Age Potter', in: Torone I (forthcoming). 36 Other stone tools recovered from Trench 69 include: 90.26, 90.180, 90.423, 90.455, 90.424, 90.500, 90.576, 90.569, 90.754, 90.789, 90.826, 90.352, 90.398, 90.582, 90.827, 90.828.</page><page sequence="6">146 A. Cambitoglou and J. Κ. Papadopoulos Individual battens were shown to be more substantial than was first thought in 1986.37 An interesting discovery, made late in the season, was the bones of a human infant or baby in the collapse immediately above the floor. A portion of the skull was recovered but the greater part of the skeleton extended below the Late Classical/Early Hellenistic Wall 9. Carbonized seeds were also found in the immediate vicinity of the skull. Although it was not possible to expose the remains of the infant totally, it seemed clear that this was not a burial as the bones lay immediately above the floor, not in a pit, immediately below the collapsed roof beams. The excavation of TR 69 has brought to light a good deal of well-stratified prehistoric material which has especially shed light on the later stages of the Early Bronze Age and the early stages of the Middle Bronze Age. Trench 74 (figs. 34-36; pis. 20: 3; 21:4) TR 74 was first excavated in 1989 and was located towards the northern end of the promontory in order to test the nature of occupation in a part of it at some distance from the main excavation area to the SE (figs. 1,35).38 During the 1989 season, the majority of deposits excavated were associated with a series of post-Byzantine walls of various phases, as well as a number of pits cutting at least a metre below topsoil into earlier levels. Redeposited finds were very mixed, dating from the Early Bronze Age to the post-Byzantine era. By the end of the 1989 season the W/NW half of the trench had been excavated down to bedrock, with intrusive post-Byzantine activity evident throughout the complete stratified sequence. During the 1990 season excavation was concentrated in the E/SE sector of the trench, where some survival of undisturbed occupation deposits was revealed, with Bronze Age surfaces lying directly on bedrock. The only structural features uncovered predating those of the post-Byzantine era were a series of poorly preserved, or only partially exposed, wall lines that were either so highly robbed out, or else visible to such a small extent that little can be said about them apart from orientation. Associated deposits, however, would suggest that these walls represent the poorly preserved structural remains of the Classical or Hellenistic period. The most important sealed deposits were, first of all, a levelling fill laid in order to create a built-up surface over much of the eastern portion of the trench, where the bedrock dipped sharply—although containing much pottery of the Bronze Age and some material of the Early Iron Age, the latest identifiable pottery associated with this fill was of the Classical or Hellenistic period; secondly, small preserved patches of Bronze Age occupation surfaces, lying directly on bedrock. The most substantial of these, located near the NNE corner of the trench, comprised a pottery smash overlying a thin clay surface, which produced a number of well-preserved vessels of the Early Bronze Age, including inv. 90.983 and 90.1109 (figs. 34,36).39 Elsewhere in the trench fragments of Bronze Age pottery, such as inv. 90.260 (fig. 36), were also found directly above bedrock. Perhaps the most impressive find, located approximately half-way along the south scarp of the trench, was a large storage pithos similar to those uncovered in TR 61 and 62, but set upright in a deep cutting in bedrock (fig. 35; pi. 21: 4). This cutting, averaging about 1.15m in diameter, was dug to a depth of t.1.20 m, following almost exactly the shape of the pithos (pis. 20: 3; 21: 4). The pithos was wedged up against the north side of the cutting and the greatest gap between pot and bedrock, to the south and east, was never more than 10 cm. The base and approximately two-thirds of the body of the pithos were preserved, standing 1.20 m tall in situ. Although a considerable depth of mixed dumped fills had built up over the pithos after abandonment, deposits contemporary to the pithos suggested an Early Iron Age date for it—Sub-Protogeometric or Late Geometric—contemporary with the pithoi in TR 61 and 62. The deposits dating the pithos in TR 74 comprised the primary fill, with high organic content,40 in the bottom 15 cm of the vessel, as well as the primary backfill of the pithos pit. The latter could hardly have contained intrusive material on account of the close relationship between the vessel and the edges of the pit. The pottery recovered from the primary backfill of the pit included worn sherds of Bronze Age date and a number of better preserved fragments of the Sub-Protogeometric or Late Geometric period. The discovery of this pithos suggests that not only the SE part of the promontory, but a larger part of it was given over to storage in the Early Iron Age. Summary and concluding remarks As anticipated, the prehistoric deposits excavated in 1990 yielded important finds, supplementing considerably those from previous seasons. This was so particularly in TR 67/68, where an important stratified sequence from the earlier stages of the Early Bronze 37 Meditarch 1,1988,210-12. 38 Meditarch 4,1991,169-71. 39 90.983 was found on the actual surface and 90.1109 in the build-up immediately above. 40 This awaits to be analysed.</page><page sequence="7">Excavations at Torone, 1990 147 Age, through the Middle Bronze Age, to the period of transition with the Late Bronze Age was revealed. Excavations in the neighbouring TR 69 further exposed the Early Bronze Age burnt dwelling first encountered in 1986, comprising sets of burnt and collapsed timber roof beams fallen onto the floor of the building. Closer study of the material recovered from these deposits, coupled with C14 dates, will establish an important chronological sequence for a site in this part of coastal central Macedonia. Considerable quantities of Bronze Age pottery and other small finds were also encountered in later deposits, out of original context. Among this material special mention may be made of additional fragments of imported Mycenaean pottery of the LH I and II phases, which represents the earliest Mycenaean pottery found in Macedonia, and supplementing the small quantity of such pottery recovered in earlier seasons. Mention may also be made of the small fragment of a 'face-lid' of Early Bronze Age date of a type rarely found outside the Troad (fig. 23); the piece appears to be of local manufacture. The two most exciting finds of the 1990 season were, however, the discovery of undisturbed Early Iron Age settlement contexts, and of fragments of the Temple of Athena found in the fill of the large Hellenistic cistern and elsewhere. The deposits associated with three massive storage pithoi in TR 61/62 towards the SE end of the promontory uncovered in previous seasons were further explored in 1990. Excavation here revealed a fourth pithos, and stratified contexts suggesting a Late Geometric date for the pithoi (c.750-700 bc). Unexpectedly, a fifth storage pithos was found in situ at the northern end of the promontory in TR 74, of contemporary date, and it would appear that a large area of the promontory was devoted to storage during this period. The discovery of these pithoi was particularly significant in view of the fact that evidence for settlement in this period is rare in the Aegean generally. The discovery adds considerable knowledge to that of the earlier 'Submycenaean' and Protogeometric cemetery on Terrace V excavated in 1981-1984 and of the Late Geometric potter's kiln uncovered in 1982.41 The combined evidence of the cemetery, the kiln, and now the settlement on Promontory 1, shows that Torone was an important Early Iron Age site, and has further established the existence of a thriving local school of pottery, hitherto unknown, of the Submycenaean, Protogeometric, and Geometric periods. In Book IV 116 of his history of the Peloponnesian war, Thucydides refers to a Temple of Athena which stood on the 'Lekythos' at Torone. Although the foundations of this temple were not encountered in the trenches excavated on the promontory since 1986, evidence for the existence of the temple and the cult of Athena was obtained from a potsherd inscribed with the name of the goddess,42 as well as several architectural terracottas thought to derive from the building. In 1990, the excavation of the fill of the large cistern first uncovered in 1986, and further dug in 1988 and 1989, was completed. The cistern itself proved to be larger and better preserved than was originally anticipated. Its circular wall was carefully rendered with a number of coatings of plaster; its floor was finished smooth with a fine pale pink plaster and there is a sloping ledge which marks the junction of floor and cistern wall, which is finished with a smooth off-white plaster. Preliminary study of the pottery and other small finds recovered from the fill suggests, tentatively, that the cistern went out of use and was filled in sometime during the late Hellenistic period, perhaps the 1st century bc. It was mainly from this fill that many large, well-worked blocks of poros-limestone were recovered, a few 41 J. Κ.

Κ. Papadopoulos of which preserved traces of painted stucco. Of these, the most important include the triglyph inv. 90.649 (fig. 37; pi. 21: 3), several gutta fragments,43 and a fragment of a column or pilaster preserving fluting (90.314). Two fragmentary blocks preserving cuttings are illustrated here (figs. 37,39). In addition to these was the large geison block uncovered in TR 63/65 SE Baulk, 90.837 (fig. 16; pi. 21:1-2). These pieces should all be from an early Doric building which must be the Temple of Athena mentioned by Thucydides. A large quantity of roof tiles, thought to derive from the temple, was also recovered from the fill, in addition to a few other architectural terracottas. These various components of the building show it to be one of the earliest Doric temples in Macedonia and corroborate the importance of Torone during this period.44 Postscript During the summer of 1992 the decision was taken to remove a large poros-limestone block built into the semicircular Wall A of the Byzantine tower in TR 61/62. The block, located toward the lower stretches of the wall (fig. 9), was first uncovered in 1986,45 and is of particular interest since the worked face, preserving anathyrosis, presented along the interior of Wall A has an inscribed vau or digamma, almost certainly a mason's mark. The block proved to be part of a cornice and was designated Geison Block 2 (figs. 38,41-42), though its dimensions were different to those of Geison Block 1 uncovered in TR 63/65 SE Baulk (fig. 16). The fact that it was built into Wall A saved it from subsequent ravages and although its surfaces were worn, remains of painted stucco were far better preserved than similar fragments and blocks found elsewhere. A portion of the tainia was exceptionally well preserved, decorated with a painted meander pattern (figs. 38,41,42). 43 See especially Meditarch 3, 1990, 126 fig. 23; Meditarch 4,1991, pi. 23:5; ARepLond 36,1989-1990, 53 fig. 45. 44 See RE VI A 2 (1937) 1795-8 s.v.
