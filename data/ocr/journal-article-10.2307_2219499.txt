<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Coherence of Theism. By RICHARD SWINBURNE. (Oxford: Clarendon Press. 1977. Pp. 302. Price ?9.00.) This is an important book. It concerns itself with the questions whether theism is "coherent" (i.e., entails no contradictions), and whether and how we can grasp the meaning of theistic claims. Swinburne attempts to say something about every topic which arises in connection with these main themes. This was probably right, but has led to some unevenness. Swinburne's thesis is that traditional theistic claims, if they do not include the claim that God is a necessary being, are demonstrably coherent (and intelligible), but that if, as is normal, they do include the claim about necessity, they may be coherent but cannot be shown to be. (But if we can show that they are probably true, we thereby show that they are probably coherent.) Swinburne argues for the coherency and intelligibility of the notion of a contingent God by, in general, spelling out what would be involved in my being omnipresent, disembodied, perfectly free, and the like. This involves him in the discussion of such topics as personal identity, personal versus scientific explanation, and the objectivity of moral judgements. On some of these matters he is more convincing than on others.</page><page sequence="2">186 BOOK REVIEWS Certain of the properties traditionally ascribed to God, primarily omnipotence, require special treatment to show that they can be coherently predicated. Swinburne deals with omnipotence by maintaining that '. .. is omnipotent' is tensed. An omnipotent being can, but need not, make something which he cannot thereafter do what he likes with (free creatures are a case in point). If he does, he is not thereafter fully omnipotent, but this is by his own choice. A similar treatment of omniscience allows God not to know his own future free choices, in so far as these are not determined by moral con- siderations, nor the free choices of any free beings he may create. Why is a necessary God not demonstrably a coherent supposition? The answer involves Swinburne's theory of meaning. Roughly, some words are meaningful to start with, in that they have established uses. Other words can be introduced by rules relat- ing their use to that of established words ("syntactic" rules), and by citing paradigms of what they are to be applied to ("semantic" rules). A word is thus rendered meaning- ful. We can give to a meaningful word an "analogical" sense by loosening up its semantic rules, together with whatever syntactic rules we have to relax in order to allow the analogical sense to cover what we want. We loosen up semantic rules for 'W' when we say that it can be applied, not only to what closely resembles paradigm W things, but also to what resembles paradigm W things more closely than it resembles paradigm non-Ws. A blind man's use of 'loud' and 'soft' to cover visual properties that he believes to exist would be an example. This would involve the semantic loosen- ing of these words, and would involve dropping the syntactic rule that what is loud can be heard (though we could have the syntactic rule that what is analogically loud can be analogically heard). A further example would be the physicists' doctrine that light is waves (but not therefore not particles) and also particles (but not therefore not waves). Here '. .. is waves' must say of its subject not that it resembles waves as closely as they resemble each other, but only that it resembles waves more closely than it resembles paradigm non-waves. Swinburne holds that words are used analogically outside theology (as in these examples), and may also be used sparingly within it. But, when we use words analogically, we no longer know what can be derived from sentences containing them. Next we need the concept of what X miniessentially is, or of X's miniessential kind. This is the narrowest kind to which X must continue to belong if X is to continue to be. Thus if you hold that a car can become a van, but not a cube of scrap, you evidently do not hold that a car is miniessentially a car, but rather (perhaps) that it is mini- essentially a motor-vehicle. A being, next, which exists at all times past, present and future, and which at all times has the properties traditionally ascribed to God, can be called a p.g.b. or personal ground of being. Now God (if he exists) is certainly a p.g.b. But, Swinburne holds, theism traditionally claims that he is also miniessentially a p.g.b., or that it is incoherent to suppose that he might at any time lack, or surrender, any of his properties; he possesses his divine powers inalienably. But he is also claimed to be a person, and any person we can conceive of is such that it is coherent to suppose he might lose certain of his powers. Swinburne detects a contradiction here; God cannot be both miniessentially a p.g.b., and thus possess his powers inalienably, and also a person, and thus possess his powers not inalienably. (I am a little suspicious of the alleged contradiction.) He holds that the contradiction can only be resolved by allow- ing that 'person' is used analogically of God; what we claim is only that he resembles paradigm persons more closely than he resembles paradigm non-persons. The ana- logical loosening of 'person' carries with it the analogical loosening of the other terms which we use in spelling out God's properties. This is why full-blooded traditional theism is not demonstrably coherent. There is much to be learnt from this intricate and closely packed book, and much to quarrel with in it. I shall begin with a pedantic point, which may have more behind it. Swinburne sometimes writes as if traditional theism is demonstrably coherent in</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 187 all its articles except for the article of God's necessary being; but what he really holds, I think, is that, whereas a theism which lacks this article is demonstrably coherent, traditional theism, since it includes this article, is not. For the inclusion of this article requires the analogical loosening-up of 'person' and of all terms syntactically related to it ('knows', 'chooses', 'forgives' and the like). But when a sentence contains an analogically loosened expression we cannot demonstrate that the proposition which it expresses is coherent. But, in Swinburne's sense of 'coherent', why not? Now it is easy to see one peril to which we are exposed if we have to allow that terms are used of God analogically. This is that we risk becoming unable to say how God differs from Spinoza's Deus sive natura or from a Platonic anima mundi. For if what we are saying of God is that he as-it-were knows, chooses and the like, then it can be replied that the universe as-it-were knows what natural laws it imposes on its parts and the disposition of those parts, that it as-it-were chooses what shall come about, and so on. If we could reply: "Yes, but God knows and chooses very much as you and I do", we should have explained how God differs from the universe-but this reply is barred to us if God is only analogically a person. However, what I do not see is how it is that analogical loosening-up renders impossible a demonstration of coherence; on the contrary, I should have thought it made it, in Swinburne's sense of 'coherence', all too easy. For p is coherent iff p does not entail a contradiction. Now what happens when we loosen up a term is, surely, not that we do not know any longer what is entailed by its use, but that we do know that very little is entailed by its use. For we have rendered the term itself, and its syntactically related terms, too flabby, so to speak, to be able to generate many entailments. If something closely resembles paradigm waves, having their common nature, then we can conclude it is not a particle; if it is only nearer in nature to paradigm waves than to paradigm non-waves, then neces- sarily it is not a paradigm particle, but it may be an analogical particle. If all terms used of God suffer analogical loosening, how can there be incompatibilities between them? How can an analogical claim about God contradict an evident truth about the world? The risk seems to be, not that we are contradicting ourselves, but that we are saying nothing. It is open to somebody to say that theism is nothing but atheism wearing analogically the anthropomorphic robes of traditional piety. It looks almost as if Swinburne has an unofficial sense of 'coherent' according to which to say that theism may possibly be incoherent is to say that we cannot specify exactly what propositions are conveyed by the sentences in which we express it, and cannot therefore bo sure that we are describing a state of affairs which is possible in accordance with our beliefs about what the nature of things permits. I associate this with Swinburne's relative neglect, as it seems to me, of ontological modality. His account of God's necessary being is (i) that God exists at all times, and (ii) that God is miniessentially a p.g.b. As far as I can see (pp. 243-8) the truth-value of an instance of 'X is miniessentially an A' is a matter of choice. If it sometimes happened that an alligator-bodied thing at t2 had continuity of character and memory with a human-bodied thing, say Jones, at earlier tl, then we could say that Jones had become an alligator, or we could refuse to say this. If we chose to say that Jones was miniessentially an animate being, this would be to permit the former; choosing to say that he was mini- essentially a homo sapiens would register our intention of not permitting it. It is a matter of what entailments we choose to associate with our use of personal names such as 'Jones'. In 'X is miniessentially an A' the predicate gives the sense of the referring expression in the subject-place. The formula lays down that 'X' is to be understood as effecting a reference only to an A. In that case 'God is miniessentially a p.g.b.' says that 'God' is to be taken as the name only of the personal ground of being (if there is one). But then God's necessary being seems to amount to this: that there is at all times a being with certain properties. For that God is miniessentially a p.g.b. adds only that it is incoherent to suppose that what 'God' refers to (assuming it effects a</page><page sequence="4">188 BOOK REVIEWS reference) ever lacks these properties. But what generates this incoherence is not that certain of these properties are such that it would be contradictory to suppose that a being might have them at some times but not at others; what generates the incoherence is not something about God, but something about 'God'-viz., that we withhold this name from anything which at any time lacks these properties. But surely this is an inadequate account of God's necessity. One who says that 'Jones is a homo sapiens' is a necessary truth may not intend thereby to indicate that anything which is not a homo sapiens is not to count as a temporal phase of Jones. He may mean that the nature of things does not permit the thing to which he uses 'Jones' to refer to exist in any form but human embodiment. He may mean, not that, if Jones' personal contin- uity outruns his corporeal continuity, it will be out of line with his use of personal names to call this corporeally discontinuous thing 'Jones', but that the nature of things is such that in no combination of factors will Jones' personal continuity outrun his corporeal continuity. To the theist what determines what ontologically can or cannot be is the divine nature; and nothing determines the divine nature. God's necessary being is, therefore, not so much a case of what must be, as the source of everything that must be; God's necessary being is his ultimacy, or his infinitude. This is ontological modality, and it has little to do with what can and cannot be coherently supposed. A finite intelligence, ignorant of God's nature, can coherently (i.e., non-contradictorily) suppose many things about God, including things which are inconsistent with God's nature, and which therefore cannot be (for example that he is omni-temporal, or that he is timeless, one of which must be inconsistent with God's nature and hence impossible). God's nature, as Swinburne himself says, is the ultimate brute fact, simply because there is nothing on which God depends. This seems to me to get nearer to the tra- ditional understanding of God's necessary being than Swinburne's account. This comprehensive and closely argued book is essential reading in the philosophy of religion, and should start many controversies. In some cases I think it would have been wiser not to attempt a short treatment of a matter which there is no space to argue properly (the thirty pages on the main issues in moral philosophy, for example); in other places I think Swinburne has been unnecessarily intricate; space saved here might perhaps have been used to make the discussion of necessity easier reading. And there are more misprints than the Clarendon Press used to let through. But all in all this is an admirable book. I. M. CROMBIE</page></plain_text>
