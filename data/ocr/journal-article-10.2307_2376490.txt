<plain_text><page sequence="1">POST-KANTIAN IDEALISM AND THE QUESTION OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY. J. W. SCOTT. THE Idealistic thought of the early nineteenth cen- tury undertook the vindication of the spiritual rights of man, intellectual, moral, aesthetic, and religious. Yet the Idealism directly descended from it is accused, on all sides, of having neglected man's higher interests, especially his religious and moral interests. I wish here to treat one aspect of this general charge. It was accen- tuated by Professor James so long ago as 1899, and has rather gained than lessened in popularity since. It is to the effect that the idealistic account of human freedom does not satisfy the moral consciousness. The charge arises, really, from the large grace which idealism has shown towards the scientific demand for law and uniformity. It may be put thus: If the universe be what idealism allows that it is, an unbroken manifesta- tion of law throughout, can any justification be given to the ordinary man for assuming any longer that he is a free and responsible being? To put the issue in this sharp way brings into view one of the first conditions of an answer. It depends on what exactly the common man assumes. To decide this is our first task. We are apt to forget that there is any preliminary question of this kind. We are apt to think that all we need is the common man 's report of what his own assumption is,-that that is bound to be correct. If</page><page sequence="2">330 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. we do, we may very well find ourselves trying to justify an assumption which has no meaning in it, and, in fact, a good deal of confusion has got into the subject from this source. We require first to formulate in an intelligible way that which the ordinary moral consciousness con- tains on this matter; having done so, we can ask whether or not it is true, or consistent with an idealistic view of the world. If we ask the ordinary man what he means by being free and responsible, he may not be able easily to say. But if we put before him the view that 'responsibility implies the possibility of real choice, ' he could almost certainly be got to subscribe to it. He would admit without much hesitation that he was responsible for an action only if he had a choice in the doing of it; and, negatively, that he was not responsible for a thing if he verily couldn't help it. His criterion seems to be, "ICould I, on such and such an occasion, have done anything else than I did? If so, I am responsible for what I chose to do; if not, I am not responsible. " Such a deposition seems to be all we require; and the testing of the adequacy of the idealistic account of it, to be a matter of plain sailing. We have only to ask whether it is possible for any theory which maintains that the universe is an orderly whole, to maintain also that a human agent 'could have helped' any of his doings. Is it possible for him to say truthfully at the end of any action whatsoever, "I could have done otherwise?" It is commonly believed that an affirmative answer to this is possible on a pluralistic view of the world, but on no other. For real choice to be possible, there must be a certain looseness in the constitution of things. Events must not follow rigidly a predestined course. They must admit of accidental deviations of which the agent may take advantage, in order to turn them according to his will; otherwise he goes simply with the stream. I am confident that if the matter be thought out, this 'possibility of real choice' will be found to be admissible</page><page sequence="3">POST-KANTIAN IDEALISM. 331 neither on a pluralistic scheme of the universe nor on any other, but to be an inherent absurdity which cannot even be clearly supposed to be true. The hypothesis only re- quires to be strictly taken. It rests on an imagined experiment. Suppose, it is said that a moral agent is set back for a second time into the critical moment of choice,-say, e. g., that Eve is placed again in Paradise and given another chance,-in that case, even if the cir- cumstances are exactly repeated, it will be possible for her to resist the temptation, instead of yielding to it. Not, I submit, if we are thorough with the experiment. Do but really repeat the circumstances; make it the same day and hour, the same scene and the same tempter. Above all, let it be the same Eve. Let just those innate proclivi- ties which operated before operate again; let them be played upon by solicitations which exactly repeat the previous ones,-the same in number and hue, the same in intensity and power and degree of prevalence,-and the action will be the same, inevitably. Inevitably, because by the time the 'circumstances,' outward and inward, are fully repeated, the act is already done. That the issue should be different in the two instances is unthinkable. It splits itself on an impossibility, the impossibility of draw- ing any line between the mind and the act which comes out of it. The nature of mind does not permit of such a thing. Mind is what it does, and is nothing else. The being and the doing are inseparable. To do a different thing is to be so far a different person. To say with Pro- fessor James,' that the ego which elected to follow one path could, under an exact repetition of the situation, choose to follow another, means that the same ego could be two different beings at once. Freedom which depends on this is not merely contradictory to the faith of Science; it is incompatible with the very conditions of thought. The ordinary man's assertion, then, that in the same circumstances he 'could have done other than he did' :'Will to Believe," p. 155.</page><page sequence="4">332 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. crumbles away when we try to think it. What, then, is the inference? That the moral assumption which this statement tries to express is devoid of basis? That is possible. It is possible also, however, that the state- ment in question does not tell us what the common man's assumption was, but only what he thought it was. And before we write him down as deluded in believing his con- science, we shall do well to recognize that his interpreta- tion of his own mind is as liable to error as his interpreta- tion of anything else; and to try to read, if we can, not only his statements but his actions and his life, and see on what intelligible assumption, if any, his moral conduct seems to be really based. We may find at the root of it a conviction which really has a meaning, of which, we can ask whether it is true or false, and whether it is con- sistent with an idealistic scheme of thought. There is plenty of material for such an investigation. Every day the ordinary individual recognizes merit and demerit, passes judgment on thoughts and actions, his own and those of others. We have to find the criterion which, whether quite consciously or not, he really uses in distin- guishing what deserves praise or blame from what does not. We must seek the common mark attaching to all those actions for which the naive moral consciousness holds the doer accountable. If we keep to straightforward cases, I believe the an- swer to this question to be simple. The naive mind holds a man responsible for what he himself did; it relieves him of responsibility (or of credit) for whatever some other person or agent did. To take an example or two at hazard: a person would not ordinarily credit a lazy pupil with being very industrious if work was only extracted from him by terror of the master's ferrule. He would assign the credit of such work to the person who really did it; that is, if to anybody, to the master. To the boy would go the credit of having dodged the punishment. The reveling young swell, in Dr. Johnson's story, takes to amusing himself pelting an old beggar on the head with</page><page sequence="5">POST-KANTIAN IDEALISM. 333 missiles.; running short of ammunition he continues the process with crown-pieces of which he has too many. The beggar afterwards picks them up. That man, according to the apostle of common sense, was to have no credit for relieving the poor man's necessities. Naturally. What the youth did was to amuse himself after a certain fashion, and for that he must have credit or blame. The relief to the beggar came not from him, but from the kind Heaven which put such missiles so luckily in his way. Or, to take Sir Leslie Stephen's lucid example: if I am in- duced to sign a malicious libel by having a pistol pointed at my head, I am not responsible. Why?' Because the act was strictly not mine, but that of the desperado who threatened me. What I did was to save my life, at the cost of a certain sacrifice of principle. For that alone I am responsible. So it is, I am persuaded, in all clear cases. Infinite complications can, of course, be made by varying the strength of the inducement to do wrong and the gravity of the wrong. And in real life it might be sufficiently difficult to determine truly the amount of re- sponsibility implied. But even under such complications, I think that though the application of the principle may be difficult, the principle itself is clear. I am responsible for an act if I did it, and where other forces came in, for as much of it as I did. This way of looking at the matter, which I believe, to be just to the moral consciousness, has the great advantage that it stakes the case for freedom upon a simple and in- telligible question. When I am held responsible for an act, it is assumed that I was really the doer of it. Is this, then, ever true? Or to put the question as we have it before us in this paper: If the scientific assumption of law be granted, is it possible to maintain, in the last resort, that 'I' ever really do anything? There is one way of understanding the postulate of science, which shuts out the possibility of genuine con- scious agency from the beginning. That is the view which denies the reality of the conscious or spiritual</page><page sequence="6">334 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. world,-the view conveniently designated as naturalism or materialism. To see precisely where idealism parts company with this view, is to see what its conception of a freedom consistent with natural law at bottom is. Materialism is in essence the premature apotheosis of a special method of inquiry. It is the momentary delu- sion of science as it emerges triumphant from its long war with anthropomorphism, and drunk with its ownv success. A long conflict between the assumption of science and a rival assumption has issued in favor of the former. The long cherished idea that there was room in the universe here and there for an active principle or power or force over which the laws of the natural order had no dominion, has been forced again and again to yield to the opposite view, namely, that the laws of the universe admit of no exceptions anywhere. The last point where such an inde- pendence of the natural order was supposed to be surely visible, was in the conscious will of man. But by taking sufficient account of his physical nature, nurture, and en- vironment, it had seemed possible to reduce even him to a mere manifestation of natural forces. His so-called free spirit is but nature's own power flowing through a mar- velously complex channel. Her laws become here infinitely subtle and difficult to trace. But there is no evidence to prove that they are ever anywhere broken. And not only is the universality of order emphasized by this doc- trine, but also the kind of order. With all its infinite com- plexity, the law which nature follows is mechanical. Whatever variety of aspect we may seem to see in nature or in ourselves, there is nothing real except the orderly movement of material atoms. An emotion or purpose is only the physical process out of which it comes,-the process which we could see, could we see the complete physical being of the person whose purpose it is. Sim- ilarly, the action in which such a purpose issues is a strictly physical change. It is the physical condition in which the foregoing physical conditions issued, according to the same laws which govern mechanical movement</page><page sequence="7">POST-KANTIAN IDEALISM. 335 everywhere. On such a view it cannot be true that man does anything. He himself is not anything. He dis- appears. In his place, there is a body mechanically moved. The universe, again, is equally impoverished. It is but the infinitely larger mechanism of which man's body is a part. On such a view there is no human agency. All that is ever done is to give the atoms a new distribu- tion. All that ever does it is the distribution which went before. Now, what is there in this familiar story that idealism, notwithstanding its interest in freedom, has accepted and welcomed? This, I think: that in the end, nothing is ever done in the universe but the universe itself does it, and does it by working in accordance with its own laws. And what, in the materialistic scheme, does idealism contro- vert? The seemingly necessary inference, that therefore man does not really do any of his own actions. How is it possible to reconcile the second of these positions with the first? Is it possible at all ? There is no way of getting an answer except by facing all the intricacies of an epistemological inquiry. For this is the kind of problem to which we have come. But if we do it, we shall probably find the answer both unam- biguous and sufficient. For in the end, the idealism which regards the universe as an ultimate order finds the evi- dence for freedom in this; not that the natural order leaves room for it merely, but that the order itself de- pends on it. Without it there could be no natural order. We must now try to make good this statement. We are almost surprised that modern idealism, with the interests of the higher life at heart, should dare to be so generous to science as it is. Our surprise would lessen, did we recollect that that idealism was itself in the first in- stance an attempt to defend science. Kant, as is well known, wanted to defend the moral postulate of freedom, with its correlatives, God and immortality. But he had other threads to his metaphysical web. He wished, and in the first place, to defend the validity of scientific thought. Vol. XX.-No. 3. 22</page><page sequence="8">336 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. It is an integral part of his undertaking to show that the laws of nature which science seeks, really prevail in nature. But he did it in such a way as to emancipate mind at the same stroke. He did it by pointing out for the first time clearly, that laws of nature are the charac- ter of mind; and the reason why they must prevail in nature is, that a nature which mind can know must bear the character of mind on its face. Laws, then, are at root mind's essence. At first glance, of course, they seem to have nothing to do with mind. They are characteristics of the natural order. They are the great binding uni- formities whereby the world is the world and without which it would all fall loose. But essentially they are also the binding conceptions whereby the mind is the mind and without which it would fall asunder. They must, there- fore, characterize everything which the mind can know. Their universal validity is proved by their source. Their derivation from mind makes them universal for all objects of mind. The fact-that this spells freedom for the spirit of man appears when we ask a further question. In what pre- cise sense are those laws the 'essence' or 'character' of mind? Why do we say that they are the expression of mind at all? The answer (and on it the whole idealistic conception of freedom turns) is that they are something which mind does; a labor which it undertakes and exe- cutes; and in executing that labor it is free. The free activity of mind is what makes the natural order possible. This assumption has at first sight something contradic- tory in it. If we take it as a defense of science (which it is) but as nothing more, then its result, instead of being to emancipate man, is apparently to imprison him. For what is it, to be caught in the vortex of natural necessity? Sim- ply to be one of the things that fall within the category of necessitated phenomena; that is, to have nothing about us better or greater than the phenomena which fall under that category. To be necessitated is to be borne down the stream of change along with these, as one of them-</page><page sequence="9">POST-KANTIAN IDEALISM. 337 selves. It is to act like the falling stone or the running water; to be linked up with all other events in the mechanical-causal system of the world. Now, the causal system, if the doctrine of Kant have any truth, must be all-embracing. It is one expression of that law-abiding character of the universe which makes the latter an object of knowledge. Hence the causal system stretches as far as the knowability of the universe does; and that means all the way. For where the universe ceases to be knowable, there (at least, if we follow the post-Kantian interpreta- tion of Kant) it ceases to be. And with this result the possibility of freedom seems to vanish. Man is a denizen of this universe. Everything which is in the universe at all, every act and event and object, must conform to the conditions of knowability; and to be causally construable is one of these. But the emancipation of the spirit of man is none the less a fact. There is a way out of the contradiction. The causal system, truly, has been made applicable to every act or process within the knowable universe. But by the same dialectic any activity which should happen not to fall within that universe has been raised above the causal category. Now, there is such an activ- ity. We are driven to assume it whenever we try to track the causal series to its source. That source is not, of course, in time. We cannot go back in time to some initial push which set it all agoing. Its source is to be sought rather where time itself has its source, namely, in that 'whole' which must be and which yet, without the causal order, could not be; a whole which we take to be spirit be- cause it appears in us as our spirit. This is the source of the order in the world. De-spiritualized the world would be mere chaos, a confused, spongy, mass of vacant, dull sense-appearance. But as it is, the world appears in knowledge as perpetually rising above its own con- fusion, thus revealing the rational order latent in it. It assumes articulation and character by stages. Of these stages the causal order is one, just as the space order and</page><page sequence="10">338 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. the time order are others; and all together make up the connected objective system of things and events. This self-transcendence of the world, then, is an activity which cannot fall within the universe of which it is itself the pro- ducer. It cannot itself be one of the events which, through it, are set into causal order. You cannot take it as a mere member within a series, if the whole of the series exists only as its activity. We are thus driven to assume an act or process which is above necessity. Moreover, this process or activity is not one of which we are mere de- tached spectators, For with which we have nothing to do. This rise of the whole into its true being through the emer- gence in it of time order, space order, causal order, and the rest, is a process in which we are concerned. For what is active here is the very spirit which is our spirit. The self-articulation of the universe into order takes place in us, or rather as us. It is a thing which we do. Nay, it is the thing which we do; it is that awakening of spirit in which alone we are truly ourselves. It is the rising out of a characterless continuum of experience into one which is organized; or it is the transcendence of one degree of organization by a higher. This activity is at once the human mind and the veritable process whereby the uni- verse sustains itself. It is not of course the latter in its complete detail. There is much more of the universe than becomes conscious of itself in any one of us. But it is the principle of the whole universe. Up to its own degree it is sustaining the whole; or rather, up to that degree it is the self-sustaining whole. The act of constitutive intelligence, then, through which spirit rises into determinateness, cannot be linked up within the causal system, because the causal system is its own creation. The labor of reason in building up the real world is the original, of which the characteristics of the real world,-the causal system amongst them,-are the de- rivative. There is a difference of agent and product be- tween the intelligent activity which is the source of the natural order and all action which falls within that order.</page><page sequence="11">POST-KANTIAN IDEALISM. 339 This difference is what the idealist expresses by saying that intelligent action is free, while natural changes are not. It is a freedom which is not simply permitted by the phenomenal order; it is a freedom which that order im- plies as the indispensable condition of its own being. But, it will be asked, is it really 'freedom' ? Is it what the moral consciousness is looking for, and demands should be? If our earlier account be correct, we are bound, I think, to say that it is. We found there what the freedom of an act meant. It means originality,-ownership of its own consequences, if we might say so. And intelligent action is this. The ultimate source of all actions as ideal- ism concedes to the materialist, is the whole; but that system-constituting function which is our intelligent ac- tivity is the whole. It is the whole functioning as our spirit. Up to the little extent of our rational culture and intelligence, we are the ultimate whole. Hence to that extent, we, being that which does our actions, are the real and original doers of themii; and therefore we are free. Of course, idealism has given no answer to the freedom problem, unless'what it has shown to be free be the right thing, namely, human activity. Now, we have been deal- ing here with the constitutive activity of reason in knowl- edge, and we might be asked what connection that has with the practical activities of a human being? It is impossible to deal fully with this question here, but it really amounts to a demand for what idealism has already effected; namely, an advance beyond the hard distinctions of the Kantian system. What is required is that we should show every rational act which we perform to imply at bottom the same synthesizing function as is present in that free activity through which the order of knowledge comes to be. We want to do, in fact, what Fichte did, when he tele- scoped Kant's 'I ought' into his 'I think,' translated both into the spiritual activity, 'I am,' and placed' that at the root of knowledge and practice alike. This, taken thor- oughly and seriously, confers originality upon the ra- tional agent in all his activity; and it confines originality</page><page sequence="12">340 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. to him. It makes him free, and makes him the only being who is free. His intelligent and rational self is made unique in that it is identified with that which really did his act, namely, the universe. In so far as I am a human be- ing I am the author of what issues from me, even though it also came from the world; for I am identified with the world. To the view that the sum of the conditions which have made me what I am, do all my deeds, the answer is: so they do; but it is not as so many 'conditions' that they act. The conditions "gather themselves up into a person before they do such things, and that person is I." Of course the old querulous question will still come up: "Could my antecedents, united in me as my personality, have conditioned any other act than this? Could I have helped this act, which it seems, was in my antecedent be- ing and had to come out?" This question will never cease to come up; for we shall never cease, in our trivial moods, to fall below the level of clear thinking. But no amount of repetition can ever put meaning into a mean- ingless phrase. The old alternatives remain. The ques- tion either means 'was I the doer'? or it is self-contradic- tory. In the latter case it needs no answer, because it asks nothing. In the former case, when we once grasp what idealism has to say about the meaning of 'I,' the answer to the question is in the affirmative. J. W. SCOTT. UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW.</page></plain_text>
