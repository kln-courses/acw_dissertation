MEMOIRES: FOR PAUL DE MAN. Trans. Cecile Lindsay, Jonathan Culler, and Eduardo Cadava. New York: Columbia UP, 1986. Harold Jenkins, ed. HAMLET. By William Shakespeare. London: Methuen, 1982. Richard Klein, ed. "NUCLEAR CRITICISM." diacritics 14.2 (1984). Ghosts always pass quickly, with the infinite speed of a furtive apparition, in an instant without duration, presence without present of a present which, coming back, only haunts. The ghost, le re-venant, the survivor, appears only by means offigure or fiction, but its appearance is not nothing, nor is it a mere semblance. -Derrida, Memoires In 1984 comes the announcement of a "new" discourse: nuclear criticism. This, according to Richard Klein, involves (1) "the application of literary critical procedures to the logic and rhetoric of nuclear war," and (2) "the interpretation of canonical texts through the perspective of nuclear criticism." The statement appears at the beginning of a special issue of diacritics that includes what is arguably one of Derrida's most overtly "political" essays, "No Apocalypse, Not Now (full speed ahead, seven missiles, seven missives)" (hereafter "NA"). This essay addresses what is regarded as a currently indeterminate shift, in philosophy, literary criticism, and elsewhere, concerning the place and play of chance, and in the relations between belief and science. Enter the question of the nuclear. Derrida writes: "One can no longer oppose belief and science, doxa and episteme, once one has reached the decisive place of the nuclear age, in other words, once one has arrived at the critical place of the nuclear age. In this critical place, there is no more room for a distinction between belief and science, thus no more space for a 'nuclear criticism' strictly speaking" ["NA" 24]. There is no "nuclear criticism" strictly speaking. Exit. Or, perhaps, Enter-but as a ghost.' 1. To which should perhaps be added: given the rapidity of changes in the past two or three years alone, even if we are to carry on with an (ineluctably phantom-like) "nuclear criticism"-identifying it by way of a particular set of temporal and rhetorical dilemmas or effects-it will no doubt be necessary to articulate it onto or into the equally general and crucial question of a certain "environmental" or "eco- criticism." diacritics 20.1 (1990): 339-55 diacritics / spring 1990</page><page sequence="4">"Nuclear criticism" would occupy a placeless place, in which putatively straightforward distinctions between belief and science no longer operate. And it would be partly for this reason that, as Derrida remarks a little later, "nuclear criticism" is "in principle and conceptually, irreducible to the model of the universitas" ["NA" 30]. What form, then, might a piece of "nuclear criticism" take? What if we were to pursue the hypothesis of "nuclear criticism" as a kind of ghost? What might this ghost have to tell us? In speaking, it would seem an exemplum of the rhetorical figure of prosopopoeia, the figure described by Paul de Man as that of "the voice-from-beyond-the-grave" [The Rhetoric of Roman- ticism (hereafter RR) 77]. What might this prosopopoeia be? Fragmentary-following the seven "missives" or "missiles" of Derrida's "No Apocalypse"-the present text is an attempt to respond to such questions. Since the special issue of diacritics, there has been a relative proliferation of texts concerned with "nuclear criticism." Richard Klein and William B. Warner's "Nuclear Coincidence and the Korean Airline Disaster" is an obvious example. And a reasonably good general overview can be found in Christopher Norris's "On Derrida's 'Apocalyptic Tone': Textual Politics and the Principle of Reason," which argues that it is in the "present situation of a radical instability affecting all the discourses of knowledge and power that deconstruction finds itself tactically aligned with the purposes of 'nuclear criticism"' [26]. But only the first part of the original diacritics proposal appears, so far, to have been much developed: "the application of literary critical procedures to the logic and rhetoric of nuclear war." The following pages propose to explore the other side: "the interpre- tation of canonical texts through the perspective of nuclear criticism." I am taking the essay "No Apocalypse" as a kind of button, to set or start off an account of Shakespeare's Hamlet and Derrida's Memoires. Memoires Derrida's Memoires (hereafter M), consisting of three lectures ("Mnemosyne," "The Art of Memoires," and "Acts: The Meaning of a Given Word") given "for Paul de Man," in, to, and for his memory, was written in January and February 1984, a few weeks after de Man's death. Viewing de Man's work, in particular, in terms of its consistent (if sometimes only implicit or apparently peripheral) engagements with notions of "memory," Mermoires moves over a formidable range of topics: deconstruction and memory, death and mourning, promises and affirmation, the proper name and signature, prosopopoeia and autobiography. The three lectures are preceded by a few words published as a kind of spoken preface, entitled "A peine," a few words with which these lectures, on their initial delivery at Yale University in March 1984, begin. "A peine": "'Hardly' might be the best approximation" [M xiii] to this French phrase. The title also resonates with various senses of peine as a noun: sorrow, sadness; effort, trouble; difficulty. Derrida intimates the sorrow and the difficulty; he speaks of being hardly able "to say something, to begin, recommence and continue" [M xiv]. Wanting to respect this muted preface and wishing to meditate on other forms and questions of mutedness, encountering perhaps untranslatable, unrepresentable difficulty and sadness, in the present essay I follow this "a peine." Here, too, it may be hardly possible to speak or say anything of Memoires, of the work of Derrida or de Man, or of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Hamlet There it is-in the words of one of America's most eloquent "nuclear" poets, Wallace Stevens-"the planet on the table" [Collected Poems 532-33]. The Arden edition of 40</page><page sequence="5">Hamlet edited by Harold Jenkins appeared in 1982, eighty-three years after the Arden Hamlet edited by Edward Dowden. Jenkins's edition, running to 574 pages, surrounding the text of Hamlet with an unprecedented apparatus of introduction, footnotes, "Longer Notes," and an appendix, stands as a monument in the history of the Arden edition and in the history of Shakespeare scholarship as a whole. It might almost seem as if the text of Shakespeare's Hamlet itself has become encrypted, swallowed up, as a monument within a monument. Or else it may be the other way around. Hamlet, perhaps the greatest or best-known literary monument in the English language, swallows up texts, incorporates anything in its path, and its path goes everywhere, adds to itself ceaselessly, inescapably, relentlessly stockpiling itself.... In "Living On: Borderlines," Derrida focuses on the idea that "Each text is a machine with multiple reading heads for other texts" [ 107]. I hope to show thatMemoires provides a reading of Hamlet but also, and perhaps more distinctively, that Hamlet provides a reading of Me'moires. Me'moires does not refer directly to Hamlet-though significantly, as we will see, Shakespeare's name is not absent from its pages. At the same time, the two texts certainly have in common a more or less overwhelming preoccupation with mourning. It was, we might recall, Jacques Lacan who made this observation of Shakespeare's play: "I know of no commentator who has ever taken the trouble to make this remark, however hard it is to overlook once it has been formulated: from one end of Hamlet to the other, all anyone talks about is mourning" [39]. Mourning takes on a force and ubiquity or universality similar to that hauntingly evoked by Derrida's important proposition, towards the end of "No Apocalypse": " . . there is no common measure adequate to persuade me that a personal mourning is less serious than a nuclear war" ["NA" 28]. How might we elaborate the question of mourning and nuclear war or nuclear catastrophe? Mourning is linked, in both Hamlet and Memoires, to notions of memory, name, and monumentalization. It is in these terms that I seek to read Shakespeare's play. My reading of Hamlet, then, is neither psychoanalytic nor (in any straightforward sense) decon- structive. I am not particularly or primarily interested in issues of "character," "plot," or "theme." Rather, the interest lies in what might be considered the unthematizable-in how Shakespeare's text, together with Memoires, presents and unfolds, complicates and folds over mourning, memory, name and monumentalization.2 2. See also Ned Lukacher, Primal Scenes: Literature, Philosophy, Psychoanalysis [Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1986], in particular 168-72, on Hamlet and "Hamletism," and his chapter entitled "Shakespeare in the Ear of Hegel" [178-235]. Lukacher's study is deeply engaged with notions of memory, remembrance, and recollection. The term "primal scene," in his account, becomes "a tropefor reading and understanding," "an intertextual event that displaces the notion of eventfrom the ground of ontology" or, more specifically, "the interpretive impasse that arises when a reader has good reason to believe that the meaning of one text is historically dependent on the meaning of another text or on a previously unnoticed set of criteria, even though there is no conclusive evidential or archival means of establishing the case beyond a reasonable doubt" [24]. This leads to readings that are certainly in keeping with a notion of "taking chances"-to cite the title of the collection of essays, ed. Joseph H. Smith and William Kerrigan [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1984], that contains Derrida's important contribution, "My Chances / Mes Chances: A Rendez- vous with Some Epicurean Stereophonies." (Another study of related interest here is William Beatty Warner's Chance and the Text of Experience: Freud, Nietzsche, and Shakespeare's "Hamlet" [Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1986], though, as Warner himself acknowledges [21], its writing unfortunately predates the appearance of Taking Chances itself.) Lukacher's chapter on Hamlet fastens on the phrase "Well said, old mole" [15.1 70] and on Hegel's disastrous but rhetorically necessary misreading of it as "Well done, old mole." Lukacher plays Molecatcher, following the cryptic movements of this "figure of a figure" [212] through the text. Although the analysis diacritics / spring 1990 41</page><page sequence="6">What Is Literature? "No Apocalypse" defines literature as "the body of texts whose existence, possibil- ity, and significance are the most radically threatened, for the first and last time, by the nuclear catastrophe" ["NA" 27]. Literature belongs to what Derrida calls the nuclear epoch. "Epoch" here involves also the notion of "epoch e": "literature" thus belongs to that which is allied to "the historical and ahistorical horizon of an absolute self- destructibility without apocalypse, without revelation of its own truth, without absolute knowledge" ["NA" 27]. Derrida asserts: literature comes to life and can only experience its ownprecariousness, its death menace and its essential finitude. The movement of its inscription is the very possibility of its effacement. Thus one cannot be satisfied with saying that, in order to become serious and interesting today, a literature and a literary criticism must refer to the nuclear issue, must even be obsessed by it. This has to be said, and it is true. But I believe also that, at least indirectly, they have always done this. Literature has always belonged to the nuclear epoch, even if it does not talk "seriously" about it. And in truth I believe that the nuclear epoch is dealt with more "seriously" in texts by Mallarme, or Kafka, or Joyce, for example, than in present-day novels that would offer direct and realistic descriptions of a "real" nuclear catastrophe. ["NA" 27-28] This is one hypothesis that the following pages will try to demonstrate: Shakespeare's Hamlet belongs to the nuclear epoch; it is a nuclear drama, a nuclear text. Hamlet concerns nuclear catastrophe-and in an exemplary way, perhaps, insofar as it coincides historically with the emergence or beginning of what Derrida calls "the project of literature," a project that "cannot be shown to antedate the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries" ["NA" 27]. proceeds from a traditionally (and problematically) characterological perspective-stressing Hamlet's "will" [202], his "being" or "inner state" [205], "Hamlet's psyche" [312], and so on- its aim is to show the "old mole" as a figure of emphatically disruptive power. Concluding with the striking revelation of an agnostic "primal scene" involving the texts of Shakespeare, Thomas Nashe, and Robert Greene, Lukacher tracks the "mole" to a number of purportedly compatible sites: something deep in Hamlet's "character" [205], "the darkside of human [sic: masculine and feminine?] desire" [209], something that is "still burrowing" [209], the "unrestrained expression offeminine [sic] desire" [2141, a "new abstract subjectivity" [215] or "new and abyssalform of subjectivity" [225], and-last but not least-" Shakespeare" "himself' [235]. For what is in many ways a more detailed and more rigorous account of Hamlet and "femininity," from a psychoana- lytical perspective, see Jacqueline Rose's "Hamlet-the 'Mona Lisa' of Literature," in her Sexuality in the Field of Vision [London: Verso, 1986] 123-40. It should also be said that Lukacher's "old mole" has evident correspondences with Nicolas Abraham's notions of "crypt" and "phantom." His failure to acknowledge explicitly the importance of these notions and his largely dismissive characterizations of Abraham's work on Hamlet (as "highly fanciful," "slightly misguided," even "utterly preposterous" [225-26] seem inappropriate, if not ungracious. See diacritics 18.4 (1988) for a sequence of illuminating texts: "The Phantom of Hamlet or The Sixth Act: Preceded by The Intermission of 'Truth,'" by Nicolas Abraham [2-19]; "Family Romance or Family History? Psychoanalysis and Dramatic Invention inNicolas Abraham's 'The Phantom of Hamlet,"' by Nicholas Rand [20-30]; and "Toolsfor a New Psychoanalytic Literary Criticism: The Work of Abraham and Torok," by Esther Rashkin [31-52]. Finally,for another recent critical study, highlighting Shakespeare's play as "obsessively concerned with remembering and forget- ting" [147], see Marjorie Garber's Shakespeare's Ghost Writers: Literature As Uncanny Causality (New York: Methuen, 1987), esp. 124-76. 42</page><page sequence="7">"A Death Machine" We cannot have a nuclear war; it cannot be spoken of. A nuclear war cannot be fought, either lost or won. Obviously Derrida is not saying that nuclear war or nuclear catastrophe cannot occur. As he stresses in "Like the Sound of the Sea Deep within a Shell," "the future" is necessarily "that which cannot be anticipated" [595]: speaking what he calls "the language of consciousness," Derrida clearly notes "the order of the unforeseeable, which is always the condition of any event" [593]. On the one hand, this does not mean that the future cannot be computed, imagined, or thought about. Indeed, as I hope to suggest, there is a sense in which "the future" is necessarily inscribed within us, and this "future" must cohabit with the thought of nuclear catastrophe. On the other hand, it should be emphasized that "No Apocalypse" is concerned with the respects in which the nuclear catastrophe cannot take place, insofar as it would be the absolute and remainderless destruction of the archive and of literature. Derrida's essay provides a special focus on the notion that if nuclear holocaust has any kind of existence at all, it is in language, as rhetoric and fiction.3 There is only the rhetoric of nuclear deterrence and the exchanges of messages, codes, dispatches. Nuclear missiles are missives: "Just as all language, all writing, every poetico-performative or theoretico-informative text dis- patches, sends itself, allows itself to be sent, so today's missiles, whatever their underpinnings may be, allow themselves to be described more readily than ever as dispatches in writing (code, inscription, trace, and soon)..." ["NA" 29]. But not "simply" that: it is also a question of "that which, in writing, always includes the power of a death machine" ["NA" 29]. In Hamlet, and as if as a warning of things to come, one might think of the extent to which characters, plot, and structure are effects of a death machine, constituted by dispatches, missives, codes: spy satellites like Reynaldo, listening stations behind the arras, the letter that would have killed Hamlet but is the death of Rosencrantz and Guildenstem instead; and then the extent to which the explicitly "political," national, and international aspects of the drama-of Denmark, Norway, Poland, England-are pro- duced or realized through dispatches. Right down to the rhetoric of the death threat, presented to Claudius by Hamlet's epistolary announcement of his "sudden and more strange return" [4.7.45]. Here, as elsewhere in Hamlet, there is a certain movement of madness, of what mutually assured destruction would be, and the concept of Star Wars, or "stealth" technology, in the context of this "sterile promontory" [2.2.299], the earth, is never entirely foreign.4 But the relation of writing to the notion of a death machine is also more subtle and more complex than this. Henry Staten's Wittgenstein and Derrida (hereafter WD) gives special emphasis to the place of "death" in Derrida's texts. He shows how Derrida is able "to define less apparently radical forms of absence-such as absentmindedness or the 3. Cf. Andrzej Warminski's "Missed Crossing: Wordsworth's Apocalypses" [MLN 99.5 1984: 983-1006], which explores distinctions between "natural Apocalypse" and "the Apoca- lypse of Books" in Wordsworth's "Dream of the Arab" [Prelude, Book 5]. Warminski draws attention to the uncanny logic whereby "the natural Apocalypse has already come ("Old Ocean, in his bed left singed and bare"), and the real problem is the cleaved, double Apocalypse of Books, for it contains the difference between itself and the natural Apocalypse within itself' [1003]. In a related context, and in particular for its admirably clear account of the peculiar temporality of the "nuclear condition", see also Richard Klein's "The Future of Nuclear Criticism," Yale French Studies 77 (1990): 76-100. 4. In an essay in other ways very different from the present text, "Hamlet's Dull Revenge" [Stanford Literature Review 1.2 (1984): 159-200], Rene Girard alsofocuses on "theforces which led Hamlet to the last act of his play andwhich might lead, today, to its planetary equivalent" [199]. diacritics / spring 1990 43</page><page sequence="8">wandering of attention-as forms of death" [WD 121]. In this, a concept of writing is decisive. Writing always involves "the possibility of a radical break in presence" [WD 120], or what Derrida refers to as "the possibility of the 'death' of the addressee, inscribed in the structure of the mark" [Margins 316; qtd. in Staten 120]. Like Irene Harvey's more recent book, Derrida and the Economy of Differance, Staten's is acknowledging, forcefully and pervasively, that Derrida's texts open up something like a reconceptuali- zation of "death," if one could say such a thing. As he summarizes the argument and effects of the critique of Husserlian phenomenology in Speech and Phenomena (1967): "the thought of my death is the necessary condition for the thought of presence" [WD 150]. This has immediate and far-reaching consequences for the concept of tragedy. As Staten observes, "tragedy is a necessary possibility constitutive, as necessary possibility, of the essence of human life" [WD 128]. Mourning, writing, monumentalization: these three notions mark the "nuclear power" of the tragedy of Hamlet. How? An Interlude: Two Remarks First remark. "No Apocalypse," after the "full speed ahead" of its subtitle, begins by warning against going too fast. "The hypothesis of... total destruction watches over deconstruction, it guides its footsteps" ["NA" 27]. Deconstruction is informed by a certain "apocalyptic desire" ["Of an Apocalyptic Tone" (hereafter "AT") 22]. But an apocalyptic tone, language, urgency should be, on the other hand, accompanied and tempered by an extreme vigilance, perhaps difficult to think except vicariously as an instantiation of slow-motion.... Derrida indicates the paradoxical doubling of such an "in the same time"5 in various texts. In some sense it appears to match the notion of deconstruction as a kind of double writing or double gesture. As Derrida emphasizes in Positions [41-42], deconstruction involves (and, as it were, convolves) both the inversion or "overturning" and the displacement and "disorganizing" of philosophical hierarchical oppositions. Deconstruction entails "interminable analysis." As with any characteriza- tion of the pace of the "politics of deconstruction," it must go slowly: there is always the danger that "one might proceed too quickly to a neutralization that in practice would leave the previous field untouched, leaving one no hold on the previous opposition" [41]. At the same time, however, this double movement of deconstruction is not "chronological" [41]; rather, it attempts to mark a kind of unthinkable "interval" and irruption. As "Of an Apocalyptic Tone" indicates, the apocalypticism of deconstruction involves simultane- ously "the enigmatic desire... for elucidation, for critique and truth" and the "desire for clarity and revelation, in order... to deconstruct apocalyptic discourse itself and with it everything that speculates on vision, the imminence of the end, theophany, parousia, the last judgment" ["AT" 22]. What is this "same time," this "interval," this "simultane- ously"? It seems that it is a question of what can never be present; a question of the condition of the possibility and impossibility of the apocalyptic. It is thus that Derrida's essay on apocalyptic tone is able to suggest that "the apocalyptic" is "a transcendental 5. The phrase "in the same time" occurs in Derrida's "Aphorism Countertime" [trans. Nicholas Royle, forthcoming in a collection of Derrida's writings on literary texts, ed. Derek Attridge (New York: Routledge)]. One pertinent example might be that text's notion of "accidents." "Accidents" are classed as such only by being inscribed within a temporality which thus allowsfor them. "Accidents" are in this manner "determined" or "non-accidental." Derrida is concerned with the logic by which an accident "can only be what it is, accidental, insofar as it has already happened, in essence, before it happens." For a more extended and extremely clarifying account of "time" inDerrida'swork, see Timothy Clark, "Time after Time: Temporality, Temporalization," in Oxford Literary Review 9 (1987): 119-35. 44</page><page sequence="9">condition of all discourse, of all experience even, of every mark or every trace" ["AT" 27]. But we are perhaps going too quickly-what is the time of the interval glimpsed here? Is it "glimpsed"? This will form a further dimension of my argument: that many of the texts identified with what is called "poststructuralism," "deconstruction," and even "nuclear criticism" explore a certain movement of acceleration; and that in some sense such a movement seems also to be characteristic of what goes by the name of "literature." This would also no doubt involve thinking according to, and about, "the standpoint of narrative temporality that has become possible by virtue of what. .. Derrida has called the 'fabulous textuality' of the nuclear phenomenon" [Klein and Warner 2]. Second remark. Continuing on from this, and linked to the "hardly" that Derrida hardly speaks of, I would like to bring into play Samuel Weber's afterword to Lyotard and Thebaud's Just Gaming (1985), in which he speculates on the notion of a literature de justesse [114]-of texts that, through derangements of temporality, by way of a move- ment or structure that corresponds with "the fits and starts of the unconscious" [111], scrape through, texts that just make it and (it is suggested) make it just. Whether such texts can properly be designated "literature" or "philosophy" or "psychoanalysis," whether indeed they can be said to be nameable at all, is what we might call a moot or mute point. Weber's play with the term "justesse" puts stress not only on the sense of "exactness," "accuracy," or "soundness" but more specifically on "de justesse"-the sense of barely making it, scarcely doing something, just managing it: for instance, only just succeeding in writing a text [114]. Or reading it. I would like to follow Weber but substitute for the term "justesse," or "just," the term "sound." I propose to graft "sound," as silently and discreetly as possible, onto Derrida's [a] peine and Weber's [de] justesse. In particular, I hope to conclude by exploring the apparently arbitrary and unmotivated relation between "sound" (as "a transmitted disturbance perceived or perceptible by the ear" [Chambers Dictionary]) and "sound" (as the etymologically unrelated adjective, "safe," "unimpaired," "well founded," "of the right way of thinking"). To introduce a currently popular American idiomatic verb in order to evoke a disturbingly (if stereotypically) anthropomorphic prosopopoeia: it will be a matter of the uncanniness of "sound," of exploring the ways in which "sound" (1) and "sound" (2) speak to one another. A question, as we may discover, of the impossibility of the audibility of prosopopoeia. This will be the hypothesis then: there are texts (of "literature," "poststructuralism," "decon- struction," "nuclear criticism") that hardly make it, just or barely make it-texts that are sound, that make it sound, without a sound. In the Name of Promises Derrida's lectures in memory of Paul de Man focus and disperse the questions of these things-speed, apocalypse, the time of deconstruction, the just or sound, etc.-as well as mourning, memory, and identity. Identity, especially, in terms of the name. As Derrida suggests, "We cannot separate the name of 'memory' and 'memory' of the name; we cannot separate the name and memory" [M 49]. Enter the play, Hamlet, reading. "I am glad to see you well. / Horatio, or I do forget myself' [1.2.160-61]. Memoires reads Hamlet; Hamlet reads Memoires. These titles and these texts read one another. Memoires of Hamlet: we might try to listen out for, or listen in on, an intertextuality whereby each speaks through the other of what de Man refers to as "the monumental dignity of aesthetic values" [RR 68]. We read the name of "Hamlet" and in the name of Hamlet. To read the name of "Hamlet" we must, like Stephen Dedalus with his father in Cork, be able to read "death" in the name of "the present holder" [Joyce 89] of a name. A dead "Hamlet" must be always already legible in the living. To read in the name of Hamlet is to read in the name of the archive, in the name of its preservation and diacritics / spring 1990 45</page><page sequence="10">at the same time of the necessary possibility of its disappearance. Our culture ticks by in its name and in the chances of its effacement or obliteration. "Horatio, I am dead, / Thou livest" [5.2.343-44]. And then: 0 God, Horatio, what a wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall I leave behind me. If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart, Absent thee from felicity awhile, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain To tell my story [5.2.349-54] A little further on in Memoires, Derrida suggests that "The name, or what can be considered as such, as having the function or power of the name-this is the sole object and sole possibility of memory, and in truth the only 'thing' that it can at the same time both name and think" [M 54]. What follows from this is that the name carries death: "any name, any nominal function, is 'in memory of'-from the first 'present' of its appearance, and finally, is 'in virtually-bereaved memory of' even during the life of its bearer" [M 54]. Just as the possibility of death is a necessary condition of presence, so death necessarily inhabits the name [see M 49]. Not only "death" but "mouming." There is a certain "being- in-me" or "being-in-us" of another person, of a loved one, Derrida argues, and "We know, we knew, we remember-before the death of the loved one-that being-in-me or being- in-us is constituted out of the possibility of mourning" [M 34]. So, in particular by way of the deathly power of the name, "already you are in memory of your own death; and your friends as well, and all the others, both of your own death and already of their own through yours" [M 87]. One should not, Derrida suggests, "speak badly or unjustly of death" for then "We would run the risk of wounding, in our memory, those whom it bears" [M 87]. It is notonly a question of the"wounded name" of Hamlet-which is the name of both father and son and effectively of Shakespeare's son (Hamnet) as well-but also, for example, of Claudius and Laertes. The "whisper" of what is in some sense nameless (Theobald's phrase, "So envious slander," fills in what is missing from Shakespeare's text) is, for Claudius, a thoroughly intercontinental weapon: [So envious slander], Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter, As level as the cannon to his blank, Transports his poison'd shot, may miss our name And hit the woundless air [4.1.40-44] And Laertes must chance, and lose, his life in order, as he says, "To keep my name ungor'd" [5.2.246]. Shakespeare's play is dominated throughout by the question of the memorization of the name, of the chances of its not being remembered, of the avoidance of its being "wounded" or "gored." From beginning to end. And before the beginning. The name must overflow. Not just insofar as the drama begins with mourning and commemoration: mourning in some sense precedes the play. But also insofar as the drama is preceded, prefaced and promised, gathered together in advance, by its title and its name-Hamlet. As Derrida remarks in Memoires, "A title is always a promise" [M 115]. Even if "a pure promise cannot properly take place, in a proper place ... promising is inevitable as soon as we open our mouths-or rather as soon as there is a text" [M 98]. He describes how de Man shows "the performative structure of the text in general as promise, including that of the demonstrative text, that which Paul de Man signs" [M 93]. And including the text Jacques Derrida signs (we will return to this)... "A promise is always excessive. 46</page><page sequence="11">Without this essential excess, it would return to a description or knowledge of the future. Its act would have a constative structure and not a performative one" [M 93-94]. So there is an unsettling, "a kind of irremediable disturbance or perversion" of "the performative as promise." And Derrida goes on to suggest that this excess and this unsettling account for "the unbelievable, and comical, aspect of every promise, and this passionate attempt to come to terms with the law, the contract, the oath, the declared affirmation of fidelity" [M 94]. Shakespeare's play stages Derrida's analysis once more, for in terms of promise, performative and performance, this is also the structure of Hamlet, in and from its title onwards. "Adieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me" [1.5.91]. And hence the movement of incipient comicality through "We have sworn, my lord, already" and Hamlet's "Well said, old mole" [1.5.155, 170]. Most of all, it seems, it is a question of the promise in terms of mourning, in terms of the memory and name. The first promise, one could say-and this promise is linked to what Derrida regards as a kind of "affirmation." One must say "yes." Such affirmation is seen as being "at the heart of deconstruction," and Paul de Man is "a thinker of affirmation" [M 20-21]. There is an affirmation of memory, of the memory of the loved one. There is, says Derrida, a "'yes,' which is a non-active act, which states or describes nothing, which in itself neither manifests nor defines any content, this yes only commits, before and beyond everything else. And to do so, it must repeat itself to itself: yes, yes. It must preserve memory; it must commit itself to keeping its own memory; it must promise itself to itself; it must bind itself to memory for memory, if anything is ever to come from the future" [M 20]. "Heaven and earth, / Must I remember?" [1.2.142-43]. The "I" must remember, as we will see, even if this involves the effacement of itself. Hamlet seems to know very clearly the necessity of double, and even triple, affirmation. "Remember thee? / Ay... /... Remember thee? / Yea, from the table of my memory / I'll wipe away all trivial fond records... / ... Yes, by heaven!" [1.5.95-104]. Obviously all of this is not to suggest some surreal parallel between Hamlet and his father, on the one hand, and Derrida and de Man on the other. Again, we are not concerned with any kind of characterologico-psychoanalytical reading of Shakespeare's play, let alone of Derrida's lectures. Rather it is here a matter of how these texts-Hamlet and Memoires-present the structure of promises and of remembrance. Thus, glossing J. L. Austin's "The Meaning of a Word," Derrida's text in turn seems to repeat: "The act of this lecture... remember... promise me and promise yourself to remember it" [M 113]. Remembering Deconstruction It is in the context of a linking of memory, promise, and affirmation that we might follow Derrida's very cautious characterization of deconstruction as "memory work": "Since the disruptive force of deconstruction is always already contained within the architecture of the work, all one would finally have to do to be able to deconstruct, given this always already, is to do memory work" [M 73]. The identification of "decon- struction" with "memory work" would have to be qualified, certainly, by the decon- structive effects of a reinscribed "concept" of memory. Derrida attributes such a deconstruction to the texts of Paul de Man; Memoires in some sense performs such a promise, such a "non-active act," as well. Together these texts question what Hegel, in the Encyclopedia, formulates as an opposition between Geddchtnis and Erinnerung- where "Geddchtnis is both the memory that thinks (and moreover preserves in itself, literally, through the echo in its very name, the memory of Denken) and voluntary memory, specifically the mechanical faculty of memorization, while Erinnerung is interiorizing memory, 'recollection as the inner gathering and preserving of experience"' diacritics / spring 1990 47</page><page sequence="12">[M 51]. This questioning, which is also an unsettling, takes place in a number of ways. Two examples: 1. De Man postulates that "Memory effaces remembrance (or recollection) just as the I effaces itself' [qtd. in M 56]. Derrida emphasizes that this "just as" is not juxtaposing "two analogous possibilities"; rather, it is "the same possibility" and "same necessity . . . which makes the inscription of memory an effacement of interiorizing recollection, of the 'living remembrance' at work in the presence of the relation to self' [M 56]. One could also add that this is precisely what is dramatized when Hamlet, in order to remember the Ghost's "word," goes rushing for his "tables" in order to "set it down" [1.5.107]. 2. Linked to this, there is a questioning of Heidegger's proposals that "science does not think," that "the essence of technology is nothing technological," and that, in Derrida's paraphrase, "thinking speech, the thinking of rhetoricity itself is not rhetorical" [M 139]. The effect of this questioning is perhaps too summarily, but still devastatingly, figured in Derrida's assertion that there is no gap or abyss between thinking thought or thinking memory (Gedicht- nis) and science, technology, writing (mnemonics); or rather, this maintenance, in a Heideggerian manner, of a heterogeneity between the essence of technology and technology (which is, by the way, one of the most traditional of gestures), between thinking memory and science, thinking memory and technicist writing, is precisely a protection against an other abyssal risk, that of parasitic contamination, of an an-oppositional differance.... [M 140] The "concepts" of "deconstruction" and "diff6rance" thus engage a certain undoing, and a certain overflowing, of traditional notions and classifications of thought and memory, of writing and recollection, of all kinds of memory banks. "Memory," observes Derrida, "projects itself toward the future, and it constitutes the presence of the present" [M 57]. In other words, this "present" is never fully present; likewise the past. Hence Derrida's hypothesis of a "memory of the present" which "divide(s) the instant" [M 60]; and his suggestion that "for Paul de Man, great thinker and theorist of memory, there is only memory but, strictly speaking, the past does not exist. It will never have existed in the present, never been present.. ." [M 58-59]. Hence also, for example, the quotation marks surrounding the word "present" when Derrida asserts that "any name, any nominal function, is 'in memory of'-from the first 'present' of its appearance..." [M 54]. Again, it would be possible to demonstrate that de Man's and Derrida's questioning and displacement of memory and the present, of memory and thought, correspond in fundamental ways with Hamlet. Laertes's response to Ophelia's distracted state as "A document in madness: thoughts and remembrance fitted" [4.5.176-77] would be perhaps the most explicit manifestation of this dimension of Shakespeare's text. This is by no means to suggest an assimilation of de Man's or Derrida's work to some familiar and comfortable notion of "literature." Rather, Hamlet offers itself as a doubly exemplary text for the rigorous delineation of any identification between "deconstruction" and "memory work." We might say that it reviews, in the most sympathetic if eerie manner, the texts of de Man and Derrida. At the same time it corresponds with their texts in the ways in which it situates (or rather, has come to exemplify and situate, in our culture) the place and importance of the author's name, the signatory, the title, and in the ways in which it can be seen to explore what Derrida describes as the "radical precariousness" of literature and "the radical form of its historicity" ["NA" 27]. Tableau. 48</page><page sequence="13">Post Haste Registered, even in Derrida's earliest major work, OfGrammatology and Speech and Phenomena for instance, the primary force of an upsetting of temporality, of time and times. The reinscription of "memory" participates in this. And of"memoires," too. What is the time of a reading? What is the time of a performance of a reading? Derrida, in a footnote in Memoires, quotes de Man, in the epigraph to Allegories of Reading (1979), quoting Pascal-"When one reads too swiftly or too slowly one understands nothing" [M 88]-and Derrida asks, "But at what speed ought one to have read it?" [M 88]. It should, to begin with-but where?-have been in French; a question of being, among others, in translation. Derrida's footnote is signaled at the end of a paragraph in which he focuses on one of the most "persistent" motifs in de Man's work-namely "that of acceleration, of an absolute precipitousness. These words," Derrida continues, do not designate a particular rhythm, a measurable or comparable speed, but a movement which attempts through an infinite acceleration to win time, to win over time, to deny it, one might say, but in a non-dialectical fashion, since it is the form of the instant that is charged with the absolute discontinuity of this rhythm without rhythm. This acceleration is incommensurable, and thus infinite and null at the same time; it touches the sublime. [M 62] And then the footnote. Which also includes a brief reference to "the right measure" or "rhythm" of reading in terms of what "attempts to bring us to grasp a meaning that does not come through understanding" [M 88]. Hamlet goes on reading, and being read, here: doesn't Shakespeare's text also play out this question of the right measure or rhythm? "Then, venom, to thy work" [5.2.327]. And against a very long-established critical stress on delay, deferral, detour, inaction, irresolution in Hamlet, one could note, in passing, Shakespeare's exploration of what might appear precisely the opposite-that is, extraor- dinary acceleration, absolute precipitousness, a vertiginous rapidity, not only in the movement of its supposed closure and climax but also, if one can say this, at the heart of its form, or at the point of a dissolution between what de Man refers to as the opposition between "action and form" [qtd. in M 63]. "With wings as swift / As meditation or the thoughts of love" [1.5.29-30]-as swift, or even swifter. Promising Prosopopoeia Why write? What is the point of writing? Hamlet seems highly aware of the radical precariousness of it all. This is most explicit, perhaps, in the brief exchange in the Graveyard: Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins? Hor. Ay, my lord, and of calveskins too. Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. [5.1.112-15] Certain texts by Derrida, particularly Glas (1974) and Signeponge (1976, 1977), may be understood as arguing that the "autobiographical" desire in writing is the desire to monumentalize, and especially to sign or monumentalize one's name. This need not be thought of in empirical terms, as is suggested, for example, when Memoires proposes that diacritics / spring 1990 49</page><page sequence="14">the best signature, the "most giving," is "the one which knows how to efface itself' [M 26]. Memoires takes up the names of Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, and finally follows de Man's celebrated late essay, "Autobiography As De-Facement" [in RR], in focusing on the rhetorical figure of prosopopoeia as part of an elaboration of, among other things, the question of monumentalization. Literally "giving a face or person to," "proso- popoeia" is defined in OED primarily as "A rhetorical figure by which an imaginary or absent person is represented as speaking or acting; the introduction of a pretended speaker." OED cites R. Barnard (1609): prosopopoeia is "when wee bring in dead men speaking, or our selues doe take their person vpon vs, or giue voice vnto senselesse things." We have already broached this in introducing the hypothesis of "nuclear criticism" as a ghost, as a possible prosopopoeia or discourse of the "voice-from-beyond- the-grave": we shall return to this question of "voice" shortly. Milton's poem on Shakespeare (1630) asks, "What need'st thou such weak witness of thy name?" The "naked name" of Shakespeare is enough-Shakespeare requires no other epitaph. De Man remarks: "Prosopopoeia is the trope of autobiography, by which one's name, as in Milton's poem, is made as intelligible and memorable as a face" [qtd. in M 27]. It is in this context that we might introduce, in order to reread, Hamlet's encounter with the skull, with Yorick's skull, with Yorick or with the name of Yorick. This encounter is in a sense neither a soliloquy, nor a monologue, nor a dialogue. Encountering apparent silence, it may be conceived as neither apostrophe nor prosopopoeia but rather as a radical unsettling of the relation between the two: "Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now, your gambols, your songs, your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now to mock your own grinning? Quite chop-fallen? Now get you to my lady's chamber and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come" [5.1.182-88]. What is it that is coming? To set the table on a roar and, at the same time, to set it down in one's tables? "Favour" is glossed by Jenkins as "appearance (esp. of the face)" [386]. Prosopopoeia will always be, in the words of the example of Yorick, not only giving a mask or face but also "Quite chop-fallen." Autobiography is always also a thanatography. Any monumentalization will always be other. "Autobiography As De-Facement" examines Wordsworth's Essays on Epitaphs- a series of essays which "comes to be itself an epitaph, 'and more specifically, the author's own monumental inscription or autobiography"' [M 25, citing de Man]. De Man's essay consists of a few "magnificent" pages, Derrida says, and these pages "become in their turn, by doing what they tell of and by telling what they do, Paul de Man's epitaph, the prosopopoeia that he addresses to us . .." [M 26]. And in making such statements, Memoires becomes also Jacques Derrida's epitaph and this would be true regardless of whether Jacques Derrida is alive or dead [cf. M 29]. All of this could be seen as summarized in de Man's reference, at the end of his essay "Shelley Disfigured," to "the endless prosopopoeia by which the dead are made to have a face and a voice which tells the allegory of their demise and allows us to apostrophize them in our turn" [RR 122]. But it is also a matter of recognizing that this prosopopoeia-machine cannot be subordinated to what de Man calls "our strategy as subjects, since we are its product rather than its agent" [122]. When we apostrophize we have necessarily already been submitted to the power of the death machine: we are prosopopoeia. Both literature and philosophy, in this analysis, would be a kind of death work, worked by the dead in us (past and future), by the other, by "our" deaths. The chain of proper names, identifications, apostrophes or prosopopoe- ias is linked up in a manner that would not necessarily distinguish between "fictional" and "nonfictional" names: those of Yorick, Hamlet, Horatio, Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, de Man, Derrida. Here, the concatenation might almost seem a family, gathered together in the name of Shakespeare's Hamlet: what is being transmitted down that line, across 50</page><page sequence="15">that space?6 What promise, what prosopopoeia? Is it audible? And what might it mean to speak of Hamlet in terms of (a transmission of) sound? Let us now, after a seeming interval of silence, return to the notion of "sound." The Sound of "Hamlet" Thought thinks at the limit; it thinks the limit-the limit or boundary, as Derrida points out, of "interiority" [M 71], for example: "interiority," we might add, insofar as it would govern classifications and conceptions of mourning in terms of "introjection" and "incorporation"; "interiority," also, in relation to the sound of one's voice. For prosopopoeia is not only the rhetorical figure par excellence, the figure of the figure, person, or face: it is also a matter of the voice. Here Paul de Man's observation about lyric poetry might be extended to the notion of a haunting of texts in general. He writes: "The principle of intelligibility, in lyric poetry, depends on the phenomenalization of the speaking voice." Intelligibility depends upon "the actualization of a speaking voice" ["Lyrical Voice" 55].7 This can be set alongside Derrida's proposition, elaborated out of de Man's work, that prosopopoeia is a "fictive voice" which "already haunts any said real or present voice" [M 26]. "If thou hast any sound or use of voice ..." [1.1.131]. What is speech when "speech is nothing" [4.5.7]? "How now, what noise is that?" [4.5.153]. Shakespeare's play is relentlessly concerned with sound, with the ear, and the voice. It is concerned with "the general ear" [2.2.557], "ears of flesh and blood" [1.5.22], and also the singular ear- whether it is Bamardo's [1.1.1], King Hamlet's, Pyrrhus's [2.2.473], the "mildew'd ear" [3.4.64], the infected ear [4.5.90], Horatio's ear [4.6.22], and so on. Perhaps it is a matter of a crypt, an encrypting, even a name. But first and foremost, one must listen "with an attent ear" [ 1.2.193] to "nothing"-to the kind of silence to which the First Player refers, when he says: "we often see against some storm / A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still, I The bold winds speechless, and the orb below I As hush as death.. ." [2.2.479-82]. Or the kind of silence of the dumb-show; or of a skull that "had a tongue in it, and could sing once" [5.1.74]. Or that which envelops and punctuates the exchanges between Hamlet and his mother: Queen. To whom do you speak this? Ham. Do you see nothing there? Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see. Ham. Nor did you nothing hear? Queen. No, nothing but ourselves. [3.4.131-35] 6. Cf. Rene Major's thought-provoking analysis of Hamlet in terms of "trans-scenariority" [189] and the transference or grafting of proper names in his "Names: Proper and Improper," trans.

Cynthia Chase makes this point in "Giving a Face to a Name: De Man's Figures" [in her Decomposing Figures: Rhetorical Readings in the Romantic Tradition (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1986) 82-112], an essay that is particularly lucid and helpful in its account of de Man's use of certain rhetorical figures. Of anthropomorphism and prosopopoeia she observes: "Both strategies arise from the necessity to establish the phenomenality of the poetic voice, which is the principle of intelligibility (as we have seen de Man argue) not only of the lyric, but of language in general" [107].

[5.2.366]. What comes? Dost thou hear? Peace, break thee off! We may here briefly recall the idea of the promise. There must be affirmation, a "yes" which "must promise itself to itself... if anything is to come from the future." Such an affirmation calls up at least one other in Derrida's work. There is in his essay "Of an Apocalyptic Tone" the extraordinary description of the definitively "apocalyptic" enun- ciation, in an "affirmative tone," of the word "Come." Definitively apocalyptic, first because this is the word that comes, at the very end of the Bible, linking the end of the Book with the end of the world and with the Last Judgment, the revelation of God's truth: "He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus . . ." [Rev. 22:20]. And second, because in Derrida's account this "Come" announces "an apocalypse without apocalypse... without revelation... without sender or decidable addressee, without last judgment, without any other eschatology than the tone of the 'Come,' its very difference... it is in itself the apocalypse of the apocalypse" ["AT" 34-35]. This affirmative "Come" is elaborated as marking "in itself, in oneself, neither a desire nor an order, neither a prayer nor a request." This "'Come' cannot come from a voice or at least from a tone signifying 'I' or 'self"'; it is "a 'come' come from the other" ["AT" 34]. This otherness can never be present as such; rather it would be the condition of possibility and impossibility of the apocalyptic. "Come" becomes, finally, the tonal figure of a radical non-sense or otherness which may be "revealed" (if it were still possible to use that word) in all speech and writing. It is placeless and "insupportable" ["AT" 24]. It derives, but "only from the other, from nothing that may be an origin or a verifiable, decidable, presentable, appropriable identity" ["AT" 34]. Insofar as it can sound, it may connote a placelessness and disembodiment, an anonymity and dispersive multiplicity striking in the context of an analysis of the peculiar polyphony of a dramatic text. "Who's there?" [1.1.1]. Who is speaking or writing? Who is saying, "Come"? As Derrida also observes, "as soon as one no longer knows who speaks or who writes, the text becomes apocalyptic" ["AT" 27]. What comes in Hamlet? Generating and accumulating strangeness and apocalypticism, "Come" disseminates. Is it possible to hear it? "Come beyond being" ["AT" 34], as Derrida says: what would it be? In every act and virtually every scene: "this portentous figure / Comes" [1.1.112-13], "it cannot come to good" [1.2.158], "Would the night were come" [1.2.256], "Come your ways" [1.3.135], "To what issue will this come?" [1.4.89], "My hour is almost come" [1.5.2], "Come, bird, come" [1.5.118], "Come on" [1.5.159], "Come hither" [1.5.165], "But come" [1.5.176], "Nay, come" [1.5.198], "he comes before me" [2.1.84], "Come" [2.1.101], "Come, go we to the King" [2.1.117], "Come" [2.1.120], "Come, come, deal justly with me. Come, come. Nay, speak" [2.2.275-76]. Everything comes-to exceed the boundaries of any characterological or narratological description. What is the tone? "Come, give us a taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech" [2.2.427-28], "Come, sirs" [2.2.529], "Come" [3.2.107], "Come, some music; come, the recorders" [3.2.285]. Can one "avoid what is to come" [3.4.152]? "O come away" [4.1.28, 44], "till you come" [4.3.39], "But come" [4.3.51], "Come, my coach" [4.5.71-72], "When sorrows come, they come not single spies" [4.5.78], "Let come what comes" [4.5.135]. It, whatever it may be, envelops the very notion of revenge-Laertes's "my revenge will come" [4.7.29] only reiterates the apocalyptic "come" earlier pro- nounced by Hamlet: "Come, the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge" [3.2.247-48]. "It will come," as Albany says in King Lear [4.2.48]. And as Hamlet comes towards its "end," so "come," perhaps more than ever, touches the unnameable, the insupportable. "Come, my spade" [5.1.29], "To 'tagain, come" [5.1.49], "To this favour she must come" 52</page><page sequence="17">[5.1.188], "Peace, who comes here?" [5.2.80]. "Come": the contamination of sense and time, future and memory: "If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come.. ." [5.2.216-18]. And then the end-with all its "come"s-a kind of madness of mixing voices: "Come, Hamlet, come" [5.2.221], "Come, one for me" [5.2.251], "Come, begin" [5.2.275], "Come on, sir" [5.2.277], "Come, my lord" [5.2.278], "Come" [5.2.287], "Come, let me wipe thy face" [5.2.298], "Come for the third, Laertes" [5.2.301], "Say you so? Come on" [5.2.304] ... What does one scarcely hear? Does one finally hear anything? Or simply "nothing but ourselves" [3.4.135]? But what would this "nothing" be? Hamlet transmits these questions, like ghost-effects.... And what has been said with regard to mourning, and to "memory" or "the past," extends to nuclear war or nuclear catastrophe as well. In Memoires Derrida observes that the "inexistence of the past or of death, in other words their literal non-presence ... does not reduce mourning (before or after death) to the futility of an illusion" [M 87]. As for the nuclear catastrophe-however scandalous, intolerable, or impossible-we attend to its already having happened. In this respect I am suggesting a certain displacement and radicalization of the position reached by Martin Amis, elaborating on the work of Jonathan Schell, in his impassioned and powerful essay "Thinkability": "What we are experiencing [now], in as much as it can be experienced, is the experience of nuclear war. Because the anticipation-Schell again-the anxiety, the suspense, is the only experience of nuclear war that anyone is going to get" [17].8 It is not so much that it is happening but rather-like the structural necessity of our being in memory of our own deaths and of the deaths of others-it has already happened. It has already happened and we are already mourning. Thus Chemobyl was not, and cannot be monumentalized as, a warning or a temporary alarm: it is the coming of the future [see M 93], certainly, and this is unspeakably terrible, no doubt; but it is also what had already happened, and was already happening, as a nuclear "event." The notion of event here necessarily exceeds anything that might be contained within the rubric or horizon of "experience." Martin Amis's retention of this word (the "experience" of nuclear war), however qualified, is untenable. It would perhaps be especially misleading (and thus most easily recuperable) in the United States, where, as F. R. Jameson has pointed out, "Experience" is so consistently reified, being so much that "of which Americans have always made a fetish" [Jameson 126]. No longer of the order of "event" or "experience," we are returned (with a difference) to the time of the interval. We bear mourning for the nuclear catastrophe within ourselves, even if we acknowledge that there is no "true" "mourning" [M 29-30], and all the more so in the hypothesis of a remainderless destruction. The impossibility of mourning adumbrated here would be one way of trying to apprehend the notion of "nuclear criticism" as ghostlike. Following the logic of Nicolas Abraham's work, we could identify "impossible mourning" with the formation of a crypt. But in the hypothesis of remainderless destruction and of what Derrida refers to as "the absolute effacement of any possible trace" ["NA" 28], the thought of this impossible mourning could only ever be completely other. As the thought of impossible mourning for the absolute loss of mourning itself, it would be a matter less of a crypt than of a phantom or ghost, that is to say a haunting by the crypt of an other, in this case the unthinkable, unrepresentable crypt of what is absolutely other, of what could never be present.9 "Nuclear criticism" would be the ghostly discourse, the phantomatic prosopopoeia, in the name of this double, doubly impossible mourning which, neverthe- 8. I would like to thank Alan Brown for drawing my attention to Amis's essay. 9. For an account of the notion of phantom or ghost, as the uncanny phenomenon of being haunted by another's crypt, see Nicolas Abraham's "Notes on the Phantom: A Complement to Freud's Metapsychology," trans. Nicholas Rand, Critical Inquiry 13.2 (1987): 287-92. My remarks on the ghostlike here derive more from this essay, from Abraham and Torok's The Wolf Man's Magic Word: A Cryptonymy [Minneapolis: U of Minnesota P, 1986], andfrom Derrida's diacritics I spring 1990 53</page><page sequence="18">less, we necessarily bear within ourselves. Then what would be the sound, the soundless sound or "voice," of this force of mourning? Is it sound? To speak of the hypothesis of such sound immediately and simultane- ously entails two propositions: first, that this "sound" would no longer be thinkable within what we might describe as the auditorium of phonocentrism; and second, working through another homonym, another "sound" which cannot be differentiated by sound from "sound" as "sensation of hearing" or "transmitted disturbance perceptible by the ear," that this "sound" would no longer be thinkable within the confines of rationality or soundness of mind. Remaining with "sound," but being a-rational or para-rational, scarcely sound, or no longer entirely or simply sound, may we not then also try to conceive its radical and unassimilable non-sense in terms of the disseminatory and graphic force of other contexts and significations of "sound"? Thus to think mourning and monumen- talization, at the limit, in the home (one hypothetical, etymological "core" of Hamlet, ham or home)-the fictive hamlet or small community of texts or listeners, now, in the name of Hamlet: the homely and, in its core, the unhomely, the unheimlich. To cite Stevens again, from "The Auroras of Autumn": "Upstairs / The windows will be lighted, not the rooms": it too will be destroyed. What can one hear, hardly or barely hear? "Not a mouse stirring" [1.1.10]? "Indeed? I heard it not" [1.4.3-4]. Derrida speaks of "the being 'in us' of the other, in bereaved memory" and this regardless of whether the other is alive or dead [M 21-22]. This other, he says, "can be neither the so-called resurrection of the other himself... nor the simple inclusion of a narcissistic fantasy in a subjectivity that is closed upon itself or even identical to itself." Rather, he concludes: "Already installed in the narcissistic structure, the other so marks the self of the relationship to self, so conditions it that the being 'in us' of bereaved memory becomes the coming of the other, a coming of the other. And even, however terrifying this thought may be, the first coming of the other" [M 21-22]. This coming is also necessarily linked to the idea of the future, which is "a sort of monstrosity" and which "can only be anticipated in the form of an absolute danger" [Of Grammatology 5]. This monstrosity is most notoriously figured in Derrida's work in terms of the visual-for example, in terms of the "glimpse" and "glance" at "the formless, mute, infant, and terrifying form of monstrosity" [293], at the end of his essay "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences" (1966). I would like finally to suggest that we might also try, however impossibly, to think it in terms of "sound," in terms of the coming of the other, the coming of the sound of "come" as outlined here. It is a matter, then, of trying to remain with the thought of what has been offered here as the necessary chiasmus of the sound of "come" and the coming of "sound." "Sound" in accordance with its various supposed significations-for example, in Hamlet, where it occurs in the sense of measuring depth, desire or thought ("him would you sound" [2.1.43]), of music ("To sound what stop she pleaseth" [3.2.71] and "You would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass" [3.2.357-58]), and even, besides however many others, in the sense of fainting or having a fit, as when the Queen, dying, at the very end, "sounds to see them bleed" [Riverside 5.2.308]. "But stay, what noise?" [4.7.161]. Not a sound; "nothing but ourselves"... "But who, we?" ["Ends of Man" 136]. Then Hamlet makes it sound, without a sound. As de Man concludes, in "Autobiography As De-Facement": "Fors" (the Foreword to the Cryptonymy), than from Abraham's "The Phantom of Hamlet." Whereas, forAbraham, Hamlet'sfather is the other whose crypt (unspeakable secret) haunts young Hamlet's unconscious, my interest would be in the extent to which Hamlet as a text itself comes to figure both the other and the crypt, or what can be called the allo-cryptic. The question of the cryptic powers of literary texts would require much fuller treatment than I can provide here: for an excellent general introduction to this topic, see Esther Rashkin's "Toolsfor a New Psychoanalytic Literary Criticism." See also the reading ofWuthering Heights, for example, in my forthcoming Telepathy and Literature [Oxford: Blackwell, 1990]. 54</page><page sequence="19">"To the extent that language is... prosopopoeia... it is silent, mute as pictures are mute" [80]. Thus, once more, the ghostly dumb-show: "Anon comes in another.. .pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and leaves him" [Jenkins 296]. WORKS CITED Amis, Martin. "Introduction: Thinkability."
