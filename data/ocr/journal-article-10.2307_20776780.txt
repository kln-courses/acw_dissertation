<plain_text><page sequence="1">Typologies of the Theory of Behaviorism since Descartes By T. E. Weckowicz and Helen Liebel-Weckowicz 1. Introduction The modern Western mind has been shaped by several major ideas which emerged first in the early Enlightenment. Of foremost importance to it was Newton's discovery of the laws of motion which in turn inspired a new faith in progress. Neither of these exhaust the complex ities of the Scientific Revolution whose achievements inspired the new movements in philosophy.1 Often almost completely ignored by histo rians of thought is the theory of human behavior. From the more particular perspective of psychological science, behaviorism has in this century represented the dominant system of modern psychology and remains influential despite the recent gains made by cognitive psychology. As such, behaviorism is rooted in the seventeenth century Scientific Revolution. Its central idea, however, that of conditioning, stems from models of explanation which arise in post Darwinian biological science. 2. Two types of Behaviorism: Radical and Methodological Since the rise of the psychology of behavior in the seventeenth century, its development has been distinguished by two main lines of thought. The first is often called radical behaviorism. Based on a traditional materialist philosophy, its main emphasis lay in reducing all psychological phenomena to physical events alone. In this sense it was non-methodological since the assumption of an a priori materialist context rendered all consideration of methodological divisions superflu ous. Historians of psychology have left aside the problem of the antecedents of radical behaviorism, however, and describe it in terms of its modern formulation which is the work of /. B. Watson (1878-1962). For most of the twentieth century it has been Watson's radical behaviorism which has been historically important for modern social 1 A. R.

In contrast to Watson's, a second type of behaviorism has been described and given the technical term methodological behaviorism. Conceptually it derives from the empirical philosophy prevalent in Western thought since John Locke (1632-1704). Empirical, though not necessarily materialistic, it has also been influenced by positivism. It is usual to find scientific objectivism emphasized in its approach to the study of psychological phenomena. In its modern form radical behaviorism rejected the assumptions made by Descartes and Leibniz of a distinct mind-body division. Its advocates argued, instead, that psychological phenomena could be reduced to reflexes of the central nervous system and the physical events which stimulated them. Real events of the external world were conceived as occurring in the nervous system and in the muscles of the behaving organism. That important paradigm of modern science which holds that matter and energy is divisible into electrons, protons, and electrical forces which constitute an ultimate reality, underlies the modern versions of this theory. Consciousness, so important for realizing the meaning of the stream of occurring events could be viewed as a mere epiphenomenon. It seemed to lie outside of the framework of the material world which man was able to represent to the mind. The material world alone constituted an ultimate reality. Therefore science must be concerned only with material phenomena. Methodological behaviorism avoided metaphysical committments altogether. Its rigorous empiricism made it necessary to accept as axiomatic the principle that science qua science, was necessarily con cerned with phenomena which could be objectively established. Yet its adherents were thinking in terms of two schools of philosophy of science: a) European logical positivism, and b) American operationalim. These used different approaches to the problem of defining objectivity. In spite of such variations a common ground remained for radical and methodological behaviorism in that both stressed ideas about environ ment which were independent of the philosophical assumptions of either school. Environment, in contrast to heredity, played a prominent role in any explanation of the behavior of organisms. As a necessary adjunct, it followed that much prominence was to be given to the importance of learning in explaining the way in which the organism adapted to its environment. The focus on environment which has been prominent in the twentieht century can be attributed to both the influence of Darwinism and American pragmatism in modern thought.</page><page sequence="3">Typologies of the Theory of Behaviorism since Descartes 131 3. The philosophical schools associated with behaviorism Several other concepts which derived from the European cultural tradition were deemed essential for representing the dynamic internal structure of behavior. These were important in all schools of behavior ism. Foremost was 1) atomism, which involved the study of component elements not forming concrete structures. In behaviorism it was the atomism of the reflexes, of the stimuli and responses, which provided the basic units of behavior. Then, 2) associationism, and 3) hedonism, as well as 4) functionalism were important concepts. Important for functional ism in particular was the influence of Darwinism which held that the survival of the organism of the species was the purpose of behavior. It is important to observe that all of these conceptions implied that behavior could be analyzed into elementary units categorized as either a) reflexes, or b) stimulus-response connections. The latter were termed S-R units. The entire system of their relationships was viewed as the result of contingent or non-predictable conditions. These were usually the result of association or reinforcement. The behavioral pattern established by an S-R relation was reinforced by a system of reward and punishment. 4. The philosophical antecedents of behaviorism Historically, the philosophical antecedents of behaviorism show the remote influence of the earliest Greek reductionist schools of Demo critus and other Greek atomists. These ideas had a continuing influence because they were revived during the Renaissance and remained conspicuous during the Enlightenment, and in the nineteenth century. However, in their modern form they were much modified by the Scientific Revolution. Here it was the empiricism and the emphasis of Sir Francis Bacon on inductive reasoning which provided the initial stimulus. Taken in conjunction with the new theoretical formulations made in physics and astronomy by Galileo, Kepler and Newton, the new empiricism also produced a new paradigm for natural science. Still prevalent and co-existent with it was the Aristotelian teleology which it was to replace. Aristotle's inclusion of final and formal causes had regained its ancient popularity in scholastic philosophy. The new science only accepted his conception of antecedent causes and discarded his notion of final cause. Since the structure of the context of events which he included in his theory of causation could now be ignored, the physical world was analyzed into its elementary events. Descartes applied this</page><page sequence="4">132 T. E. Weckowicz and Helen Liebel-Weckowicz scheme to the analysis of human behavior according to its simplest component events. 5. The Cartesian conception of man Cartesianism represented a break with the Renaissance neo-Platonist science. Like many thinkers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Descartes also believed that the science of the ancients was defective. In consequence, the new scientists argued in favor of a new type of analysis. Descartes especially found the psychological works of ancient writers to be dubious. He drew the conclusion that this obliged him to discuss the nature of human passions as if no one had ever treated the subject before.2 The resulting theory developed in his Passion de Vame (1649), and his Traite de Vhomme (1662) which were intended to provide a system to replace that of ancient philosophy. It turned out to be entirely mechanistic. God, Descartes reasoned, had made man only a little less contrived than the machines used to power the fountains in royal gardens. Basically Descartes still accepted Galen's belief that animal spirits moved the blood which contained humors. These were the forces which moved it. The "more subtle parts" of the blood went to the head and the stronger and more lively parts to the organs of reproduction. The parts of the blood which penetrated the brain not only served to nourish it, but mainly produced a certain very subtle breeze in the head. Perhaps this was also a very lively excitation which could be attributed to esprits animaux. Such esprits were entirely material, however, and for Descartes they were neither mysterious nor anthropomorphic forces.3 The exact description of how these spirits entered and influenced the nerves depended on the classical model of the soul. Certainly Descartes had begun with the assumption that man was composed of a body and a soul.4 Yet the ancient Greek idea of two separate souls, one a bodily soul, and one divine, remained among his main suppositions. The Greeks had identified consciousness with passions, and located it in the thymos, an organ sometimes described as being in the lungs, and sometimes in the heart. Unlike the psyche, the thymos constituted a mortal soul which died with the body. In contrast, the immortality and 2 W.

In the Roman Empire it was later seen by Virgil as the god who pervaded the universe, and from whom all creatures "derive at birth the slight, precarious breath of life."7 The ancient conception of a divine psyche had reappeared in Renaissance neo-Platonism and had influenced seventeenth century science. However original Descartes tried to be, he did still assume the latent dualism of the soul of ancient philosophers and this provided the substrate for the body-mind cleavage of Cartesian anthropology. For Descartes, animal spirits formed in the blood and were then given warmth and speed, in the heart. The blood vessels refined them as they rose to the brain. The grosser spirits stopped at the brain surface which they nourished. The finer ones continued to the interior. Still other animal spirits originated externally and came through the pores to the nervous system where they helped cause the local motion of the muscles. In this way the movements of man were conceptualized in a thoroughly mechanical way.8 It is important to observe that Descartes still conceived of motion in a medieval way, as something which originated from within the substance which moved. The animal spirits were the internal force which caused the sense organs to function. They moved both the muscles and the nerves.9 The strength of the animal spirits also caused them to force open passages so that they flowed from one muscle to another. The stronger spirits overcame weaker ones already in the muscle, and this accounted for local movements. The stronger took over the function of the weaker ones, who had failed to perform, and this caused the mucle to flex or become flaccid.10 5 Edward G. Bollard: Philosophy at the Crossroads.

Weckowicz and Helen Liebel-Weckowicz Descartes' description of body function was based in part on the level of knowledge attained from anatomical dissections by the middle of the seventeenth century. Animal spirits seemed only to represent something that actually existed, but could not be used to explain the phenomenon of life itself. This was certainly more generally a "phenomenon of being, instead of something that is," as Husserl observed of Descartes.11 Descartes had reduced his system to a division of the existing substances to two: res extensa (Matter), and res cogitans (Thought). The dualism proposed by such a division was intended to overcome the mind-body division because it postulated a control of material substances by the influence of mind substance. Descartes insisted that the distinction between mind and body was real.12 This added to the mystery of the soul, which only man possessed. Animals were "mere machines," lacking in soul and consciousness. Human bodies too, resembled animal ones. Yet in his voluntary movements, man acted according to the conse quences of his thoughts. Such motions were not thought, yet depended on thought as causation. The soul could control the body through the mediation of the pineal gland, or so Descartes hypothesized. Here was a steering mechanism, a rudder. Sensory information could be concen trated in it.14 How sensory information was received depended on mechanical force. Consciousness did not enter into the process. Following the ancient theory of Democritus, the external activating force consisted of tiny bits of matter which wer assumed to make up the real world. These made their way through the pores into the nervous system itself. Such minute particles emanated from real substances such as fire. They entered the pores and travelled up to the brain cavity where they activated the animal spirits located there. These streamed in force to the muscle and caused the foot to be withdrawn. The non-conscious and automatic nature of this process has led to the observation that Descartes might have anticipated the idea of a reflex action.

He realized that it was through the nerves that God gave this human machine the ability to have sentient feelings.16 In essence, however, the system acts mechanistically and any real percep tion of feeling takes place only in the soul.17 The body submits to the soul. If the soul is overcome by ecstasy, the body actually ceases to feel anything. The Cartesian explanation of feeling was related to a distinct conception of the distribution of nerves and animal spirits. Emotions were divided into two large categories. The first was constituted by man's natural appetites; namely the sensations arising from the digestive process. The second involved the nerves to the heart. (Recall the Greek thymos). Together they embraced not only emotions perceived in the mind, but also passions and affections.18 In an early kind of associationist theory, Descartes used topical categories to describe emotions. Cheer fulness, for example, could be explained by brain movements which were induced by animal spirits which had been warmed by strong dilations of the heart and then risen to the head. The Cartesian theory proved to be full of inconsistencies, however, because different kinds of emotions had different origins. The idea of joy did not even arise in the body, but was produced by an idea in motion between understanding and imagination. Its oscillations presumably stimulated a flow of animal spirits from the brain to the heart muscles. The sensations emanating from the heart to the nerves communicated a sensation of joy to the brain.19 Seemingly more purely spiritual than his theory of emotions, was Descartes' idea of conscious thought processes. Thinking was a function of the soul and involved either a pure activity of the soul or a special dynamism attributed to it which he referred to as its passions. The 15 Descartes'.

Desire was independent of external sensations in contrast to passion which depended on sense experience. The soul was linked to the body by the stimuli of ideas which arose from the external world and then meshed with a feedback mechanism that was moved by innate ideas. These were also pure ideas. They existed only in the soul, but could be summoned up by the mind and sent out to effect real physical behavior in the external world. However baroque such a theory, the innate ideas and the pure ones represented remnants of the existing theological tradition and showed the persistence of Platonic influences. The most important pure idea was the will to love God. The soul exists in its own realm but can communicate ideas to direct the individual through his mind which engages in thought in order to produce ideas. Ideas exist as a modification of the mind's own substance: thought.20 6. Locke and Post-Cartesian development Descartes still manifested strong scholastic roots when he assumed that whatever a man sensed was real.21 It was this assumption which provided the main target for attack by the anti-Cartesians. The most important of these was Simon Foucher (1644-1696), whose attack made possible Locke's new psychology. Yet as is usual when there is a major breakthrough in science, many elements of the older theory continued to be uncritically accepted and remained as elements of the new one. Certainly the idea of animal spirits was now discarded. But Locke continued to accept the basic division made in both Descartes' psycho logy and in scholasticism between primary and secondary qualities. For the scholastics, however, all qualities were sensible ones. In contrast, both Descartes and Locke distinguished two basic types of qualities. First, quantitative ones, construed to be objective. Secondly, subjective ones, which were related to sense experience. Both also argued that primary or quantitative qualities inhered in the object and could be immediately recognized by the normal human community of observers. Secondary qualities such as color, existed as subjective sensations.22 20 Descartes: Passions of the Soul. P. 340. Richard A. Watson: The Downfall of Cartesianism, 1673-1712. The Hague 1966.

Descartes had known of Harvey's theory of the circulation of the blood (1619) but had not really absorbed it. Once the circulation theory was generally accepted, the idea of animal spirits could no longer be justified. Brain anatomy too had made advances. In England Thomas Willis (1622-1675) had published a major study of the brain and of the anatomy of brain nerves in 1664: Cerebri anatomi cui accessit nervoram descriptio et us us. Twenty years later the famous French physician R. de Vieussens (1641-1715) published a profusely illustrated study of the nervous system, the Neurologia universales, which was based on over 500 dissections.23 Locke, also a physician, made use of the new level of brain and nerve research in order to offer a theory of behavior. Locke's contribution lies partly in the fact that he created a new system to fill the gap left when animal spirits were discredited. Locke's system has endured in some ways and still serves as a foundation for methodological behaviorism and the empirical view of behavior. Locke's major work, the Essay on Human Understanding, inquired into the origin of ideas in the conscious mind. He began with the assumption that no ideas are innate.24 All the materials of reason and knowledge arose from experience alone. Experience was not the simple result of external stimuli, as it was to be in the materialist theories of the next two centuries. Sensation was explained as only one source of thinking activity. In itself sensation was subjective and perceived were only secondary qualities. The internal processing of material and immaterial stimuli which Descartes had described simply as the "desires of the soul", became reflections in Locke's system. All experience in fact drew on reflection. Even passions were related by a need to satisfy thought by experience. Some arose from reflection on experience.25 Although Locke rejected the idea of animal spirits, he still accepted the corpuscular theory of the universe so that the entire process of nerve stimulation depended on the actual transmission of tiny particles which came from the object perceived. This was true only for objects having secondary qualities, however, for the measurable, primary qualities were not communicated by particles. Somehow their wave-like motions 23 ?mile Guyenot: Les Sciences de la Vie aux XVIIe et XVIIIe Siecles. L'Idee devolution. Paris 1957.

Weckowicz and Helen Liebel-Weckowicz influenced the eyes and the optic nerve and communicated objective knowledge.26 Locke assumed that whatever was conveyed to the mind by experi ence had to be correct information. Sensations had to be accurate. If snow was white, the mind correctly perceived the whiteness. The explanation of this assumed a universe in which man was moved by forces and powers outside of himself which had an effect on him, internally, psychologically. The complex ideas which the mind created out of simpler constituents, resulted from its own combinations and were not copies of real external objects. They needed to be only mathematically true, not subjectively so.27 Locke's theory made it impossible to base all behavioral explanations on the innate ideas of the soul. Psychologists became more interested in how man knows, than in metaphysics.28 7. The French Enlightenment and Materialism In its search for new truth, the French Enlightenment, which had turned against Cartesian rationalism, accepted the new English psycho logy. Etienne Bonnot, Abbe Condillac (1714-1780), was like Locke, concerned with the materials of human knowledge rather than with soul mechanics. Only Jean Jacques Rousseau retained the more archaic interest in the "simplest operations of the soul."29 Condillac agreed with Locke that the mind knows only because of sense experience. He rejected Locke's view that ideas could arise from either reflection or sensation, and emphasized the sensory input entirely. Sensation alone modified consciousness and all knowledge of the external world. The sense of touch in particular tied man to the real world. Even memory was only a transformation of sensory input. Judgment resulted from the comparison of sensations. It was difficult to postulate knowledge in terms of the old realism because men only perceived their own thoughts, thoughts which resulted from the influence of external stimuli.30 26 Ibid.

This is also the argument of his major work, UHomme Machine (1748). Above all, he attacked the concept of the soul. It was a vain term which could refer only to that part of us which thinks. The parts that had feeling and those which thought could be explained by motion alone. He drew his mechanistic ideas to their ultimate conclusion and believed that the new physiology of the eighteenth century demonstrated this principle as well. He pointed to the fact that a frog's heart continued to beat even when removed from the body.31 If the idea of the soul could no longer be used to explain behavior, then what did? A leader in the Enlightenment movement and one who was concerned with finding the answer to this question, was Claude Adrien Helvetius (1715-1771). He wholeheartedly accepted Locke's tabula rasa and reduced all knowledge to experience. In denying the possibility of any innate capacities, ideas, or abilities, he postulated a rather mechanical physical sensibility which mediated not only ideas but judgments as well. In his De PEsprit (1758) and other works, Helvetius went even further. Like Descartes he placed great importance on human passions. But he gave them a more modern formulation so that passions were viewed as motivating forces. They could be used to harness and potentiate ideas. Some men could thus better achieve their potential than others, but all had an equal emotional ability. Paul-Henri Thiry Baron d'Holbach (1723-1789), another sensationist, went even further than Helvetius and developed the idea that a new social science was to be established according to principles of psycho logy. The most important of these were to be enlightened self-interest and the useful application of passions to social behavior. His Systeme de la Nature, ou des Lois du monde physique et du monde moral (1770) presented man as a natural organism stimulated to movement and thought by sensibilite. The idea of the soul could be dismissed as illusionary. Yet this same creature could be stimulated by his senses to terror and superstitious beliefs as well as to utilitarian ideas which could improve his lot.32 31 Julien Offray de La Mettrie: Man a Machine.

Weckowicz and Helen Liebel-Weckowicz The most important materialist to emerge from the Helvetius Holbach circle was Pierre Jean George Cabanis (1757-1808), a leader of the social science reformers who appeared during the French revolutio nary era. A quasi positivist, he followed d'Holbach's footsteps and tried to raise moral philosophy to the status of a natural science. As social science it belonged to physics. His Rapports du physique et du moral was concerned with the effect of illnesses on ideas and moral affect, a subject important in Romantic literature. Nervous affections proceeding from the organs of generation produced exaltation and ecstases, even hyp chondriasis, fears, and sadness. Illnesses could produce degeneration because of mood change. They could affect reason and the habits of the will. However, a secret but healthy life drive reasserted itself periodically and weakened the destructive forces of nature which opposed change for the better.33 The idea that the behavior of an organism could be transformed and modified by change had appeared during the Enlightenment in the work of Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buff on (1707-1788). In a monumen tal study of Natural History, he argued that nature was in continual flux and the forms of nature subject to change. A species could no longer be viewed as unalterable, and presumably this applied to the human one as well. Climate also influenced change. Like the materialists, Buffon stressed the importance of natural causation. In contrast to the reduction of environmental factors arising in nature and from heredity of the sensationists, Buffon anticipated many features of Darwin's theory of evolution.34 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), the German philosopher, had similarly believed that organic bodies were capable of variation and transformation and that they were controlled by underlying laws of continuity and operation. Even before Darwin then, the idea began to gain acceptance that creatures could appear according to stages of evolution.

Still, in Germany, Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803), had already discussed the possible connection between man and ape with his friend Goethe in the 1780's. Both rejected the idea that man descended from an ape, a theory proposed in Italy at that time. As a representative of the early German Romantics, Herder rejected the bare materialism of the French sensationists and was concerned with the question of human uniqueness. Man stood erect, and this made it possible for him to support, physically, the sort of nervous system which could produce rational behavior. Yet emotions preceded rational thought. As the true perception of reality could not be fragmented, no simple reaction to sensation or purely rational reflection could adequately explain behavior or thought.35 8. Eighteenth century British empiricists British empiricists and associationists, particularly David Hume (1711-1776) and David Hartley (1705-1757) took the same direction as the French materialists and gave British psychology its utilitarian bent. Hume believed that all human behavior could be subsumed under natural law. There was a uniformity in human nature which could be used to account for the similarity of action and beliefs. Human passions were the same the world around, and this explained the association of ideas which took place as much as planetary motion could be explained by gravity. Associations now replaced desires and sensations as explana tions of behavior. Hume denied the independence of a thinking mind, however, and sought to organize the jumble of sense impressions in terms of random associations of ideas. These could be linked to impressions made by passions. Passions were more than sensations. They could be defined by values and ideas common to all societies and ages. The important values that Hume emphasized included categories 35 Dr. J. H. F. Kohlbriigge: Herders Verhaltnis zu modernen Naturanschauungen. Die Naturwissenschaften Bd. 1 Nr. 46 (1913), 1110-1116.

Development of Neurophysiology The research into physiology of the nervous system done at the end of the eighteenth century made possible a completely new theory of behavior. Albrecht von Hatter (1708-1777), building on the work of Hermann Boerhave of Leyden, developed a concept of the spinal reflex. In 1784 he postulated an involuntary local action which he called the vis insita. In consequence, and also in 1784, George Prochaska argued in his De functionibus systematis nervosi, that a nerve function existed throughout the nervous system which accounted for the activity of the brain and spinal cord. This was termed, sensorium commune?7 In England, David Hartley (1705-1757) had already proposed an explana tion of nerve dynamics in terms of the vibrations of brain particles. However, this was not far removed from seventeenth century corpuscu lar theories.38 The major breakthrough in British physiological experimentation came with the work of Marshall Hall (1790-1857). It was Hall who distinguished the reflex as separate from three other kinds of bodily movements. In the first place, it was neither a conscious nor a voluntary action. Unlike other involuntary bodily movements it seemed not to be related to any brain activity of the cerebrum, or medulla. The Europeans were reluctant to accept this theory because it refuted the still acceptable Aristotelian idea that consciousness existed in all parts of the nervous system. The French physiologists too, had developed an idea of animal sensibility which Xavier Bichat (1771-1802) thought to be distributed between a receiving organ, a transmitting nerve, and the receptor brain.40 These studies were popularized by Claude Bernard (1813?1878), who had been greatly influenced by Bichat's disciple, Francois Magendie (1783-1855). Bernard's own student, A. Mosso, continued the mechanis tic approach to behavior with a theory that emotions represented a discharge of energy, an idea which has continued to influence 37 Edwin G.

The Theory of Evolution The British empiricist school was less concerned with energy than in establishing man's relationship to the animal world. Charles Darwin (1809-1882) published his theory of evolution in The Origin of Species in 1859. The basic principles enunciated were also important for the theory of behavior because they established a continuity between man and animal. Certainly eighteenth century thinkers, particularly Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) had regarded man as belonging to the natural order and had argued that his social nature could be studied according to the laws of nature. Darwin's positivism went further. In comparing the social life of man and animal in his Descent of Man (1871), Darwin argued that even man's mental functioning could be treated biologi cally.41 The tendency to revert to a mechanistic view of emotions promoted the development of radical behaviorism. Darwin's Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals represented the first scientific study of this subject. Why were emotional responses to particular actions not also responses to other actions ? For Darwin the answer was historical and lay deeply rooted in the evolution of the species. The physiology of emotion represented a pathology of past states of struggle for survival of archaic and primitive components.42 These theories were more likely to influence methodological behaviorism rather than the radical type. The science of the mid-nineteenth century also produced a new kind of S-R psychology which emerged from researches into psycho-physics, a new field created by Gustav Theodor Fechner. It was Fechner who developed the measurement techniques applied to the study of the physical stimuli presented to the senses. These were found to be measurable in terms of the change in intensity of stimuli which could be presented mathemati cally. The change in stimuli was thus equal to a constant times the change in stimuli over the quantum of the stimuli.43 41 On Kant's psychology see Brett (1912-1921), vol. 2. P. 337-350.

Russian reflexology By quantifying mental phenomena, psycho-physics made possible the sort of radical behaviorism which became characteristic in the early twentieth century, of many aspects of both Soviet and American social science. It was psycho-physics, for example, which made possible the psychology of reflexes which became characteristic of Russian psycho logy. The Russian school of reflexology was founded by /. M. Schenov (1829-1905), and is described in his Reflexes of the Brain (1863). Predominantly a new type of mechanistic theory, it reduced all thinking to stimulation. Both acts of consciousness and unconsciousness were reduced to reflexes. Schenov's most prominent follower was I. P. Pavlov (1849-1936). It was Pavlov who discovered the conditioned reflex. The main idea here was that unconscious movement represented learned behavior.44 The conclusion which Pavlov drew from this was that the technique of the conditioned reflex provided the proper ground for the investigation of higher nervous activity, especially in the cerebral cortex. V. Af. Bechterev (1857-1927), another member of this school was more philosophical. The conditioned reflex would become the basis of the new objective psychology or study of human reflexology. These behaviorists continued some older streams of mechanistic thinking and ignored the evolutionary questions raised by Darwinism.45 44 Boring (1957), 39. Brett (1912-1921), vol. 3. P. 272. Schechenov argued (1863) that "simple psychological processes must be taken as the basis of psychology." On Pavlov, see the biographical sketch by W. H. Gantt in Ivan P. Pavolv: Lectures on Conditioned Reflexes. Vol. 1. Trans. W. H. Gantt. New York 1928 5th printing 1963. P. llff. Pavlov sought to reduce psychology to brain physiology, itself representing a reduction to excitation and inhibition of stimuli, in order to make psychology into a true science. While the unconditioned reflex involved unvarying responses, the conditioned one involved variation and malleability of natural capacity. See Pavlov. The Pure Physiology of the Brain.

Other European schools of psychology In both France and Germany physiologists produced new mechanistic theories. Jacques Loeb in France emphasized the mechanisms of tropisms and reflex behavior/ Whatever underlying forces existed to account for tropisms had to be related to physico-chemical changes.46 In Germany and Austria, the new school of physiology also propounded essentially mechanistic theories centred on the study of neuronal and conditioned reflexes. Amongst its leaders were E. Brucke, T. Meynert, and S. Exner, who were Freud's teachers. Freud himself wrote, but never published a Project for a Scientific Psychology, which shows how strongly his early theories are linked to neuro-physiological founda tions. He argued that most human motives could be explained neurolog ically. This could apply to some forms of thought as well.47 Freud also reflected the influence of scholastic philosophy which at that time enjoyed a revival in Central Europe. This influence had been mediated by Franz Brentano at the University of Vienna, one of Freud's teachers, who argued that human action was reducible to mind-action and as such was intentional. The mind intends an object. Intended and non-existent objects were thus immanent in consciousness.48 13. Positivism and operationism Mind itself was an important subject for the positivist school of philosophy which had also appeared by the century's mid-point and that was to have a significant influence on social science thinking.

Auguste Comte, the French founder of this movement, could thus be credited with ending the influence of Cartesian metaphysics. For Comte, events in the brain could be observable even if experience was not. Yet Comte remained anti empirical, largely because he considered empirical inference limited by the socio-historical framework of empirical observation. The latter was itself a dubious category. He believed its usefulness was restricted.49. A more empirical positivism emerged from the work of Ernst Mach (1838-1916), whose intention was to return to the obsercational ultimate, namely the sensory datum. This was embedded in experience and not in social data as such.50 The Vienna Circle of the 1920's and 1930's further modified the long accepted idea that sensory phenomena constituted the pre-inferential basic data of scientific observations and measurement operations. Physical events could provide an alternative data base. Percy William Bridgman (1882-1962), developed a similar view in his operationism. More stress was placed on the instrumental operations than on the intrinsic meaning of concepts. Operational analysis was in this way to provide a defence against unsound or meaningless propositions since they could not stand up to a really performable and instrumental operation.51 14. Comparative psychology The need for an objective methodology of behaviorism had also been brought into focus by the development of animal psychology after Darwin. Darwin himself had conceptualized life as a form of behavior. 49 Boring (1957), 632-633. Comte in general rejected psychology and believed that all types of introspection led to self deception. Physiology alone offered the way to psychological truth. Psychology could not provide the foundation of social science at all.

This was an essentially instrumentalist view which was later important in the philosophy of John Dewey. For Darwin, the essential nature of an animal lay not in its form, a concept derived from Aristotle, nor in its idea, as in Plato, but in its being a type of living behavior. Ultimately, all characteristics of life were a consequence of environment.52 A follower of Darwin, C. Lloyd Morgan (1852-1936), developed a behaviorist animal psychology in his works, Animal Behavior (1900) and Comparative Psychology (1894). In spite of his mechanistic emphasis, he attributed consciousness to animals, especially to higher animals. They obviously had memory and could associate things. Only lower animals were really unconscious. At that level behavior was a function of instinct. Even in the higher man, Lotze had observed, "the instinctual does not appear to have been annihilated in the human soul, rather to have been pushed just one step back."53 William McDougall (1871-1938), an Oxford psychologist who migrated to the United States, used the Darwinist vogue to bring instincts back into fashion. Certainly he was to become a leading antagonist of behaviorism. McDougall argued that human behavior not only resulted primarily from instincts, but even that all emotions could be reduced to the three basic instincts of fear, repulsion, and anger.54 15. American functionalism Modern behaviorist psychology owes a great deal to the development of European thought since Descartes. True.

In Body and Mind, (p. 264) he makes it clear that higher animals and man show instinctive reactions which seem remote from simple impressions and are not reconcilable with the notion of "compound reflex action of a mechanical type."

Weckowicz and Helen Liebel-Weckowicz uniquely American type of psychology about 1900, derived from American adaptations of the empiricist tradition in philosophy as well as from its native functionalist psychology. The descriptive study of consciousness was rejected in favor of understanding its function. Centred at Chicago and Columbia, the main interest of the functionalist school was in developmental and comparative psychology. A primary shift to functionalism was effected by James McKeen Cattell,55 who ignored the sensory content of consciousness and favored research into the function of sensory discrimination and response error. Another functionalist was John Dewey, whose classic paper on the reflex (1896) already assumed the idea of a modern feed-back system. /. B. Watson, the founder of radical behaviorism, was the doctoral student of the Columbia functionalist, James Angell (1869-1949), who defined func tionalism as the psychology of mind operations. Angell was concerned with the role of consciousness in situations of challenge requiring the organism to produce a new adaptation. His student, J. B. Watson, rejected the introspective study of consciousness as unscientific and substituted for it an objective study of behavior. Once Dewey had moved to Columbia in the 1920's however, functionalism was turned towards the needs of educational psychology. Important here was the leadership of Columbia's James McKeen Cattell, who had studied with Wilhelm Wundt at Leipzig.56 The concern with education contributed to producing still another approach to behavior, that of the modern mental and social measurement of psychology. Founded by Edward Lee Thorndike (1874-1949), also of Columbia, the mental testing movement has tended to develop towards a counter egalitarian philosophy in the past two decades. It draws on the traditions of genetics derived from fat Social Darwinism of Francis Galton who had emphasized a belief in innate abilities and in the biological inequality among men. Those who believed in the biological foundations of individual variation try to apply testing in such ways as to demonstrate this hypothesis. In contrast, /. B. Watson adopted an 55 On Cattell see A.

It is conceded that cultural and environ mental factors may obscure innate qualities if these exist. If optimal social conditions prevail, such effects would then be negligible.58 16. The social impact of behaviorism Psychology has itself become a social force of considerable magnitude. It can itself influence the development of industrial civilization. As a subculture in modern society it has provided an ideology which has dominated a good part of the twentieth century. Haunted by the specter of the machine age, of a technological society controlled by social engineers, the psychologically oriented intellectual found small comfort in Watson's radical behaviorism and instead turned to phenomenology and existentialism. From this perspective then, behaviorism has had a profound effect on the development of the contemporary world. Through its influence on the education sector and on the development of social science it has exerted a profound effect on the making of modern society. Its 57 John B. Watson: Behaviorism.

Zusammenfassung Der Beitrag liefert eine Begriffsgeschichte des Behaviorismus, welche die philosophischen Grundlagen dieser modernen psychologischen Richtung bis ins 17. Jahrhundert erforscht. Urspriinglich nur als Bezeichnung der amerikanischen Schule der S-R (Reiz-Reaktion) Psychologie eingefuhrt, die von J. B. Watson begriindet war, werden hier zwei Typen des modernen Behaviorismus unterschieden. Erstens, der radikale B. der Watson Schule, welche auf rein mechanistischen und materialistischen Grundlagen beruhte. Zweitens, der methodologische Behaviorismus, der sich aus einer empiricistischen Weltanschauung entwickelte. Rene Descartes und John Locke werden als Griinder dieser Richtungen angesehen. Descartes' Theorie des menschlichen Handelns und die Rolle der Seele, Leidenschaften, Neigungen usw. wurden aber noch von der aus der Antike uberlieferten Idee der esprits animaux beherrscht. John Locke entwickelte eine neue Psychologie aus der empirischen Weltanschauung seiner Zeit und nahm an, dafi alle Gefiihle wahre Gegenstande der Umwelt durch Erlebnisse und Erfahrungen vermittelten. Diese wurzelten aber nie in einer Inharenz der Ideen sondern ruhten nur auf menschlichen Reflexionen. Die Entwicklung des radikalen Behaviorismus wurde nun von den franzosischen Sensationisten (Condillac, La Mettrie, Helvetius, D'Hol bach) gepragt, deren rein materialistische Auffassung aller Bewufkseins gegenstande auch von dem franzosischen Positivismus aufgenommen wurde. Die empiricistische Richtung aber miindete in die Entwicklung der Nervenforschung und Physiologie, wo man allmahlich ein Verstand nis der bedingten und unbedingten Reflexe gewann. Der Darwinismus und die Forschungen auf dem Gebiet der Tier-Psychologie spielten ebenfalls eine Rolle. Im 20. Jahrhundert dann nahm Watson diese Strdmungen auf und schlug vor, er konne alle menschlichen Handlungs weisen von einer Reiz-Reaktionstheorie ableiten. Diese wurde eine herrschende Weltanschauung, die mit der modernen Kultur sehr tief verbunden ist. Ihre Gegner bieten aber auch eine moderne psychologische Theorie, die auf dem methodologischen Behaviorismus beruht. Zu diesen gehoren die Schulen des amerikanischen Funktionalis mus, sowie der padagogischen Psychologie, die als Umweltanpassung</page><page sequence="23">Typologies of the Theory of Behaviorism since Descartes 151 die menschliche Lernfahigkeit sehr betont und den reinen Mechanismus ablehnt. Anhanger dieser Bewegung waren James Angell, John Dewey, Thorndike, usw. Auch McDougall, der die Instinkttheorie wieder hervorbrachte, lehnte den radikalen Behaviorismus ab.
