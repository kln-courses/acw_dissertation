In Little Annie Rooney' the comic artist has a character say, "My late husband was a horticulturist-specializing in alfalfa." Either the artist thought alfalfa was a fruit or a vege- table or he did not know that hortus meant "garden" and that the etymological meaning of horticulture has been retained. Again, Gus Edson, the successor of Sidney Smith, who created The Gumps, in a Sunday edition"' where six scenes are devoted to Andy Gump's picturing to Chester six of Chester's illustrious forebears, ap- parently intended a chronological sequence, for the last four heroes are arranged in the following order: Bimulus Gump with Columbus, Sir Archibald Gump with Wellington, Grandfather Beamish Gump at San Juan Hill, and Andy himself in the First World War. But scenes one and two show respectively, Hannibal Gump crossing the Alps and Horatius Gump defending the bridge. For the chrono- logical sequence to have been kept, Horatius (507 B.c.) Gump should have preceded Hannibal (218 B.c.) Gump. Where shall we be when the Pharaoh of "Progressive" education that knows not the Joseph of our cultural past rises to even greater prominence?

THE BLINDING RADIANCE OF THE DIVINE VISAGE In the issue of Life for July 10, 1939, page 49, the caption of a picture of Emperor Hirohito taking a drive in a carriage reads in part as follows: "When the Emperor rides out, all shades are drawn along the way; nobody is permitted to look down on him; in fact, nobody is supposed to look at him at all. A direct look may blind one." Similar ideas about the impropriety of looking at persons of high rank may be found in The Talisman, a tale of the Near East, by Sir Walter Scott. When the Scottish knight Sir Kenneth ap- peared before King Richard in the guise of a Nubian slave he took</page><page sequence="2">486 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL good care to act his part. "It was perhaps well for him that the preservation of his character required his eyes to be fixed on the ground, since the keen glance with which Richard for some time surveyed him in silence would, if fully encountered, have been difficult to withstand" (Chap. XXV). Four sentences of like im- port occur in Chapters XXVII and XXVIII. Naturally the reverence that mortals show to deities is pat- terned in some measure after their deferential treatment of exalted human beings, especially royal personages, and it has become almost a commonplace that the eyes of men cannot stand the sight of a deity.' As far back as Homer's time the gods were awe-inspir- ing when they manifested themselves to men.2 It is related that the appearance of Apollo before the Argonauts caused them to bend their heads down, for no one presumed to look into the eyes of the god.3 Phaethon was just as prudent on entering his divine father's halls: Protinus ad patrios sua fert vestigia vultus consistitque procul; neque enim propiora ferebat lumina.4 When Semele besought her lover Zeus to appear to her as he was wont to do before Hera, he carefully explained that a mortal could in no wise endure the sight of a god; but she persisted and so brought death upon herself.5 It was a law of Cronus that whoever beheld the immortals with- out their consent should pay a heavy penalty." Julius Proculus was acting in accordance with tradition when, standing in awe (perfusus horrore venerabundus) before the deified Romulus, who had de- scended from heaven, he prayerfully asked ut contra intueri fas esset.7 According to one version of a well-known story, Athena blinded Tiresias because he had chanced to see her at the bath.8 In speaking of the gods, who bestow their blessings upon mankind 1 Cf.

In this connection it is again pertinent to quote from Life (for June 10, 1940, p. 70): "If you are Japanese, it actually hurts your eyes to look at the Emperor, just as it hurts your eyes to look at the blazing sun." One recalls that when God summoned Moses to Mount Sinai the elders were not allowed to come near, nor might the people go up with him; and we are told that "the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel." When Moses descended from the moun- tain his face shone so brightly that Aaron and his people were afraid to approach near him, and hence he had to put on a veil while speaking to them.'0 Angels, too, might terrify by their visages, as did the one who guarded the tomb of Christ: "His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men."" In a medieval story a certain Moamethus, a sufferer from epi- lepsy, not wishing his newly acquired wife to learn why he had fallen down, explains that he had seen the angel Gabriel and had been unable to endure the sight of him.12 Brightness and flames were often recognized as signs of divinity"' and sometimes it was thought prudent not to look at a light that was recognized as divine. For this reason the goatherd Aresthanas turned aside as he saw a light flashing from the infant Aesculapius, who lay in his path."4 Even the radiance of a statue might blind those who saw it. While Achaeans were plundering Pellene and fighting one another, 9 Xenophon, Memorabilia Iv, 3, 13 f. Pliny says (Nat. Hist. vii, 22) that the Gym- nosophists of India were able to look steadfastly at the sun from its rising till its setting. 1o Exodus xxIv, 2; xx, 18-21; and xxiv, 17, and 29-35. 11 Matthew xxvIII, 3 f. 12 Michael Glycas, Annales, Part Iv, p. 514 of the edition in Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae. 13 Cf., for example, Theocritus xxIv, 22, 38 f.

In this city there was a statue which usually stood untouched. When the priestess carried it forth from the temple people averted their gaze, for the effects of seeing it were grievous. Trees past which it was borne became barren. In this emergency the guardian priestess brought out the image and turned it in the faces of the Achaeans, whom it deprived of their reason.15 The quotations from Life show how easily a blinding radiance may be ascribed to exalted personages. A further illustration may be found in a story which is not less instructive because it is amusing: After the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588, a naval tournament was arranged for the victorious British seamen and, at the request of Admiral Drake, Queen Elizabeth consented to come down from London and award the prizes. The officer in charge of the arrangements proved himself one of the most tactful men in history-he issued orders that "on account of the dazzling loveliness of Her Majesty, all seamen, upon receiving their prizes, should shield their eyes with their right hand." Thus was born the naval and military salute.'" There may be a fairly close analogy even for the most striking part of this incident. A Creto-Mycenaean seal shows a goddess appearing to an adorant, who, as if blinded, raises his hand to his head." The compliment paid to Queen Elizabeth is surpassed, perhaps, by the spontaneous tribute of Duke Ferdinand to blinding beauty in John Webster's Duchess of Malfi, Act IV, Scene ii: "Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle; she died young." In their love of grandeur and power anthropomorphic gods are not less terrestrial than their creators. When man endows them with unlimited mightiness and magnificence he is merely con- ferring upon them attributes which human beings possess or would like to possess. EUGENE S.
