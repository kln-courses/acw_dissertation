<plain_text><page sequence="1">BLAKE AND THE DRUIDS Peter F. Fisher\, Royal Military College of Canada The context of Blake's treatment of Druidism was primarily his own particular vision of human history, but much of what he had to say was understandably connected with traditional sources and the theories of contemporary antiquarians. The theories of antiquarians such as Bryant, Davies, and Stukeley have received more attention, since they happen to be in the main stream of scholarly research, and the traditional sources a good deal less. Of these traditional sources, references in classical authors have been noticed, but practically nothing has been said about that large body of folklore containing the remains of Welsh bardism. No one could deny that this material was a mixture of ancient tradition and later additions, but this very fact would have attracted Blake, and may have moved him to add another 'moment' to the life of the bardic tradition with his "Welch Triades" at the beginning of his Descriptive Catalogue of 1809.1 To establish the relationship between the traditional sources of Druidism and Blake's own use of the term in Milton and Jerusalem will involve considerable reference to some of the theories of the antiquarians, relevant state ments in classical authors, and especially his conception of natural religion. For him history was the field of recurrent attempts to wake up human conscience, both individual and social. Each attempt was a new vision finally reduced by the dead weight of self-interest and misunderstanding to some system of accepted beliefs with its conven tional morality and its sacrificial rites. Bardic tradition provided him with an apt symbol of what history was about and also with a con venient foil for his gospel of vision. Blake did not actually mention the immediate source of this in terest in bardism, but some of the triads had been collected and trans lated by Edward Williams and were to be found as an appendix to a collection of his poems published in 1794. Williams called himself a "Bard according to the Rights and Institutes of the Bards of the Island of Britain," and claimed that his triads were translated from the 1 H. N. Frye (Fearful Symmetry [Princeton, 1947], p. 173) refers to Blake's 'triads' as imitations or adaptations in the fashion of the day. They certainly are not to be found in Williams' collection at the back of his Poems, Lyrical and Pastoral (London, 1794, Vol. 11). 589</page><page sequence="2">5 ?o Fisher Silurian or most ancient dialect.2 The ?triad' itself was said to be the most common of all aphoristical forms used by the bards, since it was constructed on the basis of certain fixed and unalterable principles where the connections of its parts were related to one another simply and concisely. The form was evidently used for oral instruction in that lore which the Druids refused to commit to writing.3 These particular triads were selected from a manuscript collection by Llewelyn Sion, a Bard of Glamorgan, about 1560. Of this particular manuscript, Williams claimed to have a transcript, and the original collection was said to have been made from various manuscripts of great antiquity. To such a collection as that of Williams, Blake probably re ferred in his Descriptive Catalogue when he wrote of having "in his hands poems of the highest antiquity."4 Blake's attitude toward Druidism was likely influenced and, in many ways, perhaps formed by such fragments and the commentaries on them. He first saw Druidism as the "Patriarchal Religion" which, in its completed cycle, exemplified every aspect of an inspired, pro phetic faith, and later, of a degenerate cult. Part of this outlook was taken from the antiquarians who, like Bryant and Davies, emphasized the civilization and learning of the Ancient Britons and also an orig inal unity of language, culture, and religion.5 There was understandably a great deal of accommodation to Christian belief in these traditions. The traditional chronology (amseryddiaeth) gave some support to antiquarian theory which was already trying to expand the scope of Genesis without actually con tradicting it. Druidic chronology was divided into three main dispen sations: from creation to the sixth century B.C. was the first; from the sixth century to the third century A.D., the second; and the third was the Christian. These contributions of Celtic enthusiasts and of the antiquarians confirmed Blake's conviction that all antiquities could be traced to one source?a prophetic and inspired faith. 2 Williams, i, xx : "The Silurian differs in many particulars from the Biblical dialect of modern writers. To attempt an investigation of the true sense of the very obscure term Abred would have required a longer dissertation than I had room for; and prob ably, my abilities would have failed me." 3 Ibid., n, 225. Cf. Caesar, De Bello Gallico, vi, xiii. Caesar also noted that the institution (disciplina) was said to have originated in Britain. See Jerusalem, II, 27, Pref., where Blake calls Albion the "Parent of the Druids." 4 Blake, No. V: The Ancient Britons. 6 Ibid.: "The Britons (say historians) were naked civilized men, learned, studious, abstruse in thought and contemplation; naked, simple, plain in their acts and manners; wiser than after-ages."</page><page sequence="3">Blake and the Druids 591 The antiquities of every Nation under Heaven, is no less sacred than that of the Jews. They are the same thing, as Jacob Bryant and all antiquaries have proved .... All had originally one language, and one religion: this was the religion of Jesus, the everlasting Gospel. Antiquity preaches the Gospel of Jesus.6 The kind of "Antiquity" to which Blake referred was a universal, "Druidic" antiquity where his own conception of genius and inspira tion at first flourished and then suffered a decline. Blake's identification of the original, universal culture with Druid ism was supported by both Davies and Stukeley, but the traditional sources for it went back to bardic legends and classical authors. Davies cited Diogenes Laertius' opinion that the "philosophy of Greece originated in the Celtae."7 Abaris, a priest of Apollo among the Druidic Hyperboreans, was said to have visited Pythagoras for the ostensible purpose of taking back to one of the northern temples the gold which he had collected. An actual exchange of doctrine was im plied, and the most durable of the Greek philosophic schools whose founder had learned from Egyptian priests, Persian Magi, the Brahmans of India, and the initiates of Samothrace was also directly connected with British Druidism. The Pythagoreans emphasized this latter connection more than any of the others, for they said that Pythagoras himself was the incarnation of the Hyperborean Apollo, and inferred that the most Greek of Greek gods had originated in Britain. No wonder Blake called Greek philosophy "a remnant of Druidism."8 Diodorus Siculus, out of Hecataeus and other sources, 8 Ibid.: "The British Antiquities are not in the Artist's hands; all his visionary contemplations, relating to his own country and its ancient glory, when it was, as it again shall be, the source of learning and inspiration." Milton (Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce, in Works [New York, 1932], in, 376) mentioned the Druids as those "by whom this Island was the Cathedrall of Philosophy to France." 7 Edward Davies, Celtic Researches (London, 1804), p. 184. Cf. Mythology and Rites of the British Druids (London, 1809), sec. II, p. 123 : "The mythology of the Britons was of a character somewhat more antique than that of the Greeks and Romans, as we find it in their best writers.'' Diogenes Laertius traced the beginnings of philosophy to related sources which included the Persian Magi, the Chaldeans, the Indian gym nosophists, and the Druids (De Clarorum Philosophorum Vitis, proemium). See also Pliny, Historia Naturalis, XVI, 95; XXIV, 62-63; XXIX, 12. Cf. Milton, Areopagitica, Works (Columbia ed.), rv, 339: "Writers of good antiquity, and ablest judgement have bin perswaded that ev'n the school of Pythagoras, and the Persian wisdom took beginning from the old Philosophy of this Island." 8 Jerusalem, III, 52, Pref. The story of Abaris is first recorded by Herodotus (Historiae, IV, 36) ; other references are Porphyry's life of Pythagoras and Iamblichus {De Pythagorica Vita, xix, xxviii). Abaris was said to have travelled over the whole world, without food, carrying an arrow which he later showed Pythagoras. By means</page><page sequence="4">592 Fisher said that the Britons worshipped Apollo above all other gods, and that they had a special regard for the Greeks?particularly the Athenians and the Delians. Abaris was supposed to have renewed the ancient league of friendship with the Delians. It is not surprising that these classical references to British Druidism were exploited to the full by the antiquarians who laboured with enthusiasm at the task of demonstrating Blake's own thesis: "All things Begin &amp; End in Albion's Ancient Druid Rocky Shore."9 That part of their work which included classical culture was but tressed by the evidence of ancient writers, but the link with Hebraic tradition required more ingenuity. Stukeley did not hesitate to claim that the Druids came to Britain as a Phoenician colony as soon as Tyre was founded, during the life of Abraham. They brought with them the customs and beliefs of the patriarchal religion and even the technical details of sacred architecture. I must prepare the reader for a right understanding of our Druid edifices, by informing him, that Stonehenge, and all other works of this nature in our island, are erected by the most ancient measure call'd a cubit, which we read of in the holy scripture and in ancient profane authors. I mean the same indi vidual measure, call'd the Hebrew, Egyptian, Phoenician cubit; most prob ably deriv'd from Noah and Adam. 'Tis the same that the pyramids of Egypt and other of their works are projected upon; the same as that of Moses's tabernacle, Solomon's temple, &amp;c, and we may reasonably pride ourselves in possessing these visible monuments of the old measure of the world.10 Davies went still further and quoted an ingenious friend of his who sug gested that Menyw, the first man of the Druidic tradition, was iden tical with Menu (Manu) of the Indian Veda. He even extended the of this arrow, he claimed to have passed through inaccessible places and expelled pes tilence from cities on the way. He lived in temples and was never seen to eat or drink. Davies {Celtic Researches, p. 183) connected the arrow with the wheat straw used by the Druids in the rites of Apollo and Diana, and also suggested that 'arrow' {otaros) was a play on the word 'think' (Ep. oteo), so that what Abaris really conveyed was his doctrine. Stukeley {Abury [London, 1743], pp. 96-97) even supposed the arrow to be some kind of instrument like a magnetic needle. See Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Hist?rica, II, 47. Finally, the encircling of the globe by Abaris could refer to the mysti cal journey of the soul around the Circle of Incho?tion (abred) before attaining the Circle of Felicity. 9 Jerusalem, II, 27, Pref. Milton, I, 6, 25. The fact that Blake associated the "Religion of Jesus" with an original Druidism should surprise no one who has noticed Stukeley's title of 'patriarchal Christianity' for the larger theme of his work {Abury, pp. i-ii). 10 William Stukeley, Stonehenge (London, 1740), p. 6.

Both Menu and Minos, however, were finally made to refer to the patriarch Noah.11 Blake made use of all this in much the same spirit as Dante made use of Thomistic philosophy and the astronomy of Ptolemy. If he had been a Greek, he would have found the navel of the world at Delphi. For one wTho was never tired of emphasizing that the journey to Eden started from the ground under one's feet, and that the most visionary perspective included the geography of one's own country, antiquarian theory provided accommodating material. It was clear that Bryant and Davies concentrated on the more favourable aspects of Druidic culture?aspects which Blake used to establish his account of the fall of man and the impact of prophetic inspiration on the subsequent history of man's fallen societies. An indication of the rela tionship Druidism bore to the elaboration of this original pattern was to be found in A Descriptive Catalogue (particularly Nos. IV and V) where Gray's bard, the last of the Druids, was placed beside a de scription of the last "Battle of King Arthur" (Albion) and the rout of his forces (disorganization of Albion's faculties, the "Zoas"). Here Blake was associating inspiration and the divine vision with Druidism. However, he later came to treat Druidism pejoratively?in the last two books of Jerusalem?as the degenerate effect of man's fallen historical destiny on original prophetic inspiration.12 Druidism be came the symbol of the outer husk of an earlier vision, and such a translation of the triads as that of Williams must have provided him with material for evaluating both husk and vision. Williams himself was the zealous prophet of what he considered an expression of the true faith. He ridiculed Gray's Bard as an example of the literary confusion of a "savage Scandinavian Mythology" with 11 Davies also claimed that Arthur was one of the titles of Noah to whose deification he attributed the development of pagan myth (Mythology and Rites of the British Druids, sec. Ill, p. 187). Blake's association of Arthur with Albion could be traced to Davies, along with Atlas, who is called a Hyperborean (cf. Hesiod, Theogony, 736). For the connection between Menu, Minos, and Druidism, see sec. Ill, p. 197. See also Caesar, De Bello Gallico, VI, xviii. 12 Cf. Frye, p. 175; Joseph Wicksteed, William Blake1 s "Jerusalem" (London, I953)&gt; P- 57- This same ambivalent outlook (which is far from being equivocation) may be seen in his remarks on the antiquities of the Jews. On the one hand, he called the laws of the Jews "the basest &amp; most oppressive of human codes" (Annotations to Watson*s "Apology for the Bible," p. 25), and on the other, spoke of the "Return of Israel" as a "Return to Mental Sacrifice &amp; War" (Jerusalem, II, 27)?a return to the original prophetic religion of inner struggle and search.</page><page sequence="6">594 Fisher British antiquities. The charge was obviously that of an enthusiastic purist who could see nothing but good in the Druidic tradition. It was perhaps because of this that he resented the appropriation of ancient British lore by the "Gothic" revival. However, the tradition had itself undergone various changes which made it difficult to decide how much of an authentic original was to be found in the synopsis of Llewelyn Sion in the first place. The selections which Williams chose gave no evidence of the interest noticed by classical writers in the theology of a pantheon of gods. Caesar, for instance, described the Druids as in terested in disputes concerning the power of the gods, and added that they paid particular honours to Mercury whom they considered the inventor of all arts. After Mercury, he went on to say, they wor shipped Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, and Minerva like other nations. Strabo, the geographer, cited the authority of Artemidorus that in "an island close to Britain," presumably Ireland, Ceres and Proser pine were venerated with rites similar to those of Samothrace.13 By calling himself, on his title page, "Bard according to the Rights and Institutes of the Bards of the Island of Britain," Williams might be said to lose the objectivity of the editor, and become an apologist for the triads he was translating. Along with the polemic of the apologist and the voice of the pro phetic bard, he also mixed the ardor of the republican revolutionary? a combination which would not prove unappealing to Blake. He spoke of his intention of going to America to escape the injustice of laws which were not "made equally for the poor as for the rich." Another motive is to ascertain the truth of an opinion, prevalent in Wales, on good authority, that there are still existing, in the interior parts of the American Continent, the remains of a Welsh Colony that went over there in the twelfth Century under the conduct of Madoc, the son of Owen Gwynedd, Prince of Wales.14 13 Strabo, Geographica, IV, 4; Caesar, De Bello Gallico, VI, xiv-xvii. These refer ences were also cited by Davies (sec. II, pp. 88-89). Williams (11, 202) admitted that his outline was what had been refined by Christianity "in which the Bards adopted nothing that was averse to their Ancient Theology, but rather confirmed the truth of it." Milton (Mansus, 11. 42-43) described the Druids as a race "busied with the holy rites of the gods (sacris operata deorum).'7 14 Williams, 1, xii; 11, 64 n. The material for Sou they's Madoc was taken from William Robertson's History of America published in 1777. Sou they's story of a Celtic adventurer who founded a settlement in mythical 'Aztlan'?the ancestral home of the Aztecs?and was finally made to fight for his life at the foot of the stone of sacrifice suggested the common origin of both Aztec and Druidic sacrificial rites. Blake spoke equally of the "reared Rocks of Albion's Sons" (Jerusalem, II, 43, 82) and the "Rocks of the Altars of Victims in Mexico" (ibid., 7).</page><page sequence="7">Blake and the Druids 595 Southey's poem came as a later illustration of the legendary unity between Britain and America which formed part of the source for Blake's development of Albion as "Patriarch of the Atlantic." There was also his conception of a prehistoric "Atlantic continent"?the basis of both cultures?and he made use of the Atlantic ocean to represent the flood which destroyed an original civilization of the world. To Blake, however, the 'flood' was ultimately synonymous with the 'fall.' The real origin of cultivated life lay in his "Atlantic Mountains where Giants dwelt in Intellect"?the paradise state of Eden far beyond the "stony Druids" and the "Creation that groans, living on Death."15 But while he made use of the materials of Celtic myth to communicate his own vision, Williams tried to accommodate the triads of Bardism to Christian doctrine. Aside from ignoring any reference to those parts of the tradition which might be interpreted as polytheistic, Williams was faced with a conception of reincarnation which, in one form or another, held a central position in the Druidic system. I have in one passage mentioned a qualified sense in which the Christian Bards and Druids believed the Metempsychosis: this was, that the depraved soul of man passes in a state beyond the grave into progressive modes of existence corresponding with the nature of Earthly worms and brutes, into whom, in the literal sense, the Aboriginal or Patriarchal Druids believed it passed. Taliesin places this probationary, divestigating, or purifying Metempsychosis in the Hell of Christianity, whence the soul gradually rises again to Felicity, the way for it having been opened by Jesus Christ.16 Blake's outlook, expressed explicitly at the end of Jerusalem, that all lives, through the process of time, came to the realization of a full "Humanity" was in striking contrast to the Druidic conception of a 16 Jerusalem, II, 50, 1-7. See this fragment to the Countess of Egremont: My designs unchang'd remain. Time may rage but rage in vain. For above Time's troubled Fountains On the Great Atlantic Mountains, In my Golden House on high, There they Shine Eternally. Cf. Jerusalem, II, 36, 38-39. G. M. Harper ("Blake's Neo-Platonic Interpretation of Plato's Atlantis Myth," JEGP, liv [January, 1955], 72-79) traces this and other references to Thomas Taylor's commentaries on Plato. 16 Williams, 1, xx-xxi. He later claimed that the doctrine of metempsychosis most clearly vindicated divine justice (11, 194 n.). "It is sufficiently countenanced by many passages in the New Testament, and was believed by many of the Primitive Christians, and by the Essenes amongst the Jews." Cf. Job 33: 29-30; Malachi 4: 5; Matthew 11: 13-14; 17: 10-13; Mark 9: n-13; John 9: 2-3.</page><page sequence="8">596 Fisher ladder of ascent from the subhuman to the superhuman. This very ladder seemed to infer that man had been something else, and was about to become something else, and it tended to make man turn aside from the realization of his human existence. He was to find the source and order of life elsewdiere?either beneath, in the forces of nature, or beyond, in the ideal of divine perfection. Both routes dis tracted him from himself and the field of his actual experience. Blake saw in Druidism the prototype of all systematic theology which at tempted to explain the paradoxes of spiritual life in the rational terms of fallen man and his world of nature. Druidism, according to Blake, gradually degenerated into man's first attempt to let theory take the place of reality, and theorizing, the place of realizing, so that the fallen condition became more comfort able and apparently more secure. He called the Indian systems of thought "Abstract Philosophy," and the systems of Pythagoras and Plato, "Abstract Law," to express the progressive reduction of in spired insight to some absolutely logical scheme.17 The traditional theory of reincarnation, like the orthodox Christian doctrine of elec tion and reprobation, provided an absolute rule of thumb for what was relative in actual human experience. Both were attempts to re duce insight beyond the fallen perspective to dogmatic form, and both left out the other side of the paradox which even ordinary experience suggested. What is given in experience is always unique, and at the same time, always a repetition of everything like it, but this does not necessarily mean that everything is predetermined once and for all or that everything is bound to repeat itself. The circle of recurrence was identity in motion, in process, so that the temporal cycle was, as Blake came to see it, the 'analogy' of eternal identity. One of his definitions of character was what could be repeated with infinite variety but could neither be surpassed nor changed into something else, for we see the same characters repeated again and again, in animals, vege tables, minerals, and in men; nothing new occurs in identical existence; Accident ever varies, Substance can never suffer change nor decay.18 17 The Song of Los, 11. 18-19. 18 A Descriptive Catalogue &amp;c, No. III. Needless to say, Blake nowhere gave any support to the change of human into animal existences implied by the literal interpre tation of the Pythagorean tradition. Williams (11, 197) reflected the Druidic belief in subhuman and superhuman progressions, and spoke of a falling away from good and a return to it through "a succession of animal existences." Thomas Taylor in his trans lation of Proclus' Theology of Plato (London, 1816, 1, 1 n.) quoted that particular</page><page sequence="9">Blake and the Druids 597 The truth underlying the reincarnation of character and that under lying the unique individuality of each character formed part of this visionary analogy which Blake tried to establish between time and eternity throughout his prophetic books. What was perceived as periodic and successive was seen from the temporal point of view, and what was perceived as unique and simultaneous was seen from the eternal point of view. Both points of view coincide in the moment of vision when the paradox was resolved, and everything was seen to be eternal.19 The problem of presenting a unified vision of temporal periodicity had become clarified for Blake while writing what he finally called The Four Zoas. It was probably during this part of his life that he read Williams or encountered the bardic triads in some form. What ever he found in them to disagree with, they must have struck him as authentic in the same sense that he considered Macpherson and Chat terton authentic. He was not the least interested in documentary authenticity, but rather in the authentic original as it survived and was recreated continually in the human mind.20 The authentic original of Druidism which developed systematically from the central notion of cyclical recurrence was deeply involved with Blake's theme of creation, redemption, and judgment in The Four Zoas. The writing of this work made clear a distinction he later used in Milton and Jeru salem?a distinction between inspired, prophetic religion which united temporal process and eternal identity in one vision and its recurring distillate, "Natural Religion," which abstracted temporal process and the wheel of becoming into a false kind of absolute identity expressed in the form of theological dogma. In these later works, he called the first the "Everlasting Gospel," and the second, "Druidism." In The Four Zoas, he began with the conception of the cyclical pattern of natural necessity called the "Circle of Destiny"?in philosopher's commentary (V, 329D-E) on Plato's Timaeus (42B-C) with reference to human souls descending into brute animals, and concluded that the rational essence of man could by no means become the soul of a savage animal. "For a brutal nature is not a brutal body but a brutal life." See Blake's Vision of the Last Judgment, p. 79. 19 Cf. The Laoco?n Group: "All that we See is Vision, from Generated Organs gone as soon as come, Permanent in The Imagination, Consider'd as Nothing by the Nat ural Man." 20 Annotations to Wordsworth's "Poems," pp. 364-65: "I Believe both Macpherson &amp; Chatterton, that what they say is Ancient Is so." See also Annotations to Watson7s "Apology for the Bible," pp. 15-16: "As if Public Records were True! Impossible; for the facts are such as none but the actor could tell."</page><page sequence="10">598 Fisher Jerusalem, "Divine Analogy"?and the problem of temporal recur rence dominated the work.21 Like the Druids, he recognized the larger cycle which contained man's historical destiny from Adam to Luther and included what he later called the "Twenty-Seven Heavens" and their "Churches." He also recognized the lesser lunar cycle which con tained man's individual destiny from birth to rebirth and included the phases of life outlined in The Mental Traveller. Most important, how ever, was the constant interplay of life and death, joy and sorrow, pleasure and pain, the one contrary living off the other, yet never completely absorbing it. As in Swedenborg, Blake found in Druidism a deep-rooted tendency to eliminate one contrary in favour of the other and to regard this process as the moral triumph of good over evil. All modes of existence which are necessarily as numerous as Divine Concep tion can make them, will forever remain in existence with no other change than that of being thoroughly divested of all their Evils, and continue eter nally as beautiful varieties in the Creation, which without this numerosity of externalities would not possess perfect beauty.22 The moral judgment abhors a paradox, but it is only in paradox that the recurrent nature of life and its unique identity can both be under stood. To fall short of this paradox is to become committed to the half-truths of formal logic and dogmatic theology where, to get a final answer, it is necessary to eliminate the contrary aspect of every prob lem. The inability to sustain the paradox of the contraries was, in ef fect, a submission to the cloven fiction of two exhaustive alternatives to every problem?in this instance, that of recurrence and identity. Druidism which stood for a view of eternal identity in terms of tem poral succession was typical of all natural religions according to Blake. On the other hand, the everlasting gospel was the vision of the circle of time contained by eternal identity as the substantial form underly ing every possibility. Orthodox Christian doctrine had come to accept as limited a view of the problem as Druidism, and Augustine's attack on the whole cyclical theory which he attributed to the failure of 21 The Four Zoas, I, 71-102; Jerusalem, II, 49, 56-59; IV, 85, 3-13. 22 Williams, 11, 202. Blake even spoke of suffering as necessary (H. Crabb Robin son, Diary [Boston, 1869], p. 27). "There is suffering in heaven, for where there is the capacity of enjoyment, there is also the capacity of pain." The painless, effortless paradise of the faithful could only be pleasant, or even endurable, as an impossible dream. Cf. Marriage of Heaven and Hell: "Without Contraries is no progression. Attraction and Repulsion, Reason and Energy, Love and Hate, are necessary to Human existence. "</page><page sequence="11">Blake and the Druids 599 logic to grasp the nature of infinity could as easily be turned against his own doctrine of special creation and predestination.23 On the level of accepted doctrine, Christianity obviously regarded the theory of cycles as a contradiction of the historical principle inherent in Scrip ture?the progressive disclosure of the spirit of truth. It also objected to the repetition of typical or characteristic individuals and events as contrary to the unique character of personal identity and historical situations. As a professed Christian, Blake was careful to distinguish between the visionary significance of periodicity and the crass naturalism with which it was later interpreted by both the Druidic and classical traditions. But he continued to accept the notion of cyclical recurrence as one of the contraries involved in the relationship between identity and process. In Jerusalem, he clearly indicated that the "Circle of Destiny" of his Four Zoas was to be understood as an analogy which served to express the seer's visionary experience of the polarity of the unique and the periodic. He gave no indication of trying to reconcile these two contraries on the level of doctrine at all. It was probably not until Milton and Jerusalem that he finally succeeded in liberating himself from his own "Circle of Destiny," so that he saw it as "Divine Analogy." Within the context of The Four Zoas, however, Blake described the attempt of man's natural reason to encompass the fallen world of space and time in terms of cyclical repetition. Urizen was the "Mental Traveller" who united the larger cycle of human history to the in dividual cycle of human life?one whose contrary was no longer a female counterpart but the earth's "bosom of clay" created in the void. When wearied, dead he fell, his limbs repos'd in the bosom of slime ; As the seed falls from the sower's hand, so Urizen fell, &amp; death Shut up his powers in oblivion; then as the seed shoots forth In pain &amp; sorrow, so the slimy bed his limbs renew'd. At first an infant weakness; periods pass'd; he gather'd strength, But still in solitude he sat; then rising, threw his flight Onward, tho' falling, thro' the waste of night &amp; ending in death And in another resurrection to sorrow &amp; weary travel.24 23 Augustine, De Civitate Dei, xii, 18-22; v, 9-10. The rejection of the theory of cycles (circuitus temporum) was an early characteristic of Christian thought (see Origen, Contra Celsum, iv, 68). 24 The Four Zoas, VI, 159-66. Urizen's fall, it will be noted, took the form of a spiral whirling in "unresistible revolutions" (1. 154).</page><page sequence="12">6oo Fisher In addition, Urizen was represented bearing with him his books which remained unconsumed after each periodic death and resurrection. The continuity of experience and a final "perfect recollection" was also emphasized by traditional Bardism. Man, on arriving at a state above Humanity, recovers the perfect recollection of all former modes of existence, and to eternity retains it.26 Blake never supposed that man could surpass his human identity, although he could realize it to an extent which included an eternal progression. There were references, however, to what Shelley might have called pre-existence and to "former modes of existence." In a letter to Flaxman, sent from Felpham on 21 September 1800, he wrote: I look back into the regions of Reminiscence &amp; behold our ancient days before this Earth appear'd in its vegetated mortality to my mortal vegetated Eyes. I see our houses of Eternity which can never be separated, tho' our Mortal vehicles should stand at the remotest corners of heaven from each other. Crabb Robinson mentioned a sense in which Blake claimed to have been, or to have been with, Socrates.26 All these references tend to show that the Druids took their anal ogy from the cyclical order of nature and applied it to human destiny as a part of that order. Blake took his analogy from his own vision of human existence and applied it to the circle of time or what he meant by mature.' In other words, mature' to the Druid and the Deist was the basic reality containing a scale of being including man, but to Blake, 'nature' was the lowest degree in a scale of visionary per ception which man himself contained. He came to see in Druidism the original of contemporary Deism with its remote, unapproachable Deity whose laws were to be found in the natural order. After the complimentary remarks of his Descriptive Catalogue, he made use of "Druidism" as the most perverse form the "Religion of Generation" could take to destroy human conscience in the person of Jerusalem.27 In spite of Williams' denial of any connection between Druidism and natural religion and the antiquarians' praise of it as the religion of the patriarchs, Blake saw in its isolation of the Deity and its exaltation of him into the Supreme Moral Agent the root of the worst of all 25 Williams, il, 198. 26 Quoted by Alexander Gilchrist, Life of William Blake (Everyman ed., London, 1942), p. 333. 27 Jerusalem, I, 7, 63-64. Williams (11, 199) consistently referred Druidic doctrine to divine revelation. "Bardism always refers its origin to Divine communications, and never talked of, I know not what, Religion of Nature."</page><page sequence="13">Blake and the Druids 601 tyrannies?one based on the apparently reasonable and benevolent demands of the natural man's ideals. So interpreted, nature and nat ural laws became the "Stone of Trial" and the "Stone of Torture" to balance the scale of moral justice between good and evil for the human victim in this best of all possible worlds. The victimization of man, in Blake's opinion, followed the im memorial pattern of the deterioration of religious discipline from internal effort to external pressure, and finally, to the kind of adjust ment to social order and natural necessity required by the Deist. Such a deterioration was the inevitable result of virtue ceasing to mean "a man's leading propensity" and becoming a synonym for an acceptable pattern of behaviour. Correction of behaviour according to some pattern or code tended to become increasingly negative, and eventually culminated in the ritual murder of criminals in the name of moral virtue. Blake considered the whole process negative and therefore vicious, however necessary the expedient and however good the intention. Morality was a concession to the ways of this world and the natural man's substitute for conscience. While we are in the world of Mortality we Must Suffer. The Whole Creation Groans to be deliver'd; there will always be as many Hypocrites born as Honest Men, &amp; they will always have superior Power in Mortal Things. You cannot have Liberty in this World without what you call Moral Virtue, &amp; you cannot have Moral Virtue without the Slavery of that half of the Human Race who hate what you call Moral Virtue.28 Those who hated what was called moral virtue were those whose morality took the inner form of conscience. Conscience in those that have it is unequivocal. It is the voice of God. Our judgment of right &amp; wrong is Reason.29 As the abiding ethical principle, forgiveness of sins represented to Blake the eternal process of regeneration as against the purely tem poral process of moral justification with its calculated balancing of ethical debits and credits. Forgiveness of sins was the characteristic 28 Vision of the Last Judgment, pp. 92-95. "In Hell all is Self Righteousness; there is no such thing there as Forgiveness of Sin; he who does Forgive Sin is Crucified as an Abettor of Criminals, &amp; he who performs Works of Mercy in Any shape whatever is punish'd &amp;, if possible, destroy'd, not thro' envy or Hatred or Malice, but thro* Self Righteousness that thinks it does God Service, which God is Satan." 29 Annotations to Watson9 s ilApology for the Bible,fi p. 2. Blake's marginalia to this particular book reflect his attitude to the pretensions of any rationale of morality. Cf. p. 117: "The Gospel is Forgiveness of Sins &amp; has No Moral Precepts; these belong to Plato &amp; Seneca &amp; Nero."

What finally reunited regenerate man (Albion) to his eternal sense of values (Jerusalem) or his conscience was the recognition of the dis tinction between the religion of generation represented as "Druidic" and the religion of regeneration called the "Everlasting Gospel." It took Albion from the beginning to the end of Jerusalem to see the dif ference between them, and in the process, explore the depths of Ulro? "meer Nature or Hell." The three states of Ulro were called "Crea tion, Redemption &amp; Judgment,"30 and they formed the infernal counterparts of those which led on to eternal life: Generation, Beulah, and Eden. The difference between the kind of universal outlook im plied by the infernal states and that implied by the others was the difference between an outlook dedicated to outer conformity and one disciplined to inner fulfillment. The three states of Ulro were three stages in the individual's relationship to the ruler of this world con ceived as the supreme moral agent and judge?a cosmic version of Orwell's Big Brother. The other three states, however, were stages in the individual's progressive realization of his "Human Existence." Generation was the state into which he was born and in which he dare not remain or he would consolidate in it and fall into Ulro. It was the state of nature as seen by the visionary imagination, just as Ulro was nature without vision. It was, in fact, human life seen as a living process within the circle of time?with its problems, contradictions, and constant change. Beulah was the state in which these problems and contradictions disappeared?"where Contrarieties are equally True."31 It was the state where the individual had put to rest the natural "Selfhood" without having fully realized his "Human Exist ence"?a state significantly associated with the Quietists such as F?nelon and Teresa, rather than the prophets. Finally, there was Eden, the "land of life," where the "Human Existence" was fully realized, and time could be seen from the standpoint of eternity. How, then, did Blake's "states" compare with the "circles" of 30 Jerusalem, II, 36, 41-42. Reuben is called (11. 23-24) the "Vegetative Man," and Merlin is "his Immortal Imagination." "Ulro," probably an anagram of 'rule' or 'ruler,' is the natural state of "Single vision" (Letter to Thomas Butts, 22 November 1802) associated with Newton and mere spatial extension. See also Annotations to Sweden borgs "Divine Love and Wisdom," pp. 195-96. 31 Milton, II, 30, 1. For references to the states of existence, see D. J. Sloss and J. P. R. Wallis, The Prophetic Writings of William Blake (Oxford, 1926), ii, 134-37; 151-52; 162-63; 234-35.</page><page sequence="15">Blake and the Druids 603 Druidism found in Williams? For, according to the tradition of the Welsh Druids, there were three "Circles of existence." There are three Circles (or states) of existence: the Circle of Infinity, where there is nothing but God, of living or dead, and none but God can traverse; the Circle of Incho?tion, where all things are by Nature derived from Death; this circle has been traversed by man; and the Circle of Felicity, where all things spring from Life; this man shall traverse in Heaven.32 At first glance, the three circles of Druidism would seem to correspond to Blake's states: Generation, Beulah, and Eden, but the most not able features of his outlook wTere missing. First of all, there was no evident conviction that all existence must be seen as human to some degree, since man could not hope to understand anything from a viewpoint other than his own. Secondly, struggle and search, the mental warfare of eternity, was understood as an unfavourable as pect of the lowest circle of existence?as belonging to death rather than life.33 Finally, Blake's notion that man contained both creator and creature in himself, along with heaven and hell, was apparently avoided in favour of a disciplined resignation to an absolute code of imposed conditions. Blake obviously thought that Druidism had come to sacrifice life to its conditions. Every 'religion' was prone to take this degenerate form?a form which was usually expressed as a code of rules or laws. He therefore emphasized that the source of the good life lay in in dividual struggle and search rather than in conformity to an estab lished set of regulations. But the God of the Welsh Triads would seem to be a Supreme Regulator like Plato's Divine Geometer and Priest ley's Watchmaker?one for whom the correct conditions of life were more important than life itself. The three regulations of God towards giving existence to every thing: to 32 Williams, n, 241. "Infinity," Williams points out, is a translation of Ceugant which "in its etymological sense, signifies the Circle of Vacuity; in its metaphysical ac ceptation, here, it signifies the immense void beyond the bounds of the material Crea tion, into which none but the Deity can penetrate." Another translation would be "closing circumference," reminding one of Urizen's compasses. "Incho?tion" is a trans lation of abred (ab, 'from,' and rhed, a 'course') which presumably referred to the transmigration of the soul. Gwynfyd (or Gwynvyd) meant the 'white' world, and was usually translated the "Circle of Felicity." 83 The static nature of the Circle of Infinity was in marked contrast to Blake's "Mental War" in eternity (Jerusalem, II, 43, 31-32). And the two Sources of Life in Eternity, Hunting and War, Are become the Sources of dark &amp; bitter Death &amp; of corroding Hell.</page><page sequence="16">6o4 Fisher annihilate the power of evil, to assist all that is good, and to make discrimina tion manifest, that it might be known what should and what should not be.34 The deification of conditions which included natural, social, and moral laws amounted to a deification of the nature of things seen by man's limited perceptions in his present degree of development. This meant that man fell from Generation into Ulro?the net of conditions which, when accepted as final, Blake called "Nature," "Natural Morality," and "Natural Religion." In opposition to the deification of life's con ditions, he chose to deify human life itself, or rather, human existence, since he did not worship what man usually was, but what it was in him to be. "For everything that lives is Holy." He found it necessary to restore the priority of life over its functions, conditions, and es pecially its ideals. In the prophetic books, man's fallen state was at tributed to the fact that his "Human Existence" was asleep, and his faculties and the conditions of his life had usurped control over him. To emphasize law at the expense of life would keep Albion asleep forever. For Blake conscience was the actual criterion of moral rectitude, the living law as distinct from the law of the members which was the rule of temporal conditions. He did not suppose it possible to get rid of the outer law of nature and society, but he did object to giving this kind of legal sanction a dignity beyond immediate necessity. The very worst that could happen was to give such legal sanctions and conventions an absolute moral authority by basing them on a divine decree. By this means morality acquired a prerogative beyond con science and tended to supersede and finally destroy it. As Blake put it, Jerusalem who was Albion's conscience was then "Offer'd up to Holiness" in the interests of "Natural Religion."35 Druidism became the original example of the destruction of conscience in the name of morality and religion. The Druidic rite of human sacrifice was the 34 Williams, il, 240. 36 Milton, I, 19, 46-48: Come, bring with thee Jerusalem with songs on the Grecian Lyre! In Natural Religion, in experiments on Men Let her be Offer'd up to Holiness! See also Annotations to Watson's "Apology for the Bible," p. 3: "If Conscience is not a Criterion of Moral Rectitude, What is it?" Blake's conception of conscience or honesty was also involved with his attack on Locke's denial of innate ideas and the whole notion of a merely natural and experimental scheme of knowledge. Cf. Annotations to Reyn olds's "Discourses," p. 58: "The Man who says that we have No Innate Ideas must be a Fool &amp; Knave, Having No Con-Science or Innate Science."</page><page sequence="17">Blake and the Druids 605 central symptom of a disintegrating society where all sacrifice was regulated from without and the sacrificial victim was the scapegoat for society's ills. The sacrifice of the victim was a parody of self sacrifice, just as the self-righteous virtue of the moralist was a parody of conscience. Blake thought of the "Patriarchal Religion" as one of self-sacrifice which later declined From willing sacrifice to Self, to sacrifice of (miscall'd) Enemies For Atone ment.36 Sacrifice which was not self-sacrifice was both useless and criminal. Bardic tradition, as Williams reported it, made every effort to justify the sacrificial rites of the Druids. The sacrifice of animals was considered a means of advancing them along the path of development. The sacrifice of animals, which were always those of the least ferocity of disposition, was a religious co-operation with Divine Benevolence, by raising such an animal up to the state of Humanity, and consequently expediting his progress towards Felicity; it was not to appease, we know not what, Divine wrath, a thing that cannot possibly exist; the idea of which is of all others, the most blasphemously disgraceful to the Deity.37 The sacrifice of human life, on the other hand, was regarded as a cooperative effort between the sacrificers and the victim, based on a doctrine of moral compensation. Man, having been guilty of crimes that are punishable by Death, must be so punished; and by giving himself up a voluntary victim to Death, being con scious of deserving it, does all that lies in his power to compensate for his crimes. . . .38 The notion of compensation and of a rule distinct from individual conscience tended to separate self-sacrifice from the moral judgment and allow the moralist to concentrate on the sacrifice of others. Blake noticed this tendency, and Druidism became the symbol of life as trial and experiment where the object of experiment was always another. He saw that the whole doctrine of moral compensation was too easily twisted by self-deceit into an excuse for vengeance in the name of the social order and into a cloak for personal jealousy. Blake's symbol of "Druid Law" was used to uncover the negative 36 Jerusalem, II, 28, 20-21. Compare Blake's reference to "Justice" and "Truth" in line 23 with Williams' sixteenth aphorism (11, 199). 87 Williams, n, 199. 38 Ibid., p. 199. A later authority (J. Williams ab Ithel, Barddas [London, 1862I, 1, lxix) referred to the doctrine of eneidvaddeu which placed the soul in a better state when, by the act of conscious atonement, it had compensated for its crimes.</page><page sequence="18">6o6 Fisher effects of the scales of moral justice in the hands of Rahab, the goddess of Nature. In her was brought together the perverse poison of mutual accusation and judgment in the infested spectre of fallen man's inner life. The Jealousies became Murderous, uniting together in Rahab A Religion of Chastity, forming a Commerce to sell Loves, With Moral Law an Equal Balance not going down with decision. Therefore the Male severe &amp; cruel, fill'd with stern Revenge, Mutual Hate returns &amp; mutual Deceit &amp; mutual Fear.39 Blake made Druidism into a comprehensive symbol of all the per versities of fallen existence which were respectably hidden in the "Religion of Generation." What made Druidism the cult of the world from which all 'worldly' religions came was its attempt to con solidate the original voice of the prophet into the fixed ritual and rule of the priest. The terms which had not been final for the seer became final in the name of an organized cult, and the conditions of life and worship were rendered invariable in the interests of an established clergy. This always produced, according to Blake, cruelty in the name of a benevolent concern for the victim's welfare, and he represented the human race in the person of Albion being sacrificed by his daugh ters in the temple of "Natural Religion." The "Divine Vision" was lost, and the human form of man's possibilities was altered, so that his perceptions were dissipated into the "Indefinite Becoming" of natural process.40 Druidism became the composite symbol of fallen man's preoccupation with a natural security at the expense of a greater human adventure. 39 Jerusalem, III, 69, 33-37. Providentially, the temporal universe, according to Blake, was so constructed that error caused the least possible suffering to the sinner (11,31,30-34): I could not dare to take vengeance, for all things are so constructed And builded by the Divine hand that the sinner shall always escape, And he who takes vengeance alone is the criminal or Providence. If I should dare to lay my finger on a grain of sand In way of vengeance, I punish the already punished. For the theme of revenge, see also III, 63, 39-41; 66, 38-39. Cf. Annotations to Watson's "Apology for the Bible," p. 25. 40 Jerusalem, III, 66, 1-56. The union, in Blake's use of imagery, between cruelty and a benevolent, even experimental, interest in the victim might be compared with Tacitus' charge (Annals, XIV, 30) that the Druids used prisoners for purposes of divination, "for they considered it lawful to offer the blood of captives on their altars, and to consult the gods by means of the nerves of men (et hominum fibris consulere deos fas habebant)." The same tendency prevailed in ecclesiastical Christianity. Cf. Notes Written on the Pages of "The Four Zoas": "Christ's Crucifix shall be made an excuse for executing Criminals."</page><page sequence="19">Blake and the Druids 607 Blake treated the decline from the "Patriarchal Religion" to "Druidism" as fundamentally a degeneration in man's powers of perception, and hence, a falling off of his imaginative genius which integrated perception and was the root of his very existence. He had become less than himself?a mere wraith or "Spectre"?and in so doing, had ceased to think of the universe as the field of intelligent agency or as a 'Cosmic Man.' Humanity had become something in between God and nature?a something which partook of both but was neither. The original myth of the Cabalistic Adam Kadmon or 'Grand Man,' who was the archetypal principle of intelligent agency in the universe, had given way to the naturalistic view of man as merely a constituent factor in the cosmic process. Blake placed the roots of the former tradition in the 'period' before Adam or in the state before the creation of the natural man. Speaking "to the Jews" in his preface to the second chapter of Jerusalem, he referred their ancestry to the patriarchs who were the first Druids. Your Ancestors derived their origin from Abraham, Heber, Shem and Noah, who were Druids, as the Druid Temples (which are the Patriarchal Pillars &amp; Oak Groves) over the whole Earth witness to this day. You have a tradition, that Man anciently contain'd in his mighty limbs all things in Heaven &amp; Earth: this you received from the Druids.41 The myth of the Giant Man was not developed in Williams' version of the triads, but instead, there was the conception of a gradual pro gression from the "lowest point of existence" to the state of felicity? a progression which stopped short of the circle of iiCeugant'J?the eternal 'Void' of the Deity. Blake objected to the disembodied Absolute or any nonhuman abstraction of Deity as the false vision of unattainable perfection, and he placed this "Central Void" in opposition to the "Divine Vision" of Christ.42 41 Jerusalem, II, 27. 42 Ibid., II, 30, 19-20. See Williams, ix, 240-41 : "All animated Beings are subject to three Necessities: a beginning in the Great Deep (lowest point of existence), Progres sion in the Circle of Incho?tion, and Plentitude in Heaven, or the Circle of Felicity; without these things nothing can possibly exist but God. Three things are necessary in the Circle of Incho?tion: the least of all animation, and thence the beginning; the materials of all things, and thence increase, which cannot take place in any other state; the Formation of all things out of the dead mass, hence discriminate individual ity." The Druidic "Circles," however, appeared as the creations of a superhuman Deity for whom progression took place, while Blake's "states" were the creations of a "Divine Humanity" in whom progression was the realization of an individual existence. Cf. Jerusalem, II, 35, 9-10: In Me all Eternity Must pass thro' condemnation and awake beyond the Grave.</page><page sequence="20">6o8 Fisher His conception of the Deity was certainly not, however, what is usually called "anthropomorphic"?the projection of fallen man's subjective idiosyncrasies. It was connected with the fact that the be ginning and end of anything can never supersede its essential origin, and the ultimate extent of man's possibilities must be the fulfillment of his "Humanity." Luvah's statement concerning the human facul ties applied to the whole question of human aspirations and ultimate aims: "Attempting to be more than Man We become less."43 The at tempt to surpass the balanced fulfillment of one's actual capabilities was characteristic of the perverse will of the natural man who wished to be superior to his neighbour and to all men. One of the main sources of unbalanced development, in Blake's opinion, lay in the primary use of the rational faculty to encompass man's present limita tions of perception and on them establish the limits of the entire universe. This was precisely what Urizen was trying to do in the sixth Night of The Four Zoas when, like the typical eighteenth-cen tury philosopher, he sought the basis of his life by examining the limitations of his faculties. At the very commencement of his journey around the worlds of man's fallen faculties, he encountered Blake's version of the three fates, the threefold representation of Vala, Goddess of Nature. They wore the three colours of the three orders of Druidic priests, and represented respectively the presiding, attract ing, and conducting powers reflected in natural process.44 In this way, 43 The Four Zoas, IX, 709. Williams (11, 197) spoke of the accommodation of the Deity to the life of man. "Finite Beings can never comprehend Infinity; they cannot conceive any thing of God, but as something external to themselves individually different, and, consequently, finite. The Deity for this reason, though in himself in finite, manifests himself to finite comprehensions as a finite being, as in the Person of Jesus Christ, &amp;c." Cf. Annotations to Swedenborg's "Divine Love and Wisdom," p. 24: "That there is but one Omnipotent, Uncreate &amp; God I agree, but that there is but one Infinite I do not; for if all but God is not Infinite, they shall come to an End, which God forbid." See also p. 11 : "Man can have no idea of any thing greater than Man, as a cup cannot contain more than its capaciousness. But God is a man, not because he is so perceiv'd by man, but because he is the creator of man." 44 The Four Zoas, VI, 8-19. This is a threefold representation of the "Daughters of Albion" who dismember him (Jerusalem, III, 66, 17-34) and reduce his vision to that of the corporeal senses. The "Eldest Woman" whose name is written on her fore head (1. 18) obviously suggests the Babylon of Revelation (17: 5). The three orders of Primitive Bards, according to Williams (11, 230-31) were Bards, Ovates (or Euvates), and Druids. The last of these was the chief, and it was the Druid (Derwydd) who dressed in white as a symbol of truth and sanctity. The Ovate (Ofydd) wore green like the vegetation of the earth, and the Bard (Prifardd), blue, the colour of heaven. See also Edward Jones, Musical and Poetical Relicks of the Welsh Bards (London, 1794; 2nd ed.), pp. 2-9. Strabo (Geographica, IV, 197) called the Bards chanters and poets, the ovates, sacrificers and physiologists, and the Druids, moral philosophers.</page><page sequence="21">Blake and the Druids 609 Druidism was connected with the initial stages of man's fall from in nocence through the birth of a rational set of moral values based on a definitive system of nature. Blake did not suppose, however, that the primitive Druids, whom he had called "wiser than after-ages," were less than the "ancient Poets" who had formed the basis of an original priesthood in his Marriage of Heaven and Hell. In fact, the Bardic Triads gave the same priority to original 'genius' as he did. By genius' he had meant the "true Man" from which his outward form was derived and to which every intellectual and physical activity could ultimately be traced. It was the 'whatness' in man, and underlay the form of any thing. Most important, the "Poetic Genius" was the universal source of forms in the species and the individual. It was the faculty which experienced, or what he called the "Imagination"?the basic root of the total imagery of experience.45 As the "Spirit of Prophecy," his conception of 'genius' could be compared with what the Druids had called awen. Although neoclassical terminology and poetic diction clearly affected Williams' translation of the "Poetic Triades" or "Triades of Song" (Trioedd Cerd?) there was much Blake could still appreciate. The three final intentions of Poetry: accumulation of Goodness; enlargement of the Understanding; and what increases Delight.46 But this original emphasis on genius was finally corrupted, according to tradition, along with the institutes of the Bards, by the Scots, Irish, Bretons, and even the Germans. Bardism survived in its pure form only among the Welsh. Williams' attitude was ultimately sectarian, although his view that Britain had been the original seat of the Patriarchal Religion was certainly shared by Blake. Neither one adopted the legend re ported by Geoffrey of Monmouth, who claimed the authority of Taliesin, the celebrated bard of the fifth century, for the story of Trojan Brutus. Blake's use of Arthur, however, probably did come from the emphasis given him by the successors of Geoffrey, but his reference to the existence of genuine Bards in the fifth century could refer to Williams' mention of Meugant, Merlin, and Taliesin who were 46 All Religions Are One. Cf. Williams, n, 232: "Without three qualifications no one can be a Bard : a poetical genius [awen wrth gerdd] ; the knowledge of Bardic insti tutes; and irreproachable morals." The orders of the original Bards (p. 231) were deter mined by genius {awen), exertion (ymgais), and incident {dichwain). 46 Williams, 11, p. 256. For the corruption of Bardism see p. 248.</page><page sequence="22">6io Fisher said to have lived around that time.47 Apart from these references, his "Druidic" period covered all but the last quarter of the "Circle of Destiny" with its historical perspective stretching over 6,000 years? beginning with Adam and ending with Luther. Original Druidism, indeed, began even before Adam and included the first two "Eyes" of God within the cycle of seven from Lucifer to Jesus.48 The "Twenty-seven Heavens &amp; their Churches" provided Blake with his cyclical calendar of history graduated according to the separate attempts to reestablish communication between time and eternity. Within this context, Druidism stretched from Adam to Terah the father of Abraham who "was called to succeed the Druidical age, which began to turn allegoric and mental signification into cor poreal command, whereby human sacrifice would have depopulated the earth."49 The "Churches" and their respective "Heavens" were ways of ordering popular belief and social practice, but the "Eyes" of God were the ways God was 'seen' or understood by each succeeding epoch. In The Four Zoas, the "Eyes" took the form of "Guards" sent to sacrifice themselves for Satan?Blake's symbol for the opacity of man's fallen perception. The Patriarchal Religion began with the first two?Lucifer and Molech?who were of the pre-Adamite age before the corporeal senses had become completely consolidated as fallen man's only avenues of perception. Between the Elohim who cre ated Adam and Pachad whose name meant 'fear' was Blake's "Dru idical age," succeeded by the worship of Jehovah by the "Church" of Abraham and the children of the promise. Druidism as a symbol in the prophetic books began to be developed in the later additions to The Four Zoas. The soi rees which Blake actually mentioned were Milton and Jacob Bryant. If the internal evidence be considered sufficient to assume that he also knew some thing of Davies and Stukeley, there is certainly as much to suggest that he had seen Williams' collection of "Welch Triades" or some such collection. The use he made of the triadic form to describe the 47 A Descriptive Catalogue b?c, No. V. Blake's reference to the "remains of those naked Heroes in the Welch Mountains" was connected with the reign of Arthur and the account of ancient British history given by Milton. Milton's evident belief in the accusations of the Romans {History of Britain, Book II, Works, Columbia ed., x, 51) made him call the Druids "Progenitors not to be glori'd in." See Williams, 11, notes to 1-3; 5-7 48 The Four Zoas, VIII, 398-406; Milton, I, 13, 17-29; Jerusalem, III, 55, 30-33.

In the last Battle that Arthur fought, the most Beautiful was one That return'd, and the most Strong another: with them also return'd The most Ugly, and no other beside return'd from the bloody Field. The most Beautiful, the Roman Warriors trembled before and worshipped: The most Strong, they melted before him and dissolved in his presence; The most Ugly they fled before with outcries and contortions of their Limbs.50 The reference, as he explained, was to the human faculties represented by the "Zoas": pathos or emotion (Luvah), sublimity or power (Tharmas), limitation or reason (Urizen), and vision or existence (Los) who was Arthur (Albion) himself. The battle was the "Intellectual Battle" mentioned at the beginning of The Four Zoas; it was the fall of the Giant Man, the Adam Kadmon of the Cabala, whose collapse from unity into diversity brought about the creation of the universe. For his Giant Man, Blake used the figure of Albion and the myth derived from the ancient Cabalistic tradition which he traced to the origins of Druidism.51 He related the stories of Arthur to such a con ception, and in the traditional death and promised return of the King, he saw the fall of man and his final redemption. Malory's own account of Arthur's epitaph suggested this same theme of death, transformation, and return. Yet some men say in many parts of England that King Arthur is not dead, but had by the will of our Lord Jesu into another place; and men say that he shall come again, and he shall win the holy cross. I will not say it shall be so, but rather I will say, here in this world he changed his life. But many men say that there is written upon his tomb this verse: Hie facet Arthur us Rex, quondam Rexque futur us.? The statement that Arthur "changed his life" in "this world" con tained Blake's notion of regeneration working in and through the entire cycle of birth and death. However, his final treatment of Arthur in Jerusalem was typical of 60 Sloss and Wallis, ii, facing 302. 61 Jerusalem, II, 27: "Albion was the Parent of the Druids, &amp; in his Chaotic State of Sleep, Satan &amp; Adam &amp; the whole World was Created by the Elohim." In his Descrip tive Catalogue, the "Triple Elohim" (cf. Milton, I, 13, 22) became the threefold life of man represented by the three Britons. The awakening of Arthur (Albion) "with tenfold splendor" probably refers to the ten sephiroth of the Cabalistic "Tree of Life" repre senting the full extent of what Blake called "Human Existence." 82 Malory, Morte d'Arthur, XXI, vii.</page><page sequence="24">6i2 Fisher his treatment of Druidism as a whole. In the scornful speech of Vala, declaring the natural man's utter dependence on the "Female Will" of Mother Nature, she described both priest and king as the false front of the fallen "Worm" in his futile attempt to establish the nat ural analogy of an eternal society. Arthur became the symbol of the dream of imperial power which would prove an enforced imitation of the real communion of eternity.53 He even became, in company with Satan and Cain, an infernal counterpart to the inspired ruler such as Moses or David and the states of existence they represented.54 It was not that Blake condemned the effort to establish an analogy of eternal existence in time, for the whole of the temporal order was a "Divine Analogy." As he had said in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, "Eter nity is in love with the productions of time." But inspiration from eternity must remain the true basis of these productions, and the temporal order of things should not be made?in the spirit of the builders of Babel and their Utopian successors?the basis and end of its own productions. "Eden" was the point where the productions of time and the life of eternity met. Blake claimed to be "an inhabitant of that happy country," and his professed aim was to unite the world of generation, through Eden, to its eternal source. 53 Jerusalem, III, 64, 12-17. The use of Arthur by Blake suggests an association with Alexander whose legendary fame probably influenced Geoffrey of Monmouth's description of Arthur. See J. S. P. Tatlock, The Legendary History of Britain (Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles, 1950), p. 312. As a precedent for Arthur, Alexander's search for im perial hegemony would reflect the search of man for the universal community of an earthly paradise enforced and maintained by the sword. Blake associated this ideal of enforced political community with the ideal of "Moral Virtue"?the basic cause of war?and with its principal protagonists: "the Alexanders &amp; Caesars, the Lewis's &amp; Fredericks" (Jerusalem, III, 52). For Blake's association of Druidism with a society cut off from eternity, see Jerusalem, III, 66, 1-15. 64 Ibid., Ill, 73, 35-42.</page></plain_text>
