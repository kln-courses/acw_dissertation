<plain_text> <page sequence="1">  The “Outsider” ♦ 77 The “Outsider”: Neil Gaiman and the  Old Testament Cyril Camus  University of Toulouse Neil Gaiman’s educational environment was divided between Jewish family and  Anglican schooling. Raised up as a cultural outsider, he has cultivated his de- tached outlook, moving from England to the United States and depicting the  latter from a British perspective in Sandman and American Gods. His cheerful  embracement of the position of the “alien” also shows in his use and rewritings  of the foundational Judaic text, the Old Testament, in the six scripts he contrib- uted for the British comics-anthology of theological satire Outrageous Tales from  the Old Testament (Knockabout, 1987), and in his comics-series Sandman (DC,  1988–1996), where the explicit linking of DC characters to their biblical roots,  and the use of Midrashic references, operate as a resacralization that counterbal- ance the desacralization at the core of Outrageous Tales.  Neil Gaiman, the Minnesota-based former Englishman who wrote the world- acclaimed DC Comics series Sandman, is a prominent Jewish comics-writer,  although his experience of Jewishness is very distinctive. In an interview in  which Gaiman tries to articulate a description of his childhood, in regard to  the issue of Jewishness, he states: I was brought up Jewish. But I was Jewish and attended High Church of Eng- land schools, which is everything you get in Catholic education, without nuns.  It was a lovely way of receiving all the religion one ever needed, as an outsider. It  was very odd. I was the kid scoring the top marks in religious studies despite the  fact that the religious studies would be on the Book of Matthew or whatever and I  wasn’t even a Christian, which was a lovely position to be in. One got everything  as an outsider.1 1Robert K. Elder, “Gods and Other Monsters: A Sandman Exit Interview and Phil- osophical Omnibus,” interview with Neil Gaiman, in Darrell Schweitzer, ed., The Neil  Gaiman Reader (Holicong: Wildside Press, 2007), p. 71.  Vol. 29, No. 2   ♦   2011 </page> <page sequence="2"> 7 8  ♦  Cyril Camus     His Jewish identity certainly made him an “outsider” in his Anglican edu- cational environment, but being half immersed in another belief-system than  his family’s, from an early age on, actually allowed him to put both systems in  perspective. As he puts it, “in a sense, it made [him] view everything as myth.”2  So his situation made him more or less an “outsider” to Jewish faith too. Now- adays he describes himself as a believer, but he is unable to name a particular  dogma to which he adheres. His comics and other writings often feature pa- gan gods and mythological beings from many different traditions, interacting  with one another. As for “believ[ing] in a biblical god,” he claims: “sometimes  I do and sometimes I don’t.”3 It is as if the spiritual stance he had decided to  adopt was the same as Samantha Black Crow’s in his novel American Gods  (“I can believe . . . anything”),4 or the child protagonist’s in his semi-autobio- graphical short story “One Life, Furnished in Early Moorcock” (“a magnifi- cent anarchy of belief ”).5 This is, at least, Bethany Alexander’s reading of his  works.6 Gaiman certainly retains a fond but detached outlook on his Jewish  roots, which he seems to deal with, in interviews, in the same half respectful,  half tongue-in-cheek idiom that he uses, in his fictions, for any religion or  myth: “I don’t think I’ve particularly practiced since my bar mitzvah. Then  again, I take a certain amount of comfort in the fact that if ever anywhere they  institute the camps and they want to start sticking Jews in them again, I’d go in  and fry. I don’t think it’s something one particularly stops being because you’ve  stopped practicing.”7 2Interview, in Hy Bender, The Sandman Companion, 2nd ed.

Gaiman is probably at his most Jewish when  he displays such a wry sense of humor, as when referring to a hypothetical new Holocaust  by incongruously claiming to take “a certain amount of comfort” at the idea, trivially ex- pressed, that “[he]’d go in and fry.” Indeed, “Jewish humor” is often construed as “disturbing  and upsetting, its phrases dipped in tragedy” (Irving Howe, “The Nature of Jewish laughter”  [1951] in Sarah Blacher Cohen, ed., Jewish Wry: Essays on Jewish Humor [Bloomington:  Indiana University Press, 1987], p. 19). And yet, as Gaiman’s phrasing illustrates, it does  not consist in “imagining that it would be appropriate to seek fulfillment through suffering,  to create a mythology out of suffering,” and it is rather used  “as much to shrug at adversity  Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="3">  The “Outsider” ♦ 79 Being a believer and having, at the same time, an outsider’s outlook on  the belief-systems most familiar to him could easily qualify him, making due  allowances, as a sort of modern-day Kafka,8 if it were not for his being abso- lutely not melancholy about his condition. Quite on the contrary, he states, “I  actually love feeling like an outsider. For example, I really enjoyed the first six  years I spent in the U.S. because everything was so alien. I’m starting to get  used to America now, which makes me think it may be time to move some- where else.”9 This cheerful embracing of the privileged position of the “alien”  often shows on a close analysis of his writings. “Part of Sandman’s dynamic  stemmed from Neil’s discovery and fascination, as both a European and an  Englishman, with America,” if we are to believe Mike Dringenberg, one of  Sandman’s pencilers, inkers and co-creators.10 It is even truer with American  Gods, as the meditation on American culture is more explicit (hence, the title),  and as Gaiman emphasizes the importance of his outlook as an outsider when  discussing the book: “I don’t think American Gods could have been written by  someone who was American. A lot of that is because, if you’re a goldfish in the  water, you don’t go, ‘This water tastes odd.’ You go, ‘This is what water tastes  like.’”11 Similarly, instances of Gaiman enjoying the feeling of being an outsider  as to bear it” (Robert Alter, “Jewish Humor and the Domestication of Myth,” in Cohen, ed.,  Jewish Wry, p. 26). 8Franz Kafka is usually depicted as the archetypal outsider. His personal friend and  first biographer, Max Brod, quotes from Kafka’s diary: “I am often seized with a sad but  calm astonishment at my lack of feeling. I am separated from everything by a space to  whose limits I can’t even force my way out” (Max Brod, Franz Kafka: A Biography [1937],  trans. G. Humphreys Roberts and Richard Winston [Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press:  1995], p. 96). American playwright and essayist David Zane Mairowitz wrote a comic- book biography (illustrated by Robert Crumb), in which he states that “Kafka was alien- ated from his country, his surroundings, his family,” and that “he was also a stranger in his  own body” (David Zane Mairowitz and Robert Crumb, Kafka, ed. Richard Appignanesi  [Seattle: Fantagraphics Books, 2007], p. 37). As for the late Pierre Desproges, a French  satirist who admired Kafka’s writings very much, he had this comment about the Jewish- Czech author: “He had life the way someone has cancer” (Pierre Desproges, Dictionnaire  superflu à l’usage de l’élite et des bien nantis [Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1985], pp. 102–103  [translation mine]).    9Bender, The Sandman Companion, p. 106. 10Interview with Mike Dringenberg, in Joseph McCabe, Hanging Out with the Dream  King: Interviews with Neil Gaiman and his Collaborators (Seattle: Fantagraphics Books,  2004), p. 80. 11Interview Stephen Bissette/Neil Gaiman, in Hank Wagner, Christopher Golden  and Stephen Bissette, Prince of Stories: the Many Worlds of Neil Gaiman (New York: St   Vol. 29, No. 2   ♦   2011 </page> <page sequence="4"> 80 ♦ Cyril Camus     can easily be traced as far as religion is concerned. A reader who is trying to  understand Gaiman’s relationship to the one fundamental text of Jewish faith  and culture-the Old Testament-might find two of such instances very tell- ing. And these instances are, namely, the intertextual borrowings from, and  rewritings of, the sacred book contained, on the one hand, in Sandman, and on  the other hand, in Outrageous Tales from the Old Testament. The latter (and, chronologically speaking, the first) is an anthology of  short, black-and-white graphic narratives that was released in 1987 by the  British publishing house Knockabout Comics.12 As the title suggests, all of  these narratives are adapted from the Old Testament. Nearly all the contribu- tors are British comics-writers and comics-artists: e.g., Alan Moore wrote “Le- viticus”, which was illustrated by Hunt Emerson, and Dave Gibbons wrote  and illustrated “Sodom and Gomorrah.” Kim Deitch, who wrote and illus- trated “The Story of Job,” is the only American contributor. Gaiman, who still  lived in England at the time, contributed not one (as the other writers did), but  six different scripts. That might be a good measure of his interest in the proj- ect. But what, exactly, was this project about? Obviously, from the title again, it  can easily be inferred that it did not consist in faithful and graphically neutral  remakes of the biblical texts, of the kind one could have found in Classics Illus- Martin’s Press, 2008), 493. This theory of Gaiman’s concerning the advantages of being  an English immigrant is very interesting as Danny Fingeroth, a comics-scholar, teacher and  a former editor and writer for Marvel Comics, has exactly the same theory about being a  Jewish immigrant. And it explains, to him, the historical predominant presence of scions of  Eastern European Jews in the American comics industry, as well as in Hollywood: “It can be  argued that the reason immigrants in general, and Jews in particular, thrive in open societies  like the United States is because they bring a unique outlook to the party, seeing insight and  opportunity where others can’t or don’t, because the values and vagaries of a society are so  familiar to its natives as to be invisible. Add to that the feelings of persecution and alien- ation . . .  and you have a perfect group of outsiders ready to reflect a culture back on itself ”  (Danny Fingeroth, Disguised as Clark Kent: Jews, Comics, and the Creation of the Superhero  [New York: the Continuum International Publishing Group Inc., 2007], p. 101).   12Knockabout publications are considered “alternative,” as the firm does not publish  straightforwardly entertaining materials such as superhero or adventure/fantasy comics  (usually called “mainstream” comics). Instead, they concentrate on intellectual, experimen- tal, and/or satirical comics, in the tradition of underground “comix” from the 1960s and  1970s. They distribute the works of American underground legends such as Robert Crumb  in the United Kingdom, and they publish many works by British creators as well. Their  best-known and most emblematic publication by locals is probably From Hell, the histori- cal and sociological graphic novel about Jack the Ripper and the Victorian era, by English  writer Alan Moore and Scottish artist Eddie Campbell.

The “iconic”14 visual style  that is used in most narratives in Outrageous Tales from the Old Testament, as  well as their humorous, cynical emphasis on violence and sex, are pervasive  clues of the comix inspiration of the anthology. As for the debt to EC Comics,  it appears more clearly in one particular story (one of Gaiman’s), and we will  come back to it a little later.      To understand what Outrageous Tales from the Old Testament is all about,  it seems particularly relevant to stress that various theoretical works have  shown that violence and fear are important aspects of the religious experience.  Theologian Rudolf Otto has identified the “tremendum,” i.e. “awe,” inspired by  the power of the deity, as a primordial part of the “numinous,” the irrational  feeling that lies at the core of the rational concept of the “holy.”15 Philosopher  René Girard has touched on this idea of awe at strange, inhuman power, but  his interest was not so much in religious psychology as in religious sociology.  Therefore, such considerations are meant, above all, to lead him to his point,  i.e., how the deep-seated fear of human aggression bears on the founding of a  religious community: The sacred consists of all those forces whose dominance over man increases or  seems to increase in proportion to man’s effort to master them. Tempests, for- est fires, and plagues, among other phenomena, may be classified as sacred. Far  outranking these, however, though in a far less obvious manner, stands human  violence-violence seen as something exterior to man and henceforth as a part  13This famous American line of didactic comics for children used to adapt (in a very  stately species of graphic narrative) historical events, tales from the Bible, and great lit- erary classics such as those by Homer, Melville, Shakespeare, etc. It ran discontinuously  from 1941 to 1971 and was successively owned by two publishing companies, Gilberton  Company and Frawley Corporation. Gilberton publications are discussed and analyzed in  Joseph Witek, Comic Books as History: the Narrative Art of Jack Jackson, Art Spiegelman and  Harvey Pekar ( Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 1989), pp. 14–17 and 20–36. 14I use this adjective in the same meaning as Scott McCloud, who often uses it as  a synonym for an “abstract,” or “simple” visual style, and who once parenthetically equates  it with “cartoony” (Scott McCloud, Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art [New York:  HarperCollins Publishers, 1993], p. 37).  15For the respective definitions of the “numinous” and the “tremendum,” see Rudolf  Otto, The Idea of the Holy, trans.

Violence is the heart and  secret soul of the sacred.16 Girard understands ritual murder and other sacrificial practices in primitive  and ancient religious communities as an implicit model for the way any human  community, especially a religious one, builds the integrity and harmony that it  needs to preserve in order to thrive. In Girard’s terms, “the sacrificial process  prevents the spread of violence” by “polariz[ing] the community’s aggressive  impulses” (Girard 18) through the ritualizing of a “unanimous act of violence  directed against [a] surrogate victim” (Girard 280) that symbolizes any an- tagonist whom individual members of the community might have wanted to  kill or injure. Instead of “reciprocal violence, the violence that really hurts, set- ting man against man and threatening the total destruction of the commu- nity” (Girard 124–125), this process allows the community to “unite against”  (Girard 102) a “scapegoat” (Girard 79), and, by casting it out through ritual  assault, “to keep violence outside the community” (Girard 92). These reflec- tions on the mechanisms of social unity allow him to conclude: “The failure of  modern man to grasp the nature of religion has served to perpetuate its effects.  Our lack of belief serves the same function in our society that religion serves  in societies more directly exposed to essential violence. We persist in disre- garding the power of violence in human societies; that is why we are reluctant  to admit that violence and the sacred are one and the same thing” (Girard 262,  emphasis mine). It is that essential link between violence, terror, and religion that the writ- ers and artists of Outrageous Tales from the Old Testament deal with. And the  way they choose to deal with it is a peculiar kind of “caricature”-the technique,  “in a verbal description” or “in graphic art,” that consists in “exaggerat[ing] or  distort[ing], for comic effect, a person’s distinctive physical features or per- sonality traits.”17 Here, the word can be applied both to narrative aspects of  the rewritings, and to the graphic style and devices employed by the artists.  And the target of the caricature is not so much a person as a mood, the one  that can be found in the Old Testament. Caricature is, fundamentally, a hu- morous emphasis on one single aspect of a reality which is, like all realities,  multi-faceted. The trait that is emphasized at the expense of any other is, of  16René Girard, Violence and the Sacred, trans. Patrick Gregory (1972, Baltimore: The Johns  Hopkins University Press, 1977), p. 31.

Among Gaiman’s six stories for the anthology, five are adapted from the  18René Girard wrote specifically about the Bible in his book Things Hidden since the  Foundation of the World. He observes that the Old Testament more than often illustrates  the theory developed in Violence and the Sacred: “[I]n all the great scenes of Genesis and  Exodus, there is a motif, or a quasi-motif, of expulsion and the founding murder” (René Gi- rard, Des Choses cachées depuis la fondation du monde [Paris: Editions Grasset &amp; Fasquelle,  1978], p. 166 [translation mine]). However, Girard sees a striking difference between the  sacrificial ethos of primitive and ancient religions and that of the Jewish text: in the latter,  the innocence of the surrogate victim, and therefore the arbitrariness and injustice of the  founding murder, are systematically proclaimed and denounced, in a way that Girard reads  as a foreshadowing of the non-violent, “non-sacrificial” God of the Christian New Testa- ment. Yet, he notes that “a conception of the deity which would be thoroughly foreign to  violence is never actually reached in the Old Testament” (Girard 1978, p. 180, translation  mine). And, later, he contrasts the deity as described in the “synoptic Gospels” with the  “vengeful and retributive conception of which traces remain until the end of the Old Testa- ment” (Girard 1978, 206, translation mine).       19“Mysterium” and “majestas” are Otto’s concepts. They are, like “tremendum,” aspects of  the numinous. The “majestas” or “absolute overpoweringness” of a numinous object (The Idea  of the Holy, pp. 19–23), combined with its “mysterium,” i.e., completely alien and incompre- hensible nature (The Idea of the Holy, pp. 25–30), are the reasons why it inspires awe.  20To Otto, the very notion of “ the ‘wrath of Yahweh’ . . . is nothing but the tremendum  itself, apprehended and expressed by the aid of a naïve analogy from the domain of natural  experience, in this case from the ordinary passional life of men” (The Idea of the Holy, p. 18). 21An exploitation film is “a cheaply made film which relies on explicit displays of sex  . . . , graphic passages of violence or sordid or sensationalist subject matter to reach an audi- ence” (Kevin Jackson, The Language of Cinema [Manchester: Carcanet Press Ltd, 1998], p.  86). The promotion of such movies usually relies on various ways of boasting their outré  character, including sensationalist taglines on the posters or in the trailers, and more gener- ally, as Eric Schaefer has it in his study on early exploitation cinema, “bombastic promises   Vol. 29, No. 2   ♦   2011 </page> <page sequence="8"> 84 ♦ Cyril Camus     Figure 1.

The first chapters of this Book depict Yahweh’s recurrent punishments  against the Israelites, because, as an angel explains: “And ye shall make no  league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but  ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this? Wherefore I also said,  I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your  sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.”22 After that, time and again,  Yahweh’s Jewish followers, caught worshipping “strange gods,” are enslaved by  other Semitic people with Yahweh’s consent, and then he sends “Judges” to  free them. Thus is the reader confronted with an almost iterative passage, pep- pered with variants of this phrase: “and the anger of the Lord was hot against  Israel and he sold them into the hand of . . . ” ( Judges 2:14, 3:8, 4:2, and 6:1).  Gaiman and Mike Matthews’s rendering of those chapters is typical of the  general desacralizing tactics of the anthology. First, of course, it compresses  the “plot,” and simplifies its expression, in order to make as clear as possible the  tyrannous absurdity, from the point of view of a modern outsider, of Yahweh’s  behavior. Gaiman even puts, in the mouth of one of the Jewish hearers of the  angel’s message, the anachronistic comment: “Sounds like divine fascist crap to  me.”23 Then, Matthews visually emphasizes the gory aspects of every massacre  that he and Gaiman selected. The penultimate panel, notably, shows Shamgar,  one of the Judges, standing on top of a mountain of corpses (Fig. 2). The panel  would look very much like one from a warlike heroic-fantasy comics-series  such as Marvel Comics’ Savage Sword of Conan, if it were not for the iconic  style in which it is drawn, and the anachronistic and misspelled colloquialisms  printed in Shamgar’s speech balloon, which make him sound like a lampoon  of a dumb action hero. That hypotextually rich depiction satirically suggests  a purposeful likening of the Old Testament wars to the blood and combat  about shocking truths and fearless frankness” (Eric Schaefer, Bold! Daring! Shocking! True!  A History of Exploitation Films, 1919–1959 [Durham/London: Duke University Press,  1999], p. 3). The very title of the Knockabout anthology, “Outrageous Tales from,” partakes  of that paratextual pastiche of exploitation films’ promotional techniques. 22Judges 2:2–3.

Many other examples of the graphic or verbal desacralization that consti- tutes the agenda of the anthology could be cited. In Gaiman’s “Journey to Beth- lehem,” which corresponds to Chapter 19 of the Book of Judges, something  which is expressed with only one short sentence in the Old Testament-“And  [the Levite’s] concubine played the whore against him, and went away from  him unto her father’s house” ( Judges 19:2 )-is fully developed in a six-panel  scene (spread through a whole page) in the graphic adaptation. The style used  by artist Steve Gibson is even more iconic than Matthews’s, and the crude  sex panel that results from the expansion of the passage is typical of the un- apologetic obscenity and of the grotesque caricature style usually employed by  comix-creators (Fig. 4).

Later in the same story,  Gibson’s cartoony art gives a very striking, terrifying, expressionistic edge to  the horrible scene where the Benjamites gang-rape the Levite’s concubine. The  same can be said of the representation of the Levite’s cold rage, the morning  after, while he “divide[s] her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and  sen[ds] her into all the coasts of Israel” ( Judges 19:29),24 to raise all the other  Israelite tribes against the Benjamites. Irish artist Dave McKean’s work, in Gaiman’s “The Prophet Who Came  to Dinner,” is far from cartoony, although there is some abstractness to it. In  fact, it resembles the art McKean has provided for such early Gaiman graphic  novels as Violent Cases or Black Orchid: alternating impressionistic panels de- picting landscapes or sheer movement, and hyperrealistic close-ups on human  characters. The difference, with those other Gaiman/McKean collaborations,  is that this comic is neither painted, nor even inked. It is only penciled, which  makes it look like a set of very elaborate sketches. The visual mood clearly  stands out from the comix mood that predominates in the anthology. This  adaptation of Chapter 13 of the First Book of Kings25 does not look satiric. It  looks haunted, in a way which is quite typical of Dave McKean’s visual works,  and which does not seem quite devoid of aesthetic equivalents of Rudolf Ot- to’s majestas and mysterium (Fig. 5). Therefore, the necessary impertinence-or,  to put it in a more Jewish manner, the “chutzpah”-of that story lies mostly in  the contrast between that visual ambience (which is rather adequate for a seri- ous adaptation of a biblical narrative) and the ambience suggested by Gaiman’s  verbal work. The captions and speech balloons throughout the first pages con- tain mostly excerpts from the original text, and, when Gaiman’s text departs  from it, at least the style looks biblical (see Tales, 48–49). But at the bottom of  24Those scenes, in Gaiman and Gibson’s story, are to be found in Gaiman, Tales, 43– 45. In his previously quoted essay Understanding Comics, Scott McCloud suggests an ex- planation to the often-noted expressive power of abstract, cartoony drawings: “the cartoon  is a vacuum into which our identity and awareness are pulled” (p. 36). Such a process of  identification comes from the fact that detailed realism gives individual concreteness to a  drawn character, creating a distance from the reader, whereas a cartoon character looks less  like a particular human (other than the reader), and more like the vague, universal idea of  a human (which includes any reader). “By de-emphasizing the appearance of the physical  world, in favor of the idea of form,” McCloud argues, “the cartoon places itself in the world  of concepts. Through traditional realism, the comics artist can portray the world without,  and through the cartoon, the world within” (Understanding Comics, p. 41).    25More precisely, 1 Kings 13:1–32.

Hello.  I hear you’re a prophet.  Yup. You?  Yer. Business good?  Mustn’t grumble. You?  Neh! It’s a living (Tales, 50). The effect of this incongruousness is quite funny, in a way that clearly pertains  to desacralization (especially as the condition of a prophet is referred to very  casually, as if it were no more than a common trade). Yet, it is, just as clearly,  far less offensive than the humor in the rest of the anthology. The conclusion  of the story displays the same mild iconoclasm, the same “thrusting downward  from the exalted to the workaday,”26 as the captions show the narrator (an im- personal narrative voice, this time, not the “Bible Keeper”) trying and failing to  find a moral interpretation to this sad tale of God’s inscrutable ways: “And the  moral of this story is . . . never listen to anyone who says God told him what you  ought to be doing. Not even a prophet. Or you’ll get eaten by a lion on your way  home, or something. Damn. No, that can’t be right” (Tales, 52). Gaiman’s contributions to Outrageous Tales from the Old Testament would  probably not be as interesting if they could not be contrasted with his very  different approach to the biblical hypotext in Sandman. Those British short  comix would merely be a funny study in blasphemous wry, a very extreme  version of the “ironic or playful domestication of myth” that Robert Alter  finds in most Jewish humor.27 They become a clue to Gaiman’s delight in be- ing a perpetual cultural outsider, as soon as you compare them to Sandman. If  Gaiman, as a Jewish writer who understands his own native faith as an outsid- er, enthusiastically helped to give some cachet to the Knockabout systematic  desacralization of the Old Testament’s tremendum and violence, it is a work  of resacralization that can be enjoyed, as to the Old Testament characters, in  Sandman. And that is one of the many ways in which Gaiman, in what is usu- ally considered his magnum opus, approaches American mainstream comics,  and therefore American popular culture, as an outsider.       26The phrase is borrowed from Mark Shechner, “Dear Mr Einstein: Jewish Humor  and the Contradictions of Culture,” in Cohen, ed., Jewish Wry, p. 148. 27Robert Alter, “Jewish Humor and the Domestication of Myth,” in Cohen, ed., Jewish  Wry, p. 29. Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="15">  The “Outsider” ♦ 91 Contrary to Outrageous Tales from the Old Testament, Sandman is a main- stream comics work, which means that it was created under the supervision of  (and then published by) a big company whose editorial concerns are resolutely  about popular entertainment, and mostly about superheroes. This company is  DC Comics, and it is best-known for publishing in monthly comic books the  adventures of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Apart from those  emblematic figures, it owns the rights of many superheroes and other fictional  characters, and employs many writers and artists to run their multiple, inter- connected, perpetually ongoing series. Sandman is one such monthly series.  But Gaiman was not hired to write a storyline in the endless adventures of  a previously-existing DC-property hero. Instead, he created the concept and  many of the main characters. He wrote every single issue of the series (from  1988 to 1996). And, contrary to the commercial philosophy of mainstream  comics series, he killed the protagonist at the end of his run, and ensured that  DC would not try to clumsily resurrect the character under the auspices of  another writer.       Sandman has an extremely complex plot, which melts together horror/ fantasy, historical fiction, tragedy, intertextuality-based experimental narra- tive, and mythopoeia. However, it can be roughly summarized by way of two  statements. Firstly, it is the story of the Endless, seven siblings who are more  than gods; actually, they are the reason why there are gods. Indeed, the seven  of them (Destiny, Death, Dream, Destruction, Desire, Despair and Delirium)  are anthropomorphic embodiments of “eternal human traits.”28 Their very  existence is the cosmic framework that shapes human imagination, thought,  beliefs, and condition. Secondly, the protagonist is one of the Endless: Dream  (also known as Morpheus, the Sandman, the Dream-King, the Prince of Sto- ries, or the Lord-Shaper). The Endless have very distinct personalities, and  Dream is one of the most cheerless. He is a Byronic, brooding, romantically  self-centered character. More importantly, he has a very impersonal, detached  and “professional” perception of the humans over whose dreams, hopes, in- spiration, and nightmares he presides. Defining himself only by his cosmic  responsibilities (contrary to his sister Death, who is a very sympathetic and  lively character), he is, most of all, pathologically reluctant to change. The se- ries delineates the way he is forced, by circumstances, to learn human feelings,  to change, and how that leads him to the tragic decision to die, leaving his  kingdom-the Dreaming-to the rule of a new, less misfit embodiment of the  idea of Dream. 28Marilyn Brahen, “The Thin Line Between,”  in Schweitzer, Neil Gaiman Reader, p. 140.  Vol. 29, No. 2   ♦   2011 </page> <page sequence="16"> 92 ♦ Cyril Camus     Throughout the millennia-encompassing plot, the Endless interact with  Norse, Egyptian, Greek, and other gods and mythological beings, with fairy  folk, angels and demons, with historical figures such as William Shakespeare,  Augustus Caesar, Robespierre, or Joshua Norton, and with ordinary human  characters created by Gaiman. But as Sandman is a DC series, it must be noted  that it is also part of this fictional microcosm that is referred to as “the DC  Universe.” That means that all the DC characters (superheroes and otherwise)  exist inside Sandman’s diegesis, and they are therefore likely to be involved  in the plot. Characters from Batman, Superman, or members of the Justice  League of America (notably the Martian Manhunter) make cameo appear- ances. However, just as Alan Moore had done a few years earlier in his DC  series Swamp Thing, Gaiman preferred to use mostly, in Sandman, less famous  DC characters. Cain, Abel, and Eve are such characters. The three of them first appeared  as horror-hosts in DC Comics horror anthology series in the EC Comics vein.  As Hy Bender explains in his chapter on the “Secret Origins” of Sandman  characters, “Cain and Abel were respectively hosts of two highly popular titles  [in the 1970s], The House of Mystery and The House of Secrets.”29 From mere  heterodiegetic narrators, the two characters had already been made homodi- egetic (albeit with a mostly choral function) in Alan Moore’s Swamp Thing.  In Sandman, they are much more involved in the action, as they are identified  as dwellers of the Dreaming, and faithful assistants to the Dream-King. So  is Eve, a woman who is sometimes young and beautiful, sometimes old, and  who spends most of her time in a cave in the Dreaming, alone with a raven.  In a piece of interview with Bender in the “Secret Origins” chapter, Gaiman  explains where this character comes from: Tom [Peyer]’s research [in the DC archives] unearthed another obscure 1975  series, Dark Mansion of Forbidden Love, that was hosted by a beautiful unnamed  woman with a raven. That made me remember a mad crone named Eve who had  a raven, and who appeared in several other short-lived DC titles, such as Secrets  of Sinister House, Secrets of Haunted House and Plop! It occurred to me that the  beautiful woman with a raven and the crazy crone with a raven were aspects of  the same character, who was named Eve.30  Of course, Cain and Abel, who were already presented as brothers in The  House of Mystery and The House of Secrets, were clearly inspired by the epony- mous brothers in Genesis. And as for Eve, even if the connection is less obvi- 29Bender, The Sandman Companion, pp. 244–245.     30Bender, The Sandman Companion, p. 244.

Yet, the obviously intertextual nature of the characters  was never much exploited by the writers who used them before Gaiman. In  The House of Mystery, Cain is the caretaker of a Gothic mansion adjoining a  cemetery, and he spends his time telling horror stories to the reader. In The  House of Secrets, Abel does exactly the same thing, in a house at the other side  of the cemetery, and his bully brother Cain sometimes visits him, mostly to  scare him or mock him for his supposed silliness and cowardliness. In Moore’s  Swamp Thing, the characters’ houses appear to be located in some nonphysical  piece of land, overlooking Hell, and which can be visited in dreams. Moore  first introduces a vague but identifiable reference to the brothers’ biblical mod- els, in the form of a horror/slapstick routine, consisting in Cain’s recurrently  killing Abel, who resuscitates every day, so that he can be killed over again, in  a perfect illustration of Henri Bergson’s conception of the comic as “something  mechanical in something living.”31  In Sandman, the brothers are very similar to the depiction that is made  of them in Swamp Thing, except that the reader encounters them much more  often (they appeared only in two issues in Swamp Thing, “Abandoned Houses”  and “The End”32). That allows Gaiman to develop their relationships, giving  some poignancy to it, by suggesting that Abel hopes beyond hope that he and  his brother will make peace some day, or that, secretly, Cain could actually not  live without his much-reviled and often-murdered brother. More importantly,  those Gothic/slapstick characters are resacralized inasmuch as some passages  make very clear that the DC Cain, Abel, and Eve, and the Old Testament  Cain, Abel and Eve, are indeed the same.  The first of these passages occurs in the issue that serves as “Chapter 1” in  the storyline entitled “Season of Mists.” Dream needs to go to Hell and to nego- tiate something with Lucifer, but the latter bears a grudge to the Dream-King,  and a strong sense of diplomacy is required. Before going, Dream decides to  send one of his servants to announce his visit, but as Hell is a very dangerous  place for anybody who ventures there, Dream chooses to send Cain.

We may not give you our permission. Cain is under pro- tection of one far greater than the Lord of Dreams. “And the Lord said unto him,  therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold,  and the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him . . . .”  . . .  You’re under his protection. Dream was sensible to send you as his messenger  -any other envoy would have been returned with his liver in his mouth (Sand- man 2, 45).34      A few pages later, Gaiman continues weaving the explicit link between the  DC character and his Old Testament prototype, still through Lucifer’s speech  balloons. The Lord of Hell informs Cain of the existence, in the second centu- ry A.D., of a Gnostic sect named the Cainites, who believed that “Yahweh was  positively evil,” who “revere[d] such rejected figures as Cain . . . , Esau and the  Sodomites,” and who thought that “salvation . . . c[ame] only by breaking all the  laws of the Old Testament.”35 The information given by Lucifer is more or less  that, the main difference being his use of the deictic “you” instead of the name  “Cain”: “they believed that you were the persecuted party in that unfortunate  affair with your brother” (Sandman 2, 46). Referring to an obscure group in the  history of religions helps giving back to the DC character the mysterium that  belongs to his biblical roots; such information is not necessarily well-known to  the reading public of Sandman. So it can be considered as “esoteric,” in a very  literal sense. Some majestas is conferred to the character as well; a few people  actually used to revere him. The fact that Gaiman and artist Kelley Jones in- cluded the text from Genesis inside a panel actually showing the mark of Cain  also has an effect of that kind, both thanks to the natural fascination exerted  by graphic symbols whose meaning is unclear, and to the suggestion that we  are looking at a physical trace of Yahweh’s majestas, a mere circle on Cain’s flesh,  that suffices to prevent anybody from harming him (Fig. 6).   Such numinous features can also be found in the issue “A Parliament of  Rooks” (part of “Convergence,” a triptych of stories marginal to the main plot).

Cain suggests that as “old story- tellers” (an intertextual allusion  to their editorial past as horror- hosts), they should tell stories to  their guest.36 Eve and Abel suc- cessively narrate their origin sto- ries, which are easily identifiable  as similar to their Genesis coun- terparts’. Eve’s story is recogniz- able but strangely different from  the best-known Genesis tale.  Instead of Adam being made of  dust, and having only one wife,  Eve, made from his rib while he  sleeps, the story starts with a  hermaphrodite Adam, whose  female part is divided from the  male to make Adam’s first wife,  Lilith (Sandman 3, 33). As she  behaves as Adam’s equal, she is Figure 6.  Reprinted from Absolute Sandman Vol.  “expelled from Eden,” and a new 2. 45. © DC Comics. All Rights Reserved.   wife is made. But as Adam could  see her creation, “bones first, then internal organs, then flesh” and so on, Adam  can’t bear her sight, sees her as “full of secretions and blood” (Sandman 3, 34– 35). So she is also expelled, or destroyed, without even being given a name,  and finally God makes Eve, in the aforementioned manner. Actually, this ver- sion of the story is not from the Old Testament proper; a caption claims that  “that’s what the Midrash states” (Sandman 3, 35).37 Besides, Gaiman explains  in an interview: “That’s a story which has haunted me since age twelve, when  36Neil Gaiman et al., Absolute Sandman, Vol. 3 (1991–1993; collection, New York:  DC Comics, 2008), p. 28.

The cantor  happened to be an expert on Jewish Talmudic, Mishnaic and Midrashic apoc- rypha, and I found it all fascinating and pumped him for information; so by  the age of thirteen, I knew more arcane Jewish lore than most adults.”38 And here again, the “esoteric” nature, for most readers, of that Jewish lore,  and its use in the embedded story, efficiently confers mysterium to the comic- book character of Eve, while such striking images as the hermaphrodite Adam,  or the revealed process of creation of the second wife (quite realistically de- picted by artist Jill Thompson-see Fig. 7) have effects that pertain to majes- tas and tremendum. Eve’s story should be contrasted with Abel’s, in which he  tells their infant guest of his biblical troubles with Cain, and then of Dream’s  (non-biblical) decision to give asylum to the brothers in the Dreaming. Abel’s  version of the story takes the form of an upbeat nursery tale, where all the  characters (Dream, Death, Cain, and Abel) are depicted as little children, and  where the brothers end up “hugg[ing] each other joyfully” (Gaiman, Sand- man 3, 40). Thompson adapts her style to Abel’s idiosyncratic storytelling.  In the panels that reflect Abel’s fantasizing, the characters are drawn in a very  “cute” and childlike style, with “enormous heads and large eyes, but tiny noses  and mouths that appear close to their chins.”39 Gaiman wanted them to look  roughly like Sugar and Spike (two baby characters from a DC comics-series  for children, created in 1956 by Sheldon Mayer). As Thompson points out,  they eventually look a lot like “little Japanese manga figures.”40 The point of  this funny rewriting of the Genesis story in the form of a nursery tale is to  stress the excessive sweetness and innocence of the Sandman version of Abel.  The character’s craving for brotherly love gives a deep poignancy to many of  the passages in which he is murdered by Cain. In a way, Sandman takes sides  in favor of the sacrificial victim, just as the Old Testament does according to  René Girard. Thus, Gaiman adds a very empathetic, human, dimension to the  a Midrashic text from the third century that is “haggadic in character” (Watson E. Mills,  ed., The Lutterworth Dictionary of the Bible [1990; reprint, Cambridge: Mercer University  Press, 1994], p. 733). In rabbinic literature, haggadah refers to “nonprescriptive . . . descrip- tions of historical events, aphorisms, parables, proverbs, legends of biblical or post-biblical  heroes, folklore, and other materials . . . used by the rabbis to illustrate moral and ethical  duties,” as opposed to halakah which is a “prescription,” “the definition of the precise way  in which a commandment of the Torah (Law) was to be performed” (Mills, Lutterworth  Dictionary, p. 732).  38Bender, Sandman Companion, p. 154. 39Bender, Sandman Companion, p. 153. 40Bender, Sandman Companion, p. 153.

That does not prevent  the sadness below this wishful story to be as gripping as that which explic- itly pervades Eve’s tale. But Abel’s surely has nothing numinous to it. One of  the great emotional strengths of the Sandman characters is precisely the way  Gaiman alternates depictions of them either as “wholly other,”41 and therefore  creating aesthetic echoes of what the numinous may feel like, or as wholly hu- man, and eliciting the reader’s sympathy.               In his essay on the history of Jewish comics creators in America, Danny  Fingeroth reveals that, when he personally asked him in an e-mail about Jew- ish content in his writings, Gaiman answered, “I think the stuff in my work  that’s definably Jewish is probably the stuff that’s Jewish on the surface-the  midrashic . . . stories that crept into Sandman, for example. Beyond that (shrug)  it’s anyone’s guess.”42 Unlike Fingeroth’s book, this paper is not dedicated to a  psychoanalytic search for implicitly Jewish aspects, or hidden Jewish themes,  in superhero or fantasy comics. So it is not meant to go “beyond” what “is Jew- ish on the surface.” But Gaiman’s approach to explicitly Jewish content is in- teresting, just as his oblique way of dealing with much of world culture always  is.  His intimate yet detached knowledge of the Jewish sacred texts and of the  Judeo-Christian religious history gave him assets to create some powerful de- tails in his syncretic Sandman mythos. Anybody Christian could have linked  Cain, Abel, or Eve to their biblical types, but the idea of including midrashic  content probably contributed a lot to the successful aura of mysterium and ma- jestas of Eve’s tale in “A Parliament of Rooks.” Even if his ambivalent religious  education “made [him] see everything as myth,” he is thoroughly aware of the  value of myths. As to Outrageous Tales from the Old Testament, it is obvious  that the main difference between Gaiman and the other writers, apart from  the number of scripts he contributed, is that most of the others wrote about  very famous stories: Creation, the Garden of Eden, Sodom and Gomorrah,  Samson, and Job. Gaiman was one of the few who chose books that are known  mostly to people who actually read or studied the Old Testament. Filmmak- ers like Mel Brooks or the Monty Python have often shown in their careers  that there is no better parody than a parody by someone who actually knows  the original work fairly well. Gaiman’s “outrageous tales” certainly convey that  impression. Fingeroth also wrote about the “Golden Age” of the comic-books in the  late 1930s and early 1940s: “As recently deceased Jewish comics writer, Ar- 41Otto, The Idea of the Holy, p. 25. 42Fingeroth, Disguised as Clark Kent, p. 144.

The Jews were primarily writers, the Italians were primarily art- ists, and I saw it being an extension of the two cultures. Jews had always been  involved in storytelling going back to the Old Testament. The Italians had been  involved with art for centuries and centuries.’”43 As a writer whose works are  characterized by recurrent explicit intertextuality, Gaiman always overtly pays  his hypertextual debts to his hypotextual creditors. Both as a Jewish author  and as a Western popular culture author, he could not have ignored the found- ing text of the rich Jewish storytelling tradition of which he is part, especially if  this text happens to be a founding text for the whole Judeo-Christian Western  culture as well. However, as an author who also has the passion of creative  retelling, of ever-changing and ever-updating universal narratives—in a nut- shell, as someone who believes that “we have the right, or the obligation, to tell  old stories in our own ways, because they are our stories, and they must be  told”44—he sometimes pays his debts in quite unexpected ways. Ways that are  sideways: an outsider’s ways. 43Fingeroth, Disguised as Clark Kent, p. 24, emphasis mine. 44Neil Gaiman, Adventures in the Dream Trade (2002; reprint, Framingham: The  NESFA Press, 2007), p. 68.
