<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Theory of Proportion in Archi- tecture. By P. L. Scholfield. xii+ I56 pp. (50 figs.)+I7 pl. (Cambridge University Press), I IOs. Mr Scholfield gives it as 'the aim of the present study ... to state a unified theory of proportion, and to show how it arises out of, and helps to explain the history of proportional theory in the past. The first part of this programme, the statement of the theory, is performed with admirable vigour and lucidity. 'The first thing to be made clear is that we are concerned only with visual proportion, with the relation- ships of the shapes and sizes of objects which please the eye.' In other words, all the overtones, religious, metaphysical, or otherwise, which have embellished and embarrassed the idea of proportion, are rigorously excluded. Then 'it is clear that no individual rectangles are in themselves either outstandingly beautiful or out- standingly ugly. The secret of proportion lies not in the shapes themselves, but in the relationships between them.' This means in effect that it does not matter what proportions you use (within limits) so long as you use them consistently. 'Similarity of shape alone (remains) a possible key to the theory of proportion in architecture. Order can be introduced by the repetition of similar shapes, and the highest degree of order results when comparatively few shapes are used, repeated as often as possible.' It will be seen from these quotations that Mr Scholfield has a severely empirical view of proportion. His argument is carried on in language that is wholly free from the verbal obscurities or conceptual absurdities which often make the literature of this subject painful to read. This is the only way in which the topic of proportion can be discussed nowadays with intelli- gence and profit, and Mr Scholfield will no doubt be read with great respect by students of contemporary architecture. If one has any reservations to make about this book, it is the handling of the second part of the author's programme - the historical perspective in which he sees and sets his theory - that provokes them. No doubt he never intended to write a history of proportion in architecture, so it is no use criticizing him for not doing so. But one may wonder whether his un- compromisingly enlightened attitude really offers as much scope for an elucidation of the past as he seems to think. The drastic pruning which deserves to be acclaimed in one context, leaves hardly anything of that woolly-minded, metaphysical, and super- stitious nonsense that once passed for erudition and concealed so much ignor- ance, and which is the chief ground for historical and antiquarian interest in the subject. He makes things easy for himself by excluding from consideration all in- ferences derived from archaeological evi- dence, on the grounds that inductive analysis is unreliable. This allows him to deal with antiquity through the solitary THE LITERATURE OF ART figure of Vitruvius, and to avoid the whole of the Middle Ages. While these omissions do not necessarily prejudice his argument, they do entail an extremely narrow and unhistorical picture of the scope and meaning of proportion. However much we may sympathize with his exasperation at being confronted with innumerable analyses of the Parthe- non, all different, the Parthenon is none- theless a more important piece of evidence for what the ancients thought about pro- portion in architecture than all the writings of Vitruvius. Anyone who has attempted to make sense of the classical Greek temples in the light of what Vitruvius has to say about them may be forgiven for feeling that his importance arises from the largely fortuitous circum- stances that, like Sieyes, he survived. His importance for Mr Scholfield is that Mr Scholfield thinks he can make sense of his remarks on proportion in terms of his own views. This is something anyway. The exclusion of the Middle Ages is more serious. For whereas it is possible to make out a case for supposing that the ancients thought along Mr Scholfield's lines, the medieval evidence, which is not inconsiderable, indicates a totally different outlook. It is quite certain that medieval masons did use proportions, but it is highly unlikely that they thought of them pri- marily or even at all as a method of making their buildings beautiful to the eye. In the Middle Ages when the mechanical sciences were little more than anthropomorphic intuitions, the planning of buildings was to a considerable extent the application to a given task of an accumulated store of traditional wisdom. Thus it might be taught in the masonic lodges that if you built your foundations of such and such dimensions, and had walls and buttresses of such and such width and depth, and so on, then you could take your building up to a certain height and reasonably expect on the basis of past experience that it would stay up. This experience was summed up in simple rules of proportion. What lay outside these rules was unknown. Sometimes they were flouted and when they were flouted successfully, medieval architecture made one of its fitful advan- ces. But it is interesting to observe that when this happened, as in the transition from Romanesque to Gothic, it was not the proportions themselves so much as the ways in which they were used, that changed. It is therefore possible that their practical value was held to be due to some intrinsic excellence which they enjoyed by virtue of their cosmological or religious significance. At any rate there are grounds for thinking that in the Middle Ages at least it did matter very much what par- ticular proportions were used. But this carping should not be taken too seriously. It amounts to saying that Mr Scholfield knows rather less about antiqui- ty and the Middle Ages than he does about the Renaissance and modern times; and as his problem is fundamentally a con- temporary one, this is no great blemish. The clarity and sense of what he says more than compensates for any lack of eru- dition. P. KIDSON Pre-Colombian Art, the Robert Woods Bliss Collection. By S. K. Lothrop and others. I20 pp. (31 figs.)+165 pl. (I22 in colour). (Phaidon Press), 7 7s. This magnificent work is, as its sub-title implies, the reflection of the personality and taste of a great private collector. A happy chance in Paris in I9I2 caused Mr Bliss to make his first purchase of an American antiquity, an Olmec figurine of blue-green jade. Since then he has allowed his taste and feelings as a collector to range over the whole field of the art of Central and South America from the formative period - possibly about 1500 B.C. to the Spanish conquest. The earliest periods, the 'formative' in Central America and the Chavin in Peru, correspond in feeling to the Neolithic of Europe, and while the material civilization remains virtually neolithic until the time of Columbus, the religious, aesthetic, and social outlook of the early Americans may be compared in the 'classic' period lasting from A.D.300 to A.D.900 to that of ancient Greece and Rome. In Mexico there then intervened the period of the Toltecs, followed by some two or three hundred years of confusion, of savage nomads, and migrations, not unlike the dark ages in Europe. Then, in the Aztec period, there emerged a more stable culture, barbaric and cruel in many respects, but a period of great material wealth. Over such a wide range of space and time it is difficult to find any unity in theme. Mr Bliss has approached the subject of his collection in the spirit of a connoisseur of fine art, collecting beautiful specimens, in almost every conceivable medium, stone, shell, pottery, textiles, and gold- work. In Mexico and Central America the early formative period (about 1000 B.C.- A.D.300) is presented by the magnificent jade figurines and carvings of the Gulf Coast, mostly worked in the bluish-green jade which first attracted him in I912. In the material of this culture can be seen two tendencies at work - a striving after the naturalistic and simple, and the iconographic complications necessary to the representation to the ferocious nature of the gods they worshipped. The sensitive modelling of a blue jadeite bust (plate 3) and the charming simplicity of figurines are in strong contrast to the formalized malevolence of the ferocious feline deity of the bottom of plate I. This dual motive seems to survive throughout all periods in Central America. In strong contrast to the simplicity of the Olmec jades is the group of highly conventionalized jade pendants and amulets from Nicoya and Guapiles in Costa Rica. 75</page><page sequence="2">The classic period is represented by stuccoed pottery and a fresco of Teotihua- can style and some magnificent examples of the so-called hachas - thin stone carv- ings of heads in relief from the Gulf Coast, and by magnificently carved stone heads, and pottery of the Maya. Perhaps the best piece in the whole collection is the stone head of a Maize God, from Copan, Honduras, which has all the serenity of the best Maya art. The pottery of the Maya in the classic period had a great many variations; polychrome and carved bowls are well represented. There are in the collection a number of figurines from the island of Jaina, a class of object about which there has been much controversy among arche- ologists. Gold working only reached Central America at a late date from Colombia and Peru, and as a result the great part of the Gold in the collection comes either from Panama or South America. Most of this takes the form of pendants, cast by the cire perdu method, in the forms of man, birds, probably the eagle or condor, frogs, and other reptiles. Repoussee work from Veraguas and the well-known site of Code is mostly in the form of circular discs with monstrous deities in relief. The Aztecs, who only emerged from barbarism at about this time of King John, developed a style of sculpture, at once naturalistic and conventional, but simpler than that of their predecessors. A basalt figurine of Chalchihuitlicue, the Goddess of flowers, illustrates the point, and a stone figure of a coiled rattlesnake (plate XL) is an almost perfect geometric shape but contains the sinister menace of all snakes. There is the usual emphasis, so characteristic of the Aztecs, on death and sacrifice in a figure of the god Xipe Totec, dressed in a flayed human skin and in a number of representations in shell and stone, of human skulls. From South America the specimens illustrated in the catalogue are not so representative. Gold in plenty is shown from Colombia, Venezuela, and Peru, but the only two pieces of pottery are a double spouted vase of Nasca style, and a stirrup mouthed vase showing two gulls quarrel- ling over a fish. It is, however, in the textiles that the collection is really strong. The illustrations of the textiles, with their delicate colours and intricate geometric designs are perhaps the most pleasing of all. An archeological skeleton to give co- herence to the plates, and to place the catalogue entries in their proper perspec- tive, has been prepared by Dr S. K. Lothrop, who also wrote the catalogue, in a thirty-seven page chapter on cultures and styles, which he treats regionally, and extremely clearly, illustrating this section of the book with several half-tone text figures. There are other sections: on 'mineralogical attributes' by W. F. Foshag; and on textiles by Miss Joy Mahler. The catalogue entries show the scholarship we 76 THE LITERATURE OF ART would expect from Dr Lothrop and are a source of valuable information to the archeologist as well as to the aesthete. The photographs are the work of Mr Nicholas Muray, and although his name appears in the long list of acknowledge- ments it is a little surprising that his name does not appear on the title page. ADRIAN DIGBY A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful. By Edmund Burke. Edited with an Introduction and Notes by J. T. Boulton. cxxx+ 97 pp. (Rout- ledge and Kegan Paul), LI I2S. Edmund Burke has at last become the object of serious research. J. T. Boulton of Nottingham University gives us the Enquiry in its first modern, annotated edi- tion, and T. W. Copeland of Massachusetts is editing the correspondence in ten vol- umes. Burke's polemical oratory in the House of Commons has for too long held pride of place, and the Enquiry has been too long out of print (as I remarked recently in this journal). Horace Walpole, in one of his witty dismissals of the great, said Milton was 'all imagination, and a thousand times more sublime and spirited' than Virgil, yet produced 'a monster'. The monster was indeed 'sublime', but neither Walpole nor Reynolds used the word in the same sense as Edmund Burke. The philosopher regarded Paradise Lost as the work of 'our great poet', and found in it one of his sources of sublimity. Burke's sublimity was not a general term for grandeur, but an aesthetic, sensationist experience based on terror. The widely read contemporary translation of Longinus, by William Smith, prepared the way for Burke's aesthetic of terror, but his definition had no precedent and was an innovation of considerable importance. In his excellent introduction Mr Boulton sets Burke's innovation in its proper con- text, by not only analysing every aspect of Burke's philosophy (including the gener- ally neglected section 'Of Words') but also the philosophical precedents for Burke's aesthetic theories. By a judicious selection of passages Boulton shows how Burke's ideas derive from wide sources, going back to Plato, Longinus, and the Renaissance. Nearer his own time, Burke was indebted to Shaftesbury, Boileau, Hume, Hutche- son, Du Bos, John Baillie, and John Dennis. Boulton has some interesting comments to make on the ideas in Dennis's Grounds of Criticism in Poetry ( 704): The objects of religious ideas, because they are the most powerful, provide the sources of the greatest enthusiastic terror. And further hints of what is to come in Burke's theory are found in Dennis's interest in the power of God, coupled with the obscurity which surrounds the limits of His power and therefore His capacity to inflict pain. Indeed, Dennis is a significant forerunner of Burke in the general stress he lays on violent emotion. The Editor also discusses more im- mediate influences on Burke, in the form of personal environment at the time the Enquiry was being composed. While a student at Trinity College, Dublin (from I744 onwards) Burke had been compelled to read Longinus as a compulsory text in his 'Sophister years'. Also while at Dublin the 'Club' had been founded whose object was 'a weekly club instituted for the im- provement of its members in the more refin'd elegant and usefull parts of Litterature'. The debates of the Club were used by Burke as a testing ground for his drafts for the Enquiry. Not only was a debate on poetry held under his presidency, but he also made 'a Declamation on praise of painting', and also (which is more important) debated with Dennis 'whether Philisophy be of use to Poetry'. The minutes of this debate show Burke using ideas identical with those expressed in the Enquiry. When first published in I757 the Enquiry received long reviews in the main literary periodicals. It was on the whole favourably received and the newness of many of the ideas acknowledged, but the theory in toto was not accepted. Boulton quotes the critic of the Literary Magazine: Upon the whole, though we think the author of this piece mistaken in his fundamental principles, and also in his deductions from them; yet we must say, we have read his book with pleasure. Boulton completes his introduction by what is in many ways the most interesting and revealing aspect of the Enquiry: namely, its influence on contemporary writers and artists. Whereas contemporary English philosophers did not agree with Burke's main theory, artists and writers had no such qualms. William Blake was almost exceptional among artists in his expressed 'Contempt &amp; Abhorrence' for Burke's work. Samuel Johnson and the orientalist William Jones, for instance, were joined not only by 'picturesque' theorists and Lake District admirers, but also by James Barry, Henry Fuseli, John Martin, and David Cox. The P.R.A. himself merely mentions the Enquiry in a footnote in his Discourses. Only occasionally does he show that he was influenced by Burke; although his con- ception of the sublime is basically very different, he does admit, for example, obscurity as one of its sources. The 'picturesque' theory of Uvedale Price could, and did, find justification in Burke: wild nature, sudden variation, and irregu- larity of landscape, together with the 'picturesqueness' of Salvator Rosa. James Barry, whose theory generally belongs to the classical, academic tradi- tion, mingled it with an admiration for Michelangelo, a few Gothic works and Burke's sublime. Henry Fuseli's theory is more complex than Barry's; the Gothic trait is stronger and blended with Sturm und Drang. But the influence of Burke is still there, in both his writings and his paintings. I would add one more artist to Boulton's introduction, namely John</page></plain_text>
