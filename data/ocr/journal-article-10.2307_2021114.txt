<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME XLIX, No. 16 JULY 31, 1952 THE JOuRNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ON THE DEFINITION OF THE CAUSAL RELATION' I N a recent paper in Mind,2 Professor Arthur W. Burks has made an interesting proposal for the construction of a logic of causal propositions. Such a logic is greatly needed, for however completely the word "cause" has been eliminated from epistemology, it is still very much a part of the working vocabulary of most empirical scientists. Professor Burks begins, wisely, by avoiding the Humean controversy, and asks instead whether it is possible to give a clear and consistent explication within a system of logic of the term "cause" as it is used in common speech. While I am wholly in accord with Professor Burks' suggestion that such an explication is possible and useful, my own investigations into the question have led me to a definitional proposal that is somewhat different from his. 1. INTRODUCTION We shall take as our problem, then, the introduction into a system of logic of a relation between sentences that is equivalent, or as nearly equivalent as is feasible, to the relation of "causation" as that relation is used in scientific writing. A number of points regarding the undertaking should be made clear at the outset: a. Our undertaking is logical rather than ontological. That is, we wish to be able to assert: "The sentence A stands in a causal relation to the sentence B (in a specified system of sentences)"; and not: "That which is denoted by sentence A causes that which is denoted by sentence B." Hence, the causal relation that we shall introduce is in the metalanguage and not in the object language. b. We shall require that the causal relation be an asymmetrical one-that "A causes B" be incompatible with "B causes A." Our requirement will be even somewhat stronger. We shall so define the relation that "A causes B" is incompatible with "not-B causes not-A." 3 The reason for the requirement is, again, that we wish ' Professors Arthur Burks, Herbert Feigl, Emile Grunberg, Tjalling Koop- mans, and Manley Thompson have been most helpful in commenting on earlier drafts of this paper. 2Arthur W. Burks, "The Logic of Causal Propositions," Mind, Vol. LX (1951), pp. 363-382. 3 This is one fundamental departure of the present proposal from that of Professor Burks, whose causal relation is asymmetrical, but only in the sense that the implication relation is asymmetrical. Thus, in his system, from "A causes B" it follows that "not-B causes not-A." (Op. cit., p. 369.) 517</page><page sequence="2">518 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY to keep as close as possible to ordinary usage. Ordinary usage does not sanction: "If the rain causes Jones to wear his raincoat, then Jones' not wearing his raincoat causes it not to rain." I c. We shall avoid the usual assumption that the asymmetry of cause and effect has something to do with sequence in time. From the proposition that "A causes B" it will not be possible to draw any inference as to the time sequence of the events denoted by A and B, respectively. The reason is that in many instances where the scien- tist speaks of cause (e.g., "force causes acceleration") no time sequence is involved.5 d. Initially, we shall restrict our definition to models of experi- mental systems-that is, systems in which an experimenter can alter the values of certain variables, or the truth-values of certain propositions. I think it can be verified that in scientific literature the word "cause" most often occurs in connection with some explicit or implicit notion of an experimenter's intervention in a system. The word is used frequently in experimental physiology, seldom in astronomy. After the definition has been developed fully, this point will be discussed further. 2. CONSTRUCTION OF THE DEFINITION Our construction of a logic of causality will be limited initially to the calculus of propositions, and, indeed, to systems involving a finite number of atomic sentences. This restriction will permit us to deal with the problem in its barest essentials, and even so we shall not find it lacking in complications.6 We begin with a set of n atomic sentences, a1, . . ., an, which are assumed to be empirical and logically independent. We define as a state-description a molecular sentence (a) that is the conjunction of atomic sentences and their 4Insofar as it is possible, I shall employ Professor Burks' examples to permit easy comparison between his definition and mine. 5 Time sequence is integrally involved in Mill's theory of causation. His canons of induction only permit the inference of invariant relation, and to this must be added a time sequence in order to distinguish between cause and effect. It may well be empirically true that, in most or all cases where "A causes B" is true, A precedes B in time; but we do not wish to incorporate this requirement in our definition. 6In another paper, the author has shown how the same kind of causal relation can be introduced in ordinary algebraic systems of simultaneous equations. See "Causal Ordering and Identifiability," Chapter 3 in T. Koopmans (ed.), Econometric Methods (Cowles Commission Monograph 14), forthcoming. A sim- ilar definition has been arrived at independently by Professor Guy Orcutt of Harvard University. See his abstract, "The Influence of Causation," Econo- metrica, Vol. 19 (January, 1951), p. 60. A definition along the same lines, but developed less formally, was proposed by Lewis A. Dexter, "Causal Imputation and Purposes of Investigation," Philosophy of Science, Vol. 6 (1939), pp. 404-410.</page><page sequence="3">ON DEFINITION OF CAUSAL RELATION 519 negations, and (b) in which each atomic sentence or its negation (but not both) appears once (e.g., a1. -a2. ... an 1.-an.).7 A state- description designates a state. In saying that the sentences are empirically testable we mean that we can determine empirically which state-description is true; and in saying they are logically inde- pendent we mean that no state-description is self-contradictory. We define as an empirical law a molecular sentence formed from one or more of the n atomic sentences. We describe a state-descrip- tion, Si, as realizable (i.e., the corresponding state is empirically possible) relative to a set of laws, P1, ., Pk, if P1 . P2 . . . Pk. SA is not self-contradictory.8 A set of empirical laws is complete for a set of atomic sentences if only a single unique state-description is realizable relative to this set of laws-i.e., if PI . . . Pk. Si is self-contradictory except for a single state-description Sj. The empirical laws form a minimal com- plete set for the atomic sentences if no proper subset of the laws is complete for that set of sentences. Example: Let a be the atomic sentence stating that a lighted match is observed in a room at time t; b the atomic sentence stating that an explosion is observed to occur in the room at time t. Then the state-descriptions are: a. b, -a. b, a. -b, and -a. -b. Let A be the empirical law defined by: A a; let B be the empirical law defined by: B-=.-avb. Then a.b and a.-b are realizable relative to A; a.b, -a. b, and -a. -b are realizable relative to B; while only a. b is realiz- able relative to the set comprised of A and B. Hence, this latter set is a complete set, and indeed a minimal complete set, for the atomic sentences a and b. The state-descriptions that are realizable relative to a set of laws characterize the set extensionally. Hence, if we substitute for a set of laws another set that is extensionally equivalent, the set of state-descriptions that is realizable will remain invariant. For ex- ample, define: A' b and B' . a b. Then only a. b is realizable relative to the set comprised of A' and B', and A'. B' is equivalent to A.B. However, it does not follow that, if we have two sets of laws that are extensionally equivalent, we can set up a one-one corre- spondence between the individual laws comprising the two sets, such that the members of each pair are extensionally equivalent. In the previous example, A' is equivalent to neither A nor B; nor is B' equivalent to A or B. We may express this by saying that if two 7Cf.

Carnap, op. cit., pp. 95-97.</page><page sequence="4">520 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY sets of laws are extensionally equivalent, yet the sets need not be isomorphic. Now we propose to define causality in terms of this notion of isomorphism. Given a set of atomic sentences, and a minimal com- plete set of laws for them, we wish to specify what causal relations among the sentences are implied by these laws. To accomplish this we will need one more definition. We will say that a set of empirical laws determines an atomic sentence, ak, if only state-descriptions in which ak appears or only state-descriptions in which -ak appears are realizable relative to this set of laws. Then a complete set of laws for a set of n sentences determines, simultaneously, all n sentences. For a complete set of laws, Pi, . . ., Pk, form the smallest subset, R1, that determines a1, the smallest subset, R2, that determines a2, and so on. Then we will say that aj has causal precedence over a if the set Rj is properly included in the set Ri. We will say that a. and a are mutually dependent if Rj and Ri are identical; we will say that aj and ai are independent if R, and Ri are disjunct. Taking again the propositions a and b, and the laws A and B as example, we find that (A) is the smallest set that determines a and (A, B) is the smallest set that determines b. Since (A) is included in (A, B), it follows that a has causal precedence over b-we can say (elliptically) that "the lighted match causes the explo- sion." On the other hand, taking the extensionally equivalent laws A' and B', we find that, relative to these, b is determined by (A') and a by (A', B'). Hence, b has causal precedence over a relative to the set of laws (A', B'). This completes the first formal definition of the causal relation. We see that it is a relation in the metalanguage that induces a partial ordering among the members of a set of atomic sentences. More- over, this ordering is defined relatively to a minimal complete set of molecular sentences (laws) that determines a single state-description of the atomic sentences as realizable. Finally, the ordering may be altered if for the original set of laws we substitute a different, but extensionally equivalent set. 3. SOME EXAMPLES OF CAUSAL RELATIONS The meaning of the proposed definition may be clearer if illus- trated by two more examples: (I) Let a be: "It is raining." Let b be: "John is wearing his raincoat." Let A -a, and B_ a_b. Then (A, B) is a minimal complete set of laws for (a, b). Again a is determined by (A), and b by (A, B); hence, by definition, a causes b-"Rain causes John to wear his raincoat." Suppose now that we have -A instead of A.</page><page sequence="5">ON DEFINITION OF CAUSAL RELATION 521 Now (-A, B) is a minimal complete set of laws for (a, b). In this case we can still say that "rain causes John to wear his raincoat," but we can express the new situation more felicitously by the coun- terfactual conditional: "If it had rained, John would have worn his raincoat." We see from this example that the causal relation rests, not upon the truth or falsehood of a or b, but upon (i) the assumed "lawful" connection between them expressed by B, and (ii) the "independent" determination of a expressed by A or -A.9 Perhaps the best way of expressing the relation is by saying: "The state of the weather is the cause of John's attire." (II) Consider next a slightly more complicated example. Let a be: "There is more than the usual rainfall this year"; b: "The wheat crop is large this year"; c: "The price of wheat is low this year." Take as laws: A-a; B-.a-b; and C-b-c. Then we can say: "The large rainfall caused a large wheat crop, and this caused the price of wheat to be low." A may be regarded as exten- sionally equivalent to the whole concatenation of initial conditions and laws that determines the weather; B to the botanical laws governing the growth of wheat; and C to the demand function determining the price at which a wheat crop can be sold. In this case, again, A can be replaced by -A without disturbing the causal ordering. Likewise, B can be replaced by -B (the causal ordering would be the same with a variety of wheat that was drought- resistant but damaged by excessive moisture); and C can be replaced by -C (the causal ordering would be the same if there were a positive rather than a negative demand relation between quantity and price). 4. THE PROBLEM OF INVARIANCE Before we can regard this explication of the causal relation as satisfactory, several questions must be answered. These concern the notion of "lawful connection," and the related notion that one or more of our atomic sentences (in our examples, sentence a) can be determined "independently" of the others. We do not propose to deal with the problem of confirmation of laws, but only with prob- lems of their meaning.'0 I This explains why, in distinction to other explications of the causal relation (e.g., that of Burks, op. cit., p. 369), ours does not permit the inference of "-b causes -a" from "a causes b." Definitions of cause that interpret that relation as somehow analogous to the relation of implication can hardly be expected to avoid this difficulty. 10 The importance of settling the question of meaning prior to the question of confirmation has been pointed out by Elizabeth Lane Beardsley, " 'Non- Accidental' and Counterfactual Sentences," Journal of Philosophy, Vol. XLVI (September 1, 1949), pp. 573-591.</page><page sequence="6">522 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY From the formal standpoint, the questions just raised may be regarded as questions of uniqueness and invariance. There are, in fact, two such questions: (i) whether the smallest subsets deter- mining the atomic sentences are unique; and (ii) whether all exten- sionally equivalent complete sets of laws yield the same causal ordering of the atomic sentences." We have already obtained a negative answer to the second question, but before pursuing it further we wish to deal briefly with the first. a. It is easy to find an example of non-uniqueness of the smallest subset determining an atomic sentence. Consider a system com- prised of three atomic sentences, a, b, and c, and two laws, A a. b, and B -b. c. The set of laws (A, B) is a minimal complete set for the sentences (a, b, c); but both (A) and (B) are smallest sets determining b. To assure uniqueness of the causal ordering with respect to a set of empirical laws, we must insist that if there are two subsets, Si and Si', determining the same atomic sentence, at, then one of the subsets must be included in the other. A minimal complete set of empirical laws satisfying this requirement for all the atomic sentences will be called consistent. b. Reverting to the match-explosion example, we have seen that we arrive at "the lighted match causes the explosion" or "the explo- sion causes the lighted match" depending on whether we take (A, B) or (A', B') as the complete set of empirical laws. The first choice corresponds to everyday language, the second certainly does not. To see what is involved, let us reverse the question. What do we wish to convey when we say: "the lighted match caused the explosion" in addition to what we wish to convey by: "A lighted match was observed, and an explosion was observed"? It will be argued here that what we wish to convey by the first is precisely: "A . B", while what we wish to convey by the second is "a. b". But since the two statements are extensionally equivalent, what is meant by the distinction? One possible meaning is that in the first case we wish to indicate that realization of the state a. b is a selection of a particular state out of the whole set of states (a. b, -a. b, and-a. -b) that are realizable relative to B. In the second case we wish merely to denote realiza- tion of the state a. b without reference to a wider set of states. This is perhaps true, but certainly vague. In particular, the notion of the "selection" of a state from some set of "realizable" states might 11 The second question, re properties invariant over the group of extensionally equivalent laws, is discussed by Carnap, Logical Foundations of Probability (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1950), pp. 146-147.</page><page sequence="7">ON DEFINITION OF CAUSAL RELATION 523 be suspected of harboring objectionable metaphysics. In a deter- ministic world, only one state is realizable-that which is the fact. The natural laws are not relaxed from time to time to permit this act of selection.12 As Mach says: "The universe is not twice given, with an earth at rest and an earth in motion; but only once, with its relative motions, alone determinate. It is, accordingly, not per- mitted us to say how things would be if the earth did not rotate."''3 To deal with this apparent paradox, we shall have to complicate, slightly, the system of definitions outlined in Section 2. This we proceed to do next. 5. ELABORATION OF THE DEFINITION For the present purpose, we require an object language with a finite number of one-place predicates, aI( ), . . ., a.( ), in one-one relation with our original set of atomic sentences. We need an individual variable, t, which may be interpreted as the time, or more generally, the "location" of events. Then our new atomic sentences (observation-sentences) will be of the form: a,(t)-the sen- tence a, of our original language holds at "time" or "location" t. We now introduce a second set of predicates, A1( ), . . . Ak( ), also admitting the t's as their arguments, which we will refer to as condition-sentences or, more briefly, conditions. That is, Al (t,) means that the first condition holds at time ti. The A's, like the a's, are assumed to be empirical sentences, and the entire set of A's and a's, taken jointly, to be logically independent. In this language, a state-description for time t is constituted by a conjunction of atomic sentences in which each Ai(t) or its negation (but not both), and each as(t) or its negation (but not both), appear. We introduce the additional concept of a conditional state-description: a conjunction of atomic sentences in which each ai(t) or its negation (but not both) appears. The language is supposed to contain also a universal quantifier, so that we can construct sentences of the form: (t) ( ... ). We now define as an empirical law a quantified sentence of the form: (t) . A ,(t) :)f (al(t), a , a(t)), where f,( ... ) is a molecular sentence formed of the a's. We also define a conditional state-description as realizable relative to a set of laws if the conjunction f, ... fk, of the f's appearing in the set of 12 Hence, it is not a satisfactory answer to limit causal notions to experi- mental situations, since the behavior of the experimenter is presumably also governed by law. 13 Ernst Mach, The Science of Mechanics (La Salle, Ill.: Open Court, 1941), p. 284.</page><page sequence="8">524 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY laws, does not imply the falsity of the conditional state-description. It is important to note that in the present language, a sentence of the form (t) A ,(t) Dfi is an empirical sentence, while in the original language, sentences of the form A _f(a, b) were definitional, and hence tautologous. We will say that a set of conditions (and a corresponding set of laws) determines an atomic sentence, ay, if (i) we have an empirical law for each condition in the set, and (ii) in the set of states for which all these conditions are T, aj is either always T or always F. We define a complete set of laws as one that determines a unique con- ditional state-description-i.e., determines all the a's. Given a complete set of laws, we will say that aj has causal precedence over ai if the minimal set of laws determining the former is a proper subset of the minimal set of laws determining the latter. (For uniqueness, we must again impose a consistency requirement on the set of laws.) In our present formulation, there is no difficulty in speaking of the realizability of states. For if the A's are not invariant with respect to time, but if at any given time we have a sufficient number of A's holding to provide a complete system of laws, then at each t, a particular conditional state will be T, but at different times dif- ferent conditional states will be T. We can guarantee that the proper number of conditions will be T at any time by the following device: corresponding to each condition, Ak, we will postulate a whole family of "related" conditions, Ak, Bk, Ck, . . . such that one and only one is T at any given t.'4 Now we construct a set of laws by selecting a law corresponding to one (and only one) condition in each such family. We require that every such set be consistent and complete. Our system may seem rather special in that it does not admit any law~s that relate atomic sentences for two different points in time. This is easily remedied. It is not necessary that a sentence of the form a(t) denote an event occurring at time t, but only that it denote an event referred to time t. Thus, the sentence a(t) might mean that a particular body had a particular position two seconds before t. In this way all the laws of dynamics that are invariant with respect to translations of the origin of time can be accommodated. 6. THE PROBLEM OF INVARIANCE RE-EXAMINED In our first language we were confronted with the problem that the causal ordering was, in general, non-unique because we could 14 This notion is analogous to Carnap's "family of related properties" (Logical Foundations of Probability, pp. 76-77).</page><page sequence="9">ON DEFINITION OF CAUSAL RELATION 525 always find a number of minimal complete sets of laws extensionally equivalent to any given minimal complete set but inducing different causal orderings among the atomic sentences. But in our second language, two minimal complete sets of laws determining the same conditional state will not, in general, be extensionally equivalent. To illustrate this, let us elaborate the match-explosion example. As A l(t) we take the sentence: "A match is struck at time t, it is dry, there is oxygen present, etc." As A2(t), we take: "A space is filled at time t with an explosive mixture of gases." Here "explo- sive" must be supposed to be defined by the chemical composition of the gases. As al(t) we take: "A lighted match is in the space an instant after t"; and as a2(t): "An explosion occurs in the space an instant after t." We postulate empirical laws corresponding to the two conditions: A l(t) :) al(t); A 2(t) :&gt; . al(t) = a2(t). The two conditions, together with the two observation-sentences, define 24 =16 logically possible states. Only the nine states listed in the following truth-table are realizable relative to the laws. (If both conditions are T, then only the conditional state aj. a2 is realizable; if the first condition is T, the second F, two states are realizable; if the first condition is F, the second T, two states are realizable; and if both conditions are F, four states are realizable.) AI(t) A2(t) ai(t) a2(t) T T T T T F T T T F T F F T T T F T F F F F T T F F T F F F F T F F F F Now consider an alternative set of laws: Al(t) v . al(t)&lt;-a2 (t); A2 (t) : a2(t). Can we distinguish empirically between the new set of laws and the original set? Again, if both conditions are T, then only the condi- tional state a,. a2 is realizable. But if one or both of the conditions is F, the states that are realizable are not the same as before. This</page><page sequence="10">526 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY is exhibited by a truth-table that shows which states are realizable if the new laws are empirically valid. A I (t) A2(t) al(t) a2(t) T T T T T F T T T F F F F T T T F T F T F F T T F F T F F F F T F F F F If, for example, we can find a t such that A1. -A2. a1. -a2, then we know that the second set of laws is not valid. It is possible, of course, that the first set of laws is not valid either, but the point remains that the two sets of laws are not extensionally equivalent. We see that the empirical testability of laws (and the empirical significance of causal ordering) is intimately connected with the contingent character of laws, and with the fact that the conditions that constitute antecedents of laws are not T at all times.'5 Herein lies the rationale of experimentation-it is a procedure for system- atically varying the conditions that hold, and hence for producing observations of situations in which not all the conditions in a com- plete set of laws hold simultaneously. The observations permit an empirical choice to be made between two complete sets of laws that determine the same state. The experiments may, of course, be performed by nature. Re- verting to the match-explosion example, nature may provide at various times and places examples of all the nine conditional states that are empirically realizable relative to the original laws, and no others. While this does not prove the validity of these laws, it serves to rule out many alternative explanations for the observation that at some t we have A,.A2.a,.a2. 7. OPERATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DEFINITION Have we succeeded in providing a satisfactory explication of the causal relation? The question is not one that can be answered 15 From this it may be seen that if our explication of the causal relation is acceptable, it provides a basis for a treatment of the counterfactual conditional.

The test is whether a relation of the kind we have defined holds in those cases where scientists speak of one observable as "causing" another. In the examples that have been given in this paper, the explication appears to be consistent with ordinary usage. Moreover, it appears to avoid at least one of the funda- mental objections (the reversal of the ordering through negation) that can be raised against earlier definitions. The reader will pre- sumably wish to test the definition further with examples of his own. One point deserves further examination. The determination of the causal ordering depends in a fundamental way upon the distinction made in the previous section between conditions and observation-sentences. From an empirical standpoint, both obser- vation-sentences and conditions are atomic sentences whose truth or falsehood depends on empirical evidence. We have not given any basis for classifying a particular atomic sentence as one or the other. If the classification is purely conventional, then the causal ordering is equally conventional. I have not arrived at an entirely satisfactory answer to this question of classification, but can make two sugges- tions that may provide a basis for further exploration. a. In experimental situations, certain atomic sentences may de- note behaviors of the experimenter. If we call these sentences "conditions," then the remaining sentences may be regarded as "observation-sentences" that are indirectly, but not directly, deter- mined by the behavior of the experimenter. While this procedure appears to agree very well with the use of "cause" in experimental situations, it rules out statements like "rain causes trees to grow in the Amazon basin." If we accept this limitation, then we admit that any extension of causal language to non-experimental situations is metaphor and anthropomorphism. b. In non-experimental situations, all we are given at the outset is the fact that of all the logically possible states, only some subset has been empirically realized. Let us make the further assumption that we are justified in regarding the realized states as the only ones that are realizable. (More precisely: let us formulate laws with respect to which only those states that have been realized are realizable.) In order to distinguish between conditions and observation-sen- tences, we must find some asymmetry among the different columns of the truth-table describing the realizable states. That is, columns belonging to atomic sentences that we wish to classify as conditions must be distinguishable, on the basis of intrinsic criteria, from col- umns belonging to observation-sentences. I propose the following criterion:</page><page sequence="12">528 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Given n atomic sentences, and given a truth-table displaying the states that are realizable, select any subset of k atomic sentences, designating the members of this subset by A1, ..., Ak, and the remaining atomic sentences by a1, . . ., am (m = n-k). Define a con- ditional state of the a's as before. Consider the subset S(B), of conditional states that are realizable when a particular subset, B, of the A's are T (and the remainder F). The set of A's will be called an admissible set of conditions if the sets S(B) satisfy the following requirements: (1) S(O) has 2n-k members (i.e., all con- ditional states are realizable when all the conditions are F); (2) S(B) has 2n-k-g members when B has g members; (3) S(B1VB2) =S(B2). S(B1), where B1 and B2 are any two subsets of conditions. The last two requirements mean that the conditional states that are realizable when both a set of conditions, B1, holds and a second set of conditions, B2, holds, are those which are realizable both when B1 alone holds and when B2 alone holds-the laws are in this sense "additive." Now an examination of the first truth-table for the match- explosion example shows that the sentences A1 and A2 constitute a set of admissible conditions, and, indeed, the unique set. It is not, unfortunately, the case that every such truth-table will possess a set of admissible conditions, or if such a set exists, that it will be unique. Perhaps some modification of the requirements would remedy these defects, or perhaps the causal ordering should be regarded as defined only in those instances where these rather restrictive requirements are satisfied.
