<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eric Wagner A Land's Allegiance: Functions and Representations of Landscape in Post-Colonial Theatres I think that it is at least empirically arguable that our daily life, our psychic experience, our cultural languages, are today dominated by categories of space rather than categories of time, as in the period of high modernism. -Frederic Jameson Must literature always lead us away from the physical world, never back to it? -Lawrence Buell When Lawrence Buell began to scrutinize critical responses to nature in The Environmental Imagination, he lamented that most criticism was dedicated to excluding the literal role and function of nature. The history of literary study, he wrote, "presents the spectacle of having identified representation of the natural environment as a major theme while marginalizing the literature devoted most specifically to it and reading the canonical books in ways that minimize their interest in representing the environment as such" (9). Such sentiments could not be echoed today. In the intervening fourteen years since that work's publication, ecocriticism has come into its own as a field of critical inquiry, bringing under its expansive wing such disparate disciplines as ecology, geography, history, sociology, and in case those heuristics missed something, cultural studies. Consequently, the way people Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 16.3 (Summer 2009) Advance Access publication July 28, 2009 doi: 10.1 093/isle/isp067 © The Author(s) 2009.

Rather, the casual jogger with a little bit of information glances at the overhanging branches of the gingko tree and wonders why a park's manager decided to put it in Seattle even though the species is originally from China, and perhaps more urgently, why it was planted directly over the running path so that its smelly fruit could be mashed underfoot. The acknowledgement that nature is as much a cultural construc- tion as human physical beauty is not a new one; it is fraught with the complexities of and competitions between multiple agendas. Internationally, land use has become one of the most contentious issues of the past few decades. Whether the controversy is old growth forestry practices in the Pacific Northwest or oil rights in Gabon, arguments over the environment and its proper usage have proven remarkably effective at whipping up activist fervor: for example, the Nature Conservancy begins a capital campaign to save "The Last Great Places." Agriculturalists look to the land as a source of nutritional sustenance, while the urban dweller sees it as a means of escape. Such behaviors demonstrate that humans, even in the throes of their separation from the environment, are tangled in the processes and development of the land. Kate Soper, in What is Nature ?, answers her own question as follows: Nature is "those material structures and processes that are independent of human activity (in the sense that they are not humanly created products) and whose forces and causal powers are the necessary condition of every human practice" (132). Further, according to Soper, "the term 'nature' refers to everything which is not human and distinguished from the work of humanity" (15). Here, she extends the separation of nature from human activity to include human work: humans cannot "build" nature. The distinction is critical, for while Soper has effectively excised every human influ- ence on nature, nature retains the capacity to exert itself on human activities and behavior. Soper's definition is predicated, obviously, on notions of otherness, but she points out that the division was usually employed for conceptual convenience. However, when a colonizing impulse was at work, people and land were often viewed as a single construct: One may say that it is only with the opening up of the New World and the development of colonialism in the sixteenth century that amazement gives way to more confident assumptions of superiority, rooted in the idea</page><page sequence="3">A Land's Allegiance 571 of the cultural "other" as a creature without soul or capacity for language. In other words, it is only as imperialism brings about a fuller and more direct contact with the mythologized 'other' that a clearer distinction gets drawn between those who are indeed men (not marvels, monstrosities, or freaks of nature), but sub-human by comparison with civilized humanity. (76) However, more recent scholarship has demonstrated that Soper's thesis- that humans cannot manufacture nature- is incomplete, if not entirely false. Beyond its use as a justification for oppression, the human/nature dichotomy has come under increasing question with the realization that humans' capacity to effect change in their local environments (and beyond) far exceeds seemingly small, intrusive acts, and further, that that which is construed as nature is as much an intellectual or philosophical construction as anything. While nature may be separate from a human sphere in that humans did not directly produce it (e.g. they cannot make "real" trees from synthetic processes, although biosynthetic engineering may have something to say about this before too long), it is directly intertwined with their experiences (people can plant trees in aesthetically pleasing patterns, even in places that those trees would not grow of their own accord). Examining the points of contact and departure between nature and human while automatically positioning the word at some distance from its partner is counterproductive. Better to use the word in concert with several synonyms than strike it from the rolls altogether. Examining these conflicting interpretations reveals the complicated two-step between the natural and the human. For example, one view holds that nature functions apart from human beings, e.g. there are physical processes, understood and articulated mathematically that would continue whether humans were present or not; or from another perspective, nature is an eminently human construction, a cultural response to, and construction of, a set of images and stimuli embodying prescribed characteristics. As a product of such conven- tions, nature becomes subject to a variety of conflicting interpret- ations, and the question of an incontrovertible definition, if such a thing exists, revolves around questions of value: What is nature worth, and in what forms? How can it be used? How should it be used? Beyond philosophical concerns, however, asking these questions in a theatrical or dramatic context raises a novel set of problems, and in effect necessitates a movement critically from the use of "nature" to that of "landscape." Although the two terms are often used</page><page sequence="4">572 isle interchangeably, their differences are marked. Landscape, with its geographical resonance, has compelling implications for postcolonial criticism, for what is a construction of cultural otherness if not a mapping of spaces? A landscape gives the nation a recognizable char- acter, and political exploitation of landscape in the construction of fervent national identities has a long and dubious history. In The Language of Landscape , Anne Spirn advocates a new critical vocabu- lary for the evaluation of landscapes. She argues that the use of the words "nature" and "environment" when talking about any human activity is disingenuous, if not intellectually dishonest. The former terms too easily exclude a human presence; "landscape" properly incorporates human agency into the notion of a place as a text. Concerning a dramatic text, Una Chaudhuri and Elinor Fuch's recent work is especially helpful. Chaudhuri begins by locating the origins of "landscape" in Dutch painting and a desire for accurate, if not overly idealistic, represen- tation of local spaces. The difference between nature and landscape, Chaudhuri asserts, is that landscape is "a way of seeing [. . .] an ideo- logically and psychologically revealing statement about our relation- ship to the world around us, to a way of not seeing, masking and occluding the unsavory truths about our relations to each other and the lands we supposedly share" (11). Seeing and evaluating land- scapes is thus effectively a participation in the everyday discourses of power, except that these discourses are no longer the exclusive pro- vince of battlefields or government buildings; rather, all spaces are now eligible for analysis in the vernacular of landscape. Theater, says Chaudhuri, is in the unique position among the textual arts to render landscape an "empirical reality," rather than verbal abstraction. In such cases, this dramatic naturalism itself becomes a type of hege- mony: while readers of a book are allowed to think or picture what- ever they would like as a response to a series of words, the dominance of vision and visual representation in the theater renders the audience members' capacity for individual interpretive recon- struction redundant. Furthermore, the use of landscapes encourages a dialogue with other suffixed -scapes: mindscapes, cityscapes, cul- turescapes, among others. To the political exigency of these -scapes, Chaudhuri inserts landscape as a space of "commodity, passive, inert, external to the observing self, able to be bought and sold at will" (21). The history of theatrical naturalism shows the potential for land- scape's impact on the postcolonial consciousness. In his series of well- known articles, Raymond Williams outlines naturalism's overlying tenets, arguing for three forms. First, in its most basic interpretation,</page><page sequence="5">A Land's Allegiance 573 naturalism is a method of "accurate or lifelike reproduction" (Williams 203). Secondly, in its historically earliest meaning, it is the philosophical position closely allied to science, natural history, or materialism, which resulted in a reordering of sensory priorities to the visual (which in turn ushered in the dominance of landscape). Finally, in the definition most relevant to drama, it is the "movement in which the method of accurate production and specific philosophi- cal position are organically and consciously fused" (204). That is, stagecraft not only aims to be recognizable as "real life," but also strives to show, through codified and repeated representations, how social conditions affect human behavior: Dramatic naturalism in the third sense can never be so reduced [to simple physical considerations such as set design], since it does not reproduce a physical feature or environment because it is technically available or interesting, but because such features and environments are integral parts of the dramatic action, indeed, are themselves actors and agencies. (205) Williams and Fuchs agree that the shift in landscape from backdrop to character occurred in the drama of the nineteenth century. The development resulted in a new type of "spatial legibility," in which the landscape was symbolically significant, rife with "historical, spatial, socioeconomic, and cultural meanings" (Fuchs 37). By impli- cation, geography, both political and social (since social conditions are incontrovertibly tied to place), is of paramount importance when considering character development and interiority. As Mark Poster has argued, in the contemporary world of increased information traffic and the Internet, the prevailing question regarding subjectivity has changed from "who am I" to "where am I." Formerly in books and art, long journeys from one's homeland were meant to aid the formation of a stable subject- a person leaves the influences of family to find out who he or she really is in an extended character- building endeavor detached from both familial and landed roots. Now, such uprootings are decidedly negative events, producing floods of refugees, political exiles, and illegal aliens. Consequently, the space a person occupies now has as much impact in the construc- tion of a national identity as it does in a personal one, even as the gap between those two identities continues to shrink. Concerns of landscape and the dynamics of its usage, of the usage of physical space, therefore, are unshakably tied to concerns of national identity. In light of these questions, the contested terrains of postcolonial dramas and the means by which such landscapes are used, either for</page><page sequence="6">574 isle enacting colonial agendas or resisting them, make for useful study. By "landscapes," I mean two things: the physical place on which the conflict between colonizer and colonized is enacted; and the represen- tation of that land, or how those representations, the psychophysical topographies, are exploited by campaigns both politico-cultural and artistic. The first definition is the most obvious: the colonizer's overt means of conquering a nation or culture is to occupy its land phys- ically. Usually this means marching troops in, overthrowing whatever system of government was in place, taking over the production of resources so as to control their distribution, and reeducating the populace in such a way as to make the complete abrogation of their former way of life a positive step forward. (Buell notes that it is under the rubric of environmental and technological development that "progress," which technically means "movement," has become equated with "improvement" [3].) These practices (and others much more abhorrent that I've left out) equate to an appropriation of space. In such a scenario, the prevailing land ethic typically shifts towards a predominantly Western European one of resource production or extraction, with its emphasis on swift conversion of natural capital into profit, with little or no interest in sustainability, and even less regard for the financial remuneration of local inhabitants. In essence, nature becomes separated from culture as the colonizer dissociates the colonized from both formerly practiced land ethics and resource bases. The far-reaching effects of this cannot be overstated. However, while postcolonial theorists have paid a great deal of attention to the significance of occupied space , they have not looked as closely at the representation and production of occupied landscapes. The debate in the first definition could be framed, then, in terms of landscape and commerce. The greatest threat to the dominance of indigenous culture is temporal: as the colonizers control the land for longer and longer periods, the acclimated legitimacy of their rule becomes less and less questioned as self-interested parties within a culture begin, perhaps in fits of pragmatic calculus, to look to maxi- mize their own material well-being. An example of this is seen in Bruce Braun's paper, "Buried Epistemologies: The Politics of Nature in (Post)colonial British Columbia." A geographer, Braun examines the conflict between a large, multi-national timber corporation and indi- genous peoples surrounding forest use in British Columbia. Central to Braun's work is the idea that "'nature' (wilderness) has been con- structed as a realm separate from 'culture'" (3). The question is whether this separation is acknowledged throughout the culture or simply by the power brokers, in this case the timber corporation with its pri- vileged access to government land and government decision-makers.</page><page sequence="7">A Land's Allegiance 575 If the former, then the debate that Braun investigates centers on resource use. If the latter, then the efforts of MacMillan-Bloedel, the timber corporation advocating its own stewardship, become much more problematic. As Braun points out, by calling itself the "custodian of the forest," MacMillan attempts to advance its agenda by relocating questions of policies and legitimization from the social to the technical realm. In doing so, he argues, they effectively silence the indigenous voice in the debate. Restricting the acceptable terms of use to those of economics and technicalities, such as tree farming, turns the question of representation of land into a "technical ration- ality as a surrogate for moral and political rationalities" (9). Nature becomes bounded in a successional pattern of harvest, preparation, restoration, management, and harvest. What the timber corporation does is ignore the native tribes' assertions that what appears to be "wilderness" within one cohort is easily seen as "culture" in the next. Successfully re-inscribing the natural as a public resource, while pur- portedly supporting a number of views, in effect suppresses dialogue more than it encourages, much less accommodates, it. In the context of postcolonial drama, The Hungry Earth by South African playwright Maishe Maponya exhibits the same dynamics of the above debate. The play examines the effects of South African migrant labor practices and their relationship with both the gold- and diamond-mining industries that propelled South Africa's economy, critiquing the dehumanization of the black work force and the many facets of state-sanctioned racial oppression. First performed in 1978, it prompted a firestorm of criticism from the South African apartheid government, which had expressly banned political theater for fear it would incite civil unrest. No wonder: the postcolonial dramatic land- scape, according to Edward Ziter, is deeply implicated as a locus of physically translating "thé representation of geographic context into three-dimensional stage environments [. . .] domesticated regions long associated with excess and transgression while simultaneously transforming a dizzying quantity of new geographic information into a coherent theatrical landscape" (189-90). As presented in the play, the appropriation of the South Africans' semiotic capabilities enabled the Boers in South Africa to suppress black South Africans without actually being present. The duration of their rule, and the complete- ness of their redefinition of proper land use, facilitated the conversion of a cultural resource to a productive one so effectively that the trope of resistance also became one of production and exploitation. For Koku Amuzu, landscape in modernist African fictions is "mostly one of defeat, frustration, despair, and alienation" (77). While landscape in The Hungry Earth is all of the above terms, to this</page><page sequence="8">576 isle list one might add malignant hostility: it is landscape's direct inter- vention and action, rather than its passive presence, which has the most pronounced effect on the play's action. Although the play is ultimately about the cultural, physical, and social environments in which extensive abuses occurred, early performances were notable for their spare scenery; only essential props were used, and these lay piled on the stage when not needed. Whatever may be said of the textual, semiotic landscape, what the audience first saw was notable for its distinctively deconstructed, almost casual nature. As Helen Gilbert notes, "This emphasis on a non-naturalistic performance not only is driven by economics, but also underlies the play's demand for political transparency in South Africa" (12). While such practices would at first seem to de-emphasize the importance of landscape, given its traditional dependence on naturalistic representation, the opposite is in fact true. Gilbert argues that the play's "emphasis on environment- physical, social and political- takes on a symbolic meaning through the play's repeated anthropomorphism" (13). Abstractly presented or not, the landscape's presence in the play is of tantamount importance. This is because the land in The Hungry Earth acts as relief to the action throughout the play. The allegorical stature of the characters- Usivoko [Shield], Matlhoko [Sufferings], Sethotho [Imbecile] - indicates that landscape should not be seen merely as the backdrop on which the action takes place, but as something of a character in its own right. Rather than portraying the land as having a fixed identity throughout the play, Maponya gives it a mirror-like quality- it rep- resents a particular character's prejudices, depending on the context in which those desires are acted out. As opposed to Louis Nowra (to whom I'll refer later), whose landscapes are more or less impassive to the action played upon them, Maponya's are called to action by the playwright, if not by the characters themselves. The trajectory of the many songs sung in the play shows the semiotic value of the land to the black South Africans, and the effects of that sign's appropriation by colonialists. The performance, as opposed to the dramatic action, begins with a prologue's prologue on a blacked-out stage, sung by the entire company: "Wake up Mother Afrika / Wake up / Time has run out / And all opportunity is wasted" (16). Of note is the spelling of Afrika with a "k." The song ends with a warning: "Wake up / Before the white man rapes you" (16). Outside of the performance space, the text constructs an image of a continent that is a maternal, feminized landmass, emerging from darkness. By noting, "opportunity is wasted," however, the text also introduces the trope of production (which could additionally be read</page><page sequence="9">A Land's Allegiance 577 as fertility), itself the reason that the white man is in South Africa to begin with. The conflict between the native South Africans and the Boers becomes a struggle over valued natural resources and the dis- tribution of that value, instead of only occupation and cultural hege- mony. Rape moves from an act of penetration to one of forced capital extraction, but this shift is emphasized as such by necessity: the South Africans would be implicated in the rape of Mother Afrika if penetration were the only criterion, because they too are excavating the mines, albeit under duress. (And even so, the resistance to forced labor is apparently not a campaign to stop the mining, but one to redistribute more equitably the profits from it.) Furthermore, the pro- logue's song raises questions about the relationship that the charac- ters have with the landscape, and whether or not this space is separate from an "Afrikán" construct. The troupe proclaims they will resist "[d]ying in the stubborn, hungry earth" (16). It becomes clear that the earth, or land, or whatever it is they are standing on is an entity distinct from the "Mother Afrika" and all its cultural freight invoked at the play's beginning. This distinction has troubling implications for the rest of the action because it shows that unconsciously or not, the South Africans have divorced the idea of their homeland, and a unifying notion of culture, from the land that they actually, physically inhabit. If, as Spirn asserts, landscape is an eminently human construction, then Maponya's characters wish to escape the bounded/bonded landscape and inhabit an Utopian, pre-colonial space, a space that would not exist even if they succeeded in driving all the colonists away. The ramifications of the disjunction build in the first scene, when Matlhoko laments, "When this land started giving birth to ugly days, things started going wrong from the moment of dawning and peace went into exile, to become a thing in the wilderness. Yes, we experi- enced the saddest days of our lives when umlungu first came to these shores called Africa, a total stranger from Europe" (17). It is the land itself that is birthing the South Africans' current troubles, not the Europeans or the apartheid government. The fertility of the land- scape alluded to in the opening song brings nothing but pain, and is consequently estranged from any strategy of recovery; the black South Africans may salvage their cultural identity, but not through a new negotiation of their relationship with the landscape. Add to this the linguistic slip that has already begun to appear for the South Africans, as they begin thinking of their homeland as Africa, a name given by umlungu, as opposed to the "Mother Afrika" from the pre- prologue song of resolution. Locating their culture in an unlanded space, and making it an ephemeral construction, or text, the South</page><page sequence="10">578 isle Africans invite the possibility of interpretation (and penetration) from an outside reader, in this case the Boers. By omitting a more umbilical link, to extend the maternal metaphor from Mother Afrika, one that imbues significance to the landscape outside of its capacity to spit out material wealth, an ethic of extractive land use and resource con- version is more easily stolen out from under them. The landscape is rendered alien and malevolent, instead of nurturing, or, at the very least, neutral. This new imagining of the landscape is most clear and poignant in Scene Four, the scene most closely linked to the landscape. While the other scenes are located in areas of human construction- compounds or trains- this scene takes place at a mine. It is here that the significance of "the hungry earth" is made fully clear, refigured from the vaguely ominous imagery of the opening to a directly inter- ventionist, lethal construct. The scene opens with Matlhoko and Beshwana speaking before their descent to the mines: Beshwana: The gods are angry. Matlhoko: Yes, but their anger can't go beneath this earth. It is quiet there. (20) The land is an unaffiliated space in which the workers can flee from the anger of their own deities. However, this designation of landscape as sanctuary is short-lived. The poignancy of the scene comes in the next encounter between the workers and their supervisors, in which the supervisors order holes to be drilled in certain spots. The workers object, arguing that sites are unsuitable, but their objections are over- ridden. When the mine explodes and collapses, burying many miners, the survivors confront the landscape's lethality in a variety of ways: Sethotho, the colonial apologist/sympathizer, races past his dead and dying colleagues to save himself; Matlhoko reflects, "I looked back into the tunnel where my brothers were being eaten by this hungry earth. I cursed the white man and questioned the very existence of God, for it was my sweat and bones and blood that made Egoli what is it today" (21). The gods of the early encounter have colluded, in a sense, with the God of Western European Christian orthodoxy, a product of missionary teachings that have themselves invaded the African continent. The semiotic settling of the linguistic conflict is complete by Scene Five at the compound. There, Usiviko and Beshwana near the point of blows, but when they see the oncoming tour bus, they immedi- ately calm down and fawn for the camera: "Hi! Hello, beautiful tour- ists, welcome to sunny South Africa!" (23). The South Africans have</page><page sequence="11">A Land's Allegiance 579 internalized the Boer pressures of the Afrika/ Africa dichotomy: Afrika may be home to the frustrated ire of repressed citizens, but Africa is a place of harmony and, more importantly, tourist dollars. An important consideration during performance, it would seem, would be how to have the players pronounce the various Afrik/cas throughout the play. If there is no difference, the subtlety with which the Boers appropriate the nation is highlighted: the audience will not hear the elision of the two- Africa and Afrika- but the South Africans presumably internalize it and are more closely attuned to its significance, even in a play notable for its de-emphasized interiority. The representational game continues through the scene, as the two run through a list of socialist luminaries before ending on the black bus driver who looks like "Shame" (23). What shame is exactly is not entirely clear: either the shame of working in such a low position or the shame of driving umlungu around with his/her cameras. However, umlungu is in an important sense not even present anymore, but rather has left an "army behind to take care of the unruly elements" (17). Sethotho, who has his own definite ideas about landscape and nature, particularly before umlungu arrived, represents the dissention cultivated by umlungu, and the confusion born of the desire to rid the land of him while also enjoying his more civilizing influences (at least, as Sethotho identifies them). Sethotho's philosophy is that of the colonizers: Before he came you were savages swinging onto trees and eating bananas. You deserted your culture and allowed the hides and wood to rot in the fields. Umlungu taught you how to make leather and how to make furniture. Today you can even make money. You lived like wild animals; now you live like human beings. But no, you ungrateful creatures, you are not satisfied with the things you got from umlungu. Does it surprise you that he has run away? (17) First, Sethotho compares his compatriots to monkeys, and claims that they have "deserted their culture." What he means by "culture" is unclear. What he implies, though, is that, as voiced in the prologue song, the South Africans are not exploiting natural resources to the fullest extent possible, and, consequently, they are somehow a back- ward, under-evolved species. Western categories of construction are equated with advanced culture (furniture and so forth). Subtly, this advance shifts towards the massing of capital (in contrast with the Marxist thinkers who will be cited in Scene Five). Sethotho invokes the idea of wilderness, or unused land, as a means of splitting</page><page sequence="12">580 ISLE landscape from the pre-colonized culture. He associates traditional nineteenth-century European images of wilderness- wild animals running free, chaos, rottenness- with the non- Western African land- scapes. Undeveloped is equated with misuse, and Sethotho brings his criticism full circle by defining wilderness, condemning it, and by extension condemning the culture living within it. However, Usiviko negates the criticism when he notes that it is not a lack of production, but the appropriation of production that is the source of the South Africans' anger: "You underpaid us and celebrated when we were starving. You gave us mirrors and knives in exchange for cattle. You never set foot on those vast tracts of land that are still in their virgin state. You did not want to get to them because you had no slaves to do the sweating for you" (17-18). The payment privilege introduced by Sethotho is turned on its head; the virgin land is not exalted, but is not fundamentally destabilized either. But Usivoko's criticism is still voiced with capitalist goals in mind. Lack of obvious, marring land use is still seen as misused, wasted potential. Fertility and repro- duction are only worth fighting over if they are utilized in the pro- duction of capital and/or profit. The South African becomes not only a slave, but also a surrogate on his/her own land, a progenitor of a child not his. In essence, he is cuckolded by umlungu. This conflation of land and sexuality /sexual reproduction is emphasized throughout the play, but nowhere more so than with the appearance of the Woman in the last scene. I will think of her as representing the Mother Afrika evoked from the play's beginning. Of note is that Maponya keeps her anonymous: even after she states her name she is still denoted in the text as Woman. Her anonymity emphasizes the expanse of her metaphorical Otherness and archety- pal significance. She tells of Utopian visions fueled by dreams of capital, and of the reality of abandonment upon arrival, of colonial promises gone awry. This reflects the instance in the first scene where the four main characters retell their wooing by the missionaries, who pour good Christian lessons advocating passivity into their ears. Particularly chilling, however, is the last section of the Woman's soli- loquy: "Today I manage to live and feed my two fatherless children out of the beers and indambola I sell. And when the beers don't sell I become every man's woman. What else can I do? I can't get permits to work here" (23). Mother Afrika, seen here, is not being raped, but is forced to sell herself to live. The audience, likewise, is forced to confront the result of asking a metaphorical construct, land-as- woman, to be everything to everyone. At the end of the play, when she finds out that her husband is dead (a focusing, identifying morsel of information for an anonymous character), Woman laments that the</page><page sequence="13">A Land's Allegiance 581 hungry earth has swallowed her man, and the play ends with the anguished cry that the hungry earth has swallowed "all our men" (24). The vehicles of capitalism, the South African's self-styled means of escaping poverty and oppression, have been swallowed, either by colonizers or by the earth itself. Moreover, the dichotomy between Mother Afrika and the hungry earth is fully realized -they are defini- tively not one and the same, but are directly antagonistic. Where, then, could the South Africans be said to live? The play's framing of this debate, far from providing an answer, allows it and surrounding questions to be defined by the colonizer to the South Africans' extreme detriment. The second use of landscape, as demonstrated by Australian Lowis Nowra's Inside the Island , is in some ways more conventionally troublesome. Here, one encounters the dangers of edenie narratives (even those not necessarily valorizing wilderness per se), and the risks of mythologizing the pristine. In this context, I am more inter- ested in the idea of landscape as a palimpsest, a marked-up history of its own history. In this view, what has been written on a landscape is never fully erased, but rather is written over in a process of narra- tive stratification. Some of these narratives are sympathetic to one another, at ease with their shared source and, although necessarily varied due to the wear and tear of cultural development, proceed towards roughly similar aesthetic objectives. But some do not, rather are contradictory, oppositional, even aggressive, in conflict over the same space. The gap in hegemony between these conflicting narra- tives dictates the extent to which they are aware of each other. That is, when one narrative has been forcibly inscribed over its predecessor in an act of literary violence, do its purveyors feel at all obligated to acknowledge the presence of the former tenants of the aesthetic space? More than likely, the answer is no; doing so would acknowl- edge the presence and legitimacy of the former occupant, and the colonizer's claim to power depends on the outright denial of any other claim. That is not to argue, however, that former narratives have no effect on these newest additions. Indeed, when colonialist powers profess to be benign visitors (as most do), their new narra- tives, in the form of revisionist history, must often strive hard, with a certain studied indifference, to occlude any former narratives, profes- sing shock at the absence of a dissenting voice or presence. The absence is further used as proof of complicit acceptance. Of particular interest in the context of landscape is when land-use practices are used as means of erasure, or the eradication of a guilty conscience. As Homi Bhabha writes in "Locations of Culture," "What is theoreti- cally innovative and politically crucial is the need to think beyond</page><page sequence="14">582 isle narratives of originary and initial subjectivities and to focus on those moments or processes that are produced in the articulation of cultural differences" (1332). Louis Nowra's Inside the Island provides a tableau through which to investigate the relationship between a landscape, cultures-in-flux, and related histories. First performed in Australia in 1980, the play received a mixed critical response for as much political as artistic reasons. Reviewers initially condemned the work as "un-Australian," which suggests, according to Helen Gilbert, "the longevity of the nationalist myths that Nowra [aimed] to dismantle" (287). That he would be attacked for doing so was ironic, given that, prior to this play's production, Nowra had often been accused of being too "inter- nationalist" a playwright, lacking any interest in local issues. In his play, which follows an early twentieth-century colonial family in a farming district in New South Wales, landscape is a cul- tural presence on which various peoples' histories have been enacted. When Lillian Dawson and her clan arrive, however, they attempt to rewrite the formerly dominant narratives in vernaculars sympathetic to their own colonialist enterprise. Their failure to acknowledge the primacy, much less the legitimacy, of previous claims on the land- scape is ultimately what leads to the apocalyptic cataclysm and tragedy at the end of the play. The landscape and its relation to culture and history in Inside the Island differ markedly from that of The Hungry Earth. The most obvious difference between the two is the position of the authors relative to the dominant cultures their plays, respectively, critique: Maponya, a black South African, writes from within the colonized community, while Nowra, of European descent, writes of the English as an ostensible member of that group. In Nowra's play, the land- scape is not used so much actively to suppress indigenous popu- lations, but as a seemingly inert construct free of such affiliations. In essence, the philosophies of the respective dramatists regarding land are paradoxically different. Where Maponya's earth consumes its children and has an impassive power, Nowra's landscapes are full of sinister, lurking presences. For him, the landscape is not an overt player in his play, but a presence that informs the audience of a par- ticular character's position within the drama. Additionally, as Helen Gilbert notes, the landscape can be seen as a character in its own right. More importantly, though, Nowra's use of the landscape high- lights the biases of the protagonists, Lillian and George Dawson. The most obvious example of amnesia regarding a landscape's history is Lillian Dawson, the matriarch and de facto ruler of her little corner of the Outback. Her attitudes towards the environment are</page><page sequence="15">A Land's Allegiance 583 made clear in her first appearance when, as relayed to Captain Henry, she recalls her family's history with their homestead: "My father built it forty years ago. He was a great man. When he first came here it was just bush- a huge plain of Aboriginals and gum trees. He got rid of the blacks, except for those whom he converted; removed the gum trees" (292). For Lillian, the history of the place begins forty years ago with their arrival; prior to that, it was just "Aboriginals and gum trees." Even with her disdain, however, she notes the link between the indigenous people and their land, but the association emphatically dehumanizes the former inhabitants. Furthermore, she associates such a relationship between Aboriginals and land with wildness (again, chaos), which is negated simply through her family's colonizing presence. Her fear of isolation along with her categorization of open land as loneliness, reflects a funda- mental disharmony she experiences on a landscape not her own. As she says to Captain Henry, "I worry, perhaps unnecessarily, but everything seems exaggerated out here: the loneliness, the isolation" (293). Australia is "a giant sloth," with "eight-hundred million Asiatics eying us with envy" (293). Lillian prefers her nature mani- cured and contained, inviting Captain Henry to see her indoor garden with its district-famous fuchsias. Not only are these fuchsias an exotic species, they further illustrate Lillian's adeptness in cultivat- ing spaces, regardless of the fictions she must use to construct them. Lillian's affiliation with construction extends both to land distribution and, most notably, to history. Throughout the play, history is a remarkably malleable construction, something that white characters can erase at will or restructure to corroborate their narra- tives of themselves. When Lillian asks the captain and sergeant to sign her autograph book, she is horrified to discover that the illiterate sergeant has signed only an X: "The page will have to be torn out. Perhaps I can use some sort of erasure," she says, in an effort to maintain her desired image of civilized, literate superiority (295). This episode prefigures her blasé recounting of the land's history at the cricket match: My father was a great lover of cricket. He built this ground years ago. It used to be an Aboriginals' camp before that. My father clothed them, then one day they just disappeared. Went walkabout. One of the lubras used to sing hymns under my window on a Sunday morning. I was their favorite. 'You're so white, so white,' she'd say and gasp over my soft skin and how white it was, as if examining fine silk. (306)</page><page sequence="16">584 isle The Aborigines, save for those converted by the redeeming qualities of Christianity, are unapologetically eradicated and forgotten. Moreover, those who do remain are little more than a curiosity for Lillian, who blithely reinterprets their fascination with her white skin as approval of her presence. A close reading of the poem that she recites to the soldiers, entitled, "Pure at Heart," shows the extent of her antipathy towards Aboriginals and what they represent: "Their hearts are full of darkness and guile," eyeing the virtuous colonizers with hate (306). No wonder they had to be booted from the land. When Captain Henry and his men hear her recitation, they are unsure how to respond, at first clapping before she has finished. For Lillian, land is something that can be easily demarcated and parceled out by whatever whims the colonizer feels. Her father gives land, which apparently he has built himself, to the government as a "mag- nanimous gesture," and nothing more is thought of it. However, her reading is fabricated and corrupt. The poem, which she claims was anthologized in Seasons of Peace and War , is actually her own compo- sition. Her lie about the anthology, attributed to modesty, is an effort to have her views inscribed within and officially sanctioned by the broader cultural machinery- only good poems are anthologized, after all- and thus accepted as popular orthodoxy. Such fictionalized revisions anticipate her lie at the end of the play, when she tells the captain that her husband George (another potentially dissenting voice now conveniently erased) ordered the contaminated wheat to be fed to the soldiers. Whereas Lillian and her amnesia are relatively straightforward, if menacing, George Dawson is placed in a more complicated position as a character. A white man born in Australia, he cannot find ethnic solace with either the Aborigines, whose land he currently occupies, or the colonizing British, as Lillian does. He lives in a home-less space as something of a non-entity, despite all his efforts. He is, to use Bhabha's term, "unhomed": "To be unhomed is not to be home- less, nor can the 'unhomely' be easily accommodated in that familiar division of social life into private and public spheres. The unhomely moment creeps up on you stealthily as your own shadow" (1337). In Inside the Island , George's process of "unhoming" becomes a central feature of the play. The audience is made aware rather quickly of his unstable tenure, but it is George's own realization of his position that is most crushing. His unhomeness stems from his alienation from the landscape and his unfamiliarity with the processes in which he plays a role. Nowra shows George Dawson's relationship with the land- scape quickly during the play's exposition. Walking home drunk in Act I, George trips over a tree root, falls into a creek, and is stuck.</page><page sequence="17">A Land's Allegiance 585 Peter Blackwood, the play's deracinated element who resists alle- giance or encapsulation of any sort, rescues him. When it comes to affecting his surroundings, George is remarkably powerless. He is at first terrified by the disembodied voice of Peter, emanating from the blackness just beyond his grasp. The landscape toys with George in its disregard for his subjectivity. His general futility is further high- lighted in his first conversation with Peter, during which he claims ownership of the land on which Peter lives, even though he knows nothing about it: Peter: I live here. George: Here? Peter: Just over there in that bunch of trees. George: But this is my land. Peter: The creek too? George: I own as far as you can see. Nearly up to those hills. All the flat land around here and the wheat fields are mine. So's the mill. Everything. (291) Later in the scene, George claims, "No one comes here. No one" (291). His ownership is predicated on absence- absence of Aborigines, primarily- and consequently Peter's presence calls his legitimacy into question. (Indeed, George's very claims of ownership are suspect, in some ways as fictional or deluded as many of Lillian's: George owns the land only because he married Lillian; prior to that, everything was hers. George himself says as much when lamenting his abjectness to his daughter, Susan: "When I married your mother I had nothing, all this was hers" [307].) His response is to offer Peter work, to attempt to enclose this free radical into the confines of a thinly veiled master- slave productive relationship. This is how George "helps" people: he takes them from whatever lifestyle they had formerly and relocates them within a capitalist matrix in which he is, at least nom- inally, boss. When Peter resists this initial gambit, George blithely says that he will have to tear down Peter's hut, which will obligate him to live with the other workers. (Later, in Act II, George threatens to withhold Peter's wages unless he plays his squeezebox for the sol- diers at the cricket match.) But in their first meeting the only landed feature George finds worth mentioning is "his" mill, or that which represents the conversion of a natural resource into product; Peter, on the other hand, can at least see the trees around him. George's desires regarding landscape are more complicated than mere ownership, however, as is shown in Act II. Here, George wist- fully relays to Captain Henry his criteria for serenity: "The snow</page><page sequence="18">586 isle country, that's the place to live. Near the Victorian border. White snow everywhere. A sea of snow covering everything. Now that's serene. Serenity . . . What I wouldn't give for serenity and quietness. Complete silence, except for music, wouldn't that be grand? You can express your soul through music- without words. I believe that" (308). We now begin to understand the complexities of George's desiring. In contrast to his wife, who sees little use for land without some form of production or extraction in progress, George can envi- sion a pristine landscape capable of giving him an increasingly elusive peace of mind. Granted, his fantastic tableau is not without human trappings (music), but absent are the fantasies of control or coercion that typically mark his interactions with the immediate environment. Whereas Lillian's whiteness is immediately associated with the violent suppression of blackness (witness her poem), George's is more ahistorical: for him, the most desirable state is one without people. This scene highlights the enigmatic relationship that George has with landscape and memory. Ostensibly, he plays the role of overseer/owner: the land is his, no questions asked. However, the land is not his, in that he is still subject to the stochastic catastrophes associated with walking on it, and denied the pleasures he associates with living in it. The things George most desires- Susan and serenity- reject and tease him from just out of reach. Susan's disdain is especially galling, as she is one half his genetic legacy, but completely in the thrall of her mother. She scorns Australia and can hardly wait to visit England, which Lillian lauds as being "green, green, green. Everything so green it hurt my eyes" (294). But in the final fire, he loses them both. Suddenly confronted with this unequivocal loss, his elusive image of serenity is transformed into a vindictive rage. Unable to cleave to the land of his birth or negotiate a sympathetic reception for his progeny (herself killed by the soldiers), he wills its destruction. It is an empty gesture, however, because only he dies as a result. The land, as it always has, continues, having absorbed George's story along with all the others. But for Lillian, the conflagration of the final act brings her cor- roded land ethic into sharp relief, and forces her to confront the prejudices she has harbored about land and its erased presences. The stage for Lillian's downfall is set when she decides to send the older flour to the soldiers for their cricket game, which is the culmination of her disregard for whatever primal rhythms Nowra implies exist in the landscape. Like her father with the land before, she gives the flour as a gift. This is the sort of history Lillian likes to acknowledge. She has converted the landscape and made it produce things for her, but without any attention to the dynamics of growth and season. She</page><page sequence="19">A Land's Allegiance 587 dismisses the significance of ecosystem processes, which she deems inconsequential in the face of her colonial authority. This leads to the contamination of wheat by a fungus stemming from improper storage. In response, Nowra gives the land the capacity to act, and it responds by appropriating the forces Lillian thought were for her protection- the soldiers- and turning them into agents of destruc- tion. Ergotism, the fungal infestation of the grain that causes delirium and hallucinations, is the cause. The hallucinations themselves show the sudden power of the landscape as Private Higgs plucks furiously at his chest: "Must get them. Pick them out. Red flowers. I want you to turn them out. Turn them out. I'm being attacked. Help me, I'm being attacked . . . They're all over me. Turn them out. I'm being attacked. Help me. They're digging deeper. The roots are all through me . . . You fuckin' idiot- I've got to get up the hill to see the top. All the corpses are coming down the hill, so I've got to get up" (311-12). The landscape is a site of historical memory, penetrating deep into the soldiers and horrifying them as it gives up its spectral dead, its former inhabitants. Lillian is suddenly forced to confront the chaos that has seethed beneath the surface since her arrival, beneath the cricket fields, beneath her mill. Those to whom she thought herself a beneficiary, such as Mrs. Harrison, are no longer supplicant tenants, but assertive. They resist her orders. The same could also be said for the land, which consumes everything with fire. As Lillian stares dumbly out, she is faced with specters of a past she has chosen to deny: "Those men . . . like ghosts" (311). The ellipses in this speech are telling, as they represent one of two times that Lillian cannot for- cefully articulate her views, the second coming half a moment later: "This is ... I can barely comprehend it all. Is the . . . what would you call it? . . . Is the madness a disease? Is it contagious?" (311). As a physical body, she endured her existence in Australia by closing her dermis- her border- to it and attempting to remain impregnable. Finding that no longer a possibility, and overwhelmed by the sudden loss of everything material she owned, she reverts to her amnesiac self, choosing to learn nothing from the affair. She rewrites her own history once more, falsely blaming her husband for the transport of the flour as she prepares to construct a new life for herself in beloved England. And lest the audience pass too quickly over the significance of this, Nowra allows Captain Henry a eulogy of sorts, as he tries to divine a meaning from the destruction around him: Captain: It occurred to me while watching my men. What was going on inside of them ... it would be a mistake to believe that what</page><page sequence="20">588 isle they experienced- the hallucinations, the horror- wasn't a part of them. What they saw . . . the things that went on in their heads . . . Can they ever see the world the same way they saw it before? Lillian: ( Throwing away an object she was examining) Useless. Sorry, what was that? Captain: Nothing. (319) In citing "the world," Captain Henry subtly advocates a more com- plete land ethic, one that is at least cognizant of the stories that have been acted out on it before. But Lillian is not listening. She ends the play saying, "We must forget all of this. It's too terrible. The strong forget, the weak remember" (319). For her, the pain of having an unwelcome history thrust into her face is too great. The landscape has lost its usefulness for her and is the repository only of bad memories. Works Cited Amuzu, Koku.
