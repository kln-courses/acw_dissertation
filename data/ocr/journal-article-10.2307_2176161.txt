In considering the more obvious cases of Imitation, we find that the process involves the throwing light upon an uncontrollable per- cept (the object imitated) by setting the controllable imitative act beside it. Other cases show that Imitation sets off our conscious- ness of the original by virtue of the very contrast that mingles with the similarity. It is plain, therefore, that we may expect to find imitations which, not only by accident but intentionally, represent one set of sense data in terms of activities that give us data belong- ing to another sense, or to any otherwise contrasted group of experi- ences. It is obvious that our thoughts are, in this general sense, conscious processes by which we constantly mean to imitate the truth of the things that we experience. Equally obvious is the fact that to think experience is to translate it into terms which are decid- edly foreign to its character, as it comes to us apart from such ideal reconstruction. It may be said that to go on in this fashion is in the end to include nearly all the psychical processes under this one term. It is possible, however, to distinguish Imitation from the other mental processes by defining it as follows: An imitation is a more or less conscious motor adjustment that tends to emphasize or interpret a series of relatively external experiences by furnishing from within the conscious counterpart of some one or more of the aspects of the first series - a counterpart which is both like and unlike the</page><page sequence="2">558 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IV. original, and whose contrast is therefore often as instructive as its similarity. Lower cases of imitative functions already show us the contrast, in the midst of similarity, between the imitative process and the sensory stimuli. Higher up, this contrast is itself made an object of consciousness. Imitation and model are contrasted series of presentations whose relation keeps them apart. Hence it is, psychologically speaking, that Imitation is the one source of our whole series of conscious distinctions between subject and object, thought and truth, deed and ideal, impulse and conscience, inner world and external world. The contrast between model and imita- tion is the first appearance in consciousness of that differentiation which, in the end, makes internal and external experience, not merely qualitatively different, but consciously discriminated.

The object of these experiments was not the discovery of new facts, but the further illustration of laws already known. Carefully selected words were given to various subjects and a record kept of the images called up. The following conclusions were reached. The mind cultivates whatever is most useful to it. One class of intellects thinks by means of signs, with only vague and indefinite images of its original sensations and perceptions, or without such images altogether. Another class thinks by means of images clearly and distinctly reproduced. Among thinkers of the latter order we find two types: (i) Analytic, simplifying its images by reducing them to the representation of a single characteristic; (2) synthetic, ampli- fying its images, and enriching them with vivid details. The first type is valuable if it selects the most important characteristic of its objects for representation, while the excellence of the second type depends upon its power to present its images in an orderly and rational succession. A. J. HAMLIN. In what sense are Psychical States extended? F. H. BRADLEY. Mind, No. I4, pp. 225-235. To predicate extension of the soul, when the soul is taken together and as one, is impossible. That is no better than it would be to term the soul acid, or salt, or fragrant. For, in the soul, extension is not a universal head or law under which adjectives fall: and, as</page><page sequence="3">No. 5.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 559 an adjective, it is not all-pervasive. It is really but one among a number of predicates, its position partial, its rank secondary. But the soul has features which are extended, and in respect of these features it is extended. This distinction between what the soul has and that which it is, -the distinction between what the soul is itself as a whole or directly, and what again it is indirectly and merely in respect of its parts, - is the solution of the problem. H. C. HOWE. ETHICAL. Les abus de l'inconnaissable en morale. ALFRED FOUILLEgE. Rev. Ph., XX, 5, pp. 457-48I. There has been a justifiable reaction against the materialistic form of determinism. This reaction has assumed two forms. The first places the mind and its essential modes of action among the true factors of determinism ; the second proposes to substitute a psychical (and also physical) indeterminism which regards the Unknown and Unknowable as the profound, ever active source of reality. It is our purpose to examine this second form. In our opinion the philosophy of the contingent rests upon a paralogism. It proposes to suppress or suspend the essential condition of knowledge, viz., the universality of the principle of Contradiction, and of the principle of Sufficient Reason. It annihilates the Known, or brings it under suspicion, to the profit of the Unknown. This Unknowable, rep- resented as ' spirit,' being an irrational spirit, unintelligent and unintelligible, is, in fact, the old matter of the ancients. But is not the hypothesis of an Unknowable necessary for morals? On the contrary, the natural result of the philosophy of the contingent is amoralism. The will, like a molecule of matter, always has a cause of action. We may not be able to understand this cause, or an act of the will, or, indeed, any sort of action taken abstractly, but any particular act is explicable precisely because it is particularly deter- mined. One may ask: "What is an act which is not determined? " What would you think of a physicist, chemist, or psychologist, who, being unable to enumerate the causes of certain phenomena in their respective domains, should declare that they were uncaused, or should attribute them to the miraculous intervention of some deity? We are free in both the practical and scientific senses of the word,</page><page sequence="4">560 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IV. if the future can be determined entirely by our own determination, i.e., if it is the result of our ideas, our sentiments, and our character. Even if one could prove the necessity of contingency for morality, it would be necessary to detach the element of contingency from the other elements in order to consider it in isolation. If you mix spontaneity, understanding, the idea and desire of freedom, with the contingency of acts unpredictable, your result will not belong entirely to the undetermined, but partly to the determined. Like freedom, responsibility loses all meaning, if it is grounded on an absolute contingency which escapes all knowledge. To be morally responsi- ble is to be self-determined, but the self is not an indifferent force. Further, to say an act is determined by our _ure self explains nothing, because (i) my lure self has no determination which distinguishes it from yours; (2) there is nothing to determine whether one act rather than any other should issue from its depths. Nor does this theory give any account of the moral good. Far from having a superior right, the moral law is a most insolent impiety towards spontaneity. The authority of moral ideas has no other origin than the mind's tendency towards equilibrium. D. R. MAJOR. The Motives to Moral Conduct. A. D6RING. Int. J. E., V., 3, pp. 36I-375. This paper, read recently before the Berlin Section of the German Society for Ethical Culture, is a brief statement of the writer's view as developed more fully in his book, Phiiosop/ische Giterlehre. " Every principle that aspires to dominance among mankind must make it its first aim to gain over the convictions, to win the intellectual adher- ence of men; only from this point, by a gradual growth inwards, can it conquer their hearts." Then arises the question as to the preponderant impulse, in accordance with the constitution of human nature, in the establishment of moral sentiment. The motives to goodness are: religious conviction, goodness for its own sake, logical reasonableness, individual profit, sympathy, habit, custom, love of honor, ' sense of honor,' and conscience. These are subjected to a threefold test, with the result that " the strongest among the motives of higher human nature is that which arises from our craving for self-esteem; its purest and best-sanctioned mode of operation is that which . . . we find in conscience." And the most perfect disposition to goodness is attained by the endeavor "to acquire in conscience a true value for one's self, a true warrant for one's existence." W. B. ELKIN.</page><page sequence="5">No. 5.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 56i The Ethical Consequences of the Doctrine of Immortality. W. LUTOSLAWSKI. Int. J. E., V. 3, Pp. 309-324. A person's aims and the comparative strength of his different motives to action vary according to his conception of life. The believer in immortality, therefore, may have all the earthly motives to action which the unbeliever has, but he has additional ones besides, which change the influence of the former. Hence the doc- trine of immortality is naturally calculated to have a twofold influ- ence on conduct: by adding new motives, and by altering the old ones. But it is only among philosophers that we find a full illustra- tion of the relation between belief in this doctrine and human con- duct. The doctrine of immortality is capable of proof - not, of course, to every one, for some individuals cannot grasp or realize the necessary conceptions, just as some persons cannot master the truths of higher mathematics. And having acquired knowledge of immor- tality " not less certain than any other part of scientific knowledge," one may regard calmly, not only the death of one's self, but also the death of one's nearest friends. "The poorest man, if he is a philosopher, may, after death, be more independent than the richest millionaire." Death is a kind of progress, and life a field of exercise for our intellectual and moral faculties. " The knowledge of immor- tality leaves us no other fear than the fear of our own injustice, and if we are always certain that death cannot bereave us of our intellec- tual and moral wealth, we do not mind the danger of death in the war with oppression, injustice, and crime." W. B. ELKIN. METAPHYSICAL AND EPISTEMOLOGICAL. Mr. Balfour's Dialectics. HERBERT SPENCER. Fortnightly Review, June, i895, pp. 86i-873. The comforting character of a belief is not an adequate reason for entertaining it. The supposition that the universe is constituted so as to minister to man's " needs and aspirations," is not in accordance with the facts. In adopting this view, Mr. Balfour assumes the ex- istence of a Rational Creator, since the view in question is only tenable on this assumption. While agreeing with his estimate of the relative shares of Authority and Reason in determining our beliefs, one must insist that Reason cannot essentially discredit Reason. If</page><page sequence="6">562 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IV. any other ruler is raised to the throne, in part or for a time, it is by Reason that this is done. The supremacy of Reason is exercised in the act of choosing the Authority. The choice is determined by the comparative degrees of trustworthiness of the various Authorities as ascertained by experience. When, as in the present case, the con- tending Authorities are those of Religion and Science, Reason is compelled to choose the Authority of the latter, for Science is steadily becoming more reliable, while the dicta of Theology are being shown more untrustworthy every day. - We may now take up Mr. Balfour's attack on my fundamental position. He describes me as holding that, beyond what we think and know, and in closest relation with it, lies an infinite field we never can know, and yet which cannot be ignored without making what we know meaningless. He goes on to say that I have failed to see that, if the certitudes of Science lose themselves in the depths of unfathomable mystery, it may well be that out of these same depths the certitudes of Religion emerge. But I have nowhere denied that the certitudes of Religion may so emerge. That would be inconsistent. I only demur to Mr. Balfour's statement that they do. If they have emerged, how comes it that so many different conceptions of the Deity have been entertained, not only at different times, but by different persons at the same time? Assuming further that the conception of a Rational Creator, as it exists for Mr. Balfour, is the only true one, it must be shown that there are some mentally representable traits which constitute it, for thinking, truly so-called, implies mental representation of the things and processes named. The essential traits must, however, be un- representable, since they must be mere abstractions of human activi- ties existing unlocalized and multiplied to infinity. The assertion of their existence, therefore, becomes merely the blank form of a thought, and expresses merely one of those pseudD-ideas which delude us in all departments of knowledge. The difference between Mr. Balfour's consciousness of that which lies behind appearances and the consciousness of those he opposes, is that he persists in sup- posing himself to have thoughts when, under close examination, all the components of thoughts have vanished, while they candidly admit that when such components have disappeared the thoughts have vanished also. DAVID IRONS.</page><page sequence="7">No. 5.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 563 Reality and Causation. W. CARLILE. Mind, No. I3, PP. 82-91; No. I4, pp. 2I3-224. In searching for an ultimate criterion in Philosophy, we find that one frequently employed is that of the natural use of language. That this appeal to common use is justified will be best seen from the fact, that the process by which we prove an individual thing comes under a conception is the very same as the process by which, in the first instance, we have constituted the conception. Are all' questions of Philosophy, then, only questions as to the meanings of words ? An unsuspectedly large portion of them are. If, however, it is certain that the natural use of language may be appealed to as a final criterion, it is none the less true that the popular use of language is the most fertile source of philosophical error. An examination of words expressive of elementary notions, such as Reality and Causation, will furnish an indication of the way in which these two positions may be reconciled. -What happens when we first learn the signification of the word 'real'? I have certain mus- cular and tactual sensations, peculiar to me, as I grasp the object, and an auditory sensation, common to both of us, as I utter the word 'real.' You have certain muscular and tactual sensations, peculiar to you, as you grasp the object, and an auditory sensation, common to both of us and recognized to be similar to the former sensation of sound, as you utter the word 'real' in turn to show that you understand and concur. At first, therefore, our ideal of Reality embraces the element of tangibility and that of the concurrence of others. We apply the conception next to a sound, to distinguish a real from a fancied sound; and thus drop the element of tangibility. We may apply it next to objects not perceived by us, or to the world as it existed antecedent to consciousness; and then we drop so important a part of its connotation that the applicability of the word itself becomes the great dispute of Philosophy. This extension of application, with accompanying attenuation of meaning, is the fact which gives the solution of the problem with which we started. When the meaning of the type is in question, language is justly regarded as the last court of appeal; where the applicability of the words is doubtful, language will mislead the unwary.- The view that antecedence and consequence are the sole content of the idea of causation will not square with the facts. Those who maintain this position have begun with those applications of the word which have the widest range and the minimum of connotation. As in the case of Reality, the word means more in the type instance than in its</page><page sequence="8">564 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IV. derivative applications. For the ordinary man, 'to cause anything' is 'to do something'; to move an object, for example. There are three things involved in this conception. (i) There is motion on the part of the mover and the thing moved. (2) The motion on the part of the cause is prior to, or at least simultaneous with, the motion of the thing moved. (3) The cause is not manifestly moved by some- thing else. The type-notion of cause thus primarily involves refer- ence to a living being as something which can of itself originate action. When we say that a stone sinks in water because of its relatively greater specific gravity, we are evidently using ' cause' in a secondary sense. It is in a case like this that the meaning of Cause becomes entangled with the meaning of Law, and that we come into contact for the first time with the conception of invariable suc- cession as a characteristic of causation. DAVID IRONS. The Evolution of Religion. BERNARD BOSANQUET. Int. J. E., V, 4, PP. 432-444. The principle of evolution applied to the history of religion is valuable in two ways. (i) It helps us to explain the lower forms by the higher. Instead of maintaining that, since religion may be traced back to dreams, it itself is but a dream, evolution helps us, knowing the highest development of religion, to appreciate the divine impulse in its early stages. Thus we are freed from the task of trying to define religion by some element common to all, even the lowest, forms. (2) Evolution enables us to understand the conflict of form and substance, the occurrence of contradictory phases in the same religion, by showing us that the human spirit is the same, what- ever formal attitude it may take. The three phases of religious development correspond to the three phases of conscious experience: the world or object, the self or subject, their unity or God. In the objective period of religion, man's consciousness is largely absorbed in the world about him. Though not unmindful of himself and of some connection between himself and the outer world, he regards that self as one natural object among others, and seeks to explain the connection by deifying some stone or river. This is fetishism. Its morality is limited in scope to the members of one family or tribe, which the fetish guards. Or we have ancestor-worship, where the object of adoration is not, as Mr. Spencer holds, a real ancestor deified, but the fetish regarded as an ancestor because regarded as specially connected with the tribe. When fetishism develops into</page><page sequence="9">No. 5.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 565 anthropomorphism, when man is deified, though but as a natural object, we have the boundary between objective and subjective religion. The latter absolutely refuses to find God anywhere but in spirit or mind; it despises and defies nature. The two great ex- amples are Judaism and Mahometanism. But the highest religion is absolute religion, where the unity between mind and nature is apprehended as that divinity which progressively reveals itself in the spirit of man, and also in the order and beauty of the natural world from which he issues. MARGARET WASHBURN. HISTORICAL. Die Le/re des Anaxagoras vom Geist und der Seele. EMIL ARLETH. Ar. f. G. d. Ph., VIII, i, pp. 59-85. Anaxagoras has generally been regarded as the inquirer who first introduced into philosophy the notion of mind as distinct from that of matter. This view, however, has not gone uncontested. Brucker, Tiedernann, Kern, Grote, Peiper, and Windelband all dispute this service of Anaxagoras to philosophy, and hold that the Nous is only one amongst other material principles. It is different from other matter only by being thinner, more aether-like. Zeller takes a medi- ating position, regarding the Nous as incorporeal, yet as occupying space. The doctrine is to him half-materialistic: Anaxagoras began the breach between mind and matter, but did not complete it. Freudenthal and Heinze are defenders of the spirituality of the Nous. The author takes up in detail the following grounds urged by those who assert the corporeality of the noetic principle. (i) Nous is called by Anaxagoras xpr/.a (fragm. 6). But that Xp^/xa is not used here in the sense of a corporeal thing, is shown by Aristotle (Met. I. 8. 989 a 3O ff.); also by the words in fragm. 6: IJrEt xX E'v WC7raVTWv Xp'aUv dT GE tLIKTO TE ). (2) Anaxagoras calls the Nous X7ro-Tarov (fragm. 6), and because this is a physical attribute, the Nous must be corporeal. But the metaphorical application of physical attri- butes to psychical phenomena is universal, e.g., hot passion, sharp wit, deep feeling, etc. Further, we find in Homer /xqzrt - XE7rr , and in Euripides X7rroI-S vovw. (3) In Plato's Cracylus (4I3 C) it is said of Nous that it orders all things and passes through all things. This ascription of motion to the Nous, it is asserted, implies its corporeal- ity. But the context shows, says the author, that this is an impossible</page><page sequence="10">566 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IV. interpretation. (4) Fragm. 6: vo'og &amp; wrs OEO' 7rali 5S ET LEWV o E'aXowv. The reference here is not to the corporeally larger and smaller, as urged by the defenders of the corporeality of the Nous, but to the greater or smaller spiritual endowment. Further, there is to be added to the inconclusiveness of these arguments for the material nature of Nous, the fact of their inherent improbability. The Hylozoist had conceived of all matter as intelligent, and it is not likely that Anaxagoras could have taken the retrograde step of positing two matters, one intelligent and the other unintelligent. Nor would there, on this view, be any meaning in the testimony of Aristotle that Anaxagoras brought forward a new principle in philoso- phy, if the principle were, like that of the Hylozoists, only that of matter endowed with intelligence. The entire separation of the principles of matter and mind is further testified to by Diog. Laert. (II. 6) and Cicero (De nat. deor. I. i i). Further, the Nous is unmixed. It does not enter into concrete things as a component part. It is transcendent. In defense of this, the author cites and interprets Aristotle (De an. III. 4. 429 a 20; Met. IV. 5,1009 C 25). Further, the Nous is absolute (cf. fragm. 6; also Cratybis, 4I3); on the other hand, matter is conditioned. Again, the Nous is simple (De an. I. 2. 405 a i6). Material things, on the other hand, are all composite; for in every material thing is a part of everything else (Ev 7racVTL ravrosI Aopa Evea-Tt). But by calling the Nous simple, Anaxagoras thereby denied at once that it is composed of varied parts, and, by implication, its corporeality. W. A. H. Zu Anaxagoras. E. ZELLER. Ar. f. G. d.

Griech., I, 994 (5th ed.), of the Anaxagorean Nous "that parts of it are in the particular things." This was attacked in the Archiv. VIII, i. by Arleth, who asserted that in the doctrine of Anaxagoras Nous was indivisible and transcendent. Zeller finds support for his position in fragm. 8 (6). W. A. H. Die Lehre des Anaxagoras vom Geist und der Seele. EMIL ARLETH. Ar. f. G. d. Ph., VIII, 2, pp. 190-205. The question has been raised amongst a number of modern inves- tigators whether the Anaxagorean Nous is a personality, and most of</page><page sequence="11">No. 5.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 567 them have answered in the negative. Zeller notes that the two most important marks of personality are wanting in this Nous, viz., free self- determination and self-consciousness. Arleth combats both points. He instances that the imparting by the Nous of the first impulse to cosmical movement indicates free self-determination, but further questions the statement that such self-determination is really an essential mark of personality. As to the matter of self-conscious- ness, he points out that the ascription of omniscience to the Nous and the denial of self-consciousness involve a contradiction; but Anaxagoras gives unqualified expression to this attribute of omnis- cience. Further, the Nous is all-powerful, yet, according to the view of those who deny the personality, the Nous has no power over his own psychical acts, albeit the Nous-doctrine is constructed on the admitted analogy of human understanding, which has such power. The very term Nous carries with it the implication of self- consciousness, and is meaningless without it. A deity without self- consciousness would be merely the arena for the passing to and fro of thoughts indifferent and unknown to it, vov's avorp-oS. Again, such a conception makes the relation of the world-reason to the reason of the individual unintelligible. If, furthermore, the Nous were imper- sonal and unconscious, the world would be really under the rule of EftapLEvr, a view which Anaxagoras avowedly rejects. One must conclude that the Nous of Anaxagoras was conceived as a personal- ity. There is a further question, viz., whether he distinguished between mind and soul. It has generally been held that he re- garded them as different aspects of the same thing: there is only one spirit; as world-mover, transcendent, it is mind; as immanent principle of life, it is soul. It is rather a question of manner than of matter. This immanence, however, cannot be ascribed to Anax- agoras. The description of the unmixed nature and the independ- ence, absoluteness, of the Nous is against such a view, and, in every case where the divine principle is referred to as source of motion, it is always as a transcendent cause and never as immanent. W. A. H. Kant comme savant. G. MILHAUD. Rev. Ph., XX, 5, pp. 482-5I0. M. Drews in an elaborate work entitled Kant's Naturphkilosophie als Grundlage seines Systems, maintains that from I755 to I78i Kant's main object was to justify a physical dynamism against a physical mechanism. The Critique of Pure Reason is the last and</page><page sequence="12">568 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. supreme effort in this direction. It supplies us with universal and necessary laws, and furnishes the foundation for a Philosophy of Nature. The Kant of M. Drews is essentially a philosopher of nature. We may ask: Does science owe to Kant any permanent advance? Did he produce in this field anything durable? He devoted some attention to Physical Geography, but he discovered no new facts. He had no laboratory; carried out no experiments; made no excursions. Although there is in his works some proof of origi- nality, his merit lay in the systematic coordination of the facts known in his day, and in the attempt to substitute for pure description an explanation by the historical process. But in these respects he was not in advance of Buffon, Linnaus, Lamarck, and others of his time. In natural science he most resembles Goethe - a poet guided by the sense of the harmony of things. But perhaps it is in spheres where great power of abstract reasoning is required that Kant, guided by his learning and special research, rises to grand theories. The Germans are accustomed to claim for him the honor of first stating the -nebular hypothesis, commonly attributed to Laplace; but while there is some resemblance between the two theories, their difference is very marked. The Theory of the Heavens, in which this view is advanced, is replete with most ingenious ideas, and full of poetry and charm. Further, it is unquestionable that certain con- ceptions presented in this work have led to valuable results, but they are mixed with much speculation more poetic than scientific. Pass- ing to the Theory of Motion, one cannot attach great importance to it historically, because it was preceded by the works of Galileo, Roberval, and Newton. The second chapter of The Metaphysical iFoundlation of Natural Science contains Kant's views concerning the constitution of matter. To the mechanism of Democritus and Descartes, he opposes a dynamic conception of matter. In this work he also discusses the laws of motion and gives proof of some origi- nality in first stating clearly the principle of Inertia. - Our conclusion is that Kant has no prominent place in the history of science. He touched a number of questions, but as a philosopher rather than as a scientist. His views are sometimes ingenious but always rather vague. They resemble those of Aristotle and the Ionians more than those of Euler and Newton. D. R. MAJOR.</page></plain_text>
