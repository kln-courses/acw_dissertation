<plain_text><page sequence="1">EARLY INDIAN SCULPTURE. By Ludwig Bachkofer. XXX VI, i37 PP.; Iz6 pls. 4to. New York, The Pegasus Press, Harcourt, Brace &amp;" Co. In the Far East, life and art are two inseparable factors. The Indian, from rajah to pariah, understands the expres- sion of his age, without words of interpretation, while an old Chinese proverb says: "A single picture is of more value than a thousand words." This state of accord exists in an ideally balanced and sensitized community, where art is an expression of its inherent life, thoughts, and feelings. Such a unity might conceivably rule out the ability even to comprehend any culture foreign to the community's own experience. In the highly complex Western world of to-day, life and art are not conterminous, and the average citizen is not aware that art exists outside of museums or movie theatres. The critic attempts to bring the two closer by analyzing, theorizing, and expatiating on the art of the past as well as that of the present. He also tries to understand and interpret the art of another race and tradition. This is more difficult, and history and criticism both are needed, for it is necessary to explain the actuality of this art, just why it is, what it is, and why it could not be otherwise. Under these circumstances one is perhaps justified in using a thousand words of criticism in an attempt to understand a single work of art. The process of criticism, however, tends to become so absorbing that one goes even farther and loses sight completely of the work which he is criticizing. Endless fallacies arise as a result, which have been repeated so many times that they seem axioms. One can not seem to remember, for instance, that Greek art or Christian doctrines have nothing to do with the past experience of Eastern art, and are therefore not applicable; that an art new and strange and different from our norm is not necessarily crude, quaint, or exotic. It is so easy to hunt for things familiar, and then to relate one's findings with the source of that familiarity, or, even more, to consider all things as borrowed, and nothing indigenous. The amount of illustrative material in Bachhofer's book speaks volumes to the initiated, and gives to the uninitiated, if he be at all sensitive, a complete, if un- analyzed impression of the development of Indian sculp- ture. Bachhofer's method of emphasizing the illustrative material, and of making brief comments of a historical and critical nature is excellent. In these comments, however, he has not always succeeded in keeping free of those common fallacies of critics. Bachhofer's study of the AMokan, or Mauryan, period is stylistically minute, but the dating daring, and to deny the existence of any earlier native expression is indiscreetly valorous. There can be no "contemporary" art without inheritance of tendencies that have been the particular determining forces of preexisting civilization. Of course there has been a past to such a complete present as the Mauryan period. It is quite impossible to think that any foreign impulse was strong enough to create in a new soil never yet tilled or in any way prepared. Let us accept for the moment, the dating of those early figure statues such as the Parkham statue, and place them, as Bachhofer does, as crude works of the Mauryan dynasty, instead of earlier pre-Mauryan works, and then turn to the following statements: "Slowly and hesitatingly the Indian people found itself ready to enter the sphere of high art . . . it was only in the III B. C. that the streams of inspiration began to flow. And even then it was not a steady self development, for foreign hands had to clear the path and to point the way." "In the III century the darkness shrouding the history of Indian art begins to disperse. Only later, when the great religious systems had grown up, . . . the sense of the Indian people for sculptural creation was awakened. The impulse came from outside S.. (from Persia) India required a powerful stimulus before it was able to emerge from the depths of handicraft and to enter the free field of higher art." These seem amazing and sweeping statements. Although the Indian bell-shaped capitals may have come from a cognate source, they are admittedly different from the Persian lotus-flower support. AMoka himself, moreover, speaks of earlier columns in India. Nor does the perfectly polished surface of these monolithic columns need to be explained by outside influence, for it is well known that the early Indian was highly skilled in polishing gems. Why should we be surprised at the application of that skill to another material so closely allied, particularly when an emperor was feting a new religion? The Parkham statue Bachhofer regards as "clumsy," and along with the other similar statues of massive columnal proportions, as poorer work of the Mauryan dynasty. I think these are in many ways superior to the Smrnth columns. In describing them, however, Bachhofer is several times forced to say they are Indian, although he</page><page sequence="2">202 THE ART BULLETIN places them in a period which he characterizes as primarily Persian. "The two Yakyas of Patna are, as far as cast, dress, and ornamentation are concerned, entirely Indian." Still he places them in the Agokan period, on the grounds that they are executed in the same style as the AAokan columns, and that the stone of which they are made "comes from Chunar, like the columns of AMoka." This reasoning is inconclusive, and nothing prevents a reverse argument, i. e., the AMokan columns, being made from the same stone as the figure statues, are derived from the early figure style. This latter point of view is taken by Coomaraswamy. Compare the following statement of Coomaraswamy in his Introduction to Indian Art: "The oldest Indian sculpture so far known appears to be the well-known 'Parkham statue,' of the Mathurd Museum, which bears, according to recent readings, inscription referring to Kunika Ajdta5atru of the saiqun~ga Dynasty -who died 618 B. C." with Bachhofer's: "Mathurd-- Pdrkham Yake.a-End of the III B. C. According to Vogel's interpretation the inscription says that the statue had been made by Bhadapugarin-Gomitaka a disciple of Kunika." Coomaraswamy bears out his early dating of this figure by placing the two Patna Yakyas also earlier than the Mauryan dynasty, as typical manifestations of early Indian native expression: "The two statues found at Patna bear the names of other ?aiqunaga emperors, Udayin and Nanda Vardhana, both of the fifth century B. C." Bachhofer quotes no source for his dating of the Patna Yakla "second third of the III century B. C." Bachhofer's analysis of the spirit of the sculpture is very fine, and shows a keen appreciation. Only occasionally do Westernisms creep in. Greek anthropomorphism and Christian doctrines of non-sensousness confuse the issue, and obstruct the consistent development of his presenta- tion. He speaks of Sanchi as "distinguished by a keen interest in worldly things rather than a deep understanding of the pessimistic truths of salvation." Of KRrli figures he says they show "proud humanity, heroic bodies full of strength and self-assurance." And later he states "It is self-evident that the altered ideal of the body conceals a fundamentally different extent of expression, for that calm strength which emanates from the couples of Karli we shall never encounter again during the later period. An easy serenity and cheerfulness flow through the figures, and everything is gay and animated not only in the gestures, but even more so in the heart. Everything is illumined by a spirit of comfortable enjoyment." Amarivati he in- terprets as manifesting a "trembling, almost hysterical unrest." Coomaraswamy, on the other hand, unifies such contradictions and changes between things sensuous and things spiritual, as follows: "A conception of life is reflected, in which all sensuous and spiritual elements are warp and woof of a single texture; so far from conflictive with each other, as they conflict in Christian thought, each is the inevitable expression of the other. Physical beauty is the outward form of innate virtue; luxury and pleasure not seductive, but naturally befit and are inevitably evoked by psychological maturity." Concerning the Gandhara school and the discrepancy of Bachhofer's date for Kaniqka, 78 A. D., as opposed to the usual date, 129 A. D., I feel quite incompetent to judge. It is a much discussed period, and one open to many in- terpretations. Since the flourishing of the Gandhara school coincides with, and continues after, the reign of Kaniqka, the earlier dating of Kanieka alters somewhat, but not materially, the argument that the Gandhara Buddhas are earlier, and therefore the source of all such anthropomorphically conceived figures. The Hellenistic origin of the Buddha image is accordingly affected. How- ever, it still remains evident that Buddhas are represented in Mathura as well as in GandhAra, in a style only at times allied to the latter school, and continuing an uninterrupted development in pure Indian style long after the Gandhara school had ceased to exist. This fact is significant in itself, if far from conclusive proof of any priority. The make-up of the book is arresting. The brilliant cover, the liberal margins, the bold readable type, the lavish cuts, all give an imposing stamp to the book, in some respects laudable, but in others bordering on a breach of refined taste. The text tissues opposite the cuts are excellent from a practical standpoint, but the blatant numbers of the plates on these call harshly for attention. Typographical errors are all too frequent, indicating care- less proof reading. For instance, the two references given in connection with pl. 58 (cf. pp. XXIV, 45 and pp. XXIV, 44) are inconsistent; and pl. 117, left-hand medallion, is in the British Museum and not in Madras. One regrets that so many mistakes could creep into a book of such weight and importance. Ethel Hahn</page></plain_text>
