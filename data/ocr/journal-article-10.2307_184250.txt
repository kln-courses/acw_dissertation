JOHNSON This article is an attempt to: (a) outline the essential elements in Alfred North Whitehead's theory of "actual entities"; (b) indicate the erroneous nature of a number of widely held interpretations and criticisms of his speculative scheme; (c) state criticisms which seem legitimately applicable to Whitehead's cosmology.l Whitehead's theory of actual entities can only be understood if one continually bears in mind Whitehead's purpose in formulating this theory and the method which he uses in his project. PURPOSE Unlike many contemporary philosophers, Whitehead believes that it is possible to "frame a coherent, logical, necessary system of general ideas in terms of which every element in our experience can be interpreted."2 Not only does he attempt to formulate a comprehensive speculative scheme; he is particularly anxious to 1 During recent years several books and articles have been devoted to at least some phases of this same general project.

JOHNSON formulate one which will do justice to the aesthetic, moral and religious experi- ence of men, as well as the data of the natural sciences.3 In doing this he is attempting to correct what he regards as a disastrous mis- take which has been repeated again and again by successive philosophers. Whitehead deplores the fact that the main emphasis in many philosophies has been placed on the doctrine that the real entities in the universe are static and self-sufficient. This point of view received clear formulation in that phase of Plato's thought wherein he stressed the unchanging perfection of the realm of "Ideas". The Aristotelian logic and metaphysics embodying the notion of sub- stance, added impetus to this tendency. The claim that the ultimate substances, passively receiving qualifications, are in no essential way related to each other was given typical expression in Descartes' influential exposition of the body-mind dualism. This emphasis on the separateness of essential elements carried over into the work of Locke, Berkeley and Hume. It is Whitehead's contention that the theories of these men cannot do justice to our ordinary experience of the genuine interconnections of real entities. Developing this point, Whitehead stresses the contention that our mental experiences are not atomized, as was claimed by the metaphysical psychologists of the seventeenth and eithteenth centures. He argues that those who hold this mistaken view overlook "the vague compulsions and derivations which form the main stuff of experience."4 Hume provides an example of the position which Whitehead seeks to refute. For Hume sense data are "here, now, immediate and discrete". Whitehead contends that on the basis of this assumption it is impossible to account for memory or induction. Further, in a lengthy analysis of a concrete situation, he demonstrates Hume's inability to account for the experienced relationship of the various components of a complex sequence of temporal experiences in even as simple a case as that of uttering a phrase.5 In physical science based on the Newtonian point of view, Whitehead finds further examples of the unfortunate results of mistaken emphasis on "exclusiveness". According to Newtonian physics the world is composed of ultimate particles, each with an absolutely definite place in space and time and requiring (for the explanation of its essential characteristics) no reference to any other particles or any other regions. If this be so, induction is day-dreaming and the formula- tion of laws idle fancy. There is the further difficulty that Newtonian physics resulted in a tendency to disparage the complexities of life and consciousness and in some instances it issued in the suggestion that everything in the universe may be completely explained in terms of physical concepts. METHOD Whitehead contends that a speculative scheme, such as his, must be firmly anchored in experience. Thus he states: "Metaphysical categories are not dogmatic statements of the obvious; they are tentative formulations of the ultimate generalities" (discoverable in all actual experience).6 3 P.

See later, intensive, discussion of this point). 238</page><page sequence="3">WHITEHEAD S THEORY OF ACTUAL ENTITIES His discussion of the method of speculative philosophy stresses the importance of beginning with a relatively restricted group of data, for example the field of physics, or psychology, or aesthetics. On this particular basis a generalization is built up which it is hoped will apply in all fields. Whitehead expresses this idea in terms of a very effective analogy. "The true method of discovery (of first principles) is like the flight of an aeroplane. It starts from the ground of particu- lar observation; it makes a flight in the thin air of imaginative generalization; and it again lands for renewed observation."7 But, to carry on the analogy, a successful flight involves landing on a field other than the base from which the flight started. "The success of the imaginative experiment is always to be tested by the applicability of its results beyond the restricted locus from which it originated."8 Thus Whitehead takes as his goal the formulation of a meta- physical system which is to be achieved, not by verbal juggling, but by an honest reporting of all the facts. "Metaphysics is nothing but the description of the generalities which apply to all the details of practice (experience)."9 One of the most frequent criticisms of Whitehead's method is that it "gives almost free rein to arbitrary assumptions".10 Recent articles by Murphy have focused attention on this type of criticism. He contends that Whitehead makes up his mind concerning the nature of ultimate reality, not as the result of em- pirical testing but on the basis of attitude and antecedent stipulation. "We want to know what a full or concrete fact is, and for this, Whitehead holds, we must look to our own experience. And there is no doubt that such 'concreteness' does include our emotional responses to the world and that these are humanly important.-May we then go on to maintain that any actual fact is a fact of aesthetic experience-I cannot for my own part see the slightest reason for sup- posing that hosts of entities in the world around me may not be as 'vacuously actual' as they appear to be. They may have feelings too, for all I know, but to claim that, under penalty of non-existence, they must have them in order to enjoy the type of emotional concern that renders my experience a 'complete' fact, seems a very questionable procedure."" Thus Murphy contends that when Whitehead comes to formulate his theory of actual entities he turns his back on careful observation and verification and stipulates that ultimate reality must be of the nature of aesthetic experience because he happens to think that such experience is of ultimate importance and reality. In making this criticism Murphy simply shuts his eyes to the fact that although Whitehead is offering a description of ultimate reality which admittedly is formu- 7 P.

JOHNSON lated on the basis of a careful examination of human experience, yet this theory is also supported by a thorough examination of non-human facts. It is not a case of trying to force the universe into a categorical straight-jacket. Whitehead examines part of the universe, formulates his theories and then tests them by reference to other phases of the universe. (This point will be substantiated in the course of this article.) Whitehead himself states: "Philosophy destroys its usefulness when it indulges in brilliant feats of explaining away.... It is a disease of philosophy when it is neither bold nor humble, but merely a reflection of the tempermental presuppositions of exceptional personalities."l2 A criticism, similar in general import to that of Murphy's is outlined by J. Ratner. He claims that when Whitehead attempts to examine experience he always finds that experience supports his principles because experience is ap- proached in terms of these principles. However, having thus argued that White- head disregards objective fact, Ratner admits that sometimes Whitehead puts facts before theory. But, says Ratner, this is in opposition to Whitehead's other method, that of assigning priority to theory. On this basis Whitehead is charged with vacillation.13 The fallacious nature of Ratner's comments should be obvious from the preceding discussion. In any case, detailed, subsequent discussion will substantiate this criticism of Ratner. In view of Whitehead's early fame as a mathematician, one would expect him to (a) use the method of mathematics in his thinking; (b) make extensive use of the data of mathematics (and physics) in dealing with philosophical problems. As a matter of fact, there are some students of Whitehead who make this con- tention. For example, Emmet states: "I am continually conscious that the way in which his mind is working is essentially that of a pure mathematician."'4 Lowe, while he does not take so extreme a position, refers to the "semi-mathe- matical method employed in Process and Reality."'5 In developing the sug- gestion that Whitehead uses a semi-mathematical method, Lowe admits that for Whitehead "Philosophical discussion ... is not a mathematical deduction, but an examination of experience."'6 However, in justifying his comment concerning Whitehead's method, he claims that when the facts of experience have been examined, then Whitehead proceeds to conjecture "a scheme in form analagous to a set of interrelated assumptions, primitive ideas, and definitions.... The method is mathematical because the author is aiming at a single concept of the universe, in which the various ideas form a mutual circle from which none can be excised without leaving a gap between principles involving the others-for 12 P.

However, is not Lowe em- ploying a "special" use of the term mathematics?l8 As Lowe himself points out, Whitehead has expressed very vigorous criticism of the method of mathematics. He contends that philosophy has been misled by the deductive method of mathematics.l9 It is to be noted that here the term mathematics is being used in a different sense than that employed by Lowe. Further, Lowe's reference to mathematics as involving "assumptions" and "definitions" reminds one that many mathematicians would not agree with Lowe's claim that mathematics is a report of observed fact. Do not many mathematical systems start with ad- mittedly arbitrary assumptions and definitions?20 The assumption that Whitehead makes extensive use of the data of mathe- matics (and physics) in the solving of philosophical problems does not receive very impressive substantiation in those writings in which he states his position in final form. Indeed as one examines Whitehead's theory of actual entities (as expounded in Process and Reality, Adventures of Ideas, and Modes of Thought), the impression becomes very strong that Whitehead places increasing weight on the fundamental importance of examining "psychological data". Indeed, one of the most frequently repeated criticisms of Whitehead is that he tries to read into the sub-human level of existence types of activity which are found only on the human level.21 This is not to deny that Whitehead's work in mathematics and theoretical physics, exerted some influence when he came to formulate his theory of actual entities. However, the fact remains that in his mature philo- sophical work he turns almost exclusively to psychological concepts in order to express the general ideas (categories) which he claims are applicable to all details of experience, including experienced physical objects. Thus Whitehead points out that he is an advocate of the subjectivist principle in philosophy. "The subjectivist principle is that the whole universe consists of elements disclosed in the analysis of the experiences of subjects.... It follows that the philosophy of organism entirely accepts the subjectivist basis of modern philosophy."22 Whitehead emphasizes the fact that he concentrates on what he terms aesthetic 17 Lowe, pp. 104 and 103. 18 This theory of mathematics is apparently stated by Dewey. See The Philosophical Review, Vol. XLVI (1937), p. 174. For a brief statement of other theories of mathematics see Bertrand Russell, My Mental Development, The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell (P. A.

"The metaphysical doctrine, here expounded, finds the foundations of the world in the aesthetic experience, rather than-as with Kant-in the cognitive and conceptive experience."23 He clarifies this point by stating: "an actual fact is a fact of aesthetic experience. All aesthetic experience is feeling arising out of the realization of contrast under identity."24 In justifying this subjectivistic approach Whitehead argues that "any doctrine which refuses to place human experience outside nature, must find in descriptions of human experience factors which also enter into the descriptions of less special- ized natural occurrences. If there be no such factors, then the doctrine of human experience as a fact within nature is mere bluff."25 An even more effective and factual type of argument is that which states: "The philosophy of organism attributes 'feeling' throughout the actual world. It bases this doctrine upon the directly observed fact that 'feeling' survives as a known element constitutive of the 'formal' existence of such actual entities as we can best observe.26 Also when we observe the causal nexus, devoid of interplay with sense-presentation, the influx of feeling with vague qualitative and 'vector' definition, is what we find."27 Finally Whitehead tries to show, using specific illustrations, that "the general principles of physics are exactly what we should expect as a specific exemplification of the metaphysics required by the philosophy of organism."28 Some critics of Whitehead's work are appalled and incensed by his apparently flippant and unjust references to science. For example, he states: "Discussions on the method of science wander off on the topic of experiment. But experiment is nothing else than a mode of cooking the facts for the sake of exemplifying the law."29-"The Certainties of Science are a delusion."30 These iconoclastic statements can be understood only when placed in their proper context. White- head is continually emphasizing the grave danger involved in concentration on too narrow a range of acts. He points out that "it is easy enough to find a theory, logically harmonious with important applications in the region of fact, provided that you are content to disregard half your evidence. Every age pro- duces people with clear logical intellects, and with the most praiseworthy grasp of the importance of some sphere of human experience, who have elaborated, or 23 A. N.

Such people are apt resolutely to ignore, or to explain away, all evidence which confuses their scheme with contradictory instances. What they cannot fit in is for them nonsense."31-"Consider, for example, the scientific notion of measurement. Can we elucidate the turmoil of Europe by weighing its dictators, its prime ministers, and its editors of newspapers? The idea is absurd, although some relevant information might be obtained. I am not up- holding the irrelevance of science. Such a doctrine would be foolish. For ex- ample, a daily record of the bodily temperatures of the men, above mentioned, might be useful. My point is the incompleteness of the information."32-"Thus the Certainties of Science are a delusion. They are hedged around with unex- plored limitations. Our handling of scientific doctrines is controlled by the diffused metaphysical concepts of our epoch."33 It appears then that Whitehead's apparently unjustified condemnation of scientific experiment as "nothing else than a mode of cooking the facts for the sake of exemplifying the law" is an overstatement of a point which needs to be made. True, Whitehead may be condemned for overstatement but he hardly merits Ratner's vehement reproach that he dismissed experiment "as beneath consideration, after making acknowledgements for extraordinary services."34 The reference by Ratner to "extraordinary services" reminds one that Whitehead does not criticize all experiments. He stresses the great value of the work of Michelson and the German opticians. However, the fact remains that White- head does criticize experiments which proceed dogmatically and disregard relevant facts. Ratner's sweeping charge that "experiment finds no place in any of Whitehead's philosophical books"35 therefore cannot be allowed to pass without denial. It is true that Whitehead does not make extensive reference to experi- ments in physics, chemistry and biology. (Ratner mentions Whitehead's refer- ence to the experiments conducted by Galileo and Percy Lowell.) But, if experi- ment means "controlled and verified observation", then it is obvious that White- head advocates and uses it in his study of human experience. Such study is the basis of his (later) metaphysical theorizing. This point will be further sub- stantiated in subsequent discussion. It is Whitehead's contention that genuine, comprehensive, knowledge involves ultimately what he calls "insight" or "intuition". "All knowledge is derived from, and verified by, direct intuitive observation."36 By intuition Whitehead does not mean the experience of an "exceptional" moment. Rather, it is simply the grasp of facts as they are, not as they appear to superficial examination. Das overlooks this point when he objects that Whitehead has "not clearly 31 A. N.

JOHNSON shown how one can arrive at that, intuition or grasp it in terms of ordinary thought."37 He ?uggests further that "it would have been better, of course, if he had clearly shown in every case how and from what data of common experi- ence he arrived at his philosophic conclusions."38 The subsequent discussion of Whitehead's theory of actual entities will indicate in detail the invalidity of Das' criticism. Throughout all Whitehead's cosmological ?peculations there is manifest an admirable lack of dogmatism. "Metaphysical categories are not dogmatic statements of the obvious. They are tentative formulations .... There remains the final reflection, how shallow, puny, and imperfect are efforts to sound the depths in the nature of things. In philosophic discussion, the merest hint of dogmatic certainty as to finality of statement is an exhibition of folly."39 ACTUAL ENTITIES Whitehead's cosmology is based on the contention that actual entities "are the final real things of which the world is made up."40 An understanding of Whitehead's description of the characteristics of an actual entity is greatly facilitated by the careful study of a non-technical paragraph in Modes of Thought: "I find myself as essentially a unity of emotions, enjoyments, hopes, fears, regrets, valuations of alternatives, decisions-all of them subjective reactions to the environment as active in my nature. The individual enjoyment is what I am in my r6le of a natural activity, as I shape the activities of the environment into a new creation, which is myself at this moment; and yet, as being myself, it is a continuation of the antecedent world. If we stress the r6le of the environ- ment, this process is causation. If we stress the r6le of my immediate pattern of active enjoyment, this process is self-creation. If we stress the role of the conceptual anticipation of the future whose existence is a necessity in the nature of the present, this process is the teleological aim at some ideal in the future."41 A careful examination of the preceding quotation will reveal that Whitehead is making the following claims concerning the nature of a subject. A subject (a) is chiefly, though not exclusively, affective as far as the content of its experience is concerned; (b) is a unity of its component parts; (c) has its environment active 37 R. Das, The Philosophy of Whitehead, p. 190. Hereafter this book will be referred to as "Das". 38 Das, p. 194. 39 P. R., pp. 12 and x. 40 P. R., p. 27. It is interesting to note Hartshorne's suggestion that this statement should not be taken too seriously. He contends that "Whitehead is not essentially or without far-reaching qualifications committed to the view that occasions are more funda- mental than enduring individuals (i.e., a society)." (Whitehead's idea of God, The Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead, P. A. Schilpp, Ed., p. 547). (Material in brackets mine.) Despite the arguments which Hartshorne offers in support of his contention, Whitehead's position seems to support the quoted statement concerning the "final" reality of actual entities. (See a discussion of the meaning of the term "final" in: A. H. Johnson, The Social Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead, The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. XL (1943), p. 267.) 41 M. T., p. 228. 244</page><page sequence="9">WHITEHEAD S THEORY OF ACTUAL ENTITIES in its nature;42 (d) becomes vWhat it is as the result of its subjective reactions to the data provided by its environment; (e) selects data from its environment in accordance with a conceived ideal. According to Whitehead the characteristics noted in the foregoing analysis are present in all actual entities. In other words, when Whitehead uses the technical term actual entity (or actual occasion)43 he is referring to the sort of entity which is ordinarily called a "subject" or "self".44 As a matter of fact, both terms, subject and actual entity are used by Whitehead as synonyms. Whitehead uses other technical terms to replace those more commonly employed. For example, the process by which an actual entity reacts to its environment is called prehension.45 If the actual entity prehends an abstract idea or ideal this is called conceptual prehension. Conceptual prehensions constitute the mental pole of an actual entity. If an actual entity is reacting to another concrete actual entity, this is called physical prehension. Physical prehensions constitute the physical pole of an actual entity.46 The term data is applied to the contents or materials which are pre- hended.47 These data are also called potentialities.48 The term feeling is used as a synonym for either physical or conceptual prehension.49 An actual entity builds itself up by its prehensions of data. This general process of grasping data into the life of a newly rising actual entity is called concrescence.50 When the process has been completed Whitehead speaks of the attainment of satis- faction.5 The attitude which is taken toward a prehended datum is called 42 Whitehead points out that in contemporary physical science there is a strong tendency to displace the notion that ultimate reality is completely atomic-each bit of reality self- sufficient and exclusive. "The modern point of view is expressed in terms of energy, activity and the vibratory differentiations of space-time. Any local agitation shakes the whole universe. The distant effects are minute but they are there.-The environment enters into the nature of each thing." (M. T., p. 188.) Thus for modern physics, a thing is not an inert mass occupying a certain definite space. A thing is what it does, a stream of influence which permeates to the utmost recesses of space-time. It is evident that when we speak of a thing being specifically located at a certain place we refer only to its focal region. Whitehead's point of view is supported by W. H. Sheldon when he remarks: "There may well be in nature, inorganic as well as living, a slow tendency to combine more and more of what seem to us now, or have seemed, to be incompatible conditions. Liquid air, fire that feeds on water, the fusing of proton and electron in the sun, offer suggestive instances. Particularly the notion of statistical laws inclines in the same direction; as if nature had an intrinsic tendency to vary in all possible ways in any given situation." We could also point to the "Mendelian" facts of heredity where the various possible combina- tions of genes seem to recur. There is, then, a body of decidedly specific evidence in favor of "Whitehead's thesis of incremental process in the inorganic realm: and he might well have used more of this evidence than he did."

JOHNSON subjective form.52 As has been noted, according to Whitehead, the actual entity in its process of development is guided by an ideal or abstract pattern. These ideals, regarded as general possibilities, are called eternal objects.53 This teleologi- cal aspect of the behavior of an actual entity is called the subjective aim.54 Thus Whitehead's impressive list of technical verbiage is simply a group of terms which apply to various phases of ordinary human experience, terms which White- head believes are more adequate than those usually employed for the purpose. In order to understand Whitehead's discussion of an actual entity the meaning of these technical terms must be kept clearly in mind. As discussion proceeds the meaning will be further clarified. ETERNAL OBJECTS Eternal objects are synonomously designated-"Pure Potentials for the Spe- cific Determination of Fact, or Forms of Definiteness."55 In an attempt to clarify his meaning Whitehead states: "Any entity whose conceptual recognition does not involve a necessary reference to any definite actual entities of the temporal world is called an 'eternal object'."56 In other words, the type of entity, apprehended by reason, which in the past has been called a "universal"57 or a "Platonic idea" or "abstract idea" is given a new label by Whitehead- "eternal object". Das seeks to show that Whitehead is involved in great difficulty by his dis- cussion of eternal objects. "Eternal objects are... described as forms of definiteness. Everything actual is definite.... If we still think of an eternal object as a mere possible, we have to say that possibility is the form of actuality. But the terms in such a statement hardly convey any consistent meaning. -The idea of possibility seems to be different from that of definiteness."-58 A careful consideration of Whitehead's position indicates that Das' difficulty is a pseudo one. Whitehead is not identifying possibility and actuality as Das seems to charge. There is obviously a difference between definite, concrete reality and the pattern (form) of definiteness which is manifest in that definite concrete reality. This is the distinction which Whitehead actually makes. Whitehead is concerned to show that eternal objects have a "relational es- sence". "The relationships of (eternal object) A to other eternal objects stand determinately in the essence of A.-They are internal relations."59 That is to say, if you try to consider an eternal object in absolute isolation from other 62 P.

It should be noted that Whitehead also uses the term "universal" in a rather confused fashion-confusing in the sense that it is unusual: P. R., p. 76. However, it is understandable, and hardly merits Stebbings' comment, Mind, Vol. XXXIX (1930), p. 471. 68 Das, pp. 183-4. 69 S. M. W., p. 230 (material in brackets mine). 246</page><page sequence="11">WHITEHEAD'S THEORY OF ACTUAL ENTITIES eternal objects, you miss one of its essential characteristics-that it is related to other eternal objects. Das is guilty of a second mistaken critical comment concerning Whitehead's theory of eternal objects. He argues that since Whitehead claims "each of them occupies a definite place in the realm of eternal objects, and is supposed to be internally related to all the rest-then it appears impossible to isolate one eternal object from all others, so that when an actual thing exemplifies one eternal object, it will have to exemplify all others as well."60 This difficulty is not legitimately involved in Whitehead's position. His point of view is based on a description of human experience. It is quite possible for a person to exemplify one abstract idea in one's behavior without thereby exemplifying all abstract ideas. For example, a person can tell the truth without necessarily exemplifying the number three at the same time. Whitehead contends that eternal objects do not subsist in splendid and self- sufficient isolation. Because of their presence in God's primordial nature (see later discussion) they have a locus in actuality and there is a continuous tendency toward their realization. Thus he states that "in the essence of any eternal object there is a 'patience' for relationship to actual entities; yet any eternal object is indeterminate as to particular ingression."6' The relation between eternal objects and actual entities is designated by various terms. An actual entity may conceptually prehend an eternal object. When an eternal object is more intimately included in the life of an actual entity it is said to "have ingression into", "be realized in",62 or "be exemplified in".63 The meaning of these three terms is apparently the same.64 According to Whitehead, eternal objects are either simple or complex. Typical simple eternal objects are those designated by the words whiteness, hardness, sweetness, man, army, drunkenness.65 "A definite finite relationship involving the definite eternal objects of a limited set of such objects is itself a (complex) eternal object."66 An apparent problem arises when we find Whitehead stating that "sensa', 60 Das, p. 184. 61 S. M. W., pp. 230-1. 62 P. R., p. 34. 63 P. R., p. 63. 64 The platonic term "participation" is also used. "The things which are temporal arise by their participation in the things which are eternal". (P. R., p. 63.) It has been claimed (see, for example, Emmet, p. 106) that Whitehead's doctrine of eternal objects is very similar to Plato's theory of "ideas". It is true that there is some similarity. Both refer to abstract entities which must be apprehended by reason. They are not objects of sensory experience. However, Whitehead stresses several fundamental differences which serve to distinguish his eternal objects from Plato's ideas. (The reference is to Plato's theory of ideas as expressed in The Republic, Phaedo, and Phaedrus) (a) Plato's ideas have no necessary relationship to the concrete world of actual entities. Whitehead's eternal objects are essentially related to actual entities. (b) Plato's ideas are assigned the exalted status of sole reality. For Whitehead actual entities are the ultimate realities. 65 P. R., p. 82. 66 S. M. W., p. 239. 247</page><page sequence="12">A. H. JOHNSON constitute the lowest category of eternal objects."67 There are also references to the sensuous apprehenson of eternal objects. This seems completely con- trary to the previously noted contention that eternal objects are apprehended by reason and not by the senses. This difficulty can be cleared up by noting that Whitehead apparently has been careless in his use of language. What he really means to say is this: The eternal object, as such, is conceptually prehended. A particular exemplification of this eternal object is sensuously apprehended. Thus, when Whitehead refers to the sensuous apprehension of an eternal object, he should have referred, more accurately to the sensuous apprehension of an exemplification of the eternal object. For example, we rationally apprehend (conceptual prehension) "tri- plicity". We sensuously apprehend three mice. We rationally apprehend "greenness"; we sensuously apprehend, not the eternal object greenness, but its exemplification-the patch of green present before our eyes as a visual sensum. Hooper seems to be involved in a misunderstancing of Whitehead's position at this point (due probably to Whitehead's carelessness noted above). He states: "Eternal objects, then, are such transcendent entities as shapes, colours, sounds, smells, touches, tastes, apprehended by means of the senses.... (Strangely enough the rest of his statement is correct.) They also include . . . the entities revealed by untrue but significant propositions and by 'ideals'."68 This mis- taken notion is particularly surprising in view of Hooper's preliminary statement that Plato's doctrine of "Ideas" corresponds closely to Whitehead's doctrine of "eternal objects" and on the well-known point that Plato's Ideas are appre- hended by reason and not by sense.69 This same misunderstanding is apparently the basis of Sellars' seriously mistaken comment that "an actual occasion is con- stituted out of universals, . . . a concrete and not an abstract, universal."70 One phase of Whitehead's discussion of eternal objects involves a distinction between "objective species" and "subjective species". This differentiation is made on the basis of the mode of ingression of eternal objects into actual entities. 'Any eternal object is objective if it is exemplified in the datum of a prehension (feeling). Any eternal object is "subjective" if it is an element in the subjective form of some prehension. This simple, matter of fact, differentiation has led critics to claim that Whitehead is setting up a hard and fast distinction between two types of eternal objects.7' As a matter of fact, the distinction is only functional. "The (any) eternal object can then function both subjectively and relatively (objectively). It can be a private element in a subjective form, and also an agent in the objectification."72 In view of the preceding discussion there seems to be no justification for Emmet's suggestion that only the objective 67 P.

But after all do not modes of feeling manifest specific forms of definite- ness, in other words are not eternal objects therein exemplified? One of the most fundamental criticisms of Whitehead's theory of eternal objects is advanced by Dewey when he suggests that instead of regarding eternal objects (universals) as independent and ready made, they should be recognized as generalized suggestions which emerge in the course of human experience and are used to solve human problems.74 This is called the "genetic-functional" approach to the problem of generalities. Whitehead's reply, in the form of a specific illustration, indicates his reason for declining to agree with Dewey. "No explosion of any star can generate the multiplication table by any genetic- functioning. But such functioning does exemplify interrelations of number."75 If it be objected that this reply dodges the issue-after all Dewey referred to human generalization and Whitehead mentions the explosion of a star-it must be remembered that Whitehead's reason for referring to eternal objects is that he claims to have direct and unmistakable experience of them. PREHENSIONS As has been noted, actual entities are analyzable into their component pre- hensions, either physical or conceptual. "Every prehension consists of three factors: (a) the 'subject' which is prehending, namely, the actual entity in which the prehension is a concrete element; (b) the 'datum' which is prehended; (c) the 'subjective form' which is how that subject prehends that datum."76 A positive prehension is one in which data are accepted into the being of a new entity. A negative prehension is one in which the data are considered, but re- jected. However, the subjective form of the negative prehension is part of the constituent content of the actual entity even though the datum is rejected. In this sense a negative prehension is said to constitute a bond of relationship.77 Lintz's discussion of negative prehension is erroneous when he states: "Certain elements remain . .. but they are not of importance for the process."78 His error is due to the fact that Whitehead means what he says when he claims that data are rejected. 73 Emmet, p. 133. 74 John Dewey, Whitehead's Philosophy, The Philosophical Review, Vol. XLVI (1937), pp. 175-6. 75 A. N. Whitehead, Remarks, The Philosophical Review, Vol. XLVI (1937), p. 179. 76 p. R., p. 35. It is important to note that in formulating his theory of prehension, Whitehead acknowledges a debt to Bradley. He states "It is interesting to make a few citations from Bradley illustrating my general adherence to his doctrine of Feeling." (A. I., p. 297.) He then proceeds to show how he accepts Bradley's analysis but prefers to use different technical terms. 77 P. R., p. 66. 78 E. J.

JOHNSON Ushenko's examination of negative prehensions raises an important critical point. "A datum of negative prehension is eliminated from feeling and, there- fore, is not felt; yet as a datum it must be given and, therefore, in some sense must be felt."79 It should be noted that this difficulty can be easily resolved if one remembers that Whitehead uses the term "feeling" in a highly technical sense. He does not mean "awareness". He means the process of inclusion in the final satisfaction of an actual entity. The initial data, present to a newly arising actual entity, which are not included in the final satisfaction, are, speaking technically, not felt.80 Another interesting point raised by Ushenko is the suggestion that elimination (negative prehension) may take two forms, (i) active rejection; (ii) passive impenetrability. Ushenko claims to find evidence that Whitehead favors both methods of elimination. However, it must be remembered that for Whitehead an actual entity is what it does.81 It, therefore, seems difficult indeed to find any Whiteheadian actual entity maintaining passive anaesthesia. True, an actual entity might make itself immune to the influence of data from other actual entities, but this for Whitehead would be one of the constitutive activities of the actual entity in question. It must not be forgotten that Whitehead con- tends that "All actual entities in the actual world, relatively to a given actual entity as 'subject', are necessarily 'felt' by that subject, though in general vaguely. -Only a selection of eternal objects is 'felt' by a given subject."82 In describing the origination of an actual entity by means of its (physical) prehensions of other actual entities, Whitehead uses the terms "datum" or "data" and "objectification". The meaning of the former term is clear from the preceding discussion. Other actual entities provide materials (data) for inclusion in the new actual entities which are continually arising. (It is to be recalled that the term data is also applied to eternal objects.) The meaning of the term objectification is indicated thus: "The functioning of one actual entity (through the medium of the data which it provides) in the self-creation of another actual entity is the 'objectification' of the former for the latter."83 Whitehead contends that the data of physical prehensions consist of concrete components of actual entities. This material undergoes a literal transfer. It ceases to be a component of one actual entity. By the process of objectification it becomes a component of another, different, actual entity. "The primitive form of physical experience is emotional-blind emotion-received as felt elsewhere in another occasion and conformally appropriated as a subjective passion."84 Whitehead bases this doctrine on the observed fact that when a person is angry the anger continues, 79 A.

Morris's comment: "But division into prehensions .. .seems to yield an atomism at odds with aesthetic experience."87 Surely Whitehead's emphasis on the essential inter-relatedness of actual entities, through the medium of pre- hension, constitutes a thorough-going denial of the exclusive atomism of tradi- tional physics and "association" psychology. It is very important to notice the type of relationship which holds between a prehending and a prehended actual entity. In the case of a physical prehension of actual entity "B" by actual entity "A"-data for prehension into "A" are available only after the internal existence of actual entity "B" has "evaporated, worn out and satisfied."88 It is as though one man "B" gives a pint of blood to another man "A", thus making possible the existence of "A". But the transaction can only occur if it is preceded by the demise of "B". This theory of Whitehead's is summarized in the statement: "Actual entities 'perpetually perish' subjectively, (they are no longer "living", concrete, active subjects) but are immortal objectively."89 (Part of their content is taken over into other subsequent actual entities. Thus they obtain "objective immortality."90) Hooper seems strangely oblivious to this point when he states: "Since the simple physical feeling is the feeling of the actual entity which is the 'cause', and because a cause's feeling cannot, as a feeling, be abstracted from its own subject, the subject of the cause (a) enters into the new effect (b). That is to say, the feeling from the cause (a) acquires the subjectivity of the new effect (b) without loss of its own original subjectivity in the cause."91 It must be admitted that on at least one occasion Whitehead seems to hold that position.92 However this is entirely contrary to the general tenor of his discussion and the particular statement in question is so general as to be ambiguous. McGilvary also overlooks the same essential point, missed by Hooper, when he suggests that a " 'concrescent occasion' has, therefore, the good fortune of 85 A. I., pp. 235-6. 86 Whitehead claims that the essentials of his theory of prehension were noted but not stressed by previous thinkers. For example, Berkeley in Alciphron (fourth dialogue) has Euphanor pointing out to Alciphron: "It is, therefore, aspects of the castle, the cloud, and the planet (distant in space) which are grasped into unity (by the percipient occasion) here." S. M. W., p. 102 (material in brackets mine). Thus Whitehead seems to think that Berkeley recognizes that perception involves a transfer of content-the sort of process which Whitehead calls prehension. 87 Bertram Morris, The Art-process and the Aesthetic Fact in Whitehead's Philosophy, The Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead (P.

JOHNSON being able as it were both to eat its cake and have it. The actual occasion ingests all its cakes into its own 'inner constitution' and also leaves them out where they were before."93 The process of objectification which occurs in physical prehension does not involve an exact or a complete transfer of content from the old to the new actual entity. "The cause (the preceding actual entity) passes on its feeling to be reproduced by the new subject as its own .... But the re-enaction is not per- fect."94 Only some of the components are transferred in the process of objectifi- cation. "There are factors in the environment which are eliminated from any function as explicit facts in the new creation. The running stream purifies it- self."95 This is the point involved in Whitehead's distinction between "initial data" (the world of actual entities in all its rich complexity) and "objective data" (the content selected for inclusion in a new actual entity).96 Gentry, in discussing objective immortality apparently disregards the point that this process involves loss. He refers to actual entities as "recurrent particu- lars."97 However when he points out that "objectification and prehension are abstractive, eliminative operations",98 he is offering a more accurate statement.99 A further confusion in Gentry's discussion is his suggestion that the chief efficacy of an objective datum is that it arouses "a'subjective response, through its generation of an affective tone of determinate pattern and character, which in substance reproduces its own pattern and character,-its relevance through its provocation of a determinate affective tone constitutes its major relevance to a given concrescence."100 Having developed this mistaken notion, Gentry on numerous occasions states the correct point of view-namely, that prehension involves literal transfer of content from one actual entity to another.l10 Gentry attempts to convict Whitehead of three different approaches to this problem. Actual entities in prehending (i) are concerned with each other; (ii) appropriation takes place; (iii) transference occurs.l02 As a matter of fact, this is merely an instance of Whitehead saying the same thing in three different ways, as a careful reading of the relevant passage will clearly indicate. Gentry raises an interesting critical point concerning physical prehension when he states "The entity as a whole is included in feeling by means of one of its elements although the remainder of its constituents are excluded from feeling. 93 E.

This is how the process is observed to occur, even though, apparently, Gentry would prefer to have it otherwise. It must be noted that Gentry's discussion of organic interaction, causation and perception (Parts IV and V of The Philosophy of A. N. Whitehead) is unnecessarily complicated by an unjustified distinction which he introduces into Whitehead's philosophical system. He contends that "when Whitehead is dealing... with the assumption that actualities are literal constituents in each other's natures, he has,-two explanations of the posited immanence of actualities, e.g., causal objectification and feeling or prehension. In other words, he has two categories in terms of which he accounts for the immanence of existing things."104 Causal objectification, also called "efficient cause"105 involves an external approach the process of interaction. Feeling or prehension involves an internal, experi- ential, subjective approach to this process.106 Causal objectification involves repetition of content; feeling or prehension involves introduction of novelty. The main fallacy in this attempted analysis of Whitehead's position is that causal objectification is simply a phase of physical prehension. "The functioning of one actual entity in the self-creation of another actual entity is the 'objectifi- cation' of the former for the latter."107-"An actual entity as felt (positively prehended) is said to be 'objectified' for that subject."108 Further, it is to be noted that Gentry's distinction between causal objectifi- cation and prehension in terms of external and internal approaches, is not correct. Whitehead's philosophy employs experiential (inner) concepts in all phases. Indeed Gentry himself admits that a discussion of causal objectification involves a reference to "satisfaction" and "feeling".'09 Gentry's contention that novelty in actual entities is accounted for in terms of the experiential approach rather than in terms of causal objectification is care- lessly expressed. At one point he states that the experiential approach is the theory of physical prehension.1" Earlier in the discussion Gentry suggest that the experiential approach emphasizes both physical and conceptual pre- hension.l11 It has been suggested that only eternal objects are exposed to negative pre- hension.12 However, it should be obvious that at least some concrete phases of 103 Gentry, p. 191. 104 Gentry, p, 120. 105 Gentry, p. 129. 106 See Gentry, pp. 138-9. 107 P.

JOHNSON other actual entities, while perhaps present as initial data, are rejected and hence do not appear as objective data, do not appear in the final satisfaction. Indeed, Whitehead makes this point very clear when he points out that a complex positive prehension involves five factors: "(i) the 'subject' which feels, (ii) the 'initial data' which are felt, (iii) the 'elimination' in virtue of negative prehensions, (iv) the 'objective datum' which is felt, (v) the subjective form which is how that subject feels that objective datum.""13 The objection has been offered that Whitehead involves himself in hopeless confusion-having distinguished between positive and negative prehension, he proceeds to make negative prehension a part of positive prehension.l4 But after all Whitehead is interested in reporting the facts. Is it not true that, in some complex situations, the adding of content to the experience of a subject involves some elimination of available data? A strange misinterpretation of Whitehead's theory of negative prehension is provided by Dunham. He argues that since Leibnitz accounted for individuali- zation by a materia prima and since negative prehension provides for individuali- zation, therefore Whitehead has, "in terms of its negative prehensions an entity strikingly like the material body of Newtonian cosmology, with its external rela- tions and its absolute space and time.-Even more striking is the negatively prehended objects resemblance to the exclusive, feelingless, utterly incompatible material object of popular conception."15 This comment overlooks the basic fact that actual entities, whether positively or negatively prehended are not as such exclusive, and feelingless. Thus Dunham's charge that Whitehead intro- duces materialism into his animistic system is obviously incorrect. On the basis of the preceding discussion it is possible to provide an answer to the objection raised by Stace. "If actual entity A prehends actual entity B, then B's feelings are in A, and B itself is in A. If he asserts numerical identity then his doctrine is self-contradictory, for the definition of numerical identity must include absence of spatial separation. If he does not assert numerical identity, then his doctrine that 'everything is everywhere' is (to use one of his own favorite expressions) a 'fake'.""6 As has been noted, Whitehead does not claim that B, in its entirety, is in A, further-there is a "time lag" between B and A. Preceding discussion also serves to indicate that Hartshorne involves himself in a strange difficulty when he states: "since it cannot be the eternal objects, nor the events as constituted by them, which internally involve other actual events, therefore the solidarity of the world, with its corollorary, the denial of simple location, can only mean that the bare space-time locus of each event involves reference to the loci of other events. Qualitatively, events remain outside each other. I confess to a virtual certainty that this is not Whitehead's meaning."l7 13 P. R., pp. 337-8. 114 See Lintz, p. 59; Gentry, p. 189. 115 A. M.

This content manifests (or is), certain common eternal objects. The validity of this theory of physical prehension can be shown very simply, according to Whitehead. Is it not true that we are aware of feelings being trans- ferred from past occasions of experience; for example, a feeling of anger? The past occasions of experience are "no more", but an essential component is pre- served in the present moment of experience. We still feel the anger which an insulting remark aroused two minutes ago. That past occasion has faded; unless it had occurred and then faded from existence the present moment of experience could not now exist. This is the type of evidence on which Whitehead bases the descriptive generalization now under consideration. It must be remembered that the process of objectification is not due entirely to the prehensive activity of the newly arising actual entity. The actual entities which in their "passing" provide data have a drive or urge to make contributions to the new actual entities.118 Thus, in this sense, the data are not passively available. There are several passages in Whitehead's writings which seem to imply a theory of objectification and prehension different from the one outlined in the paragraphs. Whitehead states, for example-"An eternal object when it has ingression through the function of objectifying the actual world, so as to present the datum for prehension, is functioning datively."l9 "...the eternal objects function by introducing the multiplicity of actual entities as constitutive of the actual entity in question."120 Such passages as these have led critics to hold that the only bond between successive actual entities is the eternal object which they prehend in common. This interpretation is apparently supported by reference to Whitehead's discussion of the relational functioning of eternal objects on which the solidarity of the universe is based.12' However, in considering such statements, it must be remembered that in all instances Whitehead is apparently discussing the transfer of concrete content. It is, therefore, not to be thought that the eternal objects are the most important elements in the process, nor the only content of the bridge between actual entities. By virtue of the process of physical prehension, the same eternal object appears in two successive actual entities. The prehensive connection between actual entities in most cases (hybrid-physical prehensions constitute an exception) is not due primarily to the fact of the presence of the same eternal object in the two actual entities. As a matter of fact, the eternal object is present in the two actual entities simply because there has been a transfer of content from one actual entity to another. The content manifests the eternal object. The process by which the content is transferred constitutes the linkage.l22 118 P. R., pp. 133-4. 119 P. R., p. 249. 120 P. R., p. 93. 121 P.

JOHNSON It is to be noted that the process by which an eternal object functions in the growth of a newly arising actual entity is very complex. First of all there is conceptual prehension. That is to say, the actual entity is "aware of" the eternal object as a pattern which may be exemplified in the experience of the actual entity. If this pattern is rejected as an unsuitable "form of definiteness" negative prehension has occurred. If it is retained in the focus of interest, this state is called conceptual prehension. The eternal object thus is a component of the actual entity prehending it. It is positively prehended. The process by which an eternal object is embodied in the life of a new actual entity, more completely than by conceptual prehension, is called ingression or exemplification or realization.l23 This distinction between ingression and conceptual prehension is a very important one. It is the difference between concentration on the ab- stract notion of "three", and the concrete manifestation of this notion in, say, three actual specific feelings. This ingression occurs because some actual entity (or group of actual entities) has conceptually prehended the eternal object three and decided to exemplify it in its experience. This point is apparently overlooked by Gentry who states: "Eternal objects are implicated in the existent world in virtue of being conceptually prehended, . . . (conceptual) prehension is the principle of ingression."124 Whitehead's discussion of prehension involves a reference not only to physical, conceptual, positive and negative prehensions. He also considers so-called "hybrid physical prehensions". "A 'physical feeling' is here defined to be the feeling of another actuality. If the other actuality be objectified by its con- ceptual feelings, the physical feeling of the subject in question is termed 'hy- brid'."125 In her examination of hybrid physical prehensions Emmet, while stating the theory correctly, is unfortunate in the example which she uses. "If I feel the tree as green I am feeling the tree as prehending conceptually the eternal object green."'26 In this attempted illustration Emmet has overlooked the distinction (noted in a preceding paragraph) between the conceptual prehension of an eternal object and the exemplification of that eternal object. Strictly speaking, if the tree (its component actual entities) had only a conceptual prehension of greenness it would not be actually green in color. The tree would not be green until it had exemplified the conceptually prehended eternal object, "greenness". As such, the eternal object is not colored, i.e., it does not possess the sort of quality which is sensuously apprehended. However, it should be pointed out that Emmet does, in another attempt, mention an adequate example of a hybrid physical prehension: "in feeling eternal objects we are having hybrid physical prehensions of God."127 (See later discussion of God for a clarification of this point.) White- 123 See P. R., pp. 34, 63. It is to be noted that sometimes Whitehead uses the term realization, not in the sense of ingression, but rather in the sense of conceptual prehension. (P.

That is to say ideas (eternal objects) conceptually prehended by one mind (a "high grade" actual entity) are shared by another mind without any apparent transfer of concrete content, or concrete medium of communication.128 SUBJECTIVE FORM The subjective form is how a subject prehends a datum. There are many species of subjective forms, such as emotions, valuations, purposes, adversions and aversions, consciousness. Horror, disgust, indignation and enjoyment of a joke are specific illustrations.l29 One might assume that in Whitehead's opinion all actual entities would of necessity have consciousness present, otherwise how could horror or enjoyment be an experienced component. Further, it might be assumed that any conceptual prehension must have consciousness as its subjective form. This, however, is not the case. According to Whitehead, consciousness is only one type of sub- jective form. Indeed, it is not present at all in the experience of most actual entities. In order to understand Whitehead at this point it must be remembered that he uses the term consciousness in a very special and restricted sense. It is not synonymous with "aware of". "Consciousness-is the feeling of contrast of theory, as mere theory, with fact, as mere fact."130 The mere awareness of fact or theory is not enough to make possible the presence of consciousness. The factor of contrast is basic. Whitehead contends that all conceptual prehensions have "valuation" as their subjective form. In the case of a simple conceptual prehension, where only one eternal object is involved, it is merely a case of an attitude of approval or dis- approval. However, in the case of a complex conceptual feeling the subject is faced with several eternal objects. These must be arranged in order of im- portance with reference to the subjective aim of that subject. On the basis of this standard each eternal object is approved or disapproved in varying degrees. Whitehead's theory of "subject form" is one of the most widely understood phases of his general position. Blyth is apparently unique in his amazingly inaccurate statement that "these subjective forms or characteristics of feelings are what Whitehead has termed 'eternal objects."' 31 SUBJECTIVE AIM The factor of aim or purpose is a basic element in all actual entities. Accord- ing to Whitehead "the determinate unity of an actual entity is bound together by the final causation toward an ideal-. The ideal, itself felt; defines what 'self' 128 S. E.

Hereafter this book will be referred to as "Blyth". 257</page><page sequence="22">A. H. JOHNSON shall arise from the datum." The ideal has this power because it is prehended by the subject with the subjective form of "purpose to realize it."132 Wahl assigns excessive importance to the function of eternal objects, apparently dis- regarding the essential initiative of the actual entity as such. For example: "Les objects eternels sont a la fois cause de l'unite et de la s6paration des 6vene- ments."'33 It is to be noted that Whitehead uses the phrase "subjective aim" in two different meanings, though in both cases he is stressing the notion of im- manent teleology. On some occasions, by subjective aim, he seems to mean the "act of aiming at", or "proposing to achieve" the ideal goal. On other occasions he seems to mean not the act of aiming but rather the goal aimed at. There is a further subtle distinction between the goal as an ideal and the goal as (later) actualized.134 Whitehead apparently, on occasion, assigns to subjective form the function usually attributed to subjective aim. For example: "If Bradley is stating that the subjective forms of feelings determine the process of integration, I entirely agree."'35 However, careful reading of the context indicates that this statement involved a careless use of the term "subjective form". What he is really saying is that the final satisfaction determines the process of integration. Thus the doctrine of subjective aim is not superseded. Whitehead contends that the subjective aim does not necessarily remain un- changed during the "epoch" required for the completion of an actual entity. The "subjective aim, in its successive modifications, remains the unifying fac- tor";136 for example, an artist who, in producing a picture, has in mind a basic plan. However, the details are modified during the process of his work. Coolidge seems to be the victim of a misunderstanding when she attempts to indicate a similarity between Kant and Whitehead with reference to a theory of "purposiveness without purpose". Her argument is that if Whitehead is to attribute genuine creativity and emergence to an actual entity, the goal "the somewhere" toward which the creative process is tending cannot be defined.'37 This is not in accordance with Whitehead's actual point of view. He contends, as has been indicated in the preceding discussion, that unless there is a definite subjective aim (true, some of the details may be modified) creative development does not occur. Gentry falls into serious error when he contends: "the statement of the inte- grative character of concrescence in terms of the notion of 'final cause' consti- tutes no solution of the problem of a principle of integration, i.e. no explanation of the organic character of the process. So much Whitehead recognizes."l38 It is, of course, absurd to append to this criticism of Whitehead the statement: 32 P.

Contrary to Gentry's claim, Whitehead be- lieves that the notion of final cause does explain the organic character of process. He holds that this doctrine is simply a description of what actually occurs. Further, in terms of human envisagement and realization of ideals, Whitehead does show how the effective immanence of a possibility may be achieved. The preceding analysis of the essential components of actual entities must be supplemented by a consideration of several other phases of Whitehead's theory. It is to be noted that one of the basic characteristics of an actual entity is that it is "causa sui". "It is finally responsible for the decision by which any lure for feeling is admitted to efficiency."139 No datum can force itself, or be forced, into the experience of any actual entity. Obviously, Hughes is incorrect when he claims that, for Whitehead, "causation is limited to causation of the coercive, compulsive type, in which consequences are 'explained' because they are necessitated by their antecedents. He overlooks the perceptual basis of our concept of factors observed as essentials in a co- operative, contemporary causation; nor does he recognize the perceptual basis of our concept of 'final' causation."'40 The first part of Hughes' criticism is refuted in the preceding paragraph. The last part of the criticism has been dealt with in the discussion of subjective aim. Whitehead contends that both final141 and efficient causation are manifest within the experience of each actual entity. These two types of causation are inherent characteristics of each actual entity. His use of the term "efficient cause" is a rather specialized and technical one. "The 'objectifications' of the actual entities in the actual world, relative to a definite actual entity, constitute the efficient causes out of which that actual entity arises."'42 Lintz objects that the "data" provided by the actual world should be termed "material cause" rather than "efficient cause". This point is well taken if the "Aristotelian" approach is to be accepted. Also relevant and useful is his argument143 that the self-creative activity of an actual entity manifests efficient causation (if the term is used in its ordinary sense). However, in the course of his discussion, Lintz criticizes Whitehead for not recognizing that the end or final cause must be immanent in the efficient cause. (The term efficient cause is used in Whitehead's technical sense.) Going further, he opposes the notion of "causa sui" as applied to an actual entity. It is claimed that this notion is not in accordance with the truth. (In the opinion of Lintz the "truth" is to be found in the traditional position of Roman Catholicism.) Whitehead states that "the 'subjective aim'"at 'satisfaction' constitutes the final cause, or lure, whereby there is determinate concrescence."144 Obviously, then, Lintz is incorrect when he suggests that Whitehead "fails to note-that 139 P.

Hereafter this article will be referred to as "Hughes". 141 See preceding discussion of "subjective aim". 142 P. R., p. 134. 143 Lintz, pp. 11-13. 144 P. R., p. 134. 259</page><page sequence="24">A. H. JOHNSON the end (final cause) moves the agent to action."14' Lintz is guilty of a series of misunderstandings of Whitehead's position which seem to stem from his dis- regard of the theory of subjective aim and the self-creative nature of actual entities. He contends that "order comes from the data themselves as of them- selves."'46 A subsequent statement is marked by an amazing amount of con- fusion: "Just as the subject is the efficient cause of its own becoming, so the incompatible data are the cause of their own unification into one datum."147 Gentry's discussion of cause involves the mistaken notion that the actual entity which provides data is the "ultimate cause".148 This, of course, is ridicu- lous in the view of the autonomy exercised by each newly arising actual entity. The nature of this autonomy must be carefully noted. Each actual entity is autonomous in that it is free to select from the data provided, in whatever pos- sible way it sees fit. It is to be realized, of course, that an actual entity cannot "conjure up" data which are not available. In the sense that an actual entity can only use data available and react to it in certain "determined" possible ways (though there is a very wide range of choice)-it is limited and conditioned by that data. Thus, "there is no such fact as absolute freedom; every actual entity possesses only such freedom, as is inherent in the primary phase 'given' by its standpoint of relativity to its actual universe."149-All this must be born in mind when one reads Whitehead's statement: "The freedom inherent in the universe is constituted by this element of self-causation" (of actual entities).150 A general discussion of the problem of fredom involves a reference to White- head's controversial theory of the "complete contemporary freedom" of actual entities. The situation in which complete contemporary freedom arises is that in which two or more actual entities do not immediately prehend each other. This seems impossible to some of Whitehead's critics in view of his contention that all actual entities prehend each other.'5' However, a careful consideration of the details of Whitehead's metaphysics indicates that this doctrine of complete contemporary freedom does not involve him in hopeless contradiction and con- fusion. It must be remembered that if actual entity "a" is to be objectified in actual entity "b", "a" must be past with reference to "b", past and gone (as an actual entity), otherwise no data would be available for physical prehension (as will be noted, God is an exception). It is, therefore, impossible, on the basis of Whitehead's system, for two ordinary actual entities which are contem- porary, i.e. each in the process of self-creation at the same time, to provide data for each other. The fact is that they have not reached the stage in the ca- reer of an actual entity when it makes data available. Hartshorne seems to overlook this point when he contends that Whitehead cannot legitimately, within the assumptions of his system, exclude contempo- raries from the bonds of direct prehension. "The unqualified inclusiveness of 146 Lintz, p. 13 (material in brackets mine). 146 Lintz, p. 51. 147 Lintz, p. 59. 148 Gentry, p. 157. 149 P. R., p. 202. 160 P.

In opposition to this objection it must be remembered, as pointed out above, that in Whitehead's system contemporaries cannot have direct prehension of each other. The term "monad" used by Hartshorne in this connection is unfortunate because of its implication of exclusiveness. The contemporary freedom of actual entities does not involve Whitehead in the difficulty pointed out by Bradley. The relationship of prehension is for Whitehead one of the basic observable facts in the universe. It is the relationship of actual entities. In the opinion of Whitehead, Bradley's problem is a pseudo problem if the facts of experience are taken seriously. Further, it should be noted that contemporaries do enjoy a linkage, all be it a rather tenuous one. "Indirectly, via the immanence of the (common) past and the immanence of the (common) future, (even) the (contemporary) occasions are connected."153 Hartshorne suggests a possible relationship between contemporaries due to the mediation of God. "Since they are all immanent in God, and he in turn immanent in them, must they not be immanent in each other?"154 Here again Hartshorne overlooks Whitehead's essential point that contemporaries, since they have not yet achieved satisfaction, have not yet provided data, have not yet entered into the being of God. The preceding discussion provides the basis of an answer to the problem raised by C. W. Morris.l55 He states: "that some actual entities and some eternal objects are not prehended by any particular actual entity." It should be noted that though contemporary actual entities cannot directly prehend each other, since no data are yet ready for prehension, all actual entities in the past of present actual entities are prehended by those present actual entities either positively or negatively. Morris seems to claim that because "givenness (objectification) implies elimination and exclusion, that therefore not all actual entities are related to some other actual entity or entities. It is Whitehead's basic contention that "if we allow for degrees of relevance, and for negligible relevance, we must say that every actual entity is present in every other actual entity."'56 It is im- portant to note that by the term relevance Whitehead means not only positive relevance but also "the zero of relevance involved in a negative prehension."'57 This must be borne in mind while reading Whitehead's statement that "any item 162 Charles Hartshorne, On Some Criticisms of Whitehead's Philosophy, The Philosophi- cal Review, Vol. XLIV (1935), p. 334. 153 A.

JOHNSON in the universe, however preposterous as an abstract thought, or however remote as an actual entity, has its own gradation of relevance, as prehended, in the constitution of any one actual entity."'58 Having indicated that both positive and negative prehension are the bonds which link actual entities together, Whitehead apparently shifts his ground and contends that "an actual entity in the actual world of a subject must enter into the concresence of that subject by some simple causal feeling, however vague, trivial, and submerged... in some way, by some trace of causal feeling the remote actual entity is prehended positively."'59 The phrase "actual world" has a technical meaning which is rather difficult to grasp. There seem to be various actual worlds. Thus Whitehead states that there is "an indetermination respecting the actual world which is to decide the conditions for the immediately novel concrescence."'l0 Whitehead clarifies his meaning by suggesting that the actual world of any actual entity is "a nexus whose objectification constitutes the complete unity of the objective datum for the physical feeling of that actual entity."'16 Thus the term actual world seems to mean the actual entities then available for prehension. There are many actual worlds because of the continual emergence of new actual entities. Thus the actual entities available at T 1 are different from those available at T 2. Whitehead seems to have a somewhat different notion in mind when he sug- gests that "Each actual occasion defines its own actual world from which it originates. No two occasions can have identical actual worlds.""62 The context indicates that by "actual world" Whitehead here means what should be called, more accurately, the perspective from which the newly arising actual entity views the actual world. (The term, actual world, here is being used in the original sense noted above.) In dealing with the influence of actual entities in the distant past, Whitehead suggests that each actual world (a nexus of actual entities) is objectively im- mortal in the actual entity which arises from it, (A. E. 1). When in its turn this actual entity (A. E. 1) is objectified in a newly arising actual entity (A. E. 2) the nexus of actual entities from which A. E. 1 arose is present (in a sense) in A. E. 2 through the mediation of A. E. 1.163 It will be shown in subsequent dis- cussion that for Whitehead, in the sense indicated, future actual entities consti- tute part of the actual world of a newly arising actual entity (as well as past actual entities both those in the immediate past and those in the distant past). Finally, in the tenuous sense indicated in previous discussion present (contempo- rary) actual entities are in the actual world of a newly arising actual entity. It should be obvious from the foregoing that "an actual entity is a process, and is not describable in terms of the morphology of a 'stuff'.-Each actual 158 P. R., p. 224. 169 P.

R., pp. 351-2. 262</page><page sequence="27">WHITEHEAD'S THEORY OF ACTUAL ENTITIES entity is conceived as an act of experience arising out of data. It is a process of 'feeling' the many data, so as to absorb them into the unity of one individual 'satisfaction'."'64 An extremely important phase of Whitehead's position is the claim that "the feeler (subject) is the unity emergent from its own feelings".165 The full implica- tion of this theory is brought out very clearly in a statement by Whitehead. "The philosophies of substance presuppose a subject which then encounters a datum, and then reacts to the datum. The philosophy of organism presupposes a datum which is met with feelings, and progressively attains the unity of a subject."'66 In short, there is no initial self which exists before the process of feeling takes place "For Kant, the world emerges from the subject; for the philosophy of organism, the subject emerges from the world."167 This point of view seems to contradict other statements made by Whitehead. For example, he refers to "the 'subject' which is prehending."168 He claims that "a feeling cannot be abstracted from the actual entity entertaining it."169 In Whitehead's opinion these two apparently contradictory points of view are seen to be consistent when one bears in mind the relationship of a subject to its feelings. Whitehead seems to have two explanations of this relationship, which in the last analysis can be fused together. (a) The subject is the final cause or goal which the feelings (prehensions) strive to attain. "The feelings are in- separable from the end at which they aim; and this end is the feeler."-"It is better to say that the feelings aim at their subject, than to say that they are aimed at their subject."170 (b) The other type of relationship between a subject and its feelings is that the subject is simply the totality of the feelings which together achieve the unity. Thus Whitehead states: "the first analysis of an actual entity, into its most concrete elements, discloses it to be a concrescence of prehensions, which have originated in the process of becoming."'71 White- head fuses these two usages of the term subject by stating: "The word 'subject' means the entity constituted by the process of feeling, and including this process. The feeler is the unity emergent from its own feelings."'72 Hooper is either careless or inaccurate in his discussion of this phase of White- head's position. He states: "The term 'subject' applied to an actual entity is, therefore, to be understood as meaning that there is a central factor which has experience . . .so that an actual entity in its fulness must be regarded as a subject experiencing, and the experiences which it owns."'73 Strangely enough this "substance" notion of the subject (which Whitehead does not hold) is placed 164 P.

JOHNSON side by side, in Hooper's discussion, with a correct statement of Whitehead's position-that the feeler is the unity emergent from its own feelings. Whitehead's theory of actual entities involves him, as he recognizes, in an apparently paradoxical position. The paradox that, although actual entities are the only real things in the universe, yet any actual entity "is always in the process of becoming and perishing and never really is."174 That is to say it never really is, if by existence is meant static endurance. In other words, an actual entity is either constructing itself by taking in data, and is thus not yet a complete actual entity; or, having reached completion it immediately ceases to exist as a self-creating entity and its content becomes available for objectification in some subsequent actual entity. Thus when Whitehead refers to an actual entity he is not designating anything static and unchanging. He is referring either to (a) an entity which is in process of self-creation, or (b) an entity which has just achieved completeness and is about to go out of existence, or (c) it is the case of one actual entity "A" providing data for another actual entity "B". Strictly speaking, in this situation a reference to "A" is a reference to an entity which no longer exists. All that remains is some of the content which once belonged to "A".175 It should be noted, in addition, that (d) it is possible to refer to future actual entities. Whitehead's meaning is made clear in the following quotation: "The future is immanent in the present by reason of the fact that the present bears in its own essence the relationships which it will have to the future. It thereby includes in its essence the necessities to which the future must conform. The future is there in the present, as a general fact belonging to the nature of things. It is also there with such general determinations as it lies in the nature of the particular present to impose on the particular future which must succeed it . . . there are no actual occasions in the future, to exercise efficient causation in the present.-The future belongs to the essence of the present fact, and has no actuality other than the actuality of present fact."176 In an attempt to stress the essentially co-operative nature of actual entities Whitehead suggests that "an actual entity is to be conceived both as a subject presiding over its own immediacy of becoming, and a superject which is the atomic creature177 exercising its function of objective immortality."'78 174 p. R., p. 126. 175 This discussion will perhaps provide at least a partial answer for cricisms offered by Das, pp. 177-183; Lintz, pp. 10, 21; Parker, Experience and Substance, p. 19. In any case Das is obviously not correct when he attributes to Whitehead the doctrine that "an actual entity leaves no remainder when it perishes" (Das, p. 181). Further, there is the suggestion that "when an actual entity perishes, we cannot say that part of it remains to be carried over into other actual entities, because part of an actual entity, not being an actual entity itself, is nothing at all, since actual entities are the ultimate metaphysical facts" (Das, p. 180). This is fallacious because he overlooks the basic point that while actual entities are the final, real, things in the universe, their components are not, for Whitehead, "noth- ing at all". They are factual components which help to constitute an actual entity. 176 A. I., pp. 250-1. Gentry makes the mistake of assuming that the envisagement of an eternal object and its use in guiding the process of concretion is the only instance of the future entering the present in a determining fashion (p. 201). 177 Whitehead uses the term "atomic" here in the sense of (co-operating) individual-not in the sense of individual with no relations to other individuals. 178 P. R., p. 71. 264</page><page sequence="29">WHITEHEAD S THEORY OF ACTUAL ENTITIES Hooper is obviously mistaken about the meaning of Whitehead's term "super- ject". He assumes, falsely, that Whitehead is referring to the union of a subject and its feelings.'79 As a matter of fact, Whitehead is pointing out that one completed subject provides data available for the use of newly arising actual entities. Whitehead's emphasis on "process" has led some critics to attribute to him a "universal claim for process" (i.e., everything is process).180 Sheldon himself corrects this mistaken contention by pointing out that "objective immortality" involves a denial of the exclusive reign of process.181 Blyth falls into the same error (without later escaping from it). He assumes that for Whitehead "process is the only actuality, actual entities as process can never be in a state of complete determination. They can never achieve a state of determinate 'satisfaction'.-''82 In this Blyth is claiming to show that Whitehead's doctrine of objectification is inconsistent with his supposed complete devotion to process. As a matter of fact, Whitehead stresses endurance as well as process. Not only does he refer to objective immortality, but also to eternal objects and the retention of im- mediacy in God. (See later discussion.) Indeed, in Whitehead's opinion, the process of creative self-development of actual entities depends, (in part) on the achievement of complete satisfaction by other actual entities. Thus Blyth's criticism is based on a serious misunderstanding of Whitehead's actual position. Another apparent paradox is involved in Whitehead's claim that actual entities are both "in time" and "out of time". "Every actual entity is 'in time' so far as its physical pole is concerned, and is 'out of time' so far as its mental pole is concerned."183 In other words he is pointing out that since actual entities have physical prehensions of other actual entities, and these other actual entities are in the past; further, since each actual entity makes a contribution to future actual entities-hence in this sense any actual entity is in time. This seems to be involved in Whitehead's claim that "each temporal succession is temporal because it is incomplete.""'4 Another phase of the meaning of the term time, in Whitehead's usage, is brought out in his discussion of the contention that a past actual entity is not present in all its living intensity in a newly arising actual entity-the past fades. Speaking technically, objectification involves elimina- tion. Thus Whitehead suggests "time is a 'perpetual perishing'.""85 However, since any actual entity has conceptual prehensions it is out of time in the sense that it thereby prehends eternal objects which are timeless data. Although Whitehead claims that an actual entity is in time (in the sense just specified) he contends that the process by which an actual entity builds itself up is not a temporal process. "The actual entity is seen as a process; there is a 179 H (1), p. 291. 180 W. H. Sheldon, America's Progressive Philosophy, p. 147.

This genetic passage... is not in physical time."'18 Physical time involves division, distinction between present, past and future actual entities. On the other hand the self-creative process of any actual entity is so thoroughly unified by its subjective aim that this division cannot be made. However, according to this "epochal" theory of time each "actual entity is the enjoyment of a certain quantum of physical time."'87 Whitehead also states that the actual entity, "in its character of concrete satisfaction, is divisible into prehensions which concern its first temporal half and into prehensions which concern its second temporal half."188 In other words, no temporal distinction may be properly applied to any actual entity if you consider its process of origination. From this point of view it is one indivisible process. This is the so-called genetic approach. However, Whitehead apparently admits that if you consider the completed actual entity you can discern that the process involved phases, one following after the other. By using this analytic or "co-ordinate" method of approach, temporal distinctions may be made with reference to an actual entity. Whitehead contends that "every actual entity in the temporal world is to be credited with a spatial volume for its perspective standpoint."'89 It has been noted that "the actual entity is the enjoyment of a certain quantuum of physical time." It is then suggested that "there is a spatial element in the quantuum as well as a temporal element. Thus the quantuum is an extensive region. This region is the determinate basis which the concrescence presupposes."'90 In other words, Whitehead is pointing out that since an actual entity in its process of concretion takes in data from actual entities at different spatial positions, the region constituted by these contributing actual entities is included in the newly arising actual entity. Hence the spatial aspect. Of general interest is the fact that Whitehead uses the term "feeling" in various senses: (a) positive prehensions of data are called feelings ;19 (b) some of the data experienced are called feelings (eternal objects, of course, are not feelings); for example, patches of color, particular sounds and smells;192 (c) subjective forms are called feelings (for example anger and fear).'93 These various uses of the term feeling can only be distinguished by reference to the context in which they occur. At this point the fallacious nature of several general criticisms of Whitehead's position may be noted. In view of his emphasis on a "psychological" approach to the problem of the nature of reality it is strange to find Bixler stating: "Instead of saying-that we 186 P. R., pp. 433-4. 187 P.

R., p. 35. 266</page><page sequence="31">WHITEHEAD S THEORY OF ACTUAL ENTITIES should look within ourselves to discover what obtains outside, Whitehead urges us to formulate first a theory of the world based on scientific observation and metaphysical reflection."'94 Because of the fact that Whitehead's theory of actual entities is expounded chiefly on the basis of a detailed description of ordinary human experience, the inaccuracy of the following criticism by Hocking is clearly evident. " 'Actual occasion' is not a term of description in the direct sense. It is an hypothesis. It cannot be kept in place by pointing to its presence as a datum: it can only hold its own if it proves to be a valuable conceptual tool."'95 Dewey finds in Whitehead's thought a strong tendency (though, he admits that this is not the only one) to assign "ontological priority to general characters and essences, and subordination to them of the existences actually observed in nature."'96 This criticism is based chiefly on Whitehead's suggestion that he is trying to frame "a coherent, logical, necessary, system of ideas." However, Dewey's interpretation seems to involve the fallacy of neglected aspect. This scheme of concepts is a series of descriptive generalizations of experience. Thus, these generalities do not dictate the form that experience must take. Further, Whitehead's detailed discussion of the status of eternal objects in the universe indicates that they do not have a prior reality in comparison with actual entities. As has been noted: "Actual entities are the final real things of which the universe is made up." Eternal objects are components of actual entities. One of the "standard" criticisms of Whitehead's position is that eternal objects are of no use to Whitehead (or anyone else) since actual entities perform all the functions assigned to eternal objects.'97 Eternal objects are characterized by "identity", "permanence", "universality", "abstractness", "potentiality." So are actual entities. This being so, it is argued that eternal objects are a "fifth wheel" in the Whiteheadian equipage. The fallacy involved in the argument is that the terms under consideration have different meanings when applied to eternal objects than they have when applied to actual entities.- Two examples will suffice to make this point, (i) the "potentiality" characteristic of an eternal object is different from that of an actual entity. Whitehead distinguishes be- tween "pure" ("general") and "real" potentiality.198 As a potentiality an eternal object is an abstract possibility. The potentiality provided by actual entities is concrete content. (ii) To take another example: the "permanence"-the un- changing "identity" of an eternal object is different from the identity and per- manence which characterizes a society of actual entities. The eternal object does not change-that is the meaning of permanence and identity in this instance. 194 J. S. Bixler, Whitehead's Philosophy of Religion, The Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead (P.

JOHNSON The permanence and identity of a society of actual entities is due to the fact that one or more eternal objects are successively manifest in the changing process by which a society of actual entities is constituted. Thus a careful examination of Whitehead's point of view indicates that actual entities and eternal objects do not perform the same function in Whitehead's philosophy. Emmet formulates the objection that "division of an actual entity into its prehensions loses the final causation-the subjective aim-which is making this concrescence of prehensions into a real (concrete) unity."199 This comment, however, is hardly accurate because Whitehead's theory of prehensions stresses the point that these prehensions are guided by the subjective aim of the subject.200 Lintz is inaccurate when in discussing the origin of an actual entity he states: "God is the mental pole of the process, while the datum is the physical pole."201 Whitehead's actual position is that prehensions of eternal objects, which are present in the experience of God, constitute the mental pole. Prehensions of other data provided by ordinary actual entities, and by the consequent nature of the unique actual entity God, constitute the physical pole. This reference to the function of God brings us to a more detailed discussion of this general phase of Whitehead's position. GOD The fact that Whitehead's most comprehensive and systematic discussion of the nature of God is found in a brief section at the end of Process and Reality should not mislead one into thinking that God is relatively unimportant in his cosmological scheme. As a matter of fact, God performs many essential func- tions. According to Whitehead "God is not to be treated as an exception to all metaphysical principles-. He is their chief exemplification."202 Like any other actual entity, God has conceptual and physical poles. These poles are referred to as the primordial and consequent natures of God. "The 'primordial nature' of God is the concrescence of an unity of conceptual feelings, including among their data all eternal objects.-The 'consequent nature' of God is the physical prehension by God of the actualities of the evolving universe."203 God also has a superject nature in that he provides data to be used in the self-creative process of other actual entities. Das levels the serious charge that Whitehead, the philosopher of organic inter- relation, has formulated a system which is inherently dualistic. "Our difficulty throughout has been, firstly, with the inherent dualism at every step ... physical pole and mental pole, primordial nature and consequent nature, are, each pair, no doubt, said to stand for the two aspects of the same thing. But we are not provided with any unifying principle which would clearly show their internal 199 Emmet, p. 97. 200 See P. R., p. 108. 201 Lintz, p. 55. 202 P. R., p. 521. 203 P. R., p. 134. 268</page><page sequence="33">WHITEHEAD S THEORY OF ACTUAL ENTITIES unity."204 This criticism is based on Das' disregard of the fact Whitehead claims to be offering an analytic description of observed fact. He finds two poles in all actual entities (including God). That, in Whitehead's opinion, is the fact of the matter. No "unifying principle" is needed apart from the fact that they are discovered to be two phases of one actual entity. In discussing God Whitehead concentrates first on the primordial nature; he then considers the consequent nature. It is unfortunate that on occasion he carelessly refers to the primordial nature of God as though it were a "complete" actuality. For example, we find him using the phrases; "nontemporal actual- ity"; "conceptual actuality" and even "primordial actual entity".205 It is obvious from his total discussion that these phrases are not to be taken literally. Ely who follows Whitehead's bad example206 and calls the primordial nature of God "an actually existing\being" is aware that really "God is a unity, and neither side of his nature could exist without the other."207 There is a similar confusion in Loomer's discussion of God. He notes that "the distinction within God is one of reason only-there is no metaphysical interval between God's two natures."208 However, having done this, he makes the woefully mistaken claim that the basic concrete actuality is God as consequent.209 THE PRIMORDIAL NATURE OF GOD In their process of self-creation, actual entities require the lure of ideal possi- bilities to stimulate them and at the same time offer a pattern for the guidance of their on-going process of development. It has been previously noted that eternal objects fulfill this function. However, unless eternal objects are organ- ized and interrelated, they will provide little practical guidance. For example, the eternal objects "fire" and "burn" are far more effective in the experience of a subject if they are conceptually prehended as related, than if they are prehended as part of an incoherent conglomeration. In order to account for the experienced patterned relationship of eternal objects, Whitehead claims that it is necessary to refer to an agent which is responsible for the arranging. Thus, he states, "All real togetherness is togetherness in the formal constitution of an actual- ity."210 Not only does God's primordial nature provide for the arrangement of eternal objects, the fact that as arranged they are present in the actual entity God renders them available for use by other actualities. This is God's function as the "principle of concretion."211 This phase of God's activity is one of the 204 Das, p. 189. 205 P. R., pp. 522, 134. 206 S. L.

JOHNSON basic facts of the universe, or as Whitehead calls it "the ultimate irrationality", the fact that must be accepted without demanding "reasons why".212 The objection which is frequently raised with reference to Whitehead's phrase "ultimate irrationality" seems hardly justified. After all, are there not some ultimate facts, which are the starting point in explaining other less ultimate facts? In view of the preceding discussion there seems to be an obvious mistake in Parker's complaint that "eternal objects are universals, believed to have a sort of Platonic existence independent of the stream of experience and ingressing there from above, for reasons which I find it hard to understand."213 Equally mistaken is Shorey's reference to "Professor Whitehead's isolation of eternal objects in the realm of possibility."214 Loomer offers an inadequate statement concerning God's primordial nature. "God as primordial is the order between possibilities; he is the universal structure or pattern that has ingression in every event." Interestingly enough this inac- curate statement is followed, on the next page by a correct one. "Whitehead states that the realm of possibilities is a realm because God envisages or feels these possibilities."215 There is a further point to be noted. God in his primordial nature desires that these eternal objects, as included in his nature, be received as data by other actual entities. Whitehead suggests that there is a "yearning after concrete fact-no particular facts, but after some actuality."216 However, as has been noted, God cannot force the ingression of any eternal object on any actual entity. As Whitehead himself so effectively expresses it: "God's role is not the combat of productive force with productive force, of destructive force with destructive force with destructive force; it lies in the patient operation of the overwhelming rationality of his conceptual harmonization ... he is the poet of the world, with tender patience leading it by his vision of truth, beauty and goodness."217 A careful consideration of this general situation reveals the fact that all con- ceptual prehensions of eternal objects are in reality hybrid-physical prehensions of God. This is evident from the fact that since the eternal objects are present as part of the actual entity God, their prehension is the prehension of (part of) an actual entity. Hence it is physical. But it is a hybrid physical prehension because the data prehended are eternal objects. COMMENTS ON SOME CRITICISMS OF WHITEHEAD'S DISCUSSION OF GOD'S PRIMORDIAL NATURE Whitehead contends that any actual entity "derives from God its basic con- ceptual aim."218 This statement has aroused the criticism that if the constituent 212 S.

R., p. 343. 270</page><page sequence="35">WHITEHEAD'S THEORY OF ACTUAL ENTITIES activities of an actual entity "are merely the outcome of the subjective aim of the subject, which is initially derived from God, it is difficult to see where the original decision (originality and unique autonomy) of the actual entity, as self- creating, lies."219 This criticism overlooks the fact that while God provides a possible pattern (eternal object) which may serve as the subjective aim, each actual entity is entirely responsible for the selection and use of this pattern. In this sense, each actual entity is self-creative.220 "Thus an originality (an actual entity) in the temporal world is conditioned, though not determined, by an initial subjective aim (an eternal object which constitutes a goal) supplied by the ground of all order and of all originality (God)".221 Whitehead expresses this same idea in a slightly different fashion when he states, "He (God) in his primordial nature, is unmoved by love for this particular, or that particular."222 The genuine autonomy of ordinary actual entities is apparently completely disregarded by Ely when he suggests that God as Primordial "decides which patterns of possibility are to be realized by the underlying activity.-He (God) uses (the forms of possibility) and directs them so as to bring forth the order of the concrete reality that we actually find."223 Continued reading of Ely reveals that God is supposed to attribute "a measure of spontaneity and self creation"224 to actual entities. Finally, Ely suggests that in some situations "God proposes, but the event disposes."225 As a matter of fact this is what Whitehead believes happens in all cases. Moreover, the nature of God's proposing is misunderstood by Ely. It is contended that God presents to the "just-born" event the ideal outcome that he (God) desires to be realized.-"If the event rejects the outcome God proposes to it when it first enters upon its process of growth, God must offer it (reluctantly perhaps?) other alternatives."226 As a matter of fact, God offers the eternal objects all at once. Further, contrary to Ely's opinion, White- head does not claim that God offers a definite individualized programme to each specific actual entity. Ely himself quotes Whitehead's statement which makes this point clear. "He (God) in his primordial nature, is unmoved by love for this particular or that particular."227 This non-particularization of God's "love" provides the basis of a reply to Das' objection: "This nature (God's primordial) is supposed to be eternal and unchanging, because it is finally complete. But when the possibilities come to be realized, does it make no difference to the appetition which yearns after their 219 D. C.

H. JOHNSON realization?"228 The point to be made is that if an eternal object is exemplified in one or several actual entities that does not diminish God's yearning because he does not yearn to have an eternal object exemplified in any one particular actual entity. It is apparently an insatiable yearning which is not exhausted by one (or several) satisfaction(s). The account of the function of God's primordial nature, provided by Metz suffers from all the deficiencies of the preceding statements and is mitigated by none of the partial corrections of initial errors which improve Ely's account. Metz states: "He (God) is the creator of all things, the cause why a world exists at all, why it comes from possibility into actuality and why from the unbounded fullness of possibilities of world-becoming, a determinate world has become."229 This discussion will perhaps "clear up" the so-called difficulty raised by Hart- shorne: "Whitehead does say that the eternal objects have indeterminacy as to their mode of ingression, but there is perhaps some obscurity as to what this qualification involves."230 It is interesting to note that the exact opposite of the preceding criticism has also been expressed. Instead of criticising him for assigning to God ultimate responsibility for all creative activity and novelty, Whitehead has been charged with entirely separating God from the creative process. Thus E. W. Hall states "This particular actuality (God) is not only outside the creative process com- prising all other actualities; it is also entirely independent of the latter."231 This statement, purporting to be the obvious interpretation of Whitehead's suggestion that God's primordial nature is not "directly related to the given course of history,"232 is evidently based on a total disregard of the fundamental principles of his system. Hall's contention also involves a profound misunderstanding of the passage which he has quoted. Indeed its real meaning is clearly indicated in the paragraph which follows it. Whitehead points out that "an eternal object is always a potentiality for actual entities; but in itself, as conceptually felt, it is neutral as to the fact of its physical ingression in any particular actual entity of the temporal world."233 Thus God (or his component eternal objects) is not directly (necessarily) related to a specific course of history. To claim that Whitehead regards God as an entity independent of the creative process com- prising all other actual entities is quite inexcusable in view of Whitehead's re- peated, explicit, denials of this interpretation. For example, God is "with all creation."234-"There is no meaning-to 'God' apart from-the 'temporal creatures'."235 228 Das, p. 187 (material in brackets mine). 229 R.

R., p. 344. 272</page><page sequence="37">WHITEHEAD S THEORY OF ACTUAL ENTITIES Whitehead's statement that "every eternal object has entered into the con- ceptual feelings of God,"236 indicates according to Hall that eternal objects "are simply aspects of-actual entities".237 The erroneous nature of this interpreta- tion should be evident from a careful examination of Whitehead's theory of eternal objects. It is true that eternal objects do not exist apart, in absolute abstraction, from actual entities. As potentialities they are related to all actual entities, that is to say they are envisaged by God and hence made available for the use of all other actual entities. But, they are not merely aspects (adjectival qualities) of actual entities. Eternal objects are distinct components of actual entities. Any actual entity is a creative grouping of these components (and others). In any case Whitehead indicates very clearly his answer to the specific problem: What is the relative status of eternal objects and God? He states: "He (God) does not create eternal objects; for his nature requires them in the same degree that they require him."238 In justice to Hall it should be noted that he admits that Whitehead offers a negative answer to the question: "Are not eternal objects simply aspects of actual entities, with no status of their own?" However, Hall misunderstands the quotation which he uses in making this point. He refers to "the many, which are the universe disjunctively, (which) become the one actual occasion."239 He thinks that the phrase "disjunctive multiplicity" refers to subsisting eternal ob- jects. As a matter of fact, "disjunctive multiplicity, in this case, is a character- istic of actual entities as a careful reading of the passage will indicate. Other phases of his discussion at this point are sound, e.g., a reference to Whitehead's doctrine of ingression. Lintz offers an interesting criticism of Whitehead's discussion of the status of eternal objects in the universe and their relation to God. He suggests that "the fact that they are called eternal objects does not prevent one from demand- ing the cause of them. . . . the being or becoming of the eternal objects is not satisfactorily explained. Their origin violates the ontological principle. They float in from nowhere, and are merely ordered in God's Conceptual Valuation."240 In reply to this sort of criticism it can only be pointed out that Whitehead claims to be describing components of the universe. Among these components are eternal objects. In his opinion Lintz's question about their origin is irrelevant. There was no first day of creation for eternal objects. In any case, Lintz seems definitely wrong when he claims that Whitehead disregards his ontological principle. As a matter of fact, Whitehead contends that eternal objects are part of the actual entity, God.241 Lintz raises another critical point. It involves Whitehead's statement: "God differs from the other actual entities in the fact that Hume's principle of the derivative character of conceptual feelings does not hold for Him." Lintz pro- 236 P. R., p. 382. 237 Hall, p. 37. See also G. Vlastos, Organic Categories in Whitehead, The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. XXXIV (1937), p. 259. 238 P.

JOHNSON ceeds to comment. "It is contradictory to hold that the principle of the deriva- tive does not hold for God, and yet that His nature is a concrescence of con- ceptual feelings."242 Whitehead's actual position, one that does not involve him in contradiction, is this. Other actual entities derive the data of their conceptual prehensions from God, but God does not derive the data of his conceptual feelings from any other actual entities. The eternal objects are eternally present as part of his make-up. Stebbings in her review of Process and Reality in Mind243 indicates either a misunderstanding of Whitehead's opinion of the relation between eternal objects and God, or is guilty of inadequate exposition. She suggests that Whitehead makes the multiplicity of potentials actual by placing it in a non-temporal actu- ality. In offering this comment she is apparently overlooking or disregarding Whitehead's point that an actual entity (in this case God) can conceptually pre- hend a potentiality (eternal object) without thereby making it an actuality. For example, a person may think of wisdom without thereby becoming wise! Two closely related criticisms of Whitehead's theory of God have frequently been expressed. They are: (a) Why apply the term God to the type of actual entity so designated by Whitehead; (b) How do you know that an actual entity, possessing this sort of conceptual pole, exists? In dealing with question "b" Whitehead reminds his critics that he is attempting (i) to describe entities which are experienced, and (ii) to develop categories which may be used to describe all actual entities. One of Whitehead's most important descriptive generaliza- tions is the so-called "ontological principle". This involves the claim that every element in the universe must be somewhere, i.e., present in some actual entity. As has been previously noted, God, in his primordial nature, provides the "some- where" for the multiplicity of eternal objects. Whitehead contends that the fact that we find eternal objects available and organized for the use of all ordinary actual entities indicates that God does exist as an organizer and as a co-operating member of the active environment of actual entities from which a newly arising actual entity selects its content and principles of arrangement. In short, as Whitehead himself expresses the matter, the general character of things requires that there be such an entity.244 As Emmet points out, this is a version of the traditional cosmological argument.245 As a further proof of the existence of God and justification for his use of the term God, Whitehead claims to have a direct prehension of this timeless source of all order and that this feeling "acquires that 'subjective form' of refreshment and companionship at which religions aim."246 Hartshorne seems to underestimate Whitehead's contention that he is offering a description of observed facts in his discussion of God. As one argument for the existence of God Hartshorne suggests that "his (Whitehead's) categories-require God as their 'chief' and indispensable exemplification."247 It should be obvious 242 Lintz, p. 39. 243 Mind, Vol. XXXIX (1930). 244 See S. M. W., p. 256. 245 See Emmet, p. 250. 246 P.

Categories are simply descriptive generalizations based on facts. One of the facts is God. This, and subsequent discussion tends to refute Ely's claim that "When White- head is speaking as a philosopher he has no right to the term God."248 THE CONSEQUENT NATURE OF GOD Whitehead's discussion of the consequent nature of God is woefully condensed, being confined, almost exclusively, to the last ten pages of Process and Reality. The task of interpretation is not rendered any easier by the snatches of glorious literature which are packed into this short space. The somewhat detailed usage of conventional religious terms is not an unmixed blessing. Yet through it all there shines a basic insight which perhaps could not have been expressed more adequately. Whitehead's consideration of the consequent nature of God is a manifestation of his attempt to show that God is like any other actual entity, having not only conceptual prehensions (primordial nature) but also physical prehensions of other actual entities. God's consequent nature "is the physical prehension by God of the actualities of the evolving universe."249 In view of the general tenor of Whitehead's discussion it is strange to find a considerable number of misunderstandings concerning the consequent nature of God. For example, Emmet seems to consider the consequent nature of God to be merely the progressive realization of the realm of possibilities (eternal objects) in the temporal world.-"The incoming of the order of eternal objects which constitutes the Primordial Nature of God into the temporal course of events is called the Consequent Nature of God."250 In justice to Emmet, it should be noted that she also (correctly) refers to the consequent nature of God as being the physical pole of an actual entity and not merely the ingression of eternal objects into the temporal world.251 God's consequent nature is not complete. As the term implies it "is conse- quent upon the creative advance of the world."252 Yet, in one sense, the conse- quent nature of God does manifest the characteristic of completeness. The meaning of this apparently contradictory contention must be carefully examined. In an ordinary actual entity the past is not present in full immediacy. "The process of time veils the past below distinctive feeling.-The past is present under an abstraction." This is due to the fact that ordinary actual entities rise and pass away, droplets of experience, creatures of short duration. They create themselves and then pass on, leaving dead fragments as data for the possible use of newly arising actual entities. In this sense the temporal process is a "perpetual perishing".253 In striking contrast to the "short and simple annals", the brief and transitory existence of ordinary actual entities is the experience of 248 Ely, p. 56. 249 P. R., p. 134. 260 Emmet, p. 259. 261 Emmet, pp. 263; 270. See also Lintz, p. 36. 262 P. R., p. 524. '23 p. R., p. 517. 275</page><page sequence="40">A. H. JOHNSON the uniquely different so-called actual entity, God.254 Whitehead contends that God's consequent nature is characterized by "everlastingness". He means that God is an entity which does not perish. His content never becomes available for other actual entities as the result of a process by which God passes out of existence. The contents of his nature are not lost by being objectified in some other actuality at the demise of God. God grows by taking in new content but the content already present is retained in all its vividness. In this fashion White- head attempts to offer support for the insight of religion that some things must not be allowed to perish in the ongoing process of life. Thus it may be said, concentrating on his consequent nature, that God is temporal in the sense that change and development occur within his being; but God is non-temporal in the sense that he never perishes. Further, God is non-temporal in the sense that his primordial nature, the envisagement of eternal objects, does not involve change.255 Thus, Lintz is not entirely correct when he states: "God, even in his consequent nature, is non-temporal."256 Considerable discussion has arisen concerning Whitehead's consideration of the process whereby data from other actual entities are absorbed into the conse- quent nature of God. Hall contends that "all occasions are conserved (in God) -in their very immediacy of occurrence."257 Hartshorne is a persistent advocate of this same interpretation.258 However, there seem to be adequate grounds for disagreement with their interpretation of Whitehead's position. In the first place, it must be remembered that objectification inescapably in- volves some loss of content. Further, objectification cannot occur without the literal demise of the actual entity which obtains objective immortality in another. In other words, the state of objective immortality is fundamentally different from the process of self creation during which the actual entity is alive and enjoys its own content. As a matter of fact, Whitehead specifically states: "Each novel actuality in the temporal world contributes such elements as it can to a realiza- tion in God".259 It is true that Whitehead says: "God exercises a tender care260 254 Whitehead's contention that God is like other actual entities is open to serious ques- tion as will be shown later in this article. 255 See P. R., p. 73. 256 Lintz, p. 33. See also Ely's excellent discussion of this point, p. 33, footnote 25, and Hartshorne p. 541, Hooper (1) p. 286. 257 Hall, p. 40 (material in brackets mine). 258 Hartshorne, pp. 519; 529. Strangely enough Hartshorne offers an interpretation of how the past may be in the present which seems to contradict his claim that "God fully possesses or prehends" every past occasion in its entirety. Hartshorne states: "But per- haps it will be thought a paradox that the past should, in present experience, be still immediately given. I have elsewhere on several occasions explained this to mean that the past involves universals of which the latter events are instances" (Hartshorne, p. 543). See also Das 166-7 and Wahl, p. 133. 259 P. R., p. 134 (emphasis mine). 260 This and a preceding reference to "God's tender care" reminds one of Whitehead's contention that the terms of religious devotion can be legitimately applied to his meta- physical God. Further illustrations of this point are noted in subsequent sections of this article. 276</page><page sequence="41">WHITEHEAD 'S THEORY OF ACTUAL ENTITIES that nothing be lost", but he adds a limiting clause-"that can be saved".261 The implication is clear in both quotations-everything in ordinary actual entities is not used by God, or saved. Other statements support this interpretation. For example: "Each actuality in the temporal world has its reception into God's nature. The corresponding element in God's nature is not temporal actuality, _.262 In this general connection it is important to note that when Whitehead claims that God's consequent nature has "the property of combining creative advance with the retention of mutual immediacy"263 he is not referring to the preservation of the inner life of ordinary actual entities, in God; rather he is discussing the preservation of God's inner "life". Also, when Whitehead, dis- cussing the experiences of God, refers to "the phase of perfected actuality, in which the many are one everlastingly, without the qualification of any loss either of individual identity or of completeness of unity"264 he is apparently not sug- gesting that actual entities are preserved completely with undiminished reality in God. Rather he seems to be saying that the elements contributed by actual entities at their demise retain their identity, these accepted elements are not drastically changed by God. This point is given specific illustration in White- head's contention that evil and good are taken into the experience of God as such. "All the 'opposites' (e.g., good and evil)-are incorrigibly there."265 When Hartshorne contends that God's relation to the world is such that "all of it is his body"266 he is mistaken. God does not include all the content of available actual entities. Further, many actual entities, those in the process of self-creation, while they are in the world, they are, as such, not yet at the "data producing" stage. These points must also be made with reference to Lintz's contention that Whitehead's philosophy is "at least latently pantheistic,-God is the actual world as prehended by Him,-. In that way, God and the world are physically one. In that sense, therefore, the philosophy of organism may be called pantheistic."267 Lintz finds further fault with Whitehead's theory that all actual entities are prehended in God's consequent nature, on the grounds that (i) "the unity at- tained is really an accident, due rather to chance than to design." (ii) White- head's claim that all actual entities are physically prehended by God blots out the distinction between the material and the spiritual. In this connection he charges Whitehead with denying the existence of both matter and spirit.268 The erroneous nature of these charges should be obvious. The first-that the unity 261 P. R., p. 525.

JOHNSON achieved by God's prehension of other actual entities is the result of accident disregards Whitehead's theory that it is guided by God's subjective aim and involves the co-operation of other actual entities in making data available. Thus, contrary to Lintz's claim, there seems to be "sufficient reason" for the process. Further, it is strange to find Lintz offering this objection in view of his previous claim that "The ultimate end of all entities is 'satisfaction' in the consequent nature of God."269 With reference to the second objection: If the word "physi- cal" prehension is objectionable to Lintz he should realize (he seems to on oc- casion, e.g., p. 61) that the phrase is used in a technical sense. As a matter of fact, although Whitehead claims that matter and spirit are both discussable in terms of actual entities, he does not blot out the distinction. The "material" characteristics of entities or groups of entities are chiefly the result of physical prehension. The so-called "spiritual" activities are chiefly found in the realm of conceptual prehension.270 Further, physical prehension is not the only linkage between ordinary actual entities and God. There are also hybrid physical pre- hensions. This activity involves communication on the level of eternal objects rather than the transfer of concrete content. Loomer's discussion of the relation between God and other actual entities em- bodies the claim that Whitehead has two divergent points of view. Concen- trating on the problem as to whether or not values are retained in God without loss, Loomer contends 'that there are passages supporting both "loss" and "no- loss". The fact that Whitehead supports the former of these two points of view has already been indicated in this article. In any case, Loomer is incorrect when he states that "objective immortality" means "that thepast-remains what it was-unchangeably so."271 Further, he mistakenly seems to identify "creativity" and "all of the past".272 It would appear that Whitehead is guilty of unpardonable verbal juggling when he contends that "the consequent nature of God-is just as much a multi- plicity as it is a unity."273 However, this statement is not as contradictory as it seems at first glance. In the last sections of Process and Reality Whitehead is considering the "final opposites", among which are "God" and the "World". Whitehead points out that these opposed elements stand in mutual requirement. The universe, upon analysis, reveals these two factors, both essential elements in the creative process, both making a contribution to the being of the other. The essential element in God's nature is the permanent unity of vision (the conceptual prehension of eternal objects), seeking physical multiplicity (interaction with concrete actual entities via physical prehension). The essential element in the World (of actual entities) is the volatile multiplicity of finite actual entities seeking a prefected unity. God's consequent nature is the prehension of the many other 269 Lintz, p. 16. 270 See A. H. Johnson, The Psychology of A. N.

R., p. 531. 278</page><page sequence="43">WHITEHEAD'S THEORY OF ACTUAL ENTITIES actual entities. In this sense God is many. However, it must not be forgotten that this multiplicity is absorbed in a certain fashion, (as has been previously noted) into God's unity. Hartshorne seems to "nod" when dealing with God's consequent nature. He refers to "the endless series of consequent natures of God."274 A careful examina- tion of Whitehead's metaphysics indicates that Whitehead actually regards the consequent nature of God as one ongoing phase of the experience of an actual entity. It is the continuing prehension by God of other actual entities. If God were a "society", (see later discussion of this concept) each member of which exemplified the distinctively divine primordial nature and then passed on pro- viding data for another similar actual entity, this whole series being called God -one of the most essential characteristics of God would be lost, the retention of "immediacy." If God were a society there would be an inescapable loss of divine content since the linkage between members of a society is the process of objectifi- cation and this involves elimination. It should be noted that in his discussion of the consequent nature of God Whitehead occasionally slips into remarks which do not accurately convey his meaning (as expressed more carefully elsewhere). For example, when he states that God as consequent is "fully actual" he really means that the actual entity God, having a physical pole (consequent nature) as well as a mental pole (pri- mordial nature) therefore is fully actually. This same general criticism also applies to the suggestion that the "consequent nature of God is conscious".275 As a matter of fact it is Whitehead's considered opinion that God is conscious because he has both mental and physical poles and hence is able to apprehend facts and confront them with alternatives. (This is what Whitehead means by consciousness.) In short, the mere fact that God possesses a physical pole does not, therefore, guarantee that he is conscious. deBurgh raises the question as to whether the appearance of consciousness in God depends on the rise of consciousness in other actual entities and then their inclusion, as conscious, in God.276 The answer seems to be in the negative. God in his consequent nature depends on other actual entities for data, but conscious- ness arises in God, as in any actual entity, because of a certain type of contrast in his experience, the contrast of fact with theory.277 On the basis of a careful examination of relevant material one can find little justification for Stebbing's righteous indignation expressed in these umbrage freighted words: "Professor Whitehead's indefensible use of language becomes nothing short of scandalous when he speaks of 'God'. He says that 'God' is a term used for 'creativity', 'Aristotelian matter' and 'modern neutral stuff'."278 Actually Whitehead says no such thing. Apparently Stebbing has been misled 274 Charles Hartshorne, On Some Criticisms of Whitehead's Philosophy, The Philosophi- cal Review, Vol. XLIV (1935), p. 343 (emphasis mine).

Here it is stated that "creativity" is another rendering of Aristotelian matter and of modern neutral stuff. The use of the phrase "another rendering" fol- lowing a paragraph in which the consequent nature of God was being discussed might have led Stebbing to think that God was still being discussed-in terms of "creativity". CREATIVITY The preceding reference to creativity brings into the focus of attention a White- headian concept which has suffered from extreme misunderstanding. It has been suggested by many critics that Whitehead regards creativity (process) as the ultimate reality, more ultimate in some sense that actual entities.279 A passage in Science and the Modern World seems to support this interpretation. "In the analogy with Spinoza, his one substance is for me the one underlying activity of realisation individualizing itself in an interlocked plurality of modes. Thus, concrete fact is process. Its primary analysis is into underlying activity of pre- hension, and into prehensive events."280 However, a careful examination of all phases of Whitehead's discussion of this concept indicates unmistakably that he does not regard creativity as more ultimate than actual entities. (The pre- ceding quotation is a further sample of Whitehead's occasional carelessness in exposition.) They retain their status as the final real things of which the uni- verse is made. In the early pages of Process and Reality, where Whitehead attempts to indicate the meaning of his categories, he states that "creativity" is a universal characterizing ultimate matter of fact.281 Thus, in Whitehead's broadly Platonic language, creativity is an "Idea" (eternal object) which is exemplified in particular actual entities. Conversely, the creative process whereby one actual entity appropriates data provided by other actual entities, and so constitutes itself, is an exemplification of the eternal object "creativity". "Creativity is not an external agency with its own ulterior purposes. All actual entities share with God this characteristic of self-causation."282 Hooper vascillates between the correct and an incorrect statement of White- head's position. He is correct when he states: "It must not be supposed, how- ever, that there are two entities, creativity and the creature (product of crea- tivity). There is only-(the) self-creating actual entity which can be regarded 279 For example: "In esthetic creativity, which is for Whitehead the substantial stuff of things, eternal objects are united and particular things, creatures, emerge." (N. P. Stallknecht, Studies In The Philosophy of Creation, p. 130)-"The primal creative cause through which all coming-to-be springs and which impels everything which has become real to ever new forms and events is called by Whitehead creativity."

R., p. 339. 280</page><page sequence="45">WHITEHEAD S THEORY OF ACTUAL ENTITIES from two points of view."283 However, on several occasions he wanders from the straight and narrow path of accuracy and remarks: "The concept (creativity) stands for the ultimate activity which expresses or pluralizes itself into an inter- locked system of modes."-Novel actual entities-are merely " 'begotten' by the general creativity."284 Lintz manifests a similar vascilation,285 as does Ely (who uses the term "underlying activity" in place of "creativity").286 Emmet also falls into error in discussing creativity. She contends that "Creativity,-produces as a primordial fact an ordering of possibilities."287-It is the urge toward the individuation of itself into many actualities. In justice to Emmet it must be noted that she is not entirely satisfied with this. She wonders whether the distinction which she has made between creativity and creatures (actual entities) may not be merely a logical one. She considers the possibility that creativity and the primordial nature of God are complementary sides of the same entity. However, in any case Emmet apparently misses the point that creativity as such is not a distinct, concrete, existent, entity-an underlying process or "ground"-but rather is an eternal object exemplified in all actual entities. Apart from actual entities there is no "actual" creativity. There seems to be no justification, anywhere in Whitehead's discussion for Das' contention that "If creativity were an eternal object, it would be realized, along with other eternal objects only in the conceptual feeling of God."288 The preceding discussion should serve as the basis for answers to several critical questions raised by Moxley.289 He asks: How can Whitehead con- sistently claim: (a) "creativity" is a universal (eternal object); (b) apart from God any eternal object is "indistinguishable from non-entity"; yet (c) God is a creature of creativity? This apparent contradiction is overcome when it is noted that the term creativity is applied to an eternal object and also to the exemplifi- cation of that eternal object. The phrase which refers to God as a Creature of creativity uses the term creativity in the second sense. That is to say, God is the "creature" or outcome of his own self-directed process of self-creation. God's primordial nature is an envisagement of the eternal object "creativity" which is exemplified in the process by which he builds up his consequent nature by pre- hensions of other actual entities. Moxley also claims that Whitehead involves himself in difficulty when he sug- gests that "creativity is another rendering of the Aristotelian matter."290 Aristotelian "matter" is a passive receptive substratum.

JOHNSON are not assigned to creativity. How then can creativity be another rendering of Aristotelian matter? The answer to this question seems to be that the only point they have in common, though this is an essential one in Whitehead's opinion, is the feature that each is without any specific concrete character. Is it not true that an eternal object is abstract, awaiting exemplification in some particular, specific, actual entity? It is at least possible that Loomer is involving himself in misunderstanding when he quotes Whitehead's statement that God is the primordial non-temporal accident of creativity and suggests that this is a reference to God's consequent nature.29 The use of the terms "primordial" and "non-temporal" suggest that Whitehead is referring to God's primordial nature. In addition to the preceding technical details of Whitehead's position concerning God several other, more general, points should be noted. Questions relating to the temporal origin of the universe and the relative im- portance of its various components have involved much learned discussion. White- head's contribution is worthy of note. He contends that there was no "first day" of creation. The self-creative process of actual entities is occurring now. It did in the past, and it is likely to continue in the future. Whitehead seems to suggest that, as far as we can tell, the metaphysical situation has always been as it is now:-actual entities, both ordinary ones and God (with both primordial and consequent natures) interacting creatively. The fact that God's consequent nature is mentioned last in Process and Reality does not mean that for a long time God's primordial nature was deprived of his consequent nature and that it only arose after some ordinary actual entities had created themselves. The distinctive features of the universe are, in Whitehead's opinion, ever present. God "is not before all creation, but with all creation."292 It is obvious from the preceding discussion that Ely is incorrect in his con- tention that the possible (God's primordial nature) is prior to the actual (God's entire experience and other actual entities).293 Equally erroneous is the state- ment by Das-"But ultimately we must come to an actual entity, at the begin- ning of them all, which is not determined by anything else, because there is nothing before it."294 295 In view of Whitehead's continued stress on the self-creativity of successive actual entities, it seems difficult to take seriously Gentry's comment that White- head's thinking "has gone the way of a static absolutism".296 It is true that Whitehead denies physical time to actual entities, and talks of eternal objects in God's primordial nature. However, he does not deny the reality of "process" 291 Loomer, p. 165. 292 P. R., p. 521. 293 Ely, p. 14. For a more detailed discussion of this point see: A. H. Johnson, A Criti- cism of D. Bidney's "Spinoza and Whitehead", The Philosophical Review, Vol. XLVII (1938), pp. 410-14. 294 Das, p. 161. 295 The preceding discussion provides at least a partial answer to some of the critical considerations raised by W. G. deBurgh: Discussion: Professor Whitehead's "Modes of Thought", Philosophy, Vol. XIV (1939), pp. 210-11. 296 Gentry, p. 198. 282</page><page sequence="47">WHITEHEAD'S THEORY OF ACTUAL ENTITIES The ultimately real entities are "creatures of creativity"-i.e., manifest process. Eternal objects are simply instruments used in the process. God's primordial nature is only one phase of God. Other phases of God involve change. Whitehead handles the problem of priority of status, in the universe, in an interesting fashion. He does not regard God as preiminently real and assign dependent reality or non-reality to other entities. Rather Whitehead frequently stresses the notion that God and other actual entities are complementary.297 Without each other they are not themselves. As has been noted, God cannot bestow reality on any actual entity. Each actual entity is its own self-creative agent.298 God provides data for any actual entity (newly arising) and any actual entity (as it perishes) provides data for God. This phase of Whitehead's position is apparently overlooked by Lintz when he states: "His (Whitehead's) creating God is the unconditioned actuality of conceptual feelings at the base of things."299 Having said this, Lintz involves himself in a contradiction by denouncing Whitehead for formulating "a purely anthropomorphic idea of God. He calls Him God, and then permits Him to have a nature just like that of any other man."300 Lintz's point is this: If God is derived (his consequent nature) from external sources, he is on the same level of reality as man and, therefore, cannot be a true creator. Lintz' contention that "the ultimate end of all entities is 'satisfaction' in the consequent nature of God,"301 does not find very obvious support in Whitehead's discussion of actual entities. Whitehead's real position seems to be that different actual entities have different subjective aims. It is true that all actual entities provide data for the use of God, but data are also provided for, and used by, ordinary actual entities. The "satisfaction" which is achieved by any actual entity comes at the end of its own self-creative experience. When an actual entity makes a contribution to God its own satisfaction has already been reached. What is transferred (as has been noted) is not the actual entity as such but only some fragment of the experience of an entity now deceased. THE SUPERJECT NATURE OF GOD Whitehead refers only very briefly to the superject nature of God-the fact that God's experience is made available to newly arising ordinary actual entities. He states: "the principle of universal relativity is not to be stopped at the con- sequent nature of God. This nature itself passes into the temporal world ac- cording to its gradation of relevance to the various concrescent occasions."302 297 P. R., pp. 521; 523; 528. 298 This serves to refute Ratner's contention that Whitehead "proceeds by making dis- tinctions, and then internally involving them in each other so that at the end he has every- thing in everything else-which consequence also obliterates distinctions." J. Ratner, Introduction to John Dewey's Philosophy, John Dewey's Philosophy (Modern Library Giant), p. 218. 299 Lintz, p. 31 (emphasis and material in brackets mine). 300 Lintz, p. 44. 301 Lintz, p. 16. 302 P. R., p. 532. To this phase of God's activity Whitehead applies the phrase, "The love of God". He also suggests that "the kingdom of heaven is with us today." God also is called the "fellow-sufferer who understands" (P. R., p. 532). 283</page><page sequence="48">A. H. JOHNSON Fries comments very aptly that "God is the one actual entity which has a superject nature and objective immortality without ceasing to be an immediate, creative actuality."303 This is one of the bases of the distinction which must be drawn between God and ordinary actual entities. Loomer is probably wrong when he states that "God appears to be perceived by means of 'hybrid physical feelings' never by 'pure physical feelings'."304 In making this claim he overlooks the contribution made by God's superject nature. Presumably this involves a transfer of concrete content, physical feeling, not just a grasp of the eternal objects present in God's primordial nature (i.e., hybrid physical feeling). It is true that Whitehead specifically states: "The objectifi- cation of God in a temporal subject is effected by hybrid feelings with God's conceptual feelings as data."305 However, this does not seem to be a complete statement of God's contribution to a temporal subject. Whitehead's doctrine of objectification and his discussion of God's superject nature seems to support this criticism of Loomer. However, it must be admitted that Whitehead is not excessively clear on this point. Fries makes the strange claim that, according to Whitehead, God's superject nature is conscious and exercises a tender care that nothing be lost.306 This contention is seen to be sadly mistaken in view of Whitehead's point that the superject aspect of an actual entity is that phase of its content which is made available for the use of other actual entities. It is to be noted that one phase of an actual entity is not conscious. The entire actual entity must be functioning in a specific fashion before consciousness is present. Further, it is the consequent nature which functions so as to preserve the data provided by other actual entities. The superject nature does not involve a preserving function. It is a "giving to another" activity. WHITEHEAD AND BRADLEY At this point it is well to note the drastic differentiations which distinguish Whitehead's position from that of Bradley. This is particularly important in view of Whitehead's statement; "though throughout the main body of the work I am in sharp disagreement with Bradley, the final outcome is after all not so greatly different".307 As a matter of fact, these differentiations are so funda- mental that the aptness of the last phrase of the quotation is open to serious question. Bradley bases his philosophy on the "rational" principle that the "real" must be self consistent and all inclusive. If there were a plurality of reals (so-called) the mere fact of plurality would invalidate the claim that any one (or all) of these particulars is real. This follows from the principle that a part, since it is not the whole (all inclusive) cannot be real. In any case, it is Bradley's opinion 303 S. H. Fries, The functions of Whitehead's God, The Monist, Vol. XLVI (1936), pp. 35-6. Hereafter this article will be referred to as "Fries". 304 Loomer, p. 166. See also Fries, p. 51. 305 P. R., p. 377. 306 Fries, p. 28. 307 P. I., p. vii. 284</page><page sequence="49">WHITEHEAD S THEORY OF ACTUAL ENTITIES that reality must be one since "plurality, taken as real contradicts itself. Plural- ity implies relations, it unwillingly asserts always a superior unity."308 Bradley argues further in support of his general point of view: "If, seeking for reality, we go to experience, what we certainly do not find a subject or an object, or indeed any other thing whatever, standing separate and on its own bottom. What we discover rather is a whole in which distinctions can be made, but in which di- visions do not exist."309 On the basis of arguments such as these, the common-sense world of relatively autonomous, separate and distinct persons and things, which we find about us, is distilled by the subtile alchemy of Bradley's thought into a timeless unity of feeling. Our common sense world is branded as mere "appearance" and baptized with the corrosive waters of "disappearance." According to Bradley, time and change are illusions. They imply incompleteness. Reality is complete. "We can hardly say that the Absolute consists of finite things, when the things, as such, are there transmuted and have lost their individual natures."310 It is true, as has been noted, that Whitehead derives from Bradley a hint as to how the internal unity of an actual entity may be explained-i.e., as an inclu- sive whole of feeling. Here, however, all essential similarity stops. Bradley has only one whole of experience, timelessly dissolving all apparent particulars into its "real" unity. Whitehead, on the other hand, claims that there is an infinite multiplicity of actual entities, each autonomous and genuinely distinct. Boodin seems to be the victim of a gross misunderstanding when he remarks: "The only way to transcend thinking is mysticism, into which F. H. Bradley finally found an escape; and, as I understand Whitehead, he agrees with Bradley's final solution."311 Thus, also, Wahl is incorrect in claiming: "Dieu les transforme (les 6v6nements du monde); car il les rev8t de sa forme, de m6me que dans l'absolu de Bradley tous les faits sont transmues." However, in a following paragraph this mistaken notion is corrected. It is noted that "Dieu passe sur le monde un jugment par lequel le faisant entrer dans sa propre vie, il le sauve comme le grand musicien integre A sa symphonie triomphante les douleurs des dissonances."312 It has been pointed out that there is a place for "timeless unity" in White- head's cosmology. God's consequent nature, though it grows by taking in new content, is timeless in the sense that none of its component contends fade. It differs from Bradley's Absolute in that it (God's consequent nature) holds within its life phases of other actual entities only after these actual entities have, as such, passed out of existence.313 Thus, God's consequent nature does not deny the 308 F. H. Bradley, Appearance and Reality, p. 460, Oxford University Press, 1930. Here- after this book will be referred to as "Bradley". 309 Bradley, p. 128. See also p. 403.

R., p. 525). 285</page><page sequence="50">A. H. JOHNSON reality of evolving actual entities. Indeed God's consequent nature could not exist without the data provided by other actual entities. Bradley's trust in a purely "logical" criterion of reality, on the basis of which he denies the possibility of a plurality of reals, leaves him open to Whitehead's penetrating comment: "The only logical conclusion to be drawn, when a contra- diction issues from a train of reasoning, is that at least one of the premises in the inference is false."314 In other words, Whitehead contends that if facts in im- mediate experience involve contradiction (in the opinion of a rationalist), that does not justify their reduction to non-entity. RELATIONS A brief reference to Whitehead's position concerning the problem of "relations" is relevant here. In the history of philosophy, there has been discussion of the relative merits of theories stressing "internal" or "external" relations. White- head refuses to place himself in either camp. For example, he states: "It is evident that if the solidarity of the physical] world is to be relevant to the descrip- tion of its individual actualities, it can only be by reason of the fundamental internality of the relationships in question. On the other hand, if the individual discreteness of the actualities is to have its weight, there must be an aspect in these relationships from which they can be conceived as external, that is, as bonds between divided things."315 This emphasis on both internal and external relations is embodied in Whitehead's general discussion of the nature of actual entities. All actual entities have internal relations with all available actual entities in the sense that a genuine transfer of constitutive content occurs. How- ever, as has been reiterated, any actual entity is not entirely determined in its essential selfhood by the data provided by these "internal" relationships. The factor of self-determination which characterizes each actual entity and the con- temporary freedom of contemporary actual entities (see preceding discussion) indicates the fact that relations are in this sense "external". As long as the category of "substance" was taken seriously the problem of the relationship of a plurality of reals was a serious problem. Whitehead's denial of substance and his substitution of the theory of actual entities makes possible this distinctive solution to the problem. THE WORLD OF THE NON-PHILOSOPHER The preceding discussion has apparently little relevance to ordinary physical objects of everyday experience. Also certain phases of ordinary mental experi- ence seem to be disregarded. Specifically, in view of the contention that actual entities incessantly rise and pass away (with the exception of God) how can Whitehead do justice to the "evident" permanence of observed physical objects and the apparent continuity of personality. Whitehead's theory of "society" bears on this problem. 314 p. R., p. 12. 315 P. R., pp. 470-1 (emphasis mine). 286</page><page sequence="51">WHITEHEAD'S THEORY OF ACTUAL ENTITIES Societies arise because of the fundamental characteristic of all actual entities, their mutual immanence by means of the process of prehension. When the actual entities in any group are interrelated in this most general sense, these actual entities constitute a "nexus".31 A "society" arises as the result of a more specific, intimate sort of relationship characterized by "social order". This situation is described thus: " 'A nexus enjoys 'social order' when (i) there is a common element of form illustrated in the definiteness of each of its included actual entities, and (ii) this common element of form arises in each member of the nexus by reason of the conditions imposed upon it by its prehensions of some other members of the nexus, and (iii) these prehensions impose that condition of reproduction by reason of their inclusion of positive feelings involving that com- mon form. Such a nexus is called a 'society', and the common form is the 'defining characteristic' of the society.' "317 On the basis of Whitehead's general position, it is obvious that a society must involve "antecedents and subsequents"318 or, in other words, temporal contiguity. A contemporary group of actual entities could not form a complete society since as such they could have no direct interrelations. However, there is an indirect type of relationship enjoyed by contemporary occasions.319 This is due to the fact that the pasts of the contemporary actual contemporary entities in question have something in common. Hence, each inherits from its past similar elements. In this sense "the interrelations of the present are derived from a reference to the past."320 The quality of "endurance" in the universe is accounted for by reference to the function of societies. An actual entity arises and then perishes; temporal or linear succession of actual entities, in a sense, "carries on": (a) the same defining characteristic continues to be exemplified; (b) there is mutual immanence (objectification) of the successive occasions. Such a temporal and continuous succession of entities is called a "personal society".321 A man, defined as an enduring percipient, is an example of a personal society. It is, of course, evident that there are other types of social organization manifest in the more complex interrelations of actual entities. A complex society analysable into various series or strands of personal societies is called a corpuscular society.322 For example, an animal body is not a society of the simple personal sort-one linear sequence of entities. It is composed of a many entities, co-ordinated in a very complex fashion. At any moment an animal body is composed of a vast group of con- temporary entities each a member of a different personal society or general nexus. The tenuous nature of this linkage between contemporaries has been previously noted. "Most of the animals, including all the vertebrates, seem to have their social 316 A. I., pp. 258-9. 17 A.

JOHNSON system dominated by a subordinate society which is 'personal'.-But the lower forms of animal life, and all vegetation, seem to lack the dominance of any in- cluded personal society. A tree is a democracy."323 The nature of the "domi- nance" exercised by the personal society is worthy of note. The personal society (or more accurately, the component actual entities) cannot force any line of activity on the complex society in which it finds itself. It can only provide data and trust that these data will be taken into the being of the other component actual entities of the complex society.324 Whitehead's general point of view is the basis of some interesting comments concerning the nature of human personality and in particular the venerable body-mind problem. In Whitehead's opinion, the "ego", is not an enduring static entity. It is a series of actual entities.325 This "final percipient route of occasions is perhaps some thread of happenings wandering in 'empty' space amid the intersticies of the brain.-By reason of the body, with its miracle or order, the treasures of the past environment are poured into the living occasion.-In its turn, this culmination of bodily life transmits itself as an element of novelty throughout the avenues of the body. Its sole use to the body is its vivid origi- nality: it is the organ of novelty."326 It is very important to note Whitehead's contention that the characteristics of a society are, without exception, the characteristics of its component actual entities. That is to say: no new characteristics emerge in the social organization which are not present in the component members.327 Sheldon in his discussion of "Process Philosophy" (by which he means, chiefly, Whitehead's philosophy, though Dewey's is also considered at some length) states that it deals with the mind-body problem "by declaring that one and the same reality is potentially either."328 This is true in the sense that actual entities may constitute either what is ordinarily called body or what is ordinarily called mind. Yet, such actual entities would have vastly different types of experience. However, having made his general point, Sheldon proceeds to express a very inaccurate notion. "But what is this reality that is either mind or body? Ex- perience, they say. And experience means the things, the sticks and stones, storms, stars, the thoughts and deeds of men, etc."329 As a matter of fact, the "things" listed are complex societies of actual entities. They are, as such, not the ultimate realities which are potentially mind or body. As has been noted, actual entities are the ultimate reality. The criticism has been offered that Whitehead really does not account for the 323 A. I., p. 264. 324 See P. R., p. 166 and in general the discussion of the "autonomy" of actual entities. 325 P. R., p. 116. 326 P. R., p. 516. See a more complete discussion of this topic in; A. H. Johnson, The Psychology of A. N. Whitehead, The Journal of General Psychology, Vol. 32 (1945). 327 See A.

Thus, Emmet asks: "What reason is there for a route of actual entities, if they are simply atomic and perishing, to reproduce the same form, so that we may recognize the route, and call it an 'enduring object' (society), such as a stone, or a leaf, or a man's life?"330 It seems that Whitehead's only answer to such a question is: I am offering a description of what I find actually happening. Beyond that I cannot go. It will be obvious that Murphy is guilty of gross misunderstanding of White- head's theory of society when he remarks that "stones, which are not themselves such actualities (actual entities), but are rather eternal objects of a special type, would be 'vacuously actual' if they were conceived to exist in their own right and not, as in the philosophy of organism, as ingredient in these more concrete and dynamic ultimate actualities."331 The erroneousness of this statement of this is due to the fact that, contrary to Murphy's contention, stones are not eternal objects. They are societies of actual entities. Hence, they are not vacuously actual unless they are included in actual entities. To repeat, they are societies of actual entities. In discussing the relationships of actual entities Whitehead introduces the con- cept of "extensive continuum". "This extensive continuum is one relational complex in which all potential objectifications find their niche." More specifi- cally, "an extensive continuum is a complex of entities united by the various allied relationships-. It is not a fact prior to the world; it is the first deter- mination of order; that is, of real potentiality, arising out of the general character of the world."332 In other words, Whitehead is referring to the fact that when a new actual entity arises it has available a group of data arranged in a specific fashion because the data are provided by a group of actual entities in various co- operative relationships. Thus, the extensive continuum is not an underlying or all inclusive entity. The term refers to the fact that data are available in a definite complex fashion. Blyth argues that there is a serious deficiency in Whitehead's theory of the extensive continuum. "According to the subjectivist principle any real fact about the universe must be found in the analysis of the experience of an actual entity.... in the experience of an actual entity surveying the world from a stand- point we find only a limited continuum of entities. Such a limited continuum is relative to the standpoint from which it is experienced and does not, of course, include all possible standpoints.-Now as we have already seen, there is nothing apart from the experience of actual entities, and all actual entities occupy stand- points. Consequently, we cannot find among their prehensions or feeling an experience of an extensive continuum which expresses the solidarity of all pos- sible standpoints. It is thus clear that Whitehead can retain the notion of the extensive continuum only in violation of the subjectivist principle."333 As a 330 Emmet, p. 186 (material in brackets mine).

R., p. 103. 333 Blyth, pp. 33-4. 289</page><page sequence="54">A. H. JOHNSON matter of fact, contrary to Blyth, this is not at all clear. Actually, Whitehead is not forsaking the subjectivist principle. Each standpoint is the standpoint of an actual entity. There are many actual entities. Therefore, there are many standpoints. Obviously, the totality of this set of standpoints exists even though there is no impartial actual entity which experiences all of them. As has been noted above, the extensive continuum has the characteristic of order because of the co-operative activity of the actual entities which compose it. Several discussions of Whitehead's philosophy make the claim that he is an exponent of emergent evolution. For example, Gentry contends that Whitehead states "the primary relatedness of actualities in terms of the theory of emergent evolutionism which conceives of actualities as arising out of the matrix of ele- ments to which it is related, i.e., as being a function of other things."334 Needham quotes at length from Whitehead's writings to make the same point. In particu- lar he notes the statement that "a thorogoing evolutionary philosophy-cries aloud for a conception of organism as fundamental for nature-the organism is a unit of emergent value."335 The implication is that Whitehead is sympathetic to the philosophy of emergent evolution and feels that his theory of organism is a metaphysical basis for this point of view. His suggestion that diverse modes of functioning are produced by diverse modes of organization336 provides an apparent further support for the theory that Whitehead accepts emergent evolution. However, it must be noted that Whitehead's general position does not accord with several important features of the theory of emergent evolution as formulated by Alexander and Lloyd Morgan. Their emphasis on an underlying "nisus" or "deity" which is the ultimate cause of the emergence of new kinds of existence337 is foreign to Whitehead's emphasis on the self-creative function of each actual entity. As has been obvious from previous discussion, Whitehead contends that God does not exercise ultimate control. Further, though in Whitehead's opinion new entities emerge, the process is not as mysterious as some emergent evolu- tionists contend. He describes in detail how a novel actual entity comes into being, the whole process being guided by its subjective aim. Whitehead's philosophy is known as the "philosophy of organism". It is im- portant to note the meaning which he assigns to this phrase. Whitehead uses the term "organism" in two chief senses. (i) An actual entity is an organism. "Each actual entity is itself only describable as an organic process.-It is a process proceeding from phase to phase, each phase being the real basis from which its successor proceeds toward the completion of the things in question."338 (ii) "The community of actual things is an organism-an organism is a nexus."339 This is what Whitehead has in mind when he suggests that there are "organisms of organisms".340 334 Gentry, p. 194. 835 S.

The remaining section of this article is attempt to state criticisms which in the opinion of the author legitimately apply to Whitehead's theory of actual entities. (1) In the first place Whitehead is sometimes careless in expressing his philo- sophical ideas. (a) On occasion he makes statements which are not in accord with his actual position, as defined accurately. As has been noted, he sometimes refers to eternal objects as sensa, though he really means to say that sensa are exemplifications of eternal objects. In discussing God he terms God's primordial nature an actual entity and assigns consciousness to God's consequent nature. As a matter of fact, he means that God, in his entirety as a union of primordial and consequent natures, is an actual entity. Under certain conditions, God ex- periences consciousness. (b) In other instances his statements are misleading because of ambiguity, though a careful reading of context makes possible the grasping of his real meaning. For example, there are his references to "creativ- ity" which seem to imply that it is the fundamental reality possessing ultimate causal power. This, however, is not what he really means. His discussion of the "relational function" of eternal objects seems to imply that eternal objects, as such, constitute the linkage between actual entities. What actually happens in most cases is a transfer of concrete contents, which exemplify eternal objects. (2) There seems to be a drastic difference between God and other (ordinary) actual entities. (a) An ordinary actual entity "perishes" when it is complete. Its life endures for only a brief period.341 On the other hand, God has "the property of combining creative advance with the retention of mutual immedi- acy."342 In other words, God endures. (b) This claim concerning God gives rise to another phase of the argument that God is different from other actual entities. Although God is supposed to provide data for objectification in other actual entities yet he cannot do so in the fashion of ordinary actual entities because they function only when they have perished subjectively while God sup- posedly never undergoes this subjective perishing. (c) Whitehead himself points out that "God differs from other actual entities in the fact that Hume's principle of the derivative character of conceptual feelings, does not hold for him."343 That is to say, God's primordial nature involves an envisagement of all eternal objects, which are thus available for the use of other actual entities. They select some of these for exemplification in their experience. God does not have to seek eternal objects from some other source as is the case with other actual entities. (d) The subjective aim of an ordinary actual entity may undergo change. God's subjective aim (his eternal envisagement and his interest in the maximum richness of life for all actual entities) remains unchanged. These obvious differences be- tween Whitehead's description of ordinary actual entities and his description of 341 P. R., p. 126. 342 P. R., p. 524. 343 P. R., p. 134. 291</page><page sequence="56">A. H. JOHNSON God lead one to question his statement that "God is not to be treated as an exception to all metaphysical principles, invoked to save their collapse. He is their chief exemplification."344 However, it must be admitted that some under- standing of the unique experiences which Whitehead attributes to God may be derived from an examination of the experience of an ordinary human being (the sort of experience which is the basis of Whitehead's theory of the nature of ordinary actual entities). For example, our knowledge of our "specious present" gives us some insight into what an eternal specious present would be like, an experience in which there would be the retention of immediacy and creative advance. (3) Whitehead's basic contention that the characteristics found in human experience will also be present in all actual entities seems open to serious objection. It is difficult to accept Whitehead's claim that stones are composed of entities which are constituted by feelings, particularly conceptual feelings, and that these feelings are guided by subjective aim and manifest subjective form. Is this not anthropomorphism and animism?345 True, Whitehead claims that our experience of the physical world supports his position. Further, he argues that only on the basis of his general point of view can man be at home in the universe. Also it must be remembered that physicists cannot agree on the ultimate nature of physical reality. It may be that Whitehead is correct in his contention. (4) Whitehead's claim that there can be feeling, both physical and conceptual as well as subjective aim and subjective form, without consciousness being present seems open to serious objection. It is true that Whitehead uses the term con- sciousness in a special sense-the contrast of theory with fact. This perhaps removes most of the sting from the obvious criticism but the fact remains that there seems little justification for this specialized use of the term consciousness. Whitehead might profitably have invented a new term to apply to the process which he calls consciousness. (5) Vehement objection has been directed against Whitehead's doctrine that a "subject" or actual entity is the emergent result of its feelings-is constituted by them. Or to express this in another fashion: An actual entity is not some- thing which exists prior to its feelings and originates them.346 As a matter of fact, an examination of human experience seems to indicate that there is more involved than Whitehead reports. It is true that a subject is built up by its feelings; but there seems to be something which possesses the feelings, something more than the sum of the feelings. There is a "center" which, in reacting to other centers has feelings (to use Whitehead's term). The fact that these feelings are characterized by subjective form and are guided by subjective aim is due to the 344 P. R., p. 521. 345 See C. Lloyd Morgan, Subjective Aim in Professor Whitehead's Philosophy, Journal of Philosophical Studies, Vol. 6 (1931), pp. 285-9. Sheldon, pp. 142-5; J. E. Boodin, Fic- tions in Science and Philosophy, The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. XL (1943), pp. 703-4; M. W. Gross, Book Review: The Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead (P. A.

Johnson, The Intel- ligibility of Whitehead's Philosophy, Philosophy of Science, Vol. X (1943), pp. 52-3. 292</page><page sequence="57">WHITEHEAD'S THEORY OF ACTUAL ENTITIES nature of the subject. While its feelings modify the nature of the subject, they cannot occur unless it is present to possess them. To repeat: the human subject seems to be more than the sum of integrated feelings.347 As Gentry has pointed out, Whitehead seems to assign to feelings the prop- erties and functions of an existant substantial subject.348 He is incorrect, how- ever, in his claim that Whitehead assigns subjective aim to feelings as such.349 The objection that Whitehead does not offer an adequate description of the human subject applies most obviously to his analysis of adult human experience. It is possible that his position is, in a general fashion, correct as a description of one phase of human experience. There does seem to be a stage in the early development of a child when self-hood emerges out of a welter of experiences-is constituted by them.350 But it is very doubtful whether the details of White- head's analysis apply here, e.g. conceptual prehension and subjective aim. How- ever, it should not be forgotten that the experience of "conversion" in any field of human experience, does seem to involve the emergence of a novel adult subject. Yet the fact remains that the appearance of new subjects out of old does not occur with the regularity and frequency claimed by Whitehead. (6) The preceding comment brings us to a further objection to Whitehead's theory of the nature of actual entities. He claims that an occasion of experience has a very brief duration. He argues that subjects rise and very quickly pass away. The so-called "self" is in reality a society-a temporal series of actual entities. In taking this position Whitehead seems to overlook the factor of endurance which characterizes the human self. The self which has its subjective aim and guides its process of feeling does not endure for a brief instant and then fade out. Its component feelings are of brief duration but the self, with its subjective aim, may last for fifty years. True, it changes as its experiences change, as different feelings rise and pass away. The man of sixty-five is not the boy of fifteen. But, one subjective aim may be the guiding principle of his fifty years of experience. In a real sense the self at the end of fifty years of experience is the same self. But, since the self has been enriched by this experi- ence, it is in this sense different from what it was at the age of fifteen. It must, of course, be admitted that all subjects do not endure as long as fifty years. However, the fact remains that the existence of a human subject does not seem to be as brief as Whitehead contends. To this extent his analysis of human experi- ence is incorrect.35' (7) An examination of human experience also casts some doubt on White- head's theory of objectification. He contends that in some cases this involves a literal transfer of content from one actual entity to another, for example, the same angry feeling is transferred from a perishing actual entity to a newly arising 347 See Gentry, p. 176; Das, p. 185; Lintz, p. 51; and in particular, J. B. Pratt, Personal Realism, Chaps. 19-20. 318 See Gentry, pp. 178-9. 349 See P. R., p. 29. 350 Here I disagree with Pratt who suggests that the self is "already real in the first conscious stirrings of the new born, or the unborn infant. "Personal Realism", p. 298. 351 See J. B. Pratt, Personal Realism, p. 282. 293</page><page sequence="58">A. H. JOHNSON actual entity. Is it not legitimate to suggest that since the actual entity which originally held the anger is different from the newly arising actual entity, that, therefore, the identically same anger cannot be present in both actual entities? This point is particularly relevant in view of Whitehead's insistence that no two actual entities can be exactly alike.352 (8) Whitehead contends that actual entities are "causa sui". Each actual entity determines which data shall be accepted and how these data shall be experienced. Is it not obvious that Whitehead is unduly optimistic concerning the powers of resistance possessed by human subjects (the prototype of all actual entities)? Is it not true that most, perhaps all, actual entities can conceivably be brought to the point where they can no longer resist the necessity of bowing to the pressure of externally imposed data? The files of the Gestapo are likely to provide evidence in support of this argument. At this point the general question may be raised as to whether Whitehead, in his examination of human experience, has taken into serious consideration the fact of individual differences. (9) According to Whitehead a society of actual entities possesses only those characteristics which are to be found in its (some or all) component actual en- tities. If this theory is to be taken in absolute literalness rather strange conse- quences will follow. It will be necessary, for example, to claim that a table is square because some of its component actual entities manifest the eternal object squareness. If a saw is used to make the table-top round, then supposedly some (at least) of the component actual entities would be replaced by actual entities which had, with one accord, decided to exemplify the eternal object "roundness". To put it mildly, this does not seem very plausible. There is a further difficulty. In attempting to trace back all characteristics of a society to some or all of the component actual entities, Whitehead overlooks the fact that frequently the whole is more than the sum of its parts; or to express it in another fashion, White- head seems to be overlooking creative emergence. CONCLUSION It is to be noted that the objections outlined above are not directed against some of the basic insights on which Whitehead's philosophy is reared. However, exception is taken to the way in which he has attempted to express these insights. Whitehead has stressed the contention that there is an ultimate plurality of concrete, real, interrelated entities. They exist in a world characterized by both change and endurance, a world in which choice makes a difference, and values are not reduced to some subjective or relative process.353 These insights White- head shares with many serious thinkers in all ages. Contrary to the modern "drift from reason", despite his recognition of the blind alleys into which a pseudo-rationalism has led its befuddled devotees, Whitehead is prepared to use a chastened reason, enlightened by examination of matters of fact. In his refusal to attribute relentless power to God Whitehead ranges himself on the side of 352 P. R., p. 28. 353 A. H. Johnson, "Truth, Beauty and Goodness" in the Philosophy of A. N. White- head, Philosophy of Science, Vol. XI (1944), particularly pp. 14-15. 294</page><page sequence="59">WHITEHEAD'S THEORY OF ACTUAL ENTITIES 295 those who find it impossible to accept the fact of evil and at the same time assign absolute power as well as absolute goodness to God. (Incidently, Whitehead contends that he is giving metaphysical expression to the insight of the "carpenter of Nazareth".) Whitehead's contention that God is a genuine object of experi- ence places him among the opponents of Humanism. His claim that categories applied to ordinary actual entities may also be applied to God (though more revision is necessary than Whitehead seems to realize) marks the strong contrast between his position and that typified by Barth. However, despite the agreement with Whitehead's general point of view, as outlined in the preceding paragraph, the author of this article has found it neces- sary, on the basis of an examination of his experience, of "himself", other selves, and so-called physical objects, to question the validity of some of the essential phases of Whitehead's exposition of these insights. The chief objection has to do with Whitehead's contention that the characteristics found in the analysis of a "moment" of human experience are also found in all other "actual entities".
