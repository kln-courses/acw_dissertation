The relation of the civilization of Crete and of Mycenae to that of .the geometric and succeeding periods is an outstanding problem. Two views are held: Roden- waldt assumes a complete break between the culture of the bronze-age and that of subsequent epochs; Gisela Weyde is a recent adherent of the contrary view that geometric art is a direct outgrowth from that of Crete. The author of this book follows in the main Camillo Praschniker (Jahr. fuer Kunstgeschichte, 1923, p. 14 ff.), in avoiding either extreme. The book is divided into four chapters to which is added an excursus. The first and longest chapter is concerned with the survival of Late Mycenaean elements in the art of the geometric period. In Mycenaean pottery (the study is limited to vases), a different principle of decoration is used from that employed in the cul- minating periods of Cretan naturalism; the decoration is not applied freely to the entire surface of the vase as in Crete, but is arranged with regard to the supporting and supported parts of the vase, the shoulder carrying the main frieze, and the decoration of the lower parts of the vase being confined to horizontal stripes. Such an arrangement remained in effect throughout the geometric period. The practice of dividing the main frieze into metopes and of emphasizing the axial members of the design is again carried over from the Mycenaean to subsequent periods. Among the individual patterns which survive from one period to the next are the wavy line, the wedge motive, and combined groups of perpendicular and horizon- tal lines. Among the shapes which persist are a small jug with a funnel-like mouth, a jug with trefoil spout, the bowl, the cup, various types of amphoras, the hydria and the kalathos. The conclusion is thus that geometric art is based on a sub- stantial heritage from the Mycenaean period, a conclusion born out by the fact, mentioned in the introduction, that Schweitzer's list of geometric sites corresponds with Fimmen's list of settlements of the Bronze Age. The second chapter deals with the disappearance and reappearance of ornament. A delight in contrasts of light and dark in closely applied patterns is characteristic, according to the author, of both the Late Minoan and late geometric periods of Crete. To the reviewer, the illustrations cited are not strikingly analogous; the motives of the design as the author admits are quite different, as is also the arrange- ment of the zones of ornament. Here as elsewhere the book suffers from the</page><page sequence="2">522 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY absence of illustrations. The reader is constantly referred to drawings or half-tone reproductions of groups of vases, in which particular designs are scarcely discerni- ble. The suggestion made in this chapter, however, that patterns (like the spiral) which suffer a temporary eclipse in ceramic art may remain in use for metal-work or for woven stuffs is entirely sound. A system of decoration that disappears to return again is that which the author calls anthropomorphic. Here again the ar- gument is scarcely convincing. That nipples are indicated on the shoulders of Late Mycenaean and geometric vases after a long period of disuse is true, but that this implies that the potters who thus embellished their pots were impelled by the same "Kunstwollen" as were those of an earlier period is open to doubt. Do not potters, of all occidental lands at least, speak of the foot, the shoulder, the mouth of their pots? Certainly few will agree with the author that "die Einseitige Ver- zierung der Gefaesse der Akropolisgattung ist ein Ergebnis der anthropomorphen Tendenz." The last two chapters treat of the relation of Late Mycenaean art to that of the early culture of the mainland. The conclusion is that in the Late Mycenaean period when the supremacy of Cretan art came to an end with its entirely different system of decoration (derived ultimately from the east), the older northern scheme of ornament was left free to reassert itself, and the "anthropomorphic" system again prevailed in which the main zone of ornament was confined to the shoulder, and the lower part of the vase was decorated with horizontal lines. The late Mycenaean period is not, however, a period of degeneration of naturalistic decora- tion; rather the bold curves and realistic renderings of plant and marine life which characterize Minoan art are compressed and ordered according to the mainland sense for form. The author does not, however, adhere to the old theory of a Bauernkunst in that he considers the art of the Late Mycenaean period as a voluntary cre- ation, too revolutionary to be regarded as the outcome of meager survivals. The result of this argument is orthodox enough; archaeologists have generally agreed that in the early centuries of the second millennium B.C., Minoan influence prevailed, whereas, after 1500 B.C. the tide turned and the influence of the main- land became predominate (cf., e.g., Blegen, Korakou, p. 125). The author, how- ever, leaves out one part of the picture; in Crete as well as on the mainland, there prevailed before the rise of the Cretan naturalistic school a linear style, analogous to that of the Cyclades and of the mainland, in which the shoulder of the vase carried the main zone of ornament. The course of decorative art ran through ap- proximately the same stages in the Argolid, Corinthia, the Cyclades, and Crete, as if the culture of all these places was closely akin. The trend toward naturalism in Crete may have been due not only to the quickening influence of Egypt and the Orient, but also to the fact that the island was less troubled by foreign invaders. The evidence of Zygouries shows that at the end of the Early Helladic period on the mainland settlements were overwhelmed by catastrophic changes while in Crete Early Minoan art was blossoming into the artistic creations of the Middle Minoan I period. And finally the assumption, popular of late, that syntax of design is a trust- worthy hall-mark of a culture, or that it remains constant through centuries of time is by no means certain. The intricate relations of the different branches and periods of Aegean culture will be better elucidated by the careful excavation of more sites than by the comparison of designs remote in time and place. The excursus reiterates, in reply to Schweitzer, the connections of geometric art with that of the Late Mycenaean period. EDITH HALL DOHAN PHILADELPHIA, PA.</page></plain_text>
