<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition, by Gershom G. Scholem. New York: The Jewish Theological Seminary, 1960. Pp. vii+126. $4.00. In this extraordinarily important book (based on his Goldstein lectures at the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1957) Professor Scholem examines the evidence for the existence of a secret tradition, including magical practice as well as mystical teaching, within the rabbinic Judaism of the first centuries A.D. What makes the book important is the fact that he not only finds reports of the existence of such a tradition - these had often been discredited - but also succeeds in demonstrating that some of the content of the tradition is preserved in what he calls the Hekhaloth Books, that is, the books about the palaces or temples of the heavens. The principal texts included in these books consist of the songs or spells which must be said by the mystic or magician who would ascend through the heavens to the throne of God, directions on how to prepare for the ascent, and an account of the way and its dangers, with special attention to the angelic guards of the various heavens and the magical names and seals which one must use to get by them. There are also sections of what is called Shiur Komah material - speculations as to the colossal dimensions of an anthropomorphic deity. Scholem has shown that the literary form of the songs is at least as old as the third century A.D. and that almost all the other elements of the tradition - including the Shiur Komah specula- tions - were to be found in Jewish material of the second century or earlier. If this were all, it would already be a great deal: It would show that behind the legal and prosaic facade of rabbinic Judaism there were secret circles experimenting with religious practices of a quite different character. But there is more: Scholem has also demonstrated that the basic ideas and many of the details of this literature are closely paralleled in the Pseudepigrapha and in early Christian, gnostic, and magical material. Further, he has shown that the magical and gnostic borrowings of Jewish material, and the Jewish borrowings of magical and gnostic material, are alike without any important trace of Christian contamination. Therefore he concludes that they must all derive from some common stock which existed at the latest in the early first century A.D. This common stock must have been a mystical/magical Judaism pro- foundly shaped by Greco-oriental thought and presumably the product of a develop- ment which started in the late Hellenistic or early Roman period. Moreover, it must have been an important and widespread development, for nothing less could explain the wide ramification, diversity, and importance of the traces of its influence. The impact of this conclusion is augmented by the fact that it is strikingly similar to the conclusion reached by Goodenough from his study of the archeological remains. Scholem's work has been based on material almost entirely different from that used by Goodenough, and further differences of method, background, and temperament make it practically impossible that Goodenough's previous work should have exercised any considerable influence on Scholem's present book. Therefore the coincidence of their conclusions is particularly impressive. From now on, students of early Christianity must reckon with the fact that, before Christianity began, important mystical/magical elements were current as secret tradition within significant circles of Palestinian Judaism. Scholem's study is all the more impressive because it is carried out with the extra- ordinary breadth of learning and the meticulous scholarship for which he is famous. 190</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS Finally, to cap off the book, its appendices include a new edition of a Jewish magical inscription, formerly misinterpreted by Dupont-Sommer, the first edition of an impor- tant hekhaloth tract (from MSS in Oxford and the Jewish Theological Seminary), and a most valuable essay (in Hebrew) by Dean Saul Lieberman, on the midrash to the Song of Songs. MORTON SMITH COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY A Historical Approach to the New Testament, by Frederic R. Crownfield. New York: Harper, 1960. Pp. xii+420. $5.50. This fine introduction to NT literature for college students does exactly what it promises: in nontechnical language it surveys the methods, the problems, and the commonly accepted conclusions of the so-called historical approach to the NT. The main emphasis is intended to be on "what the authors of the various parts of the New Testament were trying to say" (p. xi), but such an intention becomes operative only in chap. 9 and then relevant again in chap. 12 to 14. The organization of the various chapters is matterful, and the reader is not dis- turbed by the transition from methods and problems to sources and texts, and then to evaluation. The only chapter which should have been treated differently seems to be 15 on "Sources," for it appears to belong either with the preceding or the following. Although it may jolt some readers to see the word "acquitted" (p. 301) used as a synonym for "justified" in the Pauline terminology, Crownfield has fully understood Paul and has done an excellent job in presenting the most significant things briefly. Only occasionally does the treatment become so brief that it might better be omitted entirely; e. g., "Lectionaries" in six lines (p. 29)! The statement that Tertullian "was the first to use the expression 'New Testa- ment' " (p. 5) should be clarified and qualified. It is stated that Paul's letters as a corpus "came to be referred to by various writers, not long after the beginning of the second century, as Scripture, although they do not seem at first to have been put quite on a par with the gospels or the Old Testament" (p. 6). I should like to know who these writers were and see their writings, for I know of none till the end of the century. It becomes important because it is the sole reason for dating II Peter "not long before A.D. 150" (p. 329). I know of none before Irenaeus of Lyons who did use Paul's letters obviously not only as a corpus, but as Holy Scripture; but even here it has to be proved rather laboriously over the objections of some, e. g., Johannes Werner (Der Paulinismus des Irenaeus, 1889). This is the only example of a statement concerning the existence of "evidence" which I have found to be untenable in the entire book. It is the exception which demonstrates the rule of accuracy in the book. The undergraduate who uses this book can use it with confidence and trust and consider himself fortunate that so much work has been done for him in so many areas. R. E.
