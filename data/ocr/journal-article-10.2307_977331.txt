<plain_text><page sequence="1">127 Recovering the Public Management Variable: Lessons from Schools, Prisons, and Armies gg He---_ John J. Dilufio, Jr., Princeton University Although a disputatious lot, public management schol- ars tend to agree strongly (if implicitly) on one thing: pub- lic management matters. They share a belief ("faith" might be a better word) that how public organizations are managed has a significant bearing on how, and how well, those organizations perform. They assume that how pub- lic executives, managers, and line workers behave affects significantly what and how much their organizations pro- duce in the way of public safety, health, education, envi- ronmental protection, national security, and so on. This assumption undergirds every public administration text and many books and articles on the organization of the White House, Congress, and the lesser bodies that form each institution. The discussion here focuses not on individual public executives or managers1 but on what may be termed the "public management variable." The general argument is that the immediate future of public management studies ought to lie largely in exploratory efforts at "recovering" this variable, which means defining it, measuring it, and specifying the conditions (if any) under which it matters to the actual quality of citizens' lives, either in conjunction with or independent of variables that are not directly relat- ed to how public organizations are led, structured, and coordinated. The approach proposed here is (1) directed by explicit normative concerns, (2) focused on concrete public policy problems, and (3) dedicated to improving public service. The working image of public organizations is as the "hands and feet" of important public purposes. A ques- tion, perhaps the question, to ask about any public organi- zation is: What public ends ought it to achieve, and how can it best achieve them? There is, of course, absolutely nothing new or fancy in this conception of public organizations and how to study them. In some respects, it harkens back to a tradition in political science and public administration scholarship that predates even "ancient" New Public Administration con- ferees.2 At one level, the effort to recapture the public management variable is part of the "return to the state"3 in political science, meaning essentially a return to studies in which the behavior of government officials, acting in accordance with their own preferences, is viewed as an independent variable that can affect policy choices, imple- mentation decisions, and policy outcomes. At another level, it is part of the "new institutionalism"4 in political science, meaning essentially an approach to the study of political institutions that embodies some or all of the fol- lowing: (1) a resistance to the notion that political institu- tions can be understood mainly or solely in terms of patterns of interaction among rational, self-interested indi- viduals and groups; (2) an unwillingness to be swept away by the elegant representations of that notion as they appear in the work of formal (mathematical) theorists; (3) an embrace of the idea that political institutions are to a large degree self-determining, or, so to speak, have a life of their own; (4) a concomitant belief that these institutions are often, though not always, as capable of shaping the social and economic forces that swirl about them as these forces are of shaping the institutions; and (5) a rejection of fatal- ism and determinism in human affairs. Does public management matter? Under what, if any, conditions does how public organizations are led, structured, and coordinated affect the quality of citizens' lives? This exploratory essay recommends an approach to public management studies that is directed at answering these questions and "recovering" the public management variable. Using examples from the recent literature on schools, prisons, and armies and drawing on various theo- retical literatures, it is argued that the future of public management studies should lie in efforts to specify what ends given public organizations ought to achieve and how best to achieve them. MARCH/APRIL 1989</page><page sequence="2">128 PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW The "new institutionalism" should take shape as an approach to public management studies that directs schol- ars (1) to observe how members at every level of an orga- nization "really behave," (2) to relate systematically these observations to the formal character of the organization in order to see what (if any) connections exist, and (3) to search systematically for the connections (if any) between organizational activities and real-world outcomes. This approach requires the kind of willingness to immerse oneself in administrative life that is implied by the methodological rubric "participant observation." The most apt description of "participant observation" comes from Richard F. Fenno's study of House members in their districts: "soaking and poking--or just hanging around."'5 But especially where the attempt to discover connections between "management" and "outcomes" is concerned, it may also involve a willingness (not to mention ability) to engage in high-powered quantitative analysis of one stripe or another--soaking, poking, and computing. There are many rich case studies of administrative life, most of them published as books. And then there are jour- nal articles such as those contained in the post-1970 edi- tions of Administrative Science Quarterly. The former score big on the participant-observation dimension, tend- ing to be descriptive, qualitative, and (here and there) the- oretically informed. The latter score big on the quantitative analysis dimension, with numerous mono- graphs measuring the performance of organizations with- out establishing the least idea of how or by whom the organizations were managed. The approach advocated here, however, is something more than a badly needed bridge between these two ways of approaching public management studies. It aims to do something that neither approach does (at least not consis- tently); namely, to integrate closely the empirical and nor- mative dimensions of research on public organizations. The first step in any analysis would be to argue that the agency under study ought to achieve certain ends and to embody certain values. In the main, the research would be dedicated to discovering the relationship (if any) between these ends and the way that the organization is led, struc- tured, and coordinated. In other words, it would examine the efficacy of the public management variable in relation to carefully specified performance criteria. In this approach, any pretension to "value-free" or "eth- ically neutral" public management scholarship would be abandoned without remorse. In the simplest form, suc- cessful research would conclude in a statement to the effect that "For these reasons, public organization X ought to achieve goals A, B, and C, and research demonstrates that the best way to manage it toward these ends is thus and so." If the empirical analysis is competent, then those who oppose goals A, B, and C would find the research useful as a source of knowledge about how to frustrate their realization. And if in any given study it turns out that the efficacy of public management is called into question because carefully documented variations in management practices bear little or no connection to real-world out- comes, then academicians will have learned something that is empirically true and intellectually interesting, if not practically useful or morally instructive. The public management variable will be "recovered" once a reliable stock of generalizations exists about how, whether, and to what extent different types of management practices matter to the quality of citizens' lives, and what (if anything) can be done to change the management of given public organizations in ways that are likely to achieve specified public purposes. Some works in the literature on public organizations-- particularly parts of the recent literature on schools, pris- ons, and military units--are small cobblestones on the path to recovering the public management variable. Effective Schools Just over twenty years ago, James Coleman wrote a federal government-sponsored report entitled Equality for Educational Opportunity.6 In essence, Coleman and his colleagues argued that differences in the readily measur- able features of schools--expenditures, amount of teacher training, and the like--had virtually no effect on academic achievement once one controlled for the family back- grounds of the pupils. Since the federal government had been, in the critics' vernacular, "throwing money" at the "education problem," the report was viewed as evidence that the money was being wasted. The critics, however, suffered an intellectual (if not rhetorical) setback as the report received a much-deserved thrashing for its method- ological messiness. But Coleman kept active in this area of research. In 1982, for instance, he was the lead author of High School Achievement: Public, Catholic, and Private Schools Compared.7 In general, this study found that private and Catholic school children were better at reading, writing, and reasoning than comparable public school children, even when more money per capita, more modern facilities, and more educated teachers were used by the latter. Many studies now suggest that student performance on standardized tests and other measures of educational attainment are largely a function of school management, which is defined in terms of such hard-to-measure factors as how teachers structure their classes, how principals lead their teachers, and how superintendents coordinate their principals. In popular and scholarly discourse, these works are often lumped together and called the "effective schools" literature.8 This literature deepens one's faith in the efficacy of the public management variable. Broadly stated, if society's goal is to make students literate and social, then it matters greatly how the schools are man- aged. The studies indicate that simply paying teachers more, "tinkering" with testing devices, or "fiddling" with pupil-to-teacher ratios does not work. How, then, does one go about improving the schools? Most of the "effective schools" research done to date sug- gests that the answer is to hire, retain, and promote teach- ers and school administrators who are bright, compassionate, and share an extraordinary dedication to MARCH/APRIL 1989</page><page sequence="3">RECOVERING THE PUBLIC MANAGEMENT VARIABLE 129 duty. Indeed, the literature can be read to imply that, in the absence of an expanding pool of teachers and school administrators who are blessed with unique and nontrans- ferable talents, "effective schools" are impossible. Better research, however, might yield more cogent and useful generalizations. "Effective schools" studies should yield to "efficacy of school management" studies. The nearest example is John E. Chubb's ongoing work with Terry M. Moe.9 Unlike most of the "effective schools" lit- erature, Chubb's and Moe's study combines extensive sur- vey research with impressions drawn from field experiences reported in the secondary literature. Also unlike most other researchers in this field, they measure school performance strictly in terms of pupils' achieve- ments on a battery of standardized tests, accepting the schools' value as instruments of socialization and civics training as important but secondary. In brief, they find that high-performance and low-per- formance schools vary little in terms of size, teacher-pupil ratios, teacher salaries, teacher experience, teacher turnover rates, and basic classroom practices (amount of homework, responses to disruptive student behavior, etc.). There are, however, major differences in terms of student backgrounds and the organization of the schools. Students in top schools have parents with higher incomes and asso- ciated socioeconomic advantages. "Much less pre- dictably," writes Chubb, "schools at the top have strikingly superior organizations": clearer goals that are oriented toward "academic excellence" and not simply "the basics"; more cohesive staff with a more developed sense of pro- fessional mission; more forceful and accomplished princi- pals who manage democratically. Schools that have "team management" outperform schools that have "hierarchical" management. Chubb stresses: "School organization, then, has an important effect on learning. All other things being equal, attending an effectively organized school is worth at least a full year of additional achieve- ment over attendance at an ineffectively organized school."IO Though serious questions can be raised about their con- ceptualizations of formal elements and their selection of performance criteria, and though their effort appears to be rather anemic with respect to participant observation, their work on schools can be taken as a good preliminary effort to recover the public management variable. Well-Governed Prisons No literature is available on prisons that parallels the "effective schools" literature. Most of the research on prisons has been done by sociologists and focuses heavily on the social order of the cellblocks.11 The "ineffective prisons" literature might be the most fitting label for the last five decades of research on prisons. Most works on prisons by sociologists and penologists embody grave doubts about the efficacy of prison manage- ment. Indeed, most of this literature suggests that prison managers can do virtually nothing to improve conditions MARCH/APRIL 1989 behind bars: if prisons develop a distinctive social system along racial and ethnic lines, reinforced by an informal but powerful distribution of authority, then policy makers can do little more than take notice, while prison managers must compromise their formal authority. To the extent that any of these studies relate prison management prac- tices to the quality of life behind bars, the results are mad- dening: prisons that are managed in a tight, authoritarian fashion are plagued by disorder and inadequate programs; prisons that are managed in a loose, "participative" fashion are equally troubled; and "mixed" cellblock management regimes do no better. But general faith in the efficacy of public management, the existence of numerous (though admittedly laughable) "prison administration" textbooks and former wardens' "how-to" memoirs, plus a few quite recent empirical stud- ies of prison management conspire to challenge this per- plexing view of these "barbed-wire bureaucracies." My Governing Prisons: A Comparative Study of Cor- rectional Management reports on three years of explorato- ry research on prison management in the Texas, Michigan, and California Departments of Corrections.12 In sum, that book analyzed intersystem, intrasystem, and historical variations in the quality of prison life, which were mea- sured in terms of three criteria: order (rates of individual and collective violence and other forms of misconduct), amenity (availability of clean cells, decent food, etc.), and service (availability of work opportunities, educational programs, etc.). Using the simplest sort of approach and having weighed the possibility of problems in the data, no evi- dence was found that levels of order, amenity, and service varied directly with any of these factors: a "better class" of inmates; greater per-capita spending; lower levels of crowding; lower inmate-to-staff ratios; greater officer training; more modern plant and equipment; more elabo- rate systems to sensitize official decision makers to the views (especially the grievances) of inmates; more elabo- rate systems to improve inmate-staff and inmate-inmate race relations (including the existence of a more racially "representative" officer force); and a more routine use of repressive measures, including official and quasi-official beatings of "troublemakers" by officers or by designated inmate "trusties." All roads, it seemed, led to the conclusion that the qual- ity of prison life depended mainly on the quality of prison management. This conclusion was teased from a close analysis of the history, politics, penological credo, and administration of each system and was bolstered by two natural experiments in the data. To simplify greatly, prison organizations that were led strongly by a stable team of like-minded executives, structured in a paramili- tary, security-driven, bureaucratic fashion, and coordinated proactively in conjunction with the demands of relevant outside actors (including key legislators, community activists, judges, and overseers) had higher levels of order, amenity, and service than prison organizations that were managed in other ways, even when the former institutions were more crowded, spent less per capita, had higher</page><page sequence="4">130 PUBLIC ADMIINISTRATION REVIEW inmate-to-staff ratios, and so on. The research supported this conclusion: "The onlyfinding of this study that, to me at least, seems indisputable, is that . . . prison manage- ment matters. "13 Other recent studies are part of what may be termed the emerging "well-governed prisons" literature. Bert Useem, analyzing major prison riots in the United States between 1971 and 1986, provides ample evidence that the riots were due mainly to a breakdown in security procedures-- the daily routine of numbering, counting, frisking, locking, contraband control, and cell searches that is the heart of administration in most prisons.14 The main determinants of prison riots are obvious and proximate factors related to the quality of prison management. Crowding, underfund- ing, court intervention, festering inmate-staff or inmate- inmate racial animosities, and other widely cited causes of prison disorders may make riots more likely, but only failed security management makes them 'inevitable.15 In short, how prisons are managed may increase or decrease the probability of an inmate living out his term in a safe, lawful environment. Similarly, my Barbed-Wire Bureaucracy: Politics and Administration in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, 1930- 1988 shows how efficacious prison management can be.16 The Bureau is recognized far and wide as one of the nation's most successful correctional agencies. Almost without exception, its prisons have been safe and humane; they have improved every decade since the agency came into being. There are two popular but false explanations for the Bureau's success relative to state prison systems. The first explanation is that the Bureau has always gotten "a better class of criminals." Historically, however, the Bureau has never held only white-collar offenders; in mid- 1988, for example, 46% of its prisoners had a history of violence; and each year the states transfer many of their "too hard to handle" inmates to "the Feds." The second explanation is that the Bureau's annual per inmate expen- ditures far exceed the states'; in fact, historically the agen- cy has spent almost exactly at the national median. Furthermore, like many state systems, the Bureau has had overcrowding, poorly-designed cellhouses, staff shortages, and other problems that adversely affect the quality of prison life. But the Bureau has met these challenges bet- ter, and with greater consistency, than any other correc- tional agency in the land. The reason: Bureau management. In sum, unlike most state prison systems, the Bureau has had stable and talent- ed executive leadership (only four directors in its first 57 years of existence); a progressive inmate classification system; an elaborate system of audits, transfers, and other internal "checks and balances;" a positive, closely-knit organizational culture; and many other positive features. State and local agencies that have copied Bureau manage- ment practices have improved. For example, recent analy- ses of intrasystem differences in the New York City system document the comparative strengths of "unit man- agement," a form of correctional administration pioneered by the Bureau in which security staff and noncustodial personnel are given responsibility for a wing of an institu- tion and trained to work cohesively.17 In these and other recent studies, prison management emerges as the crucial variable in determining the quality of life behind bars. There are problems with the "well-governed prisons" literature,18 but as was true of the emerging "efficacy of school management" literature, the "well-governed pris- ons" literature helps to light the road to recovery of the public management variable, for it indicates that the quali- ty of confined citizens' lives may be affected greatly by how prisons are managed. Winning Armies The conventional wisdom about conventional warfare has been that good generals, ample supplies, and cohesive fighting units win battles. "Pattons, parts, and platoon pals" spell victory. Defined loosely, a military unit of whatever sort (air, land, water) is "combat effective" if, in a given engagement with a comparable enemy unit, it inflicts greater human and financial costs on the enemy than the enemy inflicts on it. After the Second World War, numerous studies appeared that stressed the importance to combat effective- ness of primary group solidarity and "we-feeling" among soldiers.19 What might be termed the "Huck Finn theory of combat effectiveness" developed.20 These studies found that, like Huck, the average G.I. fought "for his buddy," not to uphold principle by defeating "Fascism" and shedding blood for "the Constitution." In wartime, Edmund Burke's maxim "No cold relation is a zealous citi- zen" could be repeated as "No self-absorbed recruit is a gung-ho soldier." The research gave credence to the cliched movie scene where a group of badly outgunned soldiers are pinned behind piled sandbags, and a lovable but mischievous "grunt," deaf to the pleas of his comrades, rushes grittily to fling himself, live grenade in hand, into an enemy machine gun nest. Since the end of World War II, the experiences of wartime officers and numerous replications of the "Huck Finn" research findings (and probably the movies) led the Pentagon to order changes in recruitment and training reg- imens in each of the services, especially the Army. In sum, the changes were aimed at inculcating the sort of pri- mary-group relations that seemed to be such a spur to combat effectiveness. Units were to be trained together, kept together, and, if the need arose, "shipped out" to fight together.21 There is, however, no systematic evidence in the rele- vant academic research, government reports, or popular accounts to support either the notion that battlefield per- formance is affected significantly (improved or worsened) by the nature of soldiers' primary group affiliations, or the belief that some recruitment and training regimens are more effective than others at fostering such relations or utilizing them "when and where it counts."22 On the other hand, a growing literature exists on the harm to combat effectiveness that is ostensibly done by such organizational characteristics as disjoined command- MARCH/APRIL 1989</page><page sequence="5">RECOVERING THE PUBLIC MANAGEMENT VARIABLE 131 and-control structures, interservice rivalries, wide-ranging civilian control of military operations, incoherent or unde- veloped strategic and tactical doctrines, and so on. Many of these accounts are wonderfully detailed, colorful, and moving.23 None, however, provides much in the way of systematic evidence that such factors have, do, or inevitably must prove detrimental (or beneficial) to com- bat effectiveness. Indeed, the relationship between key upper-level organizational features such as the composi- tion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on the one hand, and fighting effectiveness, on the other, appears to be more debated than studied.24 The commandant of the Marine Corps, General Alfred M. Gray, was in the process in 1988 of revamping the ser- vice's pre- and in-service training regimens.25 He believed that for the service to be effective, no Marine should be confined strictly to a desk job, that more rigor- ous training of the "break-them-down-and-build-them- back-up" variety is necessary, and that roving, hands-on leadership is essential. In short, he believed in a "back-to- basics" approach as the cure for the ostensibly poor (or poorer than in the past) performance of Marines in combat situations from Vietnam to Lebanon. The general may be right; other experienced "warriors" and military adminis- trators, however, disagreed with his approach--but no sys- tematic combat effectiveness research on Marines exists to tell whether the commandant or his critics were nearer to the truth. With respect to the kind of public management studies being advocated here, the battlefield is clearly an open field. There are, however, a handful of published studies that fire in the desired direction, chief among them William Darryl Henderson's Cohesion: The Human Ele- ment in Combat.26 Henderson compares the armies of the United States, Israel, North Vietnam, and the Soviet Union. As implied by the book's title, he moves from the "Huck Finn theory," but goes well beyond previous studies in attempting to define, measure, and document the effect of primary group relations on combat effectiveness. In brief, he defines "unit cohesion" in terms of (1) the unit's ability to provide for the soldier's basic needs (food, water, affection, self- esteem, etc.), (2) the unit's ability to make the soldier per- ceive that all courses for leaving the unit (discharge, transfer, AWOL, desertion, et cetera) are problematical or closed, (3) the unit's ability to maintain personnel stability (e.g., use of a unit rotation system rather than individual replacements) and to inculcate norms of group identifica- tion, trust, and loyalty via ceremonies, insignia, placing control over passes and leaves in the hands of the immedi- ate leaders of the individual soldier (never beyond the sec- tion or company level), and so on. Unit leaders act to achieve congruence between unit norms and broader orga- nizational objectives. In his view, unit cohesion normally varies somewhat with the degree to which unit leaders succeed in forming positive personal relationships with soldiers. Henderson measures "unit cohesion" and related factors in the four armies mentioned above. His analysis will win MARCH/APRIL 1989 no prizes for methodological elegance, but it nevertheless goes a long way toward explaining why the 1965-1972 war between the United States and the North Vietnamese turned out as it did. By every tangible measure--spending, manpower, high-technology weaponry, logistical support-- the United States and its allies had the decided advantage. The North Vietnamese troops endured the most concen- trated firepower ever directed against an army for seven years. As Henderson suggests, the reason the United States could not subdue its enemy militarily was that enemy military units were far more cohesive than their American counterparts. Facing an opposing force over- whelmingly superior in every obvious dimension, the North Vietnamese units made up for the deficit in superior "unit-for-unit" combat effectiveness built upon high degrees of unit cohesion. (Ranked in terms of unit cohe- sion, the North Vietnamese come first, the Israelis second, the Soviets third, and the Americans a distant fourth.) In several key respects, "the mood music" of Hender- son's analysis is strikingly similar to that in Chubb's work on schools and my work on prisons. He does not claim that managing military units in ways that foster cohesion can transform any outgunned, outmanned force into a win- ning army; nor does he claim that unit cohesion guarantees combat effectiveness, relative or absolute. He does, how- ever, suggest that military organization at the battlefield unit level has a significant bearing on combat effective- ness. Such things as grand strategy, upper-level organiza- tion, weapons and materials, the number of soldiers, and technology matter, but so do the management factors relat- ed to unit cohesion.27 Conclusion Although this exploratory article focuses on schools, prisons, and armies, the effort to recover the public man- agement variable should extend to public organizations of every kind--police departments, mental institutions, wel- fare agencies, public hospitals, regulatory agencies, and so on. Even legislatures, defined conventionally as bodies that make rather than implement public laws, probably can and should be studied in this way.28 To relate management to outcomes and process to per- formance is no easy task. Any serious effort to analyze the conditions under which public management matters to the actual quality of citizens' lives will be fraught with methodological, practical, and moral shortcomings. But unless the future of public management studies involves a deep and abiding concern with what ends particular public organizations ought to achieve and how to manage these organizations accordingly, the field will crumble (dare one say "continue to crumble") into academic irrelevance. To try to recover the public management variable is to do for policy makers, public managers, and concerned citi- zens what these groups have not the time, nor often the wits, to do; namely, to search systematically (if not always "scientifically") for ways to realize public goals by the most appropriate administrative arrangements possible. As noted earlier, public organizations are the "hands and</page><page sequence="6">132 PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW feet" of important public purposes. If public management studies have a worthwhile future--and that is not at all cer- tain--it is as the intellectually independent, public-spirited, and truth-seeking "brains" of the enterprise known as pub- lic management. Successful efforts to recover the public management variable hollow Oxenstierna's famous lament, "If only you knew, my son, with what little wis- dom the world is governed." John J.

Also see Eric Nordlinger, On the Autonomy of the Democratic State (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Uni- versity Press, 1981). In his symposium essay and in his book, Nordlinger is clear that "the state" refers to public officials, individ- ually and collectively. He thereby avoids the anthropomorphic and reification fallacies that plagued earlier generations of "statists." Setting himself at odds with "pluralists," he emphasizes the degree to which public officials act contrary to societal preferences and pressures. The truly interesting and as yet unanswered empirical questions, however, concern the conditions under which each paradigm holds, and the reasons for variations in state "autonomy" across policy areas, organizational contexts, and time. 4.

Hundreds of studies have been published of the language, leaders, laws, rites, and rituals of prisoners. There are fascinating mono- graphs about the effects on people of the prison ethos and of being imprisoned, about the consequences (or lack thereof) of rehabilita- tive programs, about inmate argot and roles, and about the informal distribution of authority that develops in prison settings. 12.

Contrary to much of the "ineffective prisons" literature, Useem's carefully documented work provides no support for the theory that security-driven management and prison violence vary inversely. The idea that the more prison authorities do to control inmates, the more inmates will run out of control is intriguing, counterintuitive, and wholly without empirical evidence to support it.

To pluck the beam from my own eye, it relies too heavily on partic- ipant observation and not enough on quantitative methods. There are more precise and systematic ways of investigating the relation- ship (if any) between prison management practices and levels of order, amenity, and service. Also, while Chubb and Moe may be guilty of overgeneralizing about the superiority of "team manage- ment" in schools, in Governing Prisons, I am guilty of failing to stress adequately that paramilitary, bureaucratic management may be counterproductive in low-custody settings; crying "exploratory research" and offering a few footnotes to that effect are not enough to make this crucial point stick. Finally, while I and the other "well-governed prisons" authors take some pains to defend the nor- mative presumptions in our arguments, we have not gone nearly far enough: order, amenity, and service are not reading, writing, and arithmetic; the empirical and the normative relationship of these goals to the "ultimate aims" of imprisonment (punishment, deter- rence, incapacitation, rehabilitation--pick your favorite combina- tion) needs to be clarified. 19.

Huck, you will recall, acted to oppose slavery not because he knew (or cared) much about its moral standing as a matter of principle; indeed, he reckoned that slavery was probably right. But Huck loved Old Jim, and so he risked life, limb, and hellfire to help Old Jim escape. 21. Some analysts, however, argue that little has been done to achieve military unit cohesion. See William Darryl Henderson, Cohesion: The Human Element in Combat (Washington: National Defense Press, 1985), especially pp. 156-160. 22. That is not to say that the supposed training/primary relationships/battlefield performance nexus does not exist; it is merely to say that it has not been documented except by circum- stantial evidence, anecdotes, and "war stories." 23. For example, see Arthur T. Hadley's The Straw Giant: Triumph and Failure of America's Armed Forces (New York: Random House, 1986). 24. One reason for this lack of study is the historic inattention of public administration scholars to questions of national security and mili- tary organization. See the essays by Frank L. Trager, Chris L. Jef- fries, Lawrence J. Korb, Albert G. Dancy, and Barry H. Steiner in "Symposium on National Security and Public Administration," Public Administration Review, vol. 37 (July/August 1977), pp. 319- 367. One excellent statement on defense organization is Samuel P. Huntington, "Defense Organization and Military Strategy," The Public Interest, vol. 75 (Spring 1984), pp. 2046. 25. Richard Halloran, "Air Force and Marines Battle 'Ticket-Punch- ers,"' New York Times (April 25, 1988), p. A18. 26. William Darryl Henderson, Cohesion: The Human Element in Combat. An Army colonel with a doctorate in international poli- tics, Henderson commanded a rifle company in Vietnam in 1966- 1967 and was wounded seriously in an attack by North Vietnamese in the demilitarized zone in 1975. In Cohesion, he draws creatively on both his academic and his military experiences. 27. The most serious ongoing challenge to this view comes from those who argue that, in modern warfare, technology dwarfs the "human element." For example, see Steven M. Shaker and Alan R. Wise, War Without Men: Robots on the Future Battlefield (Elmsford, NY: Pergamon-Brassey, 1988). 28. For example, how is it that the same House of Representatives that produces an arguably sound package of tax reform measures also produces an obviously flawed series of pork-barrel bills? To what, if any, extent can such variations in the quality of national legisla- tion be explained by intra-House differences in organization? For an answer grounded creatively and intelligently in work by public choice theorists, see R. Douglas Arnold, The Logic of Congression- al Action, forthcoming.
