A STUDY of Jewish mysticism along critical and scientific lines, as may be expected, dates from the nineteenth century. It is sufficient to mention the works of Franck, La Kabbale, 1843; Joel, Die Religions- philosophie des Sohar, 1849; Landauer, posthumous articles in Littera- turblatt des Orients, 1845 ; Jellinek, Beitrdge zur Geschichte der Kabbala, 1852; Stern, "Versuch einer umsta*ndlichen Analyse des Sohar," in Ben-Chananja, 1858-60; Gratz, principally notes 3 and 12 in the sev- enth volume of his Geschichte derjruden, I873. The net result of those investigations was a more or less clear presentation of the "zoharitic system " and the fastening of the authorship of the Zohar, the Bible of Kabbalism, upon Moses de Leon, who lived in the second half of the thirteenth century. It was furthermore the merit of Gratz to give emphasis to Landauer's important discrimination between the Kab- balah proper and the older mysticism of gaonaic times. Jellinek was well on the road toward giving a synthetic, truly historical view of the rise of the Kabbalah out of the mysticism that preceded it. To pre- sent this view in full is the aim of Karppe's work. The author has used to good purpose the Vorarbeiten mentioned above. He might also have referred in the chapter dealing with gaonaic mysticism to Zunz, Die gottesdienstlichen Vortrdige der Juden (chap. 9, "Geheim- lehre"), 1832 (second edition, 1892), and in that portion of his book in which he compares Philo and the Zohar (especially with regard to the allegorical method of interpretation) to Siegfried's Philo von Alex- andria, 18 7 5. Jewish mysticism is older than the canon. It is found imbedded in its third section. Its origins may be sought in that vast store of mythology that came to Palestine from Babylon. Persia contributed its share. A fresh impetus came from Greece. It meant a reaction against Jewish orthodoxy with the Law as the canon par excellence and</page><page sequence="2">RECENT THEOLOGICAL LITERATURE 335 its disdain for speculation. For Jewish mysticism, we believe Karppe is right, is essentially speculative. "Thou hast no business with secret things "-such was the motto of official Judaism. But speculation could not be driven back. Parasitically it wound itself about the Law and the prophets. The first chapter of Genesis (the minimum of speculation that the Law made room for) was made the substratum of physical, and the first chapter of Ezekiel that of metaphysical, specula- tions. The method of interpretation was naturally allegorical. The Mishna had to reckon with those speculations which had enticed some of its best men. They speculated on "what is above and what is below, what was before and what shall be in the end." In gaonaic times mysticism became grossly anthropomorphic. It received a philosophi- cal turn under the hands of the master-minds of Jewish theology: Saadya, Ibn Gabirol, Maimonides. Ibn Ezra contributed his specula- tions on numbers. The "sefiroth" are met with in the gaonaic "Book of Creation." But neither the casuistry of talmudism nor the rationalism of the philosophers offered sufficient consolation to the victims of the crusades. The mystics of the thirteenth century gave themselves over to metaphysical speculations of an exceedingly abstract and abstruse char- acter. The essential doctrine of the Kabbalah (as Jewish mysticism now called itself) is that of the " sefiroth," which are the divine attri- butes hypostasized, intermediaries between the finite world of matter and the infinite Deity. One readily perceives in the Kabbalah ele- ments akin to the Philonian philosophy on the one hand and to the Gnosis on the other. In the Zohar we have a precipitate of all pre- vious movements upon which the peculiar stamp of the Kabbalah proper is imprinted. It takes up a hostile attitude to talmudic Juda- ism. The Mishna is the handmaid that arrogates to herself the posi- tion of right belonging to the mistress, that is, the Kabbalah. Yet the official Judaism of pre-Mendelssohnian times was tinged with kabbal- istic doctrines. Thus the Kabbalah represents a noteworthy side of Judaism. It abounds in absurdities; but it aims high and sees deep. Much unsinniges it has, but also tiefsinniges. The Kabbalah is indeed a Jewish Gnosis. Of the practical or thaumaturgic Kabbalah Karppe does not treat. Karppe's book is written in a delightful style, which one should expect from a book inscribed to the memory of Renan and (James) Darmesteter. It is to be regretted that the Hebrew quotations are disfigured by misprints so as to be at times unreadable.
