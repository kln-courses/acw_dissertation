Chicago: Rand McNally and Company, 1958. 384 pp., appendix, 5 drawings, 2 maps, 61 photographs. $6.95. Reviewed by ROLAND W. FORCE, Chicago Natural History Museum Thor Heyerdahl is no stranger either to American readers or to success. His Kon- Tiki, the account of a voyage on a raft, was a best seller here and abroad. The film of the voyage was widely distributed and is currently being shown on television. Now Aku-Aku, riding on the crest of the earlier book's popularity, will probably set new sales records. The fact that its main thesis-that the Pacific Islands were settled pri- marily from the New World-rruns counter to current scientific thinking is apparently beside the point. Whatever else it is, A ku-Aku is not a scientific book. This in itself is insufficient grounds for criticism. There are many excellent nonscientific books-and regrettably quite a number of poor scientific ones. The lamentable fact about this particular work (a Book-of-the-Month) is that a wide reading audience will probably accept it as con- siderably more than it is. Though it purports to convey scientific facts, it is in fact an adventure story. Unfortunately, the public at large will probably give undeserving credence to its sensationalized contents. To the man on the street, who has had no occasion to read any of the excellent scientific investigations of Easter Island such as those by Thomson, Dixon, Metraux, Shapiro, and Lavachery, the impression conveyed by Aku-Aku will probably be that for more than a century anthropologists have been unperceptively sitting on their hands, while it has remained for Heyerdahl alone to display the insight and peculiar acumen sufficient to fling aside the obfuscating impediments to understanding and to set the record straight once and for all. Easter Island, lonely, isolated, and barren, forms the easternmost apex of the equi- lateral triangle which encompasses the vast area of the Pacific Ocean known as Poly- nesia. The grassy slopes of this volcanic island are studded in some places with giant anthropomorphic stone figures with elongated ear lobes, over-thrusting brows, and prominent noses. Some of these massive sculptures lie toppled over, the rock platforms on which they once stood crumbling away. It is on this tiny dot of land 2,000 miles from South America, and almost as far from its nearest Polynesian neighbor, that most of the adventures recounted in Aku-Aku transpired. Easter Island was named to commemorate its discovery by the Dutchman Rogge- veen on Easter Sunday in 1722. In the years that followed, various explorers and othel voyagers such as whalers and castaways paid occasional visits. As with so many other Pacific island peoples, contact between Easter Islanders and the outside world boded ill for the natives. Uncounted numbers succumbed to communicable diseases for which they had developed no selective immunity. Others were simply shanghaied and died as slave laborers on the guano islands off the coast of Peru. By 1872 the native population had diminished to a mere 111 persons. In 1934 there was only one individual who had witnessed any functioning native culture. She was over 100 years old and her recollec- tions were so poor as to make her of no value as an informant. Thus the society of Easter Island today is so far removed from its precursors that what remains is far from a valid representation of precontact native life. For this [61, 1959]</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 709 reason, much of the content of A ku-Aku suffers from a dearth of substantial and de- pendable fact about the old Easter Island culture. In a brief appendix Heyerdahl alludes to findings of the expedition which support his claim that Polynesia was settled from America-with Easter Island as a stepping stone-previous to later migrations which originated in Southeast Asia and finally arrived only after a devious course via the Japanese Current to the North American continent and thus eventually to the South Seas. A special monograph directed to the scientific audience is promised. Whatever comment there is in Aku-Aku about the expedition's findings, it is without exception in support of Heyerdahl's theory of migra- tion. He finds support for his approach in tracing what he regards as similarities be- tween Peruvian and Easter Island folklore, sun worship, megalithic sculpture, physical characteristics, ear lobe distention, masonry techniques, certain specific plants and a few linguistic terms. As it is presented, the evidence verges on being almost too con- vincing. In this respect it is highly reminiscent of the theories of G. Elliot Smith, who magnified a number of broad cultural similarities and emphasized them out of propor- tion to the existing dissimilarities in "proving" that the essential migrations which settled the farther reaches of the earth stemmed from Egypt. It would be unfair, however, to censure completely the Norwegian Archeological Expedition to Easter Island. No doubt the controlled excavations carried on by the four archeologists who accompanied Heyerdahl will provide valuable information on the prehistory of the island. Actually, a good bit of the Easter Island adventure recounted in Aku-Aku is more speleological than archeological. For excruciatingly frightening experiences it would be difficult to surpass one episode in which the author creeps through an ever-narrowing crevice in the subterranean depths of the island. The weight of the over-burden presses down claustrophobically, the air becomes foul, there is less and less room to move, he loses his way. Finally, after a long and arduous journey, a safe exit is made. As for the other ventures into the family caves, the accounts are as repetitious and melodramatic as they are meretricious. Throughout the book, the attempt to create an aura of mystery, suspense and remarkable discovery is far from subtle. Heyerdahl is nowhere so eloquent as in the last chapter. In a dialogue between himself and his aku-aku, the part of the protagonist is taken by the robustly impetuous "guardian spirit" with Heyerdahl as the devil's advocate. The spirit accuses him of being "prosaic" and "no longer interested in anything but dry facts." The writer replies that he has lived most of his life among scientists and has learned that the first task of science is pure research. "No speculation, no attempt to prove one thing or another." Following on Kon-Tiki, the subsequent American Indians in the Pacific, and 355 previous pages of ardent support of a pet theory, this comment may promote a grimace or two. The title of the book is derived from the Easter Islanders' term for what Heyerdahl translates as a guardian spirit. Every sensible person on Easter Island has one, we are told, and even the author himself procured one-a particularly strong one at that. It was this acquisition apparently which allowed him to be admitted to the secret caves where were stored "curious cave stones"--utterly unique sculptures, the like of which had never before been recovered from the island. The several color plates which illus- trate these sculptures display objects which are so dissimilar to anything contained in previous collections of materials from Easter Island as to suggest extremely late if not contemporary manufacture.</page><page sequence="3">710 A merican Anthropologist [61, 1959] The unorthodox nature of the materials that Heyerdahl recovered from the Easter Island caves is particularly evident when they are compared with an authentic collec- tion of archeological and ethnological materials collected on Easter Island during a quarter of a century in the early 1900's. They are part of the extensive Fuller Collection which has just arrived at Chicago Natural History Museum for exhibit and study. Carvings in both wood and stone, implements, tools, and tapa cloths are among the more outstanding individual pieces. It is possible that because of exposure to the substantial evidence contained in such collections and supplied by the writers of relatively factual if dull and undramatic monographs on Easter Island culture, your reviewer is something less than ardently enthusiastic about this latest "tiki tome." But then again it may simply be that he has no aku-aku of his own to lead the way. ARCHEOLOGY Chichen Itza and Its Cenote of Sacrifice: A Comparative Study of Contemporaneous Maya and Toltec. ALFRED M. TOZZER. (Memoirs of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University, Volumes XI and XII.) Cambridge: Peabody Museum, 1957. viii, 316 pp., appendix, 710 illustrations, 27 tables. n.p. Reviewed by LINTON SATTERTHWAITE, University of Pennsylvania The late Alfred M. Tozzer was a great teacher who first inspired many Meso- americanists of the past and present generation, especially Mayanists. As the mono- graph shows, he kept abreast of their results and of those of others, changing his ideas with new developments, which included very extensive excavations at Chichen Itza. His special interest in this famous site dates from 1904 when he was on the spot watch- ing E. H. Thompson begin to recover the bones of sacrificed victims and the accom- panying offerings, which had been thrown in the cenote or "Sacred Well." There were gold and copper objects as well as jade, and perishables not usually preserved in Maya country. The unique collection came to Peabody Museum, Harvard, where it was in Tozzer's charge. The main title of the present publication applies most specifically to Chapters V and VI, which are expansions and revisions of an original short paper dealing broadly with the cenote, "giving a background of its history and ritual." Chapter VIII was added, dealing with Maya trade, which must account for some of the cenote finds. The cenote collection is described in general terms only. Reports on the bones (Hooton 1940) and on the metal objects (Lothrop 1952) have appeared, while reports dealing with other materials are yet to come. However, a short descriptive statement on textiles, by Joy Mahler, is incorporated. The 16th-century historical sources also have their bearing on Chichen Itza as a great architectural complex. During its later "Mexican" or "Maya-Toltec" periods, it provides a great wealth of sculptural and mural art-contemporary pictures of the people, often in action. Tozzer's interest in this other facet of the site goes back at least to his "Maya and Toltec Figures at Chichen Itza" (1930), and this is the focus of attention in the opening chapters. Chapter I is an excellent background resume of Maya archeology from earliest times. In Chapter II the historical and archeological data are used to produce the au- thor's reconstruction of the "History of Chichen," with frequent references to Chapters III and IV, which may be regarded as appendices covering the archeology as such, and in great detail. Here, of course, comparisons with the Toltec capital at Tula are of</page></plain_text>
