<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROTAGORAS THE HISTORIAN RICHARD A. McNEAL I. THE GREAT SPEECH Herodotus, as Cicero said, was the father of history. But Herodotus' achieve- ment was owing not just to his particular genius but to the time and place in which he lived. His age was ripe for the creation of the historical frame of mind. And yet because Herodotus' work alone has survived the wreck of fifth-century historiography (apart, of course, from Thucydides and scattered fragments of other writers), we are apt to credit him specifically with ideas which were the common property of the age. To say this much is not to denigrate Herodotus, but only to insist that others shared his interests and biases. The sophist Protagoras was one such man. A contemporary and acquaintance of Herodotus, and perhaps even an intimate friend (I would like to believe that two such sympathetic souls shared more than the occasional crater of wine in the house of Pericles), Protagoras in his own way deserves credit for helping to establish the historical outlook among the Greeks. His contribution in this re- gard is now hard to determine because his works have perished almost completely; and his ideas survive, if at all, only in garbled quotations in the work of others. One surviving fragment, however, the Great Speech in Plato's Protagoras, is a priceless document in the early history of historiography. This speech needs to be recognized for what it is - a brave attempt to give a linear and progressive history of human origins. It bears all the expected hallmarks of the age of Herodotus and is consistent with the historical ideas of the Histories. It is ex- actly the kind of historical inquiry to be expected of a man who was a disciple of the Ionian Enlightenment and who had probably talked long and hard with both Anaxagoras and Herodotus. The Great Speech (320c-328d) is Protagoras' long and elaborate reply, a piece of epideictic oratory in fact, to Socrates, who has claimed that virtue, which in good Greek fashion both he and Protagoras understand as political virtue, or citizenship, cannot be taught. The Athenians, says Socrates, call on experts for technical matters, but call upon all citizens in matters pertaining to politics (319a-d). Presumably they do so because they believe that political virtue is a common possession by nature. Everyone has it, and it is therefore not teachable. To illustrate this thesis, Socrates says that fathers cannot hand on political virtue. As is the case with Pericles' sons, who are likened to grazing animals, virtue is a chance discovery dependent on natural disposition (319d-320b).</page><page sequence="2">300 RICHARD A. McNEAL Against this thesis, Protagoras maintains that virtue can indeed be taught. To illustrate his side of the argument, he offers to give a logos or a mythos. In fact he gives both, and each is designed to support his basic point of view. But the two parts of his apology concern different subjects. In the concluding logos (324d-328d), he argues that virtue is taught consciously and continuously by the whole community, and that because natural capacity varies, parents can be different from their children. This whole discussion deals with present behavior - with people whose actions Protagoras can see and describe for himself. His so- cial theory arises from data which he himself can control. But the introductory mythos is altogether different. Rather than being what we would consider a proper argument, it is a parable, the apparent purpose of which is to make a point in a colorful way. The gods created mortal creatures, says Protagoras, and entrusted Prometheus and Epimetheus with the job of equip- ping them for survival in their life on earth. Epimetheus gave some attributes to some animals and others to others. But when he got around to humankind, he had nothing left to give. Prometheus, therefore, to preserve the race, stole the arts of Hephaestus and Athena, together with fire. But these necessities of sur- vival did not include political wisdom, which was in the keeping of Zeus. People did have a share in divinity - raising altars and images of the gods - invented speech, built houses, and engaged in agriculture. But they lived dispersed, not able to create cities. This dispersed way of life left them prey to wild animals, against which their crafts were insufficient protection, and prey to each other, since they did not have the art of government. In fear for the survival of hu- mankind, Zeus sent Hermes to impart reverence (aidos) and justice (dike), so that people might have an ordered civil life. Zeus insisted that these qualities be distributed, not as the arts had been - some to some and others to others - but to all, on the grounds that cities could not exist if only a few shared in justice and reverence. He further laid down the law that anyone having no part in these qualities be put to death as a plague of the state. II. THE PROBLEM OF THE MYTH Before I discuss the implications of this myth, there is a serious problem to be confronted first. Can Plato be used as a source for the sophist? Is the Great Speech, and the myth in particular, a reasonable statement of Protagoras' own doctrine? Or is it a cleverly designed attempt on the part of Plato to subvert Protagoras' ideas by restating them - incorrectly - in terms of Plato's own thoughts? The con- troversy generated over this issue has been considerable.' The consensus seems to be that because Plato was hostile to the sophists, he wanted, presumably, to replace Protagoras' original version with one of his own and to dramatize his own as if it were the original.' This position on the issue is usually held by com- 1. For a general orientation, see M. Untersteiner, The Sophists (Oxford, 1954), 72-73, note 24, and Michael Gargarin, "The Purpose of Plato's Protagoras," Transactions of the American Philo- logical Association 100 (1969), 133-164. 2. Eric Havelock, The Liberal Temper in Greek Politics (New Haven, 1964), 407-408.</page><page sequence="3">PROTAGORAS THE HISTORIAN 301 mitted Platonists, who themselves find sophistic ideas offensive. The other side of the issue, however, has not been well argued. It seems to be enough to claim, without argument, that Plato was too good a historian, regardless of his ideolog- ical passions, to misrepresent Protagoras. Thus Guthrie can claim that since all the world knew what Protagoras had to say, Plato would have been a fool to attribute the wrong ideas to the sophist.3 Burnet insists that in fact Plato is an excellent historical source: "His artistic gift and his power of entering into the thoughts of other men enabled him to describe the view of early philosophers in a sympathetic manner, and he never, except in a playful and ironic way, sought to read unthought-of meanings into the words of his predecessors."4 This sort of statement does not come to grips with the purpose of the dia- logue. Plato had some reason for discussing the sophist's ideas. Either he fa- vored those ideas, or he wanted to establish the superior value of his own.5 But to establish the nature of Plato's prejudice, it is first necessary to do what has not yet been done -namely, to show whether the patterns of thought which ap- pear in the myth are consistent with what we know of the intellectual history of the age of Herodotus. Those who champion the myth as a reliable guide to Protagoras have never shown why it should be especially characteristic of his thought. What I will try to do in this paper is to make just such an argument. Yes, there are some anomalous features of the myth -certain types of "argument" which, at first sight, are not consistent with Protagoras' presumed naturalist and evolu- tionary stance. But these anomalies are not Plato's intrusive attempts to under- mine Protagoras' credibility, nor are they even characteristically Platonic notions at all. Rather they are part and parcel of a whole nexus of thought stretching in part all the way back to Homer and reflecting in part the revolutionary dis- covery of history in the mid-fifth century. What might be called Protagoras' theological naturalism is the key to under- standing the myth and is quite consistent with the main lines of pre-Socratic thought about nature and man's place in nature. III. THE PURPOSE OF THE MYTH If the concluding logos of the Great Speech argues for the value of teaching as the basic source of political virtue (and nobody would disagree here), what is the "argument" of the introductory myth? It too asserts the same point, but it does 3. W. K. C. Guthrie, In the Beginning (Ithaca, 1957), 140. 4. John Burnet, Early Greek Philosophy, 4th ed. (London, 1930), 31. The same confidence is shared by J. S. Morrison, "The Place of Protagoras in Athenian Public Life (460-415 B.C.)," Classical Quarterly 35 (1941), 7. 5. Gargarin is correct to insist on the importance of this question. Gargarin himself says that Plato gives an even-handed and even reverential account of the sophist because he wants to stress the real value of Protagoras' theories of education. 6. For the origin and history of the term "natural theology," see W. Jaeger, The Theology of the Early Greek Philosophers (Oxford, 1948), 1ff. St. Augustine knew that natural theology began with the Milesians, as did Cicero.</page><page sequence="4">302 RICHARD A. McNEAL so on the basis of past history, or rather of prehistory. Protagoras tries to explain the present state of society by analyzing its origins. A settled political life, he says, could have come about only if people had learned not only certain tech- nical skills but also political virtue itself. The myth is in effect a kind of historical thought. But the "history" which it contains is so overlaid by what we are apt to call antihistorical ideas that it is hard to appreciate its true significance. Protagoras is trying desperately to do what we would consider the right thing (at least he asks the right question), but his background prevents him from being altogether successful. Coming as he does at the very start of the Western tradition of historiography, at the time when Herodotus himself is only just establishing, however imperfectly, the canons of historical thought, Protagoras can hardly be faulted for his limited perception of proper historical method. And yet we may rush to convict him for failing to write history as we would write it. Herodotus, if judged by a too rigidly modern standard, will seem to be a mere storyteller, a geographer, an anthropologist, or anything but a respect- able historian. It is surely wrong to expect the very first attempts at history to be narrowly rational explanations of the past, fully free of myth.7 What is im- portant about archaic historiography is the degree to which it strives for a ra- tional understanding of the past, not necessarily its success in attaining that end. What are those aspects of the myth which show the historical consciousness be- ginning to form? That is the real question. Mythic and historical explanations do not necessarily exclude one another in the mid-fifth century. For us to insist, on the basis of hindsight, upon such a distinction is anachronistic. Archaic Greek historical writing is apt to be a wonderful medley of things. Our neat categories, or even those of Plato and Aristotle, may not be relevant. a. Myth as Explanation If Protagoras is trying to write history, why does he engage in myth? Myth is a distinctive way of illuminating logos, or of interpreting the world imaginatively. In effect, the traditional mythic form is being used as the handmaiden of a logos which by this time had grown increasingly independent of mythos.8 The myth is not mere entertainment, and neither Protagoras nor Plato for that matter is in any doubt about the propriety of the myth to the subject matter. There are times when "logical" argument fails and only "mythical" argument will do. Plato was not the first to understand this point.9 The myth is therefore a metaphor 7. This point is well made by Frangois Lasserre, "Herodote et Protagoras: le debat sur les constitu- tions," Museum Helveticum 33 (1976), 83. But Lasserre is unnecessarily hesitant about the value of Protagoras' myth as a kind of historical explanation. He falls into the trap of assuming that, because Protagoras chooses to adapt the myth of Prometheus to his views on the origin of the polis, the myth is not an historical explanation. 8. Untersteiner, 58-59. 9. C. C. W. Taylor, Plato: Protagoras (Oxford, 1976), 76, is naive to say that Plato condemns Protagoras' resort to myth on the grounds that it is indicative of the sophist's cavalier attitude toward</page><page sequence="5">PROTAGORAS THE HISTORIAN 303 and is full of the traditional imagery. Prometheus and Zeus are great enemies in the mythological tradition as we know it from Hesiod and Aeschylus, and it is within this mythological context that Protagoras meant to work. That Protagoras engaged in myth is a mark of his own technical skill, and not of Plato's. Plato did not invent the myth as a means of "logical" discourse. It may even have been Protagoras himself who initiated a method of argument which Plato later carried to such artistic heights.10 The sophists are known to have taught by parables, and a fair sample of one of Prodicus' own epideictic displays is preserved by Xenophon (Memorabilia 2.1.21-33): the Choice of Her- akles. If Plato could insert into his Phaedrus (230ff.) a speech by Lysias, why not a composition by Protagoras? The myth may have come from a regular trea- tise which Protagoras is supposed to have written: Peri tes en archei katastaseos, noted by Diogenes Laertius (9.55).11 It is interesting that Herodotus speaks of the katastasis of both men and state (2.173; 5.92; 8.83), meaning thereby "human nature" and "constitution," and that he and Sophocles are the earliest extant writers to use this word. However hard he might try to explain man's present by his past, Protagoras is not writing history for the simple reason that he cannot. He may have enough historical sense to ask the question of how humankind appeared, but he has not the foggiest notion how to go about an historical answer to the question. The methods of historical inquiry were so new in his time that there was no body of existing research upon which to base an answer. Protagoras did not have the results of comparative and historical anthropology at his disposal. He was trying to explain what for him was unexplainable. Knowing nothing about the prehis- tory of humankind, he made a brave attempt to guess what must have happened.12 Unable to give a "logical" answer to his question about the origin of social life, he indulges in a creative act of imagination. b. Myth as Camouflage Whether or not Protagoras' treatise contained the myth in some form, Plato's repeated emphasis on its epideictic character must force us to believe that it formed part of the sophist's public bag of tricks -that he used it to mesmerize his au- the truth and toward rigor in argument. If Plato can use myth seriously (and he is at his most serious when he resorts to allegory, or parable), surely Protagoras should be accorded the same respect. Plato's use of myth was not some special innovation on his part in cases where logical argument might do as well, but a resort to the traditional craft of the Greek poet. 10. J. Adam and A. M. Adam, Plato: Protagoras (Cambridge, 1893), xix, in which see prior bibli- ography. 11. W. K. C. Guthrie, The Sophists (Cambridge, 1971), 64, note 1, discusses the question whether Protagoras' apology is based on an actual work of his. 12. T. A. Sinclair, "Protagoras and Others: Socrates and His Opponents," in Sophistik, ed. C. J. Classen (Darmstadt, 1976), 82-83. Cf. also Louis Boudin, Lire le Protagoras (Paris, 1975), 86: the myth is a cloak for the proclamation of a law which Protagoras judges necessary for the existence of human society. Guthrie, In the Beginning, 84, assumes, wrongly, that Protagoras' gods are mere metaphorical adornment and are not to be taken seriously.</page><page sequence="6">304 RICHARD A. McNEAL dience, just as he all but mesmerized Socrates. We would not be far wrong to see the myth as a part at least of Protagoras' standard public lecture.'3 But given the epideictic character of the myth, why should Protagoras resort to such a device? It may be a kind of explanation; but as a resort to metaphor, it seems to confuse matters. Speaking at the same time as an advanced social theorist and as an orthodox pagan, Protagoras seems to invite obscurity. The answer to this problem may be found in Protagoras' own statements in the dialogue. Acutely aware of the dangers of the sophist's life, he says that he freely admits his educational purpose rather than conceal it and so arouse suspi- cion, and that he has adopted other precautions as well (317/b). These he does not specify. If we are to judge from the accusations directed against not only him but against many other friends of Pericles, the intellectual life, even in Athens, was a hazardous business, especially for foreigners, who did not have the protec- tion of citizenship.'4 To survive in this atmosphere of ill-will, Protagoras took pains not to insult his hosts, and not to ridicule what he might have considered the current fictions. Whatever he thought about the gods, he knew better than to deny their existence outright, especially in an epideictic show piece. Plato even accuses the sophists of going out of their way to flatter Athenian democratic opinion, of trying to court popularity. However heinous a crime in Platonic circles, this courting of popularity made perfect sense to Protagoras, who insisted, after all, on the va- lidity of received opinion. He developed the epideictic myth for the express pur- pose of protecting himself and allaying public suspicion of his doctrines, which were in fact apt to be subversive. The myth may therefore function as just the sort of "cover" which he says that he will not use (316c). Its purpose is to flatter the various segments of his audience. If some citizens are not virtuous in the old noble sense of descent from the gods, they are so because of their possession of certain skills which they have learned. This ingenious flattery of everyone would of course attract good will and paying students. '5 IV. HISTORY AS PROGRESSIVE EVOLUTION Greek historiography grew up in a very special set of circumstances and lasted, as a going concern, for barely two generations. It was sparked by the Persian Wars, which gave the Greeks a sense of their own special destiny and of their 13. W. Nestle, Von Mythos zum Logos (Stuttgart, 1940), 282, comes to this conclusion. 14. For a survey of the evidence against the members of Pericles' circle, see H. Derenne, Lesproces d'impijtj intents aux philosophes de Vtme et au IVeme siecles (Liege, 1939). 15. A. W. H.

Kerferd, The Sophistic Movement (Cambridge, Eng., 1981), 22, assumes that merely having Pericles' support was enough to give Protagoras protection. Historically, such protection did not amount to much for a great many people. Protagoras certainly knew that he had to look out for himself. And even he failed in the end and was forced out of town, dying, so the legend goes, in a shipwreck as he fled Athenian malice. The persecution of the brighter intellects, even Athenian citizens, is a sad commentary on the Athenian's intolerance for new ideas in the fifth century.</page><page sequence="7">PROTAGORAS THE HISTORIAN 305 ability to do great things in the world. Entranced by their newfound strength, the Greeks could at last free themselves from the old Hesiodic notion of a past Golden Age and of a present which was only a degeneration from past glories. Aided no doubt by Ionian thinking about the origin of the material world, they could conceive of their own time and their own society as an improvement over the past, with a prospect of even greater improvement in the future. Man's own achievements and his society, which was the collective expression of those achieve- ments, were fit objects of inquiry. Herodotus' generation was the first to give ex- pression to this idea, to create historical thinking. But the whole endeavor de- pended on an implicit faith in peoples' ability to control circumstances. It needed a buoyant optimism, and this optimism utterly failed in the course of the Peloponnesian War. Thucydides might write history of a sort; but his work is filled with antihistorical tendencies, and after him serious inquiry into the human past turned into philosophical channels. But while the euphoria lasted, a mind such as Protagoras' could play with the possibilities offered by a progressive theory of human origins.16 a. Definitions of Evolution At this point something must be said about the meaning of "evolution." The modern biologist, following in the footsteps of Darwin, talks about a theory of natural selection which involves local and random adaptation to changing en- vironments. There is no question of a general improvement in the nature or the number of species, no innate progress in nature. Modern scientists at any rate abandon any equation between evolution and progress. They do so because of the inherent anthropocentric bias entailed in such an equation. But the popular mind has long been prone to exactly this confusion. As long ago as the mid-seventeenth century the word "evolution" was used to mean a progressive development, an orderly unfolding from the simple to the complex. Though Darwin used the word in the last sentence of his Origin of Species in 1859, he preferred to describe his work in terms of "descent with modification" precisely because he wanted to avoid the old vernacular overtones of "evolution." But social theorists, working with Darwin's new ideas, proceeded to equate "de- scent with modification" and "evolution." Herbert Spencer, in his First Principles of 1862, was the first to misapply the new evolutionary theory, or, more correctly, to attach the vernacular meaning of evolution to Darwin's idea. The social use of "evolution" thus came to have a meaning which the biological use did not imply. Though Darwin, committed as he was to philosophical materialism, deliber- ately tried to eliminate the notion of a progressive and purposeful evolution, 16. For a large-scale treatment of this hypothesis, see the splendid book by Frangois Chatelet, La Naissance de l'histoire (Paris, 1962). R. Drews, The Greek Accounts of Eastern History (Cam- bridge, Mass. 1973), comes to the somewhat more restricted conclusion that the "Great Event" (that is, the Persian War) finally made the idea of history possible for the Greeks. For the whole subject of revolutionary theory among the Greeks, see Robert Nisbet, Social Change (New York, 1972).</page><page sequence="8">306 RICHARD A. McNEAL contending that apparent order in the world is only the chance result of the indi- viduals of a species following their own advantage, he suffered the fate of having his radically new idea contaminated by long-standing prejudices derived in part from antiquity itself. The Greeks had already established the idea of evolution, but they had done so in a way antithetically opposed to that of Darwin and the modern biologist. They, just as the modern layman, could not conceive an evolutionary process which was not also progressive. It had to go somewhere; it had to have an end. It must also be anthropocentric, and humankind must be at least the current culmination of the process. There was no question but that human culture was higher than the life of animals. And if the course of evolution is progressive, it must be guided to its end by a mind, or a god. The perfection of creation in the natural world illustrates Mind's benevolence and grand design. Mind, in other words, informs the evolutionary process. The result is a natural theology. It is within the context of a natural theology that we will have to discuss Pro- tagoras' evolutionary ideas, and not in terms of the modern biological theory of evolution. b. Law as Discovery Who it was who first applied evolutionary ideas to human culture we cannot be sure. Perhaps Anaximander suggested something of the sort.17 The first in- controvertible evidence that the idea was at least abroad is a fragment of Xenophanes (DK B18): "The gods have not revealed all things to men from the beginning, but by seeking they find in time what is better." The forms of social life change through time, and they change for the better. Implicit in this one frag- ment is the whole notion of a progressive evolution and a firm rejection of Hesiod's pessimism about a fall from grace. Law and custom are man's own discoveries. Protagoras expressly formulates the same notion when he says (326d) that the city forces its young to learn the laws, which were the invention of the lawgivers of old. Further evidence of our own view of societal evolution rests in Protagoras' carefully articulated theory of a two-stage development of humankind. He does postulate, however nebulously, a sequence of events in a linear progression from simple to more complex, or higher. The process is one by which primitive groupings developed into the polis because of necessity.18 17. Anaximander, at any rate, had something to say about human biology. Since the higher animals could not represent the original type of animal, he saw in fish the precursors of humans. Protagoras' notion of the kinship of people and animals had a long prior history. Cf. Burnet, 77. 18. D. Loenen, Protagoras and the Greek Community (Amsterdam, 1941[?]), 106-107. Loenen prefers not to make too much of the "sequence of events" as outlined in the myth because we are dealing with a story. But the progression of events in humanity's climb from animal status to the glories of the polis is precisely the important issue. The whole line of development is historical. Un- tersteiner, 61, is wrong to posit some "state of nature" before Zeus and, after him, an historical epoch in which civilization advances through the mastery of the art of politics. Protagoras thinks that the</page><page sequence="9">PROTAGORAS THE HISTORIAN 307 The outward form of the myth is another sign of its historical character. Typ- ical of Greek historical writing, perhaps because it grew out of epic, is a division between narrative and speeches. The former is reserved for a recital of events; the latter is used to explain and analyze the historian's thinking about cause. Thucydides is the best example of this dichotomous use of narrative and speech. But the practice appears all through Herodotus' work as well, and Protagoras' myth shows the same phenomenon in embryonic form. Epimetheus' four-word request (320d) prepares the way for Prometheus' dismay and consequent effort to repair Epimetheus' shortcomings. And Zeus and Hermes engage in a regular dialogue to decide precisely how Hermes will distribute reverence and justice. In both cases direct discourse is used at a key point in the story to explain the motivations of the actors. This explanation is the historian's own rumination on underlying cause. V. THE CHARACTER OF ANTIHISTORY Much of the difficulty with this attempt at a linear history of human origins is that it is contaminated by a number of ideas which are not a part of the modern evolutionary approach to culture, to say nothing of biology. There is in fact much that is downright antihistorical in the myth. Every historian will work somewhere on the gamut which runs from an em- phasis on the particular and the atypical to an insistence on the generic, or the search for eternal truths. Greek historical writing, even in the hands of Herodotus, who delighted in the unique and the individual, tended to insist on the generic and the eternal truth. To explain the human past by natural law was always the goal, even if this goal was unstated. Protagoras too seems to be more concerned with humankind sub specie aeternitatis than he is with the great deeds of specific individuals. His reconstruction of prehistory therefore comes closer to sociology or philosophy than it does to history. Closely associated with this problem is yet another. The myth is clearly not an empirical examination of evidence in the search for truth because Protagoras has no evidence. He does not even compare various accounts of the story of Prometheus with a view to finding out what common thread lies behind them. Instead of doing what every historian is supposed to do, he gives us what can only be described as a mystical or religious experience. Greek historiography, triggered by the Greeks' fascination with their earthly success in the mid-fifth century, grew out of an essentially ahistorical attitude, flourished with difficulty for a time, and retreated again before the powerful on- slaught of the likes of Plato and Aristotle. Protagoras shows us how the histor- ical habit of mind struggled, not altogether successfully, to free itself from the antihistorical thought which was far more congenial to the Greeks. first stage is civilized too, if on a more primitive level. L. Edelstein, Idea of Progress in Classical Antiquity (Baltimore, 1967), 23, correctly points out that it was the sophists who made an advance over Xenophanes by positing stages of development. But the sophists may be dependent on Empedocles.</page><page sequence="10">308 RICHARD A. McNEAL a. Human Nature Perhaps one of the most troublesome of Protagoras' antihistorical ideas is his insistence on the establishment of a genus humanum, a permanent entity (an ideal type) marked by characteristic kinds of behavior. It is not now fashionable to talk about humanity's special place in nature. Humans are presumed to be in no way unique. They are merely other animals whose genes determine their appearance and behavior. But this notion of a rigid biological determinism, whatever may be its value for the sociologists in contemporary discussions of human nature, must be firmly laid aside if we are going to understand Protagoras. It was in fact Protagoras who was one of the key figures in the creation of the idea of a specific human nature. The definition of humankind is an unquestioned article of faith for Protagoras; and the eternal human type is made to take its proper place in a cosmos whose progressive development is quite literally in the hands of divinity. When Protagoras talks about human nature, he must be un- derstood to talk in terms which modern historians and anthropologists will find very strange. Protagoras' resort to the divine in his definition of humanity involves the de- velopment in two stages already discussed. Partial to that characteristic Greek insistence on binary logic, Protagoras makes an initial separation between the gods, who presumably live forever when once born, and the mortal races. The second term of this antithesis is again divided into two parts: dumb beasts (321b), or the "other" living things, and humankind. Apart from sharing a common origin in the very elements out of which they are molded, people and animals are mortal; and people, just as the various kinds of animals, are endowed by the craftsmen gods with certain special resources, or powers, or capacities. These resources are in part morphological (though the special shape of humans is nowhere described) and in part behavioral. Protagoras mixes precisely what modern taxonomy would keep separate. In order to be "equipped," or "fitted out," man is endowed with three things: logos, technological wisdom, and fire. Strangely, none of these en- dowments is morphological. Humans are not humans because they have an op- posable thumb and walk upright on two legs. It is not how they appear that matters, but how they behave. Logos is not physiological - mere vocal apparatus. It is the capacity for speech and, most importantly, reason. Technological wisdom, logos, and the use of fire constitute a special pattern of behavior in humankind. And this behavior is not the result of a seemingly unique human shape. Pro- tagoras seems to have very little to say about the physical shape of humankind. The idea of behavior as an indication of the nature of a thing is a perfectly good mid-fifth-century notion; and it permeates Herodotus, who has little to say about merely physical differences in human groups. His description of the Nile and of the Egyptians in Book 2 is probably the best example of this ten- dency. The people behave differently, as does the River, which is itself almost personified, because the environment in Egypt is very peculiar by Greek standards. This inclination to ignore morphology in giving people an exceptional place in nature and separating them from animals means that for Protagoras it is man's</page><page sequence="11">PROTAGORAS THE HISTORIAN 309 function that counts. Humans are human because they do particular things. They are those living animals which are capable of logos and creative skill. These are the special functions of humankind. All Western philosophy from the Greeks to Kant and Hegel insisted that man was an animal - but a rational animal. And it was precisely this element of reason, the capacity for syntactical speech and conceptual thought, which made people radically different in kind from other animals. In other words, so far from positing only a difference of degree between men and other animals, traditional philos- ophy insists on breaking the phylogenetic continuity of nature and proclaiming the special status of humankind. Protagoras was one of the founders of this con- tradictory treatment of humanity. He claimed that logos was a power present only in people - a unique characteristic which determines human behavior. Protagoras seems also to believe, as Aristotle would do after him, that nature is not a continuum of degrees but a genuine hierarchy of different kinds. The gods are not just qualitatively different from people; they are above humans, just as humans are above the brute beasts. There is, thus, a hierarchy of grades. The Greek naturalists did not like to muddy their neat schemes by supposing an unin- terrupted continuum, the different degrees of which were only incrementally and therefore superficially different. 19 b. Directing Mind and the Divine Share Also inherent in the traditional philosophical view of humankind is the assump- tion of some immaterial factor which makes people radically distinct from other living things. Indeed, their power of speech and reason is to be traced to just this cause. Here, too, Protagoras helped to formulate the traditional position. Not for him is any explanation based on purely neurological or mechanical con- ditions. He would have agreed wholeheartedly with Descartes's assumption of a "ghost in the machine." Human nature as Protagoras defines it is no chance development. It did not simply happen. Rather it was made to happen for a specific reason. It plays a part in a grand design. It is, in short, a matter of teleology -of the working of Mind. The various capacities are distributed by Epimetheus and Prometheus for a conscious purpose, for the preservation of all species and therefore of the cosmos. The loss of any one species will upset the equilibrium of the whole, which presumably includes the pre-existing gods. The safety of the species is the end at which nature aims (321a).20 As a consequence of this design, humanity is an integral part of the cosmos, not a creation with a unique purpose, or with no purpose at all. Though separate from other animals, people are still an integral part of the world. Their strength, and the source of their cultural progress, comes from nature itself. 19. For a prolix but careful assessment of the ways in which humankind has been, and may be, defined, see Mortimer J. Adler, The Difference of Man and the Difference It Makes (New York, 1967). 20. Loenen, 285.</page><page sequence="12">310 RICHARD A. McNEAL Given this method of creation, how does humanity obtain its "divine share" (322a)? Protagoras seems to make a distinction between mind and matter. The craftsmen gods are divine, but the primal elements on which they work may not be. Thus the primal elements are not themselves endowed with Mind. It is not a case of these elements being self-moved or generating the mortal races out of themselves spontaneously. And not all living beings are credited with a divine share -only people. So the matter on which the gods work is not the means by which humans share in divinity. People must share in divinity by virtue of their special capacities. The capaci- ties, whether of shape or behavior, assigned to the brute beasts do not make them in any sense divine. But Prometheus steals for man just those arts which are divine - the skills of Hephaestus and Athena, together with fire. By participating in these arts, by copying divine behavior, humans get a share in divinity.21 But what of logos? That too is a capacity, or resource, which presumably comes from the gods as a gift. But is it a type of behavior which the gods themselves share? Protagoras does not say.22 Dare we conclude that they must have had it, just as they must have had every other capacity which they apportioned among the animals? Since the Greeks found it impossible to conceive of creation out of nothing, the gods must have had at their disposal every conceivable resource.23 In any case the available resources are finite, as we learn when Epimetheus comes to equip people and has nothing left to use. Protagoras cannot of course account for the ultimate origin of these resources. How did the gods get them? Who can say? Even the question of how people got them can only be answered imaginatively. But these cultural arts, these types of behavior, help to ensure human survival. Somehow they must have become a part of fundamental human nature. Once invented, in whatever way they were invented, they were transmitted from one generation to the next by teaching. This is the basic argument of the first stage of the myth. c. The Meaning of Political Virtue But human nature does not yet have all it needs. Though capable of basic skills and a primitive form of social organization, it needs the addition of an ethical sense, or of political virtue, to make it complete. How did people become polit- ical animals and so separate themselves even further from the other animals?24 21. Gregory Vlastos, "Protagoras," in Classen, 273-274. 22. Guthrie, In the Beginning, 88-89, and Nestle, 282, both assume, rather too readily, I think, that humanity has logos as its divine share. 23. Throughout this discussion of the divine share, I have assumed that this feature of the myth is not an intrusive Platonic idea, but an integral part of Protagoras' own teleological view of human evolution. For this reason I see no point in removing from the text either or both the following phrases: theia moira and syggeneia ton theon. C. W. Muller, "Protagoras uber die Gotter," in Classen, 314, gives a bibliography relevant to the question of deleting the offending words from the text. 24. Was Protagoras the first to coin this famous Aristotelian phrase? Cf. Loenen, 106. Loenen's book is especially valuable because it traces a whole range of ideas backwards from Aristotle through Plato to their presumed origin in Protagoras.</page><page sequence="13">PROTAGORAS THE HISTORIAN 311 Again Protagoras cannot give what we would consider a satisfactory, logical answer to these questions. He simply lacks the necessary historical and anthropo- logical sources. He must rely upon imagination. People acquired, somehow, an ethical sense because, without it, the existence of civil society as Protagoras knew it would be impossible. The resort to Zeus does not explain how the qualities necessary for the preservation of humanity actually came into man's possession. In effect it merely eliminates the problem by assuming that justice exists among people because it must.25 What is the significance of Zeus' intervention? Is political virtue to be consid- ered a part of essential human nature? Does Zeus intervene to alter that nature by correcting the mistakes of Epimetheus and Prometheus? In nonmythical terms, Protagoras seems to say that there comes a time when people learn through experience that reverence and justice are necessary. The survival of the group depends on everyone having these qualities. But of course not everyone need have them to the same degree. Hence Protagoras can claim that, though in every city it is necessary that all men share reverence and justice, there must be a law that anyone incapable of possessing his share must be killed as a threat to society. If everyone possessed these qualties equally, there would be no need for the law. But Protagoras is not so foolish as to believe that everyone will see the benefits of civil society. Zeus' gift seems to be the human product of time, experience, and necessity. If a society learns virtue, that society survives. In this sense virtue is not innate, but universal.26 But how can something be universal and yet not innate? Does Protagoras be- lieve that political virtue is, somehow, by nature?27 Does this fundamental ten- dency toward reverence and justice which is common in some degree to all imply a universal ethical value - in fact an aspect of human nature? Is Protagoras saying that there is some absolute ethical standard, at least insofar as law or custom in any particular case will be an expression of nature?28 Protagoras seems to be a little less sure about the status of virtue than he is about the technical skills. He seems to say that humankind has only a tenuous hold on virtue, that it is a kind of potential which may be realized to a greater or lesser extent but is always in danger of disappearing for lack of cultivation. As perhaps the supreme example of a type of behavior which separates people from the animals, it is a fragile possession at best. And Protagoras does not mean 25. Bodin, 36. 26. Guthrie, The Sophists, 66, and In the Beginning, 90-91. Lasserre, 76, is representative of many who insist that political virtue was distributed equally to everyone. 27. Opinions are of course divided. T. Cole, "The Relativism of Protagoras," Yale Classical Studies 22 (1972), 32, says that political virtue is not an essential part of human nature. But Cole mistakenly says that Protagoras is not interested in establishing the idea of a specific human nature. G. B. Ker- ferd, "Protagoras' Doctrine of Justice and Virtue in the 'Protagoras' of Plato," Journal of Hellenic Studies 73 (1953), 42-45, wants to take the myth literally, saying that people could not form societies because they did not have political virtue, which they could learn only through society. Hence divine intervention was needed to start the process. That is, human nature had to be changed. 28. This is the conclusion of A. Levi, "The Ethical and Social Thought of Protagoras," Mind N.S. 44 (1940), 294-295.</page><page sequence="14">312 RICHARD A. McNEAL by this potential any particular kind of political virtue. He is not talking about some standard of behavior which is valid for all people in all places; he is not identifying virtue with some one social tradition, with any existing law. In this sense, at any rate, he is not positing a universal aspect of human nature in the terms in which we usually think of that term. His "universal" is an empty poten- tial with no particular content. If one means by an ethical sense no more than this, then perhaps one can legiti- mately say that reverence and justice are a part of human nature. But most social theorists would insist on some particular content. Protagoras, however, is too much of a relativist for this. As with the urge for language and for religion, the urge to form a state is common to all people; but the precise way in which this urge may appear will differ. All Protagoras means to say is that without some laws, human political society is impossible.29 Whatever the origin of political virtue, Protagoras' assumption that it grew up as the second stage in human progress and made possible a distinct advance was to have a long life. The polis originated because of peoples' need to protect themselves against wild animals and against each other, because, that is, of the individual's lack of self-sufficiency. Plato thought precisely the same (Politicus 274b; Laws 680e). A rudimentary social life originated when people first appeared, but it could become a true political life - a good life - only in time. Did Plato get his notion of the two cities of his Republic, the City of the Pigs and the Cal- lipolis, from Protagoras' mythic social picture of Prometheus and Zeus? And was it for the same reason that Aristotle could speak of the polis as originating "for the sake of living," but as existing "for the sake of living well"?30 d. Zeus the Lawgiver Seemingly inconsistent with the notion of man as discoverer of his own law and custom through the course of time is Protagoras' treatment of Zeus as a lawgiver (322d-e). It is the god who not only endows people with an ethical sense but who sets down the fundamental law that society must exclude by death anyone who proves incapable of reverence and justice. This equation may disturb us, but it never bothered the Greeks, who assumed that man-made laws were also gifts of the gods. They did not see the contradic- tion, and Protagoras does no more than voice this age-old belief.3' He may want to stress the new and unusual idea that man makes his own laws, but he does so in a way designed, perhaps deliberately, not to offend his audience. His seeming inconsistency has its roots in the relationship between priesthood and society in Greece. No group of priests ever proclaimed a set of laws having eternal validity. The different poleis of Greece were so various and the Greeks had such wide contact with outsiders that mutability had to be accepted. It was 29. Nestle, 286-287. 30. Loenen, 56ff. 31. Ibid., 86ff. Loenen cites a number of relevant ancient sources.</page><page sequence="15">PROTAGORAS THE HISTORIAN 313 always possible to change the laws to fit new circumstances and a new consensus. Thus the gods were called on not to create, but only to sanction. The Greeks had no trouble believing not only that laws and morals were representative of a divine and natural order, but that that order could change. A diversity of laws by nature was quite acceptable. That the god Zeus should intervene providentially in human history is seen by many as further proof that Protagoras' myth is really Plato's. But Protagoras' divine providence is paralleled exactly in a fascinating passage of Herodotus (3.108-109). In this, the only appearance of divine providence in Herodotus, we are told that divinity contrives to preserve the ecological balance between pred- ators and the species on which they prey. Just so Protagoras' Zeus gives humankind virtue to prevent its destruction by the wild animals. Herodotus goes on to talk in some detail about the various "powers" of the several classes of animals which help them maintain their existence. As was tihe case with the handiwork of Epimetheus, some resources go to some and others to others. The striking similarity between Protagoras and Herodotus on this point indicates that Plato was probably correct, or at least not anachronistic, in ascribing to the sophist a doctrine of providential intercession. VI. THE PHILOSOPHICAL BACKGROUND If Protagoras' evolutionary, linear, and historical treatment of human origins is full of what seem to us to be inconsistencies, this situation is no more than should be expected. Protagoras may try to think historically. But not only must he safeguard himself against the prejudice of his audience; he has not the re- sources to write history. The result is a parable whose purpose is to explain how "it must have been." The myth expresses Protagoras' intuitive grasp of the an- swer to his question. But this blend of the historical and the theological is not really strange: it is just what someone of Herodotus' generation should have pro- duced. If seen within the context of previous and contemporary Greek thought, the myth becomes a perfectly reasonable stage in the gradual awakening of the historical consciousness. Protagoras was not the only sophist to concern himself with the origin of hu- mankind. Prodicus, his younger contemporary (born c. 470 or 460 B.C.), wrote both On Nature and The Nature of Man, apparently placing humanity within a cosmos and speculating, as Protagoras did not, on the very origin of existence. The religious aspect of his cosmogony is evident from the parody of it in Aristophanes' Birds (685ff.). But so far from being an innovator,32 Prodicus him- self worked within the confines of a long-standing tradition.33 At least a part of our problem in dealing with fifth-century thought lies at 32. Untersteiner, 210 and 221, note 8. Why does Untersteiner want to claim that Prodicus' reli- gious system is original, or an idea which he first expressed in literature? 33. Morrison, 9-10, recognized the Ionian background of Protagoras' evolutionary account of human society.</page><page sequence="16">314 RICHARD A. McNEAL the door of Aristotle, whose misleading distinctions we insist on following. He wanted to divide an early theologian such as Hesiod, who stated his doctrines in mythical form, from the early philosophers like Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, who proceeded by what seemed to Aristotle to be strict methods of proof (Metaphysics B4, 1000a4 and 18). Aristotle hesitated to call the Ionian naturalists theologians because they appeared to him to have done something quite different from theology, namely to have engaged in true empirical research. But this dichotomy is perfectly false. The theological side of Ionian naturalism is by now well documented,34 and this Ionian tradition was very much alive in mid-fifth-century Athens in the person of Anaxagoras, the ideological successor of Anaximenes, and both the teacher of Pericles and an intimate of the Periclean circle, which included, apart from Athenian citizens, all sorts of peripatetic in- tellectuals like Herodotus and Protagoras. The Athenian sojourns of Protagoras and Anaxagoras can be documented in some detail.35 Wherever else in the Greek world these near contemporaries may have listened to each other, they certainly crossed paths in Athens. Anax- agoras set up shop there sometime after 479, left in 456 or 455 after Thucydides' accusation, returned about 444, and left permanently for Lampsacus about 433, when he was accused by Cleon. Thus he lived in Athens for thirty years, prob- ably not continuously; but he was there from the middle 450s to the middle 440s. Protagoras arrived sometime before Cimon's ostracism in 461 and was banished after 458. He made four other visits: 444, 433, 430, and 422. The last visit oc- curred just before he was accused again and died while trying to escape. Pro- tagoras and Anaxagoras were both in town from 464-458, and again in 444 and 433. Protagoras may have spent the years 458-444 in Sicily, where he earned a great deal of money and reputation. He, together with Herodotus and Empedocles, is supposed to have assisted at the founding of Thurii in 444. It is surely Anaxagoras who is the key figure connecting Protagoras to the Ionian tradition of scientific inquiry; and Protagoras' myth is in many ways a thinly veiled allegory which Anaxagoras himself might have written. What Anaxagoras took by way of inheritance from his Ionian predecessors Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes, and even from Xenophanes, who, though no consistent theologian, scientist, or social theorist himself, helped to popu- larize the more difficult thinkers, can be quickly summarized. In an attempt to understand the process of coming-to-be and passing-away, the Ionians posited an evolutionary genesis in which cosmogony, zoogony, and anthropology were closely combined. In good Hesiodic fashion, they conceived of god inside the universe, an all-creating primitive force which would explain the present state of the world. The primary stuff of nature, whether water, the Boundless, or air, was alive, and divine, and eternal. Because of inherent vortex motion, it was 34. Jaeger, passim. 35. I rely on the excellent article by J. A. Davison, "Protagoras, Democritus, and Anaxagoras," Classical Quarterly N.S. 3 (1953), 33-45.</page><page sequence="17">PROTAGORAS THE HISTORIAN 315 capable of spontaneous generation of our world out of itself.36 The animate and the inanimate, motion and matter, were not yet conceptually separate. Though Ionian science concerned itself with "things aloft" (clouds, rainfall, lightning, and the heavenly bodies), all these, together with the earth, comprised one cosmos. All were considered a part of the world and of the same underlying nature. That is, our earth and its living inhabitants were not yet endowed with a special nature of their own which set them apart from the rest of the cosmos. The heavens, themselves divine, so far from being of a wholly different nature from anything on earth, were the very source of our world, which therefore arose out of the divine and partook of its nature. Despite their attempt to strip away the anthropomorphic guise from divinity, the Milesians contrived to endow their causative stuff with just those qualities which had always marked the Homeric gods. In the epic only a god could be immortal and ageless. Anaximander talks of the Boundless in precisely the same terms. Already in Homer human society is protected by divine providence; and the wisdom of nature, a theme to be developed specially by Parmenides and Her- akleitos, is a direct outgrowth of this epic convention. Try as they might to create "science," the Ionian physicists never moved far from the essentials of Homeric religion.37 They needed no rational proof of gods' existence or activity in the world. Of this they were absolutely certain. In short, pre-Socratic philosophy was, in Jaeger's memorable phrase, a modus deum cognoscendi et colendi.38 Into this evolutionary, monist, and pantheist thought Anaxagoras introduced certain novelties. In place of a single stuff he conceived of particles capable of infinite division without the disappearance of the particles themselves. Through the mixture of these particles occurs the coming-to-be and passing-away of the things of our world. This pluralist conception of the origin of being is augmented by the addition of a mechanism to guide the vortex in a specific direction: namely Nous, an intelligence which directs the process by which the world evolves. This cosmic force is the cause of movement and is of course divine. Since the plan is preconceived, our world exists to fulfill that plan; the process, in other words, is teleological. But mind and matter are still not completely separate because somehow Nous is that thing which is purest and thinnest; and it can occupy space. Anaxagoras wanted a kind of deus ex machine, an external cause, to explain why a body moved itself. But his distinction between mind and matter was only embryonic, and for him the evolution of the universe was a process both me- chanical and spiritual at the same time. Still, his Nous, like Empedocles' Love 36. Cf. Aristophanes' Clouds 828. 37. Nestle, 285, is right to stress the philosophic and religious background of the ideas in Pro- tagoras' myth; but he does not go far enough when he credits these ideas to Herakleitos. The source is rather the whole pre-Socratic tradition and even Homer. It is true that both Xenophanes and Her- akleitos give their first principle supreme wisdom. But the idea of intelligence is at least implicit in Anaximander's Boundless, which governs all things. Xenophanes was first to ascribe conscious- ness to mind, and in this he was followed by Anaxagoras. 38. Jaeger, 174.</page><page sequence="18">316 RICHARD A. McNEAL and Strife, was the beginning of a vital distinction in philosophy; and Anaxagoras appears to have been the first to have been led, by a consciousness of his own reason, to suppose that nature showed the same process on an infinitely grander scale. Since all mind is like to itself, there can be no difference in kind between the divine mind and the human mind. Our mind too is divine; and therefore it is possible for us, because of the similar power we have within us, to apprehend the divine. This foray into the ideas of the Ionian physicists and of Anaxagoras is meant solely to prove the need for a consideration of Protagoras' myth in terms of its fifth-century background. His divine craftsmen are patently the external causa- tive force by which the world in general and people in particular are created. Instead of Nous, Protagoras gives us Prometheus and Epimetheus. Protagoras does not ask about the origin of his dei ex machine, and neither, apparently, did Anaxagoras. People, says Protagoras, are created in conformity with the vi- sion of providence (321a) and later protected by the addition of political virtue for the express purpose of the salvation of the race. The whole scheme is teleo- logical. The one point where Protagoras' myth may not square with Anaxagoras' phi- losophy regards the nature of the primal stuff itself. Is Protagoras a pluralist? He may be so in an Empedoclean sense. At any rate he certainly mentions earth and fire, and then adds, cryptically, "and whatever results from the mixture of fire and earth."39 Is he talking about Empedocles' four roots? If so, he does not attribute divinity to them, whereas Empedocles certainly did so. The diverse stuff which the gods fashion in the myth does not seem to get its divinity from itself. Rather divinity is a quality added later. Hence Protagoras does not attribute di- vine status to the brute beasts, but only to humankind. Anaxagoras is known to have thought that some things had Nous and some did not. Is Protagoras confusing the doctrines of one pluralist with those of another? If he is, his myth, however confused on this point, is at least consistent with perfectly good fifth- century thought. In a discussion of the forerunners and contemporaries of Protagoras, another word needs to be said about Herodotus. I have already pointed out from time to time a few of the instances where the historian and the sophist seem to reflect each other. Scholars have been quick to claim that Herodotus was greatly influenced by the sophists and the pre-Socratics.40 But surely it was just a case of Herodotus listening to Protagoras or Anaxagoras. Such intelligent men must have exchanged views, and there is every reason to think that the sophist for his part took away something of the spirit of the new historical inquiry, that Herodotus 39. Adam, 115, assumes that air and water are indeed meant. 40. See Lasserre, 65, for the influence of the sophists on Herodotus. The relevant bibliography in this article stretches back to Maas' initial broaching of the issue in 1887. Cf. also A. Dihle, "Herodot und die Sophistik," Philologus 106 (1962), 207ff. For the influence of the pre-Socratics on Herodotus, see H. Barth, "Einwirkungen der vorsokratischen Philosophie auf die Herausbildung der histori- ographischen Methoden Herodots," Neue Beitrage zur Geschichte der alten Welt 1 (Berlin, 1964), 173-183.</page><page sequence="19">PROTAGORAS THE HISTORIAN 317 was a part of Protagoras' intellectual background. In any case there is no need to posit definite influence on one side or the other. Certain ideas were in the air in the generation after the Persian War; and whether they appear in Anaxagoras, or Herodotus, or Protagoras, these ideas share a certain similarity: they belong to their time. VII. PROTAGORAS' AGNOSTICISM Can Protagoras, a renowned agnostic (Theatetus 162d), talk about people having a share in the divine? Most readers of the myth say "no" and ascribe its inconsis- tent features to the interfering hand of Plato. If we say that the myth is Pro- tagoras' work, we are left with two alternatives. Either the myth contains a se- rious theology, or Protagoras has merely given a mythical dress to an anthro- pological idea. That is, he assumes that the relationship between men and gods is a projection of the human mind, that, as Xenophanes would say, people create gods in their own image, and that myth is a human way of talking.4" On this assumption the story can be seen as a kind of "cover," the sole purpose of which is to protect Protagoras by camouflaging his views in such a way that they will not offend his listeners. The myth may then be a piece of total hypocrisy, or, if no one wants to see Protagoras as a serious thinker, as a sociological interpre- tation of religion, or as an inquiry into the origin of religious beliefs in human society.42 But this view of the matter, though it goes some way to granting Protagoras a measure of intellect, is anachronistic in two senses. It attributes to Protagoras the total skepticism and atheism of the later sophists. He was, after all, the con- temporary of Herodotus and Sophocles, not of the Critias who wrote the Sisyphus. But even more importantly, we seem to want to make of Protagoras an enlightened Darwinian social theorist who could not possibly take the gods seriously, except as an interesting aberration of human culture. In either case we are in danger of removing Protagoras from his proper historical context. The sophist belongs to an age in which divinity, if not the old anthropomorphic gods, is still taken quite seriously. I have tried to argue that the myth of the Protagoras is a genuine piece of the- ology and that it is also an early example of the historical consciousness at work.43 41. The latter opinion is the opinion of Muller, 315-317, and of Guthrie, The Sophists, 64-65. 42. Kerferd, The Sophistic Movement, 168-169. 43. Morrison, 15, rightly claims that Protagoras' traditional atheism need not have been inconsis- tent with a belief in divine providence: "The history of civilization could be regarded as teleological either in a scientific or religious sense: and the two purposes merge into one another as the philoso- pher identified the purpose of nature with God." Jaeger is absolutely correct to stress the theological side of pre-Socratic thought; but he errs in having too narrow a view of history when he says (p. 180): "There was nothing farther removed from the rationalism of the Sophists than genuine histor- ical thinking. They never realized how little plausibility there was in naively seizing upon the abstract teleological type of argument current in the scientific efforts of their own times and reading it back into the primitive stages of human thought."</page><page sequence="20">318 RICHARD A. McNEAL Such a combination of history and theology is not an impossible chimera, but the very thing which should appear in the period after the Persian War. Secular history did not suddenly emerge full-blown. It had to struggle to free itself from the old religious ways of thought. Both Herodotus and Protagoras show us how severe were the birth pangs. The mythological or religious manner of speaking common to them both may not amount to religion in the sense of gods to whom one sacrifices or makes prayers. But one does not have to supplicate necessity to see it as an immanent force which rules the human life, as a god whose workings explain human history. Northwestern University</page></plain_text>
