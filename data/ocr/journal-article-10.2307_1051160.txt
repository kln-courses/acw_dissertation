<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRADITIONAL BLACKFEET RELIGION AND THE SACRED BADGER-TWO MEDICINE WILDLANDS Jay Hansford C Vest* The U. S. Forest Service has proposed oil and gas development for wildlands adjacent to the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, Glacier National Park, and the Bob Marshall wilderness. In response, tradi- tional Blackfeet tribesmen have argued that these Badger-Two Medicine wildlands are sacred and essential to their traditional reli- gion. In this essay, I document the Blackfeet Tradition and explore the religious significance of these wildlands. Investigating several myths germane to the Badger-Two Medicine wildlands, I conclude that the area is sacred and essential to traditional Blackfeet religion. In cautioning the planners of cities, Plato declared that particular locations possess ecological and spiritual qualities which markedly af- fect human character development.1 This ancient observation con- tains an essential wisdom for contemporary land use planners, as they consider an area in northwestern Montana along the eastern slopes of the continental divide, just southeast of Glacier National Park, an area known as the Badger-Two Medicine. In 1855, these wildlands were retained in reservation status via a treaty between the United States and the Blackfeet Indians. An agreement was subsequently reached between the parties ceding the Badger-Two Medicine wild- lands to the United States. In this agreement, the Blackfeet reserved * Dr. Vest is Director, Library/Humanities at the Blackfeet Community College, Browning, Montana. B.S. (1980) University of Washington, Seattle; M.A., M.I.S.

Some localities have a more marked tendency than others to produce better or worse men, and we are not to legislate in the face of the facts. Some, I conceive, owe their propitious or ill-omened character to variations in winds and sunshine, others to their waters, and yet others to the products of the soil, which not only provide the body with better or worse sustenance, but equally affect the mind for good or bad. Most markedly conspicuous of all, again, will be localities which are the homes of some supernatural influence, or the haunts of spirits who give a gracious or ungra- cious reception to successive bodies of settlers. A sagacious legislator will give these facts all consideration a man can, and do his best to adapt his legislation to them. So you, too, Clinia, must of course do the same. As the intended colonizer of a district you must give your first attention to such points. PLATO, LAWS, in The Collected Dialogues of Plato 747d-e. (E. Hamilton and H. Cairns eds. 1982). 455</page><page sequence="2">456 JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION [Vol. 6 rights "to go upon" these lands, to hunt and fish thereon, and to har- vest timber therein for personal and domestic use.2 The Badger-Two Medicine later became a unit within the Lewis and Clark National Forest. Traditional Blackfeet respect the Badger-Two Medicine as sacred land. The entire province of wildlands is regarded as a holy place.3 Located adjacent to the Bob Marshall wilderness, the Badger-Two Medicine is a de facto wilderness possessing untrammelled natural qualities; and it is this naturalness which potently empowers the land's sacredness to the traditional Blackfeet. These wildlands are therefore an ideal candidate for wilderness preservation under the protective provisions of the 1964 Wilderness Act (Wilderness Act of 1964, 16 U.S.L. ยง 1131 (1982)). Forest Service planners have de- clared that "the area is not available for wilderness classification be- cause of rights retained by the Blackfeet Tribe in the Agreement of 1896." In supporting this claim, the agency further argues that "under the Agreement, the Blackfeet Tribe retains the right to cut and remove timber," and because of this reserved right the area can- not be designated wilderness.4 The hypocrisy of this claim is evident 2.

Great Falls, MT: Forest Supervisor's Office, Lewis and Clark National Forest, June 4, 1986. This Forest Service claim that the "right to cut and remove timber" denies the option of legal wilderness designation is mistaken. A careful reading of the 1964 Wilderness Act acknowl- edges that timber may be cut where required for beneficial mining purposes in accordance with reasonable and sound management principles. Wilderness Act, Pub. L. No. 88-577, 78 Stat. 890 (1964) [see sec. 4(d)(e)]. Given this model, that is subject to valid existing rights prior to January 1, 1984, it is possible to include the Badger-Two Medicine area in a wilderness designation while acknowledging the Blackfeet's beneficial timber privileges under the 1896 Agreement (supra note 2). Indeed, such a model was enacted when Congress returned 48,000 acres of the Carson National Forest to the people of Pueblo de Taos in New Mexico; this sacred wildland, the Blue Lake watershed, was revested tot he Taos people provided the lands "remain forever wild" and "Be maintained as a wilderness as defined in section 2(c) of the Act of September 3, 1964 (78 Stat. 890)." Act approved Dec. 15, 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-550, 84 Stat. 1437 (1970) ]see sec. 4(b)]. In this same Act of revestment, Congress provisioned the beneficial use of wood and timber by the tribe despite the official mandate of wilderness preser- vation cited above. Id. at sec. 4(a). Clearly then, the Forest Service statement denying poten- tial wilderness designation on the grounds of Blackfeet timber rights is in error. Furthermore, the Forest Service apparently made no effort to protect Blackfeet reserved rights when it leased the area for oil and gas exploration and development.</page><page sequence="3">BLACKFEET SACRED PLACES when one recognizes the earlier Forest Service decision to lease the area for oil and gas exploration, as if this activity would not interfere with Blackfeet reserved rights. The inconsistency manifest in the For- est Service plan reflects an arbitrary design to facilitate a comprehen- sive program of oil and gas development. The plan's implementation will violate traditional Blackfeet religious practice within the Badger- Two Medicine area. Consequently, practicing Blackfeet traditional- ists have joined conservationists in appealing what appears to be a dishonest Forest Service decision. In light of this controversy, it is the purpose of this essay to ex- amine the recorded literature documenting a traditional claim to the area's sacredness. OVERVIEW: NATIVE AMERICAN ECOLOGICAL VALUES A central issue of Native American religious practice is the over- riding value attributed to nature and ecological integrity. Christopher Vecsey calls the practices based on this ethos "Indian environmental religion." He explains that its goal is harmony with nature, ethical reciprocity in the human species' relationship with the "non-human persons" of nature. There is, therefore, a spiritual affinity between Indians and wild nature.5 The Swedish scholar Ake Hultkrantz fur- thers this view, emphasizing the ecological integration of religious thinking and practice among Native Americans. He explains that there is a "cosmotheistic interpretation of nature" that includes the concept of the earth as sacred ground that can be ruined by digging or similar destructive acts. In addition, for traditional Native Americans there is a sacred unity of nature, humanity, and "supernatural pow- ers" that requires the moral acknowledgement of wild nature. The consequence of these beliefs is that spirits of nature are fully inte- grated into all aspects of social, cultural, and environmental activity, and are therefore definitive in traditional religious practice.6 Profes- sor Joseph Epes Brown sums it up when he states that the Indians' attitude of reverence for nature and for life is the central tenet of their 5.

This misunderstanding of Native American tradi- tions undergirds the treaty system and its reservation method of land tenure; sacred lands were often taken from Indian tribes and included in National Forests and other public lands. Recognizing these condi- tions, in one example, Congress returned the Taos Indians' sacred Blue Lake and environs to the tribe. In addition, the American In- dian Religious Freedom Act (A.I.R.F.A.)9 was enacted by Congress to ensure to Indians the free exercise of religion. This statute thus affirms the special trust or fiduciary responsibilities required of the federal government in respecting Native American religion. A.I.R.F.A.'s significance may be in focusing attention on Indian reli- gious traditions and their sense of environmental ethics, in contradis- tinction to the American system of land tenure.

It is acknowledged that the Blackfeet were probably the earliest Algonquian-speaking residents of the plains, and that they occupied this area long before the "discov- ery" of America.1 When referring to the Blackfeet Indian nation, scholars recognize three closely related tribes-the Pikuni or Piegans, the Kainah or Bloods, and the Siksikau or Blackfoot; furthermore a traditional Blackfoot Confederacy includes the (Algonquian) Atsina or Gros Ventres and the (Athabascan) Sarsis.12 Native American logic is centered in an oral language, thereby preserving continuity across entire linguistic families, in this case, Al- gonquian.'3 It is my thesis that the Algonquian peoples hold being to be a form of becoming and because of this ontological position, they take a different moral view than that of the dominant Western tradi- tion. When these Native Americans refer to their "grandfathers" and "grandmothers," they mean a wide array of "other-than-human per- sons," including animals, plants, rocks, and ecological processes. In acknowledging entire natural ecosystems to be their "grandmothers" and "grandfathers," the Algonquians demonstrate an all-inclusive moral system that sponsors environmental ethics. Hence, within this world view and ethos, the "land"-collectively all animals, plants, soil, etc.-is not a salable commodity, but rather the sacred "grandfa- thers" and "grandmothers" of the people.14 11.

Grinnell points out the similarity of Black- feet stories and eastern Algonquian tales: he explains, "The reader of these Blackfoot stories will not fail to notice many curious resemblances to tails told among other distant and different peoples. Their similarity to those current among the Ojibwas, and other Eastern Algonquian tribes, is sufficiently obvious and altogether to be expected, nor is it at all remarkable that we should find, among the Blackfeet, tales identical with those told by tribes of different stock far to the south" by these latter tribes, Grinnell refers to the other Plains Algonquian peoples- the Cheyenne and the Arapha.

Each rock, plant, animal, etc., including the ele- mental processes, is recognized to have a spirit, and therefore to be morally significant. These beings are seen as "persons," but in a cate- gory other than human, hence "other-than-human persons" or "grandmothers" and "grandfathers." The Blackfeet word is naahks'. No distinction is made between the human familiar naahks' and the spiritual naahks'; both are to be respected, and both have "powers." Humans, however, must seek out their "powers" by engaging the other-than-human naahks', asking them to have pity and give of their powers to the human person. Furthermore, the Western conceptual distinction of "natural" and "supernatural" is nonexistent. The phe- nomena of the world are not natural objects in the contemporary sense at all, but "persons" of the "other-than-human" class of being, and, therefore, personal as in "our grandfathers" and "grandmoth- ers." Hence, the "land" as an ecosystem is personal and honored as the people's naahks' to be respected as an elder human person. Ac- cordingly, the "land" is held sacred among the traditional Blackfeet, and any commercial encroachment upon it is blasphemous because such intrusion profanes its sacred character.15 Traditional Blackfeet Religion Illustrating the sacredness of the "land" in a specific Blackfeet context, Walter McClintock writes: The Great Spirit, or Great Mystery, or Good Power, is everywhere and in everything-mountains, plains, winds, waters, trees, birds, and animals.'6 tions Upon an Ultimate Animating Life Principle," in "Wilderness and Environmental Ethics: A Philosophy of Wilderness Praxis," Ph.D.Dissertation 1987 (available at the University of Montana). 15.

This onto- logical position is one of becoming rather than stasis, and it is signifi- cant for environmental ethics. Moreover, it is not to the Sun as a static being in the world (as the Western Tradition views it) that the Blackfeet pray, but to a being who is in the world as a person, who is both present and in process. The Sun is a being requiring dutiful re- spect and moral consideration. Consequently, they pray to an "other- than-human person" who also represents the timeless principle of life.

THE OLD NORTH, supra note 16, at 169-70. "The Sun, as the great centre of power and the upholder of all things, was the Blackfeet's supreme object of worship. He saw that every bud and leaf and blossom turned its face towards the Sun as the source of its life and growth; that the berries he ate reddened and ripened under its warmth; that men and animals thrived under its sustaining light, but all perished when it was withdrawn. He saw that in the darkness and cold of winter, nature retired into silence and sleep; that when the sunlight and warmth of spring returned, all nature awakened and put on its robe of gbreen; the bears left their hibernating dens and the beavers their winter lodges. The Sun made the grass to grow and the trees to be covered with foliage for substistence of the birds and animals, upon which men, women and children and everything that had breath to worship the all-glorious, all- powerful, Sun-God who fills the heavens with life and beauty. To them, he is the supreme source of light, of life, and of power." Id. Presenting this same point today, P. BULLCHILD, THE SUN CAME DOWN: THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AS MY BLACKFEET ELDERS TOLD IT 325 (1985) "Our people of the Piegans call this Creator Nah-doo-si, Holy One, or as others call him, Sun. I think praying to the sun itself is the truest form of religion or faith. The sun doesn't have any certain nationality or color, it is just the sun, and high above us all with its life-giving elements, the power of its rays to make our food grow. The sun has been in exist- ence from time beginning, when no other beings were on this earth, no one to call it something else, God didn't come into existence until the Europeans brought him into this world, when they invented God to make their misdoings good."

The principle is shared by the Sun with all creation and it is this power that the people beseech in dreams, prayers, songs, and ceremonies. With this metaphysical reflection upon Blackfeet Sun worship, we should conclude that the Blackfeet, like other Algonqui- ans, do not worship an anthropomorphic God, but venerate an ulti- mate animating life principle that they associate with the Sun and with the principals of creation, including the collective ecology of the earth.18 When looking into Blackfeet religion from a Western perspec- tive, one might conclude Na'pi (Old Man) to be a High God or Supreme Being, but such is not the case. Acknowledged as the Black- feet Creator, Na'pi is a compound expression of the word Ni'nah, man, and the particle a 'pi, which expresses a color, and which is never used by itself, but always in combination with some other word. George Bird Grinnell further explains that a'pi really conveys the tint of early morning light-the dawn-which is an off-color white with a faint yellow cast: ergo, Na'pi seems to mean dawn-light-color-man, or man-yellowish-white. This shade is precisely the color of an old Blackfeet man's or woman's hair. A central point here is that light is the most important thing in life. In this context, the beginning of the day is analogous to the beginning of the world, and since light comes before the Sun-creates it or brings it forth, so to speak-then it is the antecedent of the Sun as the Creator. Accordingly, this Creator, Na'pi, is an "other-than-human person" or "grandfather" and "grandmother" exemplifying the metaphysics previously posited.19 18. Wissler &amp; Duvall, supra note 13, at 10 (explain the sun's "other-than-human person" nature; further reflecting the process ontology are chants, songs, and prayers, such as "Great Spirit in the Sun!" "Sacred Spririt in the Sun!" "Great Sun Power! and "Great Mystery in the Sun!"). See THE OLD NORTH, supra note 16, at 85, 98, 175, 248, 297, 305, 210, 418 &amp; 470 (for examples). Modes of Contemplation, supra note 7, at 59 (provides further understanding for this metaphysical position as it immutably conjoins material principal with spiritual principle; he explains: "The tree at the center of the Sun dance lodge, then, does not just represent the axis of the world, but it is that axis and is the center of the world. The eagle is not a symbol of the sun, but is the sun in a certain sense; and similarly the sun is not a 'symbol of' the creative Principle, but it is that Principle as manifested in the Sun.") Id. Because of this ontological position's difference with the Western Tradition, the "supernatural" is a common way of refer- encing this process: it is, however, misleading since the "supernatural" is a Western concep- tual distinction which is not recognized among these religions. 19. BLACKFOOT LODGE TALES, supra note 13, at 256-57 (contends that the idea of light as the Creator would be absurd to the Blackfeet of today: "The statement that Old Man was merely light personified would be beyond his comprehension, and if he did understand what was meant, he would laugh at it, and aver that Na 'pi was a real man, a flesh and blood person like himself"). Id. The personification of light and Na'pi is not as incongruent as Grinnell implies here; moreover, Na'pi is an "other-than-human person," therefore sharing the attrib- [Vol. 6 464</page><page sequence="11">BLACKFEET SACRED PLACES Grinnell was told by two or three old men that "the Sun is the person whom we call Old Man, thus, the Sun is confirmed as an "other-than-human person." In keeping with the Algonquian tradi- tion, the Blackfeet religion personifies the ecological processes and el- ements-e.g., "Above Persons," "Ground Persons," "Underwater Persons," "Thunderer," "Wind Maker," "Cold Maker," etc.-as well as animals, plants, rocks, and soils of the "land." The "land" is, therefore, respected collectively as the naahks' of the Blackfeet people and is sacred within the context of their traditional religion.20 Given this explanation of Blackfeet metaphysics, it is appropriate to inquire, as James Willard Schultz did of Old Bull in 1869, "Who started the Blackfeet praying to the Sun-not all tribes do?" Old Bull answered by recounting the myth of Scarface. Recognized among the Blackfeet as the story of Star Boy or Poia (Scarface), this myth (sa- cred story) is acknowledged as the most ancient tradition of their religion.21 According to the myth, on a warm, cloudless night, Feather Wo- man (Soatsaki) was sleeping outside her tipi in the long grass when Morning Star, rising beautifully above the prairie, came and made love to her. In the Autumn, she found herself with child; yet she was a pure maiden, for none of the men had been with her. Coming to earth and making himself known to her, Morning Star invited Feather Woman to his home in the sky, where she went to live with him and his parents-father Sun and mother Moon. utes of light with the attributes of personhood. In consequence, this example is an ontological acknowledgement of material principal-Old Man-representing spiritual principle-light- such as I outlined earlier. See also BLACKFEET TALES OF GLACIER, supra note 16, at 97 (concurs with Grinnell declaring that the meaning of Na'pi is "dawn, or the first faint, white light that gives birth to the day." Thus, "the original religion of the Blackfeet was the worship of light personified."). Further demonstrating the personhood of Na'pi, see Ewers, supra note 10, at 145 (points to his role as trickster explaining "It is significant they looked upon Old Man not only as the Creator but as a humorous little fellow who went around trying to play tricks on people and animals and whose tricks sometimes backfired. Many Na 'pi stories are not only funny, but obscene."). Id. Wissler &amp; Duvall, supra note 13, at 10-11 (records Na'pi's role as "the blunderer, the immoral mischief-maker")' see also Id. at 53 (for Na'pi's role as creator). 20.

Feather Woman and Star Boy were banished to the earth when she disobeyed the command of the Sun and dug up a large, sacred turnip. Going each morning before daybreak with Star Boy to the summit of a high ridge, Feather Woman mourned her banishment and pleaded with Morning Star to take her back. In her grief, Feather Woman died; Star Boy was left alone without relatives and was sub- jected to much abuse because he was born in the sky with a mysteri- ous scar upon his face. He was ridiculed because of this scar, and in derision the people called him Poia (scarface). Poia was rejected by the maiden he loved, and in despair learned that only the Sun God could remove the scar from his face. With the help of a kindly medicine woman, Poia journeyed to the mountains, following the path of the Sun. When he reached the Sun's lodge, he was helped by his father Morning Star, and the Sun God agreed to remove the scar. In doing so, the Sun God appointed Poia to be his "messenger to the Blackfeet, promising, if they would give a festival (Sun-dance) in his honor once a year, that he would restore their sick to health. He taught Poia the secrets of the Sun-dance, and instructed him in the prayers and songs to be used." Poia then re- turned to the earth and the Blackfeet camp by the Wolf Trail (Milky Way), and there he instructed his people in the ways of the Sun- dance. Subsequently, the Sun God took him and the girl he loved back to the sky, and there they became a bright star-Mistake Morn- ing Star (Jupiter)-like Poia's father Morning Star (Venus).22 The origin of the Medicine Lodge-Sun Dance Lodge-is ac- counted for through this Scarface myth. Considered the primary reli- gious ceremonial among the Blackfeet, the Sun-dance is "their holy sacrament, the supreme expression of their religion." In opening the Sun-dance, wise man, Omistaipokah (White Calf) prayed to the ele- mental powers: Great-Sun Power! I am praying for my people that they may be happy in the summer and that they may live through the cold of winter. ... Help us, Mother Earth! for we depend upon your goodness....

Great Spirit! bless our children, friends, and visitors through a happy life .. .,23 Many of the Blackfeet legends, "medicines," or "powers" have been transmitted to the people by the Sun, and they are therefore impor- tant in honoring the Sun. Prominent among these "powers" are medicine pipe bundles. Percy Bullchild explains that the holy pipe bundles carry the peoples' prayers to the Sun. Grinnell adds that a keeper of the pipe is a priest of the Sun-Ninamp'skan (All-Face- Man), and prayers to the Sun are offered through him with the help of the pipe. Such prayers are made for the sick, before dangerous expe- ditions (such as departing for war), for the people's general health and prosperity, and for a bountiful supply of food.24 The medicine pipe originates with Thunder, who lives in the mountains. Lighting the pipe is therefore central in honoring Thun- der. In addition, "Of all the Blackfeet medicines, the pipe is believed to have the greatest power, but it also brings the greatest burden." While the care of a sacred pipe involves many careful rules, one of prominence concerns the grizzly bear. "The word 'bear' was believed to exert an evil power over the pipe, and should never be spoken in its presence." As a result, the word "badger" was substituted for the word "bear" when in the presence of the medicine pipe.25 Among Native Americans, and the Blackfeet are no exception, dreams or visions are centrally important in receiving religious in- 23.

As Grinnell comments: "They are firm believers in dreams. These, they say, are sent by the Sun to enable us to look ahead, to tell what is going to happen." Knowledge of the future, whether valuable to oneself or the tribe, is obtained in the solitude of "a remote region among the Rocky Mountains." In fasting and praying, sometimes for many days, the visionary excites the compassion of "other-than- human persons" who transmit the Sun's message. "The revelation, and with it the gift of power, generally" comes "in a dream through the medium of one of the more powerful animals, such as the buffalo, beaver, wolf or grizzly bear" or through "the personified natural forces, such as the Thunder Chief, Wind-Maker, or Es-to-ne-a- pesta,-Maker of Storms and Blizzards." In receiving their powers from the Sun, the "other-than-human persons" may bestow this power upon humans, and if, for example, a grizzly bear confers his or her powers upon a human, then that person can expect to attain the nature of a grizzly."26 It generally takes four days of solitary fasting and prayer to ob- tain a spirit helper and a dream for power in life endeavors. Wild- lands or wilderness are necessary for this traditional Blackfeet vision quest, as Grinnell explains: It was deemed essential that the place to which a man resorted for this purpose should be unfrequented, where few or no persons had walked; and it must also be a place that tried the nerve, where there are some dangers. Such situations were mountain peaks; or narrow ledges on cut cliffs, where a careless movement might cause a man to fall to his death on the rocks below."27 26. BLACKFEET AND BUFFALO, supra note 12, at 306, 349 (emphasizes the Blackfeet be- lief that dreams are actual experiences); BLACKFOOT LODGE TALES, supra note 13, at 263 (continues "A dream, especially if it is a strong one,-that is, if the dream is very clear and vivid,-is almost always obeyed. As dreams start, them on the war path, so, if a dream threat- ening bad luck comes to a member of the war party, even if in the enemy's country, and just about to make an attack on a camp, the party is likely to turn about and go home without making any hostile demonstrations. The animal or object which appears to the boy or man, who is trying to dream for power, is, as has been said, regarded thereafter as his secret helper, his medicine, and is usually called his dream (Nits-o'-kan)"; Modes of Contemplation, supra note 7, at 62 (delcares the retreat or "vision quest" to be the foundation of Native American religion and it is "the most profound spiritual dimension at the heart of these cultures," in the vision quest, "the individual opens himself in the most direct manner to contact with the spiritual essences underlying the forms of the manifested world."

BLACKFOOT LODGE TALES, supra note 13, at 191-92. 468 [Vol. 6</page><page sequence="15">BLACKFEET SACRED PLACES Clark Wissler furthers this point on the need for wilderness solitude in dream experiences when he declares that dreaming at home may be abortive and may fail to convey power.28 The sacred pipe is always taken with the visionary so that when a spirit or dream arrives, the helper can smoke. No special class of helpers is sought out; rather all "other-than-human persons" are prayed to alike. When the helper appears in a dream, it advises the visionary-directing his course through life and giving him its power. Even in death, the dream experience is honored. For example, Mc- Clintock records that the wise man Kattana requested that following his death "his body might be placed on the summit of the high butte, where he had been accustomed to go to have his dreams."29 Disease among the Blackfeet is considered to be caused by evil spirits, ghosts of slain enemies who, in a modern context, can be thought of as equivalent to those who would contribute to ecological degradation and create environmental waste of wildlands. Indeed, be- cause of the religion's ecological orientation, if the sacred "lands" are desecrated, the entire religion is lost or devoid of its most significant locus of value. This position, that trouble will come to the Blackfeet if their "land" is desecrated, is reinforced by a Blackfeet creation myth wherein Na'pi (Old Man) comments: "Here I will mark you off a piece of ground." The boundaries he gave for this land begin at a point along the summit of the Rocky Mountains west of Edmonton, Alberta; and "taking in the country to the east and south, including the Porcupine Hills, Cypress Mountains, and Little Rocky Moun- tains, down to the mouth of the Yellowstone, and across the Rocky Mountains to the Beaver-head; thence to the summit of the Rocky Mountains and north along them to the starting-point." Na'pi further advised the Blackfoot Confederacy, including the Gros Ventres and Sarcees, to permit no other people into this land. Should other people cross the line, the Blackfeet were counseled to take "bows and ar- rows," "lances and battle axes, and give them battle." "Trouble," Na'pi declared, "will come to you if they gain a footing."30 28. Wissler, supra note 25, at 104-05; RELIGION OF INDIANS, supra note 6, at 77 (also recognizes the wilderness requirement essential to vision quest settings, he comments "Typi- cally, the vision of the guardian spirit is individual, sought and obtained in solitude and isola- tion out in the wilderness-for example, on secluded mountains and hills"); this conclusion comports with Modes of Contemplation, supra note 7, at 62. 29.

First, the inclusion of the Gros Ventres and Sarcees indicates that it is declared prior to Euro-American influence when tension brought on by the invaders severed the traditional alliance between the Blackfeet tribes and the Gros Ventres. As for the second point, reference to weapons for defence of this territory does not include guns. All weapons cited by Na'pi are pre-Columbian arms. Accordingly, this mythic charge has the authority of pre-dating white contact and the desecration of traditional Blackfeet lands. THE RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BADGER-TWO MEDICINE WILDLANDS The "Backbone-of-the-World" is the name given by the Black- feet to the Rocky Mountains; and Thunder lives in "the inaccessible crags and caves of the high mountain-peaks" in this vicinity. A sa- cred landscape, the "Backbone-of-the-World" is home to other "pow- ers" or "other-than-human persons" including Cold Maker, Wind Maker, the Medicine Elk, the Medicine Wolf, and the Medicine Griz- zly. Emphasizing the role of these mountains in the Blackfeet tradi- tion, the tipi McClintock used while living with the Blackfeet was painted with a mythic motif, he explains: "The Sun and Morning Star were at the back with sun dogs at the sides and a rainbow beneath. In two perpendicular rows, one on each side of the door, were represent- atives of Rocky Mountain peaks." This decor has great meaning in that, traditionally, upon entering such a lodge, one experiences the representational presences and powers that adorn it. Thus, McClin- tock's lodge gave him the powers of the Rocky Mountains, among others.31 32 The Badger-Two Medicine area lies within the traditional con- 31. THE OLD NORTH, supra note 16, at 13 (reports this appropriate name ("Back-bone- of-the-World") for the Rocky Mountains, but it is used widely throughout the literature). For reference to Thunder see Thunderbird Myth, supra note 25, at 164-68; THE OLD NORTH, supra note 16, at 266; and further he states that "The legendary habitation of the Thunderbird was usually in a high mountain, or inaccessible craig in the tribes vicinity," id. at 520. Contempo- rary Keeper of a Sacred Pipe bundle, George Kipp, points out "We were shown where Thun- der lives. He lives in those mountains up there." With this point, Kipp is referencing the Badger-Two Medicine wildlands, see Schultz, Sacred Land, 2 MISSOULA MUSE 7 (1986). In accounting for the home of Wind Maker, see THE OLD NORTH, supra note 16, at 60-62; and for the Medicine Wolf and the Medicine Grizzly, see id. at 466-78; and for McClintock's lodge decor, id. at 222. 32.

Furthermore, this area includes the southern headwaters of the Two Medicine River. Pointing out the sacred origin of this name-Two Medicine-James Willard Schultz tells us that the river was known as the "Two Sun- Lodges River." McClintock confirms that the "Two Medicine was named, because we once had a double piskun there. We drove the buffalo over one, or the other, as we chose." While we tend to view the Badger-Two Medicine area as separate from the eastside wild- lands of Glacier National Park, this distinction is largely arbitrary due to administrative boundaries imposed by the different federal agencies (Forest Service-U.S.D.A. and National Park Service- U.S.D.I.). The division is also due in part to development along the Great Northern railway and U. S. highway 2 corridor through Marias Pass. For Blackfeet traditionalists, though, the sacred Two Medicine River heads in both Glacier National Park to the north and the Badger-Two Medicine wildlands to the south; thus the sacred quali- ties of the Two Medicine River are shared on both sides of the rail- road-highway corridor. The Birch Tree and the Origin of Wind Further reflecting the traditional homelands of Na'pi and the Blackfeet is Birch Creek which "was named because of the groves of birches along its shores." Birch Creek forms the southern boundary of the Badger-Two Medicine area and it is the site of Na'pi's mythic encounter with the wind. In this account, a bobcat steals Na'pi's roasted prairie dogs; in turn, the bumbling trickster is angry with his nose which failed to alert him to the thieving bobcat. Scolding his nose, he declares, "You fool, why did you not wake me?" In retribu- tion upon his nose, Na'pi returns to his fire and thrusts willow sticks into the hot coals, and when the sticks catch fire, he burns his nose. The pain wrought by this punishment is severe, so Na'pi decides that a cool wind may ease his suffering whereupon he begins chanting "Iik-so-boo-tah, Iik-so-boo-tah, Iik-so-boo-tah" ("Blow harder, Blow harder, Blow harder"). As Na'pi repeats this chant, a great wind de- velops and blows him down to Birch Creek where he at last seizes a birch tree standing fast against the wind. The tree saves Na'pi from being knocked to pieces and, in gratitude, he declares that the birch is a most beautiful tree deserving distinctive ornamentation; thus, the trickster, using his stone knife, ornaments the tree with the gashes 455] 471</page><page sequence="18">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION that you see today.33 Acknowledging that Wind Maker lives in the mountains and that Birch Creek comprises the southern border of the Badger-Two Medicine, this mythic account of Na'pi's creative adven- ture imparts an essential sacred meaning to these wildlands. Clearly he was blown south to Birch Creek which means he was blown through the Badger-Two Medicine area. Badger Creek and the Medicine Grizzly According to McClintock, Badger Creek was named "on ac- count of the many large badgers seen along its banks .. ." This stream, which drains Goat Mountain, is very significant when ex- amined from the perspective of the sacred pipe that McClintock re- corded; moreover, Lone Chief raised the pipe and faced the four directions, chanting initially towards the West-"Over there are the mountains. May you see them as long as you live, for from them you must receive your sweet pine as incense."34 Recognizing that these mountains are the home of Thunder and that Thunder is the giver of the sacred pipe (and further that "badger is substituted for bear" in the presence of the pipe), it is apparent that Badger Creek is Bear Creek. Furthermore, because the grizzly bear is among the most powerful totems or helpers, and is today an endangered species, it must be concluded that these wildlands are of highest importance to Blackfeet traditional religion. Illustrating this point, James Willard Schultz describes an encounter with a grizzly that helps to explain the bear's sacred role. In this account, Raven Calling (a Thunder Pipe owner) encounters, with his companions, the kill of a "real bear" (grizzly); as a result, he offers the following prayer: "Haiyu! Sun! All you Above-People! All you creatures of the air, the earth, and the deep waters! All of you, we ask that you pity us; aid us to survive all dangers that we may meet, help us to find that which we seek in the Far Southland.

Just as he finishes, a "real-bear" of great size emerges from the timber along the opposite shore; there- upon, whispering to the others he declares: "Ha! See that. We pray to him and he comes out from his resting-place, a sure sign that the gods accept our smoke and are with us!"35 Clearly, the survival of the grizzly bear is essential to traditional Blackfeet religious practice because prayers are made to living animals who in turn may grant one's sacred entreaties. Thus the Badger-Two Medicine wildlands have a particular importance as a wilderness sanctuary for these sa- cred "real-bears." These points concerning the medicine power of the grizzly bear and the essential requirement of wilderness are further affirmed in the legend of the Friendly Medicine Grizzly. Legend of the Friendly Medicine Grizzly In this mythic account, the Medicine Grizzly befriends Blackfeet cultural hero-Nistae (Calf Robe)-who has been severely wounded in a raid against the Snakes (Shoshones). Nistae is saved when the Medicine Grizzly carries him northward along the "Backbone" to the Blackfeet camp along the Marias River. In gratitude, Nistae invites the bear to live with him, but the Grizzly refuses, saying "The moon is now nearly past when the leaves fall off. It is time I should find a den, for the heavy snows of winter will soon come. The only favor I ask of you in return is, that you will never kill a bear that has holed itself up for the winter." Turning westward to the mountains, the Medicine Grizzly departs for his home and as a result of his request the Blackfeet will not kill a hibernating bear.36 This myth establishes a fundamental moral relationship between the Blackfeet and the Medicine Grizzly who represents all "real-bears." It is significant that the Medicine Grizzly departed westward to the mountains from 35. J.W. SCHULTZ (Apikuni), PLUMED SNAKE MEDICINE 66-67 (1924). 36.

In turn the bear offers his help to Mika'pi by feeding him berries, by plastering his arm with mud, and by carrying him four days to the Pikuni lodges. Upon reaching the Pikuni camp, the bear speaks telling Mika'pi "Get off, my brother get off. There are your people. I must leave you." And without another word the bear turned and went off up into the mountains). Clearly this bear is the Medicine Grizzly or Chief Bear; and in his returning home to the mountains, he is returning home to the Badger- Two Medicine area.

Legend of the Friendly Medicine Wolf This Blackfeet ecological ethos of morally considering animals is further affirmed in the legend of the friendly Medicine Wolf. In this account, a young mother-Itsapichkaupe (Sits-by-the-door)-is cap- tured by a Crow war party. She was taken over two hundred miles to the Crow camp on the Yellowstone (Elk) River; there Itsapichkaupe was given to one of her captor's friends. Taking pity on the Pikuni captive, a kindly Crow woman provides for Itsapichkaupe's escape and gives her a pair of moccasins, a flint, and a small sack filled with pemmican. During her long journey home, Itsapichkaupe's provisions are soon exhausted; she finds herself deep in despair when a large wolf approaches her. As the wolf lay at her feet, however, she beseeches his aid, saying: "Pity me, brother wolfl I am so weak for food that I must soon die. I pray for the sake of my young children that you will help me." In response the wolf drew near her and she was able to walk by placing her hands on the wolf's back; the wolf seemed eager to bear her weight and he hunted everyday supplying her with meat. Thanks to the friendly wolf, Itsapichkaupe safely reached the Pikuni camp where she related her story and the role of the Medicine Wolf in her long journey. Although she tried to feed the wolf, the Indian dogs attacked him, and drove him into the hills. The faithful wolf remained nearby and came every evening to a high butte, where he sat gazing down at Itsapichkaupe's lodge. Believing the wolf and coyote to be good medicine, the Pikuni never shoot them; indeed they have a saying, "The gun that shoots at a wolf or coyote will never again shoot straight."37 Thus like the Medicine Grizzly, the wolf is protected in the moral philosophy of traditional Blackfeet; these views represent a significant environmental ethic which is confirmed in the legend recounting a time when men and animals were friendly. Legend When Men and Animals Were Friendly Early one winter in the long-ago, the Pikuni arose from their camp to find no animals on which to sustain themselves. At first, eating dried meat and pemmican, no one in camp seemed concerned 37. THE OLD NORTH, supra note 16, at 473-76. [Vol. 6 474</page><page sequence="21">BLA CKFEET SACRED PLACES about the vanished herds, but as the supply of food diminished, the tribe decided to move off in search of them. One man, White Eagle, decided to remain where he was; he and his two wives and son soon exhausted their food supply and began to starve. North of the starving family, all the various kinds of meat-eating animals were in winter camp. With the power of metamorphosis given them by the Sun, the animals could assume human form; and one day the chief of the animals, Spotted Wolf, discovered the starv- ing people. The animal chiefs councilled and decided to send the sons of Big Wolf, Coyote, Red Fox, and Black Fox to aid the humans. Carrying food and assuming human form, the medicine animals en- tered White Eagle's lodge. On behalf of the animals' head chief, Spot- ted Wolf, the four visitors invited White Eagle and his family to the great animal camp where plenty of food was available. Throughout the winter, the animals hosted White Eagle and his family in their lodges. In supplying the family's needs for food, Big Wolf, the Chief of the animals, explains: "The reason I am having you all invite this human being to visit you in your lodges is, that he and his women are not our kind, and I want you to become well ac- quainted with him." The generosity of the animals, however, de- pended upon the right behavior of White Eagle and his family. They were told never to pick up any property that might be lying about the camp or there would be trouble. When one day White Eagle's son picked up a "beautifully straight, flint-tipped arrow, with eagle feath- ers on it," the "people" of the camp became the many kinds of ani- mals and began snapping and biting the boy. After White Eagle quickly sacrificed upon the fire the gifts that Big Wolf had provided to the family, all the animals returned to their metamorphosed state as human persons. Responding to this trouble, Big Wolf admonished White Eagle that this mistake must not be repeated. Following this event, the Badger Chief invited White Eagle to his lodge. White Eagle had been advised to avoid the Badger Chief's Lodge and he dreaded this invitation. His anxiety was heightened when the Badger Chief declared: "It is well for you that you came at my third call. If I had been obliged to call a fourth time-well, I will only say that it is all right now." With these remarks, Badger Chief cast incense of powdered turnip onto the coals and sang: The earth is sacred. My lodge is sacred. We, the Badgers, are The most powerful 455] 475</page><page sequence="22">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION of all the animals. The Badger Chief then gave White Eagle his lodge and sacred songs; this is why "the skin of the badger, as well as the skins of the other animals that were in that great camp circle, is always used in the cere- monies connected with the building of the great lodge that" the Blackfeet give to the Sun, every summer.38 This legend, together with those of the Medicine Grizzly and the Medicine Wolf, is particularly significant in documenting Blackfeet environmental ethics. The friendliness of the animals and humankind sets a precedent for ecological interdependence and right behavior be- tween the parties. We learn from the myth that the animals may as- sume our form and give assistance to us when we most need it, provided we respect them. The taking of the arrow symbolizes hunt- ing and we see the result in the animus shown the offending boy. When White Eagle sacrifices his gifts, the sacred-moral relationship between humans and animals is again established and all is well. Thus, practice of traditional beliefs is central in maintaining an eco- logical balance in hunting endeavors; furthermore, the metamorphosis of the animals demonstrates the metaphysical position outlined earlier in this essay. The animals are humanity's relatives, honored "grand- mothers and grandfathers"; they are "other-than-human persons" in one respect, but persons in the most fundamental moral context. This kinship with the animals and the moral obligations of respect required in religious practice demonstrates a sensitive and sophisticated envi- ronmental ethic among Blackfeet Traditionalists. The Badger relations with humankind is another point deserving attention. All the other meat-eating animals, excepting wolverine who was absent from the great camp, gave sacred songs and medicine to White Eagle and presumably to humankind. On the significance accorded the Badger clan, it must be recognized that this legend is older than the horse period, when badger holes became a great hazard to men hunting bison. The substitution rule-badger for bear-may once again be in effect. Noting that the bear is omitted in the story despite its meat-eating capacity, and that the sacred song of the "badgers" declares them the most powerful of all the animals, clearly a capacity of the bear, one must again suspect the practice of substi- tuting badger for bear. The counsel to avoid the "badger" in the myth may further reflect the danger posed by accepting the unpredict- able hospitality of a "real-bear." Furthermore, in the case of the 38.

[Vol. 6 476</page><page sequence="23">BLA CKFEET SA CRED PLA CES Badger-Two Medicine as home to the Medicine Grizzly, the "badger" song confirms the area's sacredness: "The earth is sacred. My lodge is sacred." This declaration may properly be concluded to read: "my home-the Badger-Two Medicine-is sacred." The Kutoyis Myth The Medicine Grizzly is again a major "power" in the kutoyis (Blood-clot) myth which references the region as a place where "peo- ple" live: "Well," said the old man, "up above here on Badger Creek and Two Medicine, where the pis'kin is, there are some people." The meaning here is that the Badger-Two Medicine province is home to the "grandfathers and grandmothers" or "other-than-human per- sons"; the Blackfeet naahks' who share power with human persons. The Kutoyis myth begins at the confluence of Two Medicine and Badger Creek; after becoming a man, Kutoyis journeys into the moun- tains and there he encounters an old "real-bear" who is acknowledged to be "the chief of this place."39 Since the Chief Bear or Medicine Grizzly live in some far part of the earth "which the white men have not yet found and desecrated,"40 and given the aforementioned point that the mountains are home to the Medicine Grizzly, we must con- clude that this undesecrated land is the Badger-Two Medicine wildlands. Na'pi's Romance In the long-ago, when Na'pi created the world, he separated the men and women into two camps; the women were living in the mel- low Cutbank Valley and the men lived in the mountains along the Two Medicine River. Skilled at tanning hides and making clothing, the women used a piskun to secure meat and hides. Conversely, the men were without skill in fashioning clothing and tanning hides but they killed game using bows and arrows. Realizing this error of sepa- ration, Na'pi spoke to the men: "You shall no longer live by your- selves. Come! We will go up to the camp of the women, and each of us get one of them." All the men were more then willing to meet the women, so they dressed in their finery, particularly Na'pi who was the finest looking 39.

At the camp of the women, the men all stood in a row because the women had the right of choice. Although she was poorly dressed and dirty from butchering buffalo, the Chief of the women had the first choice. She walked up and down the line of men and finally she returned to Na'pi taking his hand. Na'pi, however, noticed many fine looking, well dressed women waiting their opportunity to select a mate and he rejected her. Angered by his rejection, the Chief Woman returned to her camp and cautioned all the women against selecting Na'pi. She then cleaned herself and dressed in her finest clothes. Returning to the hill where the men stood, the Chief Woman appeared transformed and was very fine looking; indeed, Na'pi thought her the best looking of all the women and he kept stepping in front of her so that he might be chosen. Ignoring Na'pi, the Chief Woman chose another man for her mate and all the other women followed her advice and left Na'pi alone, unselected at the conclusion of the mating. Na'pi became very angry that he was not chosen by a woman; and because of his behavior, the Chief Woman turned Na'pi into a pine tree which stands alone at the edge of the mountains where the plains begin. It is said that Blackfeet romance endures today because of the beauty where this event took place.41 In this myth, the Chief Woman is the "Keeper of women" and Na'pi is similarly the "Keeper of men." As such they require an undesecrated place. The sacredness of the Two Medicine River extends on both sides of the present rail- road-highway corridor, and this wild, mythic landscape must in part be the Badger-Two Medicine wildlands. Certainly the beauty repre- sented in this ecotone of great mountains and vast plains is no less striking today then when it sponsored romance between men and wo- men during the long-ago. The Poia (Scarface) Myth Perhaps the most significant confirmation of the sacredness of the Badger-Two Medicine area emerges from the Poia myth. In his 41. BLACKFEET TALES OF GLACIER, supra note 16, at 98-105; the editors of Historic Montana, 1959, v. 9:1 report that the men lived in the mountains south of the Two Medicine which means they were in the Badger-Two Medicine wildlands.

Bullchild, supra note 17, at 222-28 (also recounts this mythic courtship and places it in Alberta along the Highwood River). This location reflects the North Pikuni and the Kainah location for the courtship between men and women; thus, the apparent discrepancy of location is not a matter of error when pointing to the Two Medicine region of the Backbone for the South Pikuni. [Vol. 6 478</page><page sequence="25">BLA CKFEET SACRED PLACES quest to beseech the Sun to remove the scar, Scarface (Poia) goes first to the Sweet Pine (Grass) Mountains. There he is told to "go far to the west to some very large mountains and to the highest of them all. Scarface must sleep there to seek out the spirit of that mountain, who should know the answer to Scarface's question." In travelling west from the Sweet Pine Mountains, the highest peak encountered is Morning Star Mountain (elevation 8,376 feet) and it was Morning Star who assisted Scarface to win favor with the Sun. In keeping with the myth, the Badger-Two Medicine landscape includes Feather Wo- man Mountain, as well as Scarface Mountain and Mt. Poia. Scarface Mountain and Mt. Poia appear as one in line of sight from the Sweet Pine Mountains, and thus there is no discrepancy in their sharing the "Star Boy" identity. Furthermore, Scarface Mountain, at 8,282 feet, is only slightly smaller than Morning Star Mountain, which makes it consistent with the myth in which Morning Star is brighter than Mis- take Morning Star.42 The names of these Badger-Two Medicine peaks derive from the most important Blackfeet myth. They are a part of a mythic land- scape, and thereby the most sacred of lands. For in the traditional naming of a thing, the name imparts the essence of its meaning upon that which is named. Since the essential meaning given here is of the most sacred character, the landscape given these names is sacred. Outside the Badger-Two Medicine area, south of the middle fork of Birch Creek, the emphasis is upon Anglo-names such as Mt. Drewyer, Crooked Mountains, Hurricane Mountain, and Bennie Hill. But within the Badger-Two Medicine, the names include those of sa- cred myths and great chiefs-Little Plume Peak, Curly Bear Moun- tain, Spotted Eagle Mountain, Running Owl Mountain, Bull Shoe Mountain, and Running Crane Mountain-as well as important char- acteristics of religious values-e.g., Badger and Two Medicine. The importance of naming and its role in the people's beliefs is illustrated in a journey by a group of Blackfeet chiefs to Washington, D.C., in 1915 to meet with the director of the National Park Service to protest whiteman names for Glacier National Park topography.43 42.

SCHULTZ 455] 479</page><page sequence="26">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION The 1896 Agreement The proceedings of the 1896 Agreement further reveal the tradi- tional regard accorded these ceded lands by the Blackfeet. Little Dog begins the discussion stating: "The Indians did not ask the Govern- ment to come and buy their land ..." and in this concern, he is sup- ported by Little Bear Chief who declares: "when I was young the Great Spirit took pity on me for being a poor, ignorant man. I think [sic: thank?] my relations, I would like to know for what purpose you are here. (Demands an answer)."44 Little Bear Chief's remarks con- cerning the pity given him by the Great Spirit doubtlessly reflect his "medicine powers" obtained in dream or vision quest; furthermore his relations in this context must be acknowledged as "other-than-human persons" as those responsible for his "powers." His statement is most significant and the regard he held for the sacredness of Badger-Two Medicine wildlands will become apparent. Answering Little Bear Chief, Commissioner Pollack remarked, "Some of the men in Montana want the mountain land thrown open to them." Little Bear Chief responded, "we are all children of the Great Father. From Cut Bank north to the boundary line is what I wish to sell." To this statement, Commissioner Grinnell advised, "The line we have suggested will leave you plenty of timber for your uses." But it appears that the Blackfeet had other concerns in reserv- ing the lands south of the railway (i.e. the Badger-Two Medicine); indeed, Little Dog replied, "We do not want to sell land north from Birch Creek, but think that we will sell the land north of the railway."45 At this point, Commissioner Pollack cautioned the Blackfeet concerning the trouble which minerals in the mountains may cause them; he told them that "it would be impossible to keep white men off that portion of the reservation." Pollack continued by discounting the mountains' utility for the Blackfeet. Replying to this claim, Little Dog remarked "you are trying now to say that the mountains are of no benefit to us. I know that they are of some benefit to us." In response, Grinnell offered to leave without consummating the deal. He further chided the Blackfeet, declaring that they will soon be with- (Apikuni), BLACKFEET TALES OF GLACIER (1926); J.W.

To this, White Calf responded, "I am in favor of going away and councilling among ourselves";46 clearly, he felt the pressure which Grinnell's statement was calculated to pro- duce. White Calf was the tribal chief and he more than anyone was concerned with the tribal welfare. The burden of self-sufficiency in the post-bison era fell heavily upon him. Nevertheless, the Blackfeet continued to express their desire to reserve a portion of the mountains. Three Suns remarked: "Little Dog has told you what part of the mountains we want to sell, and we are willing to stand by him. You have said that the mountains are poor. No, they are rich ... we want to reserve a part of the moun- tains-as when a man is selling his horses, he keeps one for himself. Now, the Great Father is trying to take it from us. ... We have decided today to sell the mountains north of the railroad .. ."47 Horses, sacred animals, served as the primary standard of worth among these Indians, so that this concomitance between horses and the mountains implies a serious valuation of the latter. Reluctance to sell the mountains south to Birch Creek was again asserted by Middle Calf; and White Calf followed declaring: "This is the chief mountain in the country, and we now offer you it from the railroad to the boundary line. You think it is a small country from Cut Bank to the line. You can see the two points at once. The rail- road is the natural boundary, and it is from there that we now offer you.... Our Great Father will never be all gone. The mountains will never disappear. All people will get benefit from the mountains on both sides."48 It appears in this last remark that White Calf meant that both Indian and non-Indian will benefit from the mountains. Re- ferring to the division among the Blackfeet, Running Rabbit asserted that "All the people do not like to sell the mountains..." and Moun- tain Chief again confirms that "The land is very good."49 What motivated these Blackfeet leaders to hesitate to sell the mountains? Recalling the significance of the mountains earlier associ- ated with Little Bear Chief, we are given a clue when he again ex- presses himself: "When I heard that there was to be a treaty I thought I would not come. I will say but little. Before I came I could see that there would be trouble ahead. I don't think you are the cause of it. It 46. Id. at 12-14. 47. Id. at 14. 48. Id. at 14-15. 49.

When the majority de- cided to sell the land north from Cut Bank, it set very heavy. To- morrow I will go home, and if the Great Father wants to know how the majority came to the conclusion first in regard to the land north from Cut Bank and how they changed, let him come to me and find out. The way they talk today makes me think of a lot of hounds tearing at one another."50 Marked by anger, these are powerful re- marks implying a genuine disgust with the very idea of selling the mountains. Moreover, the majority decision to sell the mountains is a "very heavy" matter to Little Bear Chief and he is truly disgusted with the proceedings; a fact evidenced in his intention to leave the next morning. It is a pity that so sensitive a scholar as George Bird Grinnell failed to inquire of Little Bear Chief concerning the mystery he volunteers here. It is, however, well-known that religious leaders do not like to say negative things about their fellow tribesmen, no matter how seriously offended they may be. Little Bear Chief had medicine powers from the Great Spirit, and thus, one must suspect that he was a religious traditionalist at the time of these remarks. Ac- cordingly, his statement is an incredible testament against selling the mountains given his implicit indictment of his fellows. Coerced by their friends and with little choice, the Blackfeet agreed to sell the mountains and it is done when White Calf declared to all: "You are my relations." Poignantly he continued, "Chief Mountain is my head. Now my head is cut off. The mountains have been my last refuge. We have been driven here and now we are set- tled. From Birch Creek to the boundary line is what I give you."51 In concluding this discussion of the religious significance of the Badger-Two Medicine area, several main points must be acknowl- edged. First, the wildlands are sacred, a point supported by the pres- ence of "other-than-human persons" such as Thunder, Wind Maker, the Medicine Grizzly, etc., within the area, and further by the several myths incumbent upon the landscape. Second, traditional Blackfeet religion has been practiced in these Badger-Two Medicine mountains since time immemorial, as evidenced by Na 'pi's creation of the world and one requiring no further authority. Some anthropologists may dispute such a claim declaring the Blackfeet to be recent occupants of the area, that is, for a matter of centuries rather than for mythic eter- 50. Id. at 16. 51. Id. at 18-19. 482 [Vol. 6</page><page sequence="29">BLA CKFEET SACRED PLACES nity. But it is precisely this mythic understanding of kinship and reci- procity with the land-all rocks, plants, and animals-which empowers the Badger-Two Medicine as a sacred landscape. This is a religious empowerment and practice which continues to this day. Third, it is the wilderness qualities of the area that underlie its promi- nent religious significance to the Blackfeet. This fact is confirmed in the remarks of Morning Eagle (a medicine man) who explains the mysterious powers of untrammelled, wild nature. Citing the myth "when men and animals were friends" in the long-ago time, he de- clares "in these late days the old gods, Chief Wolf, Chief Bear and others, no longer come and talk with us in person, we know that they still roam the earth, that they live in some far part of it which the white men have not yet found and desecrated, and we have assurance that they still visit us in the spirit, unseen and unheard except as they appear to us in our dreams. Yes. And we know that they still heed our prayers and intercede for us with the sun, ruler of all, for his mercy and aid."52 The Badger-Two Medicine wildlands have been shown to be home to these gods-the Medicine Wolf, the Medicine Grizzly, and others-and, in their wildness, these lands have not yet been desecrated by the white man. Consequently, it must be empha- sized again that any activity inconsistent with the wilderness quality of the entire Badger-Two Medicine area will interfere with, if not de- stroy outright, Blackfeet traditional religious practice. Traditional Blackfeet hold sacred the "other-than-human per- sons" living in these wildlands, and these "persons" are essential, with their gifts of "power" and "medicine," to traditional Blackfeet reli- gious practice. The "other-than-human persons" are not confined to any particular locale, but are moving throughout a living landscape. In fact, these "other-than-human persons" are the "land"-all soils, rocks, plants, animals, and ecological processes-and one cannot ig- nore the interconnection of these "persons" within the scope of the Badger-Two Medicine's ecology and traditional Blackfeet religion. Moreover, these "persons" are included in both Little Bear Chief's and White Calf's references to relations. The Blackfeet acknowledge the implicit volitional powers of these ecological naahks' and thereby affirm the intrinsic value of the Badger-Two Medicine wildlands which nurture this traditional religious practice. The reluctance to sell these lands in 1895 is implicitly connected to this religion. Fur- 52.

Indeed, given the belief in the origin of disease, instability, or disharmony, potential disturbance of these sa- cred wildlands must be viewed as a threat against the entire cultural/ religious survival of the Blackfeet people. Affirming the contempo- rary significance of the Badger-Two Medicine wildlands, three recent sun lodges have been held on Badger Creek, which derives its power from these sacred mountains.53 CONCLUSION Several questions have arisen in connection with the Badger-Two Medicine public lands issue. Among these are questions concerning the nature of Blackfeet reserved rights within the Badger-Two Medicine area under the 1896 agreement, and the question of Forest Service failure to understand traditional Blackfeet religion and the sa- credness of the Badger-Two Medicine wildlands. The access clause of the 1896 agreement is no doubt a reflection of the Blackfeet people's desire to continue their religion, and therefore to be permitted "to go upon" these sacred lands for religious practice. Implied in the 1896 agreement is an understanding that the lands would continue undis- turbed in their wild condition. Further, since the Blackfeet have re- served hunting rights and ample wildlife is required for the hunt, it is implicit that the tribe expected wildlife habitat to be preserved and protected from endangering activities.54 At the time of the 1896 agreement, the Blackfeet people did not acknowledge the principles of land ownership as defined by the Western Tradition's private property system. Like other Native people, the Blackfeet practiced a territori- ality where they ranged upon the land as an ecological component. For them, the highest use of the land was hunting and gathering. 53. George Kipp, a 1986 Thunder Pipe Keeper confirms this point concerning the most recent Sun Lodges. 54. Protection of fish and wildlife habitat from acts of environmental degradation is im- pliedly reserved by the treaty, see United States v. Washington, 506 F. Supp. 187, 203-07 (W.D. Wash. 1980) (wherein the Court held "that implicitly incorporated in the treaties' fish- ing cluase is the right to have the fishery habitat protected from man-made despoliation." The Court cited a fisheries study prepared jointly by the state and federal government which out- lined the habitat requirements of salmon and steelhead trout and which documented the de- cline of these fish via habitat despoliation; it concluded "Were this trend to continue, the right to take fish would eventually be reduced to the right to dip one's net into the water . . . and bring it out empty."). Analogously, habitat preservation extends to the animals of the chase accorded the Blackfeet reserved rights, lest the right to hunt be reduced to the right to shoot into empty air at nonexisting animals. 484 [Vol. 6</page><page sequence="31">BLA CKFEET SACRED PLA CES These activities were conducted in a manner which maintained the opportunities to obtain game, and thus the land was protected by ne- cessity. "Land" as such cannot be bought and sold because it em- braces the people, the naahks' who compose its collective ecology. Accordingly, the Blackfeet were only surrendering their exclusive ter- ritoriality to the Badger-Two Medicine "lands" when they signed the agreement. Such an agreement, in the mind of the Blackfeet, is simi- lar to a modern lease. Traditional rights, including access "to go upon" these "lands" for religious and food-gathering purposes, were reserved unto the Blackfeet people, and these are rights of territorial- ity in a nonexclusive context. In reserving these rights, the Blackfeet did not think they were selling their sacred lands, but rather sharing them with another people. In a socio-political context, the Badger-Two Medicine area rep- resents a complex piece of history of United States governmental pol- icy and negotiation with the Blackfeet Indian Nation. The lease contention, and the reserved rights of the 1896 agreement, symbolize a sense of identity for the traditional tribal population. This value is analogous to the symbolic importance attached to Custer's defeat by other Northern Plains peoples. For contemporary Blackfeet, the Badger-Two Medicine claims assure them of status as a tribal group. Even if the government should terminate their reservation, they will forever be a tribe as long as they exercise their land claim and re- served rights to this area. In this context, these wildlands symboli- cally foster contemporary Blackfeet tribal identity and affirm the tribe's sovereignty.55 The Badger-Two Medicine represents the loss of a cherished way of life. These lands offer the alienated and the lost a way back into the traditional culture. The area consequently provides for the recovery of a sense of pride and honor in being Indian. These sacred wildlands offer a reprieve from the demoralizing effects of alcoholism, racial 55. Richmond L. Clow makes a similar point for the Sioux Nation's Black Hills land claim.

Kipp, 624 F.2d 84 (9th Cir. 1980) (wherein it was held that "Blackfeet Indians have a right to enter, without charge, that portion of Glacier National Park which at one time was within bounda- ries of the Blackfeet Indian reservation."). 455] 485</page><page sequence="32">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION abuse, and other acts of social injustice fostered by the dominant soci- ety. They have stood as a bulwark protecting traditional culture from an unsympathetic government. Spiritually, the Badger-Two Medicine is a source for the gathering of traditional Blackfeet "medicine power" and this quality has a significant role in restoring the moral fabric of the Blackfeet Nation. Accordingly, the Badger-Two Medicine is not only symbolically important, but essential to the re- covery of traditional Blackfeet culture from decades of oppression. No monetary settlement can match the gifts of dignity, tribal identity, and the assurance of sovereignty which these wildlands hold for tradi- tional Blackfeet culture. Nevertheless, the Badger-Two Medicine will buttress this traditional identity only as long as the area continues to satisfy the values of the traditional religion.56 There are two distinct but nonetheless interrelated reasons why the Forest Service has failed to communicate with and understand traditional Blackfeet religious leaders. First, who within the tribe is to be approached, honored, and respected as an authority on these matters? Second, there is an understandable reluctance on the part of religious traditionalists to inform non-Indians about their religion. In keeping with its paternalistic policy of Indian administration, the United States government has imposed a foreign governmental structure upon Indian tribes and recognized only those elected by this process as official authorities.57 This practice is both imperialistic and inconsistent with age-old tribal governmental practices. In traditional Native American societies, a leader is a leader only by honorable in- fluence. The position of chief is honorary, in keeping with respect for elders and "grandmothers" or "grandfathers." It is the chief's influ- ence rather than his power which gives him authority. There are 56. The demoralizing effects of an unsympathetic government, alcoholism, racial, abuse, and other acts of social injustice are described in McClintock, The Tragedy of the Blackfeet, Southwest Museum PAPERS, no. 3 (1970). At the risk of redundancy, the values attributed to wild nature must be affirmed as the essential claim of the traditional religion; therefore, if the traditional identity is recovered it must include the preservation of the Badger-Two Medicine wildlands. 57. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (25 U.S.C. ยงยง 461-479, 1982) generally en- couraged tribes to exercise governmental authority in several areas; this has resulted in a strong tribal presence on most reservations, but it has also created controversy. While tribal councils are recognized by the Department of the Interior, they do not always represent the traditional elements within the tribes. Disputes over leadership have emerged on several reser- vations today with the government-recognized councils challenged by "shadow" traditional governments. See generally V. DELORIA &amp; C.

This is apparent in McClin- tock's remarks concerning the sacred pipe, which is believed to have the greatest power, but also to impose the greatest burden upon the keeper. Although a burden in one sense, the sacred medicine pipe commands the greatest respect; one cannot tell a lie in its presence.58 It is traditional religious leaders, keepers of sacred medicine pipe bundles and other practicing holy men, who are the tribe's authorita- tive spokesmen with regard to sacred traditions and Blackfeet reli- gion, not officials elected by the prescriptions of a foreign and alien culture. This point was well recognized by McClintock during his study of Blackfeet culture and religion ninety years ago, and it is es- sential to understanding traditional Blackfeet religion today. On the reluctance of traditional Blackfeet religious leaders to in- form whites about their religion, consider the words of medicine man "Brings-down-the-Sun": The white race have always cheated and deceived us. They have deprived us of our country. Now they are trying to take away our religion by putting a stop to the ceremonial sacred to the Sun. Our religion was given to us by the Sun and the Moon, and we will never give it up while the Sun and Moon last. The white people have given us no good reason why they wish to take away our religion. The incident that Brings-down-the-Sun refers to involved his prepara- tion for the Sun-Dance. An Indian agent's response was to shut off his family's rations. Because of this religious persecution on behalf of the government, Brings-down-the-Sun made a solemn vow to never again deal with the white race. And he commented to McClintock, "It does not now seem to me advisable to talk further about these things, and to explain our religion to a white man."59 58.

Given the Forest Service's status as a govern- mental bureau and the history of government relations with the Blackfeet, it is not likely to fare as well as McClintock. Despite the American Religious Freedom Act of 1978 (PL 95- 341, 92 Stat. 469) which declared that "it shall be the policy of the United States to protect and preserve for the American Indians their inherent right of freedom to believe, express and exercise [their] tradi- tional religions," the U. S. Supreme Court recently ruled that the gov- ernment does not have to balance its land management practices to take into account possible adverse effects on traditional Native Ameri- can religious practices.60 The Blackfeet, however, did reserve the FEET TALES OF GLACIER, supra note 16, at 203-04 (records the belief that the presence of white people profanes their religion; but this view became prevalent only following religious persecution and Schultz (Apikuni) was specifically ask to document their traditions in writing for the benefit of Blackfeet children). 60. Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association, 485 U.S., 108 S.Ct. 1319, April 19, 1988. The Lyng case involved the Forest Service's proposal to road and log an area of the Six Rivers National Forest recognized to be of crucial religious significance to the Yurok, Karok, and Tolowa Indians. The Forest Service's consulting anthropologist concluded that alterations to the high country, such as those proposed by the Forest Service, would be "potentially destructive of the very core of Northwest [Indian] religious beliefs and practices." Writing for the majority, Ms. Justice Sandra O'Connor declared "However much we might wish that it were otherwise, government simply could not operate if it were required to satisfy every citizen's needs and desires." And further that the "Constitution does not, and the courts cannot, offer to reconcile the various competing demands on government, many of them rooted in sincere religious belief, that inevitably arise in so diverse a society as ours. That task, to the extent it is feasible, is for the legislatures and other institutions" (108 S. Ct. 1327). In dissent, Mr. Justice Brennan stated that "The Court believes that Native Americans who re- quest that the Government refrain from destroying their religion effectly seek to exact from the Government de facto, beneficial ownership of federal property." Brennan declared that the Court's reasoning produces "the cruelly surreal result" that "government action that will vir- tually destroy a religion is nevertheless deemed not to 'burden' that religion" (108 S. Ct. at 1330 and 1337). Legal scholars have been unanimous and unequivocal in rejecting the Lyng majority. Robert S. Michaelson, "Is the Miner's Canary Silent?

Furthermore, when establishing the Lewis and Clark National Forest, President Theodore Roosevelt ex- plicitly declared that that Agreement "shall be in no way infringed or modified by reason of the fact that a part of the area so relinquished is embraced within the limits of boundaries herein described and set apart as a forest reservation."61 The Blackfeet thus retain a "property interest" designed to pre- serve traditional religious practice in the Badger-Two medicine wild- lands of the Lewis and Clark National Forest. As a consequence of this provision, the Forest Service ought to be compelled to "balance" its land management practices for this area using the "least burden- some" alternative procedures required in previous first amendment cases, such as Sherbert and Yoder. The Forest Service's act of leasing the area for oil and gas exploration and development appears in viola- tion of the Forest Charter, the 1896 Agreement, and the U. S.
