<plain_text><page sequence="1">Spinoza's Use of "Idea" S. PAUL KASHAP University of California , Santa Cruz The word "idea" is used by Spinoza in so many different ways that an attempt to understand it literally in terms of his definition of an idea as "a conception of the mind which the mind forms because it is a thinking thing" (E II, Df. 3) leads to nothing but confusion. Such confusion can be and needs to be avoided by making some crucial dis- tinctions to which I wish to draw attention in this paper. Consider, for instance, Spinoza's statement, "In God there neces- sarily exists the idea of His essence, and of all things which necessarily follow from His essence." (E II, P3) Here, by "idea" he does not and cannot mean straightforwardly, "conception of the mind which the mind forms because it is a thinking thing." Spinoza's God is not a thing that thinks in the sense in which a human being is a thing that thinks. When Spinoza says, "God is a thinking thing," this means no more than what he says in the same proposition, namely, "Thought is an attribute of God." (E II, Pi) Thought constitutes the essence of God, but it is not a property ascribable to God. It would be senseless to expect Thought, an attribute, to form conceptions. What sense is to be made, then, of his statement in E II, P3? It can only mean that to say 'The essence of God consists in the attribute of thought/ is the same thing as to say Tn God there necessarily exists the idea of His essence/ And this latter must not be understood in such a way as to render God as an anthropomorphic entity believed, therefore, to have ideas which are conceptions of His mind. All it means is that Thought forms a necessary part of the nature of reality that is being referred to by the term 'substance' or 'God'. The word "idea" as it occurs in E II, P3 is to be understood, in fact, in the sense in which Spinoza uses it in E II, P4, in saying, "The idea of God, from which infinite numbers of things follow in infinite ways, can be one only." The idea of God' is the same thing, that is to say, as His essence or "the necessity of the divine nature" (E I, P16), from which infinite numbers of things are said to follow in infinite ways. As the essence of God is identical with the Attributes, Spinoza wishes to 57</page><page sequence="2">specify, by the use of the word "idea" in respect to God, reference to one of the attributes which constitute the nature of Substance- namely to Thought, and to no other. Idea' also refers to that of which the idea in an individual mind is an idea, that is to say, to a particular object of thnking, which is a concept or (in the terminology of the period) an objective idea, and which I prefer to call a 'thought-objec≈•. An 'idea' in this sense is quite indepen- dent of being thought of by any finite individual mind. This is the sense in which the word "idea" occurs in, for example, E II, P49, Dm., where Spinoza says that when the mind affirms that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles, "This affirmation involves the concept or idea ( conceptum sine ideam) of the triangle. . . .[W]ithout it the affirmation cannot be conceived." The distinction between ideas that are 'ideas in the human mind' and ideas that are 'thought-objects' is extremely important. For Spinoza, an idea is not merely something subjective, or an idea in an individual mind, but also something objec- tive. An objective idea is that of which the idea in any finite mind is an idea. It is the objective idea that it is the object of the idea in an individual mind. This may seem obscure but it is not really incom- prehensible. When a man thinks of anything, what he thinks of is an object of thought in a rather special sense. We normally say, "I am thinking of so and so," when "so and so" is a person or some spatio-temporal entity. But Spinoza wants to say that this is misleading. For when I think of "so and so," for example, a person, what I think of is the idea of a person, which is the object of thought , rather than an entity in space. Of course, the object of thought, in this instance, is itself logically related to the person. But it is not the physical entity that is directly the object of thought. The object of thought is something thinkable. It is a mode of Thought, and hence a thought-object. It does not have the characteristics of a physical body, such as weight or extension. Furthermore, because there is no such objective idea or thought- object as a square circle, a finite mind (or, for that matter, an infinite mind) cannot ever form an idea of a square circle. Contradictions cannot be thought-objects. It is the thought-objects or objective ideas which Spinoza describes as "ideas related to God." One can see why he should say "all ideas, in so far as they are related to God, are true." (EII,P32) If I say I am thinking (or trying to think) of a Euclidean triangle whose internal angles are not equal to two right angles, I am thinking of something, and whatever constitutes my idea is a mode of Thought. But the idea in my mind, whatever else it may be, cannot be the idea 58</page><page sequence="3">of a Euclidean triangle as a thought-object. Hence, the idea in my mind is bound to be inadequate. Spinoza expresses this in his terms by saying: When we say that God has this or that idea, not merely in so far as He forms the nature of the human mind, but in so far as He has at the same time with the human mind the idea also of another thing, then we say that the human mind perceives the thing partially or inadequately. (E II, Pu, C) A true idea in a human mind then, being the idea of the objective idea or thought-object, is a manifestation of the nature of God through the nature of the human mind. It is of such thought-objects again that Spinoza speaks when he says, "The knowledge of everything which happens in the object of any idea necessarily exists in God in so far as He is considered as affected with the idea of that object." (E II, P12, Dm., my italics) The word "knowledge," when used by Spinoza with reference to God, is not to be construed in the sense in which it is used with refer- ence to human beings. Why then did Spinoza use it? What is the analogy, if any, between the two which might explain Spinoza's use of "knowledge" with reference to God? This is not an easy question, but one plausible answer to it may be as follows. When I say that I have a true idea or that I possess a true idea, this is the same as saying that a true idea is in my mind or the knowledge of this idea exists in me. A true idea in my mind must be the idea of the thought-object, which is related to God insofar as the thought-object itself is a mode of the attribute of Thought. But since saying that a true idea is in my mind is the same thing as saying that the knowledge of that idea exists in me, then the thought-object which, for Spinoza, is also an 'idea' may, by analogy, be said to be the idea 'known' to God. However, the knowledge which we may thus ascribe to God is not the idea (i.e., consciousness) of the thought-object as it is ascribed to the human mind, but the thought-object itself. There is a much more complex use of the word "idea" in E II, P7. This proposition says, "The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things." This is indeed one of the most important propositions in the E thicsf and a correct interpretation and understanding of it can have crucial consequences for gaining an insight into Spinoza's philosophy of mind and action. Initially, this proposition seems to point out that logically related modes of Thought have correlative modes of Extension that are causally related to each other. The term 'idea' in the proposition itself does not 59</page><page sequence="4">appear to refer to 'conceptions' of any particular mind, or to ideas in any human mind, but to modes of Thought as thought-objects. Spinoza might as well have expressed the proposition by saying, "The order and connection of modes of Thought is the same as the order and con- nection of modes of Extension." But this is not all that he has in mind. What he means to say further is that whether we human beings conceive the world as a thought-object or as a part of the spatio-temporal order, we shall discover, if our conception is true, one and the same order of explanation, and sequence of things. Take the example of a circle. It will be agreed that in order to entertain a true conception of the circle, one must understand why a figure is a circle rather than anything else. One must, in other words, have a grasp of the conditions that determine the conception one has, to be the conception of a circle. It will also be agreed that if a circle exists in nature, say a circle drawn on paper, it must necessarily embody all the conditions which go to make it a circle. The conditions for the existence of a circle in nature are also those which must be compre- hended in the conception we form of a circle if it is to be a true conception. These conditions are numerically identical (although qualitatively distinct). They must, that is to say, exist in nature, and our thinking (ideas) must involve ideas (thought-objects) of those very conditions, in order for us to have a true idea or concept of a circle. These are not two different sets of conditions. Spinoza expresses this by saying that a mode of extension (a circle existing in nature) and the idea of that mode (the thought-object correlative to it), are one and the same thing expressed in two different ways. "The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things." The very conditions which would explain the existence of things in the spatio-temporal order are the conditions that will have to be incor- porated in the thought-objects of those things in order for our thoughts to be true thoughts of those particular things. Therefore, to put it in Spinoza's terms, whether we view the world under the attribute of extension, or under the attribute of thought, or under any other attri- butes whatever, we shall discover one and the same order, one and the same connection of causal relations, one and the same set of explanatory conditions. (E II, P7, S) The term 'idea' is used by Spinoza also to refer to what we normally describe as fictions of the mind or imaginations, which would include dreams. These are what he calls "ideas of non-existent individual things." (E II, P8) The notion of 'non-existent individual things' would also include things that may be said to be possible and/or in the future as well as those that existed in the past.1 60</page><page sequence="5">'Idea' is also sometimes used as "the idea of individual things actually existing." (E II, P9) In this sense 'idea' refers to (1) sense perception of objects as part of the common order of nature; ( 2 ) memories of such objects; and (3) conceptions (as distinct from perceptions) of things, either as part of the common order of nature, or as part of the order of intellect, without the aid of direct perception or memory of them. This last use of the word 'idea' is significant in Spinoza, for it is ideas taken in this sense that Spinoza seems to regard as 'adequate' as well as 'true'. If we remember Spinoza's example, in E II, P7, S, for instance, of a circle existing in nature and the idea that is in God of an existing circle which, he says, are one and the same thing manifested through different attributes; and if one takes the phrase "idea that is in God" to refer to the thought-object or the objective idea, then one can perhaps follow what Spinoza means by the following statement: Whatever happens in the object of the idea constituting the human mind must be perceived by the human mind; or in other words, an idea of that thing will necessarily exist in the human mind. That is to say, if the object of the idea constituting the human mind be a body, nothing can happen in that body which is not perceived by the mind. (E II, P12) Spinoza seems to be saying that whatever constitutes the thought-object of, for instance, a circle, must be included in the conception that I form of a circle in order for the idea of a circle in my mind to be true. Because the thought-object corresponding to the idea in my mind is the thought-object correlative to the mode of extension, namely a circle existing in nature (which is a body), it is inconceivable that there be anything which constitutes the nature of that body but is not included in my true idea of it. The order and connecton of ideas being the same as the order and connection of things, it is in principle impossible that the idea of a thing in my mind be true and yet fail to reflect the connec- tons constituting the thought-object correlated with the nature of the thing as it is. The word "object" in phrases such as "the object of the idea" (E II, P12 and 13), has two senses, which are correlative but distinct. In one sense, as noted above, it means the 'objective idea' or 'thought- object/ which is also said to be an idea 'existing in Goƒè or 'in the infinite intellect of God." In another sense, it refers not to the mode of Thought but to the mode of Extension correlated with the thought- object. To conceive a thought-object is to have an idea in one's mind. 61</page><page sequence="6">But to have an idea is also at times to perceive the mode of Extension of which the objective idea is an idea. Suppose a primitive man or a child looks at a circle drawn on paper, but does not know the conditions that explain its nature. He does not know, in Spinoza's terms, the 'definition' of a circle. Assuming normal eyesight, he would see the figure of a circle as would another man who understands the nature or definition of a circle. The visual object in both cases is the same, but the conceptual object differs. In both cases, however, the sense perception of the circle consists of the ideas (of sense perception) of the way in which their respective bodies (eyes and brain) are affected by an object in space and time (the circle drawn on paper). Spinoza's view seems to be that the objective idea or thought-object of the circle, as it is in nature, remains unchanged. For the thought-object is, in a sense, nothing but that which can be (although in fact may not be) an object of an idea in an individual mind. When an individual mind does conceive this object, his idea of the circle is a true idea. A man may, of course, have a false idea of the circle. A false idea is an idea in a mind which is not the idea of the thought-object correlated with the actual circle, but the idea of a thought-object correlated with the circle as merely perceived by the senses- the circle as it exists in 'imagination', as Spinoza would say. A false idea, therefore, being the idea of a thought-object of a superficial aspect of the circle, would fail to be the idea of the thought-object correlated with the circle as it is. A false idea is, therefore, an inadequate idea by failing to be the idea of the thought-object of a thing as it is in its nature. This is what Spinoza tries to convey when he says, "Falsity consists in the privation of knowledge which inadequate ideas involve." (E II, P35 ) To be in error is not the same thing, to Spinoza, as to be ignorant. For in the case of ignorance, there clearly can be no thought-object involved what- soever. The primitive man in our example does not suffer from absolute ignorance, for he does perceive the circle, but he does not conceive the thought-object correlated with the nature of the circle. Spinoza might want to add that what the primitive man fails to conceive is not some- thing which depends for its existence upon his nature. For even if there were no human beings to form an idea of the thought-object correlated with a circle existing in nature, it would still remain a mode of Thought -something conceivable in itself- "an idea in God's mind." We have observed that Spinoza uses the word "idea" to refer to the "thought-object" as distinct from the "idea in the human mind." There are, furthermore, two kinds of thought-objects: (1) those which are correlated with the modifications of my body as affected by external 62</page><page sequence="7">bodies (the ideas of these thought-objects constitute my perceptual consciousness of the external world); and (2) thought-objects which are correlated with the nature of external bodies as they are, without affecting my body. Spinoza's contention seems to be that it is only when ideas in an individual mind are ideas of thought-objects correlated with the nature of external bodes as they are, that an individual can be said to have true ideas. The expression 'true idea' also refers to two different things. It can refer ( 1 ) to the thought-object correlated with the nature of an external body independently of being an idea in any finite mind; and (2) to the idea in a √±nite mind f which is the idea of the thought-object correlated with the nature of the external body. When Spinoza says in his essay On the Improvement of the Understanding ( TdlE , Boyle, VI. 33), "A true idea is something different from its correlate; thus a circle is differ- ent from the idea of a circle," the word "idea," it seems to me, refers to the thought-object rather than to the idea in a human mind. He explains that "the idea of a circle is not something having a circum- ference and a centre, as a circle has; nor is the idea of a body that body itself." ( TdlEy Boyle, VI. 33) Because the thought-object is something different from its correlative body, it is capable of being understood through itself. Spinoza explains himself further with an example. The man Peter is something real. The true idea of Peter is the reality of Peter represented as an objective mode of thought and is itself some- thing real and quite distinct from the spatio-temporal Peter. "Now as this true idea of Peter is in itself something real, and has its own individual existence, it will also be capable of being understood-that is, of being the subject of another idea (idea in a human mind) which will contain by representation all that the idea (the thought-object) of Peter contains actually." (Tdl E, Boyle, VI. 33, parenthetical inserts mine) From this it would seem to follow that since my perception of my body (as existing) consists of ideas of the thought-objects correlated with my body as a spatio-temporal entity, it is in principle impossible that my idea of its existence not be a true idea. Consequently, as Spinoza says, "The human body exists as we perceive it." (E II, Pi 3, C) Furthermore, if my perception of objects in the external world consists of ideas in my mind of thought-objects, correlated with affections of my body causally connected with the external body, then, it is impossible for any idea in my mind which constitutes veridical perception to be an instance of false knowledge. An account of Spinoza's view of 'error' would further clarify his con- ception of 'true idea'. There is a distinction between the idea a man, 63</page><page sequence="8">say Peter, has of his own existence (consisting of ideas of thought- objects correlated with the affections of his own body), and the idea of Peter's existence that another man, say Paul, has (which are ideas of the thought-objects correlated with Paul's body). It is possible for Paul to have ideas of thought-objects correlated with the nature of his own body, and believe Peter to exist even if Peter in fact does not exist In other words, Paul can have ideas representing Peter as an externally existing entity, even when Peter does not exist. But it is in principle impossible for Peter to have ideas of the affections of his own body, unless there is a body whose affections are correlated with thought- objects whose ideas constitute Peter's mind. So that, although Paul can perceive Peter when Peter exists, and can also imagine that he exists when he does not, it is impossible for Peter to perceive or imagine his own body when it does not exist. So long as Paul merely imagines Peter to exist (when he does not or no longer does ) , Paul is not making any error. But he will be in error if on the basis of his idea, he believes that Peter not only exists as an idea of his imagination, but also exists as a spatio-temporal entity. For then Paul's mind, in not having an idea of the thought-object correlated with the nonexistence of Peter's body, entertains a false idea of Peter's existence. This is what Spinoza means, I believe, when he refers to Paul in the above example and observes, "These imaginations of the mind regarded by themselves contain no error, and . . . the mind is not in error because it imagines, but only in so far as it is considered as wanting in an idea which excludes the existence of those things which it imagines as present." (E II, P17, S) "There is something real in the ideas themselves," Spinoza says, "whereby the true are distinguished from the false." ( TdlE , Boyle, IX. 70) This 'reality' must belong, clearly, to ideas as thought-objects rather than to ideas as constituting the human mind. For, as Spinoza points out, "If an architect conceives a building properly constructed, even if such a building may never have existed, and may never exist, nevertheless the idea is true; and the idea remains the same whether it be put into execution or not." (TdlE, Boyle, IX. 69) If one considers the above two statements together, then not only is the architect's idea true whether the building is built or not, but the idea is also true, whether he continues to think it or not. What makes the architect's idea true is the nature of the idea as a thought- object, and not the fact that it exists as a thought in his mind. A man's perception, then, of external bodies can only occur through ideas correlated with the affections of his body. To perceive an external body as actually existing is not the same as imagining it to exist, in the sense in which Paul imagined Peter's body to exist when in fact it did 64</page><page sequence="9">not. It is only insofar as the mind imagines external bodies in the above sense, that it does not possess a true idea of them. (E II, P26, Dm) It is important to remember that Spinoza is not rejecting all knowledge derived from sense perception as false. The demonstration of E II, P26 says, "When the human mind through the ideas of the affections of its body contemplates external bodies, we say that it then imagines." Spinoza refers here to E II, P17, S, where, in explaining his use of the term 'imagine', he says: We will give to those affections of the human body, the ideas of of which represent to us external bodies as if they were present, the name of images of things , although they do not actually reproduce the forms of the things. When the mind contemplates bodies in this way, we will say that it imagines. And if this is what 'imagining' means, then he is, of course, correct in saying that, "So far as the mind imagines external bodies it does not possess an, adequate knowledge of them." (E II, P26, Dm) There is one other point Spinoza discusses in TdlE that is of interest here. We may all agree that if on the basis of the ideas of his imagina- tion Paul believes Peter to exist (when in fact Peter does not), then he is entertaining a false belief. Spinoza, however, goes further; he sug- gests that if Paul made a statement asserting the existence of Peter, without knowing whether Peter in fact did or did not exist, then Paul's statement, so far as Paul himself is concerned, is false, even if Peter did exist. For, Spinoza says, "The assertion that Peter exists is true only with regard to him who knows for certain that Peter does exist." (Tdl E, Boyle, IX. 69) Does Spinoza mean that Paul's statement is false because Paul does not have the evidence required for his statement to be true? If this is what he means, then he may be implying a distinc- tion between merely asserting or making a statement, and believing something, or entertaining or having an idea. Perhaps Spinoza has in mind that just as one may entertain an idea or believe a proposition without stating it, one may also state or assert a proposition without believing it.2 The grounds for the falsity of belief then may not be the grounds for the falsity of the statement. Another example he gives would tend to support this reading. "When I heard a man lately com- plaining that his court had flown into one of his neighbors's fowls," says Spinoza, "I understood what he meant and therefore did not imagine him to be in error." (E II, P47, S) He is suggesting that although the man's statement was false, there was no error in his belief. There is little doubt that he does have this distinction in mind, but it is not likely that this is all that he means. I think that he further 65</page><page sequence="10">means that the grounds which make a belief true (or a true idea) are also the grounds which make the statement of those beliefs true state- ments. For if Spinoza were asked, "What does it mean for someone to know for certain that an idea is true?", he would have to say that an idea of Peter in my mind is true if it is the idea of the thought-object corre- lated with the actual existence or non-existence of Peter. The man who asserts that Peter exists without knowing it for certain, makes a state- ment which is not evidentially but only accidentally related to (the thought-object of) Peter's actual existence. So that although what is asserted or stated (namely a proposition) taken in itself is true, yet the man who asserted it did not have in his mind the idea of the appropriate correlative thought-object. It is the lack or absence of any evidentially appropriate relation between the idea in the man's mind and the thought-object correlated with Peter's existence which explains the falsity of his statement. It is also the lack of an evidentially appropriate relation between what Paul imagines and the thought-object correlated with Peter's nonexistence that makes Paul's belief a false belief. It is not generally understood that there is a difference in Spinoza's thought between the inadequacy, or uncertainty of an idea and its falsity, and likewise between its adequacy and its truth. In E II, P29, C, Spinoza states that the human mind, when it perceives things in the common order of nature, has no adequate knowledge of external bodies, but only a confused and mutilated (or inadequate) knowledge. He holds, furthermore, that the human mind perceives external bodies as actually existing only through the ideas of the affections of its body. (E II, P26) This, however, does not amount to saying that whenever we perceive external bodies as actually existing we are involved in making an error. Error or false knowledge consists in the absence of that certainty which is the defining characteristic of an adequate idea, and this certainty is more than a mere psychological certainty. For it is quite common for a person to feel psychologically certain and yet entertain a false idea. The criterion for the adequacy of an idea given by Spinoza is that it be one which, considered in itself, without reference to an external object, has all the properties or internal signs of a true idea. (E II, Df. 4) The notion of the adequacy of an idea in Spinoza's thought seems to exclude all reference to the agreement of the idea with an object, so that the certainty that is involved in having an adequate idea is not based upon the negative criterion of absence of doubt, or grounds for doubt (E II, P49, S ) , but on the positive criterion of 'seeing' its truth to be undeniable on any grounds. (E II, P43 and S) Therefore, on the grounds of its internal self-consistency, an adequate 66</page><page sequence="11">idea must be a true idea. It is this kind of adequate idea or knowledge, which is necessarily true, that belongs to what Spinoza describes as Reason and Intuition. Indeed, he also says (as noted earlier), that the human body exists as we perceive it (E II, Pi 3, C), in spite of the fact that our perception of it from the common order of nature is inade- quate. Spinoza could not, and does not, however, mean by this that his knowledge of the existence of the human body derived from sense perception is false. It may, of course, be a case of inadequate knowledge. For while he does say (E II, P41 ) that falsity or error occurs only at the level of the first kind of knowledge, namely 'opinion or imagination'- which must include sense perception- it does not follow that all knowl- edge at this level is necessarily false. Imagination and perception by themselves, he tells us, contain no error or falsity (E II, P17, S), but rather falsity or error arises when one assents to, asserts, or believes in the existence of what one merely imagines or perceives to be the case, without having excluded all those ideas which might lead one to believe something on inadequate and inappropriate evidence. Spinoza's thought may perhaps be expressed as follows. From the fact that one has an adequate idea, it follows that one must also have a feeling of certainty about its truth. From the fact, howeevr, that one feels certain, it does not follow that the idea which is entertained is an adequate idea. In every case of a person's entertaining a true idea, he must also feel certain about its truth. Yet this certainty may be a consequence of having the evidence required for the idea to be true, and this evidence may involve reference to something other than or external to the idea itself. But a true idea is an adequate idea only if its certainty does not require any reference to an object other than the idea itself. Perhaps this was the distinction Spinoza wished to draw when he wrote to Tschirnhaus (E p. 60), "I recognize no other difference between a true and an adequate idea than that the word true refers to the agreement of the idea with its ideatum, while the word adequate refers to the nature of the idea itself." If this is the distinction he is making, then Spinoza would appear to hold that an idea may be true even though it may not be adequate. This would explain the assertion that the human body does exist as we perceive it. Nothing in Spinoza's discussion of inade- quate knowledge gives the reader any grounds for believing that Spinoza was dismissing the external world, or our veridical perception of it, as a mere illusion. To perceive things truly, that is to say, to have ideas which are ideas of thought-objects correlated with the nature and constitution of things as they are in themselves, is to have rational knowledge. Rational 67</page><page sequence="12">knowledge, or 'knowledge in accordance with reason/ consists precisely in 'seeing/ grasping, or understanding the necessary relation between ideas in one's own mind and thought-objects correlated with the nature of things as they are. This is what Spinoza means, when he says, "It is of the nature of reason to consider things as necessary and not as con- tingent. This necessity of things it perceives truly; that is to say, as it is in itself." (E II, P44, Dm) And to perceive things truly, he points out, is to have an idea which agrees with that of which it is an idea. (E I, A6) The necessity of this relation between a true idea in a mind and the thought-object is the same as the necessity of the divine nature of God, referred to earlier in E I, P16, Dm. It is, he is suggesting, the nature of the universe, and of the nature of the principle of its origin, that to know things truly is to know the necessary relation between ideas in one's mind and the thought-objects correlative to things in the world. The foundation of rational knowledge is that a human being knows with certainty that he has a body and that he has ideas, or is conscious. As all ideas in the human mind are ideas of the affections of the body (that is, ideas of thought-objects correlated with changes occurring in the body ) , it is in principle impossible that a man be conscious of these ideas ( or have ideas of ideas ) , without the correlative changes occurring in his body. Hence, in being conscious of having ideas, or in being self- conscious, he is necessarily affirming not merely the existence of ideas, but also the existence of his body. His body is only one mode of exten- sion among infinite others, all of which are equally extended objects. The fact that we know objects as extended logically implies that Exten- sion is an attribute forming a necessary part of the nature of our knowl- edge of the universe. It is not merely a category under which we perceive bodies; it must also form part of the nature of the principle of origin of the universe, by reference to which alone it can be explained why certain things are bodies, rather than anything else. The knowledge a human mind has of bodies, not as this or that partic- ular body, but as modes of Extension, and of ideas as modes of Thought, is knowledge that cannot be false and hence is adequate knowledge. It belongs to the category of 'common notions' in the sense that I, in having a body, also know those common properties (of Extension) which form the essential character of other bodies. It is by having this common nature that my body is both capable of being, and in fact is, affected by other bodies, the ideas of whose thought-objects constitute my mind. What makes 'common notions' true, however, is not just the fact that their ideas are present in a human mind. Common notions refer to "things which are common to everything" (E II, P 38), as well 68</page><page sequence="13">as to their correlated thought-objects. It is the ideas of these thought- objects which constitute adequate ideas in a man's mind. Because the nature of natura naturans, the 'source' or 'origin', the primal reality, is such that the universe as its manifestation, natura naturata , is constituted the way it is, therefore , the intellect perceives the nature of that reality by experiencing the world under two distinct categories of Thought and Extension. My knowledge of the world, as consisting of physical objects and thought-objects, constitutes ideas which cannot but be adequate and true; for these ideas are logically related to the thought-objects of which they are ideas. Because it is impossible that an effect can follow if there be no determinate condition or explanation for it (E I, A3), the ideas we have in our minds are effects whose nature can be understood only in terms of the conditions that explain them. When we know these conditions as they are, and the necessity of their relation to the ideas in our mind, it is logically impossi- ble that our knowledge of these universal conditions be inadequate or false. Once we have an initial idea that is adequate and true, then other ideas logically related to them will have to be ideas of thought- objects reflecting the causal relations between correlated modes of extension. These common notions, and other ideas logically related to them, are thought-objects of things as they are in themselves. They do not pertain to the nature of any one given individual, but to the nature of all things considered under a given category. In this sense, common notions, being thought-objects correlated with the actual nature of the universe, and to actual properties of things in the universe without reference to any time or place, are universally true notions.3 If someone were to ask now, "How can one be certain that the ideas one has are not merely true but also adequate?", Spinoza would answer: if one is asking for a criterion to determine the adequacy of ideas, which is separate from the ideas in question, then there can be no other criteria to establish it except these ideas themselves. They are adequate and true for the simple reason that, being ideas of thought-objects cor- related with the actual nature of things, they could not (logically) be false or inadequate. They are their own criteria of truth. Their logical certainty is also the ground for their psychological certainty. Hence, "He who has a true idea knows at the same time that he has a true idea, nor can he doubt the truth of the thing." (E II, P43) By 'true idea' here, Spinoza must mean an idea which is at once adequate and true. Thus I have tried to show how a much more coherent picture of Spinoza's theory of knowledge begins to emerge in light of the recogni- tion of the distinctions drawn in this paper, as to Spinoza's use of 'idea' than would be possible if they were ignored. 69</page><page sequence="14">NOTES i. I am indebted to Bruce Kermott for the contents of this last sentence. Ker- mott pointed out that ideas of things that do not yet exist, are not the same as ideas of things that do; and an idea of a thing that once existed but does not any longer, is not the same as an idea of a thing that is still existent. An idea of a person who is alive is one thing; an idea of him when he is no longer alive, quite another. Although both may be described as 'rememberings', to confuse one with the other would lead to false knowledge. Spinoza's examples of Peter and Paul (see pp. 65-66) would appear to suggest this distinction. 2. I might, for instance, entertain various thoughts, beliefs (i.e., ideas) about, say, immortality or life after death without stating (uttering or writing) them. I might also utter the sentence and thereby state that "the chair I am sitting on is on fire," without believing that the chair is in fact on fire. Or, I might simply make a verbal mistake in the course of making a statement of my belief. 3. A corollary of this would be that two individual minds entertaining such universal ideas cannot but agree with each other. The question of difference of opinion among them about the truth of these ideas cannot (logically) arise. 70</page></plain_text>
