<plain_text><page sequence="1">faith and its fulfillment: agency, exchange, and the Fijian aesthetics of completion HIROKAZU MIYAZAKI Northwestern University In this article, I develop a theory of what I call the abeyance of agency, draw- ing upon a comparison between Fijian Christian church and gift-giving ritu- als. I argue that from religious practitioners' viewpoint, religious faith con- cerns not so much the intentions of an anthropomorphic Godas the limits that are temporarily placed on ritual participants' agency. Such abeyance and subsequent recovery of their agency enables them to experience the intima- tions of an ultimate response. [agency, form, temporality, gift exchange, Christianity, Fiji] In response to the centrality of the concept of agency in current social theory (Giddens 1979; cf. Dirks et al. 1994; Greenhouse 1996; Ortner 1984; Strathern 1988:268-274) and recent attention to the dialectical constitution of local and global agents (e.g., Comaroff and Comaroff 1991:9), Webb Keane (1997a, 1997b) and oth- ers (e.g., Ortner 1997) recently have suggested that more attention be paid to forms of agency that do not necessarily privilege the autonomy of human agents. In confront- ing such conceptions of non-human agency, however, anthropologists have faced a variety of descriptive difficulties. The descriptive challenge for a social scientist presented with conceptions of ex- perientially inaccessible entities (gods, spirits, etc.) involves an act of translation. In his discussion of "the problems a secular subject like history faces in handling imagi- nations in which gods, spirits, or the supernatural have agency in the world," the his- torian Dipesh Chakrabarty has noted: "We have two systems of thought, one in which the world is ultimately, that is, in the final analysis, disenchanted, and the other in which the humans are not the only meaningful agents. For the purpose of writing his- tory, the first system, the secular, translates the second into itself" (1997:35, emphasis in original). Chakrabarty comments that anthropologists have attempted such transla- tions by placing the objects of others' religious devotion into social and political con- text. For example, in the social scientific imagination, these entities may be contextu- alized as a reflection of a certain structure of social organization (Durkheim 1965[1915]). They may constitute a tool for the maintenance of hierarchy (Bloch 1989). Or they may be understood as part of a "system of symbols" (Geertz 1973:90) that compels ritual participants to embrace certain moral orientations. One approach that has taken seriously the descriptive difficulties entailed in un- derstanding religious practitioners' imagination of experientially inaccessible entities has focused on language use and language ideology. This approach has followed Kenneth Burke's classical rendering of theology as "preeminently verbal" and "words about 'God' " (1961 :vi, emphasis removed), and his accompanying proposal to study "the nature of religion as a rhetoric, as persuasiveness" (1961 :vi). It has considered the American Ethnologist 27(1 ):31-51. Copyright ? 2000, American Anthropological Association.</page><page sequence="2">american ethnologist question of the relationship between the "claim to and exercise of legitimate religious authority" and the "effective management of words" (Bauman 1983:35; cf. Besnier 1995:140-168; Parkin 1985). More recent studies in this genre have focused not only on actors' language use but also on their conceptions of the limits and possibilities of language in accessing experientially inaccessible entities (e.g., Bowen 1993:77-105; Coleman 1996; Hanks 1996:175; Keane 1994, 1997a, 1997c; see Keane 1997b). For example, contemporary American televangelists and their followers understand the very act of listening and speaking to be evidence of "believing" (Harding 1987:179), while 17th-century Quakers resorted to silence to experience the divine agent (Bau- man 1983; cf. Maltz 1985). Implicit in these language-centered studies is an assumption that religious practi- tioners and anthropologists share a singular problem, that is, the problem of how to render what is experientially inaccessible accessible, as Max Muller once put it in his definition of religion as "a struggle to conceive the inconceivable, to utter the unutter- able, a longing after the Infinite" (quoted in Durkheim 1965[1915]:39). The subjects of anthropological inquiry, however, may not share the social scientist's problem of how to render experientially inaccessible entities accessible. Religious practitioners may even explicitly reject an anthropomorphic rendering of non-human entities to in- sist that what is at issue is not so much the agency of these entities as the limits of hu- man agency-their own or others. In other words, what makes religious rituals conse- quential is not the intentions of experientially inaccessible entities from religious practitioners' viewpoint but the limits placed, at least temporarily, on their own ca- pacity to make sense of events or even their capacity to act. In this article, I discuss an instance I call the abeyance of agency in one commu- nity of Fijian Methodists and Seventh-day Adventists. Instead of examining how relig- ious practitioners render experientially inaccessible entities accessible, I attempt to understand the imagination of these entities as an effort to place limits on the imagi- ner's own agency. Seen from this perspective, faith emerges not so much as a Kierkegaardian leap of belief in something beyond comprehension but as a capacity to place one's agency in abeyance. A comparison of a range of rituals performed by Fijian Christians will bring this definition of faith into focus. questions and answers The Fijian village of Suvavou is located on the outskirts of Fiji's capital city of Suva.1 In Suvavou, two Christian churches, Methodist and Seventh-day Adventist (SDA), have coexisted for over a hundred years since the chief of Suvavou became Adventist in 1898.2 The two churches offer villagers very different models of social life (see Thomas 1997:50-51, 224; cf. Chowning 1990): At the most obvious level, Meth- odists observe the Sabbath on Sunday, while the Adventist Sabbath begins at sunset on Friday and ends at sunset on Saturday. Many Adventists abstain from cooking on the Sabbath and spend most of the day attending church services. In contrast, for Methodists Sunday lunch is the most elaborate meal of the week. Adventists adhere to many food prohibitions, such as those against eating pork and shellfish, and are highly conscious of following a healthy diet. Methodists, on the other hand, observe none of these prohibitions. Yaqona (piper methysticum or kava) drinking is an integral part of Methodist gatherings, while Adventists do not drink yaqona, alcohol, or even tea (see Steley 1990:209-210; cf. SDA General Conference 1988:282). The organizational structures of the two churches are very different, also. The Methodist Church in Fiji and Rotuma is a self-contained national body internally separated into "divisions" (wasewase) and "circuits" (tabacakacaka). Members of the 32</page><page sequence="3">faith and its fulfillment Methodist Church are constantly reminded in sermons and church activities of being part of a national church structure with the President (Qase Levu, lit. "Big Elder") at its apex. In contrast, Adventists stress their membership in a worldwide community of Sabbath keepers who every Saturday study the same section of the same textbook pro- duced at the world headquarters of the SDA Church in the United States. At the Suva- vou Methodist Church, only Fijian preachers preach, and they do so in Fijian. At the Suvavou SDA Church, European, Tongan, and Samoan preachers, in addition to Fiji- ans, give sermons. Many non-Fijian preachers deliver their sermons in English while Fijian Adventist school teachers translate these sermons into Fijian almost simultane- ously. Finally, the Methodist church leadership has played a central role in nationalist politics, and church activities are steeped in commentary on Fijian cultural identity. In contrast, Adventists do not portray their church as exclusively and independently Fijian and do not regard the church as a forum for the explicit celebration of Fijian ethnicity and its relationship to Christian faith. The doctrinal and organizational differences between the two churches are sometimes the subject of "joking debates" between cross-cousins (tavale) which An- dew Arno has also observed in the Lau Islands (1990). For example, on New Year's Eve 1995, following the annual joint church services held successively at the SDA and Methodist churches in the village, Ana, a Methodist, and her cross-cousin, Jo, an Adventist, held such a joking debate while Ana's husband, daughter, and I chatted outside Ana's house. The debate began when Jo told of his experiences working as a cook at a resort hotel near the village. In the course of the story, he mentioned that he had served pork and shellfish to the passengers of a cruise ship. Ana jokingly chal- lenged him to justify serving to other people what he himself was not allowed to eat. Jo responded that it was what tourists wanted. Ana's husband, Sikeli, joined in as a mediator to repeat Jo's response. Ana then asked if it was a sin for him to serve to oth- ers what he himself would not eat. Sikeli repeated Ana's question and asked how Jo would respond. Jo quickly countered with a quotation from the Bible that one must give others what they need. This response provoked appreciative laughter from all of us. Jo also added that he did not touch the pork and shellfish, as non-SDA women pre- pared those items. Ana's daughter then shouted, "You ate them, too!" and we all burst into laughter. As Donald Brenneis has noted of pancayat, or conflict resolution sessions among Fiji Indians, a Fijian joking debate concerns "more than its topic, for aesthetic pleas- ure, or pleasure expressed in aesthetic terms, is central to it" (1990:230). In this inter- change, a conflict over religious doctrine provided the basis for a particular kind of social engagement. It was the quick rhythm of the engagement, the sequence of chal- lenges (in the form of questions) and responses (in the form of answers) that captured our attention and entertained (cf. Arno 1990:264). An exchange of questions and answers between two sides is also a predominant manner of religious learning at both Methodist and SDA churches. Every Sunday morning, for example, when Methodist villagers gather together for their Sunday church service, a group of old women seated in the back pews of the church reads aloud in a rather monotonous tone a set of questions and answers in an exercise known as "singing questions" (laga taro). These questions and answers concern Meth- odists' fundamental beliefs and are printed at the back of the Methodist Church hymn book. With a measured cadence, the leader of the group reads aloud the question, such as "Is it possible for the Holy Spirit to descend to us?" and the rest of the group reads aloud the answer: "It is possible as Peter said on Pentecost Sunday: 'Each one of you must turn away from your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, so that 33</page><page sequence="4">american ethnologist your sins will be forgiven; and you will receive God's gift, the Holy Spirit' (Acts 2:38-39)" (Methodist Church in Fiji 1988[1938]:439). Unlike the joking debate between cross cousins, this exchange scripts both the questions and the answers, and all that is required is to read them in unison as printed in the hymn book. As church members arrive at church and take seats, the monotone back-and-forth of question and answer serves as a kind of background music or rhythm that fills the few minutes before the opening of the worship. Even more than the joking debate, Methodist women's practice of singing questions focuses not so much on the content of the question and answer pairs as on the rhythm that these sets produce. Although it is less predetermined than Methodist women's singing questions, there is a similar pattern of questions and answers in the Adventist religious service. Every Saturday morning, Adventist villagers assemble at their church to attend Sab- bath School.3 Bible study groups, known as "classes" (kalasi), are organized accord- ing to age and sex. Teachers are senior male church members. In their classes, women and young people generally keep quiet and defer to the group leader. In con- trast, in the male elders' classes, members take turns each week serving as teacher, and the teacher's authority is limited to asking the first question and directing the con- versation at particular moments. Male elders' classes often involve heated debate as participants openly disagree with one another's interpretations of the Bible. One of the interesting features of these conversations is that the teacher does not aim to demonstrate his authority (cf. Goody 1978:42). Rather, members of the elders' classes take turns leading the discussion by asking a question. The form of interaction among male elders consists in sets of discussions, each focusing on a particular ques- tion. One elder asks a question of the others, and each of the others attempts to formu- late an answer in turn. Consider the following discussion in one male elder's class of the role working for the church plays in salvation. Referring to a passage from Luke (23:40-43), in which one of the two men crucified with Jesus cried out, "Remember me, Jesus, when you come as King," to which Jesus responded, "I promise you that today you will be in Paradise with me," Sakeasi asked, how could the sinner be saved simply by asking for salvation without having done any work for God in his lifetime. The designated teacher responded: I think that he knew this was the end of his life.... He believed that this was Christ, the Savior.... So he believed. But this demonstrates how God will accept us when we change. What do you think? If there is another "chance" [English word] for this man, I believe it is possible for him to take up that chance. Disregarding the teacher's answer as irrelevant, Sakeasi repeated the question. After another member made a comment that Sakeasi again rejected, the latter once again repeated his question, and the teacher again attempted to respond. Yet again, Sakeasi was not satisfied. He reminded members of the discussion group of the significance of the question and asked them to try to listen to what the Holy Spirit might say to them on this point: "This is a good question because sometimes we are lazy and suddenly someone asks us and we are confused. We should give some thought to its answer. The Holy Spirit can give us what we should talk about." Then, the teacher and another member of the class, again responded. Both seized on Sakeasi's mentioning the Holy Spirit's illumination and projected this insight into an understanding of the sinner's be- havior. Unsatisfied with these answers, Sakeasi finally gave his own answer to his question: 34</page><page sequence="5">faith and its fulfillment I now would like to present my own thoughts. Who was nailed to the cross along with the sinners? Jesus. Jesus decides everything that we follow now .... It is said that even if your sin is serious, confess it and you will be in heaven. He confessed and is in heaven.... You believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.... Do not tithe this week if you have trouble today.... God is watching and it is possible for you to be in trouble and not to tithe but to tithe next week. If you die suddenly, God knows that you did not tithe be- cause you had trouble, which is not a serious matter. If one does not do any work ... He will wait for you to tithe. This answer then prompted others to confirm Sakeasi's answer as correct by each re- citing language from the Bible that would support his point in turn. For example, one member of the class offered the following quotation from the Bible and the Sabbath School textbook: "Colossians 2:6: 'Since you have accepted Christ Jesus as Lord, live in union with him.' It is interpreted as follows: 'To follow Jesus requires wholehearted conversion at the start, and a repetition of this conversion every day' " (quoted in Gane 1995:64, taken from SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1113). Although rounds of questions and answers begin as contests among elders, as the above example illustrates, the person who asks the question usually concludes the round of answers by providing his own answer. Once the proper answer has been found, the other participants then offer further confirmation of the correctness and fi- nality of that answer by citing Bible passages that support the answer (cf. Hayden 1987). If Methodist women's practice of singing questions achieves a sense of com- pletion through the chanting of printed sets of questions and answers, Adventists' Sab- bath School sessions achieve it through an exchange of questions and answers be- tween class members. The above example also draws attention to the fact that for Adventists, asking a question is an extremely significant move. Praising two other members of the class for asking good questions, Sakeasi stated: We know that we believe in Jesus as God's son but very often we are too shy to show in a straight way, and to ask in a straight way, what troubles us. ... Very often it is dif- ficult for me to talk in a straight manner to a pastor or a lay preacher. The Holy Spirit inspires ... us so that we get to something. Let us not be too shy to ask in a straight manner following the path indicated by Jesus. If we follow this path, we ask [right questions] but some other times the Devil tries hard to crush our thought.... Shyness is the weapon of the Devil that makes one's mind small and that tells us not to show in a straight manner what worries us or what makes it possible for us to obtain eternal life. Although Bible study sessions always begin with a prayer for the Holy Spirit's guid- ance, and participants often refer to the Holy Spirit's guidance during the course of their debate (as Sakeasi did at one point in the above example), the issue of the agency of the Holy Spirit in "speaking through" the participants (see Bauman 1989[1974]; Harding 1987) was secondary. In Sakeasi's theory of questions and answers, what was crucial, rather, was one's attitude, one's "straight manner." Shyness, evidenced by re- luctance to ask, prevented a person from grasping the Holy Spirit's enlightenment. In other words, asking a question not only evidenced one's straight manner but also guaranteed one's capacity to reach the right answer. problems and solutions In Methodist and Adventist church sermons, there is a similar rhetorical pattern. Like questions and answers in Bible study sessions, both Methodist and Adventist preachers' sermons consist of a contingent set of paired problems and solutions. In 35</page><page sequence="6">american ethnologist this pattern, the preacher urges the congregation to realize the problematic nature of the present way of worship and to seek a solution. In other words, the preacher se- quentially formulates and then solves problems concerning the congregation's way of life. Methodist and Adventist preachers stress different themes. Methodist preachers construct a problem and its solution out of the contrast between past and present and emphasize the maintenance of the rituals of the past. In contrast, Adventists present the state of the person as a problem in need of a solution and show greatest interest in the need for change in the present and in the coming of the end of the world in the fu- ture. The differing themes and different imaginations of temporality in Methodist and Adventist sermons evidence disparate doctrinal positions and serve as indexes of the contrasting forms of collectivity that the two churches strive to achieve. Methodist and Adventist preachers share a singular device, however, for thinking about the proper method of worship: problem and solution pairs. In other words, like joking de- bates, Methodist women's singing questions and Adventist elders' Sabbath School sessions, Fijian sermons focus on the completion of a specific form, and at this level of form, despite differences of content, striking similarities between Methodist and Ad- ventist ways of preaching emerge. The predominant theme of Methodist sermons concerns the relationship of the present to the past. Methodist preachers frequently use stories about early Fijian chiefs' encounters with Christianity (cf. Thornley and Vulaono 1996) as vehicles for the congregation's critique of its own sinful practices. In these sermons, early Fijians' conversion to Christianity and manner of worship are presented as a model for pre- sent-day Fijians whose life has lost its strength and vigor. Preachers often point to so- cial problems (such as the increasing crime rate among Fijians) and explain that these result from contemporary Fijians' improper manner of worship. For example, in a ser- mon delivered at the Suvavou Methodist Church during one Sunday worship service, a preacher from a nearby church pointed out that contemporary Fijians' manner of worship was not good enough: If you want Fiji and Fijians to be lively (bula), let Fiji restore the manner in which our ancestors (qase) "attended" (qaravi) God. Our ancestors accepted Christian clothing in 1835. Please forgive me, my relatives, for saying a word of criticism. The way God is worshipped today in Fiji is not proper.... That is why we have more rape and more murder today and the prisons are full. This is not the custom of Fijians.4 The preacher went on to illustrate early Fijians' rigor in seeking God by describing their first encounter with European missionaries: My relatives, I would like to show you the way our ancestors attended God. European missionaries arrived in Tubou but did not respect anything that Fijians were doing at the time. Our ancestors then wondered: "Where does the missionaries' strength come from? Where is their power?" From sunrise, throughout the day and into the evening until midnight, they looked for it. They then finally found Christ! The preacher then stopped and pointedly confronted the congregation: "If you say you have accepted Jesus today, I will ask you today if you have found him. How did you find him? I wish to point out to you the lesson of this story. If you search for him, you will find him." This critical commentary on contemporary Fijians' manner of worship exempli- fies the Methodist usage of conversion narratives and their emphasis on the relation- ship of present to past through the "maintenance" (maroroya) of the proper manner of worship (cf. Gewertz and Errington 1993; Jolly 1992, 1996:252-253; White 1991). In 36</page><page sequence="7">faith and its fulfillment this view, the truth about God and the attendance owed to Him by human beings is already entirely known in Fijians' past. Moreover, this theme of maintenance is ex- plored through a particular rhetorical form: a sermon often introduces a critical pic- ture of village life as a problem. It then offers early Fijians' manner of worship as the solution to these contemporary problems. Like a question and its answer, the pre- sent's problems are resolved in a return to the ritual forms of the past. In contrast, Adventist sermons rarely mention mission history. I heard only one sermon in Suvavou that referred to the chief's conversion to Adventism and the vil- lage's long history of Adventist belief. In this sermon, the preacher actually alluded to the past only to negate its importance. He opened his account with the parable of the payment of laborers at a vineyard (Matthew 20:1-16) in which the landowner re- wards equally the laborer employed from early in the morning and the laborer em- ployed at the very end of the day. The preacher then noted that the people of Suvavou had been the first to become Adventists in Fiji: I believe about a hundred years have passed since we accepted the church. [The chief of Suvavou] has been remembered throughout Fiji for generations. Many of us grew up inside this church. There are many faithful families. Blessed are those who are called to help the church's activities.... However, my relatives, I believe tonight that there is only one payment. Forget your beginning. Whether you start in the morning or at the end of the day, the Bible says that there is only one payment, that is, eternal life.5 Adventists' sermons focus on the present and the future-and, in particular, on church members' individual efforts to change themselves. In sermons and other relig- ious conversation, Adventists repeatedly remind themselves that people are sinful be- ings. Because the end of the world is approaching, each person needs to prepare him or herself by rendering his or her life "sin-free," "clean," "straight" and "truthful." As the resident minister of Suvavou's SDA Church told the congregation in one sermon, "I know you all will stand up to say, 'I have done something. God knows about it. There is something I have done and should tell Him.' This year, God's words chal- lenge us. Show Him something, something good, clean, straight, and holy in His eyes."6 Despite their different temporal orientations, however, both Methodists and Ad- ventists stress the importance of the proper manner of worship. Methodists portray early Fijian converts' attitude toward God as the ideal model. The Methodist preacher mentioned above emphasized that if contemporary Fijians revive this ideal manner of worship, everything will be better. Likewise, Adventists stress the sinfulness of human life and the importance of consistent efforts to dedicate one's life to God and to cleanse one's body and mind because the body and mind must evidence the proper attitude of worship. As evidenced by ancestors' conversion stories or Biblical par- ables, the preacher suggests that adopting the truthful manner of worship ensures one will receive God's response and guarantees one's life generally will "move forward" (toso). In other words, despite their diverging temporal orientations, both Methodists' use of the past and Adventists' use of the image of sin-free cleanness as the ideal mod- els for the present in their sermons implicate a similar temporal frame that defines the future as contingent on the congregation's renewed effort to conform itself to the ideal model. This critical commentary on the congregation's manner of worship is somewhat surprising, however, given that before the sermon begins, the congregation already has taken great care in its self-presentation. At both churches, church members pay enormous attention to the propriety of their appearance, speech, and conduct at church. Both Methodists and Adventists wear their best dress to church. Men wear a tie, a sulu vakataga ("pocket sulu" or skirts with pockets), a shiny white shirt, and a 37</page><page sequence="8">american ethnologist Western-style jacket.7 Women wear a white or other light-color long dress over a black or other dark-color sulu that covers their ankles and a pair of leather shoes with heals. Choir groups devote a number of hours during the week to practicing hymns. The congregation strives to attain the ideal model of worship the preacher offers as a solution and a source of closure. Why then does the preacher devalue and even deny the congregation's efforts to present its best appearance through attire, hymns, and speeches and stress instead the problematic nature of the present manner of worship, that is, the way in which it falls short of achieving the ideal model of worship? This question recalls the SDA Sabbath School sessions, although the role of the questioner in those sessions is less rigidly defined than that of the preacher. Sabbath School class members' efforts to answer a given question almost always fall short of the questioner's expectation, and the questioner ultimately answers his own question after dismissing the answers of other members as incomplete. In both cases, the preacher and the questioner temporarily negate the other side's effort to conform itself to an ideal model. They subsequently complete the round of engagement between the two sides by providing their own answer to the questions that they themselves origi- nally posed. mutual attendance Esther Goody has pointed out that a question often "compels, requires, may even demand, a response" (1978:23), and she has compared the question-answer form of conversation with gift exchange: "In the incomplete nature of the question there is a parallel with Malinowski's view of the gift-for the gift, like the question, demands a return. Both may be seen as social devices for compelling interaction-for forcing two partners to enter into a social exchange" (1978:23). Other writers, however, have challenged the assumption in Goody's analogy that questions are coercive as is the strategic act of questioning (e.g. Brenneis 1990:227-229; Goldman 1993:198; Mertz 1996; cf. Green 1975; Keenan et al. 1978). The sequential form of questions and answers or problems and solutions I have described in the context of Suvavou villagers' Christian worship does indeed bear a strong resemblance to Fijian gift exchange. For the Fijian case, however, the analogy of questioning and gift giving would be more fruitful if it were to focus on the form of the exchange of gifts and speeches itself instead of on the character of the debts that reciprocity engenders. What I have in mind is the distinctively Fijian form of gift ex- change, veiqaravi (mutual attendance),8 in which two sides exchange gifts and speeches (cf. Hocart 1952:51-52, 57; 1970[1936]:270). My focus here is on the tem- poral process of its completion rather than on "reciprocal duties" (Hocart 1970[1936]:270; cf. Bourdieu 1977:5). Veiqaravi, I will argue, is a form of interaction between two sides that sequentially completes itself. Veiqaravi rests on an indigenous theory of attendance and response repeatedly observed by anthropologists working in Fiji and in Polynesian societies. According to this theory, although gods, chiefs, and kings exert influence over people, the efficacy of gods, chiefs, and kings also depends upon people's attendance on them. For exam- ple, Valerio Valeri has observed that for Hawaiians the agency of gods and kings was activated by humans' belief in the efficacy of these entities: On the one hand, the gods are conceived as the autonomous source of all mana "power." But on the other hand, it is believed that the gods' power does not exist inde- pendently from man's worship and, in particular, from sacrifice .... Thus quite paradoxically, gods are the source of power but at the same time their worshipers are said to be the source of their power. [1985:89] 38</page><page sequence="9">faith and its fulfillment Likewise, Christina Toren has observed for contemporary Fiji: "People attend on (qarava, lit. 'face') the Christian God, who is above all. The old gods and ancestors still exist but their power has waned for they are no longer the object of the people's sacri- fices; so the Christian God is invoked not as 'the only god' but as 'the only god who is served.' " (1995:166). As Toren points out here, Fijians' devotion to the Christian God does not necessarily entail the complete negation of the presence of other gods. Rather, it is only their efficacy that is lost as a result of their loss of attendance. Atten- dance might be turned on a chief or god, Christian or otherwise (cf. Hashimoto 1984; Hocart 1970[1936]:99; Kaplan 1995:114; Kasuga 1994; Ravuvu 1987:259; Sahlins 1985:37-40). The temporal aspect of this theory of attendance and response, however, has es- caped anthropological attention so far. In what follows, I suggest that Fijian gift giving entails a moment at which gift givers place their own agency in abeyance and a sub- sequent moment at which gift receivers recuperate the gift-givers' agency. A compari- son between Christian rituals and gift-giving rituals will bring this temporal process into focus. In comparing Christian rituals and gift-exchange rituals, I do not mean to suggest that Fijian Christianity is simply an extension of the veiqaravi-style of interaction and thus is distinctively Fijian (Kaplan 1990; Sahlins 1985; Toren 1990; cf. Austin-Broos 1997; Comaroff 1985; Douglas 1995). Indeed, many aspects of Fijian Christian ritu- als, including the use of problem and solution or question and answer sets described above, are not at all unique to Fijian rituals (cf. Greenhouse 1986:77). Rather, I sug- gest that Christian rituals and Fijian gift-giving rituals can be treated as two versions (cf. Hollander 1959) of a singular form that unfolds in time. This treatment of two realms of knowledge encountered in Fiji parallels Fijians' own discourse on lotu (church) and vanua (land) as separate "paths." This discourse does not use either of these categories to explain the other. At times, Fijians observe that these two paths are the same. At others, they claim that the paths are entirely dif- ferent and therefore should not be mixed together or confused analytically. Anthropo- logical observations that Fijian Christian Churches have taken a distinctively Fijian form resonate with the former claim but contradict the latter. The latter already con- tains within itself, and rejects, the anthropological rendering of Fijian Christianity as a local manifestation. Instead of explaining one realm of knowledge as the outcome of the other, then, I aim to bring into view ritual participants' aesthetic experience (cf. Riles 1998) as a basis of the common Fijian assertion that the two ritual processes are at once the same and deeply separate. For Suvavou villagers, veiqaravi entails a very particular "aesthetic" or "con- straint of form" (Strathern 1988:180-181). As two parties face each other spatially and exchange gifts and speeches, both the gift givers and the gift receivers attend to each other in a manner emphasizing "mutual respect" (veidokai). In gift exchange, any ex- pression of conflict is out of place and to be avoided. Thus, for example, when clans that compete for leadership in Suvavou exchange gifts and speeches at one another's mortuary rites, neither raises issues of contention in their speeches. Rather, "the way of relationships" (vakaveiwekani) as a morally empowered practice, requires proper words to be uttered at such occasions. Gifts and speeches confirm the respectful rela- tionships between the two sides. This does not mean that gift giving is a mechanical act. A successful execution of gift giving calls for a spokesman's competent performance. Typically, the gift givers assemble a group of men and women who represent their clan, church, or other en- tity. A senior male figure who is particularly skilled in making speeches acts as the 39</page><page sequence="10">american ethnologist group's spokesman.9 The spokesman is usually a member of the clan, or of whatever entity he represents, although in some cases, the spokesman has no direct connection to the entity he represents.10 The spokesman does not consult with the delegation about what is to be said. He is assumed to know what is to be said on behalf of the delegation (see Arno 1976:82). Ritual participants are well aware of the variety of risks entailed in gift exchange. Immediate risks include the possibility that the gift receivers might reject the gift, al- though this is extremely rare. The spokesman or other members of the delegation may stray from the ideal model of mutual respect and may express overt criticism of the gift receivers during the course of the event. Participants' intentional or unintentional mis- givings may ultimately lead to the failure of gift exchange, as gift receivers may later comment on the spokesman's poor performance or on the inadequacy of the gifts, and they may speculate about the negative consequences this poor performance may have on the gift givers. Such "failure" is made evident when the spokesman or his clansman becomes sick or dies following the exchange (see Arno 1976:82; Belshaw 1964:144-145; Miyazaki 1997; cf. Becker 1995; de Marzan 1987; Spencer 1966 [1941 ]). Yet what is important is that the awareness of these risks does not overpower participants' commitment to completion. In what follows, I discuss how an exchange of speeches between two sides achieves this sense of completion. In every case of gift exchange, the gift-givers' designated spokesman moves for- ward as the gift-givers' delegation sits quietly behind him, facing the gift receivers. Sit- ting on his knees holding a tabua (whale's tooth), he delivers a speech as the gifts (mats, money, or food) are piled beside him. The first task the spokesman faces is to de- fine the two sides, that is, the participants both present and absent.11 The spokesman typically begins with an acknowledgement of the various groups of people on the re- ceiving side by addressing himself to their chiefs by their titular names. For example, the spokesman for a delegation from an outer island made the following speech on the occasion of a mortuary exchange for a Suvavou woman's death: Spokesman for the gift givers [S]: In the chiefly manner, [I address myself] to Nadonumai [the ceremonial name used for Kai Suvavou], to the chief Tui Suva, Vasu ki Bau ["the uterine nephew of Bau"]. Gift receivers in unison [G]: Wa oi oi u. S: [I also address myself] to the Mataqali Y [the gift receivers], to the turaga [lit. "chiefs"], its itaukei ["owners," meaning "clansmen"]. G: Vinaka saka [lit. "Good, Sir" meaning "Thank you, Sir"]. S: [I also address myself to] the chiefly land of Nakorotubu [from which the de- ceased originated], to the chief Gonesau [the chief of Nakorotubu]. G: Vinaka. S: [I also address myself] to the chiefly relatives who have gathered together at your place tonight. G: Vinaka. The speaker then explains the reason for his delegation's visit. He usually apolo- gizes for the shameful inappropriateness of the gifts (cf. Hocart 1929:71; Hooper 1982:122) and the lateness of his clan's arrival. In this case, for example, the spokes- man for the gift givers said: S: We thought we would come earlier but the travel was difficult. We crossed the sea so that we might join you on this important occasion today. Valuables displayed here are only small reguregu [lit. "kissing with the nose," meaning death gifts] from [our chief]. G: Levu (Big!) 40</page><page sequence="11">faith and its fulfillment S: We thought we would bring something good. Here is a small mat, tea, food, and an envelope [referring to money] ... but if it is not useful, please forgive us.12 In this listing of apologies, the spokesman usually notes how long and redundant his speech is. At the end of the speech, the spokesman emphasizes the close blood ties be- tween the two sides and requests that the gift-receiving side accept the gifts and his speech. The speech ends with the mention of the titular names of the gift-givers' and the gift-receivers' chiefs. In this case, for example, the spokesman concluded, "[These are] death gifts from Nabala, from Tui Nakasa, to Nadonumai, to the chief Tui Suva, to the Mataqali Y, to the turaga, its clansmen. To Nakorotubu, to Gonesau, and to the descendants that follow." After finishing his speech, the spokesman for the gift givers remains motionless holding a tabua in front of him until a spokesman for the gift re- ceivers takes the tabua away from him. The speaker then retires to join other members of his clan. The tabua is first passed to the chief or the most senior member of the gift receiv- ers who kisses the tabua and proclaims that it is accepted. For example, in response to the speech above, the most senior member of the gift receivers said, "I have touched the valuable, a good valuable, a valuable of relationships, togetherness, thickness of blood ties." This speech consists of only one or two sentences (cf. Hooper 1982:122) and often ends with a standard phrase referring to the Christian God, such as "May all of us [inclusive of both sides] be led only by God (da liutaki tiko mada ga mai vua na Kalou"'3 (cf. Ravuvu 1987:254-260). After this, the tabua is passed to the spokesman for the gift receivers who gives a longer speech in which he acknowledges the gift-giv- ers' effort as "respectful" (vakarokoroko) and "chiefly" (vakaturaga) and negates the necessity of gifts (cf. Hooper 1982:122). For example, following the brief speech above, the gift-receivers' spokesman said, "You did not need to bring anything. You should have brought only yourselves. We could have just met in the manner of rela- tives (sota ga vakaveiwekani). However, you came with a large whale's tooth, valu- ables, and food. I thank you very much." The speech of the gift-receivers' spokesman ends with a series of prayers and al- ways refers to the Christian God. In this case, the following was said at the end of the speech: Your valuables have been offered to Heaven so that we all may be given Heavenly blessing. May Tui Nabala [the gift-givers' chief] be blessed. May your descendants be blessed so that they may study well everyday to grow up to be strong enough to attend on our God.... May God love us together and may our duties be possible. Our mu- tual love is the only valuable. When the speaker finishes his speech with this reference to "mutual love" (veilomani), all present respond, "Let it be effective and true!" (Mana ei dina!) (cf. Hocart 1929:71; Hooper 1982:122; Ravuvu 1987:254). This is usually followed by the standard phrase: "I will lay my hands on the gift ... the whale's tooth, valuables, and food .... It is plenty! Things from the past, things from the past" (cf. Ravuvu 1987:78, 82, 86). In response, all shout, "A muduo, muduo, duo'I4 while clapping their hands. Then, in the same humble manner in which the gift givers present their gift, the receivers pre- sent a whale's tooth as a return gift (dirika) and thank the gift givers for their effort while the gift givers in turn declare that the return gift is accepted.15 Fijians say that the com- pletion of gift exchange generates a sense of "finality" (sa oti) among all participants. It is important to note, however, that although veiqaravi is then completed, it is often fol- lowed by further rounds of veiqaravi. For example, the identical form of exchange of gifts and speeches is repeated between the hosting clan and different visiting clans 41</page><page sequence="12">american ethnologist during the course of mortuary rites, and it is understood to be part of a succession of other occasions for gift exchange. As described here, there are remarkable similarities between gift-giving rituals and church services. As in sermons and Bible study sessions that sequentially present problem and solution (or question and answer), the spokesman for the gift givers poses a problem for the gift receivers to solve. For example, when the gift-givers' spokesman describes their gift as problematic, "small" (lailai), "useless" (sega ni yaga), and so forth, the gift receivers immediately shout, "Big!" (Levu!), and confirm the propriety of the gift. In his speech, the gift-receivers' spokesman eventually solves the gift-givers' concern with their gifts (repeatedly expressed by the gift-givers' spokes- man) by celebrating the generosity of the gift givers and ultimately by denying the need for gifts. In presenting an ideal image of mutual respect and eternal blood ties between the gift givers and the gift receivers as the solution to the problem posed by the gift-givers' spokesman, the gift-receivers' spokesman reveals "mutual love" as the ultimate gift that negates the necessity of gift giving itself at the end of his speech. Like the gift-givers' spokesmen's humble comments on the gift-givers' gifts, such as "small" and "useless" and the gift-receivers' responses to these comments such as "big," the gift-givers' spokesman's speech as a whole and the gift-receivers' spokesman's speech form a set of a problem and solution. Furthermore, in both the Christian and gift-giving rituals, the role of the Sabbath School questioner, the preacher, or the gift-givers' spokesman, is instrumental in com- pleting these sets of problems and solutions. More precisely, the role of the ques- tioner, the preacher, or the spokesman is to negate and problematize the efforts of the other members of the class, of the congregation, or of the gift givers to conform to an ideal manner of attendance. These figures also share another common task: they ulti- mately offer a solution to the very problem they bring to the other side's attention. In the case of church rituals, the questioner and the preacher solve the problem they pose by confirming the same ideal model to which ritual participants have already striven to conform. Even though, as we have seen, participant roles involve diverging degrees of rigidity and scriptedness, all frame questions and answers (or problems and solutions) and do so in a sequential manner. Most importantly, this similarity between Christian and gift-giving rituals at the level of form finds a homology in another confluence at the level of content. The com- pletion of these sets of sequences (problems and solutions) coincides with a moment at which speakers express a hope for a response from the Christian God or the Holy Spirit. Recall Sakeasi's mention in the Sabbath School class of God's response to one's confession and of the Holy Spirit's response to one's straight manner of asking a ques- tion; recall also Methodist and Adventist preachers' repeated emphasis of the idea that the congregation's proper manner of attendance on God would elicit God's re- sponse. Likewise, in the gift-giving ritual, the spokesman for the gift receivers con- cludes his speech by referring to a hope for the response of the Christian God in such prayers as "May all of us [inclusive of the gift givers as well as the gift receivers] be led only by God" or, "Your valuables have been offered up to Heaven so that we all may be given Heavenly blessing." The role of the questioner and the preacher in church rituals is similar to the role of the spokesman in gift-giving rituals in effectuating a moment of abeyance of agency-a moment at which all present cease to emphasize their actions or others' and instead look to God for a response. One way to understand such abeyance, ambiguation (Battaglia 1998), or indirec- tion (Brenneis 1986) of agency is to view it as the ultimate strategic act of rhetorical manipulation. For example, in his study of Cretan shepherds' use of oaths, Michael 42</page><page sequence="13">faith and its fulfillment Herzfeld has called such moments "structural nostalgia" (1990, 1997). Herzfeld writes that "People generally ignore human agency when it suits them to do so.... [They] invent, refashion and exploit ... [timeless] structures as moral alibis for their contingent actions" (1997:113). Likewise, in his study of ritual speech in Anakalang, Eastern Indonesia, Webb Keane (1994) has discussed a similar strategic abeyance of human agency as a tool for overcoming the risks that ritual itself makes explicit. Ac- cording to Keane, "to speak with couplets [according to the manner by which ances- tors speak] is ... to display a strategy of avoidance .... The indirection and distanc- ing effects of ritual speech protect its users from the challenges each presents to the other-or rather, they allow its users to act as if such protection were necessary" (1994:620, emphasis in original). Here, Keane suggests that the use of a particular style of speech renders participants aware of the risks involved in the exchange of gifts and defines the management of these risks as the task of exchange.16 In this act of abeyance, exchange creates the possibility of experiencing the efficacy of ancestral agency itself. The Fijian case, however, draws attention to ritual participants' commitment to completion rather than strategies for controlling risks. For Fijians, the abeyance of agency entails a three-step process-that is, ritual participants' efforts to conform to an ideal model, the problematization of their efforts, and the presentation of the same ideal model as a solution. As exemplified most starkly by the utter stillness of the gift- givers' spokesman at the end of his speech as he awaits the gift-receivers' response, the exchange of problems and solutions in gift giving, preaching, and Bible study en- tails a temporary negation of ritual participants' agency. At the moment at which the gift-givers' spokesman remains motionless, he subjects the gift givers to a risk of rejec- tion-he places his hope in the other side's hands. Likewise, when the questioner dis- misses other class members' questions, and when the preacher negates the congrega- tion's effort to conform to the ideal model of worship as inadequate, the questioner and the preacher suspend the agency of the other class members and the congrega- tion, respectively. In turn, the solution the questioner, the preacher, and the gift-re- ceivers' spokesman provide always lies in the proper manner of attendance. Ultimately, however, the temporal trajectory of the abeyance and the subsequent recovery of agency preceding the ultimate moment of the abeyance of human agency in these rituals enables participants to anticipate another moment of completion. In other words, the three-step process simulates an ultimate response. From this stand- point, it is clear that by repeatedly presenting sets of questions and answers or prob- lems and solutions, Fijian ritual participants experience intimations of an ultimate re- sponse. It is through the appreciation for, or "empathy" (Bateson 1979:8) toward the completeness of these sets, I claim, that Fijian ritual participants experience the fulfill- ment of their faith, as the capacity repeatedly to place their own agency in abey- ance.17 faith as an emergent form In this article, one of my aims has been to express reservations about the terms in which anthropologists have tackled the description of experientially inaccessible agents such as God and spirits. Although these descriptive problems may also be fruit- fully examined in relation to current debates about how to describe human and non- human agents in a singular plane (e.g., Latour 1988, 1993; Law 1986), I focus instead on the anthropological assumption that the problem of rendering these agents acces- sible is universal and hence shared by anthropologists and their subjects. Yet as Marilyn Strathern has noted, "Scholars trained in the Western tradition cannot really 43</page><page sequence="14">american ethnologist expect to find others solving the metaphysical problems of Western thought" (1988:3). Her broader point is that the questions anthropologists ask tell as much about Western problems as about non-Western solutions (1988:4). As I have shown, others may not share the descriptive problem I have identified in relation to these agents. Rather, Fijian Christians focus on the limits that are placed on their agency rather than on agents of other kinds. Thus a second observation might be that the fo- cus on the question of intentions and its accompanied persistent, if implicit, anthropo- morphization of agency in anthropological studies obscures others' experience of moments of abeyance of agency. An understanding of such conceptions of agency demands other analytical strategies than a simple extension of the model of individual selfhood to collective or non-human entities. A wider theoretical implication of this ethnographic observation concerns how rituals generate faith (cf. Asad 1993:48-52; Geertz 1973:114-118). Anthropologists have focused their analysis more on the objects or manifestations of others' religious devotion, as ideas, symbols, or discourse, than on the character of faith itself. Anthro- pologists have often regarded the latter as something beyond their analytical scope (cf. Tillich 1957). I have argued, however, that faith as the capacity to place one's agency in abeyance is ethnographically accessible. Fijian rituals do not rest on a the- ory of the intentions of non-human agents. Rather, Fijian rituals are founded on an aesthetics of completion that calls for a temporary negation of human agency. By lim- iting human capacity to act, at least temporarily, participants in these rituals create space for the intimations of the fulfillment of their faith. It is not what is beyond this moment of fulfillment that is crucial from ritual participants' viewpoint. What is more crucial is the fact that this moment leaves one with a hope for an ultimate response. notes Acknowledgments.

Finally, I would like to express my profound thanks to the Fiji Govern- ment for granting me permission to conduct research in Fiji and to the members of the Methodist and Seventh-day Adventist churches in Suvavou for welcoming me in their activities. Fieldwork in Fiji from August 1994 to March 1996 was funded by the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies at the Australian National University. All ceremonial speeches, sermons, and transcripts of Bible study sessions excerpted in this article are transcripts of tape recordings. I thank Alu- mita, Atelina, and Niko of Suvavou for their assistance with transcription of the tapes. Transla- tions are mine. All Bible passages are quoted from the Good News Bible (Revised Edition; Ingleburn, NSW, Australia: The Bible Society in Australia, 1994). I dedicate this article to the memory of the late Sakeasi Tuni Koroi of Suvavou. 1. At the time of fieldwork, Suvavou had a population of approximately 600. Suvavou has been studied by several anthropologists including A. M. Hocart (n.d.[a]:2507-2516, 2564-2571, 2588-2592, n.d.[b]:374a-374j), Henry Rutz (1987) and Solrun Williksen-Bakker (1986, 1990). The villagers' ancestors, the people of Suva (Kai Suva), were removed from the Suva Peninsula to the current village site in 1882 when the colonial capital was established in Suva (see Miyazaki 1997). For the history of the Kai Suva, see Sahlins 1991 and Wall 1920. 44</page><page sequence="15">faith and its fulfillment 2. According to missionary records, the chief of Suva accepted Christianity and became a Methodist in 1840 (Cargill 1977:179; Jaggar 1988:45). In 1898, however, his son converted to the Seventh-day Adventist Church (see Hare 1969). Subsequently, this original chiefly clan be- came extinct and a Methodist clan assumed the chiefly title. At the time of my fieldwork, the Methodist Church had a membership of 314 while the SDA Church had a membership of 270. Others belong to Catholic, Assemblies of God, and other churches all of which are located out- side the village. Although it is not unusual for a Fijian village to accommodate more than one Christian de- nomination, Suvavou's history of religious pluralism is unique in its scale. According to the 1986 census, the latest census from which data is available, the vast majority of Fiji's ethnic Fi- jian population (74.2 percent) belongs to the Methodist church, while Seventh-day Adventists constitute only four percent of the ethnic Fijian population (Fiji Government 1988:100; cf. Ernst 1994:202). 3. Sabbath School classes follow a booklet known as The Adult Sabbath School Lessons produced at the SDA Church's international headquarters. Classes usually focus on a particular section of Scripture such as The Book of Joshua (April-June 1995), or on a particular subject matter such as the Holy Spirit (July-September 1995) or the proper method of Bible study (Janu- ary-March 1996). 4. Sermon at the Suvavou Methodist Church, June 18, 1995. 5. Sermon at the Suvavou SDA Church, February 3, 1996. 6. Sermon at the Suvavou SDA Church, January 13, 1996. 7. Although some Adventist men, especially young members of the church, prefer to wear trousers instead of a sulu skirt especially in the winter, SDA elders in Suvavou village usually wear sulu vakataga. 8. The veiqaravi form is used in every kind of gift exchange ranging from marriage cere- monies and mortuary rites to apology (see Arno 1976; Hashimoto 1984; Ravuvu 1987; Willik- sen-Bakker 1986). Although the term veiqaravi may be translated as "facing each other," especially when it describes the spatial arrangement of Fijian gift-exchange ceremonies (see Toren 1990:1), I translate the phrase as "mutual attendance" in this article, following Hocart's rendering of the term as "mutual ministration" (1 970[1936]:270). 9. The role of the spokesman in Fijian gift exchange may have derived from a more institu- tionalized role of the high chief's spokesman (matanivanua, lit. "face of the land"). Unlike the influential Samoan tulafale, or orator (see Duranti 1994; Shore 1982; cf. Yankah 1995), the matanivnaua's political role is limited to the proper arrangement of ritual attendance (Hocart 1970[19361:191). 10. For example, when a delegation consists of women or young men, a man from the gift- receiving side may speak on behalf of the delegation. 11. The identity of the "side" is ambiguous and open to interpretation at infinitely receding levels of generality. The group of men and women assembled for the ceremony is a "delegation" representing multiple entities that may not be present. A gift-giving event is located at the end of a longer chain of numerous gift-exchange events on the gift-givers' side in that gift givers have accumulated gifts from among a wider range of people than the gift-giving group specifically represented in their spokesman's speech. Each smaller gift exchange event takes a less elabo- rate but similar veiqaravi form. At each level, the gift-receivers' side assumes full responsibility as to how to use the gifts they receive. As Fijians stress, the gift givers have no say over the way the gift receivers distribute the gifts at the next stage of exchange. In other words, at the time of exchange of gifts and speeches, the question of who actually contributed to this event behind the scenes or who will receive a portion of the gifts is not important. That is a question each side contemplates on its own before and after the event. 12. Speech at a mortuary exchange in Suvavou, September 27, 1995. 13. The Fijian language distinguishes the first person plural inclusive pronouns (daru, da- tou and da) by which the speaker refers to both him or herself and those to whom he or she is speaking from the first person plural exclusive pronouns (keirau, keitou and keimaml) by which the speaker excludes those to whom he or she is speaking. 45</page><page sequence="16">american ethnologist 14. The meaning of this phrase is not clear. A. Capell focuses on the meaning of the word, mudu (to cut or cease), and translates the phrase as "It is over!" (1941). Asesela Ravuvu trans- lates it as "Accepted with deep reverence!" (1987). Hocart does not provide a translation (1929:71). 15. When the relationship between the gift givers and the gift-receivers is very close, the gift-receivers' offer to make a return gift is turned down by the gift givers. 16. In focusing on strategic devices entailed in ritual form, Keane has extended the work of Judith Irvine and others (e.g., Brenneis and Myers 1984; Irvine 1979) aimed at correcting a sim- plistic view of form in ritual and ritual speech as limits on the possibilities of challenge to the pre-existing power relations (e.g., Bloch 1975; see Keane 1997b:54, 1997c:6, 144). 17. In discussing the relationship between hermeneutics and faith, Paul Ricceur has pro- posed to go beyond the study of faith "through its linguistic and literary expressions": Faith is the attitude of one who accepts being interpreted at the same time that he or she in- terprets the world of the text .... This is not to say that faith is not authentically an actthat cannot be reduced to linguistic treatment. In this sense, faith is the limit of all hermeneutics and the nonhermeneutical origin of all interpretation. The ceaseless movement of interpre- tation begins and ends in the risk of a response that is neither engendered nor exhausted by commentary. [1995:46, emphasis in original] As implied in Ricoeur's definition, faith involves taking a risk, that is, exposing oneself to what is beyond interpretive control. We overcome this risk, Ricoeur implies, by keeping hope: "[Faith] could be called 'unconditional trust' to say that it is inseparable from a movement of hope that makes its way in spite of the contradictions of experience and that turns reasons for despair into reasons for hope" (1995:47). references cited Arno, Andrew 1976 Joking, Avoidance, and Authority: Verbal Performance as an Object of Exchange in Fiji.
