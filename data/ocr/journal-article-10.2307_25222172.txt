<plain_text><page sequence="1">Art&gt; Archaeology, Anthropology Figures of Speech or Figures of Thought. By Ananda K. Coomaraswamy. London: Messrs. Luzac and Co. 10s. 6d. Each of these seventeen Collected Essays touches on some aspect of the traditional theory of art. Dr. Coomaraswamy denounces European scholarship when it seeks to divorce the purely aesthetic quality of a work of art from its spiritual origin and content. The understanding of Buddhist art is quite beyond the competence of the rationalist mind that regards the aesthetic surface appeal as valid in itself. Dr. Coomaraswamy deplores the divorce of use and ornament. Art should seek to establish values of use before those of ornament. The purely aesthetic qualities, " adequate relations of masses and so forth," are merely " art-forms ", whoso inner meaning has dried out of them and left them empty shells. The proper nature and purpose of " art-forms " or " images " is nowhere better defined than in Plato's Republic (Jowett, 510 D.E.): "... do you not know . . . that although they make use of the visible forms . . . they are thinking not of these, but of the ideals which they resemble ; not of the figures which they draw . . . but they are really seeking to behold the things themselves, which can only be seen with the eye of the mind ? " ; which, indeed, expresses the same idea as St. Basil's formula : " The respect that is paid to the image passes over-to its archetype" (De Sancta Spirita). How did the Buddha come to be represented in an anthropo morphic form ? Dr. Coomaraswamy answers, because the Enlightened One had " to reveal himself in accordance with the nature of those who perceive him ". Early Indian art had employed only geometrical, vegetable, or theriomorphic symbols as " supports of contemplation ", not from inability to represent the human figure ; for the human figure had been carved very skilfully in the third millennium B.C. But the Buddha was represented only</page><page sequence="2">reviews of books 127 by Footprints, or such symbols as the Tree or the Wheel. Vedic prophets were forever seeking to track the Hidden Light by the traces of its footsteps. When the Buddha was asked by what symbol he could properly be represented in his absence, he answered by a Bodhi-trec (a paribhoga-cetiya). The symbol of the Tree is not Buddhist. The Vedas speak of a Great Yaksa (Brahman) moving on the waters in a fiery glowing at the centre of the universe in the likeness of a Tree, and this Burning Bush, the Single Fig, is called in the Upanisads the "one Awakener" (eka sambodhayitr), and everlasting support of the contemplation of Brahman. The representation of a " deified" Buddha arose after the Great Awakening, when the Buddha was no longer thought of as a man among other men, but as " the form of humanity that has nothing to do with time ". Dr. Coomaraswamy emphasizes that the pro vision of aesthetic pleasure from the Buddha image was a necessary concession to those incapable of attaining the direct vision. Purely abstract art is adapted to contemplative uses, and implies a gnosis; anthropomorphic art evokes an emotion corresponding to prayer and supplication. " The Madonnas of Raphael and Titian," wrote Emerson, " were made to be worshipped "; they were not " a mere flourish to please the eye ". It is only the few who can afford to dispense with theology, ritual, and imagery. We need to see the image of the Buddha before we can see the Buddha in the image. The Buddha image is not a naturalistic portrait, " not a reflection of anything that has been physically seen, but an intelligible form or formula." The majority cannot maintain themselves upon the " unsullied plane " of pure icono graphic characteristics, on " a mere painting in colour on space ". The master-painter disposes his colours for the sake of a picture not to be found in the colours nor in things themselves. It is only to make it acceptable to creatures for whom there is still object and subject that the picture is contrived. The work of art is but the dark form of what in itself is the perfect brilliance. We can only rightly carve and paint, or con template what is carved and painted, as students of " the mystery of Form ". For, " as nothing can be said to have been intelligibly uttered unless in certain terms, so nothing can be said to have been revealed unless in some form." Victor Rienaecker.</page></plain_text>
