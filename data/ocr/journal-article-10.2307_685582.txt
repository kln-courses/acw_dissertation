<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHYSICS AND BIOLOGY* ERNEST H. HUTTEN I TODAY the task is more imperative than ever before to mvestigate the so-called living sciences and to find out in what respects they resemble or differ from physics. Most of us are m agreement nowadays that we cannot expect, say, biology, to have theories and laws of the same type as physics. We have learned to respect the fact that the model of particles in motion is not adequate for describing living processes. Biologists no longer want to imitate Newtonian physics when they theonse. There remains, however, the suspicion sometimes-perhaps more among philosophers than among biologists-that at least the logical and semantic structure of a biological theory should be the same as that of a physical theory, however much the theories differ m subject- matter, or m the objects they treat of. We have given up the ideal of mechamcism-I do not want to call it ' physicalism' since this has other connotations-but we may still harbour the ideal of a methodo- logical mechamcism. We may still believe, that is, that biological theory should be expressed m terms of a differential equation of the second order like mechanics, though of course the interpretation of the two theones would differ from one another. I think that, while admitting that there is something in this wish, it may senously minuslead us all the same. Logic and mathematics are formal, m the sense that they fit any subject-matter: but what kind of formalism may be used depends on the subject-matter. Few people nowadays would impose upon biology, for example, the causal pattern as we know it from physics. This is not merely because they have accepted the fact that, in spite of its great success, physics is not the basic theory to which all others can be reduced: physics, biology, psychology, etc., treat of fundamentally different objects. It is also because the causal structure m physics has become * Given at the Fourth Annual Conference m Philosophy of Science, Cambridge, 25-27 September 1959. IOI</page><page sequence="2">ERNEST H. HUTTEN less simple and less rigid-statistics has loosened the hold which necessity seemed to possess over the realm of inanimate things. Determinism as we know it from the interpretation of Newtonian mechamcs current in the last century is definitely out. With it must go the prejudice that the mathematical structure which was believed to represent this determinism, i.e. the differential equation of the second order, has to be employed in biology. From such an equation, given the initial and boundary conditions, a unique solution can be derived; and this solution is then interpreted to describe the unique and necessary behaviour, i.e. an orbit, of a mechamcal particle. If we remember that biological and psychological processes are ' over-determined', that there is ' multiple causation ', then we realise that the search for a differential equation may be very inappropriate in biology. And so on. I do not wish to talk here about laws m physics and in a ' livng' science-it would be too large a subject. I must and want to confuie myself to the concepts which Professor Woodger has chosen for his topic, illustrating the structure of biological theory. This is the wholc- part relation and what follows from it, namely, physiology, mor- phology, and genetics, as constituents of biology. This then is a problem of methodology, of what kind of theory to construct, of what type of logical structures to incorporate Into a theory. Can we have a physiology, morphology, or genetics within physics? Let me say m anticipation of a more detailed argument that, I think, a morphology and genetics, certainly, and perhaps even some- thing like a physiology can be found in physical theory as well. However, we must be reasonable in making the comparison. Usually we compare a biological theory with Newtonian mechanics or even with quantum mecharucs, that is, with a highly developed, abstract theory. Naturally we find few if any points ofcomparison: more often than not we are at a loss to say anything, for we need some common ground which we are hard put to find under these circumstances. My idea is to compare biological theory with a physical theory that is relatively undeveloped and new and therefore simple m structure: this is the theory of radio-activity and, more importantly, the new and quite tentative theory of strangeness describing the behaviour of elc- mnentary particles. 2 The main fact is, in my view, that biological objects are tune- dependent and that biological processes are genuminely dynamical, that is, 102</page><page sequence="3">PHYSICS AND BIOLOGY result in Irreversible changes. This is in contrast to the usual physical object, e.g. the Newtonian particle, which is permanent and only suffers space-time displacement. Even if more complicated physical processes are considered, there are always one or more conservation principles. Classical thermodynamics is only thermostatics, correctly speaking; for the three basic ideas of closed system, equilibrium state, and reversible path preclude an over-all genuine change of the system (though they allow a partial change as measured by the entropy). The relation of existential dependence, according to Professor Woodger, is the basic principle of biology. Livmg things are wholes containing parts that stand in this relation to one another. Thus the whole/part relation is the basic concept. Parts that belong to the same level need each other for continued existence, and this is phys- iology. The parts also exhibit a spatial hierarchical order, or levels; and thus a morphology comes about. Finally, the wholes are ' time- extended': there is the parental relation between wholes, develop- ment occurs; and we have genetics. If we look at radio-active atoms or unstable, elementary particles, we can almost identify them with a biological cell. They satisfy three out of the four conditions Professor Woodger has laid down for cells. (i) Every particle is time-extended and has a beginning and an end in time; (ii) the beginning of every particle is either part of the end of a previously existing particle or is formed by the union of the end of two previously existing particles; (iii) every particle has exis- tentially dependent parts. The fourth condition, that every cell has an environment, does not find an analogue in radio-activity at least, since decay of particles is totally independent of external mfluence and an intrinsic characteristic of the atom or particle. There are four radio-active series or families. A parent atom or nuclide produces a daughter-nuclide by means of three possible activities, i.e. ax-, /-, y-decay This gives rise to a hierarchy, starting from the original radio-active atom and ending in the stable end- product. An illustration is given by the thorium radio-active series. Physicists were of course always aware that they had taken over their terminology from the biologists. There is also a historical, and often forgotten, connection between cell and atom. For both origi- nally stem from the Greek atom, that is, the basic building-block that is permanent and indestructible out of which everything else in nature is constructed. Moreover, all change is explained by the shifting combmination of these building-blocks, so that there never is any genuine Io3</page><page sequence="4">ERNEST H. HUTTEN destruction or loss. This concept was the outcome of the lonian school of physiologoi from which modern physics, and science as a whole, developed. The cell is the analogue of the atom in the living sciences. And just as the atom, in modem times, showed signs of splitting, became divisible, so did the cell. The split is always in the direction of smaller, but indestructible and therefore final, building- blocks. In physics, we ended up with the electron, proton, and neutron as the only stable, elementary particles; and we had to adrmt a host of unstable particles, mesons, as well as positrons and neutrinos. In biology, it is, I suppose, the gene that is taken as stable and immutable constituent. Therefore, it is no surprise that such far-going parallelism can be found between radio-active families and cell development. Indeed, corresponding to the biological evolutions we have the evolution of the earth, or the solar system, or the galaxy, or even of the whole universe that is calculated upon the radio-active decay of ele- ments. Thus the evolutionary aspect and genetics are very similar in physics and biology. There is only this difference: the life-times involved in physics-the half-lives of radio-active or unstable particles- range from microseconds to millions of years. In biology the range is very much smaller. There is also a spatial hierarchy-a kind of morphology among the atoms. For neutrons and protons make up a nucleus, nucleons and electrons form an atom, atoms combine to molecules, molecules form compounds, or crystals, etc. This relation we see-at least to some extent-in spatial terms. There is only this difference: the spatial structures in physics are very much simpler than those of biology.' Finally, we come to what may be the analogue of physiology in ?hysics. The relation of 'needing' is too anthropomorphic, too antagonistic to the inanimate realm, for us to want to use it. All the same, the combination of atoms into molecules, for imstance-that is, the phenomenon of chemical valency-has been sometimes regarded from this viewpoint. Indeed, our terminology m physics has ui fact been derived from biology. The alchemists did say that the force of valency represents the need of one atom for the other. We speak today of affinity, e.g. the alkali atom and the halogen atom have a strong affinity for each other-electron affinity-and form alkali halides. It is true, however, that one or the other atom can happily survive without It has been suggested to me that the stars furnsh a better example of morphology, i.e. stars, clusters, galaxies, etc., since it is achieved through a classification of more directly observed objects. Io4</page><page sequence="5">PHYSICS AND BIOLOGY their need being satisfied-unlike the biological case. There is then this difference: chemical affimty can be described in simple terms, as a matter of energy balance and electron exchange which are subject to conservation principles. 3 Professor Woodger remarks, at the end of (the first version of) his paper that biology exhibits three main, conceptual difficulties as compared to physics. First, generalisations are almost impossible to make; second, there is little mathematcal formalism to bring about a 'scientific' language; third, biologists have not yet learned to formu- late their laws as functional relations. Similar difficulties are encountered, however, if we look at the most recent theory of elementary particles m physics. This so-called strange- ness theory is unlike any theory that has ever been formulated m physics; and it is much more concerned with classification and direct observation as biology is often said to be. It is quite impossible, at least at this moment, to imagine any other, more conventional, type of theory for describmg the creation and destructon of particles: we seem to have struck rock bottom. Thus it may be of interest to the methodologist to describe this theory briefly. The great, and quite inexplicable, variety of elementary particles is arranged according to four classes: the heavy baryons, the inter- mediate mesons, the light leptons, and the photon. Similarly, the mteraction between particles appear to be m four classes. The strongest interaction, among baryons and mesons, is due to nuclear forces; the much weaker, electromagnetic interaction connects all charged particles (and those with electric or magnetic moments) through the mediation of photons; a still weaker mter- action leads to the P-decay (of ~, n, K) and the u-decay (of w- and K-mesons) which involve the neutrino; finally, an interaction of about the same strength as the P-decay leads to the decay of the strange particles. The relative strengths of these mteractions is estimated by the life- times of the excited states whose decay they govern. To cut the story short: certain anomalies are found, namely, that the decay of some of the particles is unexpectedly slow-instead of an expected mean life of 10o-9 sec., the observed value is Io- sec. The basic assumption is made that these are 'strange' particles that cannot be produced in a H Io5</page><page sequence="6">ERNEST H. HUTTEN collision except in association with other such particles; and that each particle carries away some quantised quantity which the other needs m order to decay. In a nuclear collision this quantity is conserved in its total amount, but its conservation is not rigorous and, indeed, must be violated in the decay process. This quantity is the 'strangeness Np 237Np 93 2251x10 23 233U Pa 233Pa 91 27-4d Th 229Th 90 70009 Ac 225Ac 89'1 10 Od Rd 225Ra8 88 14 8d c Fr 221Fr 87 4 8m Em L, 86 At 217At, 85 -020s po 213po 84 114 2us B( 213Bi 98%y 209BL 83 47m , stable Pb C 209pb 82 2% 3h IL 2090 81 22m The neptunium (4nH) radioactive series. (it is a ' generalisation ' of the isotopic spin which, m turn, is a' generali- sation' of the ordinary spin . . .). If Q is the charge, A the mass number of the particle, T its isotopic spin quantum number, T, the component of T, and S the strangeness, then: Q = T -1- + A + SS. By choosing T, A, and S appropriately, we can describe the knmd and number of particles that may occur m a nuclear collision. Io6</page><page sequence="7">PHYSICS AND BIOLOGY The main methodological problem here is then, as m biology: How is such a simple theory tested? The theory does not predict anything; it does not predict that the result of a collision between two particles is such and such, because there is no way of deliberately bnnging about such a collision. The natural decay of unstable par- ticles is not under our control. All we can say is that, having observed a certain, naturally occurring collision, the resultant particles fall into the scheme provided by the theory. Similarly, within radio-activity, we cannot predict a priori whether a certain, artificially produced (transuranic) element, for instance, decays into this or that element. We can only find out that, if the decay is of such and such a kind, then the resulting element will be thus or that. Or, to take still another example, we do not know a priori how to fill the gaps m the Periodic Table (they have, m fact, been filled by now) or to predict which, or how many different, transuramc elements can be produced. All we can say is that, whatever element we find, will fit into the scheme the theory has provided. I think this situation is interesting, however simple it may be; there are similarities with biology. The standard model for testing a hypothesis, namely, to predict the next occurrence of a known event m space-time, e.g. an eclipse, or a particle m its path, does not apply here. We must, however, distinguish between the actual experimental arrangement and the interpretation of the results. We may, for example, establish the existence of a new transuranic element by means of a mass spectrograph, that is, by observing a beam of particles, or a deposit of particles, in a certain space-time region. That this element exists, and that it does fit into the scheme, that it possesses the properties the Periodic Table predicts, is judged by the consistency of our interpretation of the actual results. The space-time experx- mental arrangement is merely a convenience: it is not an essential part of the theory. In this particular instance, we have been able to translate or, better, interpret a classificatory theory in terms of the space-time theory underlying the experiment. This is not, nor need it always be, the case. The numerical calculation, the mathe- matics, belongs to the theory of the experiment, not to the theory to be tested. 4 I want to sum up the argument. When we compare physics and biology, then we must take care to choose appropriate theories, 10o7</page><page sequence="8">ERNEST H. HUTTEN that is, theories of the same level of 'abstraction'. In physics as well, there exist simple theories that are classificatory rather than causal (in the ordinary sense of this term). Such theories are concerned, as are the corresponding ones in biology, with genuine processes, creation and destruction. The theories are not very mathematical and seem intrinsically unsuitable for an advanced formal treatment. The theories are not aiming at predicting an event m space-time; they are tested by their coherence or integrative power. Morphology and genetics, instead, replace, so to speak, the space and time relations of the entity described by the theory. Royal Holloway College Surrey lo8</page></plain_text>
