Vol. 2: The Rise of Urban Concepts in the Ancient Near East Yosef Garfinkel and David Ben-Shlomo The second of the final ex cavation reports on the Neolithic site of Shacar Hagolan in the Jordan Valley of Israel presents and analyses the architecture and stratigraphy of the site. The revolutionary discoveries at this ma jor settlement have completely altered our under standing of the sixth millennium BCE and shed new light on the rise of urban concepts in the an cient Near East.

Vol. 3: Symbolic Dimensions of the Yarmukian Culture: Canonization in Neolithic Art Yosef Garfinkel, David Ben-Shlomo and Naomi Korn The third of the final excavation reports on Shacar Hagolan presents the entire assemblage of clay and stone figurative art from the site. Detailed analysis reveals that most of the figurines, re gardless of their raw materials, portray a specific anthropomorphic figure. The same figure is en countered in representations at all other Yarmukian sites, from Byblos in the north to cAin Ghazal in the east. This clearly reflects shared symbolic expression throughout the large terri tory of the Yarmukian culture. The book was pub lished in 2010 by Israel Exploration Society and the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew Uni versity of Jerusalem. 404 pages; 34 colour plates; size 24 31 cm.; hard cover.
