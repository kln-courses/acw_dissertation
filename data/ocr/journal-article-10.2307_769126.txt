<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONWY LLOYD MORGAN 1852-1936 CONwY LLOYD MORGAN was born in London on 6 February, 1852, the second son ofJ. A. Morgan, a solicitor. He died at Hastings on 6 March, 1936. He received his early education at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, where he came under the influence of a distinguished classical scholar, Dr. Merriman. From school he went to the Royal School of Mines with a view to becoming an engineer. Here he was Duke of Cornwall Scholar, Murchison and de la Beche Medallist, finally taking his diploma in mining and metallurgy. It was here, therefore, that he laid the sound foundations of his knowledge of geology. He was not, however, destined to become either an engineer or a pure geologist. At the School of Mines he had come into contact with T. H. Huxley, who was doubtless responsible for awakening in him an interest in biology. He read Darwin's Voyage of a Naturalist, and himself spent several months in a tour through North America and Brazil. On his return he made an intensive study of biology under Huxley at South Kensington, where he had Bastian, already an ardent exponent of abiogenesis, as a fellow student. In 1878 he obtained the post of lecturer at the Diocesan College, Rondebosch, near Capetown, and for five years taught physical science, English literature, and constitutional history. Here he gained experience in teaching. The work may not have been very congenial, but his leisure was spent in investigating the geology and natural history of his new home. In 1883 he was appointed lecturer in University College, Bristol, to which institution he remained attached for the remainder of his pro- fessional life. He succeeded W. J. Sollas as Lecturer on Geology and Zoology. In 1887 he succeeded Sir William Ramsay as Principal of the College. When, in 1910, the College obtained its charter as a university he became acting Vice-Chancellor until the appointment of Sir Isambard Owen. During these years much of his time was taken up with admini- strative work, and it was with relief that he was again enabled to devote himself to teaching and research as first Professor of Psychology and Ethics. He held this chair until his retirement in 1919 at the age of sixty-seven. His years of retirement were by no means sterile, for during them he elaborated his philosophical ideas in the Gifford Lectures delivered at St. Andrews.</page><page sequence="2">9n0` 1~ .B ,1 9:. d, r; =, . jr%: .1 ; kr :r c:?:.trra 1I;Y, I; cU r . h h r: .,,,,,. i Ir n i ~5~C~~ g~Eag?";A S ? ?L~ 1?2\ : 4;~~3~it~-; i" B ::; ~' ? &amp;3 i:i rls~ss;sa ?~t`~i~L~a~~:~~ :"- .' i ~,~ta~;?I?: ?r\ " ~?- t~ :~:z ?\?a ~ ~"i ~sla~~:?~? ?:%: .? kd ? ~6" ` ~-~~: [1~ "~c~F~e~d " /~ ~ /A/A/r~f /Lc/t C</page><page sequence="3">26 Obituary Notices Lloyd Morgan's interest in philosophy began early in his life. Whilst a student at the School of Mines he read Berkeley's Principles and Hume's Enquiry at the instigation of the rector of Weybridge, a friend of his father's. It cannot be doubted that Huxley's agnostic, yet profoundly philosophic, outlook made a lasting impression on his mind. Unlike most philosophers, his views were based on exceptionally varied, yet precise, scientific foundations and experience. As a well-trained chemist, geologist, biologist, and psychologist, he was uniquely fitted to take a broad synoptic view of the problems of life and mind-a view cathartically controlled by scientific doubt. As he used to tell his students, meta- physics implies after physics. Lloyd Morgan was a voluminous writer. His Animal Biology (1887) was a student's text-book, filling a felt need. His Springs of Conduct; an Essay in Evolution (1885), Psychology for Teachers (1895), Introduction to Comparative Psychology ,(1895), Habit and Instinct (1896), Animal Behaviour (1900), and Instinct and Experience (1912) embodied his views on psychology and described the original work on comparative psychology which is his greatest scientific achievement. During his earlier days in Bristol he made a prolonged series of investi- gations on birds (chicks, ducklings, moorhens, etc.) with a view to segregating so far as possible the innate and acquired factors in their early behaviour. Hatched in an incubator and isolated from possible parental and other tuition, their behaviour under precise experimental conditions was observed, recorded, and finally explained with a minimum of anthropomorphic interpretation. Thus the transition from purely reflex activities to more complex and instinctive modes of behaviour, based upon innate anatomical and physiological dispositions, and the impact upon these of lessons derived from experience, leading to more intelligent responses through modification of the relatively plastic neurological substrata, unmasked some of the fundamental relationships between instinct and intelligence. His walks over the Downs with his dog, a stick, and a ball were the occasions for further investigations on the same problem. Upon these foundations, doubtless influenced, too, by Wundt's theory of creative evolution and by Bergson, Lloyd Morgan built up a philosophy of Emergent Evolution, which was elaborated in his Gifford Lectures and is embodied in his Emergent Evolution (1923), Life, Mind, and Spirit (1926), Mind at the Crossways (1929), The Animal Mind (1930), and The Emergence of Novelty (1933). According to this philosophical theory, evolution is not a steady continuous process, but is continually interrupted by the emergence of something new-something which cannot be</page><page sequence="4">Conwy Lloyd Morgan 27 immediately deduced from pre-existent data. Thus, atoms unite to form molecules, the properties of which cannot be immediately deduced from those of the constituent atoms ; solutions form crystals, and so on. There are many levels of emergent evolution, but these can be grouped, if only for methodological purposes, into three chief levels: A, the physical level ; B, the level of life ; and C, the level of consciousness. Events at each higher level involve and depend upon concurrent events at lower levels. Physico-chemical interrelations govern events at the level of matter, A. Physiological interrelations govern events at the level of life, B, but physiological events involve and depend upon physico- chemical events. Similarly, conscious events at level C (mind) involve and depend upon physiological events, themselves involving and dependent upon physico-chemical events. " No C without B, and no B without A. No mind without life, and no life without 'a physical basis '." It would also appear that we must accept " with natural piety " that, when some new kind of relatedness is supervenient, the course of events at a lower level may be altered. " Events of the kind we labelled C involve events of the kind we labelled B; and these in turn involve A-events. But in any given concrete case the specific way in which the A-events run their course, then and there, depends on the specific presence of some phase of vital B-relatedness ; and similarly the specific way in which these B-events run their course- in behaviour, for example-depends on such conscious C-relatedness as may be present " ; i.e., consciousness is " effective ". It is unnecessary to follow Lloyd Morgan, companioned by S. Alexander, into the more disputable realms of metaphysics. The chief value of emergent evolution is its function as a scientific method : like agnosticism, it clearly segregates and labels what is known and what is unknown. Lloyd Morgan's greatest contribution to science is in the realm of experi- mental psychology, in the investigation of the relatedness of psychical events to the underlying neurological events. Lloyd Morgan was a born teacher-a fluent lecturer, yet meticulously accurate in all his statements. Teaching must, in fact, have been almost a mania with him, for the present writer once came across him in the open air on Clifton Down lecturing to whoever wished to hear him on the somewhat remote subject of atolls ! His commanding presence and distinguished personality were wedded to an innate courtesy and sympathetic friendliness. J. H. PARSONS.</page></plain_text>
