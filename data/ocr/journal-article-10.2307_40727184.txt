At the same time his creative reinterpretation of Chinese philosophy ranks him as one of the greatest philosophers of contemporary China. Feng Youlan inherited the anti-religious rationalist spirit of the "May Fourth" Movement, but his views about religion can hardly be understood apart from his wider concern with the development of the Chinese philosophical tradition. In particular, two closely related concerns preoccupied Feng throughout his aca- demic life. First, there is the problem of the interrelation between the cultures of China and the West; second, Feng sought to offer a rational interpretation and reconstruction of traditional Chinese thought by means of Western philosophical reasoning. On this hermeneutical path, as the present paper will show, he came to represent Chinese philosophy as both "this- worldly" and "other-worldly," i.e., equally concerned with social and moral duties and with the search for transcendent values. Science, Religion, and Philosophy - East and West From the beginning of his doctoral studies at Columbia University in the early 1920s, Feng was deeply concerned with the problems of the future of the Chinese philosophical tradition and its relationship with the secular and religious thought</page><page sequence="2">324 Alexander V. Lomanov of the West. In his 1922 article "Why China Has No Science" he draws a sharp contrast between an inward-looking Chinese culture of "intension" and the West- ern preoccupation with "extension." Explaining this contrast, he emphasizes the link between the European scientific spirit and Christian culture. By Feng's as- sessment, whereas Christian medieval Europe was searching for the good and happiness in Heaven above, the ancient Greeks and the modern Europeans looked to the earth in order to gain happiness through understanding and master- ing the natural world. Both approaches are equally different from the Chinese inwardly-directed cognition in search of eternal peace and harmony within the human mind.1 What brings the different strands of Western culture together, from its Greco- Roman beginnings to medieval Christian and modern European thought, accord- ing to Feng, is an outward "art" orientation of knowledge and action. Feng praises Roman Stoicism as an element of the "natural" line of inward God- searching in European culture. Christianity redirected human concerns towards an external deity. Consequently, human beings were regarded as sinful, non-self- sufficient, and in need of an external agent to help them obtain wisdom and per- fection. In this way, Feng considers almost all aspects of European civilization - science, technology, society, state, law, morals and the Christian idea of a per- sonal God - as "artificial," external "props" for a weak, powerless and imperfect human nature.2 In his younger years Feng Youlan was already keenly aware of the impor- tance of the Christian doctrine of an eternal and absolute God, identified with the good, and the concomitant idea that evil is a negation of the good. He recognized that this notion is very close to the basic human aspiration towards goodness, and despite all the attacks from science the idea of God is still very important in Western culture. This renders the reconciliation of science and religion a crucial philosophical problem in the modern age.3 In his doctoral thesis Feng regarded philosophy as an expression of the ideal of the good. From this standpoint relig- ion appears to be rather close to philosophy, because both are able to provide some idea of the good as well as practical guidance for human behavior. Christi- anity has its own ideal of the good, and for Feng the modern attempts to recon- cile science and religion reflect a strong interest in defending the objective exis- 1 Feng Youlan, Zhongguo zhexueshi bu ^Siï'SiÈffi (Shanghai: Shanghai shangwu, 1936), p. 35.

Viewed in this light, Feng came to see religion as a "stereotyped" philosophy, burdened by authority, dogmas, and formality. Many of his attitudes had changed since the early 1920s, but the rationalistic interpretation of the Western notion of a theology of revelation remained in his works until the end of his life. God is not revealed in mystery and glory, but is "artificially constructed" by the human mind as an almighty "assistant" for its own purposes of cognition and exploration of the world. Like many other Chi- nese scholars, Feng Youlan was not satisfied with the Christian anthropology of the fall and of sin. Why was such an "artificial" God "constructed"? Would it not be easier and more pragmatic for the Europeans to follow the Greek anthro- pocentric heritage without proclaiming themselves sinners and without having to search for any transcendent redemption? Feng did not address these issues. He was more concerned with the fundamental opposition between the external, "artificial" paradigm of Christianity (or any other monotheistic religion) and the internal, "natural" wisdom of self-perfection. This basic claim is very important to an understanding of Feng Youlan' s later ideas. Concerned with the relationship between Chinese and Western culture, Feng thus regards the separation between philosophy and religion as a demarcation between the two cultures. He proclaims that "in the world of the future, man will have philosophy in place of religion."5 More precisely, in the West religion is doomed to be replaced by science, thereby depriving human beings of any access to higher spiritual values. This translates into a challenging global mission for Chinese thought. There is no real alternative to the Western scientific worldview. The religious outlook simply could not be harmonized with scientific data. As a result, religious sentiments are declining. But this does not mean that spiritual values are therefore no longer necessary. Only a rational, philosophical rectifica- tion of concepts about the transcendent can help protect human culture from the void of scientism. The decline of religion seems irreversible to Feng, but philo- sophical reconstruction can help humankind to anchor their moral values firmly in the realm of the transcendent. Till the last years of his academic life in the 1980s, Feng Youlan was still greatly concerned with the rational scientific dimension of the human spirit. Up to the end, he treated science and religion as two irreconcilable opponents, and his trust in the progress of human knowledge directly influenced his low evalua- tion of religion. Feng writes, 4 ibid., p. 248. 5 Feng Youlan, A Short History of Chinese Philosophy (New York: The Free Press, 1966), p. 6.</page><page sequence="4">326 Alexander V. Lomanov In the process of progress of humankind, religion and science are opposites (duili fij£). This is because religion is inseparable from superstitions, whereas science is most of all against superstitions. Philosophy and science can use each other as "function-application" (yong ^}). The development of philosophy is based on science; philosophy is not able to solve scientific problems, but it draws inspiration from science. Although science is also unable to solve philosophical problems, its inspiration can help philosophy to solve its problems. But it is necessary to transform its thought into "reflection." Generally, science can increase human positive knowledge, but is unable to elevate the human sphere. Philosophy can elevate the hu- man sphere, but is unable to increase human positive knowledge. Philoso- phy and science can use each other as "function-application," but philoso- phy and religion cannot use each other as "function-application."6 Both the religious and the old metaphysical views of the world have been shown to be false by modern science. But religious traditions and institutions have deep roots and remain resistant and, indeed, hostile to change. Philosophy, in contrast, is shaped by the human intellect, free from the weight of tradition or institution; so it is much more plausible to construct a philosophical account of transcen- dence, one which takes rationalism as its foundation but without sacrificing its spiritual depth. This path to a non-religious, philosophical spirituality is outlined by Feng Youlan in his program of a modern interpretation of the Chinese philo- sophical tradition. The Two Wings of Contemporary Confucianism: New lixue and New xinxue In his metaphysical system of "New lixue" {xinlixue fríHI), formulated in the late 1930s-1940s, Feng turned to Zhu Xi's 3^ (1130-1200) Neo-Confiician "School of Principle" {lixue) for a rationalistic reading of the tradition of philo- sophical objectivism in Chinese philosophy.7 In order to make Chinese culture 6 Feng Youlan, Sansongtang zixu mfô^êií [An Autobiography from the Hall of Three Pines] (Beijing: Sanlian, 1984), p. 269. The system of "New lixue" is expounded in complete form in the so called "six books" written by Feng Youlan from late 1937 to the mid- 1940s. Each book deals with a separate problem within the same philosophical and methodological framework: a general outline can be found in Xinlixue ^rS'S [New Teaching of Principle-Universal] (Changsha, 1939); social philosophy is treated in Xinshilun ^f^fra [Discussion of New Affairs] (Shanghai, 1939); an outline of public morals in Xinshixun $fftftS l| [Admonition to a New Generation] (Shanghai, 1940); the history of Chinese philosophy in Xinyuandao ^fJflÎË [New (Discourse) on the Original Dao] ([Chongqing,] 1945); anthropological views in Xinyuanren 0tJ5KÀ [New (Discourse) on Origi- nal Humanity] (Shanghai, 1946); and methodology in Xinzhiyan íff£D|| [New Words on Knowledge] (Shanghai, 1946). The "six books" of "New lixue" have recently been reprinted in volumes 4 and 5 of Feng Youlan' s Sansongtang quanji Hfò^^rA [Complete Collection (of Works) from the Hall of Three Pines] (Zhengzhou: Henan renmin, 1985-1994).</page><page sequence="5">Religion and Rationalism in the Philosophy of Feng Youlan 327 stronger and to supplement its "humanist-inward" orientation with a "scientific- outward" direction, Feng Youlan synthesized Zhu Xi's "quasi-Western" notions of rational knowledge of objective and absolute world principles (// ï§) with Western philosophical methods and concepts. Remarkably, Feng's New lixue seeks to offer a new metaphysics on the basis of only one fundamental synthetic proposition. Vulnerable as it may seem to philosophical criticism, Feng was convinced that all the metaphysical world principles (such as absolute norms, actual substance, the process of actualization and totality) can be deduced from one initial synthetic proposition about reality: namely, "Something exists" (you mou zhong shiwu ^^fi^j). From this, Feng Youlan proceeded to build a new account of Chinese philosophy, by reformulating such central Neo-Confucian categories as universais ("principle" // H), substratum (qi M), the process-em- bodiment of the Dao (daoti jËli)&gt; and the all-embracing Totality of the Great Whole (daquan -fcft). As Feng understands it, Western metaphysics (xingshangxue 1&amp;±M) is very broad in scope and discusses both abstract ideas "above [the realm of] shapes" (xing'ershang Jf^M±) and concrete objects "within shapes" (xing'erxia ft^MT). Technically, only genuine metaphysical objects should be left in the sphere of a New lixue, leaving no room for religious concepts which in Feng's estimation are inseparable from the world of shape and form. In particular, among the concepts that ought to be kept out of metaphysics, Feng refers to the idealist notion of "the universe's mind-heart" or, objective universal spirit. This separation is logical and not axiological: The value of what is within shapes could not be low just because it is within shapes. Take the example of the religious claim about God's creative action. This God, if He exists (you ^f), is within shapes.8 Later in his career, Feng Youlan made a further distinction between philosophical and rationalist values. The former can be seen in the love of God in Spinoza which is a real super-moral value, while the latter is exemplified by the love of God in Christianity which is only a quasi super-moral value.9 Due to his rationalistic hermeneutics of the Chinese philosophical tradition, Feng was skeptical about the claims of Wang Yangming's BcMtift (1472-1529) Neo-Confucian "School of Mind" (xinxue 'OH). In his search for a philosophical synthesis of China and the West and in order to create a modern reading of the Chinese tradition, Feng Youlan concentrated on Zhu Xi's rationalistic intellectual program of gewu zhizhi fê^g(£D, commonly translated as the "extension of knowledge" (zhizhi) through the "investigation of things" (gewu). There is little 8 Feng Youlan, Xinlixue, ch. 1, sec. 5; in Sansongtang quanji, vol. 4 (1986), pp. 36-37.

Lomanov attention to Wang Yangming's notion of extension of moral intuition (zhi liangzhi Ifcllfcn) of the absolute subjective mind. The key concept of xinxue, the mind- heart (xin '(», seems to have been left outside the basic categories of his ontol- ogy. This rationalist pursuit makes Feng's thought not only different from, but also sometimes opposed to the well-known mainstream Xiong Shili ti+^j (1885- 1968) - Mou Zongsan ^H (1909-1995) School of twentieth-century Confu- cianism. The programmatic statement of this school is contained in The Manifesto of Chinese Culture to the People of the World {Wei Zhongguo wenhua jinggao shijie renshi xuanyan M^Wi^ít^ÊiÈ^AztlítS, 1958), signed by Mou Zong- san, Zhang Junmai M^W) (1887-1968), Xu Fuguan ffîgfà (1903-1982) and Tang Junyi JM%%*. (1909-1978). 10 The four, certainly the most distinguished among Chinese scholars who left the mainland after 1949, rejected the inter- pretation of Chinese culture made by the Post-Ricci European Christian mis- sionaries, maintaining that it is wrong to regard Chinese culture as a non- religious one which concentrated solely on interhuman relationships and the social order. These scholars emphasized that the basic source of Confucian spirituality is the idea of the "unity of man and Heaven"; they proposed a spiritual and religious reading of the Chinese moral metaphysics of "learning of the mind-heart and nature-character" (xinxing zhi xue 'l&gt;f£;¿#í). The principal lineage of intellectual succession of this group is clearly to be traced to the liang- zhi-^u spirituality of Wang Yangming's xinxue School of Neo-Confucianism. Supporters of the New xinxue evidently stand opposed to Feng's assumption that Confucianism cannot be considered a religion and that the Chinese in their traditional outlook are not religious but rather philosophical.11 A great divide separates Feng's rationalistic, "analytical metaphysics" from the "moral meta- physics" of subjective spirituality of the Xiong Shili - Mou Zongsan School. But it would be a mistake to say that Feng's metaphysics does not belong to contem- porary Confucianism, just as it would be wrong to say that the objective rational- ity of Zhu Xi's lixue is not an integral part of classical Neo-Confucianism. Both xinxue and lixue, both Wang Yangming's and Zhu Xi's systems of thought, are important and organic parts of the Neo-Confucian tradition. Their mutual polem- ics does not depreciate any of the two schools but only highlights the subtle and internal dynamics of their teachings. The same applies to contemporary Confu- cianism. 10 An English translation under the title, "A Manifesto for a Re-appraisal of Sinology and Recon- struction of Chinese Culture" can be found in Carsun Chang, The Development of Neo-Confu- cian Thought (New York: Bookman Associates, 1962), vol. 2. 1 ' Feng Youlan, A Short History of Chinese Philosophy, pp. 3-4.</page><page sequence="7">Religion and Rationalism in the Philosophy of Feng Youlan 329 In the late 1980s, Feng Youlan stated that the philosophical division between lixue and xinxue reflects a universal intellectual phenomenon: Originally in philosophy there are these two trends. In Western philosophy Plato and Aristotle are the representatives of lixue, while Kant and Hegel are the representatives of xinxue. There are also the same two trends in the Chinese philosophy of the modernization period, called New lixue and New xinxue. 12 It is true that Feng's New lixue belongs to the "subsidiary" trend of contempo- rary Confucian thought. He may not have subscribed to the dominant New xinxue, the mainstream of contemporary Confucianism, but it does not mean that Feng Youlan is not a Confucian thinker. Since the 1940s, New xinxue advocates have been questioning the correctness of Feng's interpretation of Chinese philosophy, a criticism that is aggravated by their dislike of Feng's shifting political and ideological views in post- 1949 main- land China. Similarly one could hardly find any references to the New xinxue in Feng's works until the late 1980s. In the seventh volume of The New Edition of the History of Chinese Philosophy (the last book in his life dictated in 1989-1990) he gave for the first time an account of the philosophical ideas of his intellectual rival Xiong Shili. In this book Feng included under the rubric of New lixue his own work and Jin Yuelin's #éíJ (1896-1984) "Metaphysics of Dao" (both created in the late 1930s). Xiong Shili and Liang Shuming ^itïl (1893-1988) are labeled as "representatives of xinxue in the contemporary Chinese revolution- ary epoch."13 Because the study of contemporary Confucianism is still in its infancy, there is no uniform terminology in either Chinese or Western sources. We could name the Xiong Shili - Mou Zongsan School of New xinxue, the New Neo-Confu- cianism, while Feng's New lixue may be described as Post-Confucianism. These names are disputable; but the former brings into view a greater coherence with the classical Neo-Confucian tradition of "inner learning," while the latter helps reveal significant features of New lixue, such as its openness to Western thought, its less conservative and more creative hermeneutical reading of tradi- tion, and its insistence on clear and logical reasoning. It is important to empha- size, however, that both the mainstream "New Neo-Confucianism" and the less influential Post-Confucianism form an organic and indispensable part of the global whole of Contemporary Confucianism. 12 Feng Youlan, Zhongguo xiandai zhexueshi ^SÍS ft®!^ [A History of Chinese Contempo- rary philosophy] (Xianggang: Zhonghua, 1992), p. 181. 13 Ibid., p. 226.</page><page sequence="8">330 Alexander V. Lomanov Religion and Post-Confucian Metaphysics From an analysis of Feng Youlan's metaphysics one could get a deeper under- standing of the Post-Confucian rationalist impact on the interpretation of Confu- cian spirituality. Feng's moral and anthropological teaching is based upon the ontological and epistemological foundations of the New lixue and represents an attempted Confiician-Daoist-Buddhist synthesis. The moral and transcendent elevation of the human mind is conditioned by the human ability to attain an un- derstanding of the principles (li) underlying objective reality. Through a "self- conscious understanding" (juejie j£#P) of the most fundamental principles-uni- versals of nature, society, humanity and the universe at large, an individual could gradually elevate his/her mind to the highest spiritual sphere. The deeper the human understanding of the meaning of reality, the higher the spiritual sphere he/she reaches. More specifically, the lower natural (ziran jingjie '=ii$Mifr) and utilitarian spheres (gongli jingjie 5&amp;fiJiJ£|^) are the gifts of nature. They are simple and do not constitute sufficient ground for moral motivation. The higher moral sphere (daode jingjie ílfêít^-) is a product of individual self-cultivation and finds ex- pression in communal values and non-selfish action that "benefits others." The highest "Sphere of Heaven and Earth" or the "universal sphere" (tiandi jingjie ^ itfeítJW attributes to the human mind not only the values of the social life-world, but brings into view being in its entirety. This sphere is a "transmoral" or "super-moral" one. Feng is careful to describe his metaphysical teaching as "empty" and "practi- cally useless"; but it serves to give fresh meaning to the idea of "sagehood" as a silent and joyful union with the wholeness of being in the universal sphere of mind. This union, based on both philosophical penetration and self-perfection in society, is different from the Daoist ideal of simplicity and naturalness. At the highest level of development, the mind transcends the world of particulars and becomes one with the universal "totality of all that is."14 The realization that the self forms an organic part of the boundless transformation (dahua -fcit) of the world brings also a "new vision" of the universe, which can be articulated in terms of such Neo-Confiician metaphysical concepts as the normative principle- universal (//), the notion of dynamic process (daoti) and the all-embracing Total- ity of the Great Whole (daquan). Feng compares this with what Spinoza called a vision of the world sub speciem aeternitatis .15 From this perspective, it is easy to understand why Feng regarded religion as an incomplete understanding of the universe. Ultimately, it is his determination to 14 Feng Youlan, A Short History of Chinese Philosophy, p. 2. 15 Feng Youlan, Xinyuanren, ch. 7; Sansongtang quanji, vol. 4 (1986), p. 625.</page><page sequence="9">Religion and Rationalism in the Philosophy of Feng Youlan 331 provide the Chinese philosophical tradition with a rational foundation that led him to question the validity of religious thinking in the modern world. The religious believer, in Feng's estimation, relies on "imagination" (xiang M) but lacks the power of philosophic "thought" (si jg). The philosopher realizes that the relig- ious concept of a super-human force (deity) is nothing but an "unclear and inco- herent" cognition of the universe, that the idea of heavenly paradise is an "un- clear and incoherent" notion of the world of abstract principles (//), and that creation is an "unclear and incoherent" concept of the world's dynamic processes (daoti)}6 In this regard, the religious understanding of the world points to some of the ideas of New lixue in an "unclear and incoherent" form and is thus connected to a certain extent with a rationalistic picture of the universe. There is some truth to religion, but it is necessary to present this truth in a complete and perfect meta- physical form. This is but another way of saying that "in the heart of every great religion there is a philosophy," albeit burdened "with a certain amount of super- structure, which consists of superstitions, dogmas, rituals, and institutions."17 This suggests that Feng Youlan's own line of interpretation can be formulated as a rationalist "purification" of knowledge. Feng's ideal of the "most philosophical metaphysics" can be described both as a religion without superstitions, dogmas, rituals and institutions or as a science without any synthetic positive verifiable propositions about the objects of the actual world. It is clear that Feng Youlan regarded all religious concepts to be the projec- tions of human properties, powers and institutions. Non-rational imaginary relig- ious thinking produces an anthropomorphic image of the divine. God has knowl- edge like a human being, but it is conceived as complete omniscience. Similarly, the limited power that human beings possess is turned into divine omnipotence. God has will, but unlike the human will his will is completely good. Conse- quently, God's creativity is simply borrowed from human artisanship. The im- ages of paradise and Heaven are rooted in concrete features of this world; the only difference is that real sufferings have been omitted and replaced with infinite joy. In short, "the so-called deity is nothing but a boundless enlargement of hu- man individuality. The so called paradise is nothing but an idealization of this world."1 It is not hard to see that Feng's view is very close to and probably di- rectly influenced by the ideas of the German philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach (1804-1872), whose notion of projection was a source of inspiration for Marxist atheism. In Feng Youlan's system there is little place for the idea of communica- tion between the divine and humankind. From a rationalist perspective, divine 16 ibid.

Lomanov transcendence can be easily "explained" as a simple projection of the immanence of humanity, thus dismissing any notion of God's mysterious presence in the phenomenal world. To illustrate where religion stands in relation to the various levels of "self- conscious understanding" in New lixue metaphysics, Feng gives the example of the different motivation that a person may have in founding a hospital. If the do- nor is moved by possible fame and/or profit, he or she is operating essentially within the "utilitarian" sphere of mind. If this person is motivated by the desire to serve the community and to "exercise righteousness" (xingyi frêl)&gt; his/her mind belongs to the moral sphere. But if the motivation is purely religious, then neither self-interest nor the interest of community is served, but rather that of the divine. Feng describes this state of mind as a "quasi-universal" sphere and em- phasizes that the motivation should be genuine and pure. If the person is moti- vated by the goal of obtaining the deity's mercy for himself, his seemingly charitable act would not be any different from one of personal profit-seeking, and his mind would remain at the instrumentalist utilitarian level. The religious mind, in the final analysis, may be said to belong to the moral sphere, above the utilitarian sphere, but nonetheless below the universal one. Su- pernatural beings are but human projections; they are provided with some human individuality and they together cohabit in an "other-worldly" community. Insofar as the cardinal feature of the moral consciousness is the selfless serving of soci- ety, the religious mind is moral: Under God there are many other spirits or deities (shen fâ) with human characteristics, constituting a community all together. For example, in Christianity God is the Father, Jesus is the Son, and there are also many other deities who have human personalities (you renge di shen ÍFÀfêÊtt), like John, Paul and the others. All together they form a community. A Christian believer imagines in his vivid thinking such a community, thinks of himself as a member of this community and serves it. With this imagination his actions are moral and his sphere is a moral one. However, the community which he serves is not real but an imaginary one.19 Feng's understanding of religion has not undergone any significant change over the years. Indeed, his anti-religious stance seems only to have hardened. The same rationalist themes are clearly evident in his "Autobiography," which ap- peared in 1984, forty years after he first developed the principles of New lixue and the idea of the universal sphere of mind. Since the highest level of human "self-conscious understanding" could only be reached through philosophical cognition, the fundamental differences between philosophy and religion must be maintained. In particular, Feng identified four major distinctions between phi- 19 Ibid., p. 627.</page><page sequence="11">Religion and Rationalism in the Philosophy of Feng Youlan 333 losophy and religion. First, religion is based on superstitions and is inseparable from them. "The myths of a primitive society are certainly superstitions; the God of monotheistic religion is also a superstition. Philosophy respects reason (lizhi M H?); it is against superstitions."20 Second, religion uses imaginary thinking which creates illusory images like the Jade Emperor or God the Creator, while the tool of philosophy is theoretical thinking. Third, the illusory religious world is modeled on human social organization, whereas philosophy aims at a world model created by the human spirit. Fourth, the level of spiritual attainment of religious believers is typically low: for Feng, while some may be at the level of the utilitarian sphere seeking personal protection from religion, others may be on the even lower level of the natural sphere due to their unconscious conformist participation in religious rituals.21 Feng recalled in his "Autobiography" a meeting with the American philoso- pher John Dewey (1859-1952), his former teacher at Columbia University, dur- ing his 1947 visit to the United States: Dewey told us that the religious tendency in America is a leading force. He said that one wealthy old lady told a Catholic bishop once: "If you can guarantee that after my death my soul would certainly be saved, I will do- nate all my property to the Church." The bishop replied that it is certainly guaranteed, and the old lady took that for truth and donated all her property to the Church. When he said that, we [the delegation of academics from the Qinghua yjfSji University] could not help laughing.22 As Feng reflects further, That old lady put all her hopes in religion. This shows that her spiritual sphere was empty and she did not find a spiritual land of "calming the self and establishing life" (anshen liming -£%ÌLn'ì). In this aspect philosophy could substitute religion and actually Chinese philosophy has substituted re- ligion.23 Contemporary Western philosophers, typically concentrating on small profes- sional issues, are to a certain extent responsible for the neglect of the important problems of human spiritual life. The more Western philosophers are preoccu- pied with narrow, specialized research problems, according to Feng Youlan, the less they could say anything meaningful about the "great principles of human life." 20 Feng Youlan, Sansongtang zixu, pp. 268-269. 21 Ibid., p. 269. 22 /¿7/V/., p. 123. 23 Ibid.</page><page sequence="12">334 Alexander V. Lomanov Philosophy is originally responsible to solve this great problem [of 'calming the self and establishing life']. Philosophers are forgetting the duty of philo- sophy and giving away to religion the problems which should be solved by philosophy.24 It is also significant that in his theory of China's national modernization, Feng Youlan criticizes the attempts to bring Christianity to China. The propagation of Christianity belongs to the idea of "Westernization" (xiyanghua jS#fl:), while what China needs is modernization: Protestantization or Catholicization certainly is not modernization, but we cannot say that it is not Westernization. However, the majority of those who emphasize Westernization do not emphasize Protestantization or Catholici- zation, or even speak against this "transformation" (hua f fc), they still often use the terms which point to this "transformation."25 Commenting on Kang Youwei's M^JÊ (1858-1927) "movement for a native Confucian religion to counteract the growing impact of the West," Feng admits that historically it was prepared by the ideas of the New Text School of the Han dynasty. But the claim to present Confucius as a deity was groundless in the times of Han, and it is completely obsolete now, because, ... the twentieth century is not one of religion, and together with, or in ad- dition to, the introduction of Christianity into China, there also came mod- ern science, which is the opposite of religion. Thus the influence of Christi- anity per se has been limited in China, and the movement for a Confucian religion suffered an early death.26 Christianity is dismissed not only from Feng's plans of national modernization, but also from his reconstruction of Chinese philosophy in its preparation for the role of the "future world philosophy." This makes Feng's position very different, for example, from the views of his contemporary He Lin HÜ (1902-1989), who followed the New xinxue tradition. The latter contributed to contemporary Con- fucianism by proposing a synthesis of the best essential elements of Christianity with the Confucian "teaching of rituals" (lijiao IMSt). Against Feng Youlan, he argues that Christianity has contributed profoundly to Western spiritual life. For He Lin, the rise of modern Western culture would not have been possible without the synthesis of religion and science - i.e., without having taken the religious core as substance (ti ff) and the scientific exploration of the world as function 24 Ibid., p. 260. 25 Feng Youlan, Xinshilun, ch. 1; Sansongtang quanji, vol. 4 (1986), p. 225. 26 Feng Youlan, A Short History of Chinese Philosophy, p. 325.</page><page sequence="13">Religion and Rationalism in the Philosophy of Feng Youlan 335 (yong ffl). He Lin thus concludes that no new Confucian revival would be possi- ble without integrating the essence of Christianity.27 The Universal Sphere of the Mind Is Feng Youlan's Post-Confucian rationalism a completely atheistic one? Or are there some hidden religious features? Feng's New lixue is grounded in the Pla- tonic idea of the separation of the existing world of actuality (shiji ffßg) from the subsisting "true" world (zhenji ijpfO of absolute universais. At the first stage, positive analytical thinking could be very helpful in the construction of a clear, logical and coherent philosophical system. But at the metaphysical level, this rationalistic ontological synthesis of Plato (427-347 B.C.) with Zhu Xi cannot but be supplemented by a "negative" mystical epistemology of silence. Although the concepts of daoti and daquan are the products of strict logical reasoning, Feng also admits that human reason is not able to operate logically with metaphysical notions of totality. For this reason he turns from the Western "positive" analytical method to the Chinese "negative" method, combining Kant's (1724- 1804) epistemology of the "thing-in-itself" and some of Ludwig Wittgenstein's (1889-1951) ideas with a Daoist and Chan-Buddhist "philosophy of silence." In Feng's opinion, every true metaphysical system should start from a "positive method" and clear thinking, but ends in a "negative" or mystical contemplation of being. Analytic philosophy cannot rule out the Chinese mystical method, because the latter is dealing with "other-worldly" concepts and has a "super- rational" nature.28 New lixue metaphysics culminates in the notion of the mysterious universal sphere. From the philosophically intersubjective "knowing Heaven" (zhi Tian £p 55) to the subjective psychological and emotional experiences of "unification with Heaven" (tong Tian [W|^) and "delighting in Heaven" (le Tian fg^), the uni- versal sphere opens up a new range of human possibilities. It also entails a prac- tical turn, for individual action is now seen as "serving Heaven" (shi Tian ^^). The essential features of human "self-conscious understanding" on the level of its highest universal sphere seem rather similar to the conventional descriptions of the religious mind. The initial step of "knowing Heaven" means a conscious understanding of one's universal responsibilities. For the sage, all social duties are understood as universal duties, and moral actions are grounded not in social rules, but in heav- enly principles. The realization of this knowledge is "serving Heaven," which He Lin, "Rujia sixiang de xinkaizhan" M^SÍSWfrMS [New Development of Confucian Thought], in Rujia sixiang xinlun íñÜLSÍfi#Tlro [New Discussion on Confucian Thought] (1948; repr.

Lomanov Feng Youlan explains as "rendering assistance to transformation" (zanhua Rib). The sage participates in the great processes of the universal flow of transforma- tion, consciously assisting the actualization of principles (li) towards a complete realization of the nature (xing ft) of the universe. The profound understanding that things and events form a part of the universal totality or the "Great Ulti- mate" (taiji jsM) brings joy to the sage. "Unification with the Great Whole," finally, represents the climax of the universal sphere, where there is no more division between the ego {wo $0 and the external world of the non-ego {fei wo 1^3%). There is no more selfish ego, but only the universal ego, encompassing the entire universe. This universal ego is described by Feng Youlan as a "master" (zhuzai 2È$) of the whole universe, which calls to mind the Western Renaissance notion of "humanodeity": Religion takes God (Shangdi _h^) as the master of the universe. At the level of the universal sphere the individual perceives that his 'ego' is master of the universe. If the master of the universe is God, so the 'ego' [of the universal mind] is God.29 At the stage of "unity with Heaven," the sage is spiritually identified with the Great Whole, although his humanity remains intact. This is the sphere of Confu- cian "benevolence-humanity" {ren 'Z) or "sincerity" (cheng ¡$), where the "myriad of things are within me" and there is no opposition between subject and object. Epistemologically it is a mystical state of "knowledge and non-knowl- edge." The Great Whole is unthinkable, because any thought about totality as an object will split this totality into two, into the subject and object of cognition. Thus, the spiritual sphere of unity with the Great Whole is also unthinkable. Feng compares this with the Buddhist notion of the "true reality" {bhütatathata, Chin. zhenru jH#p) or the Daoist concept of the Dao?° This is a very significant comparison. Feng Youlan was not able to ignore or reject Buddhism or Daoism. He distinguished, however, the Buddhist and Daoist philosophical "school" (jia f0 sharply from the Buddhist and Daoist religion {jiao $0. Philosophical Daoism as a teaching of following nature is fundamen- tally opposed to the "antinatural" spirit of the religious Daoist search for immor- tality. Similarly, philosophical Buddhism is deemed superior to its religious form.31 Nonetheless, Feng also criticizes the Buddhist and Daoist philosophical schools for their approach to attaining unity with the Great Whole. A person should not be required to do anything unusual - monasticism, quiet-sitting, and more generally withdrawal from society are wrong, because they imply an op- 29 Feng Youlan, Xinyuanren, ch. 7, p. 637.

There should be no opposition on the way to sagehood. Feng praises especially the Neo-Con- ftician and Chan-Buddhist idea of merging self-perfection and spiritual elevation with normal participation in social life. Is Feng Youlan' s intellectual project religious? The problem of the definition of religion is an important one. In some contemporary Protestant theological cir- cles, religion has been interpreted so broadly that the Chinese tradition is now able to adopt their language to represent its own heritage both domestically and in intercultural dialogue. Specifically, Paul Tillich's (1886-1965) description of religiosity as "ultimate concern" (Chin, zhongji guanhuai UWMW. or zhongji guanqie ft&amp;MMW) has proved remarkably popular among Chinese scholars. This definition takes human experience as the beginning of spirituality, which matches perfectly the anthropocentric spirit of Chinese religiosity. Small wonder, then, that Tillich's definition has also been applied to Feng Youlan' s philosophy. The well-known mainland scholar Meng Peiyuan Wïêjt, for example, argues that Feng's concept of spiritual sphere centers on the idea of "calming the self and establishing life": The so-called anshen liming- (^Jf-^qp) question is what is taught in Chi- nese philosophy as "setting the human ultimate" (// renji ±LkW)* that is the realization of one's sphere, the completion of the human mission. In the language of contemporary philosophy, it is called "ultimate concern."32 According to Meng, Feng Youlan's teaching of the universal sphere has a "re- ligious meaning," but it is different from traditional religion on account of the absence of worship or faith. While recognizing Feng's rationalist stance, Meng concludes that although he did not "make any clear statement about the necessity of interpénétration between philosophy and religion," the notion of the universal sphere is a "real expression of a super-social, super-moral religious spirit."33 The search for the highest transcendent principle of being is an intrinsic fea- ture of metaphysics. Certainly, Feng's New lixue is highly metaphysical, but it does not necessarily follow that there is a religious spirit at its core. Moreover, the search for transmorality and transsociality could easily produce atheistic or anti-religious ideas, as in the case of the Nietzschean idea of the "death of God." Feng Youlan reserved an important place for moral and social values in his metaphysical system. The universal sphere of human "self-conscious understand- ing" of one's unity with the totality of being cannot be reached by evading the Meng Peiyuan, "Ping Feng Youlan de jingjieshuo" WMIfcWfì&amp;Jftìfo [Critical Discussion of Feng Youlan's Teaching about Spheres], in Feng Youlan xiansheng jinian lunwenji MfeffiJctÉ. %iï&amp;m3CM [A Collection of Articles in Commemoration of Feng Youlan] (Beijing: Beijing daxue, 1993), p. 273. 33 Ibid., p. 282.</page><page sequence="16">338 Alexander V. Lomanov moral sphere of selfless and self-conscious social participation in "benefiting oth- ers." Because of this the Chinese scholar Wang Zhongjiang ïE^I characterizes Feng's intention to reconcile the other-worldly pursuit of the "highest illumina- tion" with the this-worldly "following the Mean" in society as his "ultimate con- cern." Wang specifies that, from the viewpoint of the goal of practical realization, the ultimate concern of Feng's philosophy is explicitly the problem of human life (rensheng A:zfc)&gt; the problem of the elevation of the human spiritual sphere. His onto- logical view of the universe serves these [goals] and can be reduced to them.34 Significantly, the notion of "ultimate concern" is also applied by mainland schol- ars to the evaluation of Feng Youlan's spirit of "patriotism" or "cultural national- ism." For example, Chen Lai |^5j5 identifies Feng's nationalism and his desire to follow the fate of China in any situation as his greatest spiritual concern.35 De- veloping these ideas, we can suggest that Feng's rationalistic concern is directed to the totality of the nation, more than to the inner spirituality of the individual. Feng decided to go back to China just before the Communist takeover, while the majority of Confucian scholars left the mainland. In order to serve the Commu- nist plan of modernization, Feng rejected his former ideas and turned into a critic of tradition for several decades. This is consistent with his emphasis on the "emptiness" of universal principles (li). In contrast, building on the idea of an unchangeable human nature, "New Neo-Confucian" thinkers in Hong Kong and Taiwan were unanimously opposed to the Communist ideology and tried to pro- tect and develop traditional Chinese culture. Concluding Remarks: Feng Youlan and Liang Shuming Feng Youlan's New lixue metaphysics is designed to be empty and carries no postulates about objective or subjective reality. It is less contradictory than relig- ion or the old metaphysics. But is his system able to provide a real alternative to traditional religious spirituality? 34 Wang Zhongjiang, "'Ji gaoming er dao zhongyong' - lun Feng Youlan zhexue de zhongji guan- huai" mM^mm^m - mmMWi%mmmmm ["Attaining the Highest Illumination and Following the Mean": On the Ultimate Concern of Feng Youlan's Philosophy], in Feng Youlan xiansheng jinian lunwenji, p. 315. 35 Chen Lai, "Feng Youlan xiansheng zhongji guanhuai - xiansheng 1988 nian suozhuan zhi chan- jiu ftixin lian lüeshuo" IS&amp;MftaÚ&amp;WNlim - &amp;ÍÈ 1988 ^m«^ÍBSfflffWfêlA [Feng Youlan's Ultimate Concern: On the Inscription about "Explaining the Old, Promoting the New" made by him in 1988], mZhongguo wenhua ¿pWXit 4 (1991): 133-136.</page><page sequence="17">Religion and Rationalism in the Philosophy of Feng Youlan 339 In the 1940s Hong Qian ^M (1909-1992), a well-known Chinese expert in logic and disciple of Moritz Schlick (1882-1936), remarked that New lixue was constructed of "empty words" (konghua 3?§j§, Germ, sinnleer). The system ap- pears correct from the point of view of its relations with science and formal logic, but it dramatically lacks any emotional, human meaning.36 Feng's teaching about the human spheres tries to address this problem, but it seems inferior even to what the "bad old metaphysics" has to offer. The introduction of intuitive and mystical methods indirectly affirms the value of the non-rational cognition and runs into contradiction with the initial claims of his philosophy. Both the philosophical and cultural directions of Feng Youlan' s thought can be clarified through a comparison with the views of Liang Shuming. The "last Confucian" and the "first New Confucian" at the same time, Liang was an im- portant transition figure in modern Chinese thought. His ideas had exerted a strong impact on Chinese intellectuals, including Feng Youlan, in the first half of the 20th century. Religion, according to Liang Shuming, "seeks comfort and edification in the realm of emotion and the will (mou qingzhi fangmian zhi anwei xumian Wfëï&amp;Jj M^^WMjM) by transcending the objects of knowledge."37 He identified the "transcendent" (chaojue ág$g) and "mystical" (shenmi fâ%) as the basic charac- teristics of religion. Confucianism, however, "is not a religion, although it re- sembles religion" (fei zongjiao er si zongjiao iY^W(M{0MWÙ' This is because it is capable of solving the crucial problems of human spirituality without having to introduce ideas of a (Buddhist) transcendence of renouncing the world (chushi ttJtS). One can discern many similarities between Feng Youlan and Liang Shuming, and some of them may reflect direct influence of Liang's ideas on the former. First, the definition of Chinese spirituality as "attaining the highest illumina- tion and following the mean" (ji gaoming er dao zhongyong WSjBMWM^ÌE), which Feng developed in the 1940s, is already found in Liang's Dong-Xi wenhua ji qi zhexue ÄS^tSÄf?^ (1921) as a description of the harmony between 36 Hong Qian, "Lun xin lixue de zhexue fangfa" Wffifâ^fàfâVtfjfc [On the Philosophical Method of the "New lixue"], in Zhexue pin g lun g-gËfFU 10,2 (1946); repr. in Hong Qian, Weiyena xuepai zhexue W^Jff^WË^ [The Philosophy of the Vienna Circle] (Beijing, 1989).

Lomanov intuition and intellectual reflection in Chinese thought.38 Second, both rejected religion as a "wrong" path of "unclear" thinking. According to Liang Shuming, "Confucius was above all against unclear and confused thinking (husi luanxiang AEÍSaLÍIOj and typically all religions propound unclear and confused thought."39 Third, both scholars regarded Chinese culture as an essentially non-religious one. To Liang Shuming, Confucius was only a moral teacher. In the 17th century, the Chinese welcomed the Jesuit missionaries because of their knowledge in astron- omy, mathematics, physics, geography, biology and medicine, but not because of any interest in the "human aspects of their religion."40 Fourth, both saw the problem of religion as an issue of cultural interaction between China and the West. Liang Shuming clearly defined "the problem of religion as the watershed between the cultures of China and the West."41 Both Liang and Feng were con- cerned about the value crisis caused by the modern "retreat of religion" in West- ern culture, and sought to introduce elements of Chinese spirituality to a "Post- Christian" West. There are, of course, important differences between Liang Shuming and Feng Youlan as well. In his re interpretation of Confucian thought, Liang Shuming favored the xinxue tradition. Chinese "moral rationality" (lixing Bl'tt) is to be distinguished from the Western emphasis on the "intellect" (lizhi SU1)- Any at- tempt to search for "transcendence" and "other-worldliness," furthermore, must be discarded, for it only detracts from the fullness of the reality of being. While Liang championed the "substitution of religion by morality (daode jM$8),w Feng Youlan proposed to replace religion with philosophy. In his attempt to detach philosophical discourse from religion and to develop a rational philosophical system on Neo-Conftician grounds, Feng nevertheless found an important place not only for logical reasoning but for mystical "other-worldliness" as well. As Michel Masson has noted, these two types of discourse are not distin- guished in China as clearly as they have been in the West. The dispute between Feng's New lixue and contemporary xinxue is in effect a debate about the nature of Chinese thought - whether it is a "philosophy" in the Western sense or an expression of "faith" in the centrality of the mind.42 New lixue represents the most systematic and consistent masterpiece of professional philosophy in contem- 38 Ibid., p. 471.

But Feng Youlan's formal and rational approach to tran- scendence proves largely unappealing to Chinese intellectuals. He has no follow- ers, and Post-Confucianism fails to develop into a viable school of thought. A comparison between Feng Youlan and Liang Shuming clarifies some as- pects of the relationship between the contemporary versions of Confucian lixue and xirvcue. Liang's interpretation of lixing, which he regarded as the most fun- damental feature of Chinese thought, is much closer to the classical xirvcue notion of "moral intuition" (liangzhi) and very different from Feng's rationalistic claims. Yet, Liang Shuming and Feng Youlan share an important common ground in their critique of religion. This is important not only to an understand- ing of contemporary Confucianism, but also to the growing field of Confiician- Christian Dialogue in current intercultural discourse. Feng Youlan once wrote that the spiritual union with the totality of the uni- verse could make neither body nor spirit immortal, but it could lead to a "spiritual transcendence of death and life" (jingshen shang chao sisheng ff #± í§?EíÉ).43 Feng Youlan's colleague Tu Youguang fàJLit recalled that even towards the end of his life Feng never talked about death: "... his words did not touch death because there was no such word in his mind-and-heart. The teacher was a man who had transcended death and life."44 The central question of Feng's philosophy, as Tu Youguang also reminds us, is the question of the universal sphere of the human spirit. In this regard, Feng did not only leave behind a valuable philosophical legacy, but exemplified the universal sphere in his own life. 43 Feng Youlan, Xinyuanren, ch. 10.
