Paravasthu Wayne State Univ. Copyright 1996 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT A humerus provisional reference value (PRV) based on human surrogate data was developed to help evaluate upper arm injury potential. The proposed PRV is based on humerus bone bending moments generated by testing pairs of cadaver arms to fracture in three-point bending on an Instron testing machine in either lateral-medial (L-M) or anterior-posterior (A-P) loading, at 218 mm/s and 0.635 mm/s loading rates. The results were then normalized and scaled to 50th and 5th percentile sized occupants. The normalized average L-M bending moment at failure test result was 6 percent more than the normalized average A-P bending moment. The normalized average L-M shear force at failure was 23 percent higher than the normalized average A-P shear force. The faster rate of loading resulted in a higher average bending moment overall - 8 percent in the L- M and 14 percent in the A-P loading directions. The faster rate of loading gave 3 percent higher and 1 1 percent higher shear forces in the L-M and A-P directions respectively. The differences between the two loading rates and L-M and A-P directions however were not statistically significant. The proposed PRV for the 50th percentile occupant is Fx = Fy = 2.5 kN and Mx = My = 230 N-m. The proposed PRV for the 5th percentile occupant is Fx = Fy = 1.7 kN and Mx = My = 130 N-m. INTRODUCTION The earliest data on humerus bending moments were published by Weber1 in 1859 and Messerer2 in 1880. Since then, only a small amount of work has been done to quantify the strength characteristics of the humerus, especially compared to the work completed on the femur and tibia. Melvin3 lists a comprehensive study of experimental techniques and comments on the rarity of humerus strength and bending data. In 1985, Melvin cites that the upper extremities were injured in 7-10 percent of all motor vehicle accidents compared to the lower extremities that were injured in 10-13 percent of all accidents. Upper arm fractures are historically rare in typical side impact testing. For example, during thoracic impacts with the arm down, using a rigid lateral impactor, Cesari et. al.4 observed only one upper arm fracture with a dynamic pendulum loading of 416 kg, but many rib fractures. He stated that "the arm seems to distribute loading to [the] chest but does not absorb energy. It could absorb energy only if broken by the impact, but it is more resistant than the thorax and normally, the rib fractures occur at a lower level than the arm fracture." The advent of new side impact technologies, which can interact with the occupant arm in both the A-P and L-M directions, could change these accident statistics. Given the change in ßide impact interactions, the humerus strength in bending and shear needed to be revisited. Weber and Messerer were the first to investigate the fracture of long bones. The humerus was included in both of their studies. Weber1 used static loads and three-point bending testing to obtain a maximum bending moment value for the humerus of 115 N-m for men and 73 N-m for women. Messerer2 used quasi-static balance-beam loading to obtain an average maximum moment for the humerus of 151 N-m for men and 85 N-m for women. Yamada5 subjected wet long bones to lateral bending using a central load applied in the A-P direction. The average fracture load for the humerus was 1 .33 kN. The limited amount of humerus data in bending 1766</page><page sequence="2">and the introduction of new side impact technologies, motivated us to pursue further data and to include A- P as well as L-M loading. The use of normalization and scaling techniques described by Mertz6,7 were used to estimate potential injury values for 50th and 5th percentile sized occupants. This was due to the fact that all cadavers are not the same size and simple averages of cadaver data can be misleading. The 5th percentile occupant values were considered important in addition to the 50th percentile values due to the introduction of the next generation small sized side impact dummy called the SID-lls and NHTSA data that indicates that arm injuries from airbag interactions are predominately to smaller female occupants8. METHODOLOGY Ten unembalmed cadaver arm pairs and four individual unembalmed cadaver arms were tested to fracture in three-point bending on an Instron testing machine in either the L-M or A-P direction. Once the direction of loading was chosen, one arm was tested at a comparatively fast (218 mm/s) and the other arm at a slower (0.635 mm/s) loading rate. The shear forces and the bending moments were calculated at the fracture site, and the bones were also evaluated for cross-sectional geometry near the point of fracture and for mineral content. See Appendix A - Table A.1 for the cadaver anthropomorphic data. The cadavers ranged in age from 44 to 75 years of age. There were 13 male cadavers and 1 female cadaver. The upper arms were disarticulated at the shoulder and elbow and the flesh was left intact on the upper arm except for the three loading areas. At the center location an approximate 25 mm by 25 mm section of tissue was removed and an epoxy block molded around the top half of the bone surface. This block served as the loading interface to prevent localized crushing of the bone during testing. After molding to the shape of the bone surface the block was removed and rounded to make the surface contacting the load cell a curve of approximately 25 mm in diameter. Square epoxy blocks encased the ends of the humerus to facilitate load application. See Figure 1 for the test set-up. Load was applied from below with 12.5 mm diameter rollers contacting the epoxy blocks at each end of the humerus. A stationary load cell recorded the load at the center of the arm. Load and deflection were recorded until fracture. Distances between loading points were measured with a vernier scale so moments could be calculated. Figure 1. Instron Three-Point Bending Set-Up. Two directions of loading were used -- the A-P direction and the L-M direction in which My and Mx moments were generated respectively. Two loading rates were used: 218 mm/s and 0.635 mm/s. The faster velocity was limited by the capacity of the test machine. See Figures 2 and 3 for typical force- deflection histories at the faster and slower loading rates on a typical arm pair. These tests were done using an Instron servo-controlled hydraulic testing machine. Figure 2. Force-Deflection History for Slower Loading Rate (0.635 mm/s). Figure 3. Force-Deflection History for Faster Loading Rate (218 mm/s). Four pairs of arms were tested to evaluate the effect of loading rate in the L-M direction. One side (either left or right) was tested at the slower loading rate and the other side at the faster rate. Both 1767</page><page sequence="3">specimens of one arm pair were tested in the L-M direction at the faster loading rate. Four pairs were tested to evaluate the differences between A-P loading at either the faster or the slower loading rate. In the fifth arm pair, the faster loading rate test data were lost and are not included in this paper. The remaining individual arms were tested with two arms at the slower loading rate in the A-P direction and two at the faster rate in L-M loading. See Appendix A - Table A. 2 for the test matrix. After fracture, each specimen was photographed and the anterior and posterior dimensions were measured with a micrometer. A one centimeter transverse slice was removed from the humerus on each side of the fracture site as close as possible to where a full section could be obtained. Scaled photographs were used to digitize the cross-section and compute its properties. See Figure 4 and 5 for a typical digitized cross-section and for a corresponding picture of the same cross-section. An ashing procedure was conducted on the removed sections and the mineral content calculated9. Figure 4. Digitized Cross-Sectional Area. Figure 5. Photographed Cross-Sectional Area. The following equations were used to calculate the normalized forces and moments using the technique developed by Mertz6,7. The normalized shear forces and bending moments were scaled using the characteristic lengths and masses of the Hybrid III 50th and 5th percentile dummies7. The 50th percentile equations are shown. The same procedure was used for the 5th percentile by substituting the 50th percentile values with the 5th percentile values. L(50) = 36.58 cm L(5) = 30.48 cm M(50) = 1.996 kg M(5) = 1.159 kg First the scale factor along the z-axis of the humerus is calculated.

Tables B.1 and B.2 are the 50th percentile results in the L-M and A-P loading directions. Tables B.3 and B.4 are the 5th percentile results. The normalized results for tests number 1 and 2 in the A-P direction were not calculated due to missing length and mass information. The test results from these tests were still utilized in the correlations between cross-sectional area and rate of mineralization (RM). 1768</page><page sequence="4">Correlation coefficient between the resulting fracture load forces and moments with respect to the cadaver bone cross-sectional areas and RM were calculated. As the resulting correlation coefficient R2 value approaches 1.0, the better the correlation. Statistical significance tests between data sets based on loading rate or direction were conducted using the Student t-Test with a 95 percent confidence interval. The test assumes the data sets are similar and have unequal variabilities. The probability value or p-value needs to be less than 0.05 for the difference between the data sets to be statistically significant. Conversely, the difference between data sets is not considered to be significantly different when the resulting p-value is greater than 0.05. RESULTS Most of the fractures during testing were simple fractures. Sometimes there were small bone fragments present. There were three prominent types of fractures observed. Straight simple fractures, mostly perpendicular to the long axis of the bone were observed in 9 of the specimens. Angled simple fractures were observed in 1 1 of the specimens. In 3 specimens, spiral or irregular fractures occurred. Cracks initiated on the tension side of the bone and propagated at an angle towards the compression side in the direction of the elbow. See Figure 6 for a typical post-test x-ray of an angled fracture site. Figure 6. X-ray of a typical fracture. The loading, cross-sectional and mineral content data were tabulated and are presented in Appendix A - Tables A. 3 to A. 5 respectively. The average overall bending moment was 155 N-m with a sample standard deviation of 44.6 N-m. The average overall shear force was 1.96 kN with a sample standard deviation of 0.67 kN. See Figures 7 and 8 for the generated test forces and moments respectively. See Table A. 3 for the loading data results. Figure 7. Test Forces Figure 8. Test Moments The average specimen cross-sectional area was 240 mm2. The range of the cross-sectional areas was 151 to 353 mm2. The correlation between cross- sectional area and the generated forces or moments is minimal. The R2 values for the forces and moments with respect to cross-sectional area were 0.188 and 0.446 respectively. See Appendix A - Table A. 4 for the cross-sectional properties of each sample. The average RM for the cadavers was 58.8 percent with a sample standard deviation of 3.4 percent. The correlation between the RM and the forces or moments is less than that for the cross- section correlation. The R2 values for the forces and moments with respect to RM are 0.177 and 0.211 respectively. See Appendix A - Table A. 5 for the ash content of each sample. The normalized average 50th percentile shear force in the L-M direction, Fy was 2.68 kN with a sample standard deviation of 0.69 kN. In the A-P direction, Fx was 2.17 kN with a sample standard deviation of 0.28 kN. See Figures 9 and 10 for the normalized 50th percentile L-M and A-P forces respectively. The normalized average 50th lateral percentile bending moment, Mx, was 236 N-m with a standard deviation of 57.7 N-m; and the A-P moment, My, was 226 N-m with a sample standard deviation of 77.3 N-m. See Figures 11 and 12 for the normalized 50th percentile L-M and A-P bending moments respectively. See Appendix B - Tables B.1 and B.2 for individual 50th percentile normalized test results in the L-M and A-P directions respectively. 1769</page><page sequence="5">Figure 9.

As to be expected, the faster rate generated higher moments and forces in both loading 1770</page><page sequence="6">directions. The faster loading rate resulted in 1 1 percent and 3 percent higher fracture forces in the A- P and L-M loading directions. The faster loading rate resulted in 14 percent and 8 percent higher fracture moments in the A-P and L-M loading directions. The differences between the faster and slower loading rates were not significant using a Student t- Test (p-value &gt; 0.05). The one-tailed p-values for the normalized forces were 0.101 and 0.425 in the A-P and L-M directions respectively. The p-values for the normalized moments were 0.341 and 0.257 in the same directions. The difference between the L-M and A-P direction normalized forces and moments was not statistically significant using the Student t-Test (where the p- value &gt; 0.05). The normalized forces had a one- tailed p-value of 0.099 and 0.107 at the slower and faster loading rates. The normalized moments had a one-tailed p-value of 0.384 and 0.499 at the same loading rates. DISCUSSION Variability is always a concern when using cadaveric specimens. The Mertz normalization technique was used to help reduce the variability due to cadaver arm length and mass. The limitations of this method are that other individual cadaver characteristics such as bone condition, age and cross-sectional area and shape are still present, and cannot be incorporated. The specimens before normalization fall within a 673 N with a 45 N-m standard deviation corridor for the forces and moments. This accounts for less than 35 percent of the average forces and moments generated. An exception to this observation is specimen number 877, used in tests numbered 6 and 7, which had an unusually strong response. This specimen did not have the largest cross-sectional area, but did have the highest RM at 62.1 percent compared to an average of 58.8 percent. There was only a small amount of correlation between the RM and the fracture forces and moments results with R2 values of 0.177 and 0.211. Nevertheless, specimen 877 that had the highest fracture forces and moments before normalization also had the highest RM values. The loading rate comparison was broken down into the separate loading directions where A-P faster and slower loading rates were compared separately from the L-M faster and slower loading rates. All of the load rate comparisons were not statistically significantly different. The load rate comparison with the smallest one-tailed p-value was the shear fractures force in the A-P loading direction. The loading direction comparison was separated into slower and faster loading rates comparisons. None of the loading direction comparison differences were statistically significant. The loading direction comparisons with the smallest one-tailed p-value were the shear forces at both slower and the faster loading rates with p-values of 0.099 and 0.107 respectively. No significant difference was found between the L-M and A-P loading directions and the two loading rates. The Student t-Test was specifically used for smaller sample sizes where n &lt; 30. The lack of statistical significance could be due to the small sample size. A weak difference could be present, but the sample size may not have been strong enough to prove the data sets significantly different. The loading duration in these tests are slow compared to dynamic test conditions where loading can occur within 50 ms. Next steps will be to pursue additional testing at higher rates of loading where dynamic loading effects can be included. The duration of loading is one of several reasons why these results are higher than the work previously reported by Weber and Messerer. Other reasons are differences in test set-up, specimen preparation and specimen quality. In addition, the improvements in biomechanical testing procedures since the 1880's may also account for differences between this study and those of Weber and Messerer. CONCLUSIONS The lack of statistically significant differences between loading rates and loading directions allowed us to pool all the sample data sets to derive a PRV from a larger sample. The pooled normalized response data indicates the following humerus proposed PRV: 50th percentile Fx = Fy = 2.5 kN, Mx = My = 230 N-m 5th percentile Fx = Fy = 1.7 kN, Mx = My = 130 N-m ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank Mark Brandon, Roger Daniel, Agnes Kim and Priya Prasad for their editorial and moral support.
