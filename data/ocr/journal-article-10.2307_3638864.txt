<plain_text><page sequence="1">Science, Sentiment, and Anxiety: American Nature Writing at the Turn of the Century Lisa Mighetto The author is a doctoral student in history in the University of Washington. IN TRACING the origins of nature appreciation, historians of the American environment have generally focused on the establish- ment of wilderness, national parks, and similar institutions asso- ciated with the protection of landscapes, devoting little attention to the literature about nature. Such writings, however, aided the cause of preservation and also addressed larger social and intel- lectual issues that went far beyond the need to set aside national lands.' An examination of the genre reveals that the United States at the turn of the century was an anxious nation caught between 'See, for example, Roderick Nash, Wilderness and the American Mind (3rd ed., New Ha- ven, 1982); Alfred Runte, National Parks: The American Experience (Lincoln, 1979); Hans Huth, Nature and the American: Three Centuries of Changing Attitudes (Berkeley, 1957); Sam- uel P. Hays, Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement, 1890-1920 (Cambridge, Mass., 1959). For a description of American nature writing, see PeterJ. Schmitt, Back to Nature: The Arcadian Myth in Urban America (New York, 1969), 45- 55, and Paul Brooks, Speaking for Nature: How Literary Naturalists from Henry Thoreau to Rachel Carson Have Shaped America (Boston, 1980). Neither of these authors, though, fo- cuses on the anxiety concerning evolutionary theories at the turn of the century. An im- portant examination of Darwinism is offered in Donald Worster's Nature's Economy: The Roots of Ecology (San Francisco, 1977), but his study is more concerned with the implica- tions of scientific discoveries regarding natural law rather than the social dislocations they affected outside the scientific community. Although it concerns a later period than that 33 Pacific Historical Review ? 1985, by the Pacific Coast Branch American Historical Association</page><page sequence="2">34 PACIFIC HISTORICAL REVIEW the notion that evolution was a positive force and what seemed to be evidence to the contrary. Those impressed with the contrary evidence included such prominent intellectuals as the sociologist E. A. Ross. "The worth- lessness of life," he noted in 1891, "is an idea that agrees with sci- ence" and "meets the mood of the age." To him, the implications of biological theories - particularly those of Charles Darwin and August Weismann -were bleak, leaving mankind with "[n]othing... mysterious, nothing unique, nothing divine." Hu- man history, it seemed, has been governed solely by the "struggle for existence."2 Throughout the late nineteenth century, articles expressing similar notions appeared in American popular jour- nals with revealing frequency. Summing up the Zeitgeist, Herbert Ernest Cushman, a despairing Outlook contributor, described his as the "century of pessimism."3 Science, many Victorian writers agreed, was responsible for this malaise. Proving the natural world to be amoral, arbitrary, even cruel, it stripped man of his illusions, setting him adrift in a void. The emphasis on strife in Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology (1830), for instance, had prompted Alfred, Lord Tennyson's omi- nous lines: [Man] trusted God was love indeed, And love Creation's final law; Tho' nature, red in tooth and claw With ravin, shrieked against his creed.4 examined in this essay, Susan R. Schrepfer's The Fight to Save the Redwoods: A History of Environmental Reform, 1917-1978 (Madison, 1983), 79- 102, is a pertinent environmental history which discusses the impact of theories of evolution on several preservationist groups. 2E.

Bannister, Social Darwin- ism: Science and Myth in Anglo-American Social Thought (Philadelphia, 1979), and Cynthia Eagle Russett, Darwin in America: The Intellectual Response, 1865-1912 (San Francisco, 1976). Although the reaction to science among Europeans is outside the scope of this essay, re- lated works concerning Victorian England include Gertrude Himmelfarb, Darwin and the Darwinian Revolution (New York, 1959); James Turner, Reckoning with the Beast: Animals, Pain, and Humanity in the Victorian Mind (Baltimore, 1980); and Richard French, Anti-Vivi- section and Medical Science (Princeton, N.J., 1975). The latter two works argue that the emergence of animal protection societies in late nineteenth-century England relate in part to the reaction against scientific materialism. 3Herbert Ernest Cushman, "Professor August Weismann," Outlook, LV (Jan. 16, 1897), 253. 4Alfred, Lord Tennyson, "In Memoriam," in M.

More- over, Darwin's theories, linking humans and animals, led to frightening speculation concerning man's bestial nature. Ameri- can writers like Stephen Crane, Frank Norris, and Theodore Dreiser portrayed the animality of their characters in an unflat- tering light. In his Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Robert Louis Stevenson, too, explored the primal brutality lurking within a seemingly civilized man.5 These fears, though, were countered continually in the United States by a variety of popular writers who looked to nature for reassurance that man was not the victim of indifferent, uncon- trollable forces. Releasing their readers from the grim universe that science had exposed, many turn-of-the-century nature writ- ers provided, through firsthand observation, evidence of dignity, beneficence, and morality in the natural world. The prevalence of their genre -nearly every issue of most popular magazines contained at least one nature essay or story -coupled with the book sales of such authors as John Muir and Ernest Thompson Seton, demonstrates that Americans of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were indeed interested in reading about this aspect of nature. Contemporary critics recognized that the appeal of nature writing had increased greatly at the turn of the century. They noted also that the genre differed from previous nature writing: this "present-day interest," explained an Atlantic Monthly reviewer, is predicated on facts and accuracy of detail. Seton, for instance, actually "lived with the creatures of nature," portraying them "as they really are."6 His extensive wilderness excursions included a six-month trip to the Arctic. Muir--the most celebrated nature writer in the West - spent numerous seasons in the wild. These two, along with a myriad of authors who have since sunk into ob- scurity, enjoyed close contact with the natural world and pro- duced widely read accounts of their experiences.7 5Robert Louis Stevenson, Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886; New York, 1950). 6George S.

Nonetheless, in conveying their observations of animals, late nineteenth-century nature writers rarely emphasized ferocity; instead, they focused on traits which resembled those of admirable humans. Though this tendency can be traced to the time-honored tradition of Aesop, what distinguishes these authors from their predecessors was the insistence that their animal portrayals were true to life. "[My] ani- mals," Seton asserted, "were all real characters. They lived the lives I have depicted, and showed the stamp of heroism and per- sonality more strongly by far than it has been in the power of my pen to tell."8 Being difficult to substantiate, such claims were bound to get Seton and his fellow animal biographers into trou- ble.9 Another quality separating turn-of-the-century authors from the long tradition of nature writers who preceded them was their sympathy for the natural world, which often culminated in pleas for its preservation. Certainly the animals portrayed by the turn-of-the-century writers, like those depicted by Aesop, served to inspire and in- struct. These later creatures, though, also disputed the dismal conclusions of science. Esteem for man, it seemed, could be re- stored through his association with "virtuous" animals - a possi- bility which nineteenth-century critics greeted with interest. One reviewer of nature books perceived that "when, not so very long ago, man waked up to the fact that he was mere mammal, he be- gan to cast about to see what could be said for his nearest rela- tions." Because "we are only a little higher than the dog," he con- which, according to Frank Luther Mott, had circulations amounting to as much as 200,000.

'The "nature faker" controversy has been described in Schmitt's Back to Nature, 45- 55, and Paul Brooks's Speaking for Nature, 201- 218. Again, neither of these authors consider the relationship between "nature faking" and attitudes toward science. See also John Henry Wadland's Ernest Thompson Seton: Man and Nature in the Progressive Era, 1880-1915 (New York, 1978). Favorably portraying Seton, this author defends the naturalist against charges of nature faking; he does not, however, discuss popular reactions to science. Robert H. McDonald, "The Revolt Against Instinct: The Animal Stories of Seton and Roberts," Canadian Literature, LXXXIV (Spring 1980), 18-29, does relate science to na- ture writing. Nevertheless, as its title suggests, his article addresses only the instinct versus intelligence issue and is limited, for the most part, to two Canadian writers. His conclusion emphasizes the emergence of the Boy Scouts of America, an organization in which Seton had a hand.</page><page sequence="5">Science, Sentiment, and Anxiety 37 tinued, "we may as well make the dog out to be as fine a fellow as possible."'0 Numerous nature writers -especially those who adopted the narrative format - did exactly that. In fact, animal stories of the period usually featured refined, noble creatures -a depiction which must have appeared credi- ble, given the fact that current studies had affirmed that animals possessed aesthetic sensibilities." Seton, a Canadian who became the United States' most prominent animal story writer, was al- ways careful to point out the honorableness of his characters. A tale in his popular Wild Animals I Have Known, for example, pre- sented a vixen feeding her cub poisoned meat to save him from the debasement of being chained. Furthermore, Seton implied that she later committed suicide to escape her "sorrowful life." His famous "pacing mustang" similarly chose death over suffer- ing in captivity.'2 Though these points were later discounted by a variety of critics, Seton continually swore that all his stories were rooted in fact. A gifted artist as well as a writer, he was to earn a reputation as a competent field naturalist. Seton was not the only author concerned with the nobility of animals. The subject of animal suicide was also taken up by Mabel Osgood Wright, who told of wolves taking their own lives after losing their mates.'3 Charles Roberts, another Canadian whose works were read widely in the United States, suggested that even a bee is capable of a "sturdy spirit" which forbids "ignominy." His gander received further elevation, being described as "a gentle- man in feathers."'4 Like those of Seton, Roberts's animals were not degraded brutes, but highly sensitive beings. Related to this attempt to impart dignity to animals was the insistence upon their individuality. The increasing tendency of scientists to consider animals--and, more disconcertingly, humans - merely in terms of species drew criticism from their ranks as well as from lay observers. In Science magazine, for in- stance, an anatomist asserted that "there is as distinct and charac- '0H.W.

Olive Thorne Miller, author of voluminous bird books, also remarked on the uniqueness of her subjects. The "un- dying charm of bird study," she explained, "lies in the individual- ity of these lovely fellow creatures, and the study of each one is the study of a unique personality, with characteristics, habits, and a song belonging exclusively to itself. Not even in externals are birds counterparts of one another." Thus, she concluded in an- other article, "it is not safe tojudge [a] species 'en masse.'"'16 Other nature writers supported Miller's notion. An entire chapter in Florence A. Merriam's A-Birding on a Bronco was de- voted to uniqueness.'7 In addition, the subject of animal individu- ality was considered by William J. Long, a Congregationalist min- ister and writer of animal stories up through the 1930s, who observed with characteristic blatancy: "there is no such entity as a species, which is merely a group of individuals."'" Even respected naturalists like John Muir and Enos Mills argued that each ani- mal is essentially different from his fellows. Significantly, this propensity was received with approval: when Effie Bignell, an- other bird lover, produced the tellingly titled Mr. Chupes and Miss Jenny: The Life Story of Two Robins, the Nation welcomed the book as "one of the most fascinating bits of popular natural history" encountered "in many a day."'9 Observations concerning individuality allowed animal biogra- phers to portray wonderous, exceptional creatures who sometimes strained the limits of credibility. Seton's "Redruff," for example, was "the biggest, strongest, and handsomest" of partridges. His ram was even more spectacular: "Krag must have been the idol of his band. For matched with rams he had seemed a wonder, and among ewes, his strength, his size, and the curling horns must have made of him a demigod, and the winged heart and the brimming cup were his." In fact, the title of his book, Animal Heroes, indicates 15W. C. Barrett, "Character in Animals," Science, XXI (June 9, 1893), 312.

In one sense, the em- phasis of these authors upon the superior animal corroborates Darwinian theories concerning the survival of the fittest; Seton especially pointed out that the weak often perish. More likely, though, their portrayals served a counterpurpose: the possibility of stupendousness among the animals helped lift them - as well as their human analogues - above the status of mere brutes. With the same end in mind, writers about animals also focused upon intelligence. Throughout his stories, Seton stressed the wit of his creatures.2' However, their wisdom was not innate; most of them had been "taught" survival skills, either by their mothers or by leaders like Silverspot, who "organized" and "drilled" his fellow crows.22 That Long harkened to a similar theme is evidenced by the title of his book, School of the Woods.23 Numerous essayists sup- ported the notion of animal education. Effie Bignell, for one, claimed to have witnessed a "little squirrel lady" training her off- spring.24 Likewise, Ernest Ingersoll- whose veracity in animal re- porting would later be commended by President Theodore Roosevelt -described "morning lessons" in nut hunting.25 A re- spected bird watcher, Olive Thorne Miller, also depicted a variety of teaching endeavors, including a music lesson. She suggested - albeit half in jest -that even some flowers are intelligent.26 The most celebrated writer to discuss animals teaching their young was Gene Stratton-Porter. Considering herself to be primarily a natu- ralist, she produced numerous popular novels in which nature was employed as a significant backdrop. In addition, Porter wrote such articles as "The Birds' Kindergarten," indicating her interest in animal intelligence.27 20Seton, Wild Animals, 264; Lives of the Hunted (New York, 1901), 63; Animal Heroes (New York, 1905). 21 McDonald, "The Revolt Against Instinct," 18- 29. 22Seton, Wild Animals, 49. 2"WilliamJ.

Americans at the turn of the century did not want to believe that behavior is dictated solely by instinct; nature writers assured them that intelligence accounts for the survival of most animals. Furthermore, during the 1890s, a bitter debate erupted between followers of August Weismann, the German biologist who asserted the importance of heredity, and neo-Lamarckians, who emphasized environmental- ism. Because Weismannism appeared deterministic, many Ameri- cans embraced the latter view.28 In any event, Long noted that these two issues were linked. "Most people think that the life of a wild animal is governed wholly by instinct," his preface to School of the Woods reads. "They are of the same class who hold that the char- acter of a child is largely predetermined by heredity."29 Much of Long's work was in fact devoted to refuting such contentions. Though the ideas of high-brow scientists did not radiate down to the popular level in pure form, writers like Long represent a coun- terforce to intellectual currents generated by nineteenth-century science. In sum, Americans found the premise that the develop- ment of an animal or plant could be affected by externalities com- forting; it provided the feeling that they were in control and could improve their lot. It is significant, then, that Long presented intel- ligence not as an inborn, but an acquired quality. Long's emphasis upon animal reason went far beyond that of his contemporaries. His article entitled "Animal Surgery," pub- lished in 1903, recounted observations of animal behavior which were unusual to say the least. He told of a muskrat, for instance, who, after amputating his trapped leg, smeared the wound with gum. Bears, Long explained, also use clay to heal themselves. Even more striking was his account of the woodcock who was dis- covered plastering a mixture of mud and grass upon his broken leg. After allowing the clay bandage to harden, the bird flew away, good as new.30 Needless to say, this assertion - presented in all seriousness -outraged scientists, provoking a storm of pro- 2"Bannister, Social Darwinism, 138- 139. 29Long, School of the Woods, 5. 3"WilliamJ.

William Morton Wheeler, a Harvard biologist, was among the leaders of the attack. Particularly disturbed by Long's woodcock story, he denied, in Science magazine, that a bird could have a pri- ori knowledge of the properties of clay, let alone bone setting techniques. "Could the creature have been captured," he sneered, "we venture to affirm that he would have been eligible to a chair in surgery in one of our leading medical schools, and a phenomenally rapid progress of the science would have been in- sured." Long's article, in Wheeler's estimation, was not only de- void of scientific merit, but was "bad even as fiction.""31 Not one to take criticism lightly, Long immediately shot back, citing numer- ous witnesses to animal doctoring similar to those reported in his article. One of these claimed to have presented another wood- cock with a self-bandaged leg to a physician, who "upon examin- ing it expressed him in a most emphatic way by saying that it was a better job than nine tenths of the surgeons could do."32 The de- bate raged on until the exasperated editors refused to print any- thing further on the subject. Meanwhile, John Burroughs, the nation's most eminent nature writer, entered the controversy. Distinguishing between "real" and "sham" natural history, he denounced Seton, Roberts, and Long for misleading their readers.3 Animals, he argued, are creatures of instinct. During the dispute, Burroughs noted in an attempt to disallow the notion of animal reason, that intelligence is indicated by language. Later, Long produced a book entitled How Animals Talk."4 So vehemently did Burroughs contest the idea of intelligence that he disturbed his friend John Muir, who had noticed evidence of reason among animals.35 Moreover, Bur- 31William Morton Wheeler, "Woodcock Surgery," Science XIX (Feb. 16, 1904), 350. 32S.

Other nature writers took the opportunity to vindicate their genre. Dallas Lore Sharp, for instance, was quick to dissociate himself from Long's brand of nature writing. Poking fun at Long, Sharp lamented that the author had seen "quite so much with his own eyes, for many of us live the year round in the woods, and - well - most of our animals must have gone over into Mr. Long's woods."36 Flagrantly outstepping the bounds of fact, Long thus incurred the scorn not only of scientists, but also of his fellow nature writers. The most prominent figure to become involved in the debate was Theodore Roosevelt. A naturalist in his own right, the Presi- dent, echoing Burroughs, derided Long as being "the yellow journalist of the woods" who wrote only about "story book beasts." As a hunter, he was especially incensed by Long's account of a wolf that bit through the chest of a caribou, reaching the ani- mal's heart and killing him instantly. Long's woodcock article was another source of irritation to the President: "[I]t seems a pity," he observed, "not to have added that [the bird] also made itself a crutch to use while the splint was on." Referring to those who ro- manticized wildlife as "nature fakers," Roosevelt asserted the im- portance of accuracy in natural history.37 While Roosevelt and his fellow critics focused upon the trans- gressions of Seton and Long, they neglected to point out the sen- timentality of other nature writers. Miller, for example, was fre- quently-albeit gently--chided for what one reviewer called "[putting] the facts ... to a slight tension"; yet she escaped the epithet "nature faker."38 Similarly, Porter avoided Roosevelt's wrath, despite the fact that her portrayals of wildlife were frankly moralistic. Certainly she received heavy reproof from critics of literature, who dismissed her work as "molasses fiction."

The President's participation in the nature faker controversy attests to its magnitude. "From an insignificant smudge," one ob- server wrote, "[the issue] has become a roaring blaze and its sparks are kindling throughout the land.""3 Sympathetic readers were quick to defend the animal biographers: "Children and mere lovers of nature," offered one woman, "owe no small debt to men like WilliamJ. Long." In the writer's defense, she poignantly noted that his anecdotes were no more incredible than those of Darwin.40 Similarly, reviewers defended Seton's work throughout his career. According to a Dial critic, it was the "human element" which Seton imparted to his "animal friends" that was responsi- ble for his "well-deserved popularity."41 William T. Hornaday, di- rector of the New York Zoological Park, also praised him: in a review of Wild Animals I Have Known -a book which Burroughs claimed should have been entitled Wild Animals I Alone Have Known - he pronounced Seton's work "altogether fine." Horna- day in fact was becoming weary of "the same old annual parade of toothless and decrepit stories of fierce wild cats, aggressive pu- mas, dueling bears and alligators, and child-stealing eagles."42 In other words, like many Americans, he wanted to read stories that muted the struggle for existence. Popular nature writers thus stressed what Burroughs called "universal beneficence."" Animals, they argued, are not engaged in grim competition; cooperation is the first rule of the natural world. Turn-of-the-century nature essays are filled with exam- ples of altruistic birds rescuing fellows with broken wings and rodents bringing food to aged or blind relatives. This kindness was not limited to members of the same species: in the Atlantic Monthly, E. P. Evans described a rat who brought daily offerings of corn kernels to a lame dove.44 Long, who denied that even preda- "3Frank Chapman, "The Case of William J.

In a statement which exemplifies his penchant for hyper- bole, he likened "wild beasts" to "the cherubim."45 Similarly, though Seton and Roberts conceded a degree of death and terror in the wild, many of their stories centered around maternal ten- derness which was frequently extended to the young of different species. "Wild adoption" became a prevalent theme in the works of both authors. Though the extent to which these nature writers were influenced by the ideas of Prince Kropotkin is difficult to determine, their benign animals are similar to those presented in the Russian thinker's Mutual Aid (1902). Emphasizing coopera- tion, Kropotkin's book was intended to counter the bleak asser- tions of Thomas Henry Huxley - "Darwin's bulldog" - concern- ing competition and conflict in the natural world.46 "We gaze morbidly ... upon our beautiful world," John Muir lamented, "and see ferocious beasts and wastes and deserts."'4 To prove their point, popular naturalists often looked to the creatures who had reputations for bloodthirstiness. Their special fondness for wolves led Seton and Long to produce story after story depicting the compassion of these animals. In his essays, Muir vindicated rattlesnakes as well as bears, noting their timid- ity and gentleness.48 Even seemingly aggressive insects received consideration: among spiders, according to Miller, "there are in- stances of gregarious living, as well as of small spiders being not unwelcome guests in the web of larger ones."49 If, on the other hand, it appeared impossible to mitigate the ferocity of carni- vores, some naturalists simply omitted them from their studies. Neltje Blanchan's Bird Neighbors, for example, contained no men- tion of birds of prey.50 When they were discussed, predators were dismissed as aberrant villains, as in the case of Mabel Osgood Wright's Birdcraft, which suggested that one species of hawk "is a 45Long, MotherNature, 85. 46Peter Kropotkin, Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution, edited by Paul Avrich (1902; New York, 1972), 7- 10. 47Linnie Marsh Wolfe, ed., John of the Mountains: The Unpublished Journals of John Muir (Cambridge, Mass., 1938), 82. 48John Muir, Our National Parks (New York, 1901), 57. 49Olive Thorne Miller, "The Spinning Sisterhood," Popular Science Monthly, XXXIX (Oct. 1891), 829- 830. 5'Neltje Blanchan, Bird Neighbors (New York, 1902).</page><page sequence="13">Science, Sentiment, and Anxiety 45 worthy target for rifle practice." That Wright believed in the benignity of most creatures is evidenced in her book, The Friend- ship ofNature.51 In their negation of strife, a few nature writers went so far as to deny that animals suffer pain. "I never saw one drop of blood, one red stain on all this wilderness," asserted Muir. He imagined, for instance, that an ouzel would die without "gloom," vanishing "like a flower, or a foam-bell at the foot of a waterfall."52 Long provided the most poignant example of this tendency: "the animals which perish under the teeth and claws of other beasts meet a merciful end," he assured his readers. "[V]ictims perish instantly for the most part."5 Viewed in this light, Long's account of the wolf that so quickly killed the caribou assumes a significance unnoticed by the critical Roosevelt. Burroughs himself stressed the absence of pain in the natural world, claiming that "tooth and claw usually overwhelm by a sudden blow, and sudden blows benumb and par- alyze." For all his criticism, Burroughs was in sympathy with the motives of the nature fakers, if not with their tactics. Much of his writing --especially toward the end of his life - refuted the no- tion that nature is cruel. "As a whole, the universe is all good," he observed in his last book.54 These writers, then, attempted to assuage the pessimism of their age by demonstrating that it had no basis in the natural world. To Muir, the wilderness was full of "happy birds and beasts."55 Accordingly, Long proposed to write "animal come- dies" to discount the charge that life in the woods is tragic. Evans supported this position, claiming that wild creatures possess a "sense of humor" and can even "appreciate a practical joke."56 They sought also to dispel the fear that nature is chaotic and haphazard, for the Origin of Species had undermined pre-Dar- winian assumptions concerning the harmonious, self-regulating 51 Mabel Osgood Wright, Birdcraft: A Field Book of Two Hundred Song, Game and Water Birds (New York, 1897), 216; The Friendship of Nature (New York, 1898). 52Wolfe, John of the Mountains, 93 and 165; see also Muir, My First Summer in the Sierra (Boston, 1911), 141. 53Long, MotherNature, 308. 5"John Burroughs, "Is Nature Cruel?"

Moreover, in his Romanes lecture (1893), T. H. Huxley unveiled a godless universe where ethics counted for nothing: "the wicked," he observed, "flourishes like a green bay tree, while the righteous begs his bread." Concluding his address, the hard-bitten Darwinist claimed that "the ethical progress of society depends, not on imitating the cosmic process, still less in running away from it, but in combating it."58 Turn-of-the-century nature writers, on the other hand, set about to find morality in the wild. Seton especially was concerned with this task. "Conventionality and social rules," he claimed in 1901, are not "silly man-made tyrannies. They are really impor- tant laws that, like gravitation, were here before human society began, and shaped it when it came.""59 His stories illustrated that "bad" animals who fail to acknowledge these rules are punished. Other nature writers supported the notion that animals have moral perception: "bird courts," wherein guilty creatures are ar- raigned and executed by their fellows, were a popular subject. Evans, for instance, reported an experiment in which a goose's egg was placed in the nest of a stork. When the "questionable progeny" hatched, the stork husband, who had been "thrown into the greatest excitement," returned to the nest with nearly five hundred storks. These birds, Evans claimed, held a "mass meet- ing," where they were "addressed by several speakers, each orator posting himself on the same spot before beginning his ha- rangue." Concluding their deliberations, the storks pounced on the "unfaithful" female and her hapless gosling, killing them both. In addition to valuing "conjugal fidelity," animals, Evans pointed out, possess a "lively sense of what is lawful."60 Returning to this theme in "The Natural History of the Ten Commandments," Seton demonstrated that traditional virtues have a place in the process of natural selection. Using the rhetoric of Darwinism, he explained that the most "successful" animals are obedient, honest, and monogamous. Furthermore, the higher ani- 57Bannister, Social Darwinism, 9.

This idea was explored more extensively in a fable published in Century magazine, which described a pair of Phoebes whose trust in an "invisible power" saved them from a variety of "devils."61 Simi- larly, Muir was convinced that animals have souls.62 Evidence of animal spirituality allowed nature writers to argue that the natural world, far from being pointless and amoral, con- tains purpose. It is no accident that many popular naturalists, including Sharp and Long, were clergymen. As such, they op- posed the erosion of spirituality provoked by late nineteenth- century science. Still, neither Sharp nor Long rejected the notion of evolution; they were concerned instead with establishing as fact that order existed. Even Burroughs, less moralistic than his contemporaries, maintained that nature was not arbitrary: "I am persuaded that there is [a Cosmic Mind or Intelligence] in the universe, pervading every atom and molecule in it," he wrote in the Atlantic Monthly.63 Muir, too, heard "a heart beating in every crystal, in every grain of sand," and saw "a wise plan in the making and shaping and placing of every one of them." Despite his repu- diation of orthodox Christianity, Muir wrote in his journal that "[e]very particle of rock or water or air has God by its side leading ... the way it should go."64 The acknowledgment of order in the wild, coupled with the previously discussed assertions of animal intelligence, led to spec- ulation concerning man's responsibilities. In other words, if we are not simply the victims of chaotic external forces or uncontrol- lable inner impulses, we are then accountable for our actions. And nature writers broadened the realm of ethics to include the natural world; nearly all of their works contained pleas for the preservation of wilderness and animals. Popular natural history writing thus became a means to enlist reader sympathy. In one sense, the anthropomorphism that riled critics, earning authors like Long the label "nature faker," served 6Ernest Thompson Seton, "Fable and Woodmyth," Century, LXVII (Nov. 1903), 35. 62Wolfe,John of the Mountains, 277-278. 65John Burroughs, "A Critical Glance into Darwin," Atlantic Monthly, CXXVI (Aug. 1920), 241.

How- ever, nature writers reversed the macabre Jekyll and Hyde theme: rather than portraying man as beast, they tried to demon- strate that beasts were like men. Many of the drawings accompa- nying Seton's stories emphasized the human-like qualities of ani- mals, a propensity which often annoyed reviewers. "Man has nothing that the animals have not at least a vestige of," Seton ex- plained.65 Likewise, the titles of Miller's books, The Bird Our Brother and Little Brothers of the Air, indicate her attempt to link animals and men.66 In Citizen Bird, Wright also suggested that wild creatures are no different from human residents of the country; similarly, her Four-Footed Americans and Their Kin fea- tured "horse and' cow people."67 Muir, too, demonstrated the relationship between man and his "horizontal brothers." He believed that "[a]ny glimpse into the life of an animal quickens our own and makes it so much the larger and better every way." One of his most popular tales in- volved the dog Stickeen, who accompanied him on a harrowing excursion across an Alaskan glacier. As night was falling, the two encountered an enormous crevasse, passable only by means of a precarious ice-sliver bridge. When the terrified dog reached the opposite side of the chasm, he "ran and cried and barked and rolled about fairly hysterical in the sudden revulsion from the depths of despair to triumphant joy." This shared ordeal, contin- ually recounted for admirers, taught Muir that animals are "friends and fellow-mortals indeed"; like Wright, he argued that they are "fellow citizens."68 Animals, these authors agreed, should be treated accordingly. Seton in particular was concerned with wildlife preservation. "Since ... animals are creatures with wants and feelings differing in degree only from our own, they surely have rights," his preface to Wild Animals I Have Known reads.

As its title suggests, Lives of the Hunted undertook to familiarize readers with the creatures which man destroyed for sport or profit.69 Gene Stratton-Porter had a com- parable objective. In The Song of the Cardinal, her story of bird courtship, the animals are indistinguishable from the human characters -a tactic readers greeted with approval. "If the Audubon Society should circulate thousands of copies of this work," one review ventured, "it would do far more to revolution- ize public sentiment than the exposure of the same amount of money in dry arguments or heated protests.'"0 Nature writing helped rouse public support for preservationist proposals at the turn of the century. Muir's essays were especially effective in this respect: appearing in Century, his descriptions of Yosemite advanced the establishment of the region as a national park in 1891. Muir was, according to Roderick Nash, the great "publicizer" of the preservationist movement." Like other nature writers, Muir relied upon appeals to emo- tion. Because lay readers did not want to be bothered with -or further threatened by - the considerations of science, popular naturalists avoided purely factual accounts. As Long pointed out, the public was not concerned with "the fur and feathers that clothed the Wood Folk," but with "the spirit that animated them."" One of Porter's characters espoused a similar view, advis- ing readers not "to bother none 'bout the discoveries of science.""73 Disconcerted by this tendency in nature writing, Burroughs at- tempted an explanation. "Science is impersonal and cold," he wrote, "and is not for the heart but for the head. The heart sym- bolizes so much for us, it stands for the very color ... of life, for the whole world of sentiment and emotion - a world that lies out- side the sphere of science."" At the turn of the century, these two spheres appeared irreconcilable. 69Seton, Wild Animals, 12; Seton, Lives of the Hunted, 12. 70B. O.

The controversy involving the attempt to dam the Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite (1907-1913) provides a notable example. Such journals as Outlook, Nation, Century, and Independent, which regularly offered nature essays and stories, protested the reser- voir, spurring a remarkable public outcy in favor of natural scen- ery. In fact, the establishment of the National Park Service in 1916 can be traced to the furor generated by this controversy.75 Certainly nature writing increased the enthusiasm for nature, which, in the early twentieth century, rose to a degree that re- mained unmatched until recent years. 75Nash, Wilderness and the American Mind, 176 and 180.</page></plain_text>
