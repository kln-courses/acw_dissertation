Nowadays, the term 'applied logic' has a very wide meaning, as numerous applications of logical l methods in computer science, formal linguistics and other fields testify. Such applications are by no means restricted New to the use of known logical techniques: at its best, applied lication logic involves a back-and-forth dialogue between logical Pubi theory and the problem domain. The papers focus on the application of logic to the study of natural language, in syntax, semantics and pragmatics, and the effect of these studies on the development of logic. In the last decade, the dynamic nature of natural language has been the most interesting challenge for logi cians. Dynamic semantics is here applied to new topics, the dynamic approach is extended to syntax, and several methodological issues in dynamic semantics are system atically investigated. Other methodological issues in the formal studies of natural language are discussed, such as the need for types, modal operators and other logical operators in the formal framework. Further articles address the scope of these methodological issues from other perspectives ranging from cognition to computation. The volume presents papers that are interesting for graduate students and researchers in the field of logic, philosophy of language, formal semantics and pragmatics, and computational linguistics.

Surpris ingly, little of this scholarship has thus far made its way into the field of education, where Dewey's philosophy has traditionally had a wide influence. Many of the New authors of this collection are philosophers who have Publication created some of the most original and influential work in this new scholarship. Four of them - Larry Hickman, Thomas M. Alexander, Raymond D. Boisnet, and J.E. Tiles Dewey - have written major books that have re ceived wide international acclaim. Among the philosophers of education some, like Phil Jackson, are among the best known names in the entire international field, and have kept pace with Deweyan scholarship for many years. Others are younger scholars who know the new scholarship well. Finally, two promi nent feminists contribute important new work on Dewey, expanding the domain of the new scholarship on Dewey. One of them, Susan Laird, has had her work cited in the new biography of John Dewey by Robert Westbrook. Contents and Contributors Introduction: Education and the New Scholarship on John Dewey; J.

'I ll The boundary shift between the 'natural' and the 'social' is becoming permanent: moves in either direction are subject to ideological rhetoric. Yet there is continual exchange New across the line: metaphors are moving freely between biol ogy and the social sciences. As messengers of meaning Publication they become agents of change, forever undermining any attempt at fixing similarities and differences. Biology as Society, Society as Biology: Metaphors offers a unique look at the function of metaphors in mediating be tween two disciplinary cultures which represent and mold our views about nature and society, and the boundary be tween them.

The focus is on the fun damental categories of philosophical grammar, on the analysis of 'Il IllIllIllIllIlllIII intentionality, of belief and Moore's paradox, on certainty and doubt, on will, memory, sensations and emotions, as well as on the theory of aspects and private language and the relationship with New relativism and psychologism. In the recent literature there are undoubtedly numerous qualified Publication publications dedicated to the themes of philosophical psychology as they emerge from Wittgenstein's Nachlal3 and from his writings on this subject published in the last decade. This book, however, provides the essential points of reference of Wittgenstein's late treatment of psychological concepts in the context of the general features of his early philosophy of science and language and in the framework of the trends of his time. The book is of special interest to scholars and students, philoso phers, linguists, psychologists, sociologists, cognitive scientists, logicians, historians of contemporary philosophy and science.
