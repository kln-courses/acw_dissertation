<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Digital liveness A Historico-Philosophical Perspective Philip Auslander When revising my book Liveness: Performance in a Mediatized Culture for the second edition that appeared in 2008 (the book was originally published in 1999) one of the things I wanted to emphasize was the  historicity of the concept of liveness, the way that the idea of what counts culturally  as live experience changes over time in relation to technological change.1 When I  was invited to consider the specific question of digital liveness for a presentation at  Transmediale 2010 in Berlin, however, I found I was no longer satisfied with one  conclusion I had reached, partly because of my own shifting intellectual commit- ments. My review of the history of liveness from the early days of analog sound  recording up to the advent of the digital initially led me to the conclusion that our  experiencing digital technologies as live is a function of the technologies’ ability to  respond to us in real time. I now wish to interrogate my own position in an effort  to outline a phenomenological perspective on digital liveness, defined very broadly. My premise in Liveness is that liveness is not an ontologically defined condition but  a historically variable effect of mediatization. It was the development of recording  technologies that made it both possible and necessary to perceive existing representa- tions as “live.” Prior to the advent of these technologies (e.g., sound recording and  motion pictures), there was no need for a category of “live” performance, for that  category has meaning only in relation to an opposing possibility. The history of live  performance is thus bound up with the history of recording media, and extends over  no more than the past 100 to 150 years. To declare retroactively that all performance  before the mid-nineteenth century was “live” would be to interpret the phenomenon  from the perspective of our present horizon rather than those of earlier periods.  However, the idea of liveness was not brought into being simply by the arrival of  recording technologies. Brian Winston, a historian of media technologies, suggests  that several factors have to be in place for a new medium to develop. These include  “ideation” (the imagination of a new technology to serve a specific purpose) and  the maturation of the science needed to produce it. However, a new medium will  not be developed until a “supervening social necessity” for it is perceived, and it is  selected for investment.2 Winston’s analysis can be extended from media technologies  © 2012 Philip Auslander PAJ 102 (2012), pp. 3–11.  3 </page> <page sequence="2"> themselves to the discourses surrounding them. New ways of thinking and talking  about a new medium will not arise until there is a social need for them.  In the case of sound recording, which developed from the mid-nineteenth century  on, this need did not arise until the institutionalization of radio broadcasting, which  began around 1920. It did not happen earlier because the prior uses to which the  technology was put did not call for it. With cylindrical recordings and phonograph  records, the distinction between live performances and recordings remained experi- entially unproblematic. If you put a record on your gramophone and listened to it,  you knew exactly what you were doing and there was no possibility of mistaking the  activity of listening to a record for that of attending a live performance. As Jacques  Attali points out, the earliest forms of sound recording, such as Edison’s cylinder,  were intended to serve as secondary adjuncts to live performance by preserving it.3  The ways early sound recording technology was used respected and reinforced the  primacy of existing modes of performance. Live and recorded performances thus  coexisted clearly as discrete, complementary experiences, necessitating no particular  effort to distinguish them. Radio broadcasting presented a new problem, however. Radio was institutionalized  primarily as a live medium:  In the U.S., the Department of Commerce [the government agency that  first oversaw radio] granted preferential licenses to stations that didn’t use  recorded music, since there was a feeling that playing records was a rather  inferior style of broadcasting—mainly because live music gave far superior  sound reproduction. In 1927 the industry’s new governing body, the Fed- eral Radio Commission, reemphasized that phonograph performances were  “unnecessary.”4  Listeners therefore had good reason to assume that the music and other program- ming they heard on the air were being performed live.  Unlike the gramophone, however, radio does not allow you to see the sources of the  sounds you are hearing. Radio’s characteristic form of sensory deprivation crucially  undermined the clear-cut distinction between live and recorded sound, and listeners  could not be certain the sounds they were hearing were being produced live as they  were supposed to be. Since some stations, especially smaller ones, did sometimes  broadcast recorded music, there needed to be a way of telling the audience what it  was hearing. For example, during his early morning show on Washington D.C.’s  WJSV in 1939, Arthur Godfrey can be heard to say repeatedly that the music he  is playing is recorded.5 It comes as no surprise in this context that the Oxford English Dictionary’s earliest  example of the use of the word “live” in reference to performance comes from the  BBC Yearbook for 1934 and iterates the consumer complaint “that recorded material  was too liberally used” on the radio. It appears, then, that the concept of the live was  4  PAJ 102 </page> <page sequence="3"> brought into being not just when it became possible to think in those terms—that  is, when recording technologies such as the gramophone were in place to serve as  a ground against which the figure of the live could be perceived—but only when  there was a social necessity to do so.  The need to distinguish live from recorded performances discursively arose as an ethi- cal (and quasi-legal) obligation of radio broadcasters, since their medium muddied  the clear opposition of the live and the recorded in a way previous technologies of  sound reproduction had not. This resulted in the development of a terminological  distinction that attempted to preserve the formerly clear dichotomy between two  modes of performance, the live and the recorded, a dichotomy that had been so  self-evident up to that point that it did not even need to be named. The word “live”  was pressed into service as part of a vocabulary designed to preserve this distinction  discursively even if it could no longer be sustained experientially by the listener’s  relationship to the technology. Because of the negative value attached to the use  of recorded music in early broadcasting, the distinction between the live and the  recorded was conceived as one of binary opposition rather than complementarity.  Although this way of conceptualizing the live and the distinction between the live  and recorded or mediatized originated in the era of analog technologies, it persists  to the present day and is the basis of our current assumptions about liveness.  It is clear from this history that the word live is not used to define intrinsic, onto- logical properties of performance that set it apart from mediatized forms, but is  actually a historically contingent term. The default definition of live performance  is that it is the kind of performance in which the performers and the audience are  both physically and temporally co-present to one another. But over time, we have  come to use the word “live” to describe performance situations that do not meet  these basic conditions. With the advent of broadcast technologies—first radio,  then television—we began to speak of live broadcasts. This phrase is not considered  an oxymoron, even though live broadcasts meet only one of the basic conditions:  performers and audience are temporally co-present, in that the audience witnesses  the performance as it happens, but they are not spatially co-present.  Another use of the term worth considering is in the phrase recorded live. This expres- sion comes even closer to being an oxymoron (how can something be both recorded  and live?) but is another concept we now accept without question. In the case of  live recordings, the audience shares neither a temporal frame nor a physical location  with the performers, but experiences the performance later and in a different place  than it first occurred. The liveness of the experience of listening to or watching the  recording is primarily affective: live recordings allow the listener a sense of participat- ing in a specific performance and a vicarious relationship to the audience for that  performance not accessible through studio productions. The phrases live broadcast and live recording suggest that the definition of what  counts as live has expanded well beyond its initial scope as the concept of liveness  has been articulated to emergent technologies. And the process continues, still in  AUSLANDER / Digital Liveness  5 </page> <page sequence="4"> relation to technological development. Along these lines, Nick Couldry proposes  “two new forms of liveness,” which he calls “online liveness” and “group liveness”:  [O]nline liveness: social co-presence on a variety of scales from very small  groups in chat rooms to huge international audiences for breaking news  on major Web sites, all made possible by the Internet as an underlying  infrastructure. . . . [G]roup liveness[:] . . . the “liveness” of a mobile group  of friends who are in continuous contact via their mobile phones through  calls and texting.6  Understood in this way, the experience of liveness is not limited to specific performer- audience interactions but refers to a sense of always being connected to other people,  of continuous, technologically mediated temporal co-presence with others known  and unknown. Although the decentered experiences of liveness Couldry describes are not easily  assimilable to a performer/audience model, they nevertheless posit liveness as a  technologically mediated relationship among human beings. However, the word  live is now also used to describe connections and interactions between human and  non-human agents. Margaret Morse observes that the imaginary developing around  interactive computer technologies entails an ideology of liveness whose source lies in  our interaction with the machine itself rather than the connections to the outside  world permitted by the machine:  Feedback in the broadest sense . . . is a capacity of a machine to signal or  seem to respond to input instantaneously. A machine that thus “interacts”  with the user even at this minimal level can produce a feeling of “liveness”  and a sense of the machine’s agency and—because it exchanges symbols— even of a subjective encounter with a persona.7 Liveness is also attributed to the entities we access with the machine. When a Web- site is first made available to users, it is said to “go live” (a phrase that originated  in broadcasting). As is true of the computer, the liveness of a Website resides in  the feedback loop we initiate with it: it responds to our input. It may be that we  are now at a point in history at which liveness can no longer be defined in terms  of either the presence of living human beings before each other or physical and  temporal relationships. The emerging definition of liveness may be built primar- ily around the audience’s affective experience. To the extent that Websites and other  virtual entities respond to us in real time, they feel live to us, and this may be the kind  of liveness we now value. This last sentence, which appears in the second edition of Liveness, represents the  position I wish to reconsider here. I still believe that it points in the right direction  by nominating the audience’s experience rather than the properties of the thing  experienced as the locus of liveness. But I now find that my emphasis on feedback  and real-time operations slips into technological determinism by implying that tech- nologies, rather than people, are the causal agents in the experience of digital liveness.  6  PAJ 102 </page> <page sequence="5"> The need for another way of approaching the question is clear simply from the fact  that while real-time operations and the initiation of a feedback loop may be necessary  conditions for the creation of the effect of liveness in our interactions with comput- ers and virtual entities (digital liveness, in short), they are not sufficient conditions.  I do not experience all of the real-time operations my computer performs as live  events. For instance, letters appear on my screen as I type, but I do not apprehend  this phenomenon as a live performance by the computer anymore than I did when  I used a typewriter. When I engage in conversation with a chat-bot, however, I do  experience it as a live interaction. This is not because what the hardware, software,  networks, etc. are doing in the former case is different from they do in the latter  case—it’s all 1s and 0s, after all. Nor does it have to do with the chat-bot’s greater  anthropomorphism. In keeping with phenomenology’s premise that our experience  of the things of the world begins with their disclosing themselves to us, I will suggest  that different digital representations make different claims on us.  I am using the word “claim” in the way that Hans-Georg Gadamer uses it in his  discussion of aesthetics in Truth and Method, a text that will serve as my guide here.  I must emphasize, however, that I am not applying Gadamer’s ideas to the question  of digital liveness. For one thing, I have no interest in arguing that the interactions  I am discussing are necessarily aesthetic in nature (though some are). Rather, I aim  to construct an argument concerning our engaging with machines and virtual enti- ties as live that is analogous to Gadamer’s argument that we engage with works of  art as contemporaneous. Gadamer argues that the way a work of art presents itself to its audience constitutes  a claim, “concretized in a demand” that is fulfilled only when the audience accepts  it.8 Broadly speaking, I am suggesting that some real-time operations of digital  technology make a claim upon us to engage with them as live events and others  do not (I repeat that this does not mean that the former are necessarily aesthetic in  nature). It is crucially important to note that it is up to the audience whether or  not to respect the claim and respond to it.  In the case of interactive technologies, the claim to liveness can be concretized in a  variety of demands. Clifford Nass, a communications scholar at Stanford University,  spearheads a group of researchers who advocate what they call the “Computer as  Social Actor Paradigm.” Their basic claim is that we interact with our computers in  ways that parallel social interactions with other human beings. Nass and Youngme  Moon point to three cues that may “encourage social responses” to the computer:  “1) words for output; 2) interactivity, that is responses based on multiple prior  inputs; 3) the filling of roles traditionally filled by humans.”9 Nass and his colleagues  do not argue that computers are social actors; rather, they argue that we behave  toward them as if they were. In the terms I am using here, these three cues can be  construed as demands (e.g., the demand to be perceived as verbal, the demand to  be perceived as filling a human role) that concretize a claim to liveness. The work  of this group also suggests a straightforward reason why we might respond to such  a demand: in order to engage in an activity we can interpret as a social interaction  or performance, kinds of activity to which we attach great value.  AUSLANDER / Digital Liveness  7 </page> <page sequence="6"> Gadamer argues not only that the work of art makes a claim upon us but also that  in order for a work to be meaningful, we must experience it as contemporaneous,  a term borrowed from Kierkegaard that Gadamer construes as meaning “that this  particular thing that presents itself to us achieves full presence, however remote its  origin may be.”10 Contemporaneity in this sense is not a characteristic of the work  itself; it is a description of how we choose to engage with it. The work of art must  be “experienced and taken seriously as present (and not as something in a distant  past).”11 Gadamer is speaking here of “the temporality of the aesthetic,” the way that  works of art from historical contexts very distant from ours may still make claims  upon us.12 I appeal to Gadamer not to frame an argument about digital liveness in  relation to historical time. Rather, I am focusing on the aspect of Gadamer’s schema  that has to do with bridging a gap between self and other by rendering the other  familiar. A work of art from a past of which we have no direct experience becomes  fully present to us when we grasp it as contemporaneous. I suggest that in order to  experience interactive technologies as live, we similarly must be willing to experi- ence and take seriously their claims to liveness and presence: an entity we know to  be technological that makes a claim to being live becomes fully present to us when  we grasp it as live. In both cases, we must respect the claim made by the object for  the effect to take place. The crucial point is that the effect of full presence that Gadamer describes does not  simply happen and is not caused by the artwork or, in my analogy, the technology.  “[C]ontemporaneity is not a mode of givenness in consciousness, but a task for  consciousness and an achievement that is demanded of it.”13 In other words, live- ness does not inhere in a technological artifact or its operations—it results from our  engagement with it and our willingness to bring it into full presence for ourselves.  We do not perceive interactive technologies as live because they respond to us in  real time, as my earlier statement suggested. Rather, we perceive real-time response  in some cases as a demand that concretizes a claim to liveness, a claim that we,  the audience, must accept as binding upon us in order for it to be fulfilled. Just as  artworks from the past do not simply disclose themselves to us as contemporaneous  but become so only as a conscious achievement on our part, interactive technologies  do not disclose themselves to us as live but become so only as a conscious achieve- ment on our part. In Gadamer’s terms, this achievement in the case of an artwork  “consists in holding on to the thing in such a way that it becomes ‘contemporane- ous’. . . .”14 The expression “holding on” is important here for the way it suggests  both conscious activity and precariousness. It is through a willed and fragile act of  consciousness that we construe works of art from the past as contemporaneous or  interactive technologies as live, an act that must be actively sustained to maintain  the engagement on those terms. Gadamer’s idea that our engagement with works of art takes the form of an achieve- ment demanded of consciousness is consistent with his characterization of the audi- ence’s position as necessarily active rather than passive; to be part of an audience means  to participate rather than simply be there.15 His insistence that it is the audience’s  act of consciousness that allows it to experience the work of art as contemporane- 8  PAJ 102 </page> <page sequence="7"> ous, which I have extended by analogy to the act of consciousness that allows the  audience to experience the virtual as live, points the way beyond the technological  determinism into which discussions of these matters, including my own, often fall. Although I am in many ways sympathetic to the Computer as Social Actor Paradigm,  for example, it does not avoid the pitfall of technological determinism. Nass and Moon  suggest that “mindlessness” accounts for our tendency to interact with machines in  the ways we interact with human beings despite our knowing that machines are not  human. In their account, mindlessness is not exactly equivalent to stupidity. Instead,  they define “mindlessness” as “conscious attention to a subset of contextual cues [in  a situation]” that results in “responding mindlessly, prematurely commit[ting] to  overly simplistic scripts drawn in the past.”16 Since they offer no account of why we  act mindlessly, we are thrown back into a technological determinism in which the  computer’s use of words as output, for instance, causes us to act mindlessly toward  it as if it were a human being. Steve Dixon, in his discussion of liveness in the book Digital Performance, similarly  does not steer clear of technological determinism in his suggestion that different  modes of presentation (e.g., live or recorded, theatre or film) trigger different modes  of attention from the audience. Although he makes a gesture toward the possibil- ity that there is a social dimension to these differences, he concludes by favoring  ontological distinctions among media as causing different responses.17 It is fortuitous  that both Nass and Moon’s and Dixon’s respective discussions center on the matter  of audience attention, for Gadamer defines spectatorship in terms of “devoting one’s  full attention to the matter at hand,” which he further describes as “the spectator’s  own positive accomplishment.”18 In his account, how we direct our attention is not  cued or dictated by the characteristics of the object of our spectating. Rather, it is a  response to a claim advanced by the object of our attention and an accomplishment  on our part. It is our side of the interaction through which liveness or presence  emerges when we are engaging with technologies.  To summarize my argument: some technological artifact—a computer, Website,  network, or virtual entity—makes a claim on us, its audience, to be considered as  live, a claim that is concretized as a demand in some aspect of the way it presents  itself to us (by providing real-time response and interaction or an ongoing connec- tion to others, for example). In order for liveness to occur, we, the audience, must  accept the claim as binding upon us, take it seriously, and hold onto the object in  our consciousness of it in such a way that it becomes live for us. In this analysis,  liveness is neither a characteristic of the object nor an effect caused by some aspect  of the object such as its medium, ability to respond in real time, or anthropomorph- ism. Rather, liveness is an interaction produced through our engagement with the  object and our willingness to accept its claim. In a footnote to the passage on spectatorship I cited, which also has to do with  ecstatic experience and losing oneself by giving oneself over to such experience,  Gadamer argues against distinctions between the “kind of rapture in which it is  AUSLANDER / Digital Liveness  9 </page> <page sequence="8"> in man’s power to produce” and “the experience of a superior power which simply  overwhelms us” on the grounds that “these distinctions of control over oneself and  of being overwhelmed are themselves conceived in terms of power and therefore do  not do justice to the interpenetration of being outside oneself and being involved  with something. . . .”19 Seen in this light, an account of digital liveness that rejects  technological determinism in favor of a constructivist argument that technological  entities are live only inasmuch as we see them that way would miss the mark because  it would simply shift the balance of power from the technology to the spectator  (from technological determinism to spectatorial determinism, so to speak). The  benefit of a phenomenological perspective is that it enables us to understand that  digital liveness is neither caused by intrinsic properties of virtual entities nor simply  constructed by their audiences. Rather, digital liveness emerges as a specific relation  between self and other, a particular way of “being involved with something.” The  experience of liveness results from our conscious act of grasping virtual entities as  live in response to the claims they make on us.
