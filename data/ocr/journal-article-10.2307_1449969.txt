<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Jewish Quarterly Review. A SPECIMEN OF A COMMENTARY AND COLLATED TEXT OF THE TARGUM TO THE PROPHETS. NAHUM. COMPARED with the Targum Onkelos to the Pentateuch, the so-called Targum of Jonathan ben Uziel to the Prophets, has been very much neglected by scholars and students. The modern printed editions of this Targum abound in errors, whilst, as far as could be ascertained, no English translation of the Targum to any of the prophetical books has yet appeared. The following is an attempt to supply this deficiency. The short book of Nahum has been selected as a specimen of what is needed for all the prophetical books. The Mas- soretic text (edited by S. Baer) is here placed side by side with the Targum, the translation of each being subjoined. Thus, at sight, the variations between the original and the Aramaic Version can be noted. From this Book of Nahum, examples can be drawn of the especial characteristics of the Targum, as described by Luzzato, Deutsch, Frankel, Dr. N. M. Adler, and A. Berliner. It will also be observed, that in this book, the Targumic renderings frequently resemble those of similar Hebrew phrases in the Penta- teuch, the dialect being identical. In order to arrive at an accurate text, the edition of the Targum in Walton's Polyglot (London, 1656) has been here reprinted and collated with five MSS. and several printed editions. Three MSS. in the British Museum, a MS. from the Bodleian at Oxford, and one from the Montefiore College, Ramsgate, have been carefully examined. The MSS. of Oxford and Ramsgate are the only copies of the Targum to the Prophets contained in these libraries, and I beg to acknowledge gratefully the courteous assistance rendered me by Dr. Neubauer at Oxford, and Drs. Gaster and Hirschfeld at Ramsgate. I have termed these MSS. respectively:- MS.1. Of the 13th century. British Museum. Add. 26879 (v., Margoliouth, Descriptive List, p. 17). 630</page><page sequence="2">Targum to Nahum. MS.2. A.D. 1475. British Museum. Or. 2211, from Yemen, frequently agrees with Lagarde's text (L).

Was formerly the property of S. D. Luzzato, who describes it in Geiger's Zeitschrift, vol. V., 1844, p. 132, and in Y5"'V n'nrs, p. 742. MS.1, MS.2, 0. and CM. are older than the earliest printed text extant, and are younger only than Lagarde's edition. None of these MSS. appear to have been known to Frankel, Deutsch, Levy, Cornill (Stade's Zeitschrift, 1887), or Taylor (" Micah," 1891). The printed texts used are as follows:- L. The Codex Reuchlinianus, said to be of 1105 A.D., edited by Paul de Lagarde. Not altogether reliable. B. Bomberg's Rabbinical Bible. Editio Princeps, Venice, 1517. (Copied in the main by Buxtorf's Rabbinical Bible, Basel, 1619.) Ant. The Royal or Antwerp Polyglot, 1570. (All refe- rences to this edition are taken from Stade's Zeitschrift, 1887, part II., p. 199.) Warsaw. Mikraoth Gedoloth, Warsaw, 1866. I have carefully punctuated the Targum, following in the lines of Levy (Chald. Wort. iiber die Tar.qumim). Walton's punctuation contains several errors. MS.1 and L, are unpointed; the other MSS. and printed texts vary considerably in their punctuation and are unreliable. The only matter upon which I have not laid stress in col- lating the MSS. and printed texts, is the presence of the letter Yod (0) in a large number of words, where it does not affect the sense. The Yod abounds especially in O., CM. and L. Thus sritrrN ~ , -7rn? , sntw, otherwise written HS1~4, s , 'TI, s'b=sw, Mt1ws. There still remains the task of collecting and collating stray quotations from this Targum that are to be met with in writings of the thirteenth and later centuries-a work that is also required for the text of the Jerusalem Talmud.

The lifting-up of the cup of staggering to give Nineveh to drink thereof - concerning which city, Jonah the son of Amittai, [the prophet] of Gath- Hepher had aforetime uttered prophecy, and it repented of its sins: and when it continued to sin again, he departed thence; and Nahum of Beth-Koshi pro- phes ed against it, as it is written in this book:- 2. God is a judge, and an avenger is the Lord. The Lord taketh vengeance, and great is the power in his presence. Here- after, the Lord will take his vengeance upon the haters of his people, and, in mighty wrath, upon his enemies. 3. The Lord keepeth far his anger: and great is the power in his presence.

The Lord is a jealous God and avengethl; the Lord aveng- eth and is full of wrath; the Lord taketh vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies. 3. The Lord is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means clear the guilty: the Lord hath his way in the whirl- The phrase tW'l D3 is the T. to Mn$nn D1D, to Is. li. 17; cp.

The T. evidently here takes pplW' in the sense of "making a noise," and refers the noise not to the "chariots," as in the text, but to the weapons of the warriors. Cp.

And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan thee? Whence shall I seek comforters for thee ? 8.

This rendering is quoted at the beginning of Midrash Rabba to Genesis; it is adopted by Rashi and Kimchi, upon which see Abarbanel's criticisms, showing the incorrectness of the T.- MK, always rendered (e.g., Jer. xlvi. 25; Ezek. xxx. 14) Alexandria. Cf. Aruch, s.v., and Frankel, p. 27.--tl2, T. n2:1. Cf. Midrash Rabba, 1. c., where lDnK is connected with the root lD ", "to rear children." Dns nrD n3nl1 ;inwrl (Rashi to Nahum, i. 1.), hence ln:l1 '$S should be rendered "Alexandria nutrix" (the nurturer of children). Note that Rashi to Jer. xlvi. 25, renders MD Il^K "La signoria di Alisandra." Vulg., "Alexandria populorum," partly imitated by A. V., " populous No." Upon this, cf. Jerome's Comm. in Naum, i. 1.), " Hebraeus qui me in Scripturis erudivit, ita legi posse asseruit. 'Num melior es quam NO AMON?' et ait, Hebraice VNo dici Alexandriam: Amon autem multitudinem, sive populos [reading tiMl] ..... Non quod eo tempore Alexandria vocaretur, quippe que longo post tempore ab Alexandro Magno Macedonio nomen accepit; sed quia sub nomine primo, i.e., NO, sem- per ZEgypti metropolis fuerit, et abundantissime populis."
