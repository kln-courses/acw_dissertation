Marcum, and John E. Ebinger** 1816 South Oak Street, Illinois Natural History Survey, Champaign, Illinois 61820 ABSTRACT The Iroquois Woods Nature Preserve, located just south of Aroma Park, Kankakee County, is in the Kankakee Sand Area of northeastern Illinois. Three relatively distinct topographic zones exist within the preserve (low terrace, shallow depression, high sand terrace). The forest overstory in all three zones, however, is very similar with most of the same species occurring in each zone, but in different densities. These natural communities are probably due to elevation, distance from the river, soil moisture, and erosion due to flooding events. In the low terrace (mesic sand forest), located near the edge of the Iroquois River channel, Quercus rubra, Tilia americana, Ulmus rubra, Aesculus glabra, and Q. macrocarpa dominate, with the oaks in the larger diameter class. In the shallow depression (wet-mesic sand forest) behind the low terrace Quercus bicolor dominated with 50 stems/ha and accounted for almost half of the total basal area. Tilia americana and U. americana were second and third in importance due to the large number of small diameter individuals. East of the depression was a high sand terrace (dry-mesic sand forest) dominated by Q. alba followed by U. americana, Q. velutina, Prunus serotina, and Q. rubra. This preserve contains one of the few examples of high quality mesic sand forests in the state, but oak regeneration is limited, and shade-tolerant species are becoming more abundant. INTRODUCTION Sand deposits are com- mon in the northern half of Illinois, account- ing for nearly 5% of the land surface of the state (Willman and Frye 1970). The most extensive of these deposits in Illinois is the Kankakee Sand Area Section of the Grand Prairie Natural Division located in parts of Iroquois, Kankakee, and Will counties, Illi- nois, and adjacent Newton County, Indiana (Schwegman 1973). These sand deposits occur on glacial outwash plains associated with erosion events of Wisconsin glaciation (King 1981, Willman and Frye 1970). The sand deposit remained after glacial Lake Watseka and Lake Wauponsee were drained about 14,500 yr ago as glacial moraines and ice dams were breached resulting in the Kanka- kee Torrent (Willman 1973). These sands deposits are mostly associated with xeric vegetation communities that were common *Present address: Golder Associates Ltd., Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2P 3T1. **email address: jeebinger@eiu.edu Received April 10, 2009; Accepted December 16, 2009. in pre-settlement times, though hydric and mesic habitats are occasionally encountered. A few studies of the vegetation in the Kankakee sand deposits have been undertak- en. The pre-settlement vegetation of Iroquois County was studied by Hedborn (1984) while McDowell et al. (1983) described the composi- tion and structure of the savanna communities of the Iroquois County Conservation Area. More recently, Johnson and Ebinger (1992, 1995) studied the effects of fire on the vegeta- tion of the sand savannas at Hooper Branch Nature Preserve, Iroquois County, Illinois. Phillippe et al. (2003) examined the wet and wet-mesic floodplain forests of the Momence Wetlands Nature Preserve in central Kankakee County. The present study was undertaken to determine vascular plant species composition and structure and the floristic quality of the vegetation of sand forest at the Iroquois Woods Nature Preserve (IWNP). According to the Illinois Natural Areas Inventory this preserve contained one of the few high quality mesic upland sand forests in the Kankakee Sand Area (Glass 1991, White 1978). 330</page><page sequence="2">2010 BUSEMEYER ET AL: IROQUOIS WOOD NATURE PRESERVE, ILLINOIS 33 I v I hi n 1 1 ^ x ill LA GRUNDY WILL X /rpPl"?^ ' V^ KANKAKEE '_J^^p^]L - - LIVINGSTON #^eposits WAj[^ I 1 1 IROQUOIS W ^ I FORD Figure 1. Location of Iroquois Woods Nature Preserve in the sand deposits of Kankakee County, Illinois. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY AREA The IWNP, a 19 ha preserve owned by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, is located along the east side of the Iroquois River about 5 km south of Aroma Park, Kankakee County, Illinois (NW1/4 S33 T30N R13W) (Figure 1). This small forest remnant is probably typical of the sand forests that were formally abun- dant along the Iroquois River, and is the most extensive old growth sand forest remnant along this river. Iroquois Woods was dedicat- ed as a nature preserve in 1993 by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (McFall and Karnes 1995). The forests of the northern half of IWNP were "high-graded" before 1993 and stumps in various stages of decomposition were still present. The southern half of the preserve, which is described in this paper, has very little anthropomorphic damage. This part of the preserve contains sand forests of excellent quality (Glass 1991). At the time of the Illinois Natural Areas Inventory (White 1978) this site was considered the best quality timber stand along the Iroquois River. Four distinct forest types occur in the IWNP: wet floodplain forest, wet-mesic sand forest, mesic sand forest, and dry-mesic sand forest (White 1978). The wet floodplain forest consists of a narrow band of relatively young trees next to the Iroquois River channel. Just to the east, and above the wet floodplain forest, is an extensive mesic sand forest on a low terrace. This low terrace is about 5-6 m above the average normal pool of the Iro- quois River channel and extends back from the river for about 200 m where it slowly decreases in elevation becoming a shallow depression (erosion channel) 100 m to 175 m across. The shallow depression is dominated by wet-mesic sand forest. East of this depres- sion is a high sand terrace that extends to the eastern edge of the preserve. This terrace is 8 to 10 m above the normal elevation of the river (183 m) and is dominated by dry-mesic sand forest. The soils of IWNP are mostly fine sand with some areas of fine sandy loam (Paschke 1979). The low terrace consists mostly of Ade loamy fine sand and some Alvin fine sandy loam. Both soils are moderately drained to well drained, and low in organic content, while the original native vegetation was oak-hickory forest. The shallow depression soil is Gilford fine sandy loam, which is poorly drained and high in organic content, while the native vegetation was grasslands or water-tolerant trees. The high sand terrace soils are Oakville fine sand and Chelsa fine sand, both well drained and low in organic content, while oak- hickory forest and/or savanna was the original native vegetation (Paschke 1979). Based on weather data from Kankakee, 8 km to the north, mean annual precipitation</page><page sequence="3">332 CASTANEA Vol. 75 is 98.0 cm, with May having the highest rainfall (11.5 cm). Mean annual temperature is 9.9Â°C with the hottest month being July (average of 23. 6C), and the coldest January (average of -5.7 C). Frost free days range from 141 to 206, with the average being 174 d per year (Midwestern Regional Climate Cen- ter 2009). METHODS During the growing seasons of 2004 and 2005 IWNP was visited numerous times. For all plant species encountered voucher specimens were collected, and habi- tat data were recorded. The voucher speci- mens were processed and deposited in the herbarium of the Illinois Natural History Survey, Champaign, Illinois (ILLS) (Appendix I). Criteria for designating Illinois non-native species followed Mohlenbrock (2002), and Gleason and Cronquist (1991), nomenclature followed Mohlenbrock (2002), while endan- gered and threatened species designation followed Herkert and Ebinger (2002). During summer of 2004, an east/west transect 175 m by 425 m was established in the southern half of IWNP and was surveyed by dividing this transect into 119 contiguous quadrats 25 m on a side (7.44 ha). This transect was placed in the best quality forest on the preserve and extended from the low terrace near the Iroquois River channel at the western edge of the preserve to within 50 m of the preserves eastern edge. In each quadrat all living- and dead-standing woody stems &gt;10.0 cm dbh. were identified and their diameters recorded. From these data, the living-stem density (stems/ha), basal area (m2/ha), relative density, relative dominance, importance value (I.V.), and average diame- ter (cm) were calculated for each species. Determination of the I.V. follows the proce- dure used by Mclntosh (1957), and is the sum of the relative density and relative dominance (basal area). Dead-standing stem density (stems/ha), basal area (m2/ha), and average diameter were also determined. Woody understory composition and density (stems/ha) were determined using nested circular plots 0.0001, 0.001, and 0.01 ha in size. The nested plot centers were located at 20 m intervals along each line transect through the study area. Four additional 0.0001 ha circular plots were located 6 m from the center points along cardinal com- pass directions. In the 0.0001 ha plots, woody seedlings (&lt;50 cm tall) and all shrubs were counted; in the 0.001 ha circular plots small saplings (&gt;50 cm tall and &lt;2.5 cm dbh) were recorded; and in the 0.01 ha circular plots large saplings (2.5-&lt;10.0 cm dbh) were tallied. Within each of the three study areas 28 to 42 nested circular plots were tallied. RESULTS A total of 190 taxa in 137 genera and 69 families were documented to occur on IWNP (Appendix I). Pteridophytes were rep- resented by 6 species. Of the remaining taxa, 38 were monocots in 7 families, and 146 were dicots in 59 families. Illinois non-native (exotic) species accounted forl7 taxa, about 9% of the species collected. No state endan- gered or threatened species were observed. Three relatively distinct topographic zones exist within IWNP (low terrace, shallow depression, high sand terrace). The overstory vegetation of these zones, however, is very similar with most of the same species occur- ring in each (Tables 1 and 2). Low terrace (56 quadrats/3. 5 ha). Located near the edge of the Iroquois River channel, on a lower terrace about 6 m above average river pool, this mesic sand forest contained 20 species that exceed 10 cm dbh. The dominant species were Quercus rubra (I.V. of 55.5), Tilia americana (I.V. of 29.0), Ulmus rubra (I.V. of 17.8), Aesculus glabra (I.V. of 15.5), and Q. macrocarpa (I.V. of 14.9). Two distinct size classes were present in this part of the forest with oaks having average diameters that exceeded 55 cm dbh. (Table 1). Tilia americana, U. rubra, and A. glabra, in contrast, were well represented in smaller diameter classes as indicated by their high densities (stems/ha) and low average diameters. All three taxa, however, contained individuals that exceeded 45 cm dbh. Understory trees were common and included Aesculus glabra, Asimina triloba, Cercis canadensis, Ostrya virginiana, and Juglans cinerea. The woody understory was relatively dense with numerous woody seedlings (15,287 stems/ha), and the numerous small and large saplings (6,648 stems/ha) produced a dense thicket (Table 2). Asimina triloba and Aesculus glabra seedlings and saplings dominated with the thorny Ribes missouriense also common. Though Quercus rubra dominated the canopy,</page><page sequence="4">2010 BUSEMEYER ET AL: IROQUOIS WOOD NATURE PRESERVE, ILLINOIS 333 Table 1.

Shalloiv Depression (32 quadrats/2.0 ha) . Located between the low and high terrace is a broad erosion channel containing a wet-mesic sand forest with 15 woody species exceeding 10 cm dbh. This depression is rarely more than 1 m below the elevation of the low terrace. Water accumulated in this depression for short periods throughout the year. The woody species encountered were mostly the same as those of the low and high terrace but their densities differed. Quercus bicolor dominated the depression with 50 stems/ha, an average diameter of 58.2 cm dbh., and with an I.V. of 61.5 (Table 1). Also, its basal area (14.171 m2/ ha) accounted for almost half of that found in this part of the forest. Tilia americana (I.V. of 45.5) and Ulmus americana (I.V. of 45.4) were second and third in importance due to the large number of small diameter individuals. Except for the occasional large individual of Quercus macrocarpa, Q. rubra, and Fraxinus lanceolata, the remaining woody species were mostly restricted to the smaller diameter classes and averaged less than 26 cm dbh. The woody understory averaged 15,148 seedlings/ha and</page><page sequence="5">334 CASTANEA Vol. 75 Table 2.

Seedlings of Ulmus americana, Celtis occidentalis, and Fraxinus lanceolata dominated the seedling layer along with the shrubby Ribes missouriense. Though Quercus bicolor dominated the canopy, no saplings of this species were encountered. High Sand Terrace (31 quadrats/ 1 .9 ha). This terrace, about 300 m back from the river, was flat to gently rolling dry-mesic sand forest. Quercus alba was the dominant canopy trees with an I.V. of 56.7 followed by Ulmus americana (I.V. of 31.0), Q. velutina (I.V. of 30.3), Prunus serotina (I.V. of 18.1), and Q. rubra (I.V. of 14.0) (Table 1).

The remaining species were mostly in the smaller diameter classes with average diameters not exceeding 23 cm dbh. Woody seedlings in the dry- mesic sand forest averaged 36,701 stems/ha, the most common Ulmus americana and Ribes missouriense, each with more than 6,000 stems/ha (Table 2). Small and large saplings averaged 2,577 stems/ha accounting for a relatively open understory (Table 2). Tree mortality was low. Though many of the canopy trees are large, relatively few dead large individuals were encountered (Table 3). Elms as a species group had the highest mortality with 1 1.8 stems/ha in the mesic sand forest to a high of 46 stems/ha in the wet-mesic sand forest. Except for the few dead oaks and a large Carya cordiformis encountered, most individu- als were in the smaller diameter classes. Dead- standing tree density ranged from 17.6 stems/ ha in the mesic sand forest, 36.3 stems/ha in the dry-mesic sand forest and 50.5 stems/ha in the wet-mesic sand forest (Table 3). DISCUSSION Sand forests in the Kankakee sand deposits were formerly abundant along most of the Kankakee and Iroquois rivers. Cutting, grazing, fragmentation, and fire suppression has resulted in the destruction of most of these once extensive forests. A few degraded sand forests are still available for study. The Momence Wetlands Land and Water Reserve along the Kankakee River a 31 hectare dry-mesic sand forest was exam- ined (Phillippe et al. 2003). The overstory of this forest contained five species with Quercus velutina dominant (I.V. of 109), followed by Q. alba (I.V. of 53.9) and Prunus serotina (I.V. of 34.1). Tree density averaged 252 stem/ha and basal area averaged 22.29 m2/ha. In contrast, the forest communities at the IWNP were more mesic than the sand forests studied at the Momence Wetlands, with higher species diversity, more mesic species, and a dense, more diverse understory. In both of these nature preserves, however, Ribes missouriense was a common species indication that both preserves were heavily grazed in the past. The differences in species composition of the overstory and woody understory of the three topography and vegetation zones of the IWNP were undoubtedly due to difference in soil moisture, elevation, distance from the river, and the extent of flooding. Although most of the common overstory species occur in all three zones, their importance differs. In the low terrace and depression many of the overstory species are those associated with mesic sites and are mostly shade-tolerant and fire-sensitive. In contrast, the high terrace is mostly dominant by shade-intolerant, fire- resistant species (Table 1). Although the IWNP has high species diver- sity, the lack of oak regeneration is of concern. The high number of large oaks in the sand forest communities at IWNP, along with almost total lack of small and large saplings of the oak species, indicates that a shift in species composition is taking place. The results will be a reduction in the abun-</page><page sequence="7">336 CASTANEA Vol. 75 dance of shade-intolerant, fire-resistant oaks, and a continued increase in the more mesic species that are fire-sensitive, but shade- tolerant. Presently, oaks are common in the larger diameter classes because of recruitment from smaller diameter classes. Oak reproduc- tion, however, is sparse, and as veteran oaks die, fewer oaks will be available to fill canopy gaps (Ebinger 1986). In contrast, mesic, shade-tolerant species, many with a high gap-phase-replacement-potential, will take advantage of these canopy openings. I WNP is very different today compared to the early 1800s due to influences by modern man, and a reduced fire frequency followed by a total absence of fire in recent decades (Taft 1997). Frequent fires in pre-settlement times were probably responsible for maintaining a rela- tively open forest with some oak reproduction and recruitment into the canopy (Ebinger and McClain 1991, McCain and Elzinga 1994). It is likely that the present dry-mesic sand forest of the high terrace was a mesic savanna commu- nity in pre-settlement times. Fire frequency and intensity dictated oak density in this pre- settlement landscape (Anderson 1991, Abrams 1992). The compositional stability of these open forest communities indicates that open habitat necessary for the reproduction of oak species was being maintained in early settle- ment times. It is unlikely that management, short of removing nearly all of the shade- tolerant and fire-sensitive species, will be sufficient to create large enough opening for oak regeneration. This may be possible for the dry-mesic sand forest on the high terrace at the IWNP. It is more likely, however, that this community, like in most present day Illinois forests, the oak and hickory will be replaced by sugar maple and other more mesic tree species. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank the Illinois Department of Natural Resources for an Illinois Wildlife Preservation Fund grant to complete this study and their staff for help and encouragement, particular- ly for historical information about IWNP. Also, the review of the manuscript by Randy Nyboer, Illinois Natural Area Inventory, was very helpful. LITERATURE CITED Abrams, M.D. 1992. Fire and the develop- ment of oak forests.
