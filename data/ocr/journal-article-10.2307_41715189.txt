Rich University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee Medcin F èy and Postmodernism: The Root of the Rituals Introduction The language of the Caribbean artist does not originate in the obsession with celebrating his inner self; this inner self is inseparable from the future evolution of his community. But what the artist expresses, reveals, and argues in his work, the people have not ceased to live in reality [T]he artist acquires a capacity to reactivate. . . . Art for us has no sense of the division of genres. This conscious research creates the possibility of a collective effervescence. If he more or less succeeds, he makes critical thought possible; if he succeeds completely, he can inspire.1 Art museums and galleries typically portray a limited experience of art to the public consumer. Paintings and sculptures are the primary media that collectors gather and present, and these paintings and sculptures were made primarily by academically trained artists. In the West, these academies are usually based on post-Renaissance European traditions. However, postmodern theories have expanded the artistic tradition to include other media that is not necessarily housed, or preserved, within walls. With roots in Dada and Abstract Expressionism, performance art and temporary installations (including earthworks) have also been included in the list of the possibilities of visual experiences. Performances and installations are necessarily temporal in nature, impossible to duplicate, and highly dependent upon the results of the artist's movements through space. Therefore, these kinds of artistic expressions are so time- and space-specific that if the audience is not present to observe the process, s/he misses the product. Similarly, outside the Western (hemi)sphere, art's rooted themes of myth and tradition deviate from the "classical idea of art as the history of creative spirits and timeless masterpieces."2 Individual innovation is not the point. Reassuring and reissuing balance and harmony and tradition</page><page sequence="2">72 Sara A. Rich to the community as a whole takes precedence over the demonstration of individual will. Cultural values are transferred through time via "special objects of exchange and ritual, the songs and the spoken stories."3 However, publications on Haitian art in particular have not always adequately represented this difference. If a student of art were to walk into a library searching for books on art made in Haiti, s/he would encounter several histories of the "Haitian Renaissance" and museum catalogues of exhibitions. However, as this essay will show, reading these books will probably not provide a complete picture of the artistic process in Haiti because most discussions are limited to more traditionally accepted media, i.e., painting and sculpture, which can conveniently be transferred across the Caribbean Sea to tell stories of the Haitian experience in faraway lands, despite their inherently limited voice. Artistic Constructions Seiden Rodman attributes "the miracle of Haitian art" to DeWitt Peters, who arrived in Port-au-Prince in 1943 and opened Haiti's first Arts Center the following year.4 The Centre d'Art furnished art supplies, instruction, and studio space in exchange for exotic paintings and sculptures that were sold to European and American collections.5 "The primitives" and their "charming naïveté" appealed greatly to Western collectors who saw surreal perspectives and vivid color schemes in paintings, and forceful grace in the shapes of iron sculptures.6 Searching for latent aspects of their own identity, Westerners embraced the "folk art" of Haiti, importing, exhibiting, reproducing, selling, and ultimately owning mass quantities of the portable and consumable creations.7 Part of the value of these works and their artists lay in the idea that they were untainted, pure, and estranged from the familiar routines of complimentary colors, single-point perspective, and Christian symbolism found in much of Western art.8 For example, Rodman writes of Philomé Obin's Western contact, "Fortunately, however, his brief apprenticeship to a visiting French drawing master was so brief and took place so very long ago- probably when the eighty-year-old artist was in his twenties- that no damage was done."9 But if the truth be told, the instruction that the Centre d'Art students received did change their handling of the material, both physically and mentally. For example, Peters apparently tried to convince Hector Hippolyte to slow down, thus changing the style of his paintings which were described as "childish. . . and the execution was crude, giving evidence of the speed with which they had been painted."10 Hippolyte did not</page><page sequence="3">Medcin Fèy &amp; Postmodernism: The Root of the Rituals 73 slow down, but Peters was able to convince him to include anthropomorphic and zoomorphic forms in his dream-derived landscapes which had been devoid of such "playful imagery" prior to his work at the Centre. This is but one example of the mental reconstruction that occurs with outside influence, altering both the artist's intention and his translation of inspiration. Since at least the 1990s, art museums and galleries have provided viewing and reading audiences with summaries of Haitian art. The Davenport Museum of Art in Iowa, the Milwaukee Art Museum, and UCLA's Fowler Museum of Cultural History all boast impressive collections of Haitian art and have published catalogues thereof. In 1992, the Milwaukee Art Museum published A Haitian Celebration , a catalogue in which the artwork discussed is separated into three groups: history, daily life, and religion. Paintings in the history section depict scenes of colonization, enslavement, and political riots. The daily life segment is devoted to paintings of families, markets, and farming. Likewise, the chapter on religion in Haitian art has more explicit imagery in paint and metalwork of Vodou celebrations, mythical scenes with lwa, and syncretizing images of crosses and sacrifice.11 The problem with this method of categorization lies in its Western modes of thinking. In the minds of most Haitians, there is no difference between history, daily life, and religion. Service to the spirits, as the Vodou adept would say, permeates all aspects of daily life and has played an undeniably important role in the history of the island. Therefore, although it may not be obvious to the outsider, more subtle religious symbolism is at the heart of even the most secular-in-appearance paintings. Marc A. Christophe claims, [A] painting need not necessarily portray an aspect of Vodou rituals or specifically express a Vodou narrative to be influenced by the Vodou religion. . . . The subject of a painting may seem to have no connection whatsoever with Vodou, yet under scrutiny one may discover that the artist's sensibility and aesthetics were influenced unconsciously by cultural factors that still emerge in the work.12 Even Ute Stebich, author of the Milwaukee Art Museum's catalogue, acknowledges that the symbolism can be subtle, even misleading: "In Haitian art, still-lifes of flowers or fruit often have a dual meaning. . . . Painting flowers and fruit is like asking Erzulie to be on your side."13 Arbitrary categories tend to misrepresent Haitian culture, and by doing so, they misconstrue meaning for the viewer and reader. In the following years, museum curators became more sensitive to the holistic reality of Haitian art, instead of limiting the discussions to portable</page><page sequence="4">74 Sara A. Rich paintings and sculptures and creating somewhat arbitrary categories. In 1995, Davenport curator Brady M. Roberts teamed up with renowned Vodou scholar Karen McCarthy Brown to assemble a collection of ethnographic essays that complement the museum's collection of Haitian art.14 The book reproduces paintings and sculptures in the collection, but it also elucidates alternative artforms that thrive in Haiti. The catalogue successfully draws attention to vèvè, drawings made of cornmeal that refer to various Iwa, poured from the hands of manbo and houngan. Also featured are the site- specific murals that color the walls of urban Haiti, painted by anonymous hands that translate political messages to all who pass by. In doing so, Brown and Roberts commemorate the authentic act of art in Haiti, not just the consumable product, purchased by members of the upper-class, donated to museums, and preserved and presented for Western-educated eyes. The same year that the Davenport collection was published alongside Karen McCarthy Brown's ethnographic essays, UCLA's Fowler Museum of Cultural History also published its important volume on Haitian art.15 Brown also contributed an essay to this catalogue, and its organization is similar to that of the Davenport museum's catalogue, although probably four times its length. This book contains information and images on paintings and sculptures from the museum's collection, in addition to items that, even removed from their context, emblemize the often-ignored visual aspects of Haitian culture. These objects include Karnival costumes, assort (the decorated gourds filled with bones and seeds that are used by manbo and houngan as rattles during dances), dolls, altars, photographs of vèvè and dances, and pakéts kongo (Haitianized mnkisi figures made from decorated gourds). All these objects refer to their ceremonial and religious functions, and the accompanying ethnographic text of the catalogue serves to place them within a cultural context. This volume helps the reader to better understand the breadth of Haitian art, and thus the Haitian experience, by placing value on the space and time that artists, participants, and audiences consume- not just the object itself. To the Haitian Vodou adept, or servant of the spirits, the object cannot be divorced from the actions surrounding it. For example, handmade cloth dolls with knotted strings tied around them are not useful unless they are hung from trees in cemeteries- upside down to dissolve the relationship and right-side up to ensure its health- or bound together with string- facing each other to hold the relationship or facing apart to end it.16 Likewise, there is no reason for having an altar unless it is used to make sacrifices to the Lwa, and there is no reason to have an asson if it is not used in ceremony. Claudine Michel writes, "In the same fashion that words acquire meaning through action, deeds accompanied by words, songs, and music become</page><page sequence="5">Medcin Fèy &amp; Postmodernism: The Root of the Rituals 75 more inclusive, more encompassing, and turn into a compelling creative production. . ."17 The same could be said for objects, that is, they accumulate meaning through utilization. Performance, Ritual, and Konesans The function of art is to inform and inspire, transform and translate, reflect and reform, challenge and change, seduce and satiate. It is a form of communication that manifests itself visually, through imagery, performance, and text. It is produced and received and reproduced. It is both process and product. In Haiti, artistic action revolves around what Claudine Michel terms "oral performance." She claims that "through family memories, tales, metaphoric images, proverbs, songs, prayers, and various other spiritual and artistic expressions," Vodou denies the Aristotelian idea of "art for art's sake."18 LeGrace Benson, specialist of art in Haiti, writes on the work of art as an entity: "The product of the individual or collaborative processes results in some entity that necessarily is the product of individual insight, perception, knowledge, and skill put to work." In Haiti, this "individual insight, perception, knowledge, and skill" is referred to as konesans. Claudine Michel defines the Creole term as such: "Konesans means knowledge, but the Creole term is stronger than its English counterpart in that it encompasses the notions of experience mixed with wisdom, usually acquired with age. Typically, elders, houngan and manbo, the departed, and ancestors have much konesans."19 She goes on to explain that each member of the Haitian Vodou community with konesans also has a sense of individual style, which is the "adept's own voice through which is revealed the beauty of the social and spiritual message." Those with konesans are artists, and the "mastery of various styles in rituals and ritualizing and an artistically balanced life" leads to "parameters enhancing religious beliefs, rituals, experiences, and healing."20 The idea of healing, as opposed to curing, is essential to life and culture in Haiti and other Afro-Caribbean islands.21 In the African tradition, healing, as a collaborative artistic process, is a social act and frequently requires the efforts of the entire community.22 As an individual process executed by someone with "much konesans," healing attacks the taproot of the problem, namely social imbalance, and the healer does not differentiate between physical, emotional, and psychological maladies.23 Healers, like artists in the West, use metaphors to address the audience by referring to smells, tastes, and colors that refer to, or symbolize, ideas and memories. Also similar to Western artists, there is much value placed on the level of manipulation of the materials in order to create the product.24 For example, a Vodou altar is described as the equivalent of an</page><page sequence="6">76 Sara A. Rich apothecary, except that the way in which the objects on it are organized, and thus observed and received by the suppliant, is also part of the healing process. Robert Farris Thompson articulates, "Many vodun altars are built in rising tiers upon which myriad objects, crowded and stained with actual use, impress the beholder with a sense of spiritual aliveness and activity."25 The importance of the objects having been visibly used repeated times, stained with various fingerprints and darkened with age, cannot be understated. Farris Thompson further asserts, "The power of these altars lies in their representation of complex ideas by specially selected objects."26 Again, the healer's particularity in choosing certain materials over others, as well as the emphasis on human manipulation of those materials, shares definitive characteristics with Western artistic values. Therefore, the materials and techniques are just as important if not more so than the final outcome; indeed the product could not exist without the process. Max Beauvoir, a respected houngan, reports that phytotherapy ( medsin fèy), must be conducted under proper conditions ( règleman ). The healer must have the full cooperation of the materials to be used to ensure their effectiveness, and this could include prayers and songs during collection, or it could be dependent upon atmospheric conditions and lunar cycles.27 As Lévi-Strauss concluded, the artist is somewhere between scientist and "bricoleur."28 Beauvoir seconds this notion by reporting the complex proportions and quantities of materials in Vodou remedies, and recognizing the final product as unique. No two remedies could ever be the same, just as no two maladies are ever the same. Move san (bad blood), or sometimes called pedisyson (blood loss), is an illness that primarily strikes Haitian women living in poverty.29 It plagues females of child-bearing age, vexes medical doctors, and threatens the lives of unborn children across rural Haiti. Western medical doctors call it "arrested pregnancy syndrome," in which women, although according to some Haitian healers, it can affect men as well, experience what is commonly believed to be a stubborn fetus that refuses to be delivered and can stay in the mother's womb for years, causing a variety of symptoms. Although medical doctors may argue, the condition is at least partially due to the extreme stresses that are inflicted upon women, particularly those in the lower socio- economic strata.30 Abuse, malnutrition, and financial burdens could lead to a variety of health conditions such as miscarriage, infertility, and still-births that can in turn lead to move san.31 In one case study, ethnographer Paul Farmer observed a patient's experience with the condition and its cure. A midwife, or sajfanm, named Mme. Victor succeeded in doing what others</page><page sequence="7">Medcin Fèy &amp; Postmodernism : The Root of the Rituals 77 could not- curing Ti Malou of move san.32 The sajfanm described in great detail the procedure for creating the remedy for Ti Malou: To make the remedy, you soak the roots of bwa let , the roots of kayimit, bwa jon, and coconut, and the leaves of sorosi and fey sezi. If the person with move san is a woman with a nursing baby and her milk has gone bad, you need to add the leaves and roots of bwa let and also to add one small spoonful of the spoiled milk to the bottle [that contains the remedy]. This is for the person to drink, and will separate the blood from the milk .... But there's more to it than that: you must buy a piece of white soap and a coconut, a bit of coffee, a measure of black beans, and then you bring down the blood (fe let la desann). You grill the coffee together with the black beans and seven grains of salt. When you've finished grilling, you grind it up in a mortar and put it in a pan, add water, and mix it up. From this you make a compress for both the brow and the back of the head, and keep it moist with the concoction all day long.... You can also place an empty shallow basket on the person's head, and pour the medicine in the basket; it will run down over the head and body. Each time you dampen the compress also rub down her arms and legs with the medicine. Do this for a week or so. Also put a grain of virgin salt [from a box that has not been used for cooking] in the palm of each hand. Place a grain of salt under each of [the patient's] feet and stand on a palm leaf. She must stand still. This will make the milk return to its rightful place.33 Mme. Victor also maintained that this remedy was only a starting point- variations are dependent upon the patient-audience's individual needs and condition. The level of performance involved in this case should be apparent. The healer-artist makes a specialized tea with herbs and the spoiled breast milk of the patient-audience. This patient receives the tea and ingests it. The healer-artist then combines seemingly incompatible elements - soap, coconut, coffee, and black beans- into a compress for the patient to use on her head. As an alternative, Mme. Victor advises placing a small basket on the patient's head and pouring the medicine inside, allowing it to run down her head and body. Her arms and legs are also massaged with medicine in what would certainly be felt as a sensory overload for the patient- audience- the smells of the ingredients, the sounds of prayers and songs,</page><page sequence="8">78 Sara A. Rich the feeling of being at the center of a ritualized healing performance. The patient must also hold a grain of "virgin" salt in each hand and under each foot while standing very still on a palm leaf. The level of concentration and even meditation that this aspect of the performance requires is enough to inspire a student of art history to reassess her own level of engagement with this encounter. In this case, there is a fairly strict separation between the role of the healer-artist and that of the patient-audience, but in other cases, that delineation is more blurred. Occasionally, the healer-artist transfers artistic licensure (and thus power) to the patient-audience. Karen McCarthy Brown provides an example of a woman named Ti-Klou who was experiencing problems with her lover Hubert, who could be verbally and physically abusive at times.34 Ti-Klou's emotions were deceptive- sometimes she wanted Hubert out of her life completely, and at other times she wanted him back. The healer-artist instructed the woman to take three baths, one every three days, without washing between them. Every three days, Ti-Klou came to the healer who made a bath for her patient-audience. The first bath consisted of heated milk and spices, mainly cinnamon. The second bath was heavy with perfumes and liquors. The third bath contained rose petals, champagne, and perfume. She was instructed to wash from the feet toward the head and to dry off very gently afterward. While in the bath, she was to hold a lit candle and pray. The rest of the "magic" was up to Ti-Klou. After each bath was created by the healer-artist, she passed the artistic licensure to Ti-Klou (thereby changing the role of the healer-artist into that of the audience). The patient-healer receives, temporarily (and then finally), not just artistic licensure, but also responsibility and (re)creative power over her own body, and thus her own life. Ti-Klou took the first bath of milk and spices, praying and moving the warm emulsion from her feet upward. She emerged smelling of spoiled milk. She cried all night, riddled with sadness over her lost love. During the second bath of perfume and liquor, her eyes and genitals stung and she emerged furious. She even called Hubert in the middle of the night and yelled at him, and the next day he came to her house where they continued to fight until the neighbors intervened. The third bath of roses and champagne left a more subtle mark on the patient- audience-artist. After washing herself in the perfumed water, Ti-Klou felt herself stronger, more resistant, and independent. The healer-artist-audience watched as Ti-Klou relived in nine days three phases of life: infancy, puberty, and adulthood. Through the act of washing, the patient-audience-artist used the product to make her own process, her own performance out of it, thus reinventing her own identity.</page><page sequence="9">Medcin Fèy &amp; Postmodernism: The Root of the Rituals 79 In some cases, the artist-healer's audience is both internal and external. Karen McCarthy Brown also provides another example of a marriage on the rocks because of the husband's temper. In an effort to "cool down" and "sweeten" her husband, the wife could place ice and a little sugar syrup in ajar that also contains a slip of paper with his name written on it several time. The jar is then inverted, the basic signal within the Vodou science of the concrete that a situation is to be changed. . . . She lights a candle by the jar, prays over it, and concentrates her energy on the desired end.35 Similarly, a wo/man could place the name of the loved one in a bottle and wrap it tightly with butcher's twine "until it looks like a little mummy" to ensure that the lover will stay.36 Another alternative is by using repetition to make the lover return, such as counting an exact number of straight pins (eg., three piles of precisely 101 pins), and saying "I want [insert name] to come back to me" as the forlorn lover pushes each pin into a lit black candle.37 In this way, both lovers are audience members; even though the lover whose name was written or repeated aloud may not know of the existence of the artistic product, both lovers see the result of artistic manipulation and performance unfold before them. Conclusion This essay has been an effort to help fill the lacuna that Robert Storr exposed in Art in America when he said that "in the absence of any sustained research into what artists of color and others outside the mainstream might be up to, such [postmodern] discussions become rootless instead of radical."38 Ultimately, the relationship between ritual and art could be summarized by the idea of performance, that is, the movement of the artist who is "generally concerned with communication" and who "makes use of out-of-context elements, redirecting ordinary elements (for example colours, sounds, words) into a configuration in which they become more than ordinary."39 As the Vodou healer-artist combines dissimilar ingredients to heal- not just cure- the patient-audience, the healer certainly embodies this definition of one who makes art. The other feature of art that must not be forgotten is the characteristic of audience reception. As one Sri Lankan anthropologist suggests, "[T]he readiness of perceivers to respond to regularity, rhythm and other predictable structural elements in time and space would predispose them also to respond to changes in these elements, especially in art when the reception of . . . tension and release [are] important to aesthetic response."40 Without an</page><page sequence="10">80 Sara A. Rich audience, does the art process /product exist? As was shown in the example of Ti-Malou, the woman suffering from move san, the patient-audience held a passive role in the performance, allowing the healer-artist to use the process and product on her, while she remained relatively still, receiving change as it was directed at her. However, the example of Ti-Klou showed a different aspect of the artist-audience, or healer-patient, relationship. In that case, the artist-healer transferred power in the form of artistic licensure over to the patient-audience, thus switching the relationship and making the artist-healer into the audience and the patient-audience into the artist. The result was that the patient-audience-artist was able to transform herself, via performance between the rounds of process/product made by the healer- artist turned audience. Finally, in the third example of healer-artist and patient-audience relationships, the healer-artist is also the audience, along with the other recipient of the healing process, despite the fact that s/he may not be aware of the existence of the healing product. The confusion of these binary categories is characteristic of Vodou culture, in which there exists no separation of sacred and secular, physical and mental, man and god, or heaven and earth. In terms of Vodou healing rituals specifically, this essay has also shown that there is not necessarily a differentiation between healer and patient, artist and audience, or product and process. In postmodern terms, Jaques Derrida would certainly approve of the Haitian disregard of binary oppositions, and thus their inherent hierarchies, that are unfailingly predominant in Western ideologies and languages.41 Those who can dismiss the commonly-held notion of an elitist artform that holds the essence of timeless beauty, can begin "to regard the history of art as a process of production and reception, in which not identical functions but dialogical structures of question and answer mediate between past and present.'1*2 Given the reality of the past and present in Haiti, bell hooks' words on postmodernism in Black communities ring true: One can talk about what we are seeing, thinking, or listen- ing to; a space is there for critical exchange. It's exciting to think, write, talk about, and create art that reflects passionate engagement with popular cultures, because this may very well be 'the' central future location of resistance struggle, a meeting place where new and radical happen- ings can occur.43 Perhaps this meeting place for critical exchange lies, not behind the walls of academic institutions or gallery spaces, but in Glissant's "collective effervescence," cited at the beginning of this essay. The reactivation of</page><page sequence="11">Medcin Fèy &amp; Postmodernism: The Root of the Rituals 8 1 community has the potential to inspire, certainly, but also to make possible a collection of critical thinkers- and what "radical happenings" could then occur.

Of course Haitian art is also laced with Christian symbolism because of the influence of the Catholic Church on the island's inhabitants since the beginning of its European occupation in the seventeenth century. However, the impact of the symbols is sometimes subdued by the dominating imagery of the lwa and their associated objects and animals, and other times it carries a double meaning (eg., substitute Christian cross for Vodou kalfou). 10 Christenson 1975, 48, citing Peters' Art in Haiti. 11 Stebich 1992.
