Their words fly over land and main, Their warblings make the distance glad, Their voices heard hereafter add A glory to a glorious reign. (Alfred, Lord Tennyson, from ‘To the Queen’ (1851))1 To begin, imagine yourself  travelling the widely separated yet curiously inter- twined city streets of  what was once the hectically cross-connected, world- enveloping British Empire circa 1899, or 1914, or 1919. You are walking along Pulteney Street in Adelaide, say, or Adderley Street in Cape Town, or Park Street, Calcutta, or down Yonge Street towards the waterfront in downtown Toronto. What do you see around you? In all cases you find the expansive  pavements or sidewalks, the generously proportioned streets, the ample shop awnings, the painted wrought-iron pilasters — the commercial street furniture of  an empire of  shopkeepers. But now look more closely: glance, and glance again, to overcome the geographical vertigo you suddenly feel, this overwhelming sense of  déjà vu. Where was it again you said I was? you ask. Is this Sydney or Victoria,  Wellington or Kingston, Harare or Calcutta? I could be in the one, you say; I could be in the other. Not only the architectural motifs and the street names, but also the urban layout and the statuary, the sandstone or bluestone World War memorials, the societies, banks, and other institutions that stand squat and large on Main Street or High Street: all are repeated or find their resonance in urban centres thousands of miles apart. Squint slightly and it seems that these  different names and designs are on the move, imperceptibly changing place, circulating from one context to another. Here is the Temperance Society hall, Adelaide, with its Roman temple frontage and ionic columns; there is the Egyptian Building in the Gardens, Cape Town, decorated in sphinx and compass motifs, long the meeting house of  the city’s Freemasons. But Cape Town, too, has its Temperance Society, and Adelaide its Freemasons’ building, 1Tennyson: A Selected Edition, ed. by Christopher Ricks (Harlow: Longman, 1989), pp. 986–87. </page> <page sequence="2"> 041-057_YES41_2_Boehmer_160 x 235mm  26/04/2011  20:37  Page 42 42 The Worlding of  the Jingo Poem its local headquarters or meeting hall of  the Legion of  Frontiersmen or of  the British Legion — as do Montreal, Harare, Auckland, Melbourne, Nairobi. And many if  not all share similar architectural motifs, the Roman references, the Victorian wrought-iron curlicues, or the characteristic insignia of  Freemasonry. And many if  not all of  these cities will also have their Anglican cathedral, their Society of  Friends meeting hall, their branch of  the Theosophical Society, as well as their great dockyards and river fronts, railway stations and colonial  exhibition halls, and their vast municipal graveyard full of  standard-issue white marble crosses on staggered pedestals, now yellowing and rain-stained, marked with Old and New Testament and Anglo-Saxon names. On or around 1914, the Empire at its height, powered by what Gary Magee and Andrew Thompson call ‘the British World economy’,2 animated by the ceaseless mass migration of  British peoples across the nineteenth century — the ‘new’ Empire resembled nothing so much as a great circumlocution both of ideas and of  things; a vast intercontinental flow chart of  trade, commodities, money, technologies, or what Rudyard Kipling designated the ‘stimulants of  the West’.3 Sharing features with what we term globalization today (despite the increase in intensity of  present-day circuitry), this Victorian world-interchange was convoluted and deeply embedded, emerging out of  a complicated history of  ‘transoceanic and transcontinental trade, travel, and conquest’, as well as the new ‘communications revolution’ brought by steam locomotion and the tele- graph.4 Institutions, organizations, and societies branched and ramified along the great routes of  transcolonial exchange and trade, and with them moved  travelling individuals and migrating families, social mores and ways of  cultural doing, fads, fashions, urban designs, Manchester goods and dress patterns, books, rifles, foodstuffs, print technologies, playground games, and also, as this essay will explore, literary genres and poetic forms, in particular the arch-poem of  empire — the jingoist verse, or what I shall more inclusively call the ‘jingo poem’.5 2Gary B.

I am indebted at this point in the essay to discussions with Konstantin Sofianos on the Victorian novel in the context of  imperial globalization. 5 Jingoism and poetry are often deemed antonymic terms, with jingoist verse being the term in widespread general use. Although it lacks historical currency, the resonantly assonantal phrase ‘jingo poem’ permits  reference to the more strident imperialist work of  Rudyard Kipling and W. E. Henley, among other canoni- cal names, though does not exclude the rabid jingoist verse with which their work existed in dialogue. The expression ‘by Jingo’ was first used in a music hall song by G. W. Hunt in 1878. </page> <page sequence="3"> 041-057_YES41_2_Boehmer_160 x 235mm  26/04/2011  20:37  Page 43 elleke boehmer 43 Although the jingo poem has never drawn the same critical attention as an ideo- logical vehicle of  empire as has the more generically varied imperial adventure story, verse acclaiming British values and exhorting Britons to follow the flag, this essay submits, acted as both a powerful catalyst and a conduit for imperial- ist attitudes. Indeed, within the increasingly more complicated global webs and circuits of  the expanding empire, the jingo poem — tub-thumping and also anthemic, exhortatory but at times elegiac — provided sources of  inspiration and sustaining intimations of  fellow feeling, strongly and evocatively expressed. Whereas the novel provided a symbolic cartography, however incomplete, of that expanding world, the jingo poem, never so spatialized or so nuanced, offered incentives on an emotional level. Whenever the imperial going got tough, or imperial conviction quailed, the poem acted as a morale booster, a sharp, verbal shot in the arm. Moreover, from its inception the jingo poem, with its often idealized and emblematized subject matter (lauding British Strength, Honour, Endurance) and its strong mnemonic features, its tuneful repetitions and infectious balladic and hymn-like resonances, was a portable form that unfixed easily from wherever it was first heard, proclaimed, or published. Traversing colonial borderlines and ocean spaces, migrating, as refrain, from music hall to newspaper page, and, as exhortatory rhetoric, from the œuvre of one colonial versifier to that of  another, the poem carried not only British imperial convictions but also British nationalist feelings, projected on to a global stage. In his account of  the accelerated formation of  ‘inter-national networks’ at the end of  the nineteenth century, C. A. Bayly complicates the received histor- ical picture of  an unprecedentedly interconnected imperial world by proposing that the speeded-up empire-building of  this period in fact animated and extended already existing global networks.6 He also adds, importantly, that this internationalized system was fuelled by the expansionist ambitions of  nation states, including Britain; that high imperialism, in other words, has always been at base a nationalist formation. Yet nationalist ambition, his analysis recognizes, is not a lone vehicle of  empire.7 For Bayly, the development of  these at once imperialist yet ‘inter-national’ networks is expressed through three dominant registers: ideology (such as in the spread of  nationalist and liberal ideas), human diaspora, and forms of  bodily practice. His analysis, however, misses a crucial fourth category, that of  aesthetic form. The operations of  the popular jingo poem among other imperial genres, this essay contends, can be seen to demonstrate 6 C. A. Bayly, The Birth of  the Modern World, 1780–1914: Global Connections and Comparisons (Oxford: Blackwell, 2004). 7 Capitalism is, of  course, another crucial motor force, though a less important element in Bayly’s analysis than is nationalism. </page> <page sequence="4"> 041-057_YES41_2_Boehmer_160 x 235mm  26/04/2011  20:37  Page 44 44 The Worlding of  the Jingo Poem persuasively the functioning of  Bayly’s ‘inter-national’ networks; to reveal both what moves through these networks and how it moves. If, as Bayly, Colin Graham, Robert MacDonald, and others suggest, imperi- alism as a political idea is typically coterminous with national, racial, and masculinist thinking, then the jingo poem in the time of  high imperialism worked as an important reagent in forging that mix. In other words, it was addressed at once to ‘home’ and to the world. Travelling widely and well along the Empire’s circuitry, it served as a truly ‘inter-national’ and global formation, at one and the same time celebrating national strengths, such as British courage and invincibility, and expounding imperial virtues — brotherhood, white  solidarity. To Lord Milner, for example, empire involved a sense of  national mission that would allow the British to preserve ‘the unity of  [their] great race’.8 Striking the same chord, Rudyard Kipling’s characteristically declamatory ‘A Song of  the English’ (1896) sees British imperialism as founded on a national and racial imperative whereby the expansion of  empire is framed as the fulfil- ment of  the moral destiny of  the British people to rule the world.9 Other cultures — it is the poem’s belief  — are better off  under British rule, and the manly British nation is strengthened and consolidated by imperial expansion. Conventionally, jingoism as a mode of  thinking or feeling is understood as nation-obsessed, closed-minded, xenophobic, and inward-looking. The OED definition of  the ‘jingo’, which emerges in this period, denotes a ‘blustering patriot’ and is associated with war-mongering rhetoric. Yet no matter how strident and single-minded, or indeed how aggressive and nation-obsessed, jingoistic verse was at this time, it nonetheless bore the unmistakable marks of an expansive imperial ideology, and also of  the increasing networking and  capitalization of  the world under empire. Its terms of  address were at once to the British Nation and to the wider British Empire — to Britons around the globe — and its operations took as read a global map. Following on from Colin Graham’s suggestion in his discussion of  Victorian epic that ‘from the middle to the end of  the nineteenth century the “nation” is the conceptual force which pushes, justifies and underlies imperialism’, the jingo poem at the century’s end provided a key medium through which that force was expressed.10 Like the imperial adventure story, the jingo poem was predicated on the ‘worlding’ both of  British society and of  its national literature, in precisely the opposite way to how the etiolated decadent poetry that equally defined the fin de 8 See Laurence Kitzan, Victorian Writers and the Image of  Empire: The Rose-Colored Vision (Westport, CT:  Greenwood Press, 2001), p. 43. 9 Rudyard Kipling, ‘A Song of  the English’, in The Definitive Edition of  Rudyard Kipling’s Verse (1949; repr.

It was fully aware of  taking a British national message to the globe and, simultaneously, of  communicating an imperial world view to the British public. Not unexpectedly, the peak time of  the jingo poem coincided with the popularity of  music hall, to whose refrain-based song structures it was formally indebted.12 Media of  imperial propaganda both, the jingo poem, like music hall verse, was imbued with the certainty that the spread of  British power and values around the world was a powerful good, and that the verse itself  had a part to play in that dissemination. Empire ‘really was’, observe Magee and Thompson, referencing John Darwin and Alan Lester, ‘an interconnected zone constituted by multiple points of  contact and complex circuits of  exchange [. . .] a field of  enterprise for the whole of  British society’.13 A clear instance of  this interconnection is how the jingo poem circulated through the ramifying new networks provided by steamship transport, the cable-based communications media, such as the tele- graph, and also the popular press, which immeasurably speeded up its movement and its reception. So a jingo poem that might be generated in Sydney or Sioux Ste Marie could within weeks be taken up, copied, set to music, reworked, in Vancouver or the Virgin Islands. If  British empire at its height thus effectively represented the ‘first wave’ of  modern globalization, within that  globalized world, I suggest, jingoist verse in English was, before the 1950s pop song, probably one of  the most culturally migrated or ‘worlded’ of  literary genres. On one level it addressed the British world as something akin to a united nation, and yet on another it itself  carried few locatable geographical markers, as stood to reason in a ‘Greater Britain’ interpenetrated and homogenized by English or British cultural meanings (certainly from the vantage point of  the white Greater Britain audiences for whom the poem was intended). Moreover, in tandem with this process whereby the jingo poem established itself  as a 11 I draw the concept of  ‘worlding’ in part from Edward W. Said’s The World, the Text and the Critic (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1983), which sees the text as existing in dynamic relationship with its context, here the expanded imperial world. The concept is refracted also through historical analyses, as above, of  the interconnected colonial world at this time as animated at once by the forces of  capitalism and imperialism. 12 See Barry J.

Represented by such names as Alfred Austin (the Poet Laureate after Tennyson), W. E. Henley, Henry Newbolt, and, above all, the ‘Laureate of Empire’ Rudyard Kipling,14 the heyday of  the jingo poem embraces the two closing decades of  the nineteenth and the early years of  the twentieth century. It was in this period that Kipling not only became the ‘supreme exponent of  his age’, but that he was also deemed, especially in his poetry, to ‘express the imperial idea in its simplest and most powerful form’.15 Tennyson, though an important influence on these later poets, and though he took the national ‘addressivity’ of  his role as Laureate seriously, was no longer a major force during this period of  high imperialism and massive global expansion.16 Moreover, he rarely espoused overt imperialist sentiments, even in his later work, although poems like ‘Locksley Hall Sixty Years After’, following on from the already pessimistic ‘Locksley Hall’ of  the 1840s, are enseamed with anxiety at the decline of  empire.17 The inaugural moment, if  such it can be called, of  the jingo poem, as of jingoism itself, came with the so-called British ‘Great Awakening’ to a sense of imperial destiny that was sparked by the aftermath of  the death of  the national hero General Gordon at Khartoum in 1885. Gordon, a one-time Governor General of  the Sudan, had been overwhelmed by the insurrectionary Islamicist forces of  the charismatic Mahdi in an attempt to withdraw the British garrison from Khartoum, and was widely perceived to have been let down by the British government, who had delayed in dispatching a relief  force to his aid. In 1898, to wide popular enthusiasm, Kitchener’s Omdurman campaign took revenge for the death of  Gordon. That one-and-a-half  decade interim saw the first  publication of  imperialist verse by Henley and by Newbolt, and the meteoric arrival of  the ‘Indian’ Kipling on the London literary stage. The closing episodes of  the jingo poem as a world-penetrating form came with the humiliating defeats of  the Anglo-Boer War (1899–1902), and then with the Liberal landslide of  1906, although these dark days for Tory imperialism were to some extent counter - balanced by the charged ‘jingo’ election of  1900, and the eventual successful suppression of  Swadeshi resistance in Bengal from 1905. 14 ‘Laureate of  Empire’ is W. T. Stead’s name for Kipling; see W. T. Stead, Review of  Reviews, 14 (December 1896), p. 553. It should be noted, however, that Kipling’s poetry is often more conflicted and ambivalent, and certainly more metrically complicated, than the term ‘jingo poem’ might at first suggest. 15MacDonald, Language of  Empire, pp. 145–73 (esp. pp. 149, 145). 16 It was in the final three decades of  the 1800s that, with the acquisition or consolidation of  territories in Africa and South-East Asia, the British Empire came to cover a fifth of  the world’s land surface.

Between 1870 and 1908, for example, the global total of  submarine cables increased nineteenfold, from 24,793 to 473,108.18 The private telegraph companies operating these cable networks, and the international news agencies that depended on them, became ‘among the first transnational corporations’.19 These different world-embracing and speeded-up media were conjoined in the conviction, held both by their owners and their consumers, that the English-speaking colonies (eventually together with the United States) might unite to form a vast ‘Greater Britain’. This planet- spanning, ‘railway-girt’ entity, first conjured up in Charles Dilke’s travelogue Greater Britain of  1868, was further propagated in the writing of  imperial  raconteurs and historians both Liberal and Tory, including J. A. Froude and J. R. Seeley, and not omitting Rudyard Kipling, a lifelong enthusiast of  the idea of  an expanded England linking together the homebound English and the  frontiersmen of  the world.20 Significantly for its worldwide circulation and spread, the growing popular- ity of  the jingo poem in these years coincided not only with the rise of  Greater Britain ideas, but also with the shift from what Anne McClintock calls ‘scientific racism’ to ‘commodity racism’. Towards the end of  the nineteenth century, she argues, in the phase of  high imperialism, ideas of  imperial progress via the struggle of  the fittest gave way to mass-produced spectacles of  racialized ideas, reflected in ‘advertising and photography, the imperial Expositions and the museum movement’,21 and also, I would add, in the popular imperialist and racialized posturing of  the jingo poem, as, most notoriously, in Kipling’s ‘The White Man’s Burden’ (1899).22 Imperial exhibitions during the period, for instance, broadened their primary objective of  imparting a scientific education to the masses and in addition became concerned with commercial entertain- ment. But so, too, the songlike jingo poem bent itself  to the edification and  entertainment of  the masses through its propagation of  imperialist ideas. 18 D. R.

In some cases it acted as a kind of  imprimatur or official stamp of  empire. The jingo poem printed on a teacup or tea towel hypostatized that commodity of  the British Empire as an imperial commodity, in much the same way as logos such as the Nike swoosh ‘tag’ Nike products as global commodities today. Working through these channels, the jingo poem, probably above most other literary genres, assisted in the process of, as Joseph McLaughlin writes, moving ‘Victorian imperialist discourse out of the realm of  the scientific societies and clubs’, and ‘[resituating] it in the commercial and domestic spheres’.23 As a circulating form, the poem joined in with the remarkable new fluidity of  things, styles, and designs, as well as people, in the expanding global marketplace of  late nineteenth-century commercial capitalism. Bard of  empire Kipling’s massively popular music-hall-style ‘Tommy song’ ‘The Absent-Minded Beggar’ (1899) captures precisely this transnational and transcultural circulation of  the jingo poem, in so far as its catchy exhortation to ‘pay — pay — pay’ into the Soldiers Families Fund of  the Anglo-Boer War was widely hummed and sung by soldiers and civilians in Britain and South Africa alike, and also disseminated around the settler colonies on handkerchiefs, mugs, tea towels, jugs, and coasters.24 ‘Cook’s home — Duke’s home — home of  a millionaire’ (as a line from the poem has it) — the different contexts were bound together in their imperialist solidarity by way of  the circulation of  the poem, and of  the movement of  monies inspired by the poem, which in turn confirmed that solidarity. Other of  Kipling’s poetic hits, such as ‘If ’ and ‘Bobs’, were also massively anthologized, reprinted, and reproduced on commodities like hand- kerchiefs and tea sets, and as texts for framing. As the poet, late in his career, recognized in Something of  Myself, the ‘mechanism of  the age’ had succeeded in marketing his work across the world.25 As a consequence of  this dissemination, not only individual poems by Kipling, but also his image and voice as imperial Laureate and singer of  a Greater Britain, were elevated in the public mind, becoming global icons of  a bullish and pushful empire, as well as the objects of admiring imitation (by Edgar Wallace and ‘Banjo’ Paterson, among others). A self-consciously modern poet who also celebrated the railways and cable tech- nologies, Kipling perhaps even more than Dickens was the first writer of  whom it might be said that he was fully worlded. 23 Joseph McLaughlin, Writing the Urban Jungle: Reading Empire in London from Doyle to Eliot (Charlottesville: University Press of  Virginia, 2000), pp. 17–18. 24 Kipling, ‘The Absent-Minded Beggar’, in Definitive Edition, p. 459. 25 Rudyard Kipling, Something of  Myself, ed. by Thomas Pinney (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 111. </page> <page sequence="9"> 041-057_YES41_2_Boehmer_160 x 235mm  26/04/2011  20:37  Page 49 elleke boehmer 49 For Elaine Freedgood in The Ideas in Things, a cultural archive is embedded in the represented things of  Victorian literature.26 Commodities in particular, goods manufactured and traded, the mahogany furniture in Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre, for example, are loaded with a world history of  trade and exchange, a history marked by imperial force fields of  ownership and power. Drawing together several of the threads outlined above, the jingo poem, by contrast with the thing in the Victorian novel, was in its massive popularity at once a circulating form (like the thing), and a form of  circulation (less like it). Arjun Appadurai usefully comments in this regard that in a globalizing world, the circulation of  forms is especially intensified by heightened and accelerated forms of  circulation.27 By these lights the jingo poem can be seen as at once a carrier of  meanings, yet also a means and a mode of  carrying meaning; both a channel of  transference, bearing imperial messages from one colonial site to another, like a telegraph cable, say, and itself  the imperial message. So the jingo poem could also be described as at one and the same time dense with meaning and yet, in its function as channel, strangely empty of  meaning, an unclogged conduit. Much like the commodity within world capitalism, the jingo poem sought out colonial contexts (markets, audiences) that already shared common cultural features through being networked by empire, and then, by way of  its own networking operations, confirmed, embedded, and further homogenized those common features. The characteristic apostrophic and exhortatory mode of  the jingo poem is marked by, and in turn marks, this worlding; the same applies to its broadly disseminated yet highly standardized generic patterns (the ballad stanza espe- cially). The poem invokes the moral values of  the British — chivalry, military honour and courage, good governance, paternalism towards other races — and via this invocation urges British colonials at all social levels to spread these virtues around the world. Yet, at the same time, the poem assumes that these national values are already widely accepted as global goods; that its desideratum is an accomplished fact. The poem’s imperial advocacy, therefore, which in Kipling at times takes the shape of  global warning or admonishment, as in ‘Recessional’ (1897) or ‘The Lesson’ (1901), is also a form of  national reinforcement or repeat recognition. Empire is, again and again, seen for what it is (or ought) to be: the British nation writ large upon the English-speaking world.28 26 Elaine Freedgood, The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the Victorian Novel (Chicago: University of  Chicago Press, 2006). 27 See Arjun Appadurai, Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of  Globalization (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1996) and his edited volume Globalization (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2001).

B.) Paterson, enter into a dialogue with Kipling’s imperialist yet English ‘songs’; where they adapt his language and forms in order to catalyse nationalist sentiment within their own colonial locales. It was a seeming paradox only that the jingo poem’s appeal to the stout heart or the pioneering spirit of  the home country could be enthusiastically embraced in the white English-speaking colonies where the precise same characteristics were transmuted into signifiers of  national spirit. This ready take-up of  the form again reflects how imperialist genres might speak powerfully both to home  audiences and to the world, or the world as a version of  a national homeland, moving fluidly along the spectrum linking imperial and nationalist values.29 Whereas, for the Britain-based imperialist, the jingo poem addressed the expan- sive ambitions of  the nation in so far as its rhetoric at the same time reached out to the world, for the colonial nationalist the reverse situation obtained: the jingo poem, by invoking ‘home’ values, spoke the more dynamically to the world, or to that part of  it he might designate as his new home. The nationalist-imperialist interchange that marks jingoism is palpable in many of  the poems of  ‘Banjo’ Paterson (such as ‘Clancy of  the Overflow’ or ‘The Bushman’s Song’ from The Man from Snowy River), and also in the Canadian Confederation poets Bliss Carman or Charles G. D. Roberts (‘A Vagabond Song’, ‘The Pea-fields’, respectively), in poems that borrow the recognizable shapes of  English popular verse, as propagated by Kipling, among others, to applaud new, fledgling nationalities.30 As this implies, the jingo poem when speaking to the world, spoke particularly strongly and plainly to the outer, male- dominated edges of  that world, to its borderlines and frontiers, its growing mining towns and expanding civil lines. As suited its origins in traditional ballad and campfire song, this was verse that belonged out in the open, and which, when traded and passed on in these far-flung contexts, not only broadcast  imperialist and masculine values, but also, from the vantage point of  the singers and readers of  the songs, helped in some measure to make these places more endurable.31 It was in respect of  its operation as a circulating form of  high imperialism that the jingo poem, with its musical, refrain-based structures and sometimes 29 For further discussion of  the segue between imperial and nationalist values in the Victorian writing of empire, see Kitzan, Victorian Writers and the Image of  Empire. 30 A.

No mere celebratory jingle, the jingo poem drove empire home in memorable phrases. Its power lay in how it worked, simultane- ously, at different ideological, emotional, and visceral levels. Pressing upon its audience popular sentiments in entertaining yet also emotionally charged ways, it invited repetition, citation, reiteration; it ceaselessly flowed and circulated; it itinerated. Its performative features added to its impact: its declamatory public style; the combinatory, collective effects of  its choric forms embodied ideas of race loyalty and solidarity as if  they were part of  the natural order of  things. Like epic, and unlike the lyric, the jingo poem explicitly directed itself  to the political sphere; it did not signify a private, non-social mode of  address. Yet, unlike the ode or epic fragment, say, it did not seek to expound a position within any particular political framework; it was a declarative and not a discursive form, and hence was the more memorable, the more repeatable.32 In some rare cases, a widely reproduced work like Kipling’s ‘The Absent-Minded Beggar’ might become so elevated by the effects of  enthusiastic reiteration as to come to stand as a cipher for a particular political attitude or approach — most usually a fervent pro-imperialism. In his discussion Poetry of  the Period (1870), the (later) Poet Laureate Alfred Austin lamented the bifurcation within contemporary British poetry between ‘great poetry’ and ‘beautiful poetry’, in which the former was addressed to the world of  action, conflict, and public statement.33 Although questions may be asked of  its ‘greatness’ as well as of  its seriousness, the jingo poem that openly conveyed an imperial message, or set out to rouse an imperial response, related to that outer world. While not seeking to embody the complex geography of  the globalizing Empire, it did take as read an imperial stage, which is to say, an  imperialist speaker, a ready-made imperial myth, and a quantity of  imperialist enthusiasm in its audience or readership. In the Victorian novel the global nexuses of  capital, finance, and communications might be figured, say, in terms of  a hero’s arduous and truncated journey to a distant land (H. Rider Haggard’s She), or of  the abstraction of  social space such as was produced within the growing and speeded-up world system (Olive Schreiner’s The Story of  an African Farm).34 Against these constructs, the jingo poem appealed to the heart, and did so in part by insisting on group bonds and group identity (as in Kipling’s ‘A Song of  the English’). One important quality it shared with the adventure tale, 32On the role of  Victorian epic in propagating ideas of  nationality and national cohesion within the nation state, yet more widely also, see Graham, Ideologies of  Epic. 33 Alfred Austin, ‘Summary in The Poetry of  the Period’, in The Victorian Poet, ed. by Joseph Bristow (Beckenham: Croom Helm, 1987), pp. 123–24. 34 See Victorian Visions of  Global Order: Empire and International Relations in Nineteenth-Century Political Thought, ed. by Duncan Bell (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007). </page> <page sequence="12"> 041-057_YES41_2_Boehmer_160 x 235mm  26/04/2011  20:37  Page 52 52 The Worlding of  the Jingo Poem  therefore, was in its emphasis on doing, on an ethic of  action over an ethic of contemplation. In the adventure, this was embodied in derring-do, bushwhack- ing, and other vigorous activity; in the jingo poem, in its characteristic impera- tive mode: Newbolt’s ‘“Play up! play up! and play the game!”’ (from ‘Vitaï Lampada’), for instance, or Kipling’s ‘Take up the White Man’s burden’.35 The jingo poem, as both its mode of  delivery and its social circuitry suggests, is a poem that implies a crowd. It also implies a vertical social structure. By and large it is directed from a leader figure towards a group. The group could comprise a collection of  like-minded if  more junior imperialists, drawn from the same social class as the speaker, or it might entail the greater British public. As stands to reason, high-minded ideals with respect to extending the Pax Britannica tended to be directed at the upper classes, the colonial officers, while notions about mucking in and making do as Greater Britons self-evidently interpellated a wider audience. It is part of  Kipling’s power as Empire Laureate that, most successfully of  the jingo poets, his terms of  address glide smoothly between and across social levels, and are consequently the more prominently worlded both in reaching out to a diversified ‘England’, and in terms of  their potential influence. As Malvern van Wyk Smith shows in his study of  the poetry of  the Anglo-Boer War, the pages of  Cape and Boer republic papers of  the period were bestrewn with verse, not all of  it pro-British or pro-imperial, written in imitation of Kipling’s infectious, plain-speaking balladic stanza.36 In respect of  its second operation, as a form of  circulation, the circulating and globalized jingo poem could also work in a more obvious way as a channel for the transmission of  imperial meanings. The shift of  emphasis here is fairly subtle, in so far as the one form is predicated on the other; the widely circulat- ing jingo poem could, as a reifying structure, in itself  also become a conduit for circulation. In some cases, for example, imperial values were embedded within its form, such as in its capitalized abstracts, which features then came to act as circuits for these values, especially where, say, the style of  capitalization was copied by one poet’s work to another. Other formal features, such as the imper- ative mode, the ballad stanza, and other choric effects, widely repeated and rehearsed, were conventionalized as embodying certain British colonial values, for example moral endurance, no-nonsense robustness, masculine steadfastness. In a word, the jingo poem emolliated imperial and national values across the world, even as the genre itself  operated as an emollient form. The mobility of  ‘things’ and forms, including poems, and the enhanced openness of  the channels through which these things moved, which the jingo 35Henry Newbolt, ‘Vitaï Lampada’, in Empire Writing, ed. by Boehmer, pp. 287–88; Kipling, Definitive Edition, p. 321. 36Malvern van Wyk Smith, The Poetry of  the Anglo-Boer War, 1899–1902 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1978). </page> <page sequence="13"> 041-057_YES41_2_Boehmer_160 x 235mm  26/04/2011  20:37  Page 53 elleke boehmer 53 poem’s worldwide dissemination exemplifies, can now be pinpointed by looking at the operation and reception of  two iconic jingo poems of  high imperialism, both already cited. Newbolt’s ‘Vitaï Lampada’ (‘The Lamp of  Life’) and Kipling’s hymn-like ‘A Song of  the English’, a poem sequence celebrating the worldwide spread of  English ‘Sons of  the Blood’, can be read as exemplifying, respectively, a circulating imperial form, and a form of  imperial circulation (that itself  acknowledges the global dissemination of  English ‘forms’). ‘Vitaï Lampada’ (1897), the earliest written of  Henry Newbolt’s patriotic turn-of-the century poems, is based on an ethic fundamental to Britain’s imperial endeavours, namely, that war is like sport and, therefore, that war is the more successful the more it is played out as a game on a public-school playing field. Differently put, learning selflessness on the playing field produces honourable conduct in imperial battle. In the poem the beleaguered cricket scene, galvanized by the captain’s call to go on playing the game that is evoked in the first stanza, fades into the classic scene of  late nineteenth-century imperial warfare in the second, with the broken square in the desert reminiscent of  the fateful January 1885 battle to relieve Gordon. In the third and final stanza, the historically stirring poem gathers itself  to deliver once more the motto that by now is well established though clearly worth repeating. Life is a tireless relay in which the ethic of  playing the game against the odds is passed on like a torch from one generation to the next in order that, the assumption is, the people sustained by precisely that chivalric ethic may propagate themselves into the future. So familiar and emollient was its ethic to the poem’s audiences, and so  effective the poem in conveying it, that it was widely anthologized within years of its first being published and taken up as a school song by public schools across Britain. It remains the poem for which Newbolt is best known as a poet today, despite the fact that his reputation in the period was founded on his work as a Liberal balladeer of British maritime history. With its memorable four- square, double-quatrain, tightly rhyming abab stanzaic structure, ‘Vitaï Lampada’ was quickly loosened from its origins in Newbolt’s œuvre to become quite obviously a circulating form disseminating an object lesson in imperial circulation. This is nowhere more convincingly illustrated than in its adaptation under the more straightforward, or less pretentious, title ‘Play the Game!’ as a tableau- and-recitation exercise in ‘patriotism’ in Robert Baden-Powell’s first edition of Scouting for Boys (1908). As the dates suggest, this was a mere eleven years after the poem’s first publication. Convinced by the idea that boys never learn so well as when they are at play, Baden-Powell included the ‘Play the Game’ playlet in ‘Scouting Games, Practices and Displays’, the filler section to the final Part VI of  his Scouting primer, where it comes complete with stage directions unabashed </page> <page sequence="14"> 041-057_YES41_2_Boehmer_160 x 235mm  26/04/2011  20:37  Page 54 54 The Worlding of  the Jingo Poem as to their literal reading of  the poem.37 Before the last refrain-like direct-speech line at the end of  the second stanza, Baden-Powell inserts: [Action: The younger officer stands forward pointing his sword to the enemy, and the retreating soldiers turn ready to charge with him as he cries — ] ‘Play up! Play up! And play the game!’ It would be difficult to think of  a more explicit rendition than this of  the soon- to-be Chief  Scout’s belief  that, as in his own Matabele campaign, officers support their leaders to the hilt not for rewards but ‘because it is the game’.38 In the playlet, as in the poem, the ethic that ‘[war is] the only game worth playing’, to quote the Pall Mall Gazette at the start of  the Boer War, is so unquestioningly accepted that the pivot on which the poem turns, the shift from playing field to real-life battle, requires little to no special explanation, not even from Baden- Powell. As ‘Vitaï Lampada’ clearly shows, a circulating form of  empire, the jingo poem, could further corroborate its function by becoming a form of  circulation too; in this particular case, a channel for imperial morale. Rudyard Kipling first published his collection of  verses hymning the English- speaking colonies and their interconnection under the title ‘A Song of  the English’ in 1893, and then as The Seven Seas in 1896, with the inclusion of  ‘Hymn before Action’, in the lead-up to Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee.39 In the poem sequence, the five recognizably hymn-like stanzas of  ‘A Song of  the English’ introduce the ‘broken interludes’ of  the six further ‘songs’, which take the form of  rhyming couplets, the lines as long as or longer than the alexandrine, but with metrical digressions into balladic and other stanzaic forms: ‘The  Coastwise Lights’, ‘The Song of  the Dead’, ‘The Deep-Sea Cables’, ‘The Song of  the Sons’, ‘The Song of  the Cities’, and ‘England’s Answer’. In each one of the poems, even as the empire is successively represented as woven, ‘strawed’, threaded, seeded, linked, and knotted by, respectively, coast-light beams, English bones, under-sea cables, fraternal and family connections, harbour cities, and ‘The Blood’, the stern injunction throughout is for the British to rise to the God-given mission of  imperial expansion and strive to ‘be one’. From 1909, towards the end of  the high imperial Edwardian decade, the ‘Song of  the English’ poem sequence was printed separately in an expensive though popular velum format. This is further evidence, reinforcing that which emerges from the sequence as a formal structure, that, even as the poems intoned the importance of  imperial interconnection and solidarity, their physical manifestation, here in book form, handed down this lesson as well.40 37 Robert Baden-Powell, Scouting for Boys, ed. by Elleke Boehmer (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 336–37. 38MacDonald, Language of  Empire, pp. 66–67, 21 (emphasis original). 39 For the entire sequence see Kipling, Definitive Edition, pp. 170–78. 40MacDonald, Language of  Empire, p. 147. </page> <page sequence="15"> 041-057_YES41_2_Boehmer_160 x 235mm  26/04/2011  20:37  Page 55 elleke boehmer 55 In a longer essay, ‘A Song of  the English’ and its accompanying poems would invite an extended commentary on the ways in which the poems cast the empire as a natural birthright of  the English and yet also as a duty to which they should proudly rise. Throughout, ‘[serving] the Lord’ is equated with imperial service; and to ‘smite’ a ‘pathway to the ends of  all the Earth’ means ‘[Holding] the ‘Faith’. However, in respect of  this essay’s particular focus on the world circula- tion of  jingoist feelings and jingo forms, what is of  most immediate interest is the poem sequence’s repeated recognition of  the interpenetration of  the world, its seas, seabeds, cities, and frontiers, by the English and by English meanings. Formally, this interpenetration is underscored through the use of  the same or related poetic devices across the different constituent poems, not only in the adaptation of  the would-be grand alexandrine that recurs in all but ‘The Song of  the Cities’, but also in the high-flown biblical idiom, disseminated across the poems, and the anthropomorphism of  lights, bones, cables, and cities that is in each case voiced in the first-person. As ‘The Deep-Sea Cables’ has it, the world that is reflected in this poem is ‘joined’ by the ‘words of  [English] men’ that ‘flicker and flutter and beat’ across the ‘deserts of  the deep’. Although ‘A Song of  the English’ in its vellum covers may have played its part as a circulating imperial form, it is therefore most resonant for the purposes of my argument for the attention it pays to forms of  circulation, on two separate levels. First, there is its acknowledgement of  the many interwoven forms of circulation that make empire possible (cable networks, ‘[shuttling]’ steamships); and second, even more presciently, the sequence itself  can be seen to operate as a network of  circulating forms, threading different imperial registers (the hymn- like cadences, the first-person monologues) through the different poems. While Kipling allows the outer world to interpenetrate the sequence in the form of  its images of  networks and intercontinental conversation, these various poetic devices also interpenetrate the expanded and expanding British world such as the sequence represents it. Fredric Jameson in his influential essay ‘Modernism and Imperialism’ observes that, though the imperial metropolis was interpenetrated by colonial capital, empire itself, and the work of  empire, remained to literary writers almost  inconceivable, beyond representation, unless of  course they had travelled out to meet that blankness, as did Joseph Conrad.41 The high level of  aestheticization that is associated with modernism, he therefore proposes, emerged as a type of compensation for the ‘unrepresentable totality’ of  empire.42 As against 41 Fredric Jameson, ‘Modernism and Imperialism’, in Terry Eagleton, F. Jameson, and Edward W. Said, Nationalism, Colonialism and Literature (Minneapolis: University of  Minnesota Press, 1990), pp. 43–66. 42 Ibid., pp. 58–59. </page> <page sequence="16"> 041-057_YES41_2_Boehmer_160 x 235mm  26/04/2011  20:37  Page 56 56 The Worlding of  the Jingo Poem Jameson’s thesis, this essay submits that empire, the world interconnected by British nationalist ideologies and technologies, is fully present within, and present to, the jingo poem, though in rhetorical and technical more than in spatial terms. As rallying cry, as anthem to imperial power, as swelling, self-  glorifying chorus, the jingo poem in the time of  high imperialism emerged from the understanding that the British nation had become a global force; that its imperial values carried significance, in various registers, for peoples around the world. Finally, compelling evidence for the worldwide propulsion of  the jingo poem comes from an unexpected quarter, which can in part be explained by that slide between imperialist and nationalist values that the poem habitually  accomplishes. Across the twentieth century and beyond, it is curious to see, imperialist sentiments, devices, and phrases that had been trademarked for and by the late nineteenth-century jingo poem flowed without obstacle into both the public rhetoric and private structures of  feeling of  anti-colonial nationalist leaders. So Gandhi invoked Tennyson’s ‘do and die’ (for Gandhi, ‘Do or Die’) from ‘The Charge of  the Light Brigade’ as a motto for his Quit India campaign in 1942.43 And Nelson Mandela openly turned to lines of  seeming imperialist verse for moral support at times of  emotional stress. On 11 June 2010, the opening day of  the international World Cup tournament in South Africa, while himself  experiencing intense personal grief  at the loss of  a great-grand-daughter in a car accident the night before, Mandela in absentia urged audiences around the globe, and especially in South Africa, simply that ‘the game must start and we must enjoy the game’.44 His line bears unmistakable echoes of  Newbolt’s refrain, namely, to ‘Play the game’ against all odds. Earlier than this, on Robben Island, Mandela turned for comfort and inspi- ration to a work by the hysterically jingoist Scottish amputee poet W. E. Henley, author of  such poems as ‘The Choice of  the Will’ and ‘Pro Rege Nostro’, as laden as Kipling’s Songs with elevated abstract nouns like ‘Will’, ‘Law’, and ‘Word’ signifying the imperial mission.45 As dramatized in the 2010 film Invictus directed by Clint Eastwood, Mandela in extremis valued the bold (but not partic- ularly imperial) defiance of  lines from Henley such as ‘Under the bludgeonings of  chance | My head is bloody but unbowed’. ‘Invictus’, or undefeated, which was first published by Henley in 1875 as ‘I. M. R. T. Hamilton Bruce’, and later in his 1889 collection Echoes, probably acquired its Latinate title only once it entered colonial school anthol ogies, alongside poems like ‘Vitaï Lampada’.46 Yet 43 Robert J.
