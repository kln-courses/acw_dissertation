Sylvain da Costa Dassault Aviation Copyright © 1999 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT Avcorp Industries Inc. recognized the need to reduce assembly labor costs in order to stay competitive with global competition. After two years of research and investigation it was determined that a joint project with Dassault Aviation provided the most viable solution. The key elements of the technology developed by Das- sault were its high flexibility and rapid payback of capital investment. This paper describes the system and the application. The structure's design and robotic system design were performed in parallel. A number of design challenges had to be overcome. Many of these issues encountered were common to any automated assembly application. By covering these challenges Avcorp was able to intro- duce automated assembly at a level that had typically been previously attained exclusively by much larger enterprises. The robotic system consists of two anthropomorphic robots, which work both individually and in tandem. The operations performed include drilling, countersinking, sealant application, cieco insertion, as well as the instal- lation of blind fasteners, solid fasteners and hi-lites. This system is currently performing integration tests and will enter production in fourth quarter 1999. Development testing has substantiated our estimates concerning cost reduction and quality enhancement. 1 INTRODUCTION Avcorp Industries Inc., Aerostructures Division, a small to mid-size aircraft structures manufacturing company, faced an ongoing challenge to reduce its production costs in the mid 1 990's. Avcorp had a number of ongoing cost savings initiatives in its fabrication operations, but recognized the need for labor hours reduction in its assembly area. The search for the appropriate, cost jus- tifiable assembly automation was undertaken. Over an 18 month span, Avcorp dedicated one engineer to inves- tigating and collecting all relevant information bearing on the potential solution. Multiple company, facility and con- ference visits along with consulting help from local Uni- versity research departments were utilized. The keys to implementing assembly automation at Avcorp were iden- tified as; 1. Having a sponsored project, 2. Initiating con- current design for automation, 3. Providing flexibility of automation and tool design. These factors were all key to assuring a viable return on investment. 2 PROCESS OF SELECTION Avcorp collected all available data on assembly automa- tion implementations and research. The possible alter- natives were reviewed. The co-operative anthropo- morphic robot solution developed by Dassault Aviation was considered to best fit all of Avcorp's criteria. Prior to making a final decision, a combined process time, return on investment and reliability study was carried out in col- laboration with Dassault. Since assembly automation is a major investment as well as a technical challenge, an automation initiative must be fully understood and sup- ported. 3 KEYS TO SELECTION The following are the major reasons for going with Das- sault Aviation's design concept: • Flexibility of design. • Software capability. • Process cycle time. • Process quality. • Reliability. • Multifunction end effector design. • PHL interface with Catia solid model. • Standard Robots assure good product support. 720</page><page sequence="2">4 TECHNICAL SPECIFICS OF THE CELL The AVCORP Flexible Assembly Cell is a derivative of Dassault's previous ARMA cell. This is a fully coopera- tive robot cell developed for the assembly of complex structures. One of the major advantages of using two separate motion machines is the ability to assume two different attitudes on either side of the assembly. This provides access to difficult to reach areas inside wing boxes, or similar structures, without the danger of collid- ing with the structure. The following description is not intended to detail all the parts of the cell, but to explain what makes this cell unique, flexible and cost effective: • The mobility system, for achieving real flexibility in production • The programming system to provide accuracy in a numerically defined world • Cooperative operations to master the process. 4.1 THE MOBILITY SYSTEM, OR ACHIEVING REAL FLEXIBILITY IN PRODUCTION - The mobility system in the AVCORP Flexible Assembly Cell consists of a pair of movable robotic platforms. Each platform is fully autono- mous of the other, in order that each one is capable of working separately or in cooperation. A robotic platform consists of the following elements: The following main parts compose the Platform: 721</page><page sequence="3">A robot and its controller - In our case, an ABB 6400L has been selected. This choice has been made primarily on the size and payload of the robot. The final selection was also influenced by its maintainability. A supporting structure - This structure has been designed for the best ratio of weight vs. rigidity. It is com- patible with various brands of robots as well as different machine heights in order to cope with different tooling. In our case a height of 1800mm (74") was chosen. The movable devices - In order to achieve the desired mobility in the workshop, two devices were installed on the platform: 4 rotative wheels for long distance travel 4 aircushions for easy and accurate short distance dis- placement The combination of the two devices permits easy travel in the workshop, particularly in proximity to the parts being produced. The placement pads - Each platform needs stability and accurate placement to maintain work quality. This is pro- vided by a set of 6 pads attached to the floor. 1 pad is conical, 1 is a V shape, and the 4 others are flat. This assures the accurate placement of the platform in front of the part to assemble. This is the only facility modification required for the cell. End-effector rack - A double end-effector rack is present on the platform. It is capable of hosting up to 10 end- effectors. They can be exchanged from platform to plat- form depending on the production requirements. Process controller - The process controller is designed to drive any end-effector type present on the cell. It con- sists of an electrical cabinet which contains smart digital variators, and a PC operating under windows NT which host the process controller software. Cabling - The cabling is based on a readily available field bus: Interbus S. This decreases the number of cables required and helps in case of a change or hardware change. Fastener distribution - The fastener distribution consists of a dual column of cassettes designed by Dassault/ AHG. It can host 14 different fastener references (solids, Hi-lites, blinds). Cassette changes can be easily made during production. Each cassette is coded in order to assure its recognition by the supervisor. In the same manner, dual cassette position for clecos is provided with the cell. 722</page><page sequence="4">Miscellaneous A quick changer to exchange end-effectors. A safety device to detect any shock while working. A chip vacuuming device. A lubrication system. Safety - Two laser/scanners are installed on the platform. These scanners can be programmed to match the sur- rounding environment. They prevent any interference between the operator and the robot in automatic mode. The platform was designed to be completely autono- mous. When a platform moves from part to part, the only operations to be performed are: • Position the platform on the pads • Apply electrical and pneumatic power • Connect the network with the supervisor This autonomy gives the production manager the possi- bility of deciding whether he wants to configure a cooper- ative cell capable of installing rivets, for example, or two stand alone platforms performing drilling or blind riveting operations on two different parts. This capability is of extreme importance to a subcontrac- tor, since it is impossible to accurately forecast the assembly operations required for the next 10 to 15 years. The mobility system provides the assurance that what- ever the assembly requirements may be in the future, this system will be able to perform the operation anywhere in the workshop. 4.2 THE PROGRAMMING SYSTEM, OR BEING ACCURATE IN A NUMERICALLY DEFINED WORLD - The situation is the following: At any time, we may have a new part to assemble. This part may or may not be on a movable jig. Our tooling is known to have some built in inaccuracy. The part itself is produced with built in variation and its position is not exactly the same as defined in the CAD system; the robot is not as accurate as it could be, etc. The global pro- gramming (including resetting) has to take care of these tolerance build-up issues. The elements that allow us to solve all of the above problems consist of the following: 4.2.1 Simplified programming architecture CAD/CAM ^ PHL PEGASUS file editor ▼ Y Geometry -Ą Assembly file process Programming station Y _ " Current °f!Te assembly process Τ PEGASUS „ Vision Supervision Supervision offsets station ▲ Τ Process Controller Execution Kernel ^ ▲ τ τ τ Robot CN Filtering Etc function function Process controller Robot controller 4.2.2 Programming workflow Τ Geometry^ programming sjmu|atjon ▲ Y import module PEGASUS τ .

Production 723</page><page sequence="5">Geometry programming - This consists of the program- ming of the different working trajectories as well as the approach and escape trajectories in order to avoid any possible collisions. This will also provide for the general organization of the program (link definition). This is a module running inside the CAD/CAM system (CATIA) in this case. This geometry programming is coupled with a simulation package in order to visualize the result of the programming. PEGASUS editor - The geometry file and structure is then sent to PEGASUS editor (via PEGASUS import module) which will complete the geometric file with all processes and work program. (See PEGASUS SAE paper # Filtering - The anthropomorphic robots available on the market are repeatable but nor sufficiently accurate to assemble our parts without external support. This is not important when we are working with a single robot approach, (thanks to local resetting), but become essen- tial when two robots work are working in cooperation. In a dual robot approach, only one robot can be reset by vision due to accessibility limitations. Therefore, the "master" robot needs to send the resetting information to the "slave" robot. To do so, both robots need to have an accurate reference. In order to achieve a sufficient accuracy, both robots are subjected to a calibration phase using a calibration pack- age currently available on the market. The robots are checked in different positions, and an algorithm permits them to interpolate the other positions of the robot work- ing space. This check operation is performed only once. Accuracy better than 0.5 mm is obtained. The filtering phase is then to be applied to the theoretical geometric file before each new part program is per- formed. Global resetting - Before each is assembled, we need to link both robots as well as jig or part frame together. To achieve that, we employ a global resetting process based on a 3D vision system and end-effector. Three targets are located on each side of the jig. The position of these targets is accurately known. Each robot references itself to its three targets using the 3D vision. The three frames: "master" robot, "slave" robot and jig are then calculated in a common reference frame. Local resetting - The last operation is a vision operation on the part itself. It will ensure that the different opera- tions will be performed at the proper location. Therefore, the system takes a number of references on the part itself (tack rivets, locating holes, etc.). The differences are recorded in an offset file in PEGASUS. If the differences exceed a programmed value, a warning is issued for the operator in order for him to determine if there is a prob- lem in the positioning of the part. Later on, these offsets will be to the "master" robot and the "slave" robot. This permits the system to install the fasteners at the right location "as it is" and assures that the two robots are aligned. All these steps are necessary only when a new part is launched in production. Only the last two phases need to be performed at each assembly set. 4.3 COOPERATIVE PROCESSES OR MASTERING THE PROCESS 4.3.1 Hypothesis - The parts to be assembled require a number of fastener types • Solid rivets • Blind rivets • Hi-lites Clamping is required in order to avoid gaps between assembly parts. The thickness of the structure changes radically between tip and root. Accessibility is difficult due to possible interference with structural parts. Clecos are required due to demands of fay sealant. And the most important is that the conditions may evolve during the life cycle of the cell with the evolution of the parts def- inition, or simply with the addition of new parts. 4.3.2 Cell processes - In order to solve the problem, the cell was designed to: Drill only a single side Drill only 2 sides using cooperative processes (due to lack of rigidity on some areas) Install clecos on a single side Remove clecos on a single side Install blind rivets on a single side Install solid rivets on two sides with a cooperative pro- cess Install solid rivets on two sides with a man machine pro- cess (for very difficult accessibility situations) Install Hi-lites on two sides with a man machine process (for reasons of economy) 4.3.3 Multifunction end-effector - The necessity to per- form several elementary processes on the same point (drilling sealing, fastening for example) led to a multifunc- tion end-effector. This multifunction end-effector allows us to perform all of the required processes with its generic hardware, the specifics of each process being accomplished by exchanging internal modules. What- ever the operation, the movements are generated by the multifunction end-effector electrical motors. The one we selected has the following characteristics: • A programmable clamping nose ( 0-70kg) to take care of the many thicknesses of material. • Four modules for four different processes, drilling/countersinking, sealing, fastening. 724</page><page sequence="6">• The fourth module is available for an extra drilling/ countersinking • Programmable feed rate: 0 to 100 mm/sec (0 to 150 inch/sec) • Programmable rotation speed: 0 to 9000 RPM This reconfigurable end-effector permits us to switch from one type of fastener to the next in a few minutes, or even in a few seconds by switching between two different end- effectors. 4.3.4 Process controller - The process controller is the key to the process mastering. Based on a PC, it controls all the types of end-effectors as well as peripheral equip- ment. Scheme All the processes parameters are stored in the process controller, in order to achieve the required part quality. When the process is being performed, the value of key parameters may be checked and stored to guarantee the traceability of the process. More important, the process controller is responsible for all aspects of the processes, even in the case of coopera- tive processes. In order to keep the process simple to program for the user, but nevertheless powerful, it has been organized in three levels. • Elementary functions: They are written in C++. They normally do not need to be modified or created by the user. 2 examples: - Write_error_mess (#, string) - Rotate_spindle(Speed,errmess) The elementary functions are supplied with the cell • Cycles: They consist of an arrangement of elemen- tary functions with a structure. These structures in- clude notions of parallelism and cooperation. Ex: Cycle Airblast () Sequential Function Set_Output_IBS (Blow, on; Function Wait_End_Of_Delay(1 .5); Function Set_Output_IBS (Blow, Off); End End Cycles are supplied with the cell, but can also be modified or created by the user • Processes: These are an arrangement of cycles, ele- mentary functions, and other processes with a struc- ture. These structures include notions of parallelism and cooperation. They are basically handled by the user. Ex: Process Peck_Drill_5_2G Sequential Cycle Select Module (4) Parallel Cycle C_Clamp (Force= 1 50, Force2=400) Cycle First_Fast_Adv (Fast_Advan, Nose) End Parallel Cycle Chips_Collect Etc 5 DESIGN FOR AUTOMATION To complement the Robotics Assembly Cell, Avcorp's Engineering and Aerostructures Divisions established a "design for manufacture" (DFM) methodology for the pro- duction of the CRJ-700 Vertical and Horizontal Stabilizer assemblies. This involves the integration of the design for ease of automated manufacture and the development of critical support systems to facilitate the specific requirements of a robotic flexible assembly cell. TECHNICAL STUDY AND CELL DEFINITION - At the beginning of the CRJ-700 project in 1996, Avcorp estab- lished a robotics research team, composed of both design engineering and manufacturing representatives. Initially, this team performed a Technical Feasibility Study with Dassault CTRI, the robotics system developers. 725</page><page sequence="7">This joint study assessed the use of automated robotic assembly technology for final assembly of the CRJ-700 Vertical and Horizontal Stabilizers and determined the configuration, capabilities and functional requirements for a proposed cell in the categories of hardware, software, training, support structures and maintenance. This framework was documented in an Avcorp Functional Specification for the Robotics Assembly Cell. The study and specification defined the following configu- ration for the CRJ-700 stabilizer automated cell. The cell should consist of paired, coordinated anthropomorphic robots performing assembly tasks on a vertical jig type fixture. The robot platforms and/or the tooling/jigs would be mobile on wheels, tracks or air cushions. As it is not easy to move large assemblies to the automated equip- ment, it is sometimes more efficient to move the auto- matic cell to the part to be assembled. This solution avoids the costs associated with duplication of the auto- matic cell for multiple assemblies and improves the sys- tem's flexibility and efficiency as the same robotic equipment is able to work on 4 different assembly jigs. Technical Feasibility Study - Alternative Cell Concepts The study also defined the following potential process capabilities for the cell; drilling, countersinking, solid/ countersunk rivet insertion and installation, blind fastener installation, installation of hi-locks and lock bolts, sealant application, and/or automated inspection/SPC. For final assembly, an automated cell could perform drilling and fastener installation of the skins to stringer-rib-spar frame on a vertical jig fixture and the drilling/fastening of the skin to rib-spar frame for the elevator. On sub assem- blies, automated assembly could be used on the stabi- lizer spar to web interface for both the front and rear spars in the fabrication of the stabilizer leading edge assemblies and in the assembly of the stabilizer center- section. The current configuration of the CRJ-700 assembly cell reflects the preliminary configuration determined in the study. Two ABB 6400-3.0/75 6-axis anthropomorphic robots are utilized as the mobility machines. Each robot is capable of a three meter reach and has a maximum 75 kg end-of-arm payload capacity. The robots are mounted on self-contained, mobile air-cushion platforms that index to steel locator pads on the shop floor. There are two robot working positions for the Vertical Stabilizer and Ele- vators and six positions for the Horizontal Stabilizer. The Vertical Stabilizer assembly jig is also re-movable on air cushions from between the two Vertical Stabilizer robot positions. This allows for the exchange of the similarily sized Vertical and Elevator assembly jigs to and from this floor position. Avcorp Robotics Cell - 2 Robots on Platforms The Robotics Assembly Cell automates the final assem- bly drilling and installation of solid rivets, blind rivets and the installation of Hi-Lite bolts into the skin of the stabi- lizer and elevator structures. The system is capable of drilling, countersinking, installing solid rivets from 1/8" to 3/16" diameter, installing blind rivets from 1/8" to 3/16" diameter, inserting Hi-Lite bolts 3/16" diameter, applying under-head sealant to the fastener and installing/remov- ing "cieco" temporary fasteners. Modular, 4 barrel multi- function end effectors are used for drilling and riveting process operations as well as other dedicated end-effec- tors for vision resetting, internal rivet bucking and cieco installation/removal. A modular, cassette based fastener delivery system is used to feed solid rivets, blind rivets, Hi-Lite bolts and clecos. 726</page><page sequence="8">Avcorp Robotics Cell - Multi Function, Cieco and Internal End Effectors STRUCTURES AND BUILD METHODOLOGY - Three CRJ-700 structures were considered for automated assembly at Avcorp; the Horizontal Stabilizer, the Vertical Stabilizer and the Left and Right side Elevators. The Horizontal Stabilizer wing box structure consists of upper and lower sheet metal skins with chemical-milled pockets and integrally machined front and rear spars. There are 12 machined ribs running chord-wise between the spars, per side. As well, 12 extruded Z-stringers run along the length of the upper and lower skins in a span- wise direction. At their intersection points, each stringer is fixed to a rib with a bent sheet metal clip. There are no access door cutouts on the upper skin and 1 door cutout located between Ribs No. 2 and 5 on the lower skin. A sheet metal doubler/door land sits beneath the skin at this location. The Horizontal Stabilizer has an overall span of 338", a root chord of 1 03" and a root chord depth of 1 0.5". Solid rivets are used for fixing the upper surface skins of the stabilizer and blind rivets are used on the lower surface skin for close-out of the box. CRJ-700 Horizontal and Vertical Stabilizers at Avcorp Industries Inc. The torque box of the Vertical Stabilizer consists of left side and right side chemical-milled sheet metal skins and 3 machined spars; front, mid and rear. There are 8 machined forward ribs between the front and mid spar and 8 machined aft ribs between the mid and rear spars, running in the chord-wise direction. Along the length of the skins, 6 extruded Z-stringers run span-wise between front and mid spars and 6 extruded Z-stringers between mid and rear spars. Bent sheet metal clips fix stringers to the ribs at the intersection locations. There are 7 access door cutouts on the left side skin and 6 cutouts on the right side. As in the Hstab, sheet metal doublers/door lands sit beneath the skin at these locations. The Vertical Stabilizer had an span of 137.5", a root chord of 100" and a root chord depth of 17.5". The left side skin is fixed using solid rivets and the box is closed out with blind riv- ets on the right side skin. The left and right side CRJ-700 Elevator torque box structures consist of upper and lower skins, a machined front spar and a sheet metal rear spar. There are 7 machined ribs and 13 sheet metal ribs running chord- wise between the front and rear spars. A single extruded Z-stringer runs spanwise along each of the upper and lower skins, midway between the spars. As in Hstab and Vstab, bent clips attach the stringers to the ribs. There are inspection door cutouts on the lower skin and no cut- outs on the upper surface. The fastener pattern for the elevator is similar to the Horizontal Stabilizer with solid rivets on the upper skin and blind rivets on the lower skin. The stabilizer structures use conventional aluminium materials and manufacturing processes. 2024-T3 alumi- num is used for sheet metal skins and stringers and 7451-T3511 for machined spars and ribs. The assembly build sequence using the Robotic Assembly Cell will con- sist of the following manual and automated steps: 1. Spars, ribs and stringers are manually assembled using mechanical fasteners, prior to drilling and installation of the skins. 2. The blank skins for the blind rivet side are manually located onto the sub-structure frame. Undersize pilot holes are manually back-drilled from the supporting structure and the skins are attached using temporary tack rivets. 3. The Robotic Cell automatically drills and counter- sinks the holes in the blind side skin. Cieco tempo- rary fasteners are automatically installed to maintain 727</page><page sequence="9">skin position prior to automated drilling and removal of tack rivet positions. 4. The drilled blind side skins are manually removed from the structural frame. Blank skins for the solid rivet side are manually located and attached using pilot holes and tack rivets. 5. The Robotic cell automatically drills, countersinks and installs solid rivets on the solid side skins. Unlike the blind side, these skins are permanently drilled/riv- etted in one operation and cannot be removed. 6. Internal hydraulic, electrical and flight control compo- nents are manually installed in the structure. 7. Finally, the blind side skin is re-located and attached using cieco temporary fasteners. 8. The Robotic Cell automatically installs blind rivets to close the wing box structure. CATIA DESIGN - For the CRJ-700 Vertical and Horizon- tal Stabilizer design, Avcorp upgraded its Computer Aided Design and Engineering capabilities through the adoption of CATIA CAD/CAM software. CATIA was a common interface for data transfer between Avcorp and Bombardier, Canadair, the customer for the CRJ-700 sta- bilizer structures. Internally, the software also provided a direct communication link between the Engineering, Manufacturing and Tooling Groups. With respect to the Robotics Assembly Cell, CATIA was used in the following manner. All structural and systems parts for CRJ-700 Vertical and Horizontal Stabilizers were designed in CATIA by Avcorp's Engineering Group. The coordinate locations for the skin to structure fasteners was defined directly in the CATIA design datasets of the assembly models. As well, the assembly tooling, the ABB robots, the end-effectors and the robot base platforms were also modeled in CATIA. Avcorp Robotics Cell - CATIA Models of Robot Platform, End Effector and Horizontal Stabilizer Cell From the Engineering Design datasets, CATIA master models defining the fastener coordinates were created. Fastener XYZ coordinates were defined by a point gener- ated on the OML surface of the skin. The fastener orien- tation was defined using a normal line projected through this coordinate point and the skin OML surface. The fas- tener reference, a unique code identifying the fastener type, diameter and nominal grip length, was associated to the fastener coordinate point using the CATIA ATTRIBUTE function. Off-line programming of fastener geometry was per- formed in CATIA using PHL, a CATIA Gil function devel- oped by Dassault CTRL CATIA SESSIONS for PHL programming (incorporating Stabilizer structures, robots, end effectors and assembly tooling) were created at each robot working position. PHL programming involved selecting and grouping individual fastener points into LINKS, along structural elements such as ribs, stringers and spars. PHL requires the part's OML skin surfaces and fastener point locations to define robot paths and LINK locations. LINKS were created for process WORK points and APPROACH and ESCAPE paths for both external and internal robots. Simulations for robot path accessibility and collision detection was performed to ver- ify end-effector, tool and part clearances, using standard CATIA ROBUSE, TASK and WORKCELL functions. The Robotic Geometric dataset was then exported into PEGASUS Editor, a UNIX based off-line programming database developed by Dassault CTRI, for the off-line programming of Processes and sequence-of-operations to each operation point. For the Robotics Project, CATIA provided the essential fastener geometry data to perform off-line programming and drive the Cell. Without CAD data, the programming of fastener locations would require tedious and lengthy manual teaching of each geometric point. As well, CATIA allowed development of virtual electronic mock- ups of the Vertical and Horizontal stabilizer to assess accessibility and maintainability issues concurrently with the stabilizer design. OTHER DESIGN AND AUTOMATION ISSUES - Auto- mation "ground rules" dealing with fundamental design methodologies such as parts integration and fastener standardization were established at the beginning of the CRJ-700 stabilizer design and manufacture at Avcorp. One major design engineering issue involved the integra- tion of traditional sub-assembled sheet metal assemblies 728</page><page sequence="10">to monolithic machined parts. Increasing the use of sin- gle piece CNC machinings decreased parts counts and the number of structural components decreased from 729 for the CRJ-200 Horizontal Stabilizer to 657 for the CRJ-700, despite a 70% increase in stabilizer size. This process also eliminated separate spar and rib sub- assembly requirements. Over 50% of the CRJ-700 Verti- cal and Horizontal Stabilizer structures consists of inte- gral machined structure including single piece ribs, stringers, fittings and spar structures. In the Horizontal Stabilizer, weight considerations resulted in the design of thin-walled integral machined rib structures equivalent to sheet metal ribs with .035" web and .050" flange thick- nesses. The integration of details improved the assembly process by reducing the number/complexity of parts in sub/final assemblies. The extensive use of CNC machin- ing produced parts of superior accuracy with fewer fit and contour problems on assembly. Machined parts provided a stiffer base than "built-up" sheet metal sub-structures, to support clamping operations during robotic drilling and riveting. CRJ-700 Integral M/C Rib and CRJ-200 Sheet Metal Rib Assembly A second major design consideration for robotic assem- bly was the reduction of fastener configuration variations. For the CRJ-700, approximately 3000 fasteners secure the skin to structure on the Vertical Stabilizer and 9000 fasteners on the Horizontal. The fasteners consist of solid and blind rivets and Hi-Lite and blind interference fit bolts in 3/16, 5/32 and 1/8" nominal diameters. The fol- lowing table lists the skin fasteners and their quantities breakdown: Fastener Class CRJ-700 Vertical Stabilizer CRJ-700 Horizontal Stabilizer B020501 9AD6 (3/1 6" dia) Solid Rivet - Csk 855 398 B020501 9AD5 (5/32" dia) Solid Rivet - Csk - 2782 B0205019AD4 (1/8" dia) Solid Rivet - Csk - 1088 NAS9302E6 (3/16" dia) Blind Rivet - Csk 827 142 NAS9302E5 (5/32" dia) Blind Rivet - Csk - 2100 NAS9302E4 (1/8" dia) Blind Rivet - Csk - 1094 HST11AG6 (3/16" dia) Hi Lite - Csk 872 63Õ PLT114-6 (3/16" dia) Blind Bolt - Csk 195 32Õ Others 229 484 Total 2978 9Õ38 Standardizing and reducing the numbers of fastener types and diameters simplified the automated tooling and equipment for loading, delivery and fastener installation. Additional simplification of fastener delivery and installa- tion was accomplished by rationalizing automation use to fasteners with sufficient quantities. For example, initial engineering designs used both 3/16" and 5/32" diameter solid and blind rivets in the Vertical Stabilizer skin. As well, 3/16" diameter interference fit Hi-Lite bolts were to be used in limited numbers (less than 1 0% of total fas- tener counts) and were not considered economically jus- tifiable for automated installation. However, during detailed design, engineering load changes in the spar also modified to eliminate all structures increased the numbers of 3/16" Hi-Lite fasteners used in both spar and rib-skin locations by 50%. This caused the introduction of a new class of fasteners for Robotic Installation. To off- set this increased complexity, the design was re-exam- ined and simplified by eliminating the use of 5/32" diameter solid and blind rivets and replacing them with 3/ 16" diameter rivets of the same classes. Similarly, small changes during the design period have resulted in significant modifications to the Robotic Assembly Cell. During the 2 year "joint definition" and "detailed design" phases of the stabilizer design, numer- 729</page><page sequence="11">ous "trade-off" studies of conflicting design versus auto- mation requirements were performed. One issue encountered during cell development involved the local vision resetting methodology used to compensate and re- align the cell to the as-built parts. Originally, local vision resetting was to be accomplished using a "2 points" align- ment methodology. Here, a linear fastener pattern or LINK was adjusted to the correct as-built location by off- setting its location between two pilot hole locations located at the ends of the LINK pattern. The interior pat- tern points were assumed to have constant pitch between them and were 1-dimensionally re-scaled using as-measured and nominal distances between the 2 refer- ence points. During the design period, it was found that many of the fastener patterns consisted of short rows of less than 5 fasteners or rows with non-uniform pitches. With this fastener pattern configuration, the "2 points" methodology would require excessive numbers of pilot hole locations for short patterns and would not be usable for rows with non-constant pitch. Subsequently, a "3 points" resetting methodology, applicable to multiple LINK patterns within the 3 alignment points and scalable in 2- dimensions was developed. As well, changes in rib-stiffener design configurations caused significant modifications to the physical dimen- sions of the internal end effector offset clamping foot and bucking bar tools. Here, engineering load changes increased the required clearance offset from 0.580" to 0.850" and reduced the available clearance from 1.218" to 1.131", between the outer flanges and integral chord- wise stiffeners in the machined ribs of the Vertical Stabi- lizer. Currently, 3 clamping foot/bucking bar configura- tions have been developed for use in the accessibility constrained locations of the Vertical and Horizontal Stabi- lizers. Use of the Robotics Assembly Cell was also considered during the design of the CRJ-700 assembly tooling. Analysis and verification of robot envelope, tooling acces- sibility and platform placement was concurrently per- formed with the stabilizer design using preliminary CATIA models of the stabilizer structures, assembly tools and robot/platform configurations. For example, the height of the robot envelope was optimized for the tallest structure to be automatically assembled - the CRJ-700 Horizontal Stabilizer. This requirement for vertical reach on the Hstab resulted in a platform design with the robot base elevated to 1800 mm above floor level. However, for the system to retain the flexibility to assemble the Vertical stabilizer and Elevators, their "picture frame" assembly jigs must also be designed to locate the structures within the defined robot envelope. As a result, the Vstab and Elevator locations within the jigs were checked and sub- sequently raised during the tool design. As well, the number and size of jig details positioned directly in front of the skins was minimized or made removable to main- tain good access for the robot end-effectors. Avcorp Robotics Cell -CRJ-700 Vertical and Horizontal Stabilizer Robot Work Envelopes 6 RETURN ON INVESTMENT Based on its implementation taking part at the startup of a new program projected to exceed 400 aircraft shipsets, the return on investment was easily justifiable. The assembly time savings per shipset for a vertical and hori- zontal stabilizer is projected in the range of 30%. Avcorp was also looking ahead in its decision making process to ensure the technology and research invest- ment was adaptable to other foreseen automation appli- cations. Currently Avcorp has undertaken to create a simulation model of the cell for improved process refine- ment and reduced implementation cycle time. The next step is to enable offline programming of the Robotic cell with complete equipment, part and process real time sim- ulation. This will greatly enhance the adaptability of this cell to other assemblies. It will also provide a platform for real time modeling of a cell design project prior to actual commencement of any equipment or tooling manufac- ture. This total package will enhance any future project return on investment. 730</page></plain_text>
