Montague's second edition of rebuttals to the zoo- morphic writings of such as Lorenz, Morris, and Ardrey, adds eight new authors to the original collec- tion. The new material augments the weight and prestige of the collection but doesn't change its essential character. The volume still contains many sound arguments why the zoomorphic fad is silly and possibly pernicious; but it still fails to propose an anthropomorphic vision of man. What we need is a book which makes a colorful and coherent case for the essential flexibility of human nature. NICHOLAS S. THOMPSON Psychology, Clark University</page></plain_text>
