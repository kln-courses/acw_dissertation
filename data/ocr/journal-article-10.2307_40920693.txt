<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Extreme Emotional Life of Vçdundr the Elf Ármann Jakobsson University of Iceland have been a fixture in the European mentality for a long time in fairytales and legends and, recently, in the most popular novels and films of our age. In this article, my aim is to deter- mine the function of elves in Old Norse narratives from the thirteenth century by concentrating on the figure of Vçlundr, the protagonist of VçlundarkviÒa, who to my mind is the most important Old Norse elf. The poem portrays his marriage to a southern swan-maiden who later leaves him. He then retires into solitude, hunting bears, and count- ing his rings until he is captured and enslaved by the avaricious King Níõuõr. The poem ends with Vçlundr's gruesome revenge on the king and his family. VçlundarkviÒa is the tenth of twenty-nine poems in the Codex Regius ms of the Poetic Edda. Few Eddie poems have suffered less from scholarly neglect: a recent bibliography lists over ioo studies, not counting editions (von See, et al. 77-81). There are grounds for this attention. To take one, VçlundarkviÒa is usually classified as a heroic rather than mythological poem and shares common characteristics with some of the more ancient heroic poems in the Elder Edda, and yet it stands among the mythological Eddie poems in the manuscript between PrymskviÖa and Alvtssmdl. Another distinguishing feature of VglundarkviÖa is its age. Most scholars believe that it is one of the oldest Eddie poems. l Furthermore, the poem has interesting connections with 1. Among those who have accepted V. as very old are Finnur Jónsson (Den oldnorske 212); Hamel; Jón Helgason (49) ; and Einar Ó1. Sveinsson (íslenzkarbókmenntir 229 and 416-23). Neckel was skeptical (279). Bugge ("Kvader") argued that V was composed in Norway around 900 by a Norwegian poet using English sources. Dronke suggests a long period</page><page sequence="2">228 Scandinavian Studies non-Nordic Germanic heroic poetry, English place-names, English and Gothic artifacts from the Viking age or even earlier, as well as Greek mythology (Dronke, The Poetic Edda il 258-90; Jón Helgason 27-52; von See, et al. 82-9 and 93-105; McKinnell 1-13). It is not surprising that considerable scholarly attention has been given to the historical background of the poem, and much effort has gone into attempting to distinguish young material from old and discerning later additions to the basic story (Dronke, The Poetic Edda 11 258-90; Jón Helgason 42-52; von See, et al. 82-106; Burson; Motz, "New Thoughts55). But while these matters are interesting and important, it might be fruitful to disregard for the moment the origins of individual motifs and narrative elements in order to focus instead on their function in Vçlundarkviõa in its present form.2 of composition, the final product stemming fram the tenth century (The Poetic Edda 11 269-90). McKinnell believes V to be composed in Yorkshire in the tenth or the early elev- enth century. Ásgeir BI. Magnusson has hinted that a later dating (and Icelandic origins) is possible. See (116-7) also seems to lean toward the twelfth century. Although the idea of the antiquity of V. has support from references in skaldic poetry and textual analogues with the tenth century English poem, Deor's Lament, V. in its present form exists only in the Codex Regius ms from the late thirteenth century (see e.g. Dronke, The Poetic Edda 11 271-8; von See, et al. 95-6 and 114-7). It is impossible to ascertain whether this is the original version of the poem, or if lines, stanzas, or whole sections have been altered or inserted. The present version of the poem may date from the thirteenth century; it may be older. It has to be read without that certainty. 2. The structure of V is somewhat complex, but most recent scholars have neverthe- less tried to interpret the poem as it stands (see e.g. Taylor, "The Structure"; Burson; Grimstad; Motz, "New Thoughts"; McKinnell; Dronke, The Poetic Edda n 255-300). It appears at first sight to be a fusion of two plots: the first concerns three swan-maidens who marry and leave three brothers. The second is a tale of the revenge of an elf smith unjustly captured by an avaricious king. The two may have been originally different nar- ratives but are conjoined in the present poem. Among scholars who believe in the linkage of two or more stories are: Boer; Neckel (283-92); Holmström; Vogt; Hamel (151-2); Bouman ("On VçlundarkviÔa"); Einar Ó1. Sveinsson (íslenzkar bókmenntir 417-20); and Burson (1). Some, e.g. Taylor ("The Structure" 229-34) and Burson (5-6), nevertheless argue that the two halves fit together in various ways, Taylor focusing on textual paral- lels, Burson on motifs and characters. See also Bouman, "Vçlundr as an Aviator." Motz ("New Thoughts" 62) thinks that the legend originally contained both halves (see also Niedner). Bonsack also believes that the legends were entwined in tradition. His idea of a relationship between the Friedrich von Schwaben and V leads him to reconstruct a twin narrative composed by the Heliand poet. Based on scant evidence (often using anagrams when he needs to establish a relationship), he then uses his reconstructed lost works to shed light on the extant texts.</page><page sequence="3">VÇLUNDR THE ELF 229 In spite of the abundance of studies on the poem, the character of Vçlundr remains elusive, and this study will explore his identity. One of the interesting facets of VçlundarkviÕa is that its protagonist is referred to as the "prince of elves." It is uncertain what that means and how his portrayal is important to the study of medieval elves. I will argue here that for a better understanding of elves, it is crucial to examine the nature ofVçlundr's Otherness and to elucidate VçlundarkviOvfs portrayal of the complex relationship between love, treachery, and revenge and its significance for the nature of medieval elves. The Elusiveness of Old Norse Elves Three times in Vqlundarkviòa, Vçlundr is referred to as an dlfr In stanza io, he is called "alfa lioJ3Ì," while in stanzas 13 and 32, he is called "visi alfa" by his enemy, King Níõuõr.3 The word ijóÔi seems to mean literally "of a [certain] people" (see ON lyÕr)^ while visi means "leader, king." Both are poetic words, but while visi is not uncommon, IjóÔi is not attested to in any other source.4 It thus seems evident that Vçlundr is an dlfr, but while his royal status does not seem important since none of his subjects makes an appearance in the poem. It must be noted that Vçlundr's elvish nature is problematic.5 While Vçlundr appears in several other Germanic sources, his elvish origins are hardly 3. 1 refer here and elsewhere in this article to Bugge's 1867 edition (165 and 169). When translating K, I use Dronke (The Poetic Edda 11243-54), unless otherwise stated. 4. Sveinbjörn Egilsson, Lexicon poeticum 379, 626. Sophus Bugge believed that ijóÔi must mean "leader" as well and suggested it was perhaps a loan-word from Old English (where léod means "leader") ("Kvadet" 52-3; see also McKinnell 3). The abundance of archaic words and hapax legomenon in V is one of the reasons scholars agree on the poem's antiquity. See Gering and Sijmons 1-26; von See, et al. 118-266. 5. Not all scholars agree that V is an elf. To Motz, he is a dökkdlfr, which means a dwarf or a supernatural smith. She is perhaps the most detailed theorist of V?s origins and her conclusion is that V. is originally a legendary craftsman of supernatural origin. While she stresses his supernatural status, she nonetheless believes his elvishness to be secondary ("Of Elves and Dwarfs"; The Wise One 131-37; "New Thoughts"). Grimstad concurs that as an elf, V. is the type resembling dwarfs. Dronke (The Poetic Edda 11 261-3) believes that the poem related to an old tradition in which alfar were subtle smiths before the dwarfs outshone the alfar in that respect. Taylor wavers between regarding PC as a god, a hero, a dark elf (dwarf), or even a giant ("Vôïundarkvida, PrymskviÒa" 268-9). He says: "Shifting as he does from one realm of being to another, he resists easy classification as either god or hero" (269).</page><page sequence="4">23O Scandinavian Studies anywhere mentioned outside VglundarkviÖa.6 However, if Vçlundr's suggested elvish character were not important in this particular version of his story, it is unlikely that it would be mentioned three times in a poem of only 41 stanzas.7 The position of VçlundarkviÕa between the mythological and heroic poems, along with Prymskviõa 2LnàAlvíssmál, might also be significant to the question of his identity, as it may reflect a conscious effort by the editor or editors of the Codex Regius to make the giants, elves, and dwarfs intermediaries between the gods and the mythical heroes.8 In the prose introduction to the poem in the Codex Regius, Vçlundr and his brothers are said to be "synir Finnakonvngs" [sons of the king of the Lapps] who married valkyries. Vçlundr is said to be "hagastr maJ3r sva at menn viti i fornom s^gom" (163) [the most skilful man known to men in the histories of the past]. Thus in the only source for Vçlundr the dlfi; there is some confusion about his nature. Whereas it is possible that the author of the prose introduction had reasons unknown to us for assuming that Vçlundr was a Sámi hunter and prince, it should also be kept in mind that the prose introduction is often regarded as an interpretation rather than an integral part of the poem (see Gunnell 194-203) and that in the poem itself, only alfar are mentioned.9 In this study, I will try to distinguish between mythological alfar and those of later folktales and literature. This is not to say that later material from folktales cannot have comparative value. Neither is J.R.R. Tolkien's interpretation as reflected in his fiction without interest, as he was a learned as well as an imaginative scholar. But however attractive, the time has come to resist reviewing information about alfar en masse and trying to impose generalizations on a tradition of a thousand years. Legends of alfar may have been constantly changing and were perhaps always heterogeneous so it might be argued that any particular source 6. The only exception is Layamon's Brut (Brook and Leslie 550-1), see McKinnell 3; Taylor, "VölundarkviOa, PrymskviÖa" 269. See also Grimstad 193-4. 7. There is some disagreement among scholars on how to define the stanzas of V: some editions making them forty in all (e.g. Jon Helgason) but some forty-one (e.g. Bugge; Dronke, The Poetic Edda 11). 8. See e.g. Burson 1; Vesteinn Olason 130; See et al. 105-6; Berg 255. Grimstad (193) suggests that V. forms together withAlnssmdl a duet of poems in the codex, about elves and dwarfs. 9. Some scholars have believed the connection with Sami to be ancient (üugge, Kvaaet ; McKinnell 9-10. See also Dronke, The Poetic Edda 11 287-9). It must also be noted that the distinction between Sámi and elves may be only on the surface (see Lindow, "Supernatural Others").</page><page sequence="5">Vqlundr the Elf 231 will only reflect the state of affairs at one given time. In addition, there must always have been variation in the way people regarded alfar. Bear- ing that fact in mind, I will focus on Old Norse sources, mainly from the thirteenth century. They may represent a much older tradition, but that conjecture is hard to prove. I will attempt here to distinguish Eddie infomation from other medieval sources, such as sagas and romances. In the more realistic Sagas of Icelanders, Bishops' Sagas, and Sturlunga saga, alfar are rare. When seen, they are distant, as in this example from Sturlunga, dated to 1168: "Sá vetr var kallaõr kynjavetr, 'n' at ')í urõu margir undarligir hlutir. M váru sénar sólir tvaer senn. Ok J)á váru sénir alfar ok aõrir kynjamenn ríõa saman í flokki í Skagafirõi,- sá Ari Bjarnarson" (123) ["This was called the Winter of Marvels because so many strange things occured: two suns were seen together in the sky; a troop of elves and strange beings were seen riding in Skagafjorõ by Ari Bjarnarson" (McGrew 101)]. The style of this passage indicates that it derives from an annalistic source. We learn precious little from it on the subject of alfar apart from their being on horseback in the company of other strange beings.10 There are also references to a cult of elves in the sagas but often in terms so vague that it is hard to arrive at any deep understanding of old rituals. In Kormdks saga, a witch (spdkona) wants to offer meat to alfar who seem to live in hills (Einar Ol. Sveinsson 288). n 'nEyrbyggjasaga, we find the familiar idea that people are expected to relieve themselves at a safe distance from a sacred spot, and the word used (dlfrek) indicates that the alfar might be expected to get angry although their relationship with the hallowed ground is not elaborated on (10, 15-6; see also Jakob Benediktsson 125). According to sparse examples in the King's Sagas, a cult of alfar 'was also believed to have existed in Norway before Christianity.12 In one case, a human king, Óláfr Geirstaõaálfr, seems to have been venerated as an dlfr after his death (Unger, Flateyjarbok 11 7).13 10. This may suggest that they were believed to keep livestock, as they do in more recent folktales (Einar Ol. Sveinsson, Um íslenzkar pjoÖsößur 158). 11. The episode is strange, and the witch I&gt;órdís may well be a comic figure, which might make her belief in alfar spurious, although the saga does seem to contain some older material. 12. The word "álfablót" is mentioned in Heimskringla (Óláfs saga helga). This feast takes place in Scandinavia but there is no information on what actually transpires (Bjarni Aõalbjarnarson, Heimskringla 11 137). See also Vries, "Über." 13. The epithet for Óláfr is also given in Heimskrinßla but his cult not elaborated upon (Bjarni Aõalbjarnarson, Heimskrinßla 1 79-84).</page><page sequence="6">232 Scandinavian Studies Alfar appear as characters in legendary sagas while in the foreign romances and the indigenous riddarasggur, dwarfs are more promi- nent.14 InNorna-Gestspdttr, alfar are synonymous with evil spirits and creatures of the Other World (Unger, Flateyjarbok i 346). In Bósa saga, alfar are listed with other evil spirits in the curse of the hag Busla (14). 15 In PiÕreks saga, a male dlfr has sexual relations with a woman. This dlfr is described as a strange spirit or incubus, who makes prophecies and seems to be able to vanish at will (319-22). Sexual relations between dlfar and humans also feature in Hrdlfs saga kraka where the human King Helgi rapes an elf woman and then takes no heed of her advice. The result is a half-elvish daughter, Skuld, whose nature is evil and who in the end marks the doom of the noble heathen King Hrólfr (see Ármann Jakobsson, "Queens of Terror"). In romances from Christian times, dlfar are on the whole evil rather than good. They seem to belong to a heathen past that Christianity is slowly uprooting, and that accounts for their nebulous image. But although these dlfar play a narrative role, their character is not firmly established. While they are obviously dangerous, the extent and nature of their wickedness is a matter of debate. The elvish nature of Queen Skuld is used to explain her villainous sorcery (no), but the saga also portrays her as the result of a human raping an dlfr and then neglecting to fetch his child at the appointed time. Human wickedness is thus the root of the evil inHrólfs saga; the dlfr only curses King Helgi as a reaction to his wrongdoing against her. This is also how the dlfar in post-medieval folktales often behave. Not evil in themselves, when wronged by humans, they carry out harsh acts of revenge. Although some romances might date from the thirteenth century, most are believed to be younger, and they often cannot be dated with certainty. Some are completely fictional, while others are reworkings of traditional matter within the restrictions of a genre that is essentially Christian. While they provide a medieval view of the dlfar, it may not be indigenous and perhaps not traditional. The Eddie material, on the 14. Motz lists some examples from romances in her pioneering article on dlfar in Old Norse texts ("Of Elves and Dwarfs" 96-8). See also Einar Ó1. Sveinsson, Um íslenzkar bioÖsöaur 151-8. 15. There is a similar curse in Grettissaga (204), where alfar are listed along with "^ursar" and "hamarsbuar."</page><page sequence="7">VÇIAJNDR THE ELF 233 other hand, has been largely collected rather than subjected to a new ideology and form, and the Prose Edda clearly stems from a genuine interest in a heathen past and is not just using alfar freely as a motif. This conclusion, though, does not necessarily mean that either the Poetic or the Prose Edda reflects genuine heathen tradition. However, these works purport to be traditional and can at least safely be dated to the thirteenth century and are thus clearly relevant to Vçlundr.16 In his Prose Edda from the first half of the thirteenth century, Snorri Sturluson discusses the alfar in chapter 17. According to him, there are two kinds of alfar, light and dark. The light alfar are bright and more beautiful than the sun. They live in a place which Snorri calls Álfheimar. The dark alfar live under ground and are "vlikir synvm ok myklv vlikari reyndvm" (Finnur Jónsson, Edda 25) ["unlike them in appearance, and even more unlike them in nature" (Faulkes 19)]. As scholars have remarked, the dark alfar seem to have little in common with the light alfar and may have more similarities with dwarfs, with whom they are occasionally confused in the Prose Edda. 17 Snorri is a well-known systematizer (see e.g. Frank) and might in this case be trying to make sense of a ambivalent tradition, where alfar can be either helpful and bright or dangerous and vengeful. To Snorri, this may have seemed contradictory although, as noted above, a similar duality in the elvish character is well-known from later folktales. In the Poetic Edda, the only álfr who appears is Vçlundr, but the phrase "^Esir ok alfar" (dat. plur. "ásum ok alfiim, " gen. plur. uása ok alfa") appears frequently, and in some instances, Vanir or even men are mentioned along with the^Esir and the alfar. 18 From this usage it is no great leap to deduce that the word álfr might sometimes not indicate a separate group with its own definitive features, but rather a different 16. I do not try to discuss the word dlfr in skaldic kennings since it adds little to what scant information we have. There is, however, an useful discussion in a recent disserta- tion by Alaric Hall. 17. E.g. in Skdldskaparmdl, chapter 35, where Ivalda synir are referred to as both dwarfs and dark elves (Finnur Jónsson, Edda 122). See also Motz, "Of Elves and Dwarfs"; Motz, The Wise One 87-130. 18. The poems in question are Vçluspd (Regius 50; Hauksbók 41), Hdvamdl (st. 143, 159, and 160), Grimnismdl (st. 4), Sktrnismdl (st. 7, 17, and 18), Lokasenna (st. 2, 13, and 30), PrymskviÒa (st. 7), as well as Sigrdrifumdl (st. 18). See Bugge 17, 23, 61, 63, 77^ 91, 93, 114-5, 118, 124-5, and 231. See also Finnur Jónsson 86; Ruggerini.</page><page sequence="8">234 Scandinavian Studies and perhaps lower form of deity, which might fit with the veneration of Oláfr Geirstaõaálfr.19 Lotte Motz ("Of Elves and Dwarfs" 95-6) has argued that the fact that the alfar are so often mentioned along with the ^Esir indicates a closeness, but the examples yield nothing definitive about alfar. There is a possibility that they are synonymous with the Vanir, as it might seem natural to speak of the ^Esir and the Vanir together when referring to the gods as a whole.20 In the poem Gnmnismdl (stanza 5), Freyr is said to have been presented with Álf- heimr at birth (Bugge 77).21 This tentative link with the Vanir might support the notion that a possible cult of the alfar had links to fertility. However, in at least three Eddie poems (Sktrnismdl, Sigurdnfumdl, and Alvtssmdl)^ the alfar are clearly separate from the Vanir (see note 20). If we balance the evidence, medieval sources yield no direct statement about the alfar being Vanir and some texts firmly indicate that they are separate groups. It is possible that alfar and Vanir are different generic terms and that a single being might be both an dlfr and one of the Vanir, but both Vanir and dlfar seem clearly separable from the ^Esir. The coupling of the dlfar with the y£sir in the phrase c^Esir ok alfar" seems essentially formulaic, since its most obvious function in these poems is to create assonance. Its use usually reveals little about dlfar apart from Loki's dubious assertion in Lokasenna that the god- dess Freyja has bedded every god and elf present at a particular party (Bugge 118), a rare mixture of elves and sex in Eddie texts. There are other brief and unsatisfactory glimpses of dlfar in Eddie poetry. In Fdfiiismdl (13), a dying dragon informs Sigurõr Fáfnisbani that some norns are of elvish descent while others are descended from theiEsir and some from dwarfs (Bugge 221). In Vajprúõnismdl (47) and Skirnismdl (4), the sun is called "alfrarõvll" which suggests a possible role for dlfar in its making (Bugge 72 and 91). Furthermore, the last 19. At the end of chapter 17 oí The Prose Edda, however, Snorri suggests that only light elves live in the third heaven of Víõbláinn where the sacred place Gimlé is located. That localization raises the question whether the dlfar might have been considered even nobler than the gods themselves. 20. Then the expression would mean all the gods, or designate a difference in status between the major fertility gods, the Vanir, and the minor, the dlfar. Terry Gunnell suggested a possible link between the Vanir and the dlfar in a (yet unpublished) paper presented in Reykjavik 14 September 2002. It is also discussed by Hall (34 and 44). See also Jón Hnefill Aõalsteinsson, PjóÔtrú og fcjóÕfheÒi 114-5. 21. Snorri uses Alfheimr as the name of the place where the alfar dwell (Finnur Jons- son 25).</page><page sequence="9">VÇLTJNDR THE ELF 235 poem of Codex Regius, Hamdismdl, opens with the enigmatic phrase "grçti alfa / in glystarmu" (Bugge 316) ["the source of elves' tears / dry of joy" (Dronke, The Poetic Edda 1 161)]. While its meaning is far from clear, this evocative image of sad and weeping alfar seems appropriate at the beginning of this very tragic poem. In Hdvamdl (st. 143), it is stated that Óõinn is called Dáinn with the dlfar but Dvalinn with the dwarfs (Bugge 61). While Ooinn's dwarfish name may allude to his secretive and deceitful nature, his elvish name means "dead."22 A group of scholars in the early twentieth century argued that the dlfar were a force of fruitlessness or death in Old Norse religion or even spirits of the dead (see Unwerth 29-32; Vries, Altgermanische Rdigionsgeschichte 1 257-60; Ellis 111-9. See also Motz, "Of Elves and Dwarfs" 100). Apart from this single name, there is little evidence from the Poetic Edda to support this idea although this theory may have implications for Vçlundarkvioa. On the other hand, the notion that dlfar (and other groups) have a separate name for various important things is the main theme of the poem Alvissmdl, which contains eleven elvish names for various forces of nature and vital things.23 This makes Alvtssmdl perhaps the second most important medieval source on dlfar, and it may be significant that Alvissmdl is the poem immediately fol- lowing Vçlundarkvioa. In Alvásmdl, the dlfar call the earth gróandi (Burgeoning) (st. 10) according to the wise dwarf. The sky they caUfagrarœfr (Fair Roof) (st. 12), the moon affali (Teller-of-Time) (st. 14), the sun fajjrahvel (Fair Wheel) (st. 16), the clouds vebrmegin (Weather-Might) (st. 18), the wind dynfari (Din Farer) (st. 20), the stiildajjsefi (Day-Balm) (st. 22), the sea lagastafr (Water) (st. 24), the woodfagrlimi (Fair Bough) (st. 28), the night svefngaman (Sleep's Ease) (st. 30), and barley is lagastafr (Grain) in elvish (st. 32) (Bugge 129-33; transi. Hollander 110-6). These words speak for themselves, as perhaps also does the fact that no elvish word 22. It is open to debate whether the name Dáinn in Hávamál refers to Óõinn or a diff- erent person who is the elves' rune teacher, Óoinn's colleague (see Motz, "Of Elves and Dwarfs" 93). Dáinn is a dwarf name in Hyndluljóõ, st. 7 (Bugge 152) but in Grímnismál (st. 33) and Snorra-Edda both names are used for stags in the world tree (Bugge 83; Finnur Jónsson 24). 23. According to this poem, the mythological beings are the y^sir (or gods), Vanir, giants, elves, and dwarfs. Some further mysterious beings are referred to once or twice including Suttungs synir. Vries ("Om Eddaens" 8) believed that these were synonymous with the alfar, and consequently assumed that the alfar had a special relationship with the mead of poetry.</page><page sequence="10">236 Scandinavian Studies is given for fire or beer. Apart from the anomaly that the alfar use the same word for the sea and barley, the elvish words seem very system- atic. They are all trisyllabic. The dominant sounds are gentle fricatives, along with the voiced plosives d and g (six of the g's in these elf words evolved into a fricative in Modern Icelandic). Three words include the morpheme^^r- "beautiful" while the night has the name svefngaman. As scholars have noted, the elvish words are gentle, beautiful, optimistic, and merry (Moberg).24 On the other hand, the words used by giants (jptnar) indicate a negative disposition, and the dwarf- words are neutral (Finnur Jónsson, Den oldnorske 170; Moberg 307-9). In Alvissmdl, the dwarfs and the àlfar are distinct groups with separate languages. Other sources indicate confusion between them or a partial fusion of the two, and some consider Vçlundarkviòa an example of such blurring. Vçlundr is a noted smith, a talent more often attributed to dwarfs than to alfar, thereby reflecting a close relationship between dark elves and dwarfs (see Motz, "Of Elves and Dwarfs" 96-7 and 106; Wanner 203-8). It is curious that of the dwarf-names from Vgluspd, three suggest alfar: Alfr, Gandalfr, Vindalfr.25 Motz has argued that the confusion went back to a common ancestor of the dwarfs, the dark elves, and Vçlundr: the divine or mythical smith called Hephaistos in Greek mythology ("Of Elves and Dwarfs" 106-18; see also Motz, The Wise One 87-137). While this conjecture is possible, it is hard to prove. Vçlundr may have things in common with dwarfs, but he is certainly not referred to as a dwarf in the poem itself. If we wish to understand Vqlundarhviba rather than its prehistory, we are left with the problem of what an alfr signifies in the poem. All in all, alfar are scarce and ill-defined in Old Norse sources. It is possible that the word "dlfr" referred to minor deities or to a special race of supernatural beings with somewhat vague characteristics. Per- haps alfar were never a clearly defined race. Yet if we try to weigh the evidence, we may come to the following tentative conclusions: 24. Moberg does not see any linguistic pattern in the elvish words and believes there is none: "This freedom of choice played an important role, for it allowed a unified character to be imposed on the content of the elves' words, to give an impression of brightness and beauty" (315). 25. Motz ("Of Elves and Dwarfs" 93) mentions further examples. Alfr is also a human name (95, 120).</page><page sequence="11">VÇLUNDR THE ELF 237 1. A fair number of Old Norse sources agree that alfar had some kind of a cult in the heathen and early Christian period; about this cult they are vague, perhaps, because alfar were considered shy of humans and tended to avoid them. 2. Alfar seem to resemble humans. There are no indications of dwarfish or gigantic size, they are able to have sexual intercourse with humans (though few do) and even ride horses. 3. The origins oí alfar are unsure. Unlike giants, dwarfs, and men, there is no Old Norse creation myth about álfar. Óláfr Geirstaõaálfr suggests the possibility of humans becoming alfar after their death, a proposition that might fit with depictions oi alfar as spirit-like creatures. However, this notion has no support in Eddie texts where alfar are usually mentioned along with the ^sir but sometimes with the Vanir as well, indicating, thus, that it was at least not generally accepted that the Vanir and the alfar were the same thing. 4. In romances, at least some alfar seem to be much darker creatures, sometimes equated with monsters and evil spirits. Snorri Sturluson resolves this apparent contradiction by dividing the alfar into two sub-types: one good, the other evil. 5 . According to Snorri, the good alfar (who perhaps define elvishness to a greater degree than the evil ones) are extremely bright and beautiful. 6. Some Eddie poems (mainly Alvissmal) also suggest that alfar were believed to be merry, optimistic, gentle, and tender creatures of great brightness and goodness. This is not much. It is not surprising that many scholars believe that alfar played an insignificant role in the Old Norse mythology. Wanner describes alfar as "litte more than a name in the extant corpus of medi- eval Scandinavian texts55 (204). Lindow does not think they exert a serious claim to an independent existence {Murder and Vengeance 13). And Liberman sums up: Then, at least in Scandinavia, elves were forgotten. From the Eddas it is impossible to piece together a consistent tale of when the elves were divided into two groups (light and dark), what relations Freyr had to the elves, why Volundr was alfa visi, and why elves, and not dwarfs, had a cult of their own. (260) The paucity of alfar and the lack of information about them in Old Norse texts makes the protagonist of Vclundarkviöa all the more important. Volundr is admittedly only one dlfr. An interpretation of</page><page sequence="12">238 Scandinavian Studies Vçlundarkviòa cannot resolve all questions about a possible cult of alfar or their status in Old Norse mythology. However, VçlundarkviOa provides a unique opportunity for a close reading of a genuine Old Norse text dealing centrally with an dlfi; which makes it an excellent starting point for determining what it meant to be an dlfr at the time of its composition. VÇLUNDR AND THE INNER LlFE Before turning to the unique features of Vçlundr, it would be useful to summarize how he accommodates the six points above: i. There is no mention of a cult in relation to Vçlundr. It is also unclear whether he has any supernatural powers. He does not need supernatural powers for anything he does. However, gods and supernatural beings often seem to have no special powers in mythic narratives. In the poems adjacent to VçlundarkviÒa in the Codex Regius, for example, I&gt;orr seems lost without his hammer in PrymskviÕa and has to use ordinary cleverness to dispose of Alviss the dwarf in Alvíssmdl. Vçlundr escapes by ascend- ing into the sky: "Hlçiandi Varlvndr hófz at lopti" (stanzas 29 and 38) [Laughing Vçlundr / lifted himself to the sky]. Scholars have not agreed on whether he used his own technical skills as a smith or is able to fly on his own.26 These facts raise the question: if he could fly by himself, why did he then not fly away sooner?- for which there is no easy answer.27 26. Nothing is explicitly said about how V. manages to fly, although he says: "Vel ... verj^a ec a fitiom" (webbed feet). That might suggest an aircraft powered by skis, which would fit into the northern setting depicted in the prose introduction. Dronke interprets the word as "vél" (trick) (321-3) and the whole passage as a reference to the treacherous wife who abandoned V. by flying away. Among scholars who believe that V used self-made wings or aircraft are Hamel (163) and McKinnell (8-9). Wings would provide a link to the Greek master-builder Daedalus whose main link with V is the Icelandic word for his labyrinth: völundarhus (see Simek, "Völundarhus- Domus Daedali"). However, that word and the concept behind it are not mentioned in the poem. Among those who believe that V used a magic ring as a means of escape is Detter; see also Boer. It has also been suggested that V. does not need wings and is able to ascend on his own, like a shaman (Grimstad 190-2, 196; see also Niedner 27). Fromm has recently argued against the shaman theory. Among scholars, only Bouman ("Vçlundr as an aviator") questions whether V. actually flew. 27. We might note the structural symmetry of the motif of Volundr's wings, since his wife had also left on wings. That might indicate that Vçlundr's anger is directed toward his wife, and not just King Níõuõr and his family (see Dronke, The Poetic Edda 11 322).</page><page sequence="13">VÇLTJNDR THE ELF 239 Although the matter is impossible to settle, there are no further examples of alfar flying in Old Norse sources. The least complicated solution seems thus to be that alfar probably do not fly and neither does Vçlundr, except as a result of his own skill. 2. The poem does not offer a detailed description of Vçlundr but mention is made of his fair-white neck ("hvitan hals") (stanza 2).28 He is called ccve]3reygr" (someone with an eye for the weather) twice in the poem (stanzas 4 and 8),29 and the evil Queen mentions his glitter- ing eyes when he has been captured. "Amon ero argo ormi J&gt;eim enom frana" (stanza 17) [His eyes remind one of the glittering serpent]. A somewhat obscure phrase about Vçlundr's hostility, "opin var illvj&gt; er |)eir 1 sa / lito" (stanzas 21 and 23) [open lay evil / as they looked in], might also refer to a danger in his eyes.30 Not just eyes but also the juxtaposition of bright and dark is a theme in the poem (Taylor, "The Structure"). Vçlundr's absconded wife is also referred to as "liossar" (st. 5) [radiant] and princess Bçõvildr is called "bráhvíto" (st. 39) [of the gleaming eyelashes]. Vçlundr thus seems to be bright, perhaps even as bright as the light alfar of Snorri's Edda. His eyes also attract attention. Nothing is said of his physique, but he seems to have no difficulty killing the sons of King Níõuõr (st. 24) or plying Princess Bçõvildr with drink in order to impregnate her (st. 28 and 36)31 so he is hardly a little gnome. In fact, stanza 8 gives an impression of an athletic hunter who is able to slay bears on his own: "Com ]}ar af veij)i / veJDreygr scyti, / Wlvndr li^andi / vm langan veg" [Came there from hunting / the storm-watching marksman, / Vçlundr ranging / on a long road]. Perhaps he kills them with his bow as is suggested by the word scyti (marksman). When Vçlundr has been captured, NíõucVs queen calls him a serpent and suggests that he bares his teeth ("tenn hanom teygiaz") when he 28. It is the swan-maiden that enfolds Vçlundr's fair- white neck, which is interesting in itself, since swans do have long white necks. See Dronke, The Poetic Edda 11 262; McKinnell 9-10. 29. Dronke translates as "storm- watching (245-6). 30. Dronke explains this rather nicely as two things becoming open or patent along with the coffer: the malignity of the jewels and the malevolence of Vçlundr (The Poetic Edda 11 316). 31. This appears to have been a part of the legend for a long time since the cup of beer seems to be represented on the ancient Franks Casket (see Souers).</page><page sequence="14">24-O Scandinavian Studies recognizes his sword in Niouor's possession and his ring on Bçõvildr (stanza 17). 32 The sons of the King and Queen are eager to see the "beast53 Vçlundr (stanza 20). 33 And yet he is also a hunter of animals, at least of bears (st. 8 and 9), as is first shown by his return from a bear hunt, which may be echoed when the King's young sons are called "hvna" (cubs) after their deaths (stanzas 24 and 34; see also stanza 32). Fur- thermore, he lives in a place called Úlfdalir (st. 5 and 6), which recalls the importance not only of bears but also of dogs and wolves in Old Norse mythology and the heroic poetry of the Elder Edda. Vçlundr's relationship with animals is at best ambiguous.34 He is compared to one by his captors, and a prose interjection states that everyone is afraid of him: "Engi maj^r jx&gt;r]}i at farà til hans nema konvngr einn" (between st. 17 and 18) [No man dared to go to him except only the King]. To summarize, Vçlundr seems to be of human size and resembles a human at least enough to be attractive to Princess Bçõvildr and to seem harmless to the two young princes, and yet he is described with metaphors of bestiality when he is held captive. 3 . Vçlundr's origins are vague. In the prose introduction, he is a Sámi prince. In the poem, there is no father, only Egill and Slagfiõr- who may or may not be his brothers. Vçlundr is the prince of elves but there is no clear indication of what that entails. 4-6 . Vçlundr is hard to categorize as either good or evil. He commits cruel and frightening acts before flying away while laughing. But then, he had been grievously wronged. When he sits alone and abandoned and waits for his wife, he seems gentle and kind and harmless. How- ever, after his imprisonment and torment, he is merciless and strikes out against the young, innocent, and trusting. Instead of the either/or situation in the Eddie and the legendary texts, this is an elf who has characteristics of both the light and the dark alfar (see Motz, "Of Elves and Dwarfs" 97). He is a gifted smith capable of harshness and cruelty 32. She also suggests that he lives in the woods: "era sa nv hyrr / er or holti ferr" (stanza 16). See also Burson 14. Lassen discusses the motif of serpent eyes in Old Norse texts (39-42). 33. Grimstad also reads the word "dyr" in this way (198) whereas other scholars have suggested "door" or "riches" (e.g. Gering and Sijmons 17; Kock, esp. 107-9. See also von See, et al. 204-5). 34. Grimstad's (196-8) interpretation of the examples above (and others) is that V was a dwarf/elf who could function as a shaman capable of changing into animal or bird form.</page><page sequence="15">Vqlundr the Elf 241 as well a serene and peaceful being, the very picture of innocence who spends his time hunting in the forests and making precious items for his own delight. If we regard Snorri's division as secondary, this apparent contradiction may lie at the heart of the poem's portrayal of the elvish character, and its resolution is to my mind the task facing the reader of VçlundarkviÒa. Vçlundr may thus be regarded in many ways as a typical Old Norse dlfr: vaguely supernatural, of dubious origins, resembling humans to a degree, but also more bright and gentle, and yet more dangerous. The Queen's attempt to stigmatize him as an animal is revealing. She is indicating that in spite of his human appearance, he is the Other. It may be precisely his Otherness which attracts her small sons but repels the King's men who fear him because they do not and cannot know him. As the Other, Vçlundr is just one of many supernatural and ethnic Others available to the poem's audience (see Lindow, "Supernatural Others"; McKinnell, Meeting the Other). But his lack of physical abnormality makes his Otherness less conspicous so that the Queen has to insist that he has the eyes of a serpent and threatening teeth. While giants are often supposed to be large and dwarfs short (which is not unproblematic, but that is another story), elves are frustratingly normal in appearance, which fact raises the question of wherein their Otherness lies. The Queen's attempt to categorize Vçlundr as an animal may be understood within a Lévi-Straussian interpretation focusing on the binary opposition between nature and culture, the wild and the civilized, animals and humans, the unknown and the known, freedom and slavery, and the list could go on (see Burson 12-5). I consider this not only a possible interpretation of the poem, but one that is almost impossible to avoid. It is also somewhat reductive and leaves out some significant aspects of the poem. I would also argue that there is a fundamental difference between the Otherness of alfar and that of beasts. Of importance here is the fact that Vçlundr is the protagonist of the poem, and since significant parts of the poem are related from his point of view, the representatives of civilization become the aliens. Perhaps it is precisely this ambiguity of the nature-culture binary or the unclear boundary between the wild and the civilized that alfar is uniquely qualified to capture. Vçlundr is not merely the Other, a force of nature that strikes the wicked who have erred. This role is indeed a function oí alfar but not the sole one. If we consider only this function, it seems logical that</page><page sequence="16">242 Scandinavian Studies Vçlundr's revenge is aimed at the children of his oppressor. A natural catastrophe does not spare the innocents, the death and rape of whom is by far the harshest punishment of their parents. That scenario would be consistent with the logic of folktales as well illustrated in the tale of the Pied Piper, who took the children to punish the parents.35 However, the murder of the children seems more obscure if we look at it from Vçlundr's point of view- and that perspective is important. Vçlundr is only partly the Other: he is also the protagonist and human focal point of the poem.36 His role as protagonist is indeed complex since it requires that the Other demands our sympathy. The nature of his revenge must accommodate the fact that he is the Other and yet not quite alien. How is Vçlundr strange? I would contend that the Queen has no case because his Otherness is not on the outside but on the inside- it is psychological rather than physical. He is not totally alien because anthropomorphic, supernatural Others always reflect Us. Indeed, their main function is to define the Self, as Ohle (97) has remarked: without the Other, there is no Self, and without the unknown, nothing can be known. Ana alfar intrinsically have the same function as other supernatu- ral Others: to define Us. In referring to the inside of Vçlundr, I mainly have in mind his emotions as they seem more prominent in the poem than logic, and I will contend that VçlundarkviÒa is a poem of excessive emotions (see Sävborg 62-8). Thus, I will be discussing Otherness as a psychological rather than a social phenomenon (see McKinnell, Meet- ing the Other 26-34), which is not to say that it is not both. It might seem strange to speak of emotions in connection with heroic poetry, 35. Warner uses this example in her interesting book about children, parents, and bogeymen who attack children (29-30). Her book is a reminder that both in folktales and real life, children are more susceptible to catastrophe than others; only in the fantastic world of modern Hollywood catastrophe movies do children usually seem to be immune from the cruel fate that befalls the adults when the catastrophe hits. Dieterle (8-10) also sees youth and metal as important opposites in the poem. There may also be a logic of inversion in his method: Níõuõr killed Volundr's innocence by attacking him, maiming and enslaving him for no better reason than to satisfy his own lust for gold. Níõuõr is himself old and full of sin so the best revenge is to attack his connection with innocence, his children. If we regarded Vçlundr as an epic hero, his vengeance would follow a logic of family ties directed not against individuals, but against the bloodline. The ultimate revenge would then be killing all the offspring save the one impregnated with Volundr's own child- so that Níõuõr has to endure the thought of his line being replaced by Volundr's flesh and blood. See e.g. Murdoch 53-8. 36. In Alaric Hall's framework, alfar are clearly aligned with gods and humans against monsters in a human/monstrous binary (50-4).</page><page sequence="17">Vqltjndr the gLF 2^ which may seem lacking in feeling while being rather full of icy rhetoric and heroic self-possession- recently characterized as "a kaleidoscopic series of vivid, often bloodcurdling moments designed to exhibit and exalt heroic and highly unnatural behavior" (Andersson 198). Anders- son also notes that "the style is one of compression, indirection, irony, high gesture, and perverse exaltation." But these are just the trappings. I would contend (following Dronke who, in the introduction to her edition, has captured well the emotionality of VçlundarkviÕa) that the self-possession and the icy rhetoric conceal an extreme emotional life although the emotions are mostly hidden. So, when the emotional character of Vçlundr is examined, it may be therein that his Otherness lies. But which emotions are most prominent in the poem? Excessive revenge is unquestionably a dominant theme. According to the poem, the wronged elf does not kill his enemy but his two young sons and goes on to fashion jewels out of their bodies and impregnate the daughter of the house thus going well beyond the principle of an eye for an eye. The extent of violence may seem less shocking from the safe distance at which we ascribe it to a long-gone heathen mentality. It is also a pervasive belief- unsubstantiated by any factual examina- tion-that brutality is a more prominent feature of the past than the present and that in the past people would have been less shocked and moved by violence. But in spite of a lack of authorial comments in Eddie poems to indicate disapproval, it seems unfair to assume that killings, mutilation of slain bodies, and cannibalism were any less shocking to the majority than they are today. In fact, a thirteenth-century audience might have regarded Vçlundr's revenge with even more qualms than we do. Clark (174-6) has indeed argued that heroic poetry may reveal a conscious effort to distance the violent past from the present and that the enormous interest in violence need not signify approval.37 And we should keep in mind that the thirteenth century embodied a strong drive to control violence, which was no less prominent in Iceland than other European countries but more pertinent since the whole country was on the brink of civil war (Sverrir Jakobsson). While Vçlundr's revenge has its counterparts in heroic poetry, it is preceded by an unusual and fascinating inertia that may seem hard to reconcile with his revenge at the end of the poem. His initial behavior is in fact characterized by patience, innocence, and passivity, which seem 37. See my own analysis oíSturlungasaga (Ármann Jakobsson, "Sannyrõi"; "Snorri and His Death").</page><page sequence="18">244 Scandinavian Studies contrary to his aggressive, manipulative, and grizzly revenge later on. After the three swan-maidens leave their husbands, never to be seen again, Vçlundr's brothers react in the normal folktale manner and immediately embark on a quest for their eloped wives.38 Only Vçlundr stays where he is. This decision may be regarded as practical thinking: why go on a wild goose (or swan) chase when the most sensible course of action after having lost someone is to remain stationary and await the return (McKinneU 17)? Vçlundr indeed becomes happy when he finds that he is one ring short and takes this as a sign that his wife is back: "eins sacnaõi; / hvgõi harm at hefj&gt;i / Hlarõvéss dóttir, / Alvitr vnga, / vçri hon aptr komin" (stanza 10) [one he missed. / He thought that she had it, / Hlçover's daughter / -foreign being, young- / that she had come back].39 His lassitude seems to be based on optimistism. Nevertheless, both the example of the brothers and folkloristic custom indicate that Vçlundr's passive reaction to his wife's departure is eccentric, if logical. Although his emotions may be normal enough, his reactions, or lack thereof, are definitely unusual. Vçlundr's inertia may be interpreted as melancholy. Later, he mournfully recalls the marital bliss with his wife, which borders on the melancholic: "man ec at ver mçiri / mçti attorn, / er ver heil hiv / heima vorom" (stanza 14) [I remember that we owned / a greater treasure / when we were a whole family / in our home].40 It has been suggested that Vçlundr has trouble sleeping and sits instead obsessively count- ing his rings (Dronke, The Poetic Edda 11 256). Later this restlessness is transferred to the evil Queen who roams the corridors of the royal palace (stanza 29) while King Níõuõr complains of sleep deprivation (stanza 31). In psychoanalytic theory, melancholy is defined as a contradictory emotion: the bereaved abuses himself constantly but indulges in nar- cissism and refuses to put his energy to profitable use (see e.g. Freud, 38. Although protagonists of bridal- quest romances are usually somewhat aggressive, there is also a more passive type. Volundr, however, is more passive than most (see Kalinke 111-55). 39. Dronke (The Poetic Edda n 302-4) discusses the word "alvitr" and its possible mean- ings in detail (see von See, et al. 128-30; McKinnell 1-2, 6). 40 . While Vçlundr may be regarded as being in deep mourning for his wife when he starts his long wait for her (stanza 5), there is no actual statement to that effect in the poem until later, when he describes the swan-maidens as more precious than gold (stanza 14). He also bemoans the theft of the sword he forged himself and the ring that belonged to his wife (stanza 18).</page><page sequence="19">VÇLUNDR THE ELF 245 "Trauer und Melancholie") . This contrast between self-love and the love of a lost object is not only consistent with the depiction of Vçlundr in the first part of the poem, but also accords with the contrasts in the nature of the kind and yet cruel alfar. Although this analysis describes Vçlundr's state of mind before he is shocked into action by his arrest, it is debatable how languorous and inert he is. He continues making jewelry out of gold although he seems to lack a clear purpose, goes out to hunt, and seems to take care of himself. Vçlundr's psychological state is thus not easily fathomable. What he expresses is perhaps simply a nostalgia for his wife, which may be melancholic but does not have to be. But if we believe that Vçlundr is in a melancholic state when attacked, there is an irony to his revenge: since he was unhappy before his capture, his mental pain was only exchanged for a physical pain. Vçlundr's enforced exile thus echoes his previous self-imposed exile. His revenge on Níõuõr and his family, thus, may seem strange, and one would have to wonder whether, as some scholars have suggested, in the end the wicked King becomes a surrogate, not only for the faithless wife but also for Vçlundr himself, who had confined himself before being forcibly confined.41 We have thus on one hand lassitude and possibly melancholy, on the other the excessive cruelty of the revenge. They need not be incompat- ible. There are two types of cruelty in the poem: on the one hand, the calculated purposeful cruelty of the King, who wants Vçlundr's gold and is ready to rob, disable, and enslave him to achieve this purpose; on the other hand, the sudden and extravagant cruelty of Vçlundr who avenges himself on Níõuõr by attacking, killing, and raping his inno- cent children. Niouor's crime against Vçlundr is cold, practical, and unemotional. The King is driven by greed and has no special wish to harm Vçlundr although he has no qualms about injuring him to make better use of him. Vçlundr introduces emotions by abusing the trust of 41. Motz ("New Thoughts") and Dronke (The Poetic Edda 11 255-8) have emphasized the link between the swan-maidens and the revenge. Dronke believes that the swan-maidens originally represent the Other but feel imprisoned in a marriage with the three brothers. Then, in the second half, it is Vçlundr's turn to be the imprisoned alien. McKinnell (16-22) sees the interest in women in the poem as negative as they are depicted as agents of evil. Dronke focuses on the duality in human nature, exemplified first by the swan-maidens but then by Vçlundr. Motz ("New Thoughts") believes the two narratives to have been intertwined prior to the poem (see also the counter- arguments of McKinnell 13-4).</page><page sequence="20">246 Scandinavian Studies the children in order to kill the boys and subsequently making love to a young girl only to abandon her as he himself had been abandoned by his wife.42 In contrast to the King's lust for gold and power, Vçlundr's revenge is personal, even loving, since it conjoins the predator and the victim in a new family. Love and loss go hand in hand in the poem, and in Vçlundr's revenge, love and violence are united in aggression. And yet love is not only tinged with death and violence, it also signifies the new life of the unborn fruit of Bçovildr's womb, the pregnancy which assures Vçlundr's triumph over the King. Although the initial inertia in the face of adversity does not seem consistent with the unrestrained revenge that replaces it, neither is Vçlundr's melancholic (or nostalgic) love for his wife compatible with his hatred of his oppressor and his family: an excess to all Vçlundr's emotions may well serve as the common denominator. The same excess is present in other heroic poems in the Poetic Edda such as Atlakvièa and the lays of Helgi Hundingsbani, in which on one hand we have the intense love between siblings and spouses, but on the other the cruel fact of a violent society where betrayal and death part lovers and families. In that respect, heroic poetry may reflect medieval society in transition- whether we term it viking, pre-chivalric, or chivalric- in which violence was considered an essential part of human nature and aggression was commended but was slowly becoming more and more restricted (see Elias 156-68). Nevertheless, there is a singular chiarascuro effect in VçlundarkviÕa, a contradiciton between a gentle, reflective, and mournful protagonist and his enormously wicked actions. And only in VçlundarkviÒa is the protagonist an dlfr The apparent contradictions in heroic poems in general may be partly resolved by Freud's analysis of the erotic and thanatic instincts (see e.g. "Jenseits des Lustprinzips"), which according to Dollimore (256) may have roots in a very old mythology. In Freud's analysis, the erotic instinct may not lead to a long life, but certainly to a more intense one. The intensity of love causes people to feel more alive, frivolous, or youthful. Oddly, this fact makes love and death natural partners that are often intertwined in the young.43 Adults approaching their death tend 42. McKinnell (23-4) has reservations about the poetic justice in the revenge of Vçlundr, if the princess is made to pay on behalf of the wife who fled. Bonsack (113) argues that Niouor's wife is identical with Vçlundr's wife who is, according to him, also Vçlundr's daughter by Freyja, but his logical leaps are far too great for this author. 43. This apparent contradiction is also discussed by Warner (48-77), whose focus is the contradictions of the Kronos myth.</page><page sequence="21">VÇLLJNDR THE ELF 247 not to court death or challenge it as the young sometimes do (a theme seen in the Eddie myth of the fearless youth SigurÕr Fáfnisbani). These flirtations with death may make young adults seem more alive than the old: being alive means not shunning death, while avoiding danger is thanatic. Thus the heroes and heroines of Eddie poetry, such as Guõrun Gjúkadóttir and Signin, lead an erotic existence while the thanatic drive is perhaps best exemplified by the aging Egill Skalla-Grimsson, who withdraws to his bed-closet to starve himself passively to death (although it is open to debate how successful Egill is in being passive) (see Ármann Jakobsson, "The Specter"). This bed-closet mentality is also visible in Vçlundr in the first part of Vçlundarkvioa. While not close to death, he seems to have stopped living, rendering his lack of aggression thanatic. Vçlundr's double-edged revenge may be paradoxi- cal in that to him death signifies vitality, just as love equals life. That perception might explain why his revenge hits the young of the family. The cruelty of killing echoes the cruelty of love, and love may provide a good reason, perhaps the only one, for killing someone. This is an Eddie sentiment: the heroic poems of 'the Poetic Edda often intertwine love and death, making violence noble, heroic, and even inevitable. To Vçlundr, revenge means a new life life- aggression, as a positive force, replacing inactivity. His revenge is cruel but not impersonal. Just as Vçlundr is very emotional, so are other exceptional Eddie heroes. What they are not is inert or passive. But keeping the erotic and thanatic instincts in mind, one may argue that after the elopement of his wife, Vçlundr is overtaken by the latter. Instead of (prudently or foolishly) going to seek her, he quietly stays at home, and his existence is perhaps not as much unhappy as languorous and unadventurous. But when Níõuõr enslaves him, he is forced to take action and become aggressive. Vçlundr seems at first to be innocent. He certainly is not on his guard and thus easy to capture when he falls asleep believing in his wife's return (stanzas io and n). This behavior betrays a certain innocence or childish naïveté: the last thing Vçlundr seems to expect is enemies coming for his gold. Perhaps alfar are innocent compared to humans and lack understanding of human motives and, in particular, human dishonesty and greed. This innocence would make them no less dangerous. In fact, the psychologist Rollo May argued in his influential study of violence that innocence is potentially extremely dangerous. To him, violence is the expression of powerlessness, whereas aggression is a necessary life-force, the need to realize oneself. Taking this view, it would thus be Vçlundr's non- aggression early on in the poem that leads to his</page><page sequence="22">248 Scandinavian Studies excessive violence in the end. Vçlundr's revenge not only bears some resemblance to the well-known theme, common in Icelandic romances (see for example Schlauch 95-9), of timid coalbiters suddenly shocked into action, but also reflects a common occurence in the human world: patient and reasonable people may erupt in uncontrollable anger after having suffered in silence for too long. Perhaps this tendency explains why alfar can be both dangerous and non-aggressive. The complexity of the binary relationship of love/life and death is exemplified by the coda, which undermines the revenge narrative. After stanza 38, Vçlundr's episodes are suddenly over. King Níõuõr calls his servant Èakkráõr, a new character introduced into the poem in the third to last stanza for no apparent reason. He asks Bçõvildr about her relations with the elf prince: usatv]3 i]} Volvndr / saman i holmi?" (stanza 40). The poem ends with Bçovildr's answer: "sato vi]} Varlvndr / saman i holmi / eina argurstvnd, / çva scyldi; / ec vçtr hanom / vinna kvnnac, / ec vçtr hanom / vinna máttac" (stanza 41) [Vçlundr and I sat / together on the island / -only the time of the tide's turning- / it should never have happened! / 1 did not at all know / how to harm him, / 1 couldn't / harm him at all] .M After the revenge, the poem suddenly ends in a gentle elegy (see Dronke, The Poetic Edda 11 279). Vçlundr may have the last laugh but not the last word. The logical conclusion of the story is death, pain, and misery, but the poem is artistically arranged so that it ends before the end- which is unusual, though not unique, for an Eddie poem. The artistic arrangement of the poem is also tragically ironic in that it reflects reality. Only in poetry can love survive in the artistic rearrangement of the facts to assure that the end is happy. In actual life, a happy end is unthinkable : every love affair ends in separation and the individual being left by his or her lover. There is no happy end, unless we invent it. In art, however, love may survive even when it dies - a possibility that may epitomize the value of heroic poetry for its audience. The end is not the end; the poem does not conclude with the aftermath of the revenge, but the moment before when the young 44. Dronke translates vinna as "prevent," but I believe that Bçõvildr does not have to be physically unable to assail Vçlundr, just mentally unable. Motz ("New Thoughts" 58) translates as: "To withstand him I had neither strength nor knowledge," but I think the line (which is admittedly obscure) could just as well refer to a lack of inclination to harm (compare stanza 6 of Sonatorrek where vinna must be translated as "harm").

This conclusion might seem an unsatisfactory ending in the light of stanza 28, where Vçlundr apparently plies Bçõvildr with drink in order to impregnate the unconscious girl. But however mistaken she was, Bçõvildr imagined the whole thing as true love and the illusionary love at the end is strangely satisfying if the purpose of the álfr is to allow the humans to understand themselves. In this case, what Bçõvildr finds within herself is the ideal of love, which is stronger than the cruelty surrounding it. On the logical level, violence is triumphant, but the poem nevertheless ends with the impossibility of violence: Bçovildr's repeated statement about the harm she cannot do. What the self-possession and the icy rhetoric thus conceal is a larger- than-life emotional life where emotions are usually hidden but only erupt occasionally and often in violence. In fact, using May's logic, the violence of the Eddie world and the sagas might perhaps be caused by their emotional reticence. All this might seem to have little to do with elves, yet passivity, love, and revenge lie at the heart of this unique poem about an elvish protagonist. I would argue that alfar, like Eddie heroes, are full of apparent contradictions. Snorri must divide them into two groups to resolve them, the light and the dark ones. Alvissmdl presents them as exceptionally gentle and kind, optimistic and merry, which may explain Niouor's attack on Vçlundr. The grasping king might seem to have some cause not to expect excessive cruelty from the sweet- dispositioned creatures who use such beautiful words as Fair Roof, Fair Wheel, and Day-Balm- and for whom even sleep is an especially merry occasion. And it is not only the mirth of the alfar that makes them seem harm- less. They also seem optimistic and innocent, even naïve. The alfar of Alvíssmál tend to see the bright side of things and Vçlundr interprets the theft of his ring as the return of his wife. And yet in the end the King has to pay a dear price for having wronged the alfe, just as King Helgi in Hrólfssaga kraka and people who deal with alfar in later folktales. As mentioned, alfar in legendary sagas seem on the whole to be somewhat sinister and frightening. In post-medieval Icelandic folktales, alfar are as a rule bright and noble creatures and yet godless and dangerous, especially if not treated properly. Interaction between humans and alfar often results in either reward or retribution depending on how the humans behave. Thus it is no wonder that humans are fascinated but also frightened by them (see Einar Ó1. Sveinsson, Um tslenzkar pjoösößur 158-62; Jon Hnefill Aõalsteinsson, "Giants and</page><page sequence="24">25O Scandinavian Studies Elves"; Grimstad 200. See also McKinnell 24-5). These later alfar are often somewhat passive and shy away from humans. In medieval sources, alfar seem to be even more inactive except in rare instances in legendary sagas, and it is perhaps possible to attribute their low profile in medieval sources to a notion that the alfar were withdrawn and unaggressive. The Otherness oí alfar reflects their value as representations of our- selves, and I would contend, mainly our emotional life. Even though alfar are supernatural and thus strange, they are also human- human and yet not quite human at the same time. Vçlundr is Us and the Other in one form. The álfr and other anthropomorphic supernatural Others may be seen as metaphors for the estrangement and empathy that sometimes go hand in hand but sometimes clash in human soci- ety. But the Otherness the alfr embodies is not restricted to society but to human existence itself. The álfr represents humanity in its most vulnerable and naked state, within the loneliness of its emotional life, where the human being conceives of himself not merely as a familiar I, but also a strange unchartered land he must spend his life trying to explore. As an alfr, Vçlundr is both strange and familiar and so are his emotions. They are excessive because supernatural Others tend to be exaggerations of humanity. Some are gigantic, others very small, and some experience extremes in their emotional lives . When alfar are merry, they are extremely merry. When they are kind, they are very kind. When they are wicked and cruel, there are no holds barred. The excess of Alfar does not manifest itself in size but may do so in their emotional life, and therefore Vçlundr may serve as a figure for the excessive and uncontrollable emotions of humans. He is the non-aggressive, kind, gentle, optimistic, and naïve side of humanity that, when provoked, may surprisingly metamorphose into cruelty and wickedness. He is a reminder of what is buried inside us under layers of self-control.</page><page sequence="25">Vqltjndr the Elf 251 Works Cited Andersson, Theodore M.
