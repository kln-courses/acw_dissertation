<plain_text><page sequence="1">OVID'S COSMOGONY By William C. Johnson Northern Illinois University •T" hat Ovid begins his Metamorphoses with a description of chaos is no surprise, considering both the tra- dition in which he writes and the tone he attempts to establish. A full eighty-five lines (5-89), beginning with "Ante mare et terras et quod te- git omnia caelum, / unus erat toto naturae vultus in orbe, / quem dix- ere chaos," are devoted to pre- creation. The most "natural" source for such an introduction would of course appear to be Hesiod, whose Theogony seems to have set the pat- tern for the "epic" use of cosmogo- nies. However, we find an even closer and more interesting parallel between Ovid and the cosmological and mytho- logical song of Silęnus in Vergil's sixth eclogue. Both authors first pre- sent the state of the universe before the world's creation, then describe the creation itself, and only then describe the gods; other accounts, most notably those patterned after Hesiod, describe first the origin of the Olympians and then their creation of the world. Ovid, for example, pictures the uni- verse as " ... rudis indigestaque moles / nec quicquam nisi pondus iners congestaque eodem / non bene iunctarum discordia semina rerum." Vergil paints a similar picture: "Nam- que canebat uti magnum per inane coacta I semina terrarumque ani- maeque marisque fuissent / et li- quidi simul ignis." The creation it- self is described by both more as the Epicurean concourse of atoms - note particularly the Lucretian echo in the use of semina - than as the result of anthropomorphic beings ac- tively engaged in assembling a world. Vergil describes the creation as a process by which the semina im- planted themselves as the elements organized. His Silenus tells us " ... ut his exordia primis / omnia et ipse tener mundi concreverit orbis; / tum durare solum et discludere Nerea Ponto / coeperit et rerum pau- latim sumere formas." Ovid, who first says that " ... nulli sua for- ma manebat / obstabatque aliis ali- ud quia corpore in uno / frigida pug- nabant calidis, umentia siccis, / mol- lia cum duris, sine pondere haben- tia pondus," goes on to say how an unnamed deity reconstructed the mass: "quae postquam evolvit caecoque exemit acervo, / dissociata locis con- cordi pace ligavit." It is perhaps significant too that neither Ovid nor Vergil pursued the matter further in these works. For Vergil the cosmogony was here only a preface to, and a part of, Silenus' bucolic song. For Ovid it was far less an exercise in philosophy than it was an eloquent prelude to the sto- ries of re-creation, the metamor- phoses, about which he was writing. &lt;*3</page></plain_text>
