INTRODUCTION I THE ENUMERATION OF PRECEPTS ALTHOUGI the Mosaic laws must have been exhaustively summed up during the early tannaitic period, no exact number of precepts contained in the Pentateuch is found in the Mishnah or Tosefta. The first indisputably explicit statement that the Lord gave Moses 613 precepts at Mount Sinai is that of R. Simlai,1 a preacher of the third Christian century.2 At first sight one is inclined to assume that R. Simlai is responsible for this far- 1 This is the traditional pronunciation of this name.

Simlai preached: six hundred and thirteen precepts were revealed unto Moses, three hundred and sixty-five negative precepts, like the number of the days of the solar year, and two hundred and forty-eight positive precepts, corresponding to the number of the limbs of the human body (Makkot 23 b).

Moise Bloch who adopts this view gives an elaborate explanation of this talmudic passage.3 It is well known that many religious disputations took place between Jews and Christians during the third and fourth centuries. To some extent there was a danger that the line of demarcation between Jews and Christians would be removed, especially on account of the Jewish Christians. R. Simlai, a contemporary of Origen with whom he probably had some discussions, foresaw this danger, and in order to guard against the possible abrogation of certain ordinances, declared that just as the organization of the human body and the course of the sun are immutable, so are the Mosaic laws. Accordingly, the number 613 is not to be taken mathematically but sym- bolically. R. Simlai never meant to convey that all the Mosaic precepts amount to 613, but wished to emphasize their immutability by comparing them with two immutable phenomena of nature whose sum is 613. However fascinating this theory may appear, there are serious objections which tend to invalidate it. To begin with, this number is found in the Midrashim, and is spoken of by subsequent Amoraim, as a fixed dogma.4 Had R. Simlai been the originator of this number, this statement would have been ascribed to him in at least one passage. One would expect to find such an assertion introduced by some such words as 4S~t,n i ~nn'lt, as is customary throughout the Talmud. It is almost inconceivable that 3 REJ., I, p. 208. 4 See Tanhtuma, Ki Tese, ed. Buber, 2; Exod. Rabba 32. i; Num. Rabba 13. i6; i8. 21; Shabbat 87 a; Yebamot 47 b; Nedarim 25 a; Shebu'ot 29 a. In all these places the statement that there are 613 precepts is indirectly referred to, and is obviously taken as a well-known fact. 520</page><page sequence="3">HEFES B. YASLIAH'S BOOK OF PRECEPTS-HALPER 521 a statement for which an individual preacher is responsible should be quoted as a self-evident truth which requires no support. Nobody in the Talmud or in the Midrash entertains any doubt as to the accuracy of the number. Such a fact would be all the stranger if R. Simlai intended that number to be symbolical. For it is obvious from the midrashic and talmudic passages that this number was taken in its mathematical sense. Moreover, there are two passages in which Tannaim of the second century are credited with the knowledge of this number. In the Mekilta 5 R. Simon b. Eleazar is reported to have said: NK rn$ nirY prnt m =n no nnlmm in p 'n:n 6rim ,Dr no3 nnK p now ; wvSwi nmwo wr n Dnmz -tI, S i%. If the children of Noah could not fulfil seven precepts, how much less will they be able to fulfil six hundred and thirteen ! It should be observed that this passage offers no conclusive evidence, since at the beginning the number is not men- tioned, and Bloch may be right in considering it a later interpolation. Weiss,6 whom Bloch does not quote, arrives at the same conclusion, because in Yalkut Shim'oni the number is missing. This point, therefore, need not be pressed. The other passage, however, is of greater weight. It occurs in Sifre,7 and is as follows: Ky p jp ; W n0 '&amp;&lt; 1tz KN'Iw nl1=n 5nz ;sxw nin-i nwyn S wnnl DWW'I nvv i n,)Ni 53 nivW r5y m nin ~i'nmn 13 p niyon i: jp= -Nw nD n, ~. ~lKp niglnh. R.

Friedmann, p. gob). 002</page><page sequence="4">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW lightest of allprecepts, how mucih more art thou warned with regard to other precepts ! Here we even have the exact number of the negative precepts. There is no possibility of interpolation, unless the whole passage is corrupt, or the name of the Tanna is to be replaced by that of an Amora. But as there is no independent reason for doubting the authenticity of this passage, it must be allowed to stand as it is. A weighty objection to Bloch's view is also furnished by the very passage in which R. Simlai's statement is recorded. The explanation which that Amora offers is too flimsy to have suggested the number. Had he been at liberty to choose any number he pleased, he would have adopted one which would have made the thought of immutability more evident. For few people would associate the days of the year (not the course of the sun) and the members of the human body with the idea of immutability. Moreover, he might have at least chosen the lunar system rather than the solar. The impression one gains from that passage, therefore, is that R. Simlai offered a homiletic explanation for a well-known tradition. The novelty of his exposition does not lie in the number, but in the reason which he assigns to it. There is accordingly nothing against the view of regard- ing this number as a tannaitic tradition. The scribes who counted every letter of the law8 could not have neglected to investigate the number of precepts. Bloch objects to this hypothesis, because by fixing the number of precepts the scribes would have been barred from finding a basis in the Pentateuch for their innovations; and a distinction would have been drawn between Mosaic and later ordinances.9 8 Kiddushin 30 a. 9 RAJ., I p. 200. 522</page><page sequence="5">HEFES B. YASLIAH'S BOOK OF PRECEPTS-HALPER 523 This is, however, no weighty objection, as such a distinction would be noticed even if the precepts were not counted. The Rabbis in any case differentiated between Mosaic laws (nin :in) and Rabbinic institutions (nmrn :n). Nowhere is there a tendency to consider the two as one category. But beyond a mere statement, no indication is found in talmudic or midrashic literature as to the actual enumeration. Nor is there any reference to a method by which the number 613 is to be obtained. The earliest attempt known to us to give the individual precepts is that found at the beginning of the Halakot Gedolot. The authorship of this halakic work is variously attributed to R. Jehudai Gaon and to R. Simon Kayyara. Hardly anything is known of the life of either of these men, but it is certain that they flourished in the eighth century. Two different recensions have been transmitted, and there can be no doubt that the text, which is sometimes inconsistent, has been tampered with.10 A number of Halakists must have followed the method of the author of the Halakot Gedolot whom they recognized as the foremost authority. For Maimonides, who severely criticizes this method, remarks : 1 :i N Kn5:ya wy in 73 i 7 t6i n65n =vl n anr n an va nI p tii -n 1* t 4W =snn rnap b5I3)5 jfK m-InD4 Nawlnn ti NI&lt;1Ty 4'D 12 l mnSS tp ij sDnr i'54N Ki,n 5ip -uy. For all who occupied themselves with enumerating them (the precepts) or with composing a book on this subject followed the author of the Halakot Gedolot, and they only slightly deviated from his opinions, as if the 10 See L.

See Dozy, s. v.</page><page sequence="6">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW intellects stopped still at the decision of this man. These works, however, are not preserved. Instead, we have a number of Azharot which enumerate the precepts in poetic form. The oldest extant is that which begins nim,n nnK. The author of this composition is unknown, but it is surmised that he flourished in the eighth century, and was influenced by the Halakot Gedolot. Judging by the number of Azharot that have been transmitted, it seems that almost every liturgic poet took the precepts as his theme. Sa'adya Gaon, with his amazing versatility, composed two such poems. Some writers even tried their skill in employing the Arabic language to enumerate the precepts in metrical and rhyming lines. Fragments of two such attempts, obviously by different authors, are found at the Dropsie College. Although the Azharot seldom had any halakic value, they exercised some influence as liturgic compositions. They reached their culminating point in Ibn Gabirol whose Azharot are still recited in some congregations. While practically all these writers followed the author of the Halakot Gedolot blindly, Hefes b. Yasliah seems to have questioned the validity of that method. Here again we have the testimony of Maimonides who observes:13 im ;o CDFw ti Ny n 5:n nnN-1 SnrrK ywtv rNo ntn Int Ig s? V 3&lt; n inin ns^ln -1np 5 rr ,nT DWn nl:5nitt nny nrDnii 3nty. The author of the famzous Book of Precepts (or the famous author of the Book of Precepts) took notice of the errors of the author of the Halakot Gedolot, and considered it strange that visiting the sick and consoling the mtourners should be counted, as did the author of the Halakot. It is the merit of Rapoport to have been the first to suggest that 18 Op. Cit.. p. 5. 524</page><page sequence="7">HEFES B. YASLIAH'S BOOK OF PRECEPTS-HALPER 525 by 'the author of the famous Book of Precepts' Hefes b. Yasliah is meant.14 This conjecture finds striking confirmation in Judah ibn Bal'am's commentary on Deuteronomy. For in that passage it is explicitly stated that Hefes had objected to the method of a writer who had included the visiting of sick and the consoling of mourners among the precepts.15 Maimonides, who was in this respect anticipated by Ibn Bal'am,16 found the method of Hefes inconsistent.'7 He therefore laid down fourteen principles (5I~N), in order to guard against all possible fallacies. Although Maimonides is not quite fiee from inconsisten- cies, as was shown by Nahmanides in his Refutations or Objections (nuwr), it must be granted that for logical enumeration he deserves the palm. Subsequent writers, like Moses of Coucy and Isaac of Corbeil, follow him with but few deviations. It may thus be said that there are three main systems in enumerating the precepts: (i) that of the Halakot Gedolot; (2) that of Hefes b. Yasliah ; and (3) that of Maimonides. Against the literal interpretation of the idea that there are 613 precepts in the Pentateuch, protests were now and again heard. Judah ibn Bal'am was, as far as is known, the first who sounded this protest.l8 He blames all those who enumerated the precepts, and points out that there are two kinds of precepts: those that were enjoined for ever 14 See Kebusat Hakamim, p. 58. 15 Mp1 ylWtiK r^5Di 5ns i D 5 9 m4Sy -n [x n :1] INZ -nI 365:w on:W n,Srin (Commentary on Deut. 30. 2, ed.

Now if the former alone are counted, they would not amount to the required number, while if we also include the latter, they would exceed that number.19 Ibn Ezra20 deals at length with this question, and employs logical arguments against all systems. His criticism is chiefly levelled at the liturgic writers. He likens them to a man who counts the number of herbs that are mentioned in a book on medicine, without knowing their use.21 It is noteworthy that the objection came from writers who were not specialists in Halakah. For although Ibn Bal'fm cultivated the study of Halakah in his old age, he can hardly be regarded as a specialist in that branch. Moses ibn Ezra in his Kitdb al-Muhddarah wal-Mzddkarah, while speaking of the Jewish scholars in Spain, says of Ibn Bal'am: ,nn i3 nm 'l rlpnDK, who studied Halakah during the latter part of his life,22 but does not style him a Halakist. The only Halakist who was undecided on this matter is Nahmanides-that complex soul combining rationalism and mysticism-who expressed his doubts whether the Talmud meant this number to be taken seriously.23 But even he, in spite of the difficulties he points out, is inclined to follow the majority. All other authorities have allowed this number to remain as a sort of dogma. 19 See passage in extenso, loc. cit. 20 Yesod Mird, chapter II. 21 n2W=11 liDD M1= CID1 tDNW Qoni-i nlnnltfn 9n:l .nxlm rn in n = nn nr = v S Kl.6 oiln nbMon D n3 D21.n17 (towards the end of chapter II). 2 I take this quotation from Derenbourg, Gloses d'Abou Zakariya Yahia ben Bilam sur Isaie, p. 7. 2s See his nlWrl to Maimonides's Sefer ha-Miswot, at the beginning. 526</page><page sequence="9">HEFES B. YASLIAH'S BOOK OF PRECEPTS-HALPER 527 II HEFES B. YASLIAH It is the fate of a good many Jewish writers that little or nothing of their lives and activities is known. Jews have always allowed books to supersede their authors. Even in the Bible, where every letter was scanned, many of the writers are not known by name, and it is only when an author accidentally revealed his personality that we know anything about him. This is perhaps to be accounted for by the nation's conception of inspiration. For only canonical books were preserved, and in such books the author is merely the vehicle of the word of God. Wellhausen somewhere accuses the Jews of ingratitude, because they failed to perpetuate the memory of the Maccabaean heroes, and excluded from the Canon the books that relate their triumphs. But this again is in harmony with the Jewish conception. The Maccabees were the tools of the Almighty, and as such they deserved no credit, since God merely chose them to carry out His will, just as in former years He had chosen Assyria to punish His people. It is, therefore, not to be marvelled at that Hefes b. Yasliah, whose books were for centuries lost sight of, is nothing more than a mere name. Early Jewish historical works, like Abraham ibn Daud's Seder ha-.Kabbalah and Abraham Zakuta's Yuhtasin, pass him over in silence. The honour of having drawn the attention of scholars to the existence of this wonderful personality is due to Zunz. As early as 1832 he mentioned the name of Hefes among the rational interpreters of the Bible in his Gottesdienstliche</page><page sequence="10">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Vortrdge, p. 397. Ten years later he gave a brief sketch of this scholar in a note to Haarbriicker's Specimen of Tanzhum Yerushalmi's Commentary on Yudges. For in his note on Judges 2o. 28, Tanh.um quotes the Book of Precepts of Hefes. Haarbrucker did not know the existence of such a writer, and he applied to Zunz for information.24 When Rapoport wrote the biography of R. Hanan'el in 1830, he discussed in note 36 the authorship of the halakic work Sefer Iefes, which was up till that time ascribed by most writers to that famous scholar of Kairuwan. Rapoport, however, found a number of difficulties, for some decisions quoted from the Sefer .Hefes are opposed to those that occur in the authenticated works of R. Hanan'el. Furthermore, in some passages both R. Hanan'el and the Sefer .Hefes are quoted, which makes it improbable to consider that scholar as its author. To overcome these difficulties,Rapoport made a sort of compromise: R..Hanan'el was the author of that book, but his disciples added some decisions and altered others. In consequence of the suggestions thrown out by Zunz, scholars occasionally wrote about Hefes. Fiirst was, I believe, the first to connect Hefes b. Yasliah with the Sefer .efefs. In his Literaturblatt des Orients he gave two brief notices of HIefes.25 Using the sources indicated by Zunz, he added two important observations, and one of them is the identification of the Sefer Hefes with the Book of Precepts. The other observation related to the place of residence of that author. For Zunz assumed that Hefes had lived in Kairuwan, whereas First suggested Babylon as Hefes's place of residence. Neither Zunz nor First had any valid reasons for their assumptions which they expressed 24 See pp. x, xi and 53, 54. 25 Vol. X, pp. IIo and 247. 528</page><page sequence="11">HEFE. B. YASLIAH'S BOOK OF PRECEPTS-HALPER 529 with hesitation; but, as we shall see later on, a recent discovery proved the latter to be right. Two years later Reifmann published a short note in the same periodical, and without referring to any writer, identified the Sefer .Hefes with the Book of Precepts.26 About I860 Rapoport wrote three articles on Hefes b. Yasliah which he sent to Stern. One of these articles, evidently the most complete, was published in Kebusat Hakamim.27 There the view is expressed that Hefes lived in Palestine, or rather in Jerusalem. No reference whatsoever is made to Zunz. The Sefer .efes is with great ingenuity and thoroughness ascribed to Hefes. One of the other articles subsequently came into the hands of Halberstam who published it in Kobak's Yeshurun.2 In that article Rapoport refutes the view of Zunz about Hefes's place of residence, and adduces proofs that Palestine was the home of that Halakist. Other scholars who wrote a more or less complete biography of Hefes are Steinschneider,29 Ginzberg,30 and Poznaniski.:3 All that could be gathered with certainty at that time was that Hefes was blind,32 and was styled by various writers Gaon,33 Resh Kalla,34 Alluf,33 and Rosh Yeshibah.36 2C Vol. XII (1851), p. 617.

In the absence of positive facts, imagination was allowed to roam unbridled. To the various opinions mentioned above should be added that of Poznaiski who suggested that Hefes might have been a native of Spain, since the earliest writers who quote him belong to that country.37 Fortunately, however, among the Genizah fragments at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America there is a letter which settles this question. The writer of that letter remarks: rj)pt' t: ,nt t2n n 'niN ,3 ninni) 5)D mvWniv n^5r p 9s1 ytn ntnS nsr,n znn Drnn. We thus know that Hefes lived in Mosul, which Jewish writers called i'WI. There certainly can be no reason for doubting the accuracy of this remark, as the writer of this letter seems to be well informed, and is very careful in placing the title Alluf immediately after yDn in order to avoid the possibility of taking Yasliah to be the bearer of that title. As to the time when Hefes flourished, we are less fortunately situated, and some uncertainty still exists. It is usually assumed that he lived towards the end of the tenth century. But despite the consensus of opinion on this point, there is no basis for this conjecture, for it rests on assumptions which proved to be incorrect. No positive evidence was adduced for this view. Zunz hesitatingly suggests that Hefes is identical with the Alluf to whom reference is made by R. Hai Gaon in a Responsum. " In that Responsum it is stated that R. Hai had some 87 ilKip VJN, p. 25. 88 See JQR., New Series, I, p. 439. Professor A.

Hai.41 But there was not the slightest justification for that identification, and it is more likely that the Alluf referred to is Jacob b. Nissim.42 Scholars also attempted to fix the termninus a quo by the circumstance that Ibn Janah is the earliest writer who quotes Hefes.43 This is indeed a 'broken reed', for there probably was no occasion to quote him. If such an argument should be regarded as valid, we could place many an early writer at a late period. To mention only one glaring example. Nisi al-Nahrwani-an older con- temporary of Sa'adya-who must have been a prolific hymn-writer44 and scholar of high attainments, is only known from Nathan ha-Babli's report. When we consider the fact that many a scholar of past generations would have been doomed to oblivion, had it not been for some casual mention, it is impossible to lay stress on such an argument. Moreover, few books dating from the ninth and tenth centuries have been preserved, and, on the whole, writers of that period were not accustomed to quote their predecessors to a great extent. The talmudic and midrashic literatures alone were binding to them, whereas post- talmudic scholars had not yet acquired indisputable authority. From the references to Hefes nothing positive can be gleaned. He is grouped together with other writers in 40 3: nlnt1, 119. 41 Arabische Literaturder Juden, ? 62.

Thus Ibn Janah mentions some of the reliable interpreters of the Bible in the following order: Sa'adya, Sherira, Hai, Samuel b. HIofni, Hefes.45 That no stress can be laid on this order as regards chronology is evident from the fact that Hai is mentioned before Samuel b. Hofni. Then on the other hand Isaac ibn Gayyat places HIefes before Sa'adya.4" Also in a Genizah fragment, which is now at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, Hefes is casually mentioned before SaCadya and Samuel b. Hofni. It is a remarkable fragment, written in fluent rhymed prose, and seems to be a description of a trial before a judge. The writer was probably a copyist or bookseller by profession. The passage referring to the Geonim runs as follows:47 [yr]n n'': r: }n t [tp]r , -tl *;1 .981Dn jPn4 mD1 t-D mi iT K ,nii ) 1iw Nn313 nr[n]* KNi nwnM: 1n1 ng m:t n113V 'MI [wNr lnnl nv=l n ib tz WQ t nm nrh5in ,nti. That Hefes b. Yasliah is here meant cannot be reasonably doubted. For there is only one other writer bearing that name whose identity has not yet been established. He was a philosopher and is quoted by Ibn Gabirol.48 His full name was Hefes b. al-Birr al-Futi or al-Kuti, and it was suggested that al-Birr is an Arabic translation of the Hebrew n5x or vice versa.49 However this may be, the writer of the fragment obviously speaks of Halakists, and it is interesting to note that Hefes is classed among the most prolific writers of that period.

Unfortunately there hardly exists any internal evidence, as no post-talmudic writers are cited in the Book of Precepts. Discussions of a polemical nature, with the exception of one passage which will be explained later on,50 are entirely absent. Yet there is one point which deserves a full discussion. Hefes gives in every precept a rdsumd in Arabic of the pentateuchal law, and then quotes the verses in Hebrew. The Arabic words he employs are, with rare exceptions, identical with those of Sa'adya's translation. Even the constructions resemble those of Sa'adya, and the deviations are such as one may expect to occur in a rdsumd as distinct from a literal translation. In order to illustrate this point I shall place in parallel columns Sa'adya's translation and the rdsumd given by jHefes of the first four precepts that are preserved.

YASLIAH'S BOOK OF PRECEPTS-HALPER 535 It will be observed that the differences in the passages from Exodus are more numerous than in the one from Leviticus. This is to be accounted for by the fact that the former are less technical. Moreover, some differences are only apparent. Thus Sa'adya renders Ji indifferently by m: and n:m . In the passage quoted above Hefes has only the latter; but on the same page he also employs the former. There is no need to quote any further passages, but it may be stated that the Leviticus passage represents the relation between the two renderings more correctly. Now the differences in the Leviticus passage are so insignificant that they may be expected to occur almost in two different manuscripts of one and the same book. The two manuscripts of Sa'adya's translation of and commentary on Job, for instance, differ from each other to a very great extent.51 The same is the case with Bahya b. Pakuida's al-Hidaya ild Fard'id al-Kulub.62 In some places the Book of Precepts may help us to correct Sa'adya's text. Thus :Nb (Lev. 4. 13) is hardly an accurate rendering of tmy, and it seems quite probable that it is a scribal error for ':, as Hefes has it. The rendering of in by nm is very interesting. Although Hefes in the above passage has rin, in other places he agrees with Sa'adya in using nm .53 Now the ordinary word in Arabic for steer isj), or .oj )f, whereas ? is an extremely rare word, and in Mohammedan works its usual signification is hog.

The resemblance of these two versions will appear still more striking when we compare them with the independent translation of the Bible printed in Beyrout.

In this version almost every technical expression is ren- dered differently from the other two, and this would lead one to assume an interdependence of the latter. As Sa'adya is by far the better known of the two as a translator and commentator of the Bible, it seems at first sight reasonable to conclude that Hefes borrowed from him. This, accord- ingly, would fix the terminus a quo, and would indeed place Hefes in the second half of the tenth century, for we must allow some time for Sa'adya's translation to become universally spread. On reflection, however, this can hardly be considered conclusive evidence. To begin with, the fact that Sa'adya is the most renowned and admired Jewish writer of the 536</page><page sequence="19">HEFES B. YASLIAH'S BOOK OF PRECEPTS-HALPER 537 tenth century does not preclude the possibility of an earlier, though less satisfactory, attempt at translating the Bible, at least the Pentateuch, into Arabic. IHefes displays a thorough mastery of Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic. He shows great skill and a sense of appropriateness in choosing Arabic equivalents for the most obscure talmudic terms. Even in cases where his explanations lack philo- logical soundness, the Arabic words he uses admirably convey the meaning he intended. And in this branch he has no predecessors known to us. Is it at all likely that a man of the calibre of Hefes would need to borrow from the translation of another writer without due acknowledge- ment? It, therefore, seems natural to reject the theory that the translation of Hefes is influenced by that of Sa'adya. The striking resemblance of the two translations may be accounted for in a simpler manner. Although we have no data for determining exactly the time when Jews in Babylon adopted Arabic as their vernacular,64 there can be no doubt that this event took place centuries before Sa'adya. The Jews, accordingly, while studying the Bible, especially the Pentateuch, must have translated it into that language. Some sort of terminology must have gradually developed, and remained fixed to a considerable extent, especially in the case of technical terms. This terminology inevitably had some Hebrew colouring, otherwise such words as ax-o for burnt-offering, which is a literal translation of nlty,55 and a^L for peace-offering, Hebrew nDn't, could not have arisen. Accordingly, if Sa'adya really was the first translator of the Pentateuch, he merely committed to writing that which had been known orally, and it is only 54 Comp. Steinschneider, Arabische Literatur der Juden, p. xvii. 55 See Freytag's Lexicon, s. v. *.xo. P p X</page><page sequence="20">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEWV for the literary touches that he deserves credit, not for the actual translation. Subsequent writers, who had Sa'adya's translation before them, were no longer aware of the oral terminology that had previously existed, and unduly praised him for his work. For it must be borne in mind that a translation of the Bible made by Jews in their vernacular differs radically from that made by non-Jews. The former are enjoined to 'meditate therein day and night', and as soon as they adopt a new mother-tongue, are bound to find equivalents for Hebrew words. Thus the adoption of the new mother-tongue practically coincides with the translation which may be regarded as raw material for subsequent literary attempts. The first non-Jew, however, who wished to translate the Bible, had to begin with a clean slate, and was obliged to coin new terms. These considerations, to my mind, completely destroy the evidence to be adduced from the expressions Hefes employs in translating pentateuchal verses. In this connexion it is convenient to discuss two passages in which Hefes is supposed to quote Sa'adya explicitly, and which would thus conclusively prove that Hefes flourished after that famous Gaon. In 7QR., VI, p. 705, Neubauer published an Arabic fragment which he hesitatingly suggested to be part of the Book of Precepts by IHefes b. Yasliah. That fragment begins with a slightly abridged quotation from Menahot, Mishnah, 3, 6. 7.50 Then comes the following passage: nmnnie D Nrn ,DDp Ipl rnr3u ;nIm Mop #i6 nnrl,nwR , niv-i s'b 17i,7 r,h$NS snm wsh aS$ n'n tVr,n ilw$ tgrm:n tm s in is3 nr5N 1-i1s n m53 myn3-n ?nwn Tn b K:5 13n in ,wi "nK bDmI nlni Yrw Mn.

The passage that follows deals with an important principle for enumerating precepts. The gap must have been considerable, for we have to allow room for at least four or five sections.67 Another fragment which enumerated the first eight sections of Sa'adya's Reshut was published by Prof. Schechter.58 That fragment is headed 4tq mwne, nDnn ,nn 59 g nlynt im QDp n) wi 4DIN3m nrmo mnn rshn 6n iy 5t ,sn a p1Kw [D W :D lnDMnn:v J NDp. The remaining lines are, with the exception of a few insignificant variants, identical with those of Neubauer's fragment, and hence Prof. Alexander Marx was led to consider Samuel b. Hofni the author of the latter.60 There is, however, no ground for this identification. That the two fragments do not belong to one and the same book is self-evident. In Saadyana we have the beginning of Samuel b. Hofni's commentary, whereas in Neubauer's fragment we have a direct quotation from Sa'adya's Reshut before it was translated into Arabic. Since the headings alone are quoted, there is no room for divergency in style, and there is nothing to connect the two writers. One feels inclined to agree with Neubauer that 'it is certainly not by Samuel ben Hofni'.61 On the other hand, I am now in a position to demonstrate 57 There are a few misprints in that passage, and Neubauer, JQR., VII, p. 172, corrected them in the name of Bacher, who had seen the manuscript. One important word, however, was left uncorrected. 5LtR, p. 707, 1. 14, ought obviously to be plUN or rln. 58 JQR., XIV, p. 2II; Saadyana, p. 53. 59 It seems to me that fil is the more correct reading, as a slightly obliterated il might easily be mistaken for 1. 6V) Ginzberg's Geonica, I, p. 179, note. 61 JQR., VII, p. 172.</page><page sequence="22">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW with certainty that Hefes was not the author of that fragment, and the evidence is furnished by the preserved portion of his Book of Precepts.

Matters of style are always subject to doubt, and those who are loath to rely on them will find convincing proof for my contention in the following consideration. The author of Neubauer's fragment refutes the system of a certain . .

YASLIAH'S BOOK OF PRECEPTS-HALPER 541 * . . *~~~~~~~~~~4 The Hebrew quotation is no doubt part of Azharot or Reshut. We have four lines rhyming with tn. The style is paitanic, and I think that the last word ni stands for ;l, just as 5i is the apocopated form of n.:. The Arabic is slightly clumsy, but my interpretation is the only one possible, for it would not do to take sKriN RVnw as the complement of ;R, since there would then be no apodosis. Moreover, the finite verb after I:3 (for there is no ground to read p pSt:) precludes such an alternative. Accordingly Bar Furkan lays it down as a principle that opposites are only to be counted as one precept. The writer of that fragment refutes this principle from a logical standpoint. Maimonides, too, agrees with the latter, for he consistently counts such cases as two precepts.65 The permission to eat clean animals is positive precept I49,06 and the prohibition against unclean animals is negative precept I72.67 Now Hefes b. Yasliah, as will be explained later on at the end of Chapter IV, is not at all aware of this subtle distinction. He usually reckons such cases as one precept, but sometimes as two. Thus, that a Nazarite must grow his hair is given as a positive precept, but the fact that he must not cut his hair is not given separately. On the other hand, he counts separately the commandment to bring all sacrifices to the special place (Deut. I2. 6) and the prohibition against eating any sacrifice outside that place (ibid., 12. 17). The reason why he counts them separately is because they occur in different passages of the Pentateuch. The other passage in which Hefes apparently quotes Sa'adya is the glossary to nnmp,n inDw published by Horowitz.68 The passage is headed nrwnn3 i6atS PDn 65 Sefer ha-Miswot, principle 6, ed.

The note on ml:n runs as follows: nnin :nnr n1- 0p n:l :mni 3n3ri?K. It is, however, easy to prove that the explanation attributed to Sa'adya does not form part of Hefes's glossary. For it is impossible that Hefes should quote an opinion different from his own without refuting or accepting it. Moreover, if he wanted to give ex- planations by Sa'adya differing from his own, he had occasion to do so in the next word. Hefes translates nSxp by n2I3, while Sa'adya, according to Solomon Parhon,69 renders it by zDp. Then in this very passage Hefes quotes a talmudic statement on ~nx which is against his own explanation. This statement is placed at the end of the passage, after all the difficult words have been explained. It is thus evident that Hefes did not interrupt himself in the middle, otherwise he would have placed the talmudic statement immediately after his translation of 4n, especially as this word occurs before nx:rn. It is also to be observed that Sa'adya does not translate m15n by 25nr. The text of his translation of Exod. 30. 34 has :tn5, while Derenbourg gives a variant fiim. We thus see that this note in the glossary to mnnrpn mnin is spurious. The copyist did not have the Book of Precepts before him, but excerpted the passage from Ibn Bal'am's Kitab al-Tarjzi.70 To any one who studies Ibn Bal'im's works it is inconceivable that he should have incorporated the entire passage from Hefes 69 MaC,beret he-'Aruk, s. v.

He usually quotes various opinions side by side. What really happened was this: Ibn Bal'am gave various opinions among which those of Hefes were prominent, and the copyist subsequently collected all of Hefes's explanations under the heading yj.n n~ ,. . ?Dan. He was, however, unable, in some cases, to differentiate between the words of Hefes and the comments of Ibn Bal'am. It is also possible that that spurious explanation of Sa'adya was added by the ' redactor' himself, who obviously was not well informed. The result of all these discussions appears convincing enough to enable us to state that for determining the time when Hefes flourished we only have a terminus ad quem- he was dead in the first half of the eleventh century, since Ibn Janah, when quoting him, adds the formula ,im% ,nznm -but the terminus a quo must be left open, until further evidence is brought to light. Vague and unfounded assumptions are of no avail. Out of the four titles, Resh Kalla, Alluf, Rosh Yeshibah, and Gaon, that are bestowed upon Hefes by writers who refer to him, the first is the one that was actually borne by him. This conjecture of Rapoport's 71 is strikingly confirmed by our fragment in which he styles himself twice as ~5= Ds.172 That Hefes was no Gaon in the technical sense needs no demonstration. In Sherira's Epistle, where a practically complete list of the Geonim of Pumbedita and Sura is given, no mention of this scholar is made. Writers subsequent to the gaonic period gave this term a wider denotation, and applied it almost to any great Talmudist. Thus Nissim b. Jacob of Kairuwan is also dignified with 71 Kobak's Yeshurun, VIII, p. 58. 72 See text, fols. 8 b, 25 a.</page><page sequence="26">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW that title. Indeed Sherira himself does not always keep to the technical sense, and some of the Amoraim are styled by him as Geonim.73 Nothing definite, however, is known of the functions of the Resh Kalla. It is usually considered synonymous with the title Alluf,74 which is also obscure. The prevalent view among Jewish scholars is that he was third in rank to the Gaon. This is based upon the report of Nathan ha-Babli,75 and there can be no doubt that within the constitution of the Babylonian Academies this was actually the case. But there is sufficient evidence for the assumption that the term Resh Kalla was used in two different senses. Here again Rapoport's ingenious conjectures help to clear up many difficulties.70 He drew attention to the prayer tp13 aip' in which the Reshe Kalla are mentioned before the exilarchs and the heads of the academies. For it is hard to get reconciled to the idea that the titles are enumerated at random. He accordingly concludes that this prayer was composed in Palestine where the Resh Kalla was the highest dignitary.

The same scholar gave plausible reasons for his hypothesis 73 See Neubauer, Mediaeval Jewish Chronicles, I, pp. 31, 32. 74 Rapoport, toc. cit., is undecided on this matter, but Poznafiski is of the opinion that the terms are identical.

YASLIAH'S BOOK OF PRECEPTS-HALPER 545 that originally the head of the Academy at Pumbedita was styled Resh Kalla, not Gaon.78 Then there is a talmudic passage which tends to prove that the Resh Kalla was higher in rank than the Rosh Yeshibah during the amoraic period. It is stated in Berakot 57a that if one enters a shrubbery in his dream it is a sign that he will become a Rosh Yeshibah, while if he enters a forest he will become 'head of the sons of the Kalla'. Now as a forest is larger than a shrubbery, one is inclined to think that a Resh Kalla was more important than a Rosh Yeshibah.7' At all events it seems safe to assume that some Reshe Kalla were heads of independent academies, and owed no allegiance to the Gaon. This accounts for the fact that some scholars outside the gaonic academies bore the title Resh Kalla. There would then be no need to assume, in some cases at least, that this title was conferred by the Gaon upon foreign scholars as a mark of respect. That Hefes belonged to this class of Reshe Kalla seems to be clear from the fact that he is styled Rosh Yeshibah by Solomon Parhon.80 Moreover, the Resh Kalla in the gaonic academy would hardly have ventured to write a comprehensive work on Halakah. We know that they were not even allowed to answer Responsa.81 78 Op. cit., pp. 46-50. 79 Rashi, who evidently knew that the Resh Kalla was inferior in rank to the Rosh Yeshibah, explains the passage in the following manner: a shrubbery which consists of big and small trees, and is dense, is a sign for a Rosh Yeshibah, for young and old gather together to listen to his lectures; while a forest which consists of big trees not close to one another is a sign for the head of the pupils, that is to say, the Resh Kalla who explains to the pupils the subject expounded by the teacher. This com- parison is, however, too forced. 80 See above, note 3a. 81 See Ginzberg, Geonica, I, p. 8.</page><page sequence="28">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW It should be noted that the meaning 'zn has not been satisfactorily explained. It is usual to vocalize it 5_S, and in deference to custom I transliterate it accordingly. But it seems doubtful whether it yields a suitable meaning. To take it to denote crown seems unlikely for various reasons. To begin with, a crown in Aramaic is usually HKm5N, not t53. Then even if we connect it with the crown of the law, the sense is still obscure. Rapoport takes it to signify a lecture,s2 but does not explain the etymology. The most plausible suggestion appears to me to vocalize it KS?, and assign to it the signification of assembly, gathering. A striking parallel is found in Arabic sL4and ax-ot, both of which denote academy, university. As a writer Hefes is only known by his Book of Precepts. All quotations hitherto found can be traced to that book which was a storehouse of Halakah, philology, and philosophy as it was understood in those days. First and foremost he was a Halakist, and it is chiefly in this branch of Jewish learning that his interests were centred. Philology and philosophy claimed his attention only so far as they had any bearing upon Halakah. His book was the standard work on Halakah in Bahya b. Pakiida's days. For in enumerating the various authoritative books in all branches, Bahya names the Book of Precepts by Hefes b. Yasliah which gave a brief account of all laws as compared with the Halakot Gedolot which contained only those that are obligatory at this time.83 It is always quoted with the 82 Jeshurun, VIII, p. 63. 83 rmn i ^b.&lt;JS^ 4^ \ \ ^\J\ ^j. ^ \W * ?J j ni^m, nnplD: nm^n J- .:j,\ I1s j ffi LjlJ L j\w nmisF P nlSvn (Duties of the Heart, ed.

There can be no doubt that had the author written this book in Hebrew, the references to it would have been more numerous. As it is, the author was lost sight of with the disappearance of the knowledge of Halakah in Arabic-speaking countries. The few references to R. Hefes that occur in books by writers who did not know Arabic are borrowed from other sources.84 Not being satisfied with a mere enumeration of the precepts, as was done by the author of the Halakot Gedolot, and, centuries later, by Maimonides, he gives a lengthy discussion of each detail. In the ethical precepts he had occasion to expound his philosophical speculations which show him to be a clear thinker, well versed in the philo- sophical doctrines of his times. Whenever he quoted an obscure passage from the Bible or rabbinic literature he appended to it a commentary which is remarkable for its precision. There is sufficient testimony that he was dis- tinguished in all these branches. As a rational commentator of the Bible he is quoted by grammarians, lexicographers, and commentators like Ibn Janah, Ibn Bal'am, Solomon Parhon, and Tanhum Yerushalmi. Here, too, as in the case of Halakah, his opinions command the greatest respect, and are usually adopted.85 Even the ill-tempered Ibn Bal'am who had no regard for authorities 8 is glad to find in Hefes 84 Thus Piske Recanate, 38 b, is a direct quotation from Alfasi's Responsa, o19. 85 Solomon Parhon in his Malhberet he-'Aruk, s. v. pP, adopts the interpretation of Ijefes against Sa'adya's. 86 See Moses ibn Ezra, al-Muhiddarah wal-Mudakarah, quoted by Derenbourg, Gloses d'Abou Zakariya Yahia ben Bilam sur IsaTe, p. 7, and Fuchs, Studien, p. 23. nl 1n tn( SID1' , Nobody escaped his attacks (lit. his net).</page><page sequence="30">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW support for his view.87 Naturally -Iefes did not entirely escape the severe criticism of Ibn Bal'am who in his com- mentary on Deut. 30. 2 blames him for having counted that verse as a precept and for interpreting R. Simlai's statement literally. And if writers on the Bible are greatly indebted to Hefes, there can be no doubt that he laid under still greater obligation early lexicographers and interpreters of the Mishnah and Gemara. His influence upon Maimonides is evident from the remarks of the latter in Pe'er ha-Dor, I40, 142, that his errors in certain matters are due to his having followed R. Hefes. Some of the philosophic doctrines of Hefes have fortunately been preserved for us by Judah b. Barzillai, a writer of the twelfth century. In his commentary on the Book of Creation, whose value lies more in the lengthy quotations from books no longer extant than in the author's own views, he gives at length the first two precepts of Hefes's Book. This passage is an important contribution to mediaeval Jewish philosophy. In order to appraise Hefes as a philosopher it may not be out of place to reprint the entire passage here, and translate it into English. This is also rendered necessary by the fact that the printed edition is not free from errors. Halberstam who edited the text did not see the manuscript.

Halberstam emends it to 15^niw, which does not suit the context. My emendation is quite obvious: D was misread as :, and the word was therefore divided into two. D'1Il may perhaps be read as t31t1, but 'l1:111 is more suitable, and the corruption may be accounted for by the fact that 14 written in a cursive hand may be easily misread as D. What Hefes wrote in Arabic was no doubt nj lwp nr mli K 1DS -nn I- Ip ;i DJi"y. The idea expressed is that all rational beings know that He is the true God, they only differ as to His names and sayings. This is a thought often met with in mediaeval Jewish philosophy, and its origin is in Menalhot IIo a, where this very verse is cited. 99 Malachi i. I . 100 This word is missing in the text. As it is the method of Hefes in this passage, as well as in the fragment of the original, to explain each word and phrase, there can be no doubt that he elucidates the phrase I3y I'M of the Deut. verse, and that it has no connexion with the preceding. Hence it is necessary to supply some such word as #1it. IHefes wrote ?1p, and had one of the Ibn Tibbons translated it he would have put ?i31. But our translator lived before that period in which it was considered fashionable to imitate the Arabic idioms and constructions, and he therefore rendered that word by t'1=3 tO1, or perhaps by 'InE' 1*1. 101 The printed edition has [N1, which is obviously an error. 102 Pirke Abot, 2. 14. 550</page><page sequence="33">IIEFES B.

The words know therefore this day imply: while thou art yet alive; for after a man's death his knowledge will not avail him, and he will not be able to repair the error which he committed during his life. And the words, and lay it to thy heart, imply that thou shouldst lay this matter to thy mind and the vision of thy heart, as it is written: And I applied my heart to seek and to search ont by wisdom. The proof that laying a thing to one's heart makes one understand it is to be found in the words of the prophet, who says concerning a man who does not set his heart to differentiate between the essential and the unessential: He calleth not to mnind, neither is there knowledge or zunderstanding to say, 12s See note I03. 124 Deut. 32. 39. 125 Isa. 40. 28. Qq 2</page><page sequence="36">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW / have burnedt half of it i the fire. And the meaning of the words, that the Lord (rnin) He is God, is that He is existent in truth, for the word 1in denotes something that exists. And the name W,nS signifies something fundamental, for He is flndamental, and He is everything; as it is written: In the be6ginning Elolhim created. He was only named rIn,i after man and the universe were created. The word n:,n1 explicitly states that He is Master and Lord of all. Seest thou not that the word nrn, explicitly states that He is Master of all created things ? Nor can any one be proclaimed Lord until the thing over which he is Lord becomes a fact; similarly no being can be established unless it has a master. But the name Elohim is funda- mental, and does not imply priority, or posteriority, or the existence of a created thing. The ancients say con- cerning the verse in the day when r,.SNK nili, made earth and heavent: He mentioned a complete name concerning a complete world. The words in heaven indicate all that is in heaven, stars and angels; for all worship Him, and believe in truth with all their power and understanding, as it is written: Aznd the heavens shall praise Thy wonders, also Thy belief in the assembly of the holy ones. For who in the skies can be compared unto the Lord? Who among the sons of the mighty is like unto the Lord? &amp;c. And the words, and upon the earth, signify that which is on earth, rational beings and animals; for it is evident from all things that He is the God of truth. All rational beings acknowledge this, and believe in that thing, although His names and words vary among them. For it is written: For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the sam e, My name is great amotng the Gentiles. And the words there is none else indicate that He is the only 554</page><page sequence="37">HEFES B. YASLIAH'S BOOK OF PRECEPTS--I1ALPER 555 one in truth, as I shall explain in this section. Our teachers of blessed memory said that a man should learn all proofs that might possibly occur to him that He is one, and there is no other, as it is said: Be diligent to learn the Law, so that thou imayest know what to answer a heretic. I am obliged to explain here this proof in order that one may be strengthened in the truth that He is one, and is the Creator of all things. Know that all things that exist and are known, vegetables and animals, are composed of four elements, which are earth, water, fire, and air: it is from them that they are created, and it is to them that they will return, and become effaced. This is known by true demonstration. The element in them is visible, and can be tested. Now since the element is visible and can be tested, for they are established and blended together, we know from our understanding that another creator moulded them, and they were not created of their own accord. For some of these elements may overpower the others, annihilate and destroy them, as, for instance, water extinguishes fire, and the wind dries up water; and similarly in other cases. Moreover, they decay and vanish. Similarly it is known that the spheres and stars were created by some one else, and were not created by them- selves. Now since we know by the understanding of our heart that everything has a creator and a founder, and that nothing is created by itself, it is clear and evident with truth and certainty that He who founded and created the world, who rules and guides it, is Master of everything without doubt or uncertainty. He is God alone to whom no image or likeness can be compared, as it is written: To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto Hilm ? And so did Moses our teacher say:</page><page sequence="38">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW And ye saw no form, only gye heard a voice. By these proofs it is established in our minds, and becomes manifest in our thoughts that God exists, and that we know of Him no form or likeness except the splendour of His glory; as it is written: And he beholds the form of the Lord. And that is the form of the splendour of His glory, and that which is approximately near His glory, though they do not resemble one another.-When we enter a house, although the builder who built it is not present, we know that undoubtedly a builder built it, as if we were present at the time of its construction. But if we try to conjure up in our mind the form and likeness of the builder, his stature, the colour of his hair, and other details, we would fail to accomplish it by mere belief. Now since we are unable to grasp, from his work, the details about a man who is like us, how much less can we conceive the likeness of the Creator of all things, blessed be His name! I give this proof in order that it may be fixed in our heart, and established in our mind with certainty, that the fact that a thing is made is evidence that there is a maker, as if we had seen him make it; and the intellect cannot deny the existence of the maker merely because he is not present, for this parable makes this idea clear to the mind. As it is written: Hast thou n ot known ? hast thou not heard? The everlastino God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is Lie weary, there is no searczhing of His understanding. 'The second precept enjoins us to consider the Creator as the only one, and to believe in our heart and thoughts that He, in truth and without any doubt, is one, and that there is no other besides Him. We must not attribute to Him any likeness or semblance of any corporeal thing 556</page><page sequence="39">HEFES B. YASLIAH'S BOOK OF PRECEPTS-HALPER 557 in the world, although such things occur in Scripture, as for instance, the eyes of the Lord, the hand of the Lord, the earth is My footstool, and many other similar cases. These expressions are only used in order to liken Him in accordance with human speech, as it is also written: The Lord hath sworn by His right hand and by the arm of His strength. It is also our duty to believe with truth and certainty that He is one in His essence and glory, without increase or decrease, without conjunction or division, without change or motion. But everything else besides Him increases and decreases; is divisible; becomes new and old; is joined and divided; has a beginning and an end; is subject to change; decays and is set firm. None of these things, however, apply to our Creator, whose memory is exalted, as it is written: Hear, 0 Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one. And he who desires to prove that there is no other besides Him at all, should investigate the law of singular and plural, of the number and the numbered. It will become evident that the plural is composed of units, as the ancients have taught. Now since 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. come after I, it is evident that I is without any doubt prior to any other number. It is also established that the plural contains I, and that I is prior to all the others, for after i we count the other numbers, and we only say 2, 3, &amp;c. after we said I. Now since the truth of the matter has been established that our Creator, whose name is exalted, is prior to anything that is first, we know that there is none like Him, that He has no second or anything similar. For those misguided people who declare that He has a second cannot be consistent with a perfect mind and say that He is one. Since it has been established that He is prior to anything that is first, it is manifest</page><page sequence="40">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW that He has no second. In consequence of all the reasons we have mentioned, it is inconceivable that the Creator of all things should have any of the qualities possessed by all other beings. For He is one in truth, and there is no other besides Him, as we have stated above. For anything that possesses a similitude, adjunct, divisibility, changeability, corporeality, and motion must necessarily be subject to increase and decrease, and must have a beginning and an end, and hence is not one at all. From all these proofs we know in truth and principle that our God is one, as it is written: See now that 1, even I, am He, and there is no God with Me; I kill and make alive; I wound and heal; and there is none that can deliver out of My hand. It is also written: Hast thou not known ? hast thou not heard? The everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is He weary, there is no searching of His understanding.' In this passage the kernel of mediaeval Jewish phi- losophy is contained, for it is practically on these lines that later Jewish philosophers proved the existence and unity of God. Kaufmann was certainly right in pointing out that Bahya followed Hrefes in proving the existence of God from the composition of the four elements.26 Here again 1Hefes meets with Sa'adya who treats of the same topic in the second chapter of al-Amdnat zal-I'tikdddt. They both explain the anthropomorphic expressions that occur in the Bible.127 The difference in temperament between these two writers is clearly marked. Sa'adya was always in a polemical vein, and consequently treated the 126 See Judah b. Barzillai, Commentary on the Sefer Yesiral, p. 335. 127 Comp. especially . J.jl.

YASLIAH'S BOOK OF PRECEPTS-HALPER 559 subject from all possible points of view, refuting actual and imaginary doctrines. He is never content to expound his own beliefs, but is always at pains to prove the un- tenability of any other opinion. Hefes, on the other hand, is calm and impassive. Nothing exists for him but his own convictions. His thoughts and ideas are simple and naive. He does not enter into intricate discussion, but gives illustrations from familiar objects. As his own con- victions are to him self-evident, there is no need to refute the doctrines of others. Grant his premisses, and his conclusions will follow quite naturally. Whether Hefes wrote any special treatise on philosophy is unknown. As such a book is nowhere mentioned, the assertion may be hazarded that he incorporated all his philosophical speculations in the Book of Precepts. Another book by IHefes is alluded to by himself in the Book of Precepts.128 This was a treatise on Quantities or Measures (\kiio, i.e. B'vlP). But only the intention of composing a book devoted to this subject is recorded there, and it is not known whether he carried out his resolution. It should be observed that the passage in question is slightly corrupt. It is as follows: Inn nrlmi' vK nTpwiS now n Do Nv 15' -P tK, i nSi n-Dia iwn 3DYnS$ n lnavi is :Nnn ND. tnvlyvwi. The explanations of these subjects are long; we abridge them, because we have in mind to treatatt full length of all the quantities in a book which we shall devote to this subject. The verb 5Iy is ambiguous, as it usually denotes he relied Iipon. Accordingly it would be reasonable to assume that the book had already been written. Dozy, however, gives also the meaning ofprendre rdsolution, and this suits most admirably the continuation 128 Fol. 9Ja, 1. i. See note to that passage.</page><page sequence="42">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW vna2. It is the latter word, which is imperfect, that forces the conclusion upon us that when Hefes wrote that remark the book on Quantities was not yet committed to writing. Whether it was ever written cannot be stated with certainty. It is nowhere else quoted, and in absence of any corrobora- tive evidence about the existence of such a work, this question must be left undecided. As to the glossary to the words of nnDpn orln (4Oabn nmpI n1n toI5~ 6 N)129 it can be stated with certainty that it never formed a separate work. It is a very brief commentary, and extends over half a page. It was the system of HIefes to give an explanation of the difficult words that occurred in the biblical or rabbinic passages that he quoted. Such 'commentaries' are found in our fragment.130 It is to the credit of Steinschneider that he recognized this commentary as an extract from the Book of Precepts.ll' This conjecture is now indisputably verified. It is unlikely that Hefes is the author of the glossary to the Halakot Gedolot (y'ni nrn f^jPm) which is mentioned in a Genizah fragment containing lists of Hebrew and Arabic books.132 We know that Hefes was no admirer of the author of that work. We have the testimony of Ibn Bal'am and Maimonides that HJefes severely criticized the method of the author of the Halakot Gedolot, and he would have had little reason to help to popularize that work, unless we assume that he wrote the glossary in the early part of his life, while he was still under the influence of that great codifier. 129 It has been printed in its entirety by Horowitz in nin,~ m:: n'r, II, pp. 63 ff. 130 See fols. 27 b and 29 a. 131 Arabische Literatur der Juden, ? 62. 132 See Poznafski, ijN'p IW., p. 27, note 2. 560</page><page sequence="43">HEFES B.

Freimann under the title mI,nrm, IHefes Alluf being given as the author.'13 This assumption rests on faulty, though ingenious, com- binations. The identity of the book itself cannot be established with certainty, and there is not a particle of evidence to justify any connexion with Hefes. There is accordingly no need to compare that book with the Book of Precepts in order to show the difference of method adopted in this work. Indeed, Freimann himself saw the weakness of his position, and in his preface to the second volume admits that his assumption is full of serious diffi- culties.l34 Nevertheless he allowed the name of Hefes to appear as the author. The statement of Freimann that Hefes lived after the author of the Midrash Hashkeml 13 rests on a misunderstanding of the passage from Samuel b. Jam"s nwn n mnn. Freimann had this passage in a Hebrew translation which was very vague. Samuel b. Jam"s words do not in the least connect Hefes with the author of that book.

The name nlywp? is accordingly an allusion to the talmudic passage in which it is stated that he who wishes to be wise should occupy himself with civil law, for there is no branch of the law greater than that.l39 There is apparently some support for this view in the fact that one of the quotations from the nlvMpDn rID actually occurs in the fragment of the Book of Precepts which has been preserved.

Meir of Rothenburg ascribes this opinion to the Geonim, Alfasi, Natronai, and Hefes.141 Rapoport, accord- ingly, might have ascribed the nryprIln Io to Natronai.l42 On the other hand the Sefer l.efes which is frequently quoted by French and German Halakists should be allowed to have Hefes as its author. Although none of the quota- tions from the Sefer Ilefes happens to be preserved in our fragment, and there is thus no evidence of a positive nature for this identification, there is no sufficient ground for rejecting this obvious connexion of Hliefes with that book. This Sefer .Hefes was in all probability the Book of Precepts which the Halakists who were not familiar with Arabic quoted second hand, and hence the name of the author was unknown to some of them.143 There is hardly any likeli- hood of that book having been translated in its entirety into Hebrew. For in that case its disappearance would have been strange indeed. Two objections have been raised against the identification of this book with the Book of Precepts, but on careful examination they will be found to have no weight. It has been remarked that the quotations from the Book of 141 Responsa, ed. Prague, 250. See Rapoport, op. cit., p. 56. 142 I cannot resist the temptation of putting down a suggestion which occurred to me, and might occur to some one else, though I am perfectly convinced it is utterly unfounded, and that is to consider the n1lYpDO '3D as a translation of the nInmpDK N :3nY3. The root Yy/p is sometimes synonymous with l3', which would be a good equivalent for )J3 in some of its significations. But, as in Hebrew, the technical term is 'l3rY, this suggestion cannot be seriously considered. 143 Abraham of Lunel, who quotes Ilefes in ln,iDI n, pp. 6i a and 67 a, took the passage from Isaac ibn Gayyat. Similarly, in Piskc Recanate, 386, it is explicitly stated that the quotation is borrowed from Alfasi. Comp. especially Judah b. Barzillai's quotation discussed above.</page><page sequence="46">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Precepts are of a different nature from those of the Sefer hefes.144 This is, however, not borne out by the data at our disposal. It can be safely asserted that all quotations from the Sefer .efes, with the exception of one or two which will be presently dealt with, may have easily formed part of the Book of Precepts. See especially the passage in Or Zarua', III, Piske Baba Kamma, 370, where the exact meaning of in,n is determined by biblical usage of that verb. This is the method of Hefes throughout his Book of Precepts. The other objection is based upon the fact that Hefes is supposed to be quoted in the Sefer Hefes. R. Moses of Coucy, in his Sefer Miswot Gadol, 14 says: 'yn ?::D rnnnnpn n'lln3 '/^ DnWt ;jX:iw ;p^5 y n arn ,T, 7t"y tn3 ;n= 'rnine ptrnm. If Hefes was the author of the Sefer Hefes, it is asked, how is it possible that he should mention his name in this manner? Rapoport, who anticipated this objection, suggests an ingenious, though hardly convincing, solution. Hefes, he says, was blind, and was therefore unable to write. His pupils, accordingly, wrote down what- ever he dictated to them, and subsequently added all the customs their teacher observed. As a mark of respect they called the book after their teacher, and dignified him with the title Gaon.14m The explanation, however, has failed to carry conviction, and scholars are still undecided. But a careful examination of the passage in Sefer Miswot Gadol will not only do away with the objection, but will enable us to use it as proof that Hefes was the author of the Sefer .Hefes. That R. Moses of Coucy does not quote the passage verbatim is evident from the fact that 144 See Poznanski, WT'lDp 4RK p. 28. 145 Positive precept 48, p. 127 b. 146 .Kebusat Hakamim, p. 56. 564</page><page sequence="47">HEFES B. YASLIAH'S BOOK OF PRECEPTS-HALPER 565 he does not state under what circumstances the marriage documents are to be brought. He only gives the mode of procedure, but does not say when this is to be done. Of course the circumstances are fully explained in the Sefer Miswot Gadol, and hence the reader sees to what it refers. Accordingly the quotation from the Sefer .fefes is not in oratio recta, but in oratio obliqua, and the original words were a,n1n pit. R. Moses of Coucy, wishing to avoid ambiguity, stated whose custom it was. For if he said inmn pi it might have been taken to mean that he himself was accustomed to do so. This hypothesis is not without foundation. For this practice in the case of a widow or divorced woman who lost her marriage document is given at full length by R. Meir of Rothenburg in the name of the Sefer Iefes, and is as follows: n:rrrw nri yrmnn sv: zn m IK fz IN1wa nmoin wK 1n:m nwmn;v 1K .niirm nnsmarn :wn p1i plnW:vm inr innlny: r D ni35 'N r,nrn:p 5 nmn=.:147 Here we have the same passage from the same book in oratio recta, but instead of the words ps yr'n mn nim nrn 'r, we simply have Jxnvn 3p. That the last two words were not added by R. Meir of Rothenburg 14 is evident from the omission of the sentence "IN P M 'an 'i n rnt'n 1. It thus becomes quite clear that R. Moses of Coucy, who seems to have been well informed, knew that Hefes was the author of the Sefer I.efes, otherwise he could not have amplified the words ainin t in the manner he did. Further support, though less conclusive, for this view is to be derived from the curious fact that a number of 47 Responsa, ed. Prague, 852. 148 Indeed, Mordekai on Ketubot IX, ? 234 (ed. Wilna), who quotes this very passage, omits these two words. But it is obvious that he borrowed the quotation from R. Meir of Rothenburg, and did riot know where it ended.</page><page sequence="48">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Halakists of the thirteenth century ascribed this book to R. Hanan'el.149 Rapoport conclusively demonstrated that a number of decisions quoted from the Sefer .Iefes are opposed to those found in R. Hanan'el's authenticated works. It was this consideration that led Rapoport to accept the suggestion of Reifmann, anticipated by Fiirst, that Hefes was the author of that book.150 Now this confusion of authors can only be accounted for if the real author of that book had the initials n'", which were intended to stand for rin In. But to some Halakists who were not familiar with Arabic this name was unknown, and they therefore took these letters to stand for ~ann i. Had not these letters been the initials of the real author, the con- fusion could hardly have arisen. We thus have three arguments in favour of the author- ship of Hefes: (I) The obvious connexion of the names; (2) the quotation in Sefer Miswot Gadol and Responsa of R. Meir of Rothenburg; (3) the wrong ascription to R. Hanan'el. On the other hand, no evidence whatsoever has been hitherto adduced against his authorship. There are, however, some quotations from the Sefer fefes which, to my mind, could scarcely have formed part of the Book of Precepts. Thus from the Or Zaruza it seems that the Sefer IHefes contained Responsa of Natronai and decisions of Paltoi and the Academies.151 Now I have often had the occasion to remark that Hefes never quotes post-talmudic authorities. Moreover, in some cases this work is called r9n oDo, and in others y,snn %3D. The latter occurs in the passage where Paltoi is quoted. I therefore 149 See Rapoport, R.

Yasliah's Book of Precepts was the first attempt to codify the talmudic laws in Arabic. Indeed it may claim priority in giving an exhaustive, though brief, account of all ordinances in a logical order in any language. He went beyond his pre- decessors by collecting all the precepts, and arranging them into groups.'64 Instead of arranging positive precepts in one group and negative ones in another, as is done by practically all writers, including Maimonides, he incor- porates all precepts, positive and negative, belonging to one category, in one book (5a). He then divides them into two or more sections according to their subject-matter. 152 Or Zarua', Baba kamma 370. 153 Ibid. 28i. 154 Rapoport (gebusatHakamim, p. 58) states that Hefes arranged the precepts without any order or logical division, but divided them into chapters in accordance with the punishments. That this is incorrect is easily seen from the preserved fragment as well as from the two precepts quoted by Judah b. Barzillai. The passage in Maimonides's Sefer ha-Miswot, p. 55, upon which Rapoport bases his assertion, does not in the least warrant such a conclusion, as will be seen below. VOL. IV. R r</page><page sequence="50">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW These sections are in their turn subdivided into positive and negative precepts. Where necessary, he assigns dif- ferent classes to precepts that are obligatory throughout all ages and countries, and to those that are only incumbent during the existence of the Temple, or only in Palestine. It was a monumental work, a code in the real sense of the word, and contained a good deal of material which from the strict point of view of the codifier might have been considered irrelevant. But as a theologian JITefes had to assign reasons for every precept. What other writers did in various treatises, he attempted to incorporate in one book. Our fragment, which consists of sixty-three closely written pages, comprises fifty complete precepts and parts of two others, that is to say, about fifty-one precepts. Although they greatly vary in extent, it will be readily granted that we have here a fair sample of the average length of a precept. We are thus justified in assuming that these sixty-three pages represent a little less than a twelfth part of the book, minus the introduction, so that the enumeration and discussion of the precepts occupied approximately eight hundred pages. Add to this the introduction, which must have been rather lengthy,155 and it is evident that the entire book contained something like a thousand pages. As we do not possess Hefes's introduction (J3^&lt;.) to this book we cannot state with certainty the reasons that induced him to compose the Book of Precepts. It is, how- ever, easy to see that his purpose was mainly halakic. Not being satisfied with the treatment of the subject in the Halakot Gedolot, which is incomplete, he determined to codify the ordinances in a more convenient manner. 1l5 See below. 568</page><page sequence="51">HEFES B. YASLIAH'S BOOK OF: PRECEPTS-HALPER 569 Furthermore, Arabic at that time practically supplanted Aramaic as the vernacular among the bulk of the Jews, and this book supplied a much-felt need. It could be used by the layman who did not care to enter into the minute discussions of the Talmud which was written in a dialect that few understood in those days; while even the profound talmudic scholar might profit by it, as it contained all the sources upon which the decisions were based. Zunz hesitatingly suggests that it may have been directed against Karaitic works of the same title that were written at that time.156 But the absence of any polemical allusion militates against this view. There is only one place where Hefes refutes the opinion of another scholar. This is in connexion with the age when a girl attains her majority.157 But as the dispute turns on the interpretation of the statement of Samuel nrn ,henw; m nrlnd nly p3 j K -::n3, it is obvious that the scholar whose view Hefes refuted was a Rabbanite. As to the structure of the Book of Precepts we know that it had a lengthy introduction (J.J) which, apart from defining the author's system and method, gave a survey of the principles underlying the biblical and talmudic ordi- nances. Hefes states 158 that in the introduction he explained and discussed all cases where option was allowed. It was in that part of the work that his strictures on the author of the Halakot Gedolot were expressed. Although neither Ibn Bal'am 159 nor Maimonides,'60 from whom we know that Hefes criticized the method of the Halakot Gedolot, 156 Haarbriicker's Specimen of Tanhum Yerushalmi, p. 54. 157 Text, fol. 22 b. 158 Fol.

For it is in the introduction to his Sefer ha-Miswot that Maimonides criticizes his predecessors. It is impossible to say exactly how many parts the book consisted of; but there were at least thirty-six of them, for the thirty-sixth part is quoted by Hefes himself."ll In his treatment of individual precepts he is quite methodical, though monotonous. He practically uses the same formula in every case. Positive precepts are introduced by :in or n~rn, while negative ones invariably begin with w,n, all of which verbs are either used impersonally or have n'iv as their subject. In a comparatively few words a rdsume of the biblical law is given. He then goes on to state the ramifications and amplifications added by the Rabbis. He always quotes the passage upon which his decisions are based, first giving the pentateuchal verses and then the rabbinic passages. In this respect he radically differs from Maimonides who does not reveal his sources. The entire range of tannaitic and amoraic literature is at the command of Hefes, and he makes ample use of both Talmudim and of all halakic Midrashim. He refers to the Tosefta, Sifra, Sifre, Sifre Zuta, and to both Mekiltas, all of which seem to be of equal authority to him. A curious instance may be given here. The Mishnah in Kelim 62 records a controversy between the schools of Hillel and Shammai concerning the defilement of bands used for wrapping up scrolls. Shammai's school maintain that such bands are subject to ritual defilement, no matter whether they are embroidered or not, whereas Hillel's school are of opinion that only those that are not embroidered are 161 See text, fol. r2 a, 1. i5. 162 28. 4. 570</page><page sequence="53">HEFES B.

Rabban Gamaliel adds his opinion that in both cases the bands cannot be defiled The Mishnah gives no decision on this matter, but the Tosefta explicitly states that the matter is to be decided in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Gamaliel.l63 Maimonides in his commentary on the Mishnah,164 and in his Code,105 disregarding or overlooking the Tosefta, rejects Rabban Gamaliel's view, and adopts that of Hillel's school, as is usually the case when the Hillelites and Shammaites disagree on a point of law. Hefes, however, decides in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Gamaliel, and quotes the passage from the Tosefta (without indicating the source, as is his custom) as his authority. With the scanty material at our disposal it is impossible to attempt a reconstruction of this work. Nevertheless from the quotation found in the works of other writers, and from the numerous allusions in the preserved frag- ment, we are able to glean a few details which give us some idea of the nature and contents of the other parts. The introduction has already been referred to above. The first book contained ethical precepts, as may be seen from the first two precepts quoted by Judah b. Barzillai. The numerous references to this book show that it was of considerable length. In it Hefes had the opportunity of giving utterance to his philosophical and theological specula- tions. This book also dealt with the relation of God to man, and hence some of the ordinances appertaining to first- fruits and heave-offerings were described there.166 For the same reason the ethical side of vows was discussed in that book, and a principle was laid down whereby to know 163 Tosefta Kelim, Baba batra 6, 4. 164 Ed.

It is as follows: mn6yl wn, ml fin n:3 :'n:3 IJ= ,tAil wtj i ^3 n nt1n Nny 3tr Im NS. Out of them are thirty-tzvo cases coz- cerning whicl He itformed us that He ewho is blessed and exalted will supervise their committal, inot we; all of them are explicitly stated.l70 Maimonides who explains this pas- sage says that the thirty-two cases are twenty-three persons who are punished with being cut off (n )), and nine who are put to death by God. We thus know that this book treated of certain transgressions and their punishments. It should, however, be observed that Maimonides does not mention IHefes by name in this passage.

Although that word happens to have that signification, it is more than doubtful whether it suits the context. Moreover, Maimonides explains the words jlairD Knl f3i in the following manner: ni13 t? il n1 ,; ,rt l I ntV, that He who is exalted explicitly stated that He would cut off one and put the other to death. Here again Ibn Tibbon has T.lY for I0Y. But where is the guarantee expressed ? or what need is there for a guarantee ?

Maimonides uses the expression [xn tQ m which is not elegant Arabic for the first book, and ought to be '1K~i ~StI. It is only in colloquial Arabic that one says awwal nauba = 'the first time', instead of annauba al-ila, or better still, al-marra al-uld. Is it not possible that Maimonides merely meant at the beginning of a book, as if he would have said [tm -: ' t ? 173 It is true that Ibn Tibbon who rendered it by w'IK,I n'Yw took the phrase in its colloquial sense; but then it is quite possible that the translator misunderstood the author. To the second book we have one allusion by Hefes himself. From it we learn that that book dealt with the acquisition of slaves and all the laws appertaining thereto.174 The third book, part of which is preserved, dealt with the laws of damages, and contained four sections.

Further on a detailed discussion of the precepts that are preserved in this fragment will be given. For the present I only wish to remark that it seems to me that precepts 3-8 and o, 1 of section 4 of this book do not belong here. All the other precepts deal with damages, while those just mentioned treat of sacrifices. Considering the numerous errors that crept into our copy such a sup- position is not precluded.175 Of course the reverse may just as well be the case, that is to say, it is possible that the precepts dealing with damages are misplaced here, while those treating of sacrifices are in their place. This alternative suggestion would find support in the fact that the immediately following book also deals with sacrifices. The fourth book treats of free-will offerings, vows, consecrations, and a few other priestly laws. It contains thirty-six precepts, which are divided into three sections according to their subjects. The fifth book is devoted to special kinds of ritual defilement resulting fiom coming into contact with dead bodies or creeping things. As the ramifications of these precepts are extremely vast, while only a few verses are devoted to them in the Pentateuch, each precept extends over considerable length. Fourteen pages are taken up by the first two precepts and a portion of the third. There are two references by Hefes to the sixth book, and from them we learn that it dealt with the tithes of corn, &amp;c.,'76 and the various kinds of blood.177 It is very 175 See, especially, text, fol. 8 a, 1. i . 176 ji) ^n N MTD nl: MnD5K (fol. 13 a, 1. i8). 177 .sDit ^a i1Jn &amp; n g5 w1 #np ZmE i ;IInD n55 Kw ;~ 5sN K.b NKn 5%N.

Tithes and blood would naturally be included under these headings. The tenth book dealt with various kinds of blemishes found in animals, according to an allusion to it by .Hefes.178 The fourteenth book is once referred to, and we learn that its theme was the firstlings of animals.179 From the reference to the second precept of the nine- teenth book it seems likely that that book dealt with various kinds of defilement. Hefes quotes a passage from tractate Nazir dealing with certain causes of defilement, and he then remarks: I shall explain this passage in the second precept of the nineteenth book.l8? The thirty-sixth book was similar to the tenth, and treated of blemishes that are found in human beings. According to the allusion to it this book was specially devoted to the elucidation of all the terms used for the various kinds of blemishes.'8l It will thus be seen that Hefes arranged the precepts in a logical order, but tried to follow the Bible as closely as possible. The ethical precepts take precedence of all others, for they are the mainstay of religion. These ordinances disposed of, the author at once takes up the laws in Exodus, which are followed by those of Leviticus. Keeping the logical arrangement in mind, he is obliged please God (fol. 26 b, 1. 7).

This is naturally unavoidable, as precepts of the same character are found scattered in two or more books of the Pentateuch. Thus the cardinal precepts of the fourth book of Hefes's work occur in Leviticus, for it is in that book that free-will offerings are first mentioned; but there are a few kinds of these offerings that are to be found in Numbers. Similarly in the case of vows. The laws appertaining to a Nazarite are to be included in this category, but they occur in the sixth chapter of Numbers, while other ordinances about vows occur in the thirtieth chapter of that book, and some are in Leviticus.
