<plain_text><page sequence="1">352 RELIGIOUS STUDIES W. D. Hudson. A Philosophical Approach to Religion. Pp. 200. (Macmillan, I974.) ?;4*95. This is a lucid, carefully-argued and honest piece of work; it systematically applies certain fairly stringent criteria of tenability to some of the funda mentals of religious belief, as we ordinarily understand it, and reaches the conclusion that, in relation to these criteria, such belief is in principle tenable. Religion, for Dr Hudson, is '. .. a logically distinct language-game con stituted by the concept of god' (p. 22)-in the sense that this concept 'deter mines what in religious belief constitutes (a) an explanation, and (b) an experience' (p. I6). (Analogies are drawn with the functions of the concept of a physical object in natural science or that of moral obligation in morality.) But, granted that such a language-game has been extensively played, is it about anything which objectively exists' (p. 24) ? With characteristic fairness and perceptiveness, Dr. Hudson examines and ultimately rejects various traditional arguments for the existence of God, and various modern attempts to avoid the need for such arguments. His own approach (pp. 97 if.) is to start from the systematic elusiveness of 'really exists'. Since, he argues, we have not, and cannot have, any absolute criterion of reality '. . . anyone who uses the word "real" can (logically) decide in accordance with what criterion he is using it.... Reality, in a final or absolute sense, is not some thing which we can discover. In the last analysis what we take to be "real" is a matter of choice' (p. 103 f.) And presumably we can, if we will, choose in such a way that God, however we understand the term, is among those things that really exist. In his later chapters, Dr Hudson endeavours (on the whole, I thiAk, successfully) to meet the 'challenge of secularisation' as presented by Bonhoeffer, Braithwaite, and others, and to defend the rationality of the 'religious language-game' in relation to various possible criteria of rationality. This final section contains what Dr Hudson frankly admits to be the most tentative and least convincing part of his work, the attempt (pp. i65 ff.) to answer the arguments of such thinkers as Professors Edwards and Hepburn that '. . . it does not make sense to say that a being without a physical body can act in the world or meet with men'. His difficulties here, and elsewhere, can, I think, be traced back to the major weakness of the whole book, namely the comparatively sketchy and superficial treatment of the concept of deity itself. This in turn may be partly due to his use of the concept of a language-game, illuminating as this undoubtedly is in many contexts. For the religious language-game (or rather loosely-connected set of games) as ordinarily played will almost inevitably embody a somewhat crude, anthropomorphic model of the divine-human relationship-e.g. one in which you are one person, I another</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 353 and God a third, in essentially the same (unanalysed) sense of 'person', and God's relationships with us more or less replicate ours with each other. To let our theological thinking be dominated by such a model-however understandable and in some contexts valuable-is rather like letting our astronomical thinking be dominated by such facts as that every day discourse allows expressions like 'sunrise' and 'sunset' and to this extent embodies a geocentric model of the solar system. And the work of those most pre occupied with God, the saints or the mystics, for example, shows clearly enough that few of them found the anthropomorphic model much more satisfactory than a modern astronomer finds the geocentric one. Even if we accept Dr Hudson's 'fundamental contention' that 'the concept of god, i.e. of some form of transcendent consciousness and agency, is constitutive of religion' (p. I 73) must we think of God as one conscious and active being among others of the same genus, distinguished by being unembodied and possessing a uniquely powerful consciousness and agency? If we do, then (a) we find it difficult to establish that there is such a being, except by adopting something like Dr Hudson's suggestion that we can, as it were, license ourselves to believe in him by suitably fixing our criterion of reality-a suggestion I find less than convincing. In general, for any concept it has to be shown (i) that we have any criteria at all for its correct use (since to claim that we have them for every concept would create endless regresses) and (ii) that it makes sense to speak of using this same concept in accordance with different criteria. In particular, it is not clear that our common concept of reality is amenable to such treatment. Reality seems essentially to be what is beyond the realm of choice, what is there to be discovered; our own choices may well determine, at least in part what we discover about reality and how we record our results, but not what really exists. (b) We run into Strawsonian problems over how we could identify a non-physical, or purely spiritual being as the same being as that encountered by other believers or on other occasions. Why one god rather than many? (c) Despite what Dr Hudson says (cf. esp. p. I 75) it is doubtful if we can give sense to such terms as 'meeting', 'making', 'guiding', etc., as used of a purely spiritual being. No doubt believers sometimes speak, with unquestionable sincerity, of 'meeting' or 'encountering' God, but again the most penetrating accounts of such 'meetings' leave little doubt about their authors' dis satisfaction with the two-person model suggested by the termn; indeed the fading of one's own sense of personal identity seems much more characteristic of such situations than awareness of the presence of another person. I can do no more here than to suggest as an alternative policy that we try to identify the concept of deity by reference to its essential role in the lives of religious believers (especially those to whom belief has made most difference) rather than by reference to their attempts, often and perhaps inevitably inadequate, to give it outward expression; in short, focus on</page><page sequence="3">354 RELIGIOUS STUDIES what gives rise to the language-game rather than on the game itself, and be prepared, as the most serious religious writers always have been, to alter the game if the resultant insights warrant it. The limitations of Dr Hudson's otherwise admirable defence of theism may, I am suggesting, be due not so much to any inherent flaw in theism as such, as to his democratic adherence to a widely-accepted expression of it, which is no doubt adequate for many purposes but not entirely so for his.
