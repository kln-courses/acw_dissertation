Maimonides' sense of history KENNETH SEESKIN Northwestern University, Evanston, U.S.A. E-mail: k-seeskin@northwestern. edu Abstract. Although it is often said that Maimonides lacked a sense of history, the truth is that he lacked our sense of history, which means a sense of history according to which historical change produces conceptual change. This article explores his use of historical materials to explain the reasons for many of the commandments as well as his commitment to the stability of human nature and scientific knowledge. Though much of his view is no longer credible, his belief in the contingency of historical change has much to recommend it. It is often justifiably said that Maimonides lacked a sense of history. In the words of Salo Baron, Maimonides was not just unhistorical but consciously so.1 In many ways Baron's view restates Spinoza's criticism in the Theologico-Political Treatise. For Maimonides the Torah is a repository of truth. Although it may seem to assert things that we know to be false, this impression is easily dispelled if we interpret it correctly. Should the literal meaning of a passage conflict with what reason has established, we have no choice but to interpret the passage in a way that resolves the conflict. Even though the Torah says that God has emotions and occupies space, Maimonides argues we must remove any trace of anthropomorphism lest the Torah appear to be speaking nonsense. As he reminds us when discussing the opening lines of Genesis, the gates of figurative interpretation are never shut.2 For Spinoza this is simply not true:3 ... although the literal meaning is repugnant to the natural light of reason, nevertheless, if it cannot be clearly overruled on grounds and principles derived from its Scriptural "his tory;" it, that is, the literal meaning, must be the one re tained: and contrariwise if these passages literally interpreted are found to clash with principles derived from Scripture, though such literal interpretation were in absolute harmony with reason, they must be interpreted in a different manner, that is, metaphorically. Note the use of the word "history" [historia]. If the available evidence shows that Moses believed God has emotion and occupies space, how *</page><page sequence="2">130 KENNETH SEESKIN ever repugnant these doctrines may be to us, we have to ascribe them to him. If reason can show that God has no emotions, we should affirm that doctrine as our own but be honest enough to admit that Moses and his contemporaries thought otherwise. From Spinoza's perspective, the problem with Maimonides is that he fails to distinguish meaning and truth. The result is that he never studies meaning as an independent category and never asks what we would consider a historical question: Apart from our beliefs about God, what did our ancestors believe? I say this criticism has justification because there are any number of places where Maimonides' lack of historical understanding stands out. For example there is the claim that Moses and the patriarchs were accomplished philosophers but that owing to centuries of persecution, most of their works were lost.4 Anomalous as this may seem, we must try to understand his reasons for saying it. For Maimonides monotheism is not just a conviction but a certainty, something whose truth can be grasped by reason alone. The idea that someone could rise to the level of prophet and be ignorant of it is therefore impossible. It follows that if we lack any record of philosophic activity on the part of the prophets, it must be because they were reluctant to commit their teaching to writing. Just as there was a prohibition against committing the oral law to writing, so, Maimonides argues, there was a similar attitude toward philosophy and a tradition of passing it from teacher to student over a period of time. When persecution and migration ensued, the chain of transmission was broken and a whole tradition of learning disappeared. Since Moses is the wisest person who ever or will ever live, there is no chance of improving on the knowledge he possessed. But there is a chance of reconstructing parts of it and keeping the tradition that began with Abraham alive. Strictly speaking even Abraham was not the first member of that tradition but rediscovered the monotheism known to Adam and lost during the time of Enosh. Although the Torah says nothing about Adam's theology, in view of the fact that Adam spoke directly to God, Maimonides thinks he is justified in concluding that Adam must have possessed perfect metaphysical knowledge.5 This is consistent with his claim in the Mishneh Torah that God gave Adam six commandments, including the prohibitions against blasphemy and idolatry. The reason he offers for this claim is that human reason approves of them and such a reading is evident from "the general tenor of the Scriptures."6 For Spinoza such a view is outrageous; for Maimonides it has ample precedent in Rabbinic literature and follows standard practice.</page><page sequence="3">MAIMONIDES' SENSE OF HISTORY 131 Though Maimonides does not mention history in the same breath as physics, logic, and metaphysics, his view was quite common for its time. Aristotle, it will be recalled, thought history inferior to poetry because it deals with the singular rather than the universal.7 As Baron remarks in a more generous moment, it makes no sense to judge the level of understanding displayed by a medieval writer from the vantage point of modern historical scholarship, which can rely on bodies of research and the application of methods far beyond anything available to Maimonides.8 For the most part, the sources on which Maimonides relies for his knowledge of history are the Bible and aggadic sections of the Talmud. Though he is prepared to reject anything that contradicts established scientific results, historical legends such as those dealing with Abraham's discovery of monotheism rarely do. And since many of those legends support Maimonides' own convictions, he has no reason not to take them at their word. Even if there is no written record of Abraham's monotheism, from Maimonides' perspective, it is impossible to suppose he could have believed anything else. At Guide 3.50 Maimonides discusses some of the details that appear in the narrative portions of the Torah and argues that even the smallest ones teach important lessons. The stories of the flood and of Sodom and Gomorrah show that God is the judge of all earth. The victory of Abraham and his allies over the four eastern kings (Genesis 14: 1-24) shows that a country does not need a king to be victorious and that Abraham could have made military conquest a goal of his life but chose not to. The genealogy of Seir (Genesis 36: 20-30) shows that not all the people of the kingdom of Amalek are children of Amalek and deserve to be killed. Maimonides concludes that if we knew the details surrounding these events, we would not regard them as insignificant. But since we have few chronicles to consult, there is a tendency to skip over such events and treat them as if they did not matter. This is all very interesting and indicates that Maimonides was aware of the paucity of evidence at his disposal; but it is a long way from Biblical history, as we understand it. From our perspective, he rarely takes a critical approach to his material and does little to establish a context in which to view it. There are simply facts and the lessons they teach. We should keep in mind, however, that it was not until the nineteenth century that universities began to teach history as a subject separate from theology or the study of Greek and Roman classics. Of this subject Maimonides knew nothing. So in asking whether he had a sense of history, we must take care to avoid anachronism. Once we do,</page><page sequence="4">132 KENNETH SEESKIN it will become clear that his understanding of history is more complex than it appears. Not surprisingly, the focal point of Maimonides' view of history - or, to put it more precisely, of the past and of possible links between past events - is the fate of the Jewish people. Though he recognizes the contributions of other cultures like the ancient Greeks, instead of a rival to Judaism, he sees them as independent discoveries of the wisdom acquired by Moses and the patriarchs. The cornerstone of that wisdom is the acceptance of monotheism and the rejection of idolatry. We saw that Maimonides traces monotheism all the way back to the prehistory of the human race. Once the history of man begins, there is the loss and subsequent rediscovery of monotheism by Abraham, its transmission to the other patriarchs, its abandonment during the Egyptian captivity, its second rediscovery and perfection during the time of Moses, its transmission from Moses to the other prophets and eventually to the Rabbis. Overall Maimonides sees history, the past, sacrally, as was the medieval wont. It is the story of how a small nation entrusted with a sacred doctrine struggled to survive in a hostile world, a history, therefore, of abiding (sacral) verities.9 However difficult these struggles may be, in Maimonides' opinion, they do not affect the truth of the doctrine. Just as monotheism was true during the Egyptian captivity when most Jews lost touch with it, it remains true despite centuries of exile and persecution. As far as he is concerned, the principles upon which the Torah rests have not changed since ancient times and will not change as history moves forward. That is why he can say in Perek Helek that anyone who believes them is a part of Israel no matter how many other sins he may have committed, while anyone who rejects even one is a heretic who should be destroyed. This does not mean that he did away with the laws governing conversion but that for him Judaism is first and foremost the acceptance of a body of truth. The inability of history to alter these truths is also evident in his conception of the Messiah. Maimonides has no doubt that some day a king will arise who adheres to the precepts of the Torah, prevails on others to do so, and restores sovereignty to Israel. In addition to the blessings he confers on Israel, the Messiah will lead gentile nations to monotheism and help them see the folly of their ways. The days of the Messiah will be marked by an end to war, strife, and famine and produce an environment in which people can devote their energies to science and eventually to worship of God. But at a deeper level everything will go on as before. There will still be rich and poor, strong</page><page sequence="5">MAIMONIDES' SENSE OF HISTORY 133 and weak. There will still be the normal cycle of birth, growth, and death - even for the Messiah. In Maimonides' words: "Let no one think that in the days of the Messiah any of the laws of nature will be set aside, or any innovation be introduced into creation. The world will follow its normal course."10 What there will not be when the Messiah comes are miracles. Mai monides' view is written against the background of centuries of spec ulation about the end of days. Some thought death will be abolished, some that the earth will bring forth woven garments and cooked food, some that everyone will live in luxury. From his perspective, all of this is folly. As Menachem Kellner argues, if there is going to be progress, it will have to come about by natural means so that rather than relying on divine intervention, people will have to rely on the development of their own talents.11 We must be careful not to foist on Maimonides a modern under standing of progress. While the Messiah will bring about important changes, the general direction of that change will be to take us back to the way things were before the Temple was destroyed. This will allow Israel to perform all of the commandments, including those dealing with the sacrificial cult. In the words of Gershom Scholem, the changes wrought by the Messiah will be mainly restorative: sovereignty will re turn, and with it, prophecy.12 Even in regard to the latter, Maimonides' conservatism asserts itself: while there will be prophets, the range of subjects on which they can offer advice is greatly restricted. They can implore the people to obey the Torah and warn of dire consequences if they do not. They can address specific issues like where to build a wall or when to go to war.13 What they cannot do is change the Torah or overturn legislation mandated by the oral tradition. Any suggestion along those lines is proof that someone is a false prophet and deserves to be put to death. It is fair to say that Maimonides recognized there have been and will continue to be upheavals. The destruction of the Temple in 70 AD brought about profound changes in the way Jews worship God. The reign of the Messiah will bring about equally profound changes by rebuilding the Temple and reestablishing the sacrificial cult.14 But upheavals are part of the normal course of the past. While they may be devastating to those who experience them, in Maimonides' view, they do not raise conceptual problems. From a theoretical perspective, everything will be as it was. Maimonides' best-known use of historical argument occurs in his attempt to provide a rationale for the hukkim, commandments whose</page><page sequence="6">134 KENNETH SEESKIN utility may not be evident to the multitude. Along these lines, he argues that the prohibition against mixing fibers (sha'atnez) was instituted because mixing them was a common practice among idolaters like the Sabeans.15 Along similar lines, he speculates that in addition to pro moting health, the prohibition against mixing milk with meat may have been instituted to reject another Sabean custom.16 Maimonides admits that his knowledge of these customs is second hand but concludes that if we knew more about them "we would become clear regarding the wisdom manifested in the details of the practices prescribed in the com mandments concerning the sacrifices and the forms of uncleanness and other matters whose reason cannot, to my mind, be easily grasped."17 The clearest example of this sort of argument concerns the laws gov erning statutory prayer.18 He begins by arguing that in Biblical times prayer was simple and spontaneous. But during the age of Nebuchad nezzar, the people mingled with other nations so that no one could express anything clearly in a single language or recount praises of God in Hebrew. In Rabbi Gamliel's time, the number of heretics increased and many tried to get the people to turn away from God.19 Under these circumstances the only reasonable response was to standardize prayer so that everyone from the most eloquent to the completely inarticulate could praise God without introducing foreign elements. Had historical circumstances not intervened, we might still be praying as Abraham did. Beyond the need to make prayer statutory, there is the question of why we need prayer at all. Since God is beyond any praise we can offer, why issue commandments requiring people to pray? According to Maimonides the answer has to do with the pagan background from which Judaism emerged and to which it retreated during the Egyptian captivity. The pagan nations erected elaborate temples in which they sacrificed animals, burned incense, and worshipped their gods. Since "man, according to his nature, is not capable of abandoning suddenly all to which he is accustomed," God could not ask Israel to make a sudden transition from one form of worship to another.20 Instead the outward forms of worship were kept but transferred from imaginary deities to the one true God. Since prayer is a substitute for animal sacrifice, the same analysis applies to it. A prophet who asked the people to abandon animal sac rifice in ancient times would be like a prophet asking people to give up prayer, fasting, or calling on God in times of need. Then as now people would shake their heads in disbelief. So prayer is a concession, a case where God took into account the circumstances in which the law was</page><page sequence="7">MAIMONIDES' SENSE OF HISTORY 135 given and realized that the people would be lost without it. It follows that the commandments dealing with prayer, fast days, holidays, and Temple service reflect a degree of contingency. If Israel had responded differently to the historical circumstances in which it found itself, many of the commandments it is asked to observe may well have been different too.21 From our standpoint this raises serious questions. Why would a God who is outside of time and who reveals a Torah valid for all time take into account the historical circumstances in which revelation occurred? More specifically, if revelation takes historical circumstances into account, what happens when circumstances change? Though ani mal sacrifice may have been common in the ancient Near East, in this day and age most people would consider it revolting. Why then does Maimonides insist it will be reinstituted when the Messiah comes? Unfortunately he does not provide answers. His initial explanation - people cannot be expected to make a sudden transition - is plausible enough. The need to praise God is a recurrent feature of religious ex perience and ignoring it would have terrible consequences even today. When it comes to animal sacrifice, he restates the official Rabbinic position. As long as the Temple is in ruins, the commandments dealing with sacrifice cannot be fulfilled. But once it is rebuilt, they can and must be fulfilled because they are valid for all time. So while history can help us understand the reasons for obeying a commandment, in his opinion it cannot justify changing one. This does not rule out Rabbinic enactments (takkonot) or decrees (gezerot) designed to safeguard the Torah or the suspension of certain laws in times of crisis.22 We saw however that it does rule out invalidating a law of the Torah or an authoritative ruling of the oral tradition. In sum, Maimonides is open to the possibility of temporal change as long as it is political rather than conceptual. While the Messiah will improve the quality of life, he will not introduce new ways of looking at it. On the contrary, the standards for separating truth from error, justice from criminality, and the sacred from the profane will be the same as those employed in ancient times. The reason has already been given: the world will continue to run its course and its inhabitants will adhere to their respective natures. Since the world reflects the wisdom of God, any change in the natural order would be evidence of the imperfection of the creator. That at least is how Maimonides reads Ecclesiastes 3: 14: "Whatever God does lasts forever."23 In defense of Maimonides, it should be said that his commitment to the stability of human nature was not unique. Moreover, one may see in</page><page sequence="8">136 KENNETH SEESKIN this stance what may be true historical conceptualization, placing him, in fact, on a par with others whom we normally count unreservedly as historians, including Thucydides. Regardless of his lack of belief in revealed religion or in a coming messianic kingdom, Thucydides did view behavior much as Maimonides did. In one of the most famous statements of historical methodology ever written, he tells us:24 The absence of the fabulous may make my work dull. But I shall be satisfied if it be thought useful by those who wish to know the exact character of events now past which, human nature being what it is [i.e., static], will recur in similar or analogous forms. It has not been composed to win temporary applause but as a lasting possession. He too spoke of upheavals. In fact no one ever spoke of them more eloquently. But his investigation presupposes that from one moment of history to the next, the principles needed to explain what is happening will remain the same. That is what enables him to write a book that will be a lasting possession. Over two thousand years later, David Hume, a distinguished histo rian in his own right, reported universal agreement on "a great unifor mity among the actions of men, in all nations and ages, in its principles and operations."25 Simpy put: the same sentiments and inclinations produce the same actions so that understanding how avarice, self-love, vanity, friendship, and generosity led to certain forms of behavior in Greece and Rome will enable one to understand what type of behavior they will produce in England and France. Accordingly:26 Mankind are so much the same, in all times and places, that history informs us of nothing new or strange in this par ticular. Its chief use is only to discover the constant and universal principles of human nature, by showing men in all varieties of circumstances and situations, and furnishing us with materials from which we may form our observations and become acquainted with the regular springs of human action and behavior. He concludes that the actions of his contemporaries are just as close to the actions described by Polybius and Tacitus as the earth, water, and other elements investigated by scientists are to the earth, water, and elements investigated by Aristotle and Hippocrates. It is not my intention to minimize the differences between these thinkers. Thucydides and Hume had more evidence at their disposal</page><page sequence="9">MAIMONIDES' SENSE OF HISTORY 137 and approached it in a more critical fashion than Maimonides. Rather than a secular study of human motivation, he views history as a re ligious narrative that moves from oppression to eventual redemption. My only point is that having a sense of or appreciation for human action in time is not the same as believing that our conception of the course of this action alters our conception of what it is to be a human being. Unlike Hegel, Marx, or Nietzsche, none of these thinkers claim to have witnessed the dawn of a new age or to have prepared the way for a different order of person. If Hume is right, a political leader transported from one century to another would have little problem understanding the conflicts and opportunities in his new surroundings. In view of this, it would be better to say that what Maimonides lacked is not a sense of history but the sense of history that measures change in terms of conceptual revolution. For him there are no para digm shifts of the sort described by Thomas Kuhn because there are no paradigms to begin with; rather there is a true account of the world and the difficulties we face in trying to grasp it. Consider his view of science.27 Maimonides believes that Aristotle's account of the sublunar world is correct and that anyone who disagrees with it either fails to understand or has preconceived notions to the contrary.28 That is not to say that disagreements never arose. To take an obvious example, the Mutakallimun rejected the idea of essential natures and that of causal connection, but Maimonides thought they relied on "wild imaginings" rather than sound argument. His view of the sublunar realm leaves open the possibility of scientific advance ments like the discovery of a new species or the development of new medical procedures, but all of these are within the realm of what Kuhn calls "normal" science. Maimonides does not talk about revolutionary science, but then no one in the middle ages had any experience - and, hence, no consciousness - of a scientific revolution of the sort we associate with Copernicus, Galileo, or Newton. To appreciate Maimonides' view, we should keep in mind that while medieval science relied on observation, it did not possess the idea of a controlled experiment. Knowledge was acquired by generalizing from experience. But experience rarely provides the kind of isolation needed to test specific hypotheses or take precise measurements. It took a long time before Galileo tested falling bodies for constant acceleration and years before he could explain what he saw. From Maimonides' perspective, the possibility that a scientist would uncover systematic flaws in Aristotle's natural philosophy was therefore next to nothing.</page><page sequence="10">138 KENNETH SEESKIN In regard to the supralunary world, the picture is different because Maimonides knew full well that Aristotle's astronomy faced difficulties. The crux of that theory is that all celestial spheres move in circular orbits at a constant speed around a fixed center. As all students of astronomy recognized, there is no obvious way to account for planetary orbits on this assumption. Aristotle himself introduced the idea of a reversing sphere, or sphere moving in the opposite direction of the one above it, but could find no explanation for why celestial motion should suddenly change directions.29 In all Aristotle needed either 47 or 55 spheres to account for the movement of the sun, moon, and five planets visible to the naked eye. Even if we grant the number of spheres he needs, the predictive power of his system was seriously flawed. The best alternative was the theory of Ptolemy, which makes use of epicycles and eccentric orbits, both of which violate the principle of a fixed center of rotation. Although he admires the accuracy of Ptolemy's calculations, Maimonides objects that the use of epicycles and eccentrics is "entirely outside the bounds of reasoning."30 "How," he asks, "can one imagine a rolling motion in the heavens or a motion around a center that is not immobile?"31 Both Averroes and Aquinas expressed similar doubts.32 We are left with what Maimonides describes as a genuine perplexity. It is not that the motion of the planets is arbitrary but that there appears to be no hope of finding a theory that accounts for what we observe and still preserves the hypothesis of concentric spheres. Citing Psalm 115 ("The heavens are the heavens of the Lord, but the earth He has given to the sons of man"), Maimonides argues that the heavens are too far away and too high in place and rank for us to know their substance and causes. Accordingly (GP 2.24, p. 326): "Regarding all that is in the heavens, man grasps nothing but a small measure of what is mathematical; and you know what is in it." This suggests that while progress has been made since Aristotle's day, it is unlikely that substantial progress will be made in the future. Though Maimonides admits that someone may find a satisfactory explanation that will resolve his perplexity, we should not to read too much into this. Rather than Copernicus, what he has in mind is a better version of Aristotle. Once we get to divine science or metaphysics, the speculative nature of human knowledge becomes so pronounced that conceptual change is all but impossible. According to Maimonides, earthly matter is a dark veil that prevents us from apprehending something not composed of matter or composed of matter of a different sort, which is the matter of the heavenly spheres.33 Thus all we can expect from metaphysics</page><page sequence="11">MAIMONIDES' SENSE OF HISTORY 139 are a few flashes of light followed by a return to darkness. Though we can demonstrate that God exists and is neither a body nor a force in a body, after that, demonstration is all but impossible. When it comes to what God is, the only thing we know is that God cannot be limited or qualified by any concept so that "It is well known among all people engaged in speculation, who understand what they say, that God cannot be defined."34 As long as this is true, shifting from one set of concepts to another accomplishes nothing. Maimonides was wrong about natural science. Clearly we know more about physics than anyone in his day would have thought possible. Though he saw the study of physics as a means of understanding the ways and works of God, modern physics has renounced teleology and any connection with divinity. But metaphysics is a different story. If the essence of God is truly unknowable, we are no closer to understanding it than our ancestors were. The reason Maimonides does not think in terms of paradigms or conceptual revolutions is that they too have a history, one that began long after he died - with Kant. It was after all Kant who showed how much the mind must contribute to experience in order for experience to make sense. The traditional view was that concepts are formed from the data of experience. What he showed is that even the most basic forms of experience involves categories, judgments, and acts of synthesis that go well beyond anything the data themselves can supply. That raises the question of what we mean by data in the first place. According to Kant the empirical world presents itself to us in Euclidian space and moves in conformity with the principles of Newtonian physics. While the medievals followed Aristotle in distinguishing between the active and passive intellect, none could have imagined that the mind is active in anything like Kant's sense, that the order of nature is not just something we find but something we build or impose. Where Kant agrees with the medievals is in his commitment to stability. Though he does not talk about the permanence of essential natures as the medievals did, neither does he provide for the possibility of developing categories or judgments that would enable us to organize experience in a totally new way. The structure we have is the structure we are always going to have. The problem is that once we acknowledge the mind's role in organizing experience, it is hard to avoid the conclu sion that if it were to play a different role, the world would seem like a different place. Thus two people looking at "the same phenomenon" might come away with incompatible accounts of what they saw - not that one would praise it and another not, or that one would recognize</page><page sequence="12">140 KENNETH SEESKIN features the other had missed - but that one would employ categories that made no sense to the other. Following N. R. Hanson, imagine Aristotle and Newton tracing the path of a projectile or Tycho and Kepler watching a sunrise.35 While there is a sense in which they see the same thing, it would be difficult to say with precision what it is. This is what philosophers are talking about when they claim that experience is theory laden. Applying the theory ladenness of observation to Abraham, we might ask whether he would have accepted or even understood our view of monotheism. Note for example that neither the Torah nor the prophets speak with a single voice on a question as basic as whether God can be seen.36 Once we admit that experience is theory laden, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that if theories change over time, what counts as experience must change as well. It is in this context that we can appreciate the theories of cultural evolution that became popular in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Rather than look to physics, mathemat ics, or psychology for its inspiration, philosophy looked to history. In the Jewish world, this phenomenon is visible in the work of Solomon Formstecher and Samuel Hirsch. For them monotheism is not a fact that is periodically lost and rediscovered but a moral and intellectual achievement that takes centuries to develop and articulate. As late as the Nineteenth Century, philosophies of history were still "messianic" in the sense that they had a goal against which progress could be measured and a corresponding conception of what the end of history would be like. For Hegel history is the story of how God reveals himself in ever greater clarity through the dialectical process. Granted that he replaces the traditional view of God with his own conception of Spirit, and measures history by the degree to which mankind becomes conscious of its own freedom. Still there is no denying that theological overtones are present. History is not just a string of loosely connected events but the outcome of a necessary process that reaches its fulfill ment or eschaton in the final stage of development so that early stages can be seen as nascent versions of the final stage and for that reason are redeemed by the final stage.37 To return to Maimonides, theory ladenness plays no part in his philosophy nor do conceptual changes of the sort that occurred between Tycho and Kepler. We desperately want him to say that while Abraham started a tradition that we carry on, it is a mistake to search for a fixed set of beliefs that we share with him. Instead we get the articles of faith set forth in Perek Helek. Even if we were to eliminate those dealing with Moses or the Torah, how many can we ascribe to the patriarchs with</page><page sequence="13">MAIMONIDES' SENSE OF HISTORY 141 any degree of certainty? How many can we ascribe to ourselves in an age when modern scholarship makes a powerful case for multiple authorship and no case for Abraham, Moses, or an Exodus from Egypt? Although Maimonides' rationalism requires that we deal with any body of scholarship whose methods are rigorous and results credible, there is no point in speculating on how he would respond to questions that were not raised until long after his death. His sense of history accords with the evidence he had and the theoretical sophistication on which he could draw. He uses argument based on past happenings in areas where demonstration is not available. He believes in progress to the degree that it involves the actualization of human potential rather than the creation of a new type of human being. He has contempt for those who try to predict the future by turning to astrology or working with magical numbers. Still it is hard to read Maimonides without coming away with the impression that for him the course of events poses a great enigma. If God entrusted Israel with a sacred doctrine, if the other nations of the world have turned to idolatry and persecuted Israel, why have the fortunes of Israel fallen and theirs not? The traditional answer is that Israel was sent into exile for its sins. Maimonides accepts this answer up to a point: our ancestors sinned by allowing themselves to be taken in by astrology and neglected the science of war as a result.38 As Kellner argues, Maimonides' opinion is remarkable for what it does not say - that Israel sinned and God intervened to punish them.39 Rather Israel sinned and for perfectly natural reasons, defeat followed. The problem with this explanation is that if we are to believe Mai monides, other nations practiced astrology and superstition as well - if anything to a greater extent than Israel. Why then is Israel under the sway of these nations? To be sure, Maimonides levels criticism at Israel too, but even if we take such criticism seriously, as I am inclined to do, it can hardly be said that Israel's sins are worse than her neighbor's. Given Maimonides' belief in the stability of human nature, and the tendency for people to trust what they can touch or see, it would be more reasonable to conclude that despite the differences that separate Israel from other nations, the quality of people's behavior does not vary all that much. So the question remains: Why have the fortunes of Israel fallen while those of many other nations have not? Granted that Israel's fortunes will improve when the Messiah comes and that many of the regimes that persecuted Israel have perished. There is still the question of why Israel's fortunes reached such a low ebb after the destruction of the</page><page sequence="14">142 KENNETH SEESKIN Temple and stayed there throughout Maimonides' lifetime. I suggest that when Maimonides asked himself this question, he had no answer except to say that we cannot fathom the will of God. In the Letter on Astrology, he quotes Isaiah 55:8 ("for His ways are not like our ways, neither are His thoughts like our thoughts" ) in claiming that we do not know the end of God's wisdom or the specifics of each judgment and decree. In short the course and future direction of events is unknowable. We can make general predictions about which laws or social practices will be beneficial and which harmful, but when it comes to the rise and fall of empires or the hour of Israel's redemption, we are in the dark. That is why even if he had more evidence and more rigorous methods, Maimonides still would not have regarded the study of the past as a science. In the natural world, there are droughts, floods, and outbreaks of disease. However devastating these may be, Maimonides thought they are understandable if you take the time to learn their causes. He saw no analogue in history, where the exile and persecution of Israel went unabated. He offers hope and comfort to the Jews of Yemen during a time of crisis, but he does not offer them an explanation of why they are in such desperate straits to begin with. He does not because he cannot, for he lacked the analytical skills to describe the past as would a true historian today. Maimonides' view stands in sharp contrast to those who regard history as a proving ground for ideas in which victory is awarded to the prevailing ideology of the time. In his mind, viewing the past does not allow discerning the false from the true. He saw no inner logic to the past. Nor did he think that we understand God better than our ancestors. Only reason, a faculty that reserves the right to look at the past and conclude that things have gone terribly wrong, can justly distinguish between true and false. Like any Jew, Maimonides knew of arguments that the Jews' loss of sovereignty was clear evidence that God had turned his back on Israel, but obviously he rejects such claims. As David Hartman argues, there is no suggestion in Maimonides that we can penetrate the secrets of the divine mind and decipher the "cunning of history." That would remain for Hegel to propose, whose own critics, need it be said, have been many.40 For Maimonides, man can only have faith that God's promises will be fulfilled; how and when remains a mystery. Were Maimonides asked what history affirms and what it rejects, his advice would be to stop looking for the hand of God in all that happens and admit that at any number of junctures, events might - and could - have taken a different turn. He would insist</page><page sequence="15">MAIMONIDES' SENSE OF HISTORY 143 solely that regardless of events, the truth of monotheism was worth preserving, and the laws needed to instill this truth in human society were still valid.

This does not mean that Maimonides denied the possibility of miracles altogether. Though he is often skeptical of Biblical miracles and looks for naturalistic explanations, he accepts the fact that temporary disruptions of the natural order can occur. To understand why, it is important to recognize that ancient and medieval science was not mechanistic. The natural world is a composite of matter and form. Since matter is unruly and occasionally refuses to accept form, it is not surprising that anomalies occur. Unlike early modern scientists who viewed even one anomaly as sufficient reason to revise or reject a natural law, the ancients and medievals believed that laws apply in most cases but not necessarily in all. So even if a miracle were to occur, it would not produce a change in the natural order as they understood it. On this issue, see Guide 2.29, pp. 345-346, 3.50, p. 616. See also the essay of Y. T.

Just as we have no choice but to invoke God's will when dealing with the diversity of natural phenomena, so, Maimonides thinks, we have no choice but to invoke it when dealing with many of the commandments. Cf. Guide 2.25, p. 329.
