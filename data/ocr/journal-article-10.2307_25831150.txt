<plain_text><page sequence="1">120 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Sufi Hermeneutics: The Qur'an Commentary of Rashld al-Din MaybudL By Annabel Keeler. Qur'anic Studies Series, 3. London: Institute of Ismaili Studies and Oxford University Press. London, 2006. Pp. 378. ?55.00. Annabel Keeler's study of Rashid al-Din al-Maybudl's (d. c. 520/1126) Qur'an commentary written in Classical Persian, the Kashf al-asrdr wa-cuddat al-abrdr (The Unveiling of Mysteries and Provisions of the Righteous'), is part of the Institute of Ismaili Studies Qur'anic Studies series. Based on Keeler's DPhil thesis, Sufi Hermeneutics marks a new milestone through its contributions to the study of the history of Sufism, the development of mystical approaches to the Qur'an, the performative aspects of Persian poetry, and Qur'anic exegesis. In the course of providing a detailed textual analysis based on the Kashf al-asrdr's previously unexplored manuscript tradition and incorporating an impressive range of Arabic and Persian sources in order to place al-Maybudi's approach to Qur'anic hermeneutics into a broader context, Keeler's work engages the reader by raising many questions concerning the development of Qur'anic hermeneutics during the formative period of Sufism. At the same time, building on the previous scholarship of luminaries in the fields of Sufism and mystical Qur'anic exegesis such as G. Bowering, P. Lory, L. Massignon, and P. Nwyia, this monograph offers new insights into how 'mystical doctrines are expounded through the exegesis of the Qur'an, and ... how the interpretations reflect the particular mystical outlook of the author' (p. xxv). Sufi Hermeneutics is divided into three main parts ('Part I: Hermeneutics', 'Part II: Mystical doctrine', and 'Part III: Maybudi's mystical interpretation of the stories of the prophets'), including ten chapters in all. It also includes an introduction, conclusions, an index of Qur'an citations and an index of the book. In the introduction to al-Maybudi's life and works, Keeler addresses the significance of his Qur'anic commentary written in Persian and the hermeneutics of Qur'anic exegesis. She traces the development of Sufism from its 'origins' to the 'formative' period of Persian Sufism and love mysticism, introducing the current state of scholarship on Qur'anic hermeneutics. The introduction also presents one of the overarching arguments of Sufi Hermeneutics: how al-Maybudi's Kashf al-asrdr may have served a wider and more general audience than previously discussed in the scholarly literature, foremost by providing instructional commentaries on Qur'anic ayas and giving expression (poetic and non-poetic) to the spiritual guidance of irshdd (p. 40). Chapter Two delves more deeply into al-Maybudi's criteria for interpretation, on the basis that: '[h]is principles concerning the latter will be placed in context by comparing them to those of Abu Hamid al-Ghazzall, and will be contrasted with the criteria for esoteric interpretation which Maybudi holds in common with other Sufis' (p. 39). Keeler provides a succinct summary of al-Maybudi's approach to Qur'anic</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 121 exegesis, supported by well-selected and carefully translated passages from the Kashf al-asrdr. She also clarifies that, in structural terms, al-Maybudf s Qur'an commentary entails three aspects (nawbat): the literal reading of ay as, the esoteric interpretation (allegorical meaning, tantamount to the tropological, the mystical or anagogical: see pp. 69-72), and instructional anecdotes or poetic verses. In addition, Chapter Two adresses how al-Maybudf s Sufi Qur'an commentary incorporates components of translation, exoteric commentary and esoteric interpretation (p. 39), and clarifies al-Maybudf s position on the methods of exegesis: commentaries on the basis of received tradition (tafslr bi'l-maJthur), on the basis of reasoned opinion (tafslr bi'l-ra?y), and forms of esoteric interpretation or allegorical interpretation (ta?wll). An additional category of exegesis that receives attention is spiritual guidance or direction (irshad), which is related to al-Maybudf s homiletics and use of anecdotes and poetry (p. 50). Keeler's juxtaposition of al Maybudf s Qur'anic hermeneutics with al-Ghazalf s (d. 505/1111) and Abu'l-Qasim al-Qushayrfs (d. 465/1072) methods allows the reader to gain a clearer sense of how these authors drew upon different interpretations of the divergences between tafslr bi'l-ma3thur and tafslr bVl-ra3y, and took varying stances on clarification in terms of a preference for interpreting the 'ambiguous verses' (mutashabihai) and 'anthropomorphic verses' in the Qur'an. In addition, these comparisons further support Keeler's argument concerning al-Maybudf s theory of the principles of tafslr, especially with regard to esoteric interpretation. Concerning al-Maybudf s application of ta?wll, Keeler effectively poses the question: does he use tafslr and ta?wll to mean simply 'interpretation', as in the case of Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (d. 310/923)? According to al-Maybudi, tafslr is closer in meaning to tafslr bi'l-ma^hur and ta?wll to tafslr biyl-ra?y. It is therefore possible, as Keeler suggests, that taJwll has taken on negative connotations. For example, in Kashf al-asrar he takes a polemical turn and refutes those methods of interpretation that do not give weight to the literal meaning of Qur'anic ayas (pp. 44-5). Chapter Three, 'The Hermeneutics of Mystical Commentary in the Kashf al-asrar\ presents al-Maybudf s modes of interpretation in greater detail, illustrating how his Qur'an commentary creatively builds on the foundations of interpretation, explanation, classification and comment, before turning to allegorical interpretation and edification. Many of the passages in translation presented in this chapter reinforce the reader's understanding of the didactic structure of the Kashf al-asrar. According to al-Maybudi, there are three levels or stages to Qur'anic interpretation: first, a basic interpretation or summary or translation of the Qur'anic ayas; second, through the means of exoteric interpretation, providing a more detailed or thorough explanation of the ayas; and third, an interpretation that is linked to spiritual guidance and direction (p. 312). In this respect, al-Maybudf s hermeneutics does not maintain the four levels of meaning common to other Sufi exegetes, such as Sahl al-Tustari (d. 283/896)</page><page sequence="3">122 Journal of Qur'anic Studies and Abu cAbd al-Rahman al-Sulaml (d. 412/1021), thereby shifting the function of the esoteric or allegorical modes of interpretation within the commentary itself (pp. 69-74). Keeler underscores how this three-fold structure of Qur'anic interpretation mirrors the individual's potential to progress from the 'level of outward observance of the generality of believers (camm) to the level of the elite (khass) and finally to the level of the elite of the elite (khass al-khawassY (p. 80). In Part II, Chapter Four, Keeler addresses the subject of love mysticism and al Maybudi's contribution to Persian Sufism. The lasting legacy of the Hanbali Sufi cAbd Allah al-Ansari (d. 482/1089) may also be seen in the emphasis al-Maybudi places on the observance of the religious law (Sharica) and the acceptance of Islamic religious tenets as the necessary foundations for attaining mystical knowledge and experiencing mystical truth (p. 111). The main idea underlying Keeler's argument concerning Sufi teachings and texts is that during the process of students and disciples recording and writing down al-Ansari's teachings and doctrines, al-Maybudi transforms the 'Ansari tradition', thereby lending it '... a stamp of universality' (p. 115). Chapter Five takes as its point of departure al-Maybudi's commentaries on God and creation (p. 124). Sub-sections in this chapter on the light of Muhammad, the creation of Adam, Adam's banishment from Paradise and the story of the Covenant (mithaq, Q. 7:172) nicely illustrate al-Maybudi's concepts of prophecy, the individual human being and God's intimacy with human beings as well as point out how in different contexts, al-Maybudi's mystical exegesis (in prose or poetic form) focuses entirely on the Islamic tenets. The centrality of the theme of mystical love receives extensive treatment. Keeler explains, 'Maybudi understands the divine purpose in creation as being for the sake of knowledge and love' (p. 129). Though the Kashf al-asrar may not present a specific cosmological system, al-Maybudi's prioritisation of love over knowledge in terms of God's creation underscores his general concerns with the centrality of mystical love (p. 130). Chapter Six examines in greater detail al-Maybudi's teachings and his theory of spiritual guidance, outlining al-Maybudi's concept of the human being, his/her engagement in the practices of inner reflection, or the 'psychology' of controlling the ego/carnal soul (nafs), and the 'stages of progression on the spiritual way' (p. 157). Chapter Seven addresses al-Maybudi's theological approach to mysticism and his treatment of love. Looking at key concepts such as God's pre-etemal decree (taqdir), knowledge, and love, Keeler discusses the development of the tradition of love mysticism in Iran, contrasting the 'schools' of Sufism and their debates over what may be translated perhaps roughly as 'affectionate love' (mahabba) versus 'passionate love' (cishq). In the course of situating al-Maybudi as a Sufi author in the Ansari tradition, Chapter Seven takes up an additional set of issues: the contribution of</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 123 Persian poetry to Islamic mysticism, recitation of Persian poetry in Sufi dances and auditions of recitation and music (samdc), and the history of composing Persian prose texts and the transmission of oral teachings. This chapter provides many detailed examples from al-Ansari's teachings that al-Maybudl quotes and explicates in the Kashf al-asrdr. Keeler carefully introduces to the reader those instances where al Maybudi forges a separate path in the development of love mysticism in the context of the broader Sufi tradition: for example, he does not show the same hesitation as al Ansari to use the terminology of mahabba and cishq and he draws upon poetry, allegory and Qur'anic ay as in order to present his teachings on love mysticism (p. 116). Part III provides three rich case studies that discuss the Qur'anic narratives of the prophets Abraham, Moses and Joseph, with the aim of illustrating how mystical hermeneutics and Sufi doctrine are interconnected in al-Maybudl's Kashf al-asrdr. Furthermore, the Qur'anic stories of the prophets provide solid examples of the sixth/ twelfth-century expansion of Sufi teachings and contemplative doctrines in different contexts and aimed at varying audiences or, as Keeler explains, how al-Maybudl presents Sufi doctrines on the spiritual path and mystical love 'in a non-technical manner' (p. 199). Particularly noteworthy is the material in translation from the Kashf al-asrdr, which is presented for the first time in English translation, and which includes careful references to al-Maybudi's sources. It is important, however, to add a few general comments here on current approaches in the field of Qur'anic Studies. Pioneering works may prompt or even challenge scholars to consider a new set of questions and issues. A strong indication of Keeler's contribution to the fields of Qur'anic studies and Sufism lies in the fact that Sufi Hermeneutics introduces some thought-provoking discussions on the sixth/twelfth century Persian Sufi Qur'an commentary, Kashf al-asrdr. Nonetheless, some of Keeler's introductory statements on the development of mystical exegesis may not support effortlessly the material presented from the primary sources in Parts II and III of Sufi Hermeneutics. For example, Keeler's treatment of the current state of Qur'anic hermeneutics seems to suggest that, from the third/ninth century, there was a growing divide between the authors of mystical exegesis and those of exoteric commentaries and that 'mystical exegesis may have had a separate existence quite naturally because it demanded a different approach and was intended for a more specialised audience of people who were to some extent involved in mysticism' (p. 10). In other contexts she presents solid evidence that suggests a genre of mystical exegesis was already in place at the time that al-Maybudl wrote his work, one which incorporated both exoteric and esoteric forms of commentary (pp. 69-81). At face value, this minor inconsistency in argumentation suggests that the author relied at times too extensively on existing scholarly literature to situate al-Maybudl as an exegete and a Sufi rather than to construct an independent theoretical framework for introducing the unique aspects of</page><page sequence="5">124 Journal of Qur'anic Studies al-Maybudi's Qur'an commentary and the aims of his scholarly project as a Sufi author in the Ansari tradition. Also to be noted are the errors appearing in the text, which include some missing citations and references (p. xvi: Kashf al-asrar, read Kashf al-asrdr; p. xxi: AncM, read Ansari; p. 98, n. 23: spacing; p. 120, n. 25: Ikhwan rather than Ijwan; p. 122, n. 57: no citation or page number included; p. 213, n. 8: no italicisation for chapter titles in Arabic; p. 112: nd daryafta, read nd dar ydfta; p. 144, n. 27: incomplete footnote citation; p. 201, n. 27: read Kashf, II, p. 93). It is hoped that Dr Keeler's study will open up new possibilities for further research on al-Maybudi's Qur'an commentary and will encourage scholars in the fields of Qur'anic studies and Sufism to engage in more in-depth research on Qur'anic exegesis in the mystical traditions of Islam. In sum, Keeler's Sufi Hermeneutics marks a valuable scholarly contribution. It is highly recommended for specialists in the field, general readers interested in the history of Sufism and Qur'anic studies, and may be used as a reading for university level courses in religious studies, Persian literature and/or Islamic studies.
