Destruction, and potential destruction, of rock art, both by natural agents and by human actions, has been reported all over the world. Most recently, the controversy regarding the C?a Valley petroglyphs in Portugal, threatened by inundation through the construction of a flood-control dam, received considerable cov erage in the international media (Bednarik, 1995, pp. 86-87). This case, however, is only the tip of the iceberg. As the following sad story from Egypt illustrates, much rock art disappears in silence. SOME HISTORICAL ANTECEDENTS Already in 1912, the destruction of rock drawings in the Wadi Abu Agag, north of Aswan in Upper Egypt, was reported by the German ex plorer G. Schweinfurth (1912, p. 634), well before any general awareness regarding the scientific potential and fundamental cultural value of rock art. Here, quarrying activities in 1907 led to the breaking-up of a sandstone boulder covered with anthropomorphic representations and a variety of symbols. Further destruction at the same site, already feared by Schwein furth, was reported by J. H. Dunbar (1941, p. 60) about 30 years later. Among the victimized drawings was a rare representation of a camel that had been attributed, on the basis of an accompanying hieratic inscription, to the late Old Kingdom. In 1967, P. E. L. Smith (1967, p. 203) warned of laboratory for Prehistory, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Redingenstraat 16, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium. 3 0263-0338/98/0300-0003$ 15.00/0 ? 1998 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">4 Huyge the imminent destruction of rock art sites through quarrying for building materials in the area of Gebel el-Silsila. Iconoclasm of an even more or ganized nature was reported by W. Mayer in 1981 in the Wadi Abu Sobeira, about 15 km north of Aswan, where a number of sites seemed irrevocably threatened by the systematic industrial exploitation of the Nubian sand stone escarpments. Several rock art sites must have vanished since then and it is highly likely that this destruction is ongoing (see Lauwers, 1995). THE WADI MAHAMID PETROGLYPHS The sites in the Wadi Mahamid that are the subject of this paper were discovered during surveys of rock art conducted by the Belgian Archae ological Mission in 1979-1983 in the vicinity of Elkab, an Upper Egyptian historical town about 80 km south of Luxor. The Wadi Mahamid (Fig. 1) is a northerly branch of the much larger Wadi Hillal, which contains, in its semicircular, ca. 4-km-wide embouchure, several well-known petroglyph lo calities (see Huyge, 1984). The most impressive of these is the Rocher aux Vautours (Vulture Rock), a Nubian sandstone steep-sided inselberg, 80 m long by 30 m high, exhibiting 350 rock drawings and several hundreds of Old Kingdom hieroglyphic graffiti. The Wadi Mahamid sites are less spec tacular in nature but, nevertheless, contain quite a few highly interesting rock drawings. Some Greek inscriptions and representations of long-horned cattle at one of these sites, located along the southern edge of the wadi, have already been published (Bingen, 1981). The site considered here is situated along the northern edge of the wadi (Fig. 1). It consists of two isolated rock formations that extend on a rocky promontory at the intersection of the Wadi Mahamid and a northerly tributary called Khor Abu Malahia. Petroglyphs at this site are limited to some dozens of drawings, mostly animal representations (especially cattle and Nubian wild asses) and a small number of textual documents (including hieroglyphic and Arabic inscriptions). The Bull Tableau The most remarkable drawings at this site, located on the southeastern rock face of the promontory, are three magnificent bull representations on an imaginary ground line (Fig. 2). Two of these hammered outline drawings, separated by an incised plant motif (probably a later addition), are shown in confrontation (Figs. 3 and 4). The third, less elaborately drawn specimen,</page><page sequence="3">3 r w Fig. 1. The Wadi Mahamid seen from the west.

Tracing of the two opposed bulls (the length of the right specimen is 27 cm). on the right appears to have been executed by another artist. Its slightly less advanced patination clearly indicates it is more recent. The Wadi Mahamid bulls are remarkable for several reasons. The naturalistic execution of the antithetical examples, extremely close to formal Egyptian art, is unparalleled in the Upper Egyptian rock art repertoire. Their marked obesity (of the left specimen especially) and the presence of excessively elongated, overgrown hoofs, is a typical pathological abnormal ity of indoor-fed cattle (Boessneck, 1988, p. 68) and strongly suggests that they were fattened and, most probably, were sacrificial bulls (/w&gt;3-cattle, according to ancient Egyptian terminology). Close counterparts frequently figure in official tomb and temple reliefs, for instance, in the Eighteenth Dynasty tomb of Kenamun in Thebes (TT93) and in the procession scenes of the Opet (New Year) Festival in the Colonnade Hall of the Temple of Luxor (Fig. 5). The domestic character of these animals, suggested also by their docile stance, is further accentuated by the presence of brands (which in the case of the two opposed bulls resemble the hieroglyphic sign mn). The latter particularity possibly indicates that the portrayed bulls may have belonged to a large farming estate of the crown or a temple domain (Vandier, 1969, p. 280; Houlihan, 1995, p. 16). From an archaeozoological point of view, these bovines (Bos primigenius f. taurus) are clearly of the brachyceros type or short-horned variety, a breed which is not widely attested to with any degree of certainty in Egypt before the Hyksos period or the beginning of the New Kingdom (Muzzolini, 1983, p. 70; Brewer et al, 1994, p. 84). The elongated hoofs (for which several parallels exist in official iconography; see, e.g., Fig. 5) and the "abstract" brands (in contrast to the numerical markings of the Old Kingdom) may corroborate a chronological attribution to the New Kingdom (or eventually a later period).</page><page sequence="7">"Battered Bulls": Rock Art Destruction in Egypt 9 Fig. 5. Exceedingly fat, sacrificial bulls in the procession scenes of the Opet Festival in the Colonnade Hall of Luxor Temple, Eighteenth Dynasty, reign of Tutankhamun (after The Epigraphic Survey, 1994, pi. 105). "Battered Bulls" The "bull tableau site," first discovered in January 1980, was revisited by us in January 1982. At that time, the 3500-year-old bull drawings had been hammered away completely (Fig. 6). What is more, when we returned to the site in February 1986, the several-meter-high, isolated rock forma tions (Fig. 1), containing most of the other drawings, had been razed through quarrying. Evidently, the Upper Egyptian lower desert landscape, not only in Elkab but also elsewhere, has undergone drastic changes during the past decade because of the explosive expansion of settlements (in which traditional mud-brick masonry gives way to building in stone), large-scale fertilizing projects, quarrying, and the implantation of a huge industrial in frastructure for the production of phosphates. As a consequence, the rock art sites, often situated close to the Nile Valley and mostly on easily at tainable rock surfaces, are seriously endangered. Every effort should therefore be made to preserve and protect what can still be saved. Archaeological missions active in rock art-sensitive areas should consider it a priority to carry out an exhaustive survey of the region they are working in. Rock art sites should be inventoried and individual drawings copied as thoroughly as time and resources permit, by photogra phy or by any other means. An excellent example of this type of work, proving that it can be done with relatively limited means, is the reconnais sance of the hinterland of the Red Sea port of Quseir al-Qadim (Prickett, 1979).</page><page sequence="8">',&amp;&gt;&amp;$&amp; ? ?
