<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> (Pytho)Gaia in Myth and Legend:   The Goddess of the Ekron   Inscription Revisited Michael D. Press Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies  304 JBHT  University of Arkansas  Fayetteville, AR 72701  mdpress52@gmail.com The identification of Ptgyh, the goddess of the Ekron Inscription, has been a topic  of great scholarly interest since the discovery of the inscription in 1996. Unfortunately,  proposals have been suggested and repeated without sufficient critical evaluation. This  article reevaluates these proposals, focusing on the most widely suggested identifi- cation—that Ptgyh is to be identified as Pythogaia, or some other form of the Greek  goddess Gaia, first suggested by Christa Schäfer-Lichtenberger in 1998. A careful   examination of the arguments in favor of this identification reveals them to be lacking in  citations to current and significant literature on relevant topics, and to be lacking sup- porting evidence. The article then questions why, despite these problems, the identifica- tion with (Pytho)gaia has been so widely cited in the literature. Ultimately, the answer  lies in the widespread scholarly myth of a Great Goddess of the Bronze Age Aegean, and  of prehistoric religion more generally: although this myth has now been abandoned by  the majority of scholars working on prehistoric religion and iconography, it is still com- monly accepted among the wider community of archaeologists and other scholars of the  ancient world. introduction temple, respectively).
