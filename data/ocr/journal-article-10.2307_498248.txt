HEFFNER, Editor University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia PREHISTORIC, ORIENTAL AND CLASSICAL GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Bull in Ancient Myth and Religion.-The archaeological evidence, includ- ing that of cuneiform and hieroglyphic inscriptions, for the belief in the sacred or divine nature of the bull, in ancient Egypt, Western Asia and Crete, has been collected and analyzed by L. MALTEN in Jb. Arch. I. xliii (1928), pt. 1/2 (pp. 90-139; 89 figs.). Before the introduction of the horse by Indo-Europeans, all bovine creatures were important factors in the life of an agricultural community, and the conspicuous qualities of strength, fierceness, and fertility in the bull especially inspired feelings of awe and reverence. Through association with the divine powers of Nature, perhaps at first as a victim for sacrifice, he came, at least in Egypt, to share their divine nature, and was known as the "son of the sun." In Babylonia, Assyria, the Hittite empire, and the countries bordering on the Mediterranean, the process apparently did not go quite as far; the bull usually remained the attendant or symbol, and occasionally the embodiment, of greater divinities, especially the weather god, who is often represented as standing on the back of a bull or flanked by two bulls. The obvious likeness of violent storms and thunder to the mad rush and bellowing of a bull is also expressed by jagged lines of lightning above a bull. Bull, cow, and calf idols were known in all these coun- tries. The bull-man, typifying the qualities of the bull, is in Mesopotamia a human-headed bull, in Crete and perhaps originally in Cappadocia, a bull-headed man. The acrobatic encounters of youths and maidens with charging bulls, in Cretan ritual, in which the price of failure was death, may have originated, like the classical games in honor of the dead, in attempts to select victims for sacrifice. The double-axe became sacred as the implement of sacrifice, and the rhyton as the vessel from which the blood of the victim was drunk. The story of Theseus and the Minotaur belongs to the earliest invasion of Crete from the mainland of Greece by the Achaeans, that of Heracles and the Cretan bull, to the later Dorian con- quest. The Origin of Certain Architectural Forms.-At the June (1928) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society, W.

Thus the mats fastened to mud walls with woven or plaited bands secured by studs (the barbed and curved terra cotta nails have actually been found) gave rise to the old Assyrian painted wall-decoration in square panels with ornamental borders and rosettes at the corners. Bundles of reeds (or in Egypt, of papyrus) planted in the ground and tied together near the top and near the bottom became the fluted column, with capital and base, of the Greek temple. The use of such bundles of reeds to support an arched house or semi-arched aedicula has been a factor in the architectural devel- opment of other sacred buildings. The absence of natural elevations such as border the Nile valley, to serve as a refuge from river floods, compelled the in- habitants of Babylonia as early as the fourth millennium B.C. to build artificial hills, the zigurats, primarily to safeguard the homes of the gods; and when these were made inaccessible to the people, temples were built on the ground level, in the form of gates or propylaea, in which the divinity was made visible in the form of an image. These gate-temples, because of their partially sacred character, preserved some of the most primitive features, such as the roof-border, in terra cotta. Arch.

FINK discusses methods used in preserving ancient metal objects. EGYPT Alexandrian and Byzantine Portraiture.-The technique of Alexandrian plastic art is illustrated by an unique example in the Art Museum of Moscow. This is a small portrait head of a boy, from Egypt, of island (Parian?) marble, which has been covered with stucco and gilded. The back part of head and neck is rough- ened to take a thicker coat of stucco, which has fallen away. The same treatment of the surface of the back is seen in the Io head in the Hermitage Museum, which in its forms shows Praxitelian influence. The technique is purely Egyptian, inherited from the Old Kingdom. The period of the boy's head is the early Roman Empire, perhaps the time of Tiberius, but the art which it represents is not Greco-Roman. The face is an Oriental type, perhaps Lybian, and with the wide-open eyes, fixed on a vague distance, is entirely in the Egyptian tradition, a tradition which, carried on through the later Fayum funerary portraits and into the time of the divided Roman Empire, became the direct ancestor of Byzantine ecclesiastical painting.

Several of the coins which he publishes exhibit note- worthy peculiarities. ASIA MINOR Greco-Persian Minor Arts After the Persian Wars.-A study of Greco-Persian engraved gems of the fifth and fourth centuries B.c., as a contribution to the larger question of the relation of Greek and Persian art in general, was read by M. E. MAXIMOVA of Leningrad at an October (1928) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society. These gems form a well-defined class, characterized by a prevalence of Persian subjects, composed with greater freedom than in strictly Persian work, in execution far removed from the ease and naturalness of contemporary Greek work. It is an uncreative art, concerned with the content, with strict adherence to fact, and not at all with the artistic representation of a subject; and in this spirit of literalness perhaps lay its attractiveness and the cause of its popularity during the century following 430 B.c. It is distinctly not Greek, as compared even with the coins of the Greek cities of Asia Minor of this time, but is the work of Persian artists strongly influenced by Greek models, especially in grouping and composi- tion. Closely allied to these Greco-Persian gems are the contemporary so-called East Greek gems. Both classes differ from all others in using large and thick scaraboid stones, with a strong preference for blue chalcedony, and both show much the same choice of subjects, but those of the latter class, in which animals and composite monsters are frequent, are the work of Greek artists, probably in south- western Asia Minor, where the coins of satraps and dynasts show a similar mixture of Greek and Persian elements. These conclusions are of value for the understand- ing of the Erghili reliefs and for that of Persian work in precious metals. Arch. Anz. 1928, pt. 3/4, cols. 648-677 (28 figs.). GREECE GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Antiquities from Thiaki.-In B.S.A. xxix, session 1927-1928, pp. 113-116 (2 figs.), LYDIA BENTON discusses a short bronze sword in the Musie d'Histoire at Neuchatel and the Woodhouse sword in the British Museum, both from Thiaki (Ithaca) and of Mycenaean types. For comparison a sword in the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge is illustrated. A little oenochoe of "Phoenician" glass and a silver earring from Anoi, both found by John Lee in excavations at Thiaki in 1812 and now lent to the British Museum by the Society of Antiquaries, are mentioned as being also early finds on the island. The Earliest Delphic Oracle.-That the Earth-goddess, Ge, whose shrine remained on the terrace immediately south of the temple of Apollo at Delphi, was the earlier divine patron of the sacred spot, that the Pythia was originally her priestess, from whom oracles were sought on questions of the fruitfulness of fields and family, that there is no evidence of mephitic emanations or a spring of water in the adyton, and that the "lot" used here in divinations was a twig, KXA8o, broken from a sacred laurel tree,-these are among the points brought out and supported by literary and archaeological evidence by P. CORSSEN at the March (1928) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society. Arch. Anz. 1928, pt. 1/2, cols. 215-221. Notes on Greek Art of the Fourth Century.-In the archaic period, the leading form of Greek expression in art was architecture. In the middle of the fifth century, this was succeeded by sculpture, the transition being embodied in the severe style of the temple of Zeus at Olympia, in which the two arts are equally important. By the end of the fifth century, the great style of sculpture had at-</page><page sequence="4">GREEK ARCH.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1930 173 tained its highest development and was becoming mannered, to be succeeded in its turn, in the first half of the fourth century, by the predominance of painting, which rose to a height comparable to the best period of Italian painting, two thousand years later. It is because the great works of this half-century were of so perishable a nature, that our ideas of the period are so vague. We can only hope to gain some idea of its achievements by tracing their reflections in other forms of art, especially the effect on the second great period of sculpture, which flourished in the middle and in the latter half of the fourth century. To this general sketch E. PFUHL adds somewhat detailed discussions on: (1) the peplos statue, its origin in the northeast of the Peloponnesus, its use in archive and grave reliefs as well as in cult statues, especially the Eirene of Cephisodotus, which he dates at 375-370; (2) the Praxitelian type of head, especially a Heracles head in Venice, which he compares with the Hermes at Olympia; (3) the work of Scopas at Tegea, both in ornament and in figure sculpture; (4) the Mausoleum at Halicar- nassus, in which he suggests a number of points about the reconstruction of the monument and uses both stylistic grounds and the recorded positions of the sur- viving fragments to assign the different parts of the main frieze to the four sculp- tors, Timotheus and Leochares, Scopas and Bryaxis. Jb. Arch. I. xliii (1928), pt. 1/2; pp. 1-53 (2 pls.; 13 figs.). A Representation of a Centaur on a Gem.-In B.C.H. liii (1929), pp. 117-128 (4 figs.) PIERRE DEMARGNE publishes a gem purchased in 1900, probably in Crete, by Joseph Demargne, which bears a representation of a galloping Centaur, with a bough in his left hand. He has been wounded in the abdomen by an arrow. This type of figure is not uncommon in archaic art, and resembles a number of intaglios discovered at Melos; one of these, now in the Cabinet des Medailles at Paris, is published in this article, for purposes of comparison. It is generally believed that these Melian gems belong in the seventh century B.c., though some may be later. The Demargne gem would appear to belong at the end of this century or the beginning of the sixth. There is a strong resemblance between the Centaur and those depicted on the Frangois Vase, and it is suggested that, on the analogy of other contemporary finds from Crete, this gem must also be of Cretan make. The contention is made that these gems with wounded Centaurs are an abbreviated representation of one of the exploits of Herakles, where Cen- taurs appear, either the reception by Pholos, or the carrying away of Deianira by Nessos, both of which legends appear on very early works of art. The writer considers that we must seek in Asia the origin of the Centaurs, which appear in the art of Babylonia in a number of examples, and may have been transmitted into the Greek world through Cyprus and Rhodes. ARCHITECTURE The Dating of the Aegina Pediments.-The evident difference in date between the sculptures of the east and west pediments of the temple of Aphaia, now in the Glyptothek in Munich, is to be explained in connection with events in the history of Aegina before and after 500 B.C., as related by Herodotus. Apparently an early sixth-century temple of Aphaia was burnt by the Samians in their inroad of 522, and after a great naval victory in 519, over these Samians, now established in Cydonia in Crete, the Aeginetans built a temple to Athena on the acropolis of the city by the harbor, placing the trophies of the victory there, and also erected a new temple to Aphaia on the old site, to which belong the sculptures of the west pediment and the more recently discovered statues called by Furtwaengler "a third acroterion" and "not pediment sculptures," which are parts of the east pediment of that time. The east end of this temple as far as the cella was mali-</page><page sequence="5">174 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXV, 1931 ciously wrecked by adherents of the Demos in revenge for oppression at the hands of the opposite political party in the state, and at some time between 480 and 490, this end was restored, with the present east pediment, which is, therefore, some twenty years later than the west pediment. Pindar's Ode to Aphaia may have been composed for the dedication of the restored temple. H. THIERSCH. Arch. Anz. 1928, pt. 3/4, cols. 698-700. Delian Topography and Architecture.-R. VALLOIS continues his studies on this subject in B.C.H. liii (1929), pp. 185-315 (pls. VI-XV; 48 figs.). This article is devoted to the buildings of the Northern Group, around the Sacred Lake; special sections being devoted to the sanctuary of Anios, the Leto6n, the Dode- katheon, with the altar of Athena, Zeus and Hera, the Thesmophorion, the Ekkle- siasterion, and the building beside it. All these buildings are thoroughly.dis- cussed, both as to their architectural form and plan, and as to the inscriptional evidence, which enables them to be properly identified. Copious illustrations reveal their situation in relation to other monuments and shrines in the region; their ground plans are given, and measured drawings of important fragments are included. Where it is possible, as in the case of the Ekklesiasterion, a history of the building as it was originally, with subsequent additions, restorations, or reconstructions, is inserted, a feature which adds greatly to the value of the article. This important paper should be read by all who are interested in the history or art of the Hellenistic period, when Delos was at the height of its prosperity. Fortress of Korynos.-In Arch. Eph. 1927-1928 (issued 1929), pp. 112-119, JOANNES SARRES describes the ancient walls which mark the site of the fortress of Korynos on a rocky height south of the village of Kavasala in the Attic plain, and which are not marked on the latest maps of Attica, although the correct loca- tion of the site is indicated. The stronghold must have served not so much as an acropolis as a refuge for the scattered inhabitants of the region. In the neighbor- hood of this stronghold is to be located Melainai, as Milchofer suggested. An Intensive Study of the "Theseion."--A thorough technical examination of this, the best preserved of all Greek marble temples, was made by H. KOCH and E. v. STOCKAR, in 1926-1928, and the results were reported at the December (1928) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society. The plan of the building is complete and consistent, with no traces of change or of any earlier temple or shrine which it superseded. Although the Theseion is to be dated at about 450-440 B.C., and resembles the Parthenon in showing a tendency to modify the strict canon of the Doric order and an improvement in the artistic quality of the sculp- tures during the course of the work, in other respects the two buildings are so different that they were evidently designed and constructed in different schools. A peculiar feature of the Theseion is the marked accentuation of the east front, as it stood high above the market place, by greater depth of the fore-hall, by the use of sculptured and painted metopes, and especially by the extension of the inner entablature and frieze across the side aisles, thus joining the cella with the peristasis and giving an effect of breadth and unity to the entrance. The measure of one hundred Aeginetan feet is found, not in the stylobate, but in the middle one of the three steps of the base, as well as in the distance from tympanum to tympanum, and in the rectangle of this middle step alone is found a definite relation of width to length, viz 4:9. The curvature of the entablature was obtained by a slope in the topmost drums of the columns, not in the capitals, as in the Parthenon. The original roof was apparently of terra-cotta tiles. The scheme of color included red for the background of the sculptured metopes, red capitals, red for the inner epistyle and roof-beams, while the triglyphs, the unsculptured parts of the frieze and the background of the sculptured parts were blue, the careful moisture-proof-</page><page sequence="6">GREEK ARCH.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1980 175 ing of the walls with lead indicates that they were painted on the inside. No satisfactory interpretation of the subject of the east frieze, such as would settle the still conjectural assignment of the temple.to Athena and Poseidon, has yet been reached. Arch. Anz. 1928, pt. 3/4, cols. 706-721 (8 figs.). Samian Heraeum.--Excavations at the Heraeum of Samos were carried on in 1910-1914 by the Berlin Museum, and in 1925-1929 by the German Archaeo- logical Institute. In Ath. Mitt. Iv, 1930, 1-99 (Heraion von Samos: Friihe Bauten. 1 pl.; 27 inserted pls.; 45 figs.), E. BUSCHOR describes the buildings dating from the ninth century to the latter part of the sixth century B.C. The origin of the Heraeum was apparently the finding of an anthropomorphic stone, identified as Hera Parthenos because it was entangled in shoots of the agnus castus, on the shore near the mouth of a branch of the Imbrasus river about 900 B C. There had been a prehistoric settlement nearby, but since this came to an end centuries before the Geometric period, the worship of Hera cannot have been the continuation of some prehistoric cult, but must have been introduced from the Peloponnesus. The spot where the rude image was found continued to be held in veneration, and here the image was brought annually for a ceremonial bath, but the statue was housed 80 m. inland, where the slightly higher ground prevented inundation. The earliest structures on this site were naiskoi. Founda- tions of three are identified with certainty; in one of these the image was doubtless kept at first. The first temple belongs certainly to the eighth century B.c.-hence it is not surprising that the Ionian Homer should mention a temple of Athena with its cult statue (II. VI, 297 ff.). This temple of Hera was a hecatompedon (1 foot= 35 cm., a measure afterwards in use at Samos). It had a peristyle, except on the eastern end, which was open. In the interior a single row of columns or posts supported the roof, five in the pronaos and eight in the cella. The base of the cult statue was close to the west wall, and not exactly in line with the row of columns. The columns were doubtless of wood. No certain evidence of roofing was found, but an archaic votive offering of limestone in the shape of a dwelling house with a hipped roof suggests that the temple roof may have been of this type. During the years 700-550 B.C. extensive improvements were made in the pre- cinct. The bed of the Imbrasus branch was moved to the west, and where the brook had run was built a colonnade 70 m. long, with 58 wooden columns in two rows. Near the shore, 17 m. from the south end of the colonnade, was constructed a rectangular reservoir, 2.14 x .82 m., fed through a bronze spout in the shape of a lion's head with a large frog upon it. Nearby, in the southeast angle of the precinct wall, a rectangular area, 10 x 8 m., was carefully paved, apparently for use at the annual ceremonial bath of the image. A cistern near this area may have been used to supply water for the irrigation of the sacred agnus castus near which the rude image had been found. A new hecatompedon was built on the site of the first, of the same dimensions and arrangements, except that there were no interior columns. From the eastern front of the temple a new paved street with a propylon led toward the city. Along this street were found many bases of votive offerings; chief among them were bronze cauldrons. Statues were set up in the precinct as early as the end of the seventh century B.C. In the decade before 550 B.C. the great dipteral temple was built under the direc- tion of the Samian architects Rhoecus and Theodorus. These two brothers were also famous as workers in bronze. Theodorus invented a lathe with which he turned the turbines of the columns of the "Labyrinth." This "Labyrinth" Klein in 1885 identified with the great temple of Hera, because Pliny says that it was in Samos and i' XLivatn. This identification is probably correct.</page><page sequence="7">176 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXV, 1931 Pliny adds that the "Labyrinth" had 150 columns and that some of the turbines were still in existence in his day. The great temple of Rhoecus and Theodorus had 134 columns, and a later restoration, 155 columns, numbers which are not far from 150. Furthermore, many fragmentary trochili belonging to the bases of the columns were unmistakably turned on a lathe. Theodorus, who wrote a work about the Hera temple, may have given it the name " Labyrinth" because the building, the first colossal temple in Ionia, was conceived in rivalry with Oriental structures of many columns, including Egyptian "Labyrinths." The temple, built on the site of the two earlier peripteral structures, was 200 cubits long and 100 cubits wide. The double peristyle ran completely around the temple, which was decastyle at the west end and octastyle at the east. The intercolumniations directly in front of the pronaos were greater than the others. There were two rows of interior columns, of five each in the pronaos and ten each in the cella proper. In contrast with the normal Doric temple, the outer row of columns of the peristyle was nearly 10 feet from the edge of the stylobate, and the crepidoma had two, rather than three steps, both of them low (about 9 inches in height). The majority of the column bases, which were of hard limestone, were found, entire or in frag- ments, in the foundation of a later restoration. The horizontal channeling of tori and trochili, which was done on a lathe, shows a variety of patterns and a precision of execution which make them without a parallel in Greek art. The columns were of brown porus; the flutings are shallow and in some drums are entirely lack- ing. Of walls and entablature nothing remains. Many clay roof tiles were found, and the fragment of a porus acroterion. In front of the temple was built a porus altar about 100 feet broad. It was approximately on the site of the earlier altar of ashes, for which it served as a colossal base. Rhoecus and Theodorus extended the limits of the Heraeum by filling the bed of the Imbrasus branch. Near the sacred spot marked by the reservoir and the square paved area near the shore they built a peripteral structure, 46 x 23 m., without columns at the east end and open in front. The cella was arranged like that of the first Hera temple, with a single row of interior columns, 8 in the east chamber and 5 in the west. This building may have been the Odeum mentioned in the fourth-century treasury list. Near the northeast edge of the precinct a colonnade was built, 200 x 20 feet (1 foot=29.6 cm.). An architectural block found nearby shows a cutting for the metal dowel with a channel for pouring in the molten lead. This is the earliest example of this technique, which may there- fore have been invented by the Samian architects. The architectural plans of Rhoecus and Theodorus were not fully carried out when Polycrates became tyrant of Samos. The great temple was soon destroyed by fire. Its restoration was begun at once, and was continued by the successors of Alexander, but was never completed. In Strabo's time it was used as a pina- cotheca. The cult images were removed to two smaller temples of marble, built probably before the second century A.D. On the ruins of these arose later a Christian basilica. SCULPTURE The Acroteria and Pediments of the Oldest Temples of Athena on the Acropolis of Athens.-A further step, and perhaps a more conclusive one than its pred- ecessors, has been taken by H. SCHRADER in the elucidation of the fragments of large marble and poros sculptures from the sixth-century temples on the Acropolis. To find place for all the existing pieces it is necessary to assume the existence of two buildings, as suggested by Heberdey, very nearly contemporary and very similar in size, each having as a central acroterion a running Gorgon flanked by</page><page sequence="8">GREEK PAINTING] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1930 177 a pair of beasts, lions or panthers, and no corner acroteria except the large scrolls in which the upper band of the pediment sima terminates. The smaller of the two buildings was the old temple of Athena, the original Hecatompedon, whose foundations are visible to the south of the Erechtheum together with those of a peripteron which was later built around it. The remains of two pediment groups in marble, a gigantomachia and a pair of lions subduing a bull, belong to this outer enclosing building, while the poros figures of which fragments remain belong to the two earlier temples, with their pediment cornices of poros. To the Heca- tompedon belong: (1) the Triton-Typhon group and (2) the pair of serpents, possibly with a lost figure of Athena between them; to the slightly larger temple, (1) a pair of lions slaying a bull and (2) the lioness with a bull-calf faced by a lion. In each of these two buildings one pediment is decidedly more advanced in style than the other, the Triton-Typhon group and the group of two lions being more plastic and true to nature than the others, which retain the early, flat, decorative character. In view of the close similarity of the ornamental simas, this difference of the pediments can only be accounted for by assuming that in each building the two pediments were assigned separately to an older and a younger generation of artists. The position of the larger of these two contemporary temples is uncertain, but it may have stood on the site of the present Parthenon and have been de- stroyed when the foundations were begun for the great pre-Persian Parthenon, which was never finished. Its remains were found in the filling by which the southern slope of the top of the hill was leveled up for this purpose. This earliest Parthenon, which alone would have been visible from the old city lying south of the hill, had three columns in antis on the front, while the Hecatompedon, farther to the north, had two columns in antis. In both, the gutter-fronts along the sides as well as on the gables were of thin, plank-like slabs of marble, and the acroteria were similar, like reliefs with the background cut away. Gorgons and Gorgoneia.-In Arch. Eph. 1927-1928 (issued in 1929), pp. 8-41, SPYRIDON MARINATOS discusses Gorgons and Gorgoneia. The terra-cotta frag- ment from Palaiokastro, recently held by Pfuhl to be Minoan, is assigned to the archaic period and interpreted as a part of a running Gorgon. Gorgons of this period have been found in places where the Minoan-Mycenaean traditions were strong, for early Greece inherited the Gorgon full-fledged from the Cretan- Mycenaean epoch. The ugly apotropaic face of the Gorgon originates in the Bronze Age and is derived from one or another phase of the Minoan chthonic goddess. In the archaic period the conception of the Gorgon is blended with that of the w7rroTa Oqpco until separate ideas of the Gorgons and of Artemis became established. The Three Graces.-In R. Arch. xxxi, pp. 274-332, W. DEONNA describes the two methods anciently employed in representing the three Graces. The earlier method, followed in Greece down to Roman times, shows them as three young women side by side, resting or advancing, always fully clothed, and facing the spectator. In the Greco-Roman period, however, they appear nude; one turns her back to the spectator, and instead of having no connection with one another, as in the former type, they are closely interlaced. Deonna has under- taken to complete the list of Jahn, and has shown how the latter type has been perpetuated in art down to our times. VASES AND PAINTING Aryballos.-In B.S.A. xxix, session 1927-1928, pp. 187-215 (2 pls.; 10 figs.), J. D. BEAZLEY publishes a small round aryballus in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. It is said to have been found at Athens. Probably an Athenian would</page><page sequence="9">178 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXV, 1931 have called such a vase a X'KL:os. On this vase four boys are seen playing with miniature chariots which are equipped with palm branches as sails. The game was like the toy yacht-racing of our time. Miniature chariots are often depicted on red-figured vases. On the shoulder of this vase are two panthers, and on the rim of the mouth the inscription 'Irro5a'da KaXb;. The style warrants the attribution to Makron. There are two main types of aryballi: the Corinthian, with a broad, disc-like mouth; and the Attic, with a narrow, hemi- spherical mouth. The former appears shortly after the middle of the seventh century and is common in Corinthian pottery and other wares. This type dis- appears from Attic vases about 520 B.c., after which the Attic type prevails exclusively. Vases of Corinthian type (and variants), but presumably of Attic manufacture, are listed, and a detailed catalogue of the twenty-one known clay vases of the Attic type is given, to which are added two examples of limestone, one of faience, and one of bronze (with nine further vases of a somewhat different shape). Variations from the regular type are discussed. Early Greek Vases from Cnossus.-In B.S.A. xxix, session 1927-1928, pp. 224-298 (26 pls.; 42 figs.), H. G. G. PAYNE publishes some early Greek vases found in a tomb at Cnossus excavated in 1927. The tomb is of Minoan date, as are others of the same type belonging to the same group and still others excavated by Sir Arthur Evans in 1907 and D. G. Hogarth in 1899. The earliest vases are Sub-Mycenaean or Proto-Geometric, the latest orientalizing of the seventh cen- tury. The tomb, roughly circular with a dromos, was used for many successive interments. The earliest vases were found in the chamber, the latest in the dromos. Evidently the chamber was used until it was filled, then the dromos. The series of vases is very rich, and many shapes are represented. The Proto- Geometric vases belong to the time immediately before the introduction of the Geometric style. The Geometric vases are better pottery but show little pro- gressive development in style of decoration. The vases decorated with white on a black ground are fairly numerous; this method of decoration seems to be peculiar to Crete. Of the orientalizing vases some are decorated in the same technique as the Geometric vases, others are polychrome. The latter belong chiefly to the seventh century and show extensive knowledge of new ideas of decoration, as well as ability in the use of them. The influence of Cyprus appears, but the decoration is, nevertheless, essentially Greek. The tombs and vases are described in detail, and the types and patterns used in decoration are considered in relation to the art of other regions. How the Aryballus was Suspended.-In B.S.A. xxix, session 1927-1928, pp. 216-223 (pl.; 4 figs.), C. H. EMILIE HASPELS discusses and illustrates the methods of suspending the aryballus. The Corinthian type was suspended by a string passed through its handle, the Attic type by a string tied round its neck. The string might be combined with a leather band carried around the wrist or in the hand, or leather bands sometimes were used instead of the string. This last is the method usually depicted on archaic red-figured vases; but strings are more com- mon both earlier and later. Note on a Laconian Oenochoe.-In B.S.A. xxix, session 1927-1928, pp. 108-112 (fig.), E. TANKARD ascribesto the same painter: (1) the Krater in the Louvre, E661, (2) the Laconian oenochoe, B.S.A. xxviii, pl. VII, (3) the cylix in the Louvre, E667, and (4) the cylix from Naucratis, British Museum, B4. The first is a fine example of the best Laconian vase painting in the third period, the last belongs to the fourth period. The series shows the gradual deterioration in the sixth century. The interpretation of the interior painting of the Naucratis cylix as the nymph Cyrene is rendered less probable by the proof of the Laconian descent of the cylix.</page><page sequence="10">GREEK INSCRIP.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1930 179 On Photographing Greek Vases.-The disturbing effect of reflections from the polished surface of Greek vases when they are photographed in a strong light can be prevented if the light, instead of coming from one direction, is evenly diffused about the object. An apparatus to accomplish this, a "light-box," in which small electric bulbs are distributed around the edges and the light admitted only indi- rectly to the object in the centre, has been devised by E. LANGLOTZ, and is de- scribed in Arch. Anz. 1928, pt. 1/2, cols. 94-101 (7 figs.). INSCRIPTIONS Additional Inscriptions from the Amphiareion.--In Arch. Eph. 1925-1926 (issued in 1929), pp. 9-45, B. LEONARDOS continues his publication of inscriptions from the Amphiareion. Of the 28 inscriptions (numbers 127-155) discussed in this issue, the first two are dedications of the custodian of the temple, ten are honorary inscriptions granting the privilege of proxenia, thirteen record victorious contestants, two are from the bases of statues, and one is a law relating to the sacred precinct. In addition to the inscriptions were found five abakes used in reckoning. Delian Inscriptions.-Two Athenian Families.-In B.C. H. liii (1929), pp. 166-184 (pl. V; 7 figs.) P. ROUSSEL discusses the families of the Pyrrhakidae and the Erysichthonidae, who appear on inscriptions, both at Delos and at Delphi. In 1906 the late G. Leroux, in excavating a paved area southeast of the Agora Tetragone, discovered a circular monument, the bottom of which was sunk below the level of the pavement. It was hollow, and its bottom, too, was paved, and on the top course of its inner face it bore the inscription, Tptwrr-7rwp hv'ppaKti v A-yLXLc&amp;v. From the presence of ashes and fragments of charred bone found above the paved bottom, it was obviously an altar for sacrifice. A similar monu- ment, less well preserved, was found in 1911 to the southwest of the reservoir of the Inopus, north of and below the Kabeirion. An inscription, similarly placed, shows that this was dedicated to the Nymphs by this same family. These two monuments are unique, although there are two others at Delos (in the Kabeirion, and in front of the grotto of Cynthus), an archaic altar at Didyma, and one at Agrigentum, that are not unlike them. These inscriptions make the presence of this family of the Pyrrhakidae at Delos known to us for the first time, although they appear fairly often at Delphi. The first monument is dedicated to a remote an- cestor, and was probably erected, about the time of the purification of 426, on the supposed site of his tomb. The name A-LXuy v refers, in all probability, to the Attic deme of that name, the exact location of which is in doubt, but which was probably situated south of Cape Zoster, where a temple of Apollo has recently been uncovered. The presence of the Erysichthonidae at Delos is known by two inscriptions, previously published by Wilhelm in Anzeiger Wien. A kad., for 1924. These stones date in the first century B.c., and are supplemented by two others, previously unpublished and made known here for the first time, referring to the same persons, on one of which the family name is given, as being the Erysichthoni- dae. The founder of this family, Erysichthon, is reputed by ancient mythology to have founded the earliest sanctuary at Delos, and set up the first statue of Apollo. This family is connected with the Attic deme of Prasiae. Inscription from Philia.-In Arch. Eph. 1927-1928 (published in 1929), pp. 119-127, NIKOLAOS I. GIANNOPOULOS discusses an inscription which was found during the war by a Greek general in the village of Philia, two hours southeast of Karditsa. The inscription is written in two columns, one of which is broader than the other, on the front face of a marble block. It records a decision rendered by judges who came from Colophon, Samos, and Magnesia on the Maiander at the summons of the Thessalian state, in 178-172 B.c., to settle a boundary dispute</page><page sequence="11">180 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXV, 1931 between the Meliteians and Lamians, but was not erected until some seventy years later. This is the fourth record of the boundary disputes of the Meliteians. Inscriptions from Sparta.-In B.S.A. xxix, session 1927-1928, pp. 1-56, A. M. WOODWARD publishes and discusses inscriptions found at the theatre and on the acropolis of Sparta in 1924-1927, comprising: (1) the remainder of those belonging to the series inscribed on the East Parodos Wall (with a revised and am- plified analysis of the series), (2) the further lists of Ephors and Nomophylakes found in 1927 in clearing the Orchestra-drain westwards, (3) the lists of magis- trates and single tenures of office, (4) statue-bases of officials and athletes, (5) miscellaneous documents, including dedications, fragmentary decrees, and a list of Spartan names of the fourth century B.C. Some of the persons mentioned in these inscriptions are already known. One inscription is a duplicate of I.G. V, i, 547, another is on the base of a statue erected in honor of Publilius Optatianus (Porfy- rius), whose verses are preserved, and who was praefectus urbi A.D. 329 and 333. He is here described as proconsul of Achaia. A fragmentary metrical boustrophe- don inscription, dating from before 500 B.C., is a dedication, presumably a hymn, to Athena, possibly by a poet of note, such as Alcman or Gitiadas. Magnesian Epigraphical Notes.-A. OGUSE contributes, in B.C.H. liii (1929), pp. 129-150, discussions of five inscriptions from Magnesia, and one from Miletus. The five from Magnesia are all published by Kern (nos. 79, 50, 62, 101 and 64) and copious commentaries, emendations, and corrections are given, particulaily for no. 79. The one from Miletus is published in Das Delphinion in Milet, no. 33. It, too, is given a long and detailed commentary, with emendations and changes. Notes on Hellenistic Epigraphy.-Louis ROBERT, in B.C.H. liii (1929), pp. 151-165, contributes the sixth of his articles on this subject. (See ibid., 1924, pp. 331-342; 1925, pp. 219-238; 1926, pp. 469-522; 1928, pp. 158-172, 426-443.) The groups selected for study here bear the numbers XXXIV and XXXV. The first is an inscription from Pergamon, where a number of corrections are made to the previous publication; the second consists of a group of four inscriptions from Boeotia and Phocis (decrees of Tanagra, Thespiae, and Delphi, and an arbitration agreement between Halae and Boumelita). All of these inscriptions have been published before; their importance is commented upon, and numerous corrections and emendations are given. ITALY GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Campanian Topography.-In A. J. P. li, 4 (1930), pp. 378-381, A. W. VAN BU- REN amends the texts of two sources for Campanian topography: Statius, Silvae IIl, 5, 104, and Florus II.8.4. Vergil and Astronomy.-In R. Arch. xxxi, pp. 246-252, PIERRE-MAXIME SCHUHL suggests an explanation for Vergil, Ecl. IV.50: Adspice convexo nutantem pondere mundum. Schuhl stresses the poet's interest in astronomy and suggests that he may have learned of the planitaire from either Posidonius or Publius Nigi- dius Figulus. The verse of the Eclogue may, he believes, refer to a potter's wheel employed for astronomical purposes. SCULPTURE Flavian Portrait Heads in Leningrad.-Two female portrait heads, one in the Hermitage Museum and one in the Academy of Art of Leningrad, are published by L. PUSHNIKOFF in Arch. Anz. 1929, pt. 1/2 (cols. 38-43; 6 figs.). Both have the high mass of curled hair surrounding the forehead that is characteristic of female portraits of the time of Trajan, but in every other respect they are strongly con-</page><page sequence="12">FRANCE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1930 181 trasted. The Hermitage head is that of a middle-aged woman with diadem above the frisure, and is executed with the extreme hardness of Roman work of that pe- riod. The other and smaller head, of Greek marble, shows, in delicacy of outline and softness of treatment, the influence of the old Greek idealizing marble technique. A Masterpiece of Late Roman Baroque.-The large marble sarcophagus with battle scenes, in the Ludovisi collection of the National Museum at Rome, together with a sarcophagus cover which has been in the Museum at Maintz since 1916, was discussed and illustrated by G. RODENWALDT at the June (1928) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society. The likeness of the two pieces in material, dimensions, subject, and style, even to their both having a portrait figure of the same distinguished but as yet nameless general, indicates that they belong to- gether. They are exceptionally fine work, of the end of Caracalla's reign or that of Elagabalus. Arch. Anz. 1928, pt. 1/2, cols. 266-268. VASES AND PAINTING Diatreta.-The only two references in Latin literature to diatreta pocula, pierced cups, are in Martial and the Digest and speak of them only as very precious and fragile articles, but give no information as to their material or appearance. The passages have been variously interpreted as referring to glass vases covered with a network of glass threads and to vases cut out of semi-precious stone. To these must be added two references in a nearly contemporary Greek commentary on the Digest, in which the material is called M0ox, stone, without any qualifying adjective, and several in the Midrash, the Hebrew commentary on the Bible, in which the name is transliterated into Hebrew and refers apparently to glass vessels with a smooth reflecting surface. The inference may be drawn that the term originally referred to cups made like cameos, with designs cut into the different colored layers of a stone, and that it came to mean later any very costly drinking vessel made to imitate such vases. 0. LEMEL, R. ZAHN, Arch. Anz. 1928, pt. 3/4, cols. 563-570. Greek Vases from Centuripe.-In Metr. Mus. Studies, ii, 2, pp. 187-205 (1 pl.; 16 figs.), GISELA M. A. RICHTER discusses four examples of polychrome vases from Centuripe, in Sicily. They are bowls and kraters on high feet with domed covers terminating in large finials, and are decorated with friezes and bands in relief and by painted scenes with human figures. The ware dates probably in the second or the first century B.c., and its purpose seems to have been funerary. Because of the fragility of these vases and the friability of the colors, specimens are scarce and their state of preservation usually poor. Landscape in Hellenistic and Roman Art.-In Arta ?i Arheologia, iii, 5/6 (1930), pp. 34-44, MINODORA IGNAT discusses the use of landscape in ancient art. After the Hellenistic period begins, landscape appears more frequently, but it is always decorative, and decorative only. Painting uses this feature more than sculpture, but after the Christian era painting fades before the new art of frescoing, which is prominent especially in Pompeii and at Herculaneum. We find traces of landscape also in mosaics. Christian art added a type of symbolism, but at bottom it rests upon Hellenistic art. Byzantine treatment is based on the fusion of Christianity, Hellenism, and Oriental features. FRANCE Megalithic Monuments of Quiberon.-In Arta i Arheologia, iii, 5/6 (1930), pp. 24-33, P. CONSTANTINESCU-IAs I reviews the material available for the history of the megalithic monuments on the peninsula of Quiberon in Brittany. During</page><page sequence="13">182 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XXXV, 1931 1929 he made a new study of them and also of the d'bris remaining from others already destroyed. He was able to add several to those marked on the map of le Rouzic, Director of the Museum of Carnac, and he describes in detail the four monuments which are still in good condition, the menhirs of Mane Meur and of Conguel, and the circle and the cromlech of St. Pierre Quiberon. GERMANY The Collections of Antiquities in Munich.-An account of changes which have taken place since 1918 in the arrangement and contents of the Glyptotek, espe- cially as the result of removing the modern sculpture to a separate museum, by P. VOLTERS, and a descriptive list of the additions to the Museum of Minor Antiquities, by J. SIEVEKING, are published in Arch. Anz. 1929, pt. 1/2 (cols. li-37; 33 figs.). Among the objects illustrated are the statue of an old woman clasp ng a wine-jug, by the younger Myron, a head of Asclepius and one of Jupiter, from Rome, a Hellenistic portrait head, some unusual small bronzes, including a ram's head with inlaid eyes and a caricatured athlete's head, a diminutive caricature of a helmeted warrior, in terra cotta, odd vases in the form of a prostrate youth, a child's head, and a pig decorated with knobs of colored glass, a jar with leaves in high relief covering the body, three small Proto-Corinthian spherical vases, an Athenian lutrophorus and two lecythi, several vases from southern Italy, among them a guttus painted with guinea fowl, some exquisite gold jewelry, and a piece of Egyptian faience in the form of a baboon. The Kestner Collection in Hannover.-August Kestner, who lived in Rome from 1817 to 1849, as secretary and afterwards head of the Hannoverian legation there, was a friend of the archaeologists of the period, of some of whom he made pencil and crayon portraits, and he made a collection of antiquities-bronzes, vases, engraved gems, etc.-which became the property of the city of Hannover in 1889. Some of the objects are illustrated and described and five of the portraits published by C. KUETHMANN in Arch. Anz. 1928, pt. 3/4 (cols. 678-698; 19 figs.). Among these are six small Etruscan bronze statuettes (a centaur with full human figure in front, wearing a ribbed wig and a Cretan apron, of the seventh century; a female flute player and a dancer, evidently a pair, of the sixth century; an archaic reclin- ing youth, probably an ornament on some bronze vessel; a warrior charging forward with drawn sword, probably part of a group, of the middle of the fifth century; and a graceful standing nude youth without attribute, of the late fifth century); thirty-four engraved gems and glass pastes (archaic Etruscan, Greco- Roman, Hellenistic-Roman, classicizing); and a unique aryballus of pale blue fa- ience, which seems to have been made in Egypt in the seventh century B.c. by a foreign workman. Roman Villas in the Rhineland.-Six or seven typical examples of country houses in the Gallo-Roman provinces of the Rhine, ranging from a one-room cot- tage built on the foundations of a La-Tene-period dwelling to a very elaborate castle-like structure, were described by F. OELMANN at the May (1928) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society, and illustrated by plans and reconstructions drawn by H. MYLIUS of Bonn. There seem to have been no villages in the usual sense of the word, unless the quarters of the retainers of a large establishment might be so called. Each household was an independent unit living in a single building on its own land. These buildings were enlarged and altered at various epochs, but the aesthetic effects of symmetry and contrast were everywhere observed, a long comparatively low facade with portico and projecting wings being the usual scheme.

Eph. 1927-1928 (issued in 1929), pp. 41-112, A. D. KERAMOPOULOS discusses the archaic necropolis of Trebenishte. Rejecting the theory of Filow that the graves of Trebenishte were those of Greek mercenaries and that few of the objects found in them were of local manufacture, and differing in part from the view of Fabricius (communicated to him in a letter), that the graves themselves as well as the treasure they contained resembled so closely the shaft-graves of Mycenae and their treasure that they must be assigned to descendants of Cadmus who had maintained uncontaminated for a thousand years the metallurgical traditions of their ancestors, he argues that the graves and their contents are to be assigned to Macedonians, who like their kinsmen in the south were descended from an indigenous Neolithic population blended with Achaeans and Dorians. He suspects that the graves were roofed, as at Rhitsona, and that in both places the dead were interred in wooden sarcophagi. Bronzes might have been imported not only from Corinth and Chalkis but also from Potidaia, across Macedonia. The works of gold and silver found in the tombs may well be assigned to the Macedonians themselves, who down to the time of Aemilius Paulus were famous for their vessels of precious metal. That gold masks were found in this northern region makes it necessary to revise the opinion that the gold masks of Mochlos and Mycenae were made under Egyptian influence. The dead here interred were probably Macedonian leaders who died in battle in the sixth century, a period of expansion of the Macedonian power toward the north. Few discoveries of recent years surpass in importance this of the necropolis of Treben- ishte, revealing as it does the wealth and artistic development of the Macedonians in this period. As an appendix to the article is published a tomb discovered in Ozolian Locris in 1928 in the course of road-construction near the ancient Myonia. The contents of the tomb, present analogies to the objects found in the Trebenishte graves, and argue for trade connections between the two regions in the sixth century. RUMANIA Remains of the Roman City of Tomis.-In Arta i Arheologia, iii, 5/6 (1930), pp. 52-55, 0. TAFRALI discusses remains seen in 1902 near Constanta, which appar- ently were those of the Roman city of Tomis. Quite close to the shore stood a building with a long sewer beneath it. An inscription was found that referred to the Apatouria celebrated here. This structure apparently belonged to the reign of Antoninus Pius or to that of Marcus Aurelius. Tombs and Other Structures in the Region of Tekirghiol-Urluchiol.-In Arta i Arheologia, iii, 5/6 (1930), pp. 56-59, 0. TAFRALI discusses two barbarian cities found in the region near Constanta and Tomis. There are mounds and fortifica- tions exactly as in Mangalia, the Greek city of Callatis. He also discusses the first beehive tomb discovered in Rumania. The remains surveyed are from the same population which inhabited Scythia Minor from the fourth century B.c. to the second century A.D., and which built the tombs of Callatis. Vases.-In Arta ?i Arheologia, iii, 5/6 (1930), pp. 45-51, 0. TAFRALI and I. L. NEAGU discuss certain inscriptions on a few Greek vases in the Museum of Antiq- uities at Iagi and also a series of large vases from Vartiscoi. These latter are of the type of La Thne II and III, and they are especially interesting in that they ap- parently belong as late as the third and the fourth century A.D., and thus afford striking evidence of the continuation of this type. The collection of barbaric vases at Iayi is now the most complete in Rumania.</page><page sequence="15">184 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL.

Studies in the Stone Age Settlements in the Podlasie.-In Bull. Arch. Polonais, x (1929), pp. 36-117 (figs.), ZYGMUNT SZMIT discusses very fully several Stone Age settlements along the River Bug in Podlasie. Some settlements show Late Mag- dalenian culture, others pure Tardenois, still others Eastern Baltic. A Neolithic station was left at Czerwony Borek. RUSSIA The Ancient Pantikapaion.-In Publications of the Azerbaijan Governmental Scientific Research Institute, Archaeology and Ethnology, iii, pp. 306-315, Y. Y. MARTI reviews what is known of the ancient Pantikapaion, the city of Mith- ridates. He discusses the topography as shown by the maps of Du Brux, of Blaramberg, of Ashik and of other scholars and travellers. Much has been accomplished in the matter of locating the walls, streets, etc. The growth of the modern city of Kerch, however, renders necessary a systematic excavation, which ought to be commenced immediately. Although this site has been known for over a hundred years, little has been done to follow up such detailed knowledge as has been available. Preservation of Prehistoric Remains.-In Bull. Arch. Polonais, x (1929), pp. 129-144, BOLESLAW BREZGO discusses the forces that since the World War have made either for the conservation or, on the other hand, the destruction of antiquities in the government of Vitebsk and in Polish Latvia. The Ruins at Kitey.-In Publications of the Azerbaijan Governmental Scientific Research Institute, Archaeology and Ethnology, iii, pp. 1-15, Y. Y. MARTI discusses the remains in the city of Kitey, a small fortress on the Cimmerian Bosporus. On the basis of the ceramic evidence it has been concluded that this site was oc- cupied from the fifth century B.c. to the fifth century A.D. A double line of forti- fication walls exists on the east side of the city, a number of towers are attached to this stronghold, pits used for the storage of grain have been located, a catacomb seemingly used from the second century A.D. shows wall decorations. Having previously been a Greco-Scythian community, the city later became Greco- Sarmatian, as is shown by the inscriptions. NORWAY A North Scandinavian Palaeolithicum?-In Fortvdnnen, 1929, 4, GUNNAR EKHOLM discusses the very comprehensive theme of Palaeolithic culture in north- ern Norway. Going even farther than the point to which Montelius pressed in his argument that more than 15,000 years ago settlers penetrated to the receding ice boundary in the Baltic regions, certain recent writers on this subject argue that man was in Scandinavia during the last interglacial period. In fact an implement discovered in Jutland in 1905 seems to prove such a contention. Dr. Nummedal, in an effort to establish the chronology of certain objects found on the coast of Norway, consisting of axes and other small implements, concludes that the oldest of the cultures represented by these various finds is an off-shoot of the western European Late Palaeolithic. Discoveries at several places, some of which lie at an altitude of 57 m., suggest the mark of an ancient shore-line. Other investigators of this problem, Dr. Anathon BjBrn, for instance, are somewhat in- clined towards the belief that there existed a continuous habitation in these regions</page><page sequence="16">SWEDEN] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1930 185 from the interglacial times, although he can see some disturbing factors in such a theory. Bj6rn's hypothesis is that the civilization in the Finnmark evidences a migration, which, coming from Asia, reached the Scandinavian peninsula early in the post-arctic era. In support of this bold contention that immigration did not come from the south but rather from the east, attention is called to the fact that the ice melted concentrically. This explanation of the migration movements, if sustained, may contain an explanation of some of Norway's peculiar anthro- pological conditions. Ekholm does not accept these views. He thinks that the objects mentioned are Mesolithic, not Palaeolithic. The conclusions that we are justified in drawing at present, furthermore, rather point in the direction of a connection between this northern culture and Europe than with Asia. Northern Sweden has already begun to be a suggestive field for similar investigations on this problem. SWEDEN Implements of the Maglemose Epoch.-In Fornvdnnen, 1929, 3, OTTO RYDBECK discusses certain implements bearing on the Maglemose period. Danish archae- ologists have insisted that the culture bearers of the so-called klokkenmiddinger epoch do not seem sufficiently different from the Maglemose to warrant the assump- tion that they were immigrants. A find from SkAne, Sweden, made in 1927, is a significant addition to the objects previously available for the study of this ques- tion. This discovery, which belongs to the time of mixed oak forests, is an axe with handle hole and fashioned out of the antler of a stag. The article by Ryd- beck describes a very thoroughgoing examination of this axe in comparison with other objects of about the same period. Rock Carvings in Relation to Agricultural Rites.-In Fornvdnnen, 1930, 1, pp. 1-24 (11 figs.), AXEL W. PERSSON observes that we have the right to assume that along with the oldest species of grain coming from the Orient, there came simultaneously a certain amount of knowledge of how to handle the grain and to promote good harvests. Now on the basis of Professor O. Almgren's work, Hdllristningar och Kultbruk ('Rock Carvings and Agricultural Rites'), Persson makes a study which tends to clear up many obscure points with reference to the religious significance of the rock carvings. The figures on the carvings playing a prominent part in the ceremonies have always been described as being equipped with swords fixed to their bodies. The author of this article assumes that these features are not really swords, but tails. His argument gains plausibility from the consideration that all figures with horns are equipped with such tails. The human beings participating in the ceremonies depicted are regarded by this new interpretation to be dressed in the hides of animals. Several religious cultures afford examples of just such a practice. In the case of the Scandinavian rock carvings the skin of the reindeer seems to be employed exclusively, a detail which the author regards as natural and significant by reason of the intimate association of this animal with the magic features of the cult of fertility. The article introduces certain parallels between sun worship represented in the rock carvings and analogous features on Greek vases. Certain demoniacal beings of classical rites-the corybantes and the satyrs with tails--stand in a direct relation to religious rites and ceremonies. With reference to the position of the worship- pers, many parallels are found in the practices of peoples of Asia Minor, of Greece, and of Rome. Persson rejects the assumption of real figures of deities as well for the rock carvings as for the Cretan-Mycenaean religion by stressing the possibility of interpreting certain figures as epiphanous representations. In regard to the perplexing problem of the dlvkvarn (small round hollows in the rock), the</page><page sequence="17">186 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXV, 1931 author is non-committal. But some of them, because of their position in the carv- ings, seem to indicate excrementa, he feels. Certain drawings of a streaked, net- like form he considers representations of clouds and thus closely connected with agricultural rites and the magic of worship. GREAT BRITAIN Hill-Forts.-In Antiquity, v, 17 (1931), pp. 60-97 (14 figs.), CH. HAWKES gives a long and valuable "retrospect" of British hill-forts, with an appendix listing all the hill-forts furnishing evidence of Early Iron Age date. NORTHERN AFRICA The Palaeolithic Age of Africa Minor.-In R. Arch. xxxi, pp. 253-273, H. OBER- MAIER discusses the Palaeolithic remains of the territory which extends from the Atlantic to Egypt and which is bordered on the north by the Mediterranean and on the south by the Sahara. After discussing evidences of glaciation in the mountainous regions, he remarks that in the other districts of Africa Minor man of the quartenary period enjoyed a much more humid climate than today. The fauna of the quartenary period in these districts is remarkable for its dis- tinctly African character, and all its specimens still live with the exception of the bear, which emigrated during the Middle Ages. The larger part of the article is devoted to a discussion of the Paleolithic finds in Africa Minor: first to be treated is Le paleolithique inftrieur, then Le paleolithique superieur, and finally the rock pictures. Obermaier concludes that our evidence points to the existence of a highly developed paleolithique superieur, that is, of a Capsian civilization, contem- poraneous with the Aurignacian, the Solutrian, and the Magdalenian of western and central Europe; the ancient Paleolithic Age of Africa Minor takes a position within the great European divisions of the Chellian, of the Acheulian, and of the Mousterian, and it is unlikely that between this age in Africa and the same age in Europe there are any considerable chronological differences; the western Mediter- ranean district formed at this time a true cultural and geographical unit. EARLY CHRISTIAN, BYZANTINE AND MEDIAEVAL GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Apocalyptic Visions in Byzantine Art.-In Arta ?i Arheologia, ii, 4 (1930), pp. 1-10, Louis BRJHIER points out the differences in the attitude of the churches of the East and the West towards the Apocalypse and the resulting differences in ecclesiastical art. In the West, where the Apocalypse was early accepted, we find many cases of the apocalyptic visions, Christ surrounded by the symbols of the Four Evangelists. These were developed into a portion of history which was expressed in many places and found a natural place before the scenes of the Last Judgment. Byzantine Art, where the Apocalypse was not so willingly accepted, has laid stress primarily on the timeless nature of the Faith, and as such the great figures in the apses are those of the Pantokrator and the intercession of the Mother of God, themes not based primarily upon the Apocalypse. Visions are excluded. The official iconography has put its seal of approval upon those scenes which can be interpreted symbolically to strengthen the Eucharistic teaching. Some of the monastic systems of iconography, however, do give some attention to apocalyptic scenes. Finally, in Egypt and in Syria the visions of the prophets and of St. John were represented in the apses of the churches as an illustration of the Eucharistic prayer. Coptic Tunics.-In Metr. Mus. Studies, ii, 2, pp. 239-252 (19 figs.), M. S. DIMAND discusses Coptic mortuary tunics, using as illustrations linen and woolen</page><page sequence="18">EARLY CHRISTIAN] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1930 187 garments now in the Metropolitan Museum. He discusses the development from the Hellenistic to the Copto-Oriental style in the weavers art from the fourth to the seventh century as shown by the tapestry-woven and embroidered decorations of the clavi, neck borders, and sleeve bands. EGYPT A Textile in the Museo Cristiano.-In Art Bulletin, xii (1930), pp. 115-130 (23 figs.), L. D. LONGMAN makes an iconographic and stylistic study of the two fragments of a textile in the Sancta Sanctorum treasury of the Vatican, the prove- nance and date of which have never been precisely determined, though the frag- ments are well known. The Annunciation and the Nativity are represented on the two fragments. Comparison of the ornaments and of the figure compositions with other Early Christian monuments in various media-textile, ivory, and miniature-point to Alexandria as the provenance of the fragments and to the first half of the sixth century as the period in which they were made. SYRIA AND PALESTINE A Bronze Situla in the Museo Cristiano.-In Art Bulletin, xii (1930), pp. 163- 178 (33 figs.), W. L. M. BURKE publishes a bronze situla in the Museo Cristiano which offers interesting material for stylistic study. Between two palmette borders is represented Christ in the midst of His apostles, each figure separated by a conventionalized palm tree. A study of the "Teaching" and "Mission" motives as shown on sarcophagi, in the Catacomb frescoes, and in Apse mosaics, proves that the situla subject does not agree precisely with any of the types of "Teaching" or "Mission," though the motive of Christ teaching His disciples is apparently here intended. There is a close relation to the "City-Gate " sarcoph- agi, and the work of the situla may be assigned like those sarcophagi to a Graeco- Asiatic atelier and to the end of the fourth century or earlier half of the fifth. ITALY Some Cave-Chapels of Southern Italy.-In publishing some of the fast-vanish- ing evidence of the once widespread monastic life of Byzantine origin, especially the beautifully frescoed underground chapels, in Southern Italy, G. ROBINSON emphasizes the Greek character of the civilization of the region from the earliest times, even the Brutii being probably of Greek stock, while the Greek language continued in use and the Greek form of Christian worship survived there down to the Renaissance. In very early Christian times monks and hermits began to come over to Magna Graecia from Egypt and Syria as well as from the Byzantine Empire, and in the succeeding centuries not only many magnificent monasteries were built, but communities of monks lived in caves, either natural or artificial, each group, or laura, having its more or less elaborate grotto chapel. With ad- equate exploration and study, a great deal could be learned about the still obscure history, archaeology, and culture of the country. A Societ" Magna Grecia has been formed for this purpose, under the presidency of Professor Orsi, and it is pro- posed to supplement its work by an allied Societh Bizantina. J.H.S. 1, 1930, pt. ii, pp. 186-209 (3 pls.; 12 figs.); p. 328. A Sculpture by Wiligelmus.-In L'Arte, xxxiii (1930), pp. 255-256 (3 figs.), Z. BONACINI published a relief of the enthroned Madonna and Child which he attributes to Wiligelmus. The present ownership of the piece is not mentioned, but the author says that precise knowledge of the provenance of the work (also not here reported) supports his attribution, which is based primarily upon the stylis-</page><page sequence="19">188 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXV, 1931 tic relationship of the work, to the Wiligelmus reliefs on the faqade of Modena Cathedral. The Madonna relief would seem to be contemporary with these or slightly later. Siculo-Arabic Ivories in the Museo Cristiano.-In Art Bulletin, xii (1930), pp. 131-146 (24 figs.), P. B. COTT studies the problems of the provenance and date of a group of ivory objects in the Museo Cristiano consisting of two caskets, a pyxis, and two croziers. For the style of the painted decorations, half conven- tional, half naturalistic, parallels are offered by ivory croziers and caskets, textiles, and especially the painted ceiling of the Cappella Palatina in Palermo. All these comparisons contribute to a refutation of a Syrian or Mesopotamian provenance and support the theory that the Museo Cristiano objects were made in Sicily by Mohammedan artists. The date must be the second half of the twelfth century, when the Christian religion was strong in Sicily, for the croziers could have been done only for Christian use. A Group of Italo-Byzantine Ivories.-In the analysis of a group of ivories in the Museo Cristiano, A. S. KECK, in Art Bulletin, xii (1930), pp. 147-162 (27 figs.), makes a study of Italian ivory carving derived from the Byzantine style. The characteristics of this somewhat degenerate derivative style are definitely deter- mined; Venice is found to be the seat of the ateliers for this Italo-Byzantine production; and the period in which the ateliers flourished proves to be the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The Roman School at Assisi.-In Art Bulletin, xii (1930), pp. 270-300 (45 figs.), A. NICHOLSON makes a detailed study of the frescoes of the Upper Church of S. Francesco in Assisi (exclusive of the St. Francis cycle, which he considers the work of Giotto). The compositions that can be assigned to the Isaac Master show him to have been the greatest artist of the Roman school, though he was by no means so prolific as Cavallini. The rest of the work, though it exhibits here and there the influence of Cimabue, consists for the most part of repetitions of compositions standardized in and about Rome during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The work of the various artisans may be fairly distinctly grouped according to individual peculiarities that appear in spite of the satisfaction with established conceptions. Trecento Art in Romagna.-In Dedalo, 1930, pp. 197 ff. and 291 ff., L. Co- LETTI opposes van Marle's theory that the fundamental characteristics of the fourteenth-century Romagnola school are due to the influence of Cavallini. The formative influences are here assigned to Bernardo Daddi and the Ravenna mo- saics, aside from the obvious Giottesque influence. And the center of the school is shifted from Rimini to Ravenna. A Polyptych by Giotto.-In Dedalo, 1930, pp. 285 ff., R. LONGHI contributes to the studies which have resulted in the conclusion that the Horne St. Stephen and the Goldman Madonna are the work of Giotto and are parts of the same polyp- tych. The present author believes that there are two panels now attributed to Giuliano da Rimini in the Jacquemart-Andre collection that belong to the same polyptych. They are a magnificent figure of St. John and a less well preserved S. Lorenzo. The whole work is probably to be dated about 1320. Sienese Trecento Paintings.-In Dedalo, 1930, pp. 263 ff., B. BERENSON pub- lishes an imposing group of Sienese paintings of the fourteenth century the present location of which is unknown. Among the attributions are several important masters. The Altar-Frontal of the Florentine Baptistery.-In Pantheon, 1930, pp. 221 ff., C. G. E. BUNT traces the history, so far as it is known, of the silver altar-frontal of the Baptistery at Florence, from 1366 to 1480. In the conception of the whole</page><page sequence="20">EARLY CHRISTIAN] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1930 189 design he gives chief place to Leonardo di ser Giovanni, to whom he attributes en- tirely the four lower compartments. FRANCE Ivory Cross.-In R. Arch. xxxi, pp. 242-245, E. MAILLARD discusses an ivory cross in the Mus6e de Cluny, which was discovered in 1921 on the site of the an- cient abbey of Villeloin. The cross is to be dated about 1100, and has been added to the collection of three mediaeval ivories, of which also Maillard gives a de- scription. GERMANY Bamberg Miniatures of the Twelfth Century.-In Zeit. Bild. K. lxiv (1930), pp. 161-167 (7 figs.), E. LUTZE shows by a study of a group of twelfth-century illuminated manuscripts in the Bamberg State Library that the character of mediaeval Frankish miniature style is not so simple as Arthur Haseloff has repre- sented it to be. It is found to derive characteristics from Cologne, Regensburg, and Salzburg. German Romanesque Panel Painting.-In Miinch. Jb. vii (1930), pp. 125-181 (24 figs.), A. STRANGE discusses the general character of German panel painting during the Romanesque period and adds a catalogue of extant examples that amounts almost to a monograph, including, as it does, descriptions, and historical and iconographic discussions of the twenty-two items. The Cathedral at Regensburg.-With the help of old drawings in the treasury of the cathedral and elsewhere, K. ZAHN in Miinch. Jb. vi (1929), pp. 365-401 (20 figs.) studies the difficult problems connected with the west facade and the west portal of the cathedral at Regensburg. SWITZERLAND The Physiologus of Bern.-In Art Bulletin, xii (1930), pp. 226-253 (45 figs.), H. WOODRUFF makes a study of the miniatures of the Bern Physiologus, in which she sees a survival of the Alexandrian style in the ninth century. This version of the Physiologus is significant also in preserving, approximately, the original compositions, while all trace of the antique style and composition is lost in the next extant copy of the Physiologus, that of the tenth century at Brussels. RUMANIA The Monastery of Sucevila and Its Treasures.-In Arta gi Arheologia, iii, 5/6 (1930), pp. 1-23, 0. TAFRALI discusses the structure of this monastery, which was founded by the fifteenth century and subsequently came under the patronage of the house of the Movilt. George MovilA in 1578 as Hegumen rebuilt the church, and later his brother Jeremia decorated it with the frescoes and became the second founder. The church is of the well-known Moldavian type, trefoiled as the churches of Athos and Serbia. There is a dome of the Moldavian type, i.e., a second circle rests upon the square, which in turn is built upon the circle so common in Byzantine churches. The chief interest of the church is in the frescoes, which exist within and without the church and cover a large variety of subjects, scenes from the Old and New Testaments, cycles of St. Nicholas and St. George, and even scenes representing apparently Goliath, and various Greek thinkers and philosophers. There seems to be a strong occidental influence in the paintings, but the artists are also thoroughly imbued with Orthodox traditions and the au- thor does not endeavor to trace their exact provenance. He also gives the sepulchral inscriptions in the Church.</page><page sequence="21">190 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXV, 1931 TURKEY A Byzantine Manuscript.-In Art Bulletin, xii (1930), pp. 207-218 (8 figs.), M. V. ALPATOFF publishes miniatures from a Byzantine manuscript of the twelfth century. In keeping with the tendency to assign the best Byzantine miniatures to the Macedonian dynasty and the epoch of the Comnens, the illustrations of the Moscow manuscript have been hitherto attributed to the same period as the text. Investigation proves, however, that they belong to the meagrely represented Palaeologue epoch, in the fourteenth century. The miniatures here illustrated are remarkable for the expressiveness attained through the arrangements of the compositions. SWEDEN First Ship-grave at Valsgiirde.-In Fornvdnnen, iv (1930), pp. 217-236 (18 figs.), ALLAN FRIDELL discusses a barrow situated in the parish of Old Uppsala on the eastern bank of the river Fyris. The ship (boat) had been placed at a depth of one to two metres. The excavations were conducted by the University Museum for Nordic Antiquities during 1928. The bit of a horse is reported to have been discovered in the animal's cranium. Remains of a dog and articles of iron were also found. All these objects were outside the boat. In the western bow of the boat was a kettle and another bronze vessel. These had served to protect the bow sufficiently to enable us to tell that it was of fir wood. It has been possible to reconstruct the boat on the basis of the relative positions of certain objects re- maining. Apparently turned wooden bowls were included among the funeral furniture. Bone objects show painted lines. Near the centre of the craft lay a sword, a shield buckle (umbo), shield bolts, an iron weight covered with bronze, a bronze disk, and a glass pearl. The human bones that survived indicate that the man was placed on the north side of the mound with his feet turned towards the east and his sword by his side. Seemingly his burial was at a level higher than that of the boat. A second person, probably a bondsman, was interred outside near the stern of the craft. The barrow is assigned to the eleventh cen- tury, or perhaps to the latter half of the tenth. The Name Sweden.-In Fornvdnnen, iv (1930), pp. 193-216 (5 maps), ELIS WADMAN assumes that the oldest term Svearike (kingdom of the Svear) was limited to the regions bordering on the northern shores of Lake Malaren. He endeavors to show that the name svear (Osw. swiar, gen. swina) may be a formation related to Svinne- (Osw. Swina) in the compound Svinne-garnsviken, the name of a bay situated in the central part of the lake. This Osw. Swina- the author connects with Ndl. Swin, zwin "Watt," which means "shallow place on the coast laid bare at low tide." He traces the word swin to PG *sui-an, the -n of which originally belonged to the present stem only, which is shown by OIcel. stia. Swin-, in Svinnegarnsviken, refers thus to the drying up of, or to the elevation of the land in the region of the lake in question. But he also finds Swin- as the basis of names in other localities of the country. To the base swt, the name svear owes its origin. That the name in time was applied to the entire country is due to the central location and early importance of the region. Runic Inscription on the Horn of Gallehus.-In Fornvdnnen, iii (1930), pp. 165-174 (3 figs.), ELIAS WESSEN calls attention to the fact that with G. Krys- ing's drawing (1734) of the inscription on the Horn of Gallehus, Dr. G. Mar- strander has endeavored to read the last word of the inscription as alawido, which he translates "protected." This reading does not seem well founded. What Dr. Marstrander understands as the connective rune al, may very well be the result of the carving technique itself. The traditional reading tawido is undoubt-</page><page sequence="22">RENAISSANCE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1930 191 edly correct. The meaning of this word is probably that HlewagastiR not only made the horn but also decorated it with runes and pictures. The word holtijaR is interesting, since it permits us to trace back an actual Nordic dialectic difference into Primitive Nordic. The old Germanic languages (dialects) formed a closed circle: the eastern dialects in the North are closely connected with the East Germanic languages (Goth.), the western dialects in the North with the West Germanic languages, particularly with Old English. The boundary between forms with and those without a-mutation proceeds in this case straight through Denmark and Sweden. The name HlewagastiR belongs to the fairly numerous Prim. Nordic proper names, which had the general meaning "famous stranger." The second member seems, as a nominal element, to have been just as prevalent in the North as among East and West Germans. Later it was forced out in the North. The first ele- ment, Hlewa-, is a nominal element, a heritage of IE. times, to which the Germanic peoples still cling, although the word as an appellative has left no trace in their language. DENMARK Jellinge.-In Fornvdnnen, 1928, pp. 257-285 (figs.), SUNE LINDQUIST dis- cusses the antiquities at Jellinge. For the understanding of these the copper- plate engraving of 1591 is very helpful. Already the Danish historians Sven Aggeson and Saxo state in their chronicles (about 1185) that King Harold threw up the two equally large mounds as graves of his parents, Gorm and Tyra. If this information is correct, then it would be reasonable to designate the northern mound as that of Gorm, because it has a large chamber, whereas the southern Qne doubtlessly lacks such a chamber. As is seen from the contemporary form of burial in the city of Birka in Lake Miilaren, the rules were always observed, namely, that men, buried unburnt, were put into large chambers; the women, on the other hand, were put into a coffin of natural size. Sven and Saxo seem to have been correct insofar as King Harold erected the two mounds at Jellinge, one in memory of his father and the other of his mother, but they did not know that one of the mounds was a mere cenotaph. The author also calls attention to the current error that the runic stones usually occupied the top of the mound. Rather was it the practice in the Viking era to put the stones alongside of the Mound or by the roadside, where they could be better seen. Finally the author points out the significance which the erection of these magnificent memorials may have had for the perpetuation of the regard for the Gorm dynasty and its claims to the sovereignty in the land which was later united under Harold. RENAISSANCE ITALY Tuscan Sculptors in Venice in the Quattrocento.-In L'Arte, xxxiii (1930), pp. 427-465 (21 figs.), G. FOGOLARI finds important work in Venice by Piero di Nicolk from Florence and Martino da Fiesole, and he publishes also some little studied work by the Venetian Bartolomeo Bon. The Candelabra in S. Marco.-In Pantheon, 1930, pp. 471 ff., C. C. OMAN finds other pieces of goldsmith work that can be attributed to the anonymous master of the two silver candelabra in S. Marco which bear the arms of Doge Cristoforo Moro (1462-71). The works that show the same style as the candelabra are the reliquary of the head of S. Isidoro in S. Marco, the reliquary and chalice in the Cathedral of Capodistria, the chalice acquired in 1868 by the Victoria and Albert Museum.</page><page sequence="23">192 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXV, 1931 A New Picture by Piero della Francesca.-In Dedalo, 1930, pp. 133 ff., U. GNOLI publishes a small but very fine painting of the enthroned Madonna and Child with four angels, which he attributes to Piero della Francesca. This treasure is in a jealously guarded private collection. A Collaboration of Leonardo and Credi.-In Pantheon, 1930, pp. 368 ff., B. DEGENHART decides that the drawing with the Madonna and Child and St. Anne, St. John, and an angel, in the Biblioteca Marucelliana, which Berenson has attributed to Lorenzo di Credi, was partly drawn by Leonardo himself. The drawing is to be dated about 1478. The Villa Garzoni.-In L'Arte, xxxiii (1930), pp. 532-540 (5 figs.), V. MOSCHINI publishes some good views of one of the most representative works of Jacopo Sansovino, the Villa Garzoni at Pontecasale, and describes its outstanding features. The villa, because of its isolated and somewhat inaccessible location, has been little visited and does not have the renown that it deserves. It is now about to be abandoned to unworthy use and will certainly fall into ruin. The Bronzes of Leonardo da Vinci.-In Art Bulletin, xii (1930), pp. 254-269 (28 figs.), R. S. STITES makes another contribution to his study of Leonardo as sculptor. The Foulc group of Lion and Horseman, now the property of the Pennsylvania Museum, is the principal attribution here made to Leonardo. It is particularly among Leonardo's drawings that evidence is found for the attribution to him of the beautiful Car of Neptune in the Kunsthistorisches Museum at Vienna. Other works brought into relationship with the master are the Hercules and Antaeus in the Rhode Island School of Design, the so-called David in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum, and the Bronze Knocker in the Hermitage, hitherto attributed to Riccio. Leonardo as Verrocchio's Co-worker.-In Art Bulletin, xii (1930), pp. 43-89 (41 figs.), W. R. VALENTINER traces the hand of Leonardo in various paintings and sculptures which he believes were made in Verrocchio's atelier during Leonardo's prolonged association with Verrocchio. Examples include the Madonna and Child in the Alte Pinakothek at Munich, the Annunciation in the Louvre, the Madonna and Saints, partly by Filippino Lippi in the Uffizi, and especially the terra cotta relief of the Resurrection in the Villa Careggi at Florence. Arguments are also offered in support of the hypothesis that Leonardo had a part in the crea- tion of the Colleoni monument. An Attribution to Lotto.-In Belvedere, 1930, pp. 10 ff., K. N. OETTINGER gives a new attribution to the Concert in the National Gallery, which has been considered a work of Palma Vecchio's school. Comparison with certain authentic works of Lotto suggests that it may be attributed to that master and dated about 1523-24. Orazio Gentileschi.-In L'Arte, xxxiii (1930), pp. 541-551 (3 figs.), T. MEZ- ZETTI publishes some paintings done by Orazio Gentileschi in Ancona and Fabri- ano, determining by documentary evidence his period of activity here and show- ing that the work in the Marches gives the key to the artist's style as we see it exhibited elsewhere. GERMANY The Master of the "Beautiful Madonna."-In Zeit. Bild. K. lxiv (1930), pp. 167-174 (10 figs.), G. ANDRA traces the development of the master of the " Beauti- ful Madonna,"alife-size wooden statue in the Church of St. Sebald at Nuremberg, by grouping with it several other sculptures. Two works that can be assigned to the same period as the Madonna in this master's career are the John the Baptist in the same church at Nuremberg and the tomb of Bishop Albert von Wertheim in Bamberg Cathedral. Since the Madonna is evidently a little earlier than these</page><page sequence="24">RENAISSANCE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1930 193 two statues, and the Bamberg tomb dates about 1422, the Madonna must date about 1420, instead of near 1430 as has been hitherto supposed. Representative of this master's early career, about 1400, may be considered the statues of St. Bartholomew and two younger disciples in the Germanic Museum at Nuremberg, and representative of his late period, about 1440, is the splendid, dignified statue of St. Christopher from the Church of St. Sebald and now in the Germanic Museum in Nuremberg. Two Woodcuts of the Nuremberg School.-In Metr. Mus. Studies, ii, 2, pp. 171-175 (4 figs.), WILLIAM M. IVINS, Jr., discusses, in relation to Dtirer and Hans Sebald Beham, a woodcut showing the vine pattern with satyrs, and concludes that another woodcut, a small Crucifixion owned by the Museum is undoubtedly by Beham. The Augsburg Altarpiece.-In Miinch. Jb. vii (1930), pp. 111-124 (2 figs.), A. SCHRODER traces the history of the Augsburg Cathedral altarpiece. A silver shrine with scenes from the Passion was made by the goldsmith Peter Rimpfing in the last quarter of the fifteenth century. For this Holbein the Elder painted a cover in the early years of the sixteenth century. This painted altar picture did not long survive; a little after the middle of the century it was necessary to replace it. The painter of the new altar picture, which may still be seen in the cathedral in good condition, was Christoph Amberger, who here produced his best work. It seems more likely that instead of working from the remains of Holbein's picture or from the original drawing for it, which is now in the city museum at Danzig, Amberger merely trusted to his memory for the general arrangement of the compo- sition; for his work is very different from the Holbein drawing in detail, as it is, of course, in style, taking us into the full Renaissance, whereas Holbein's work is still Gothic. The Landscape Drawings of Wolfgang Huber.-In Miinch. Jb. vii (1930), pp. 1-104 (35 figs.), P. HALM makes an extensive study of the landscape drawings of Wolfgang Huber and adds a catalogue of the drawings, which includes 135 num- bers. Through thirty years of a career, that apparently began about 1510, Huber shows a development of qualities that are already evident in his earliest drawings. The reason for this consistency is that his whole activity as landscapist was based on an intimate acquaintance with nature. In this he was like Diirer, though the latter's approach was more intellectual, scientific, while Huber's was more naive. Eighteenth-Century South-German Woodwork.-In Metr. Mus. Studies, ii, 2, pp. 152-170 (16 figs.), ADOLF FEULNER and PRESTON REMINGTON discuss two pairs of doors of Munich provenance, with carved and gilded ornament on a white ground, which they attribute, stylistically, to Cuvillies, and date about 1740. The authors consider also a delicately carved and decorated commode, also of Munich origin, designed probably by Cuvilli&amp;s and executed by Joachim Dietrich, who died in 1753. HUNGARY Architect of the Royal Palace of Maria Theresa in Ofen.-In Archaeologiai Ertesiti, xlii (1928), pp. 166-187, JXNOs KAPOSSY, in the lack of material from the archives, tries to determine the authorship of the palace of Maria Theresa in Ofen. This is ascribed first to Johann Bernhard Fischer and a later reworking to Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt. The part of Fischer is doubtful, that of Hildebrandt practically impossible. The plans of the palace coincide with those of the French court architect Jadot de Ville Issey. In other respects the work is rather different, especially in execution, and the architect was probably Franz Anton Hillebrandt, who had worked with him and went to Budapest and Hungary, where he built the cathedral in Nagyvarad.</page><page sequence="25">194 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXV, 1931 BELGIUM Sixteenth-Century Double Virginal.-The Metropolitan Museum has recently received a double virginal dated 1581 and signed by Hans Ruckers. The instru- ment came from Peru, and it is said to have been made for Philip II of Spain to be presented to the Marquise of Oropesa, who was known as the Daughter of the In- cas. The outside of the virginal is undecorated except for a coat of dark paint, but the inside is elaborately ornamented with garden scenes, gilded gesso medallions, and fruit, flower, and bird designs (JAMES J. RORIMER, Metr. Mus. Studies, ii, 2, pp. 176-186 (14 figs.)). RUMANIA Ceramics in Relation to Other Phases of Art.-In Arta gi Arheologia, ii, 4 (1930), pp. 25-26, V. MIRONESCU discusses the advantages coming from the utili- zation of Rumanian folk motifs in their contemporary art. The Painter Octav Bincili.-In Arta gi Arheologia, ii, 4 (1930), pp. 11-24 (24 figs.), C. SATEANU discusses the works of the contemporary artist Octav BAncilt, who, living in Iayi, ranks very high among Rumanian artists. SPAIN El Greco-A Spaniard.-In Art Bulletin, xii (1930), pp. 13-18 (4 figs.), J. PIJOAN opposes the view of August L. Mayer that the style of El Greco is essentially Orien- tal. His peculiarities are here analyzed as thoroughly harmonious with the Span- ish nature, and it is contended that he came to Spain with his style unformed, trained only in technique. FAR EASTERN INDIA Fresh Light on the Stone Ages in Southeastern India.-In Antiquity, iv, 15 (1930), 327-339, L. A. CAMMIADE and M. C. BURKITT, from examination of a series of industries, correlate a close connection between India and South Africa from early Palaeolithic to Mesolithic times. CHINA Primitive Man.-In Antiquity, v, 17 (1931), pp. 21-36 (8 figs.), G. ELLIOT SMITH gives a rsume, The Discovery of Primitive Man in China. JAPAN Japanese Armor.-In Metr. Mus. Studies, ii, 2, pp. 221-235 (28 figs.), THOMAS T. HOOPES discusses the recent acquisitions of the museum in the field of Japanese arms and armor. Among the collection are helmets, one of which dates as early as the fourth century A.D., bodyguards, stirrups, bits, and a complete suit of the fourteenth century.

NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS These last few weeks before the new excavation season began have been utilized by the foreign archaeological schools as a convenient time for holding their open meetings to report on the work which they have accomplished in their last year's campaigns. On March 1 the Greek Archaeological Society held its annual meeting</page><page sequence="26">ATHENS] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1930 195 when Mr. Oikonomos, the secretary, read his report on the results of the various excavations financed by the society last year. Summaries of these reports will be given below and in the next series of news items. On the 23 of March Mr. Heurt- ley, the Assistant Director of the British School, spoke in Greek to the Archaeo- logical Society on his work in Ithaka last summer.' The American School held two open meetings, the first on February 10, when Mr. Broneer spoke on "Eros and Aphrodite on the North Slope of the Acropolis," his subject arising from his discovery of an inscription cut in the rock of the north slope, referring to Aphrodite and her son Eros, and giving the date of their festival as the fourth day of the month Munychia. TOI EPOTI HE EOPTH TETPAAI HI*TAMENO MONIXIONO* MENO* By the forms of the letters the inscription must be dated in the fifth century. An exploration carried out by Mr. Broneer revealed some traces of the sanctuary itself, and the small finds prove that the shrine was in use down to Christian times. It is probable that the passage in Pausanias (1.27) concerning the mysterious rite of the priestesses or Arrephores refers to this Sanctuary of Aphrodite as it lies very near the foot of the small stairway leading down from the Acropolis. At this same meeting Mr. Carpenter spoke on "An Original and Several Copies from the Parthenon West Pediment." Mr. Carpenter had discovered in the shed in front of the Acropolis Museum part of a draped female figure which he has identified as belonging to the west pediment of the Parthenon. The figure was that of a woman draped in a himation and seated on a rock. The statue had been broken at the waist, but its original pose can be determined as Carrey, in 1674, drew it, and it was known by the letter U in the series of pediment figures. The fragment recognized by Mr. Carpenter can be identified as belonging to the Parthenon west gable by its size, style and technique and by its correspondence with the marks on the floor of the pediment and, furthermore, by its resemblance to one of the seven statuettes found at Eleusis which were copies, on a smaller scale, of the west gable figures of the Parthenon. At a second meeting, held on March 18, Mr. Kourou- niotis, the Director of the Department of Antiquities, and Mr. George Mylonas told of their excavations at Eleusis during the summer of 1930, excavations which the American School had very generously and unexpectedly financed for them.2 On February 26 Mr. H. G. Payne, Director of the British School of Archaeology, reported on the excavations of their school last spring at the site of the temple of Hera Akraia on the promontory of Perachora, opposite Corinth.3 Sir Arthur Evans spoke on March 26 at the British School on "Recent Discoveries at Knos- sos." 4 At the French School, on March 17, M. P. Demargne read a paper on the "Cemeteries of Mallia," which embodies the results of their latest campaign in the region of the cemeteries at Mallia in Crete. In the summer of 1930 they cleared and studied the building at "Kato-Chrysolakko," which had been known for many years, but only partially explored by M. Renaudin in 1921. M. Demargne con- siders this building to have been a necropolis consisting of various rooms, as at Mochlos, and united within one circuit wall. The place had been plundered, but some rather fine examples of gold jewellery had been overlooked by the robbers and were recovered by the excavators. On March 31 M. Roussel, the Director of the 1 Reported in News Items, A.J.A. XXXV, No. 1. 2 Reported in more detail below. 3 Reported in News Items, A.J.A.

On March 20 Theodore Makridy, formerly Assistant Director of the Museum in Constan- tinople and recently appointed Director of the Benachi Museum in Athens, read a paper at the German Archaeological Institut on the Church of Panachrantos, the burial place of the Palaeologoi, in Constantinople. The opening of the Benachi Museum, which contains fine collections of em- broideries and other minor arts, is to take place this spring. The archaeological museum at Nauplia is to be removed to larger quarters in the Venetian Palace, and the pottery and other objects from Asine are to be installed there. These had been taken to Sweden for further study and cleaning, but have now been returned. The Nauplia Museum will now rank as one of the most important outside Athens and, indeed, the most important for the study of the prehistoric civilizations of Greece. A recent addition to the National Museum at Athens is a colossal marble archaic "Apollo," found on the Island of Keos. This was a chance find and, as one may gather from literary sources that this island had been fairly densely populated in ancient times, it should provide a fertile field for scientific exploration by archaeologists. At present the best known monument on the island is the colossal lion cut in the rock near the modern town of Tzia. The 1931 excavation season has already begun with Mr. Shear working on the cemeteries at Corinth, Mr. David Robinson carrying on a second campaign at Olynthos and Mr. Heurtley exploring a prehistoric mound near Florina, while Miss Winifred Lamb is excavating again at Thermi in Lesbos 1 and Mr. Austin is continuing the work which he began at Haliartos in 1925. The Italian School at Athens has carried out several campaigns on the Island of Lemnos since their first explorations there in 1926. The results of their more recent work are now available. On the site of the ancient city of Hephaesteia buildings of different periods were found, but perhaps the most interesting was a village belonging to the Geometric Period, situated on a low hill with several groups of houses built on either side of a long paved road. The pottery found in this settlement corresponds exactly to that found with the burials of the Geometric necropolis,2 and both are obviously of the same date. The plan of the houses recalls the megaron type of the second city at Troy-a vestibule and a long room- and affords another proof of the persistence of Mycenaean influence in architecture down to the sixth century. Some of the decorated potsherds found in the settle- ment show the influence of late Mycenaean designs, while other sherds have either Geometric designs in relief or human figures, such as a man mounted on a horse with very long, stiff legs similar to the type used in archaic Cretan sculpture, or two divinities riding in a chariot. The most striking discovery, however, consists of some sherds with inscriptions in a non-Greek language, with letters ,which seem to resemble the Lemnio-Phrygian alphabet. The Italian excavators believe that these sherds prove that the famous stele from Kaminia was not imported from Phrygia, but was a local product of Lemnos before the Greek conquest. The Italian expedition also excavated an important sanctuary which appears to have been divided into three large chambers. In the central one, apparently the actual shrine, the paved floor is still well preserved and many votive offerings were found, such as bronze fishhooks, harpoon heads, a lamp in Parian marble and various vases fixed to the floor for libation or sacrificial purposes. The chamber to the south has, in the centre, a small octagonal pointed column. This room contained a rich deposit of figurines in terra-cotta and sherds of local pottery together with a few fragments of Ionic and black-figured Attic vases. The vases may originally 1 Reported in News Items, A.J.A. XXXIII, No. 3. 2 Ibid., 1.</page><page sequence="28">ATHENS] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1930 197 have been filled with small seeds or grain, as the carbonized remains of these have been found in great quantities among the sherds. Particularly interesting are the terra-cotta figurines and a number of clay models of buildings which appear to represent sacred fountains. No objects later than the end of the sixth century were discovered in the Geometric settlement, when apparently both the sanctuary and the town of Hephaesteia were destroyed by the Persians.1 At Eleusis three different regions were selected for investigation in 1930. One of these, outside the Sanctuary on the southern slope of the Eleusinian acropolis, had been excavated by Professor Skias in the years 1895-1902, before much was known about the prehistoric civilizations of Greece. In 1930 Mr. George Mylonas cleared this region down to the rock, where he found the foundations of Middle Helladic houses resting on the rock itself. These houses were of two styles, some with rectangular outline and others with apsidal ends. Under the floors of these houses and between the walls were found burials of small children. One complete grave was cut out and transferred intact to the Museum. The sherds and vases from this settlement are especially valuable, providing fine examples of Minyan ware. Remains of Late Helladic I houses were found built on top of those be- longing to the Middle Helladic period and at a still higher level there were heavy Geometric walls. Mr. Kourouniotis, aided by Mr. Mylonas, cleared the area outside the Sanctuary and to the northeast of the west Triumphal Arch. The remains of a road were brought to light which bordered the outer Roman Peribolos and led to the south. Under the level of the road were found water pipes, lead pipes for the clean water and a big sewer. This last is excellently built and vaulted over with tiles, and is so high that a man, by bending slightly, can walk in it. At frequent intervals it has manholes. On the side of the road opposite the Peribolos there were uncovered a series of buildings, probably rest-houses and shops. They are for the most part composed of small communicating rooms, whose walls were covered with wall-paintings. Some of the houses had wells with marble curbs, and in two instances latrines were found. One series of these shops at the eastern corner of the Peribolos were built directly over a Hellenistic bathing establishment, of which only a circular room is well preserved. On the floor of this room, arranged in a circle in front of a low wall or bench, were fifteen basins. The bathers could sit on the bench and bathe their feet in the basins. Mr. Kourouniotis also cleared a great square area in front of the Stoa of Philo, digging down to the native rock, which was found at an average depth of ten metres. In front of the Stoa was found part of the Peisistratean Peribolos built in the same style as the rest of this Peribolos, with the upper part of the wall made of sun-dried bricks. A portion of this has been roofed over to preserve it. After the Persians broke through this wall Kimon closed the breach with poros blocks, and in this year's excavation the end of Kimon's wall built into the sun-dried brick of the earlier wall was found in front of the Stoa. Under the foundation of the Peribolos wall were found remains of prehistoric houses and, deeper still, two cist-graves belonging to the closing years of the Middle Helladic period. In the later of these were found a bronze dagger, a jug and some pierced boars' tusks similar to those found in the fourth Shaft Grave at Mycenae. The uncovering of the remaining part of the Peisistratean Peribolos will be carried out in the next campaign. At Thebes Professor Keramopoullos examined the region to the south of the railway station where, during excavations for the erection of refugee houses, the ruins of a house of great archaeological interest were discovered. The house had been destroyed by fire. The jambs of the doorway were of poros, the threshold of marble and the walls of crude brick and stone, and were covered by several 1 For pictures of the pottery, etc., see Illustrated London News, Feb. 28, 1931.</page><page sequence="29">198 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXV, 1931 layers of plaster. The existing fragments of this plaster show incised lines and traces of colors. Near one corner of the room were found painted figurines of terra-cotta, perhaps fallen from a shelf where they stood as ornaments. There was also found a headless marble statuette of a woman, draped and preserving traces of color on the drapery. In another corner of the room stood a carelessly built semi-circular structure which probably formed the base of a loom, judging by the numerous clay loom-weights found near it. The presence in the ruins of a Boeotian coin of the period from 220 to 197 B.c. indicates that the burning of the house was not connected with the destruction of Thebes by Alexander in 336 B.c., but must be assigned to a much later date. Mr. Keramopoullos concludes that the house was probably destroyed in the time of Mummius in 146/5 B.c. At Florina, in Macedonia, Professor Keramopoullos conducted a trial excavation after the accidental discovery of a vase with stamped representation of the capture of Troy. The vase had been found complete, but the presence of Greek letters upon it caused it to be broken by its non-Greek finder. A portion of the vase was, how- ever, recovered and brought to the Museum. On the northern slope, above the bed of the stream which runs through Florina, there once lay an ancient city the name of which is still unknown. This city was built in terraces which were sup- ported by walls, a great part of which has been removed by the modern in- habitants for building purposes. The few remaining bits of masonry can, how- ever, be dated as belonging to the fourth century and later. Trial trenches were dug at many points in the region of the ancient city, yielding everywhere evidences of fire and violent destruction. Many kylixes and plates of grey clay bear a stamped central star-shaped ornament which connects them with similar vases of the classical Greek period. The vase first found belongs to the later Macedonian period, and to the same time belong the skyphoi with impressed ornament of the so-called Megarian style. Other vases were made of red clay, among which are many pithoi. In all probability this pottery is of local manufacture. Those vases made of grey clay were apparently not imported, either, for the loom weights were made of this same clay. Mr. Keramopoullos considers that the civi- lization of this city was undoubtedly Hellenic and, on the evidence of some scattered sherds with lustrous glaze, he would put the beginnings of the city in the fifth century. The destruction of the city apparently took place in Roman times. Some scattered squared blocks were found of an imported red stone from Banitsa, and belonged evidently to more pretentious buildings, most of the houses being built of crude brick on local stone foundations. Near the conjectural entrance to the acropolis the foundations of a structure, possibly a temple or an altar, were partly uncovered. Mr. Keramopoullos hopes that further excavations may be possible in this region. Another trial excavation was conducted by the same archaeologist at Eratyra, to the southwest of the village of Selitsa, where an isolated hillock or "magoula" is crowned by an ancient wall, only the foundations of which are preserved today. Under this hill Mr. Keramopoullos dug trial trenches and discovered the remains of an ancient settlement which had been destroyed by fire in the first century B c. At the time of its destruction the storerooms were full, since the charred remains of wheat, lentils, chickpease, vetch and raisins were found. The pottery, black or grey in color, bears stamped ornamentation. The plain in which this hillock lies is protected by five forts belonging to the Macedonian period. In all probability this region belonged to Elimeia, and the forts guarded the passes to Orestis (Orestias) and Eordaia. At Dion Professor George Sotiriades renewed in 1930 his work on the vaulted tomb which he had discovered in 1929. The imposing fagade and entrance were cleared. These were built in the style of a small Doric temple and the colors, red,</page><page sequence="30">ATHENS] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1930 199 blue and yellow, on the architectural members were still fresh. The tomb con- sisted of an antechamber and the vaulted burial chamber. These were built of blocks of conglomerate, and the inner walls and ceilings had been covered with stucco which had fallen in many places, but the original colored decoration was still visible elsewhere, and the designs have been copied. The marble couch on which the body of the deceased was laid had been broken and the bones scattered, as the tomb had been plundered by thieves, who entered through an opening in the vaulted roof. On the marble border of the couch had been painted a row of horse- men one of whom was a Scythian and one a Thracian. The colors have faded, but it was possible to distinguish the horses in a grey color with the riders' garments painted in rose and blue and their sandals in deep red. The representation of the horses is unusually fine; the heads of the riders, unfortunately, can scarcely be distinguished. In the d bris left by the plunderers were found two small lamps of very late Roman and early Christian times. The tomb itself must be dated many centuries earlier than the time of the plundering because of the beauty and elegance of its architecture and painted decoration, although no pottery has so far been found to give a clue to its exact date. Mr. Kyparissis, acting for the Archaeological Society, continued in 1930 his exploration of ancient cemeteries at Chalandritsa in Achaia and at Manessi near Kalavryta. At Hagios Basileios of Chalandritsa, the second unplundered rock-cut chamber tomb was cleared and plans drawn. In this tomb several skeletons were found in a part of the tomb which had been disturbed by the fall of masses of rock from the roof. Along with the bones were fragments of pottery which, on being joined together, formed a large amphora, several stirrup vases, some small pithoi and three-handled jars. These are of the usual late Mycenaean type with charac- teristic simple linear decoration consisting of curved lines and zigzags-the immediate forerunner of the Geometric degeneration of the Mycenaean style. At Troumbes of Chalandritsa, Mr. Kyparissis investigated the middle tholos tomb which had built partitions across it, and within these were remains of skeletons and funerary objects There were very few of the latter, only three pots, one terra-cotta animal and a bronze pin. All the pots bear pure Geometric ornament of post-Mycenaean date, and the shapes of the vases indicate the same period. A characteristic decoration was a reserve zone with a procession of cranes, while fine parallel lines covered the rest of the surface. In the region near Chalandritsa are many other small-pointed hillocks, upon which the excavator found other built tombs in one of which, two kilometres from Chalandritsa, is the large foundation of a wrecked tomb. Only one small blade of obsidian was found here. Beyond Chalandritsa, at a place called Agriapidia, other tombs were found encircled by slab-like stones. Within this enclosure the tombs are rectangular and built of similar stone slabs. They measure 2.70 m. in length and vary from 1.40 m. to 1.15 m. in width and contain bones, clay whorls and four undecorated and badly baked pots of coarse clay. Near the village of Manessi, at a place called Vromo- meri, a collapsed rock-cut tomb was examined. From it were recovered some Late Helladic pots and three askoid lamps with suspension handles. For further investigation Mr. Kyparissis noted two cemeteries, one near the village of Men- dzena and the other at the village of Gourzoumisa, where there is an acropolis attributed to ancient Leontion. At Stymphalos Mr. Orlandos carried out a short campaign in 1930. Since the agora of the city was covered by the lake, the work was restricted to the region beside the great rock-cutting to the east of the building discovered last year, and a semi-circular exedra, 3.10 m. in diameter, was uncovered. This exedra was of good workmanship and consisted of two steps and a bench, which backed against</page><page sequence="31">200 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XXXV, 1931 an admirably worked wall of ashlar masonry. At the northeast corner of the city wall a new gate was found, similar to the one found in 1926 but without the interior circular court.' In the plain to the north of the acropolis, and at a distance of about forty meters from it, some rectangular rooms of a Roman house were cleared. The house was built around a court, and had one peculiarity in that in several of the rooms there were square sections of the floor near the walls paved with baked bricks. As these paved areas are small, 1.20 m. square, Mr. Orlandos thinks they must have been hearths. The basis mentioned in Praktika (1926, p. 134) was further cleared and the inscription upon it was read more correctly, giving the name Aleximachos instead of Lysimachos.2 In Crete Mr. Marinatos continued his interesting exploration of the cave of Eileithyia. The campaign of 1930, with the assistance of artificial light, pro- ceeded to the complete clearance of this important cave. The small objects found were, with the exception of some insignificant bronze strips, exclusively fragments of pottery of all periods. The Neolithic sherds were especially numerous. In this respect the cave of Eileithyia at Amnisos resembles the Kamares Cave, but differs from the other cult caves, and especially from that at Arkalochori, where metal objects are numerous. These were chiefly weapons which testified to the nature of the divinity worshipped there. The cave of Eileithyia runs approxi- mately from east to west, and its eastern entrance opens on a small ravine. From the entrance to about the middle of the cave the floor is slightly inclined. Beyond, it rises a little and ends with an extremely low recess, which is full of stalactites and stalagmites. The greatest length of the cave is about sixty meters, and its width varies from nine to thirteen meters except for some fissure-like offshoots, where the width reaches nineteen meters. The greatest height of the cave is about four meters. Immediately within the entrance of the cave on the left are the remains of a rectangular structure, perhaps a simple peribolos. About the middle of the cave are two built compartments, connected and enclosing one or two stalactites, as though within an adyton. A little before the end of the cave and under the root of a stalagmite is a small hole which leads to four hollows beneath the floor. These also contained fragments of pottery. From a pre- liminary study of these potsherds Mr. Marinatos concluded that the cave was often subjected to cleaning and levelling, for, alongwith the Neolithic sherds which were found in abundance in the lowest layers, there were mixed also later sherds especially Roman and even one Byzantine or Venetian example. It therefore seems probable that in Roman times when the cult was extended within the cave, if one may judge by the evidence of the abundant Roman lamps and other pot- sherds, the cave was periodically house-cleaned. At these times there must have been thrown out the vast numbers of sherds found in the ravine outside the cave. On account of this disturbance it will be very difficult to reconstruct many vases from the sherds. Beyond the cave toward the north is an open area certainly con- nected with the cult of the cave in some way, perhaps providing also a place for the priests to live. The buildings which stood here have disappeared for the greater part, and only the outlines of a few rooms could be distinguished. Within one of these rooms was found the base of a small column. The chief small objects found here include a diminutive figure of an ox, in lead, some clay beads and a bone pin. From these finds the excavator concludes that these structures date from the L. M. III and the Geometric Periods. Opposite the cave of Eileithyia Mr. Marinatos discovered another cave, smaller and not a cult cave, but one which served as a tomb from early to late Minoan times, similar to the well-known cave 1 Praktika, 1926, p. 152. 2 S6ayOS 2TrU/ aXiwOV.

M. pots were found and some ornaments of silver. The occurrence of silver ornaments is characteristic also of the cave at Pyrgos and of the E. M. tholos tomb excavated by Mr. Marinatos near the village of Krasi in Pedias. It also connects the Early Minoan civilization of the north shore of Crete with the civilization of the Cyclades, where silver ornaments are numerous. On the other hand, in the plain of Mesara at this period gold ornaments predominate. E. P. B.</page></plain_text>
