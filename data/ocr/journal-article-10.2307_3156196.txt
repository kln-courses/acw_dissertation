Ac- cording to Mr. Duff, among the doctrines which the student for the Christian ministry should study in their Hebrew original are these: I. Divine Sovereignty, II. God's Love, iII. The Hereafter. The discussion is vigorous, very interesting and suggestive. The argument for the thorough study of the Hebrew Scriptures is especially strong. The address could be studied with profit by beginners in the history of Christian doctrines. OUTLINES OF PRIJa l'I V*, B T.T r.7P* One of the good signs of the times is the deep interest manifested in the re- lations of the world's various religions to Christianity. In no other way can its immense superiority be so fully demonstrated as by those full and fair compari- sons, the best materials for which are so amply furnished by such diligent students as Mr. Keary. His connection with the British Museum gave him access to in- formation within the reach of but few, and he has made the most of his advantages. His present work displays thorough knowledge of his theme, great skill in the management of his discussion, and admirable literary ability. He has made a most arid subject wonderfully attractive. His book is full of matured thought and valuable learning, and his investigations are arranged in the most convenient and interesting manner for the reader. He has not attempted to explain the origin of belief, but to describe its character among the Indo-European races. He gives the result of his studies of the Vedas, Homer, Hesiod, the Eddas and Sagas, and Mediaeval legends and epics. His book will prove helpful, if studied with that true mental independence which characterizes the best students. His conclusions are so largely biased by his philosophy, which we believe to be very faulty, that they must be subjected to the severest historical and logical tests before accept- ance. Thus, in his discussion of the " Nature of Belief," which occupies the first fifty pages, Mr. Keary does not undertake to say what kind of a being the first man was, though he strongly hints that he was hardly above the brute; but he is not in doubt in regard to the mental and moral natures of the primitive Aryan. These existed only in embryo, and religion was therefore devoid of all ideas of right and wrong, and bore no relation to morality. Belief was-for that matter, still is-- simply " the capacity to worship" ; and religion, as we find it, has passed through three distinct stages. "The first is the fetich-worshiping stage, when man's thoughts are concentrated purely upon visible concrete substances. The second we call the nature-worshiping stage. In it the objects of belief are still external and sensible, but they are also, in a certain degree, generalized, and are not often tangible. The third is the anthropomorphic or ethical stage, when the divinity is conceived as a being like mankind, and the ethical qualities of that being have to be taken fully into account. The reasoning by which this position is maintained is very inconclusive. For example, it does not follow that because all earliest lan- guages are rude and express their ideas in physical terms, that those ideas origi- nated through contact with the physical world. Equally illogical is the statement that " looking upward aroused some moral thoughts " which led men to endow " the high thing," a tree or mountain, with " moral qualities." Just as unsound are his other arguments for the progressive development of religion, for the evi- dence which he adduces shows that wherever we find a primitive faith, we find the notion of personality, "the voice of God in man seeking for a Personal object of worship." He, however, assumes a primitive Fetichism which has no thought be- yond the material object. *Outlines of Primitive Belief among the Indo-European Races. By Charles Francis Keary, M. A., F. S.
