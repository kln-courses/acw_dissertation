Walsh Abstract Beginning with Elizabethan literary references to a carnivalesque celebration of Martinmas, the present article surveys the St Martin cult in England in order to isolate features of the medieval celebration of the Christian feast and determine the feast's relationship to seasonal activities of early November. Martinmas is seen as both the last harvest festival and a curtain raiser for the extended winter revelling season, in effect a "Carnival" in late autumn. The great medieval feast days of the saints were steadily whittled away in England in the course of the Reformation so that little was left of them by the end of Cromwell's Protectorate. One which scarcely survived into modem times was evidently important enough in the Middle Ages to have earned the suffix -mas, along with Michaelmas, Hallowmas, Christmas and Candlemas. This was Martlemas or Martinmas (Middle English, Martinmesse), the principal feast of that early Western saint, Martin of Tours, celebrated throughout Europe on 11 November. [1] By sheer historical coincidence the date continues to be honoured in presentday England as Armistice Day, but the pacifist soldier-saint and monk-bishop is not the object of contemplation in the ritual minute of silence still widely observed thereon. Literary Remnants of Martinmas In the fertile literary period between the establishment of the Church of England and the Puritan Revolution we do, however, notice a variety of "surface finds," to use an archaeological metaphor, which strongly suggest that a developed celebration of Martinmas did exist previously in England. This festival had a pronounced secular character and was, indeed, a kind of "shadow" Carnival ushering in, instead of ushering out, the winter revelling season. It was simul- taneously the final harvest festival, as an early record from Hedington indi- cates-inter festum S. Michaelis et S. Martini venient cum toto ac pleno dyteno (between the feasts of St Michael and St Martin they sing harvest home. Kennett 1816, 65). Martinmas also designated a micro-season of the agricultural year, roughly the middle two weeks of November, chiefly characterised by the slaughter of beasts for winter provision and the testing of the new wine (see Figure 1). This essay will explore both the feast and the season of Martinmas as interdependent phenomena, both under the aegis of the great bishop of Tours.

The Bodleian Library, University of Oxford (Rawl. D393 part 2. Detail of November). By kind permission. We can find conspicuous shards of this older English Martinmas in the works of no less an author than Shakespeare. Sir John Falstaff, that carnivalesque persona par excellence, is pointedly referred to as "the martlemas" in Act 2 scene 2 of Henry IV, Part 2-"the martlemas" is one of the choice cattle culled for slaughter at the winter threshold of 11 November. The ascetic saint of Tours, paradoxically, lends his name to the slaughtered animal and, by extension, to the indulgent feast upon its flesh. This association developed fairly early on. In an English illuminated almanac c. 1370, for example, Bishop Martin holds an axe identical to the one a butcher employs to stun an ox as a typical "labour" for the month of November (see Figure 2). The O.E.D. cites two fourteenth-century uses of the term mart from the Durham Account Rolls (1307) and the Priory of Finchale (1368), as well as a reference from the romance Sir Tristram (c. 1320). Elizabethan dictionaries confirm the identification.

By kind permission. tus (fattened ox) in Peter Levins's Manipulus Vocabulorum (1570); and Baret's Alvearie (1580) offers the variants, "a marte or marterne" (Levins 1867, 307). One of the godfathers of Gluttony in Marlowe's Doctor Faustus likewise is "Martin Martlemas-beefe" (Act 2 scene 1). The Martlemas image adds to a cluster of references to Falstaff in 1 Henry IV as well-marbled, prime beef ("huge hill of flesh," "roasted Maningtree ox with a pudding in his belly," Act 2 scene 4; "sweet beef," Act 3 scene 3), or as the detritus of slaughter ("greasy tallow-catch," "stuffed cloakbag of guts," Act 2 scene 4). "That damned brawn," "the old boar," "the town bull," the "fat deer" to be "emboweled" and, in another context, the great stag of Windsor Forest are further incarnations. Falstaff is also personified as the mellow post-harvest season, the "latter spring" and "Allhallown Summer" (Act 1 scene 1). Spencer, in the "mutability cantos" of The Fairie Qveene, in his allegorical figure of November created a similar, meaty King Carnival: Next was Nouember, he full grosse and fat, As fed with lard, and that right well might seeme; For, he had been a fatting hogs of late, That yet his browes with sweat did reek and steem, And yet the season was full sharp and breem (Wilson 1961, 30. Book VII, canto vii). The slaughter of swine was likewise highlighted in a mid-fifteenth century calendar poem from MS. Digby 88 in the Bodleian:</page><page sequence="4">234 Martin W. Walsh November At Martynesmasse I kylle my swyne; December And at Cristesmasse I drynke redde wyne (Robbins 1955, 62 and 246). In the East Riding of Yorkshire presents of sausages, black puddings and so on, at Martinmas were, in the last century, known as "pig cheer" (Gutch 1912, 112). The feast was more often associated with beef in the English tradition, however. For instance, in Sir Thomas Salusbury's A Masque at Knowsley House (1640) another November personification boasts particularly of his beef tallow: The dayes are shortest now, the tedious night blinds all the earth, whilst I for your delight light out of darknes bringe, and offer more than all the pleasant Months haue done before. The stall fedd Ox, that on his back doth beare spoyles of the fruitfull Seasons of the yeare I sacrificze, and that from's entrayls take shall restore day, and keepe the world awake! (George 1991, 265). To have "Martlemas beef" was also proverbial for a well-stocked larder. It is what would get one through the winter as a meat-eater. Thomas Tusser in his A Hundreth Good Pointes of Husbandrie (1557) advises, for the month of Novem- ber: For Easter, at Martilmas, hange up a biefe: for pease fed and stall fed, play pickpurse the thiefe. What that and fat bakon, till grasse biefe come in: thy folke shall loke cherely, when others loke thin (Tusser 1970, 31). and elsewhere: And Martilmas beef doth bear good tack, When country folk do dainties lack. and again: Make Martilmas beef, Dear meat is a thief (Tusser 1812, xxxvi and 43). The yeoman hero, George a Greene, in the play The Pinner of Wakefield (c. 1590) twice employs the formula, "You shall have wafer cakes your fill, a peece of beefe hung vp since Martilmas" in reconciling his defeated opponents, among them Robin Hood (Greene 1905, 2:198 and 211). Somewhat earlier, in Wynkyn de Worde's Lytell geste how the plowman lerned his pater noster, we find a prosperous farmer who: "To make good ale, malte he had plentye: And Martylmas befe to hym was not deyntye." Conversely, "Martlemas beef" could refer, not to the plenty of Martinmas slaughter, but to the last, unappetising smoked meat at the tail end of winter. One of the earliest literary references is of this type. In the dialogue Wynnere and Wastoure (c. 1352-70), Wynnere underscores his meagre fare with the lines: "For alle es Martynmesse mete at I with moste dele/Noghte bot worttes with the flesche" (Trigg 1990, 12 lines 345-6). More commonly, however, "Martlemas beef" has celebratory connotations as we find in Shake- speare and the other Elizabethans.</page><page sequence="5">Medieval English Martinmesse 235 Sir John Falstaff also appropriates that other ingredient of Martinmas feasting as practised on the continent even today, the November new-wine or must: "There's a whole merchant's venture of Burdeaux stuff in him," says Doll Tearsheet in 2 Henry IV (Act 2 scene 4). The "Burdeaux stuff" is the recent vintage from that former English province of Aquitaine which arrived at Vintry wharf for distribution to the taverns of London annually on or about St Martin's Day. (More of the Vintners and their Company later.) Falstaff frequently is the wine barrel ("a tun of man," "that huge bombard of sack," 1 Henry IV, Act 2 scene 4), the anthropomorphic wine barrel being a typical carnival topos. Thomas Nashe in Pierce Penilesse His Svpplication to the Diuell (1592), outlining the "Eight Kinds of Drunkeness," follows "maudlin drunk" with what I take to be another adjective derived from a saint [2]: "The sixth [kind] is martin drunk, when a man is drunk and drinks himself sober ere he stir," that is, Martinmas indulgence as the epitome of social drinking (Nashe 1592, 80). In German and Dutch, similarly, the term Martinsman referred to a jovial festival drunkard. An early Scots weather proverb seems to refer as much to the drunkard's paradise as to earth's fertility: "Between Martinmas and Yule, water's wine in every pool" (Marvin 1916, 147). Another satirical reference to excessive Martinmas drinking can be found in the list of bogus relics in Tarltons Newes Out of Purgatorie (1590) where "for the Squinsey," or throat inflammation, "Saint Martins trough" (the wine vat) is recommended (Creigh and Belfield 1987, 168 and 199). The other great Elizabethan clown, Will Kemp, also invoked the name of the saint in praising his Host of Rockland in Kemps Nine Daies Wonder: Performed in a Daunce from London to Norwich (1600): By this some guest cryes, "Ho, the house!" A fresh friend hath a fresh carouse Still he will drinke, and still be dry, And quaffe with euery company. Saint Martin send him merry mates. To enter at his hostree gates! For a blither lad than he Cannot an Inkeeper be (Kemp 1840, 14). A nonsense song in Thomas Ravenscroft's Deuteromelia, or the Second Part of Musicks Melodie (1609) seems to belong to this same tradition as well: Martin said to his man, Fie! man, fie! Oh, Martin said to his man, Who's the fool now? Martin said to his man, Fill thou the cup, and I the can; Thou hast well drunken, man: Who's the fool now? (Haughton 1988, 87). It is clear that St Martin quite comfortably belongs in the raucous world of the Elizabethan tavern. The very geography of London added to these Martinian wine associations. Not only was there a St Martin-in-the-Vintry, but when the church of St Martin-le-Grand was razed after that monastery's dissolution in</page><page sequence="6">236 Martin W. Walsh 1548 its east end was converted into an enormous wine tavern (London Illustrata 1:117). Indirect evidence for a long English tradition of Martinmas inebriation can also be found in anti-Catholic satire. In a 1580 Puritan tract, Beehive of the Romish Churche, we find a diatribe against patron saints: St Hugh and St Eustace gotten the hunters in garde, St Martin and St Urban the aleknights, tavern-hunters, and drunkardes, St Arnolde is Baal over the Millers, St Steeuen ouer the Weauers (Walcott 1879, 43. Book IV, fol. 259b). Barnabe Googe's 1570 translation of Thomas Naogeorgus's The Popish Kingdome or reigne of Antichrist (1555) expands on the Martinmas theme: To belly cheare yet once againe doth Martin more encline, Whom all the people worshippeth, with rosted Geese and wine: Both all the day long and the night, now ech man open makes His vessels all, and of the Must oft times the last he takes Which holy Martyn afterwards, alloweth to be wine, Therefore they him unto the skies extoll, with prayse deuine: And drinking deepe in tankardes large, and bowles of compasse wide (Googe 1880, 55). To be sure, this is describing folk custom in Naogeorgus's native Rhineland, not Britain, but there would not be much point in translating such a passage if there were no resonances whatsoever for an English-speaking audience. William Warner in The Second Part of Albion's England (1589) chronicles earlier rural celebration of the feast in the words of a "simple Northerne-man" giving some idea of these Martinmas drinking parties: At Martelmasse wa turnd a crabbe, thilke told of Roben hood, Till after long time myrke, whe blest were windowes, dares &amp; lights, And pails were fild, &amp; hathes were swept, gainst Fairie-elues &amp; sprits (Warner 1589, Book V, chap. 24). Martinmas, as the winter threshold feast, recalls, in storytelling by the fire, the greenwood of Springtide, just as the late autumn phenomenon of Indian Summer acquires the saint's name-"Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyons' days," says Joan de Pucelle in 1 Henry VI (Act 1 scene 2). In the masque within that very autumnal play The Tempest we find an even more striking statement of this theme of seasonal transposition: "Spring come to you at the farthest/In the very end of harvest!" (Act 4 scene 2). Somewhat beyond Shakespeare's lifetime, but considered "ancient" in 1769, is the Scots and Border ballad "Get Up and Bar the Door": It fell about the Martinmas time And a gay time it was then, When our goodwife got puddings to make, And she's boiled them in the pan (Bronson 1972, 4:131). The ballad not only presumes Martinmas hospitality based on the abundance of sausage materials from the slaughter, but constellates many distinct carniva-</page><page sequence="7">Medieval English Martinmesse 237 lesque elements-night wanderers gorging themselves on puddings "white" and "black," threats of befouling (shaving the silent goodman with the pudding broth) and of cuckolding (kissing the goodwife), leading to the ultimate triumph of Woman over Man (the goodman is the first to break silence and must therefore get up and bar the door). A somewhat later ballad from Northumber- land, "Drunken Billy" (c. 1810), reinforces the idea of the Martin feast as a season for heavy drinking: Now it was about Martinmas last My mind was uneasy with thinking How foolish I spent my time past All ways a ramaling &amp; drinking (Bell 1985, no. 101). Similarly, the drinking bout in "The Fishpond" (Bell, no. 78) takes place on the "tenth of November," that is, Martinmas Eve. [3] These ballads reflect something of North Country Martinmas, of a decidedly rural character, from the seventeenth century and perhaps quite a bit earlier. We might suppose that something similar existed for southern England, in the centuries prior to Shakespeare's lifetime, though it would be overly optimistic to expect to find such a detailed "folk" statement of Martinmas motifs from a genuinely medieval layer. The inclusion of Spencer among our literary shards should alert us to the fact that most, if not all, of the Elizabethan/Jacobean Martinmas references quoted above might be deliberately archaic, if not indeed nostalgic. The antiquarian William Stukeley (1687-1765), for example, mistook the etymology of Martinshal, an ancient fortified hill in Wiltshire. He assumed it to be cognate with wassail and thus referred to the Saxon/Danish Martinalia or "drinking of healths in honour of St Martin" (Stukeley 1724, 131). He was unaware of thirteenth-century forms of the name (Matlesore, Mattelesore) which do not support this thesis. Whether Stukeley followed a local, popular etymol- ogy, or indeed created one, it is true that Martinshal was a site for autumnal gatherings. We might also point to an "Elizabethan" forgery a la Chatterton, "Martilmasse Daye," which was often quoted in nineteenth-century folkoric encyclopedias, the error perpetuated in even more recent scholarlship. [4] With false, "intrusive" artefacts such as these, it becomes even harder to penetrate to a genuinely medieval stratum. Early Tudor Evidence At the level just below that of a firmly established English Reformation, however, it is possible to discern something like an archaeological "horizon." Early Tudor literary references to the celebration and the ambience of Martinmas are few but telling. In The Debate and Stryfe betwene Somer and Wynter (c. 1530), Lord Winter advances the argument: Somer men make greate Joy what tyme I com in For companyes gadareth togyther on eue of seynt martyn Ther is nother great nor small but than they wyll drinke wyne If they sholde lay theyr cote to gage to drynke yt or it fyne (Ashbee 1869, no. 12 lines 15-21).</page><page sequence="8">238 Martin W. Walsh Similar praise of Martinmas can be found in the late fourteenth-century German "Streit zwischen Herbst [November] und Mai" and in several of Hans Sachs's Winter vs. Summer poems (Walsh 1994, 158-60). The emphasis here on the broad appeal of the feast, even to the poorly provided, is noteworthy. In the late fifteenth-century ballad version of the Gawain story, "The Grene Knight," Martin is intimately associated with a toasting ritual during the bleak early winter of Gawain's travels: "He cheered the Knight &amp; gave him wine/&amp; said, 'welcome by St Martine!"' (Percy 1868, 2:70). [5] Robert Copland's "The Hye Way to the Spyttell Hous" (c. 1536) well captures the onset of winter at Martinmastide: About a fourtenyght after Halowmas I chaunced to come be a certayn spyttell Where I thought best to tary a lytell And vnder the porche for to take socour To bye the passyng of a stormy shour For it had snowen/and frosen very strong With great ysesycles on the eues long The sharp north wynd hurled bytterly And with blacke clouds/darked was the sky (Copland 1993, 191-2 lines 10-17). "About a fourtenyght after Halowmas [31 October]" would put us at 12 or 13 November, early within the Octave of St Martin. The poem, moreover, depicts a teaming world of "trewant beggers" in the spirit of Brant's Narrenschiff and parallels several Bosch- and Bruegel-derived St Martin engravings (Walsh 1998). Season and subject-matter, then, equally refer to the Martin tradition, even though neither the saint nor his feast are mentioned directly. The saint's day was personified, a half century before Marlowe and Shake- speare, in the nonsense the character Mater employs to expel worms in the grotesque interlude Thersites (c. 1537): The mawe of the morecocke that made Mawd to mowe, When Martylmas at Moreton morened for the snowe. [The liver of the moorcock which caused Maud to mock/jest, When Martinmas at Moorton [Oxfordshire] mourned/pined for the snow] (Axton 1982, 58 lines 739-40). Again we have a linkage of winter's threshold with jesting play in the per- sonified holiday. In the late fifteenth-century Scots burlesque, Colkelbie Sow, mention is made of a dance tune "'Joly Mertene' with a mok," which seems to suggest a similar context (Kratzman 1983, 66). These references serve to anchor Martinmas celebration in an aboriginal calendar, even though major changes had taken place over the later medieval centuries. Improvements in agriculture, and in particular in the production of winter fodder, had no doubt considerably modified the extensive slaughter of meat-animals in what the Anglo-Saxons had once called the "blood month," diminishing the role of the carnivorous feast of Martinmas. The Martinmas wine asssociations were apparently somewhat longer lived. What then is the actual evidence for the medieval celebration of Martinmesse?</page><page sequence="9">Medieval English Martinmesse 239 The Martin Cult in England The cult of St Martin of Tours existed in Britain apparently from Roman times as evidenced by the ancient dedications of St Martin's, Canterbury, and Ninian's Candida Casa in Whithorn, Galloway. It was given further impetus by Celtic monasticism's close, even familial, ties with Martin and his city of Tours (Patrick was supposedly his nephew, Ninian his pupil; Columcille took away a gospel resting on Martin's corpse; Columbanus stopped to visit Martin's tomb despite the threat of death, and so on). There are at least three early St Martin churches in Cornwall, with one of the Scilly Islands preserving his name as well. The Martin chapel (c. 712) at Manchey Island near Wedmore, Somerset and St Martin's, Brampton built within a Roman fort on Hadrian's Wall and possibly founded by Ninian, further testify to the saint's early popularity along Britain's "Celtic fringe." Six of the eight Martin well dedications in England are at Roman sites, moreover (Rathue 1995, 64). The Anglo-Saxon church did not promote Martin's cult to any greater extent, but there were some major Martinian dedications such as the monastery at Dover founded by Wihtred, King of Kent (c. 700) according to William of Malmesbury. Several Old English homilies for Martinmas were composed; and Martin's summer feast of 4 July (Translatio et ordinatio), corresponding to Old Midsummer, was also observed together with 11 November in the calendars compiled before 1100. [6] With the coming of the Normans (whose duchy numbers Martinian churches in the hundreds), we begin to get records of celebrations on Martin's feast day. Naturally they crop up in places with a Martinian dedication; however, these include most of the major towns of the realm-Birmingham, Chester, Colchester, Exeter, Hereford, Leicester, Lincoln, Oxford, Salisbury, Shrewsbury, Stamford, Winchester and Worcester, with two Martin churches in York and six in London, to list just some of the more prominent. Rural parishes dedicated to Martin are also well distributed throughout the realm from the Lake District to Kent, from Devon to Lincolnshire, with several village names surviving into modem times, such as Barford St Martin, Wiltshire; Sandford St Martin, Oxfordshire; and Martinstown, Dorset. The city of Leicester had a processional image of Martin in the late fifteenth century and Colchester apparently had a "Seynt Martyns pley" in 1527 (Lancashire 1984, 165 and 114). No doubt there were other such enactments elsewhere, among these many English Martinian dedications. At the very beginning of the Norman regime, Battle Abbey (Sancto Martino de Bello) was dedicated to Martin. The Conqueror himself was supposed to have promised the saint a foundation if successful in his invasion of England. He is also said to have vowed that wine would flow as freely on the sandy land at Battle as water in other, better situated, abbeys (Searle 1974, 22). What is incontrovertible is that Martin's own monastery of Marmoutier in Tours became Battle Abbey's parent house. Clear indications of the extent and popularity of the Martin cult in the following century can also be found in the lives of early Norman bishops. St Hugh of Lincoln had a special devotion to Martin. His biographer, Adam of Eynsham, draws a quite detailed comparison between Hugh and his illustrious predecessor, even down to similar eccentricities (Douie and Farmer 1961, 2:199-</page><page sequence="10">240 Martin W. Walsh 208). Matthew Paris included a similar, if shorter, comparison of Martin with the subject of his Life of St Edmund (c. 1250). On his deathbed in the November of 1200, Hugh of Lincoln prayed that he might die on Martin's feast day. As it turned out, he expired on 17 November, within the Octave of the feast. Hugh the Chanter records this epitaph for another archbishop, Thomas of York who died in 1100: Octauis sancti Martini transit ille, Cui pietate Dei sit comes in requie! [St Martin's Octave (18 Nov.) was the day he died God grant him rest by good St Martin's side] (Johnson 1990, 20-1). An anecdote told of Thomas Becket while Chancellor of England (1155-62) shows yet another face of the Martin cult in the twelfth century, one decidedly secular. The by then familiar icon of the "Charity of St Martin" was evidently available for parodic play. Becket's clerk William Fitzstephen recounts the following as an example of the strong mutual friendship and high-spirits shared by Henry II and his Lord Chancellor, who would "sport together like boys of the same age." One "hard winter" day the two were riding through London and the king observed a poor old man approaching clad only in a thin, ragged coat: "Do you see that man?" said the king to the Chancellor. "Yes, I see him," replied the Chancellor. "How poor he is, how feeble, how scantily clad," said the king. "Would it not be an act of charity to give him a thick warm cloak?" "It would indeed, and you, O king, ought to have a mind and an eye to it." In the meantime the poor man came up to them. The king and the Chancellor both stopped. The king greeted him pleasantly and asked him if he would like a good cloak. The poor man, not knowing who they were, thought this was a jest and not meant to be taken seriously. Said the king to the Chancellor, "You shall have the credit of this act of charity," and laying hands on his hood he tried to pull off the cape the Chancellor was wearing, a new and very good one of scarlet and grey, which he struggled hard to keep. A great din and commotion then arose, and the knights and nobles in their train hastened up wondering what was the cause of this sudden strife between them ... Both of them had their hands fully occupied, and more than once seemed likely to fall off their horses. At last the Chancellor reluctantly allowed the king to overcome him, and suffered him to pull the cape from his shoulders and give it to the poor man. The king then explained what had happened to his attendants. They all laughed loudly, and some of them offered their own capes and cloaks to the Chancellor. The poor man walked off with the chancellor's cape, joyful and rich beyond expectation, and giving thanks to God (Greenaway 1961, 44-5). Henry apparently found the replication of the season and personae of the famous Amiens incident in the Vita Martini to be irresistible. He turns Becket into a reluctant Martin of the Charity in what might well be called a festival jest, although the Martin holiday is not specifically recalled. Records of the English Martinmesse To return to hard evidence for the celebration of Martinmas, the Chronicle of Battle Abbey records what is evidently a drunken argument over hospitality during the "winter feast of the community's patron, St Martin" in 1135. The</page><page sequence="11">Medieval English Martinmesse 241 bishop of Chichester, who had long wished to establish his authority over Battle, had been invited by the abbot to partake of the festivities but, Members of the bishop's retinue, men elevated by ambition and perhaps heated with the local wine, pompously reproved the cellarers and servants of the abbey, and as if they were speaking for their lord ... tried to extort what they wanted by threats of his authority (Searle 1980, 139). An incident from the fifteenth-century annals of the Vicars-Choral of York Minster recounts another drink-inspired altercation: On the feast of St Martin, 1421 in the hall, John Hedon became disorderly and propounded inane questions, uttering opprobrious words against his companions. He was fined 12d. (Harrison 1952, 60). These scraps of information suggest that Martinmas feasts were often occasions of excess, as on the continent. In the German-speaking area, for example, we have at least two instances of Martinmas inebriation leading to surprise attacks on the revellers by their enemies (Walsh 1994, 141-2). The Cellarers' Rolls of Battle Abbey preserve records of "wine bought for St Martin's feast and other occasions for guests, 7s. 6d." (1369), or "for wine at Martinmas, Christmas, and the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, 17s. 2d." (1385), as well as a 1382 record for "distributing to the poor on St Martin's Day, 10s." (Searle and Ross 1967, 62, 81 and 78). The relative size of a monastic Martinmas feast can be glimpsed in the 1492 Diet Roll of St Swithun's Priory, Winchester. For the Sunday of the Festum Sancti Martini Episcopi beef, mutton, calves feet, "numbles" and wine were laid on to the tune of ?1. 12s. 8d., as compared with only 10s. 9d. for Christmas, or 9s. id. for Ephipany (Kitchin 1892, 309 and 314-15). Martinmas was three times as large a feast! This probably reflected a substantial presence of the local poor. For St Martin-in-the-Fields, London we find an outlay of 3s. 4d. "for the Clerks Dynners, on Saynct martyns Daye" in 1556, and 3s. "to the Syngynge men on Saynct Martyns Daye" in 1557 (Kitto 1901, 166 and 173). In St Martin Outwich, London we find 5s. paid "on Saint Marten's day" 1517 for "bred and drynke for the syngers," as well as bread, ale, wine and rose garlands for "Seynt Marten's day, ye translation" in 1524-25 (Nichols 1797, 272-3). Martin's 4 July summer feast was also celebrated with garlands at St Martin-in-the-Fields, according to a 1556 record from that church (Kitto 1901, 165). The 1617 "revel day" at St Martin's, Fivehead in Somerset, for which the parish clerk sold a specially brewed ale, was also likely to have been the feast of Martin's Translation and remained in that rural church's Prayer Book calendar (Stokes 1996, 751-3). Moving away from Martinian religious foundations, we find a rather exten- sive set of Martinmas records for the Chester Cordwainers and Shoemakers guild through the middle of the sixteenth century. Payments to "menstreles" or "wyete men" (waits) on "martens daie" or "martenes en at nethe" are comple- mented by rather generous payments of "the shotte" for drink on "sent martens even," as much as three shillings in one entry (Clopper 1979, 47-52 and 117). Similar payments for Martinmas minstrels can be found in the accounts of Clare College, Cambridge for 1554 (Nelson 1989, 1:189). Martin as patron of the Chester shoemakers deserves further exploration. It is obvious that Martin's patronage of soldiers, tailors and cloakmakers, taverners</page><page sequence="12">242 Martin W. Walsh and wine merchants, relates directly to his vita or to his calendar position. For less obvious reasons Martin was also, in places, the patron of millers and those festival-prone and literarily prolific shoemakers. The abundance of hides at the end of the Martinmas slaughter might partially account for this latter connection. In France, Martin was the patron of a wide range of leather-related guilds: tanners, leather-dressers, parchment-makers, morocco- and chamois-leather workers, glovers, purse-makers, and so on (De Segange 1887, 2:595-634). Shoe- makers donated the thirteenth-century Martin window in Chartres cathedral, for example, and Cordwainers were responsible for the St Martin pageant in the Corpus Christi processions of Aberdeen in the early sixteenth century (Lan- cashire 1984, 310). As late as 1630 in a university play, The Marriage Broker by one "M. W.," we find plans for revelling on the feast day of "good Saint Crispin/ Saint Martin's play-fellow" (Baillie 1984, 123 and 299). Crispin/Crispianus is 25 October, hardly more than a fortnight before Martinmas and, as well as being the anniversary of Agincourt, is the feast day of the twin patron saints of cobblers. The former monastery grounds and sanctuary of St Martin-le-Grand (dissolved 1548), hard up against the slaughter-yards of Smithfield, were well known for cobblers' shops in the Tudor period. Dekker's Simon Eyre in The Shoemakers' Holiday enjoins his men to "fight for the honour of the Gentle Craft, for the gentlemen Shoomakers, the couragious Cordwainers, the flower of saint Martins " (Act 1 scenel). Thomas Deloney in the second part of The Gentle Craft (1598) recalls a master shoemaker known as the "greene king of S. Martin's," famous for his "merry feats" and extravagant hospitality. He would parade through the City at the head of an enormous retinue dressed in a suit all of green satin and wielding a two-handed sword with which he might threaten to lop off his sour opponents at the knees and make them "stand, like Saint Martin's beggar, upon two stilts" (Deloney 1903, 104). Like Falstaff, here was another carnival king under the mantle of St Martin. Summarising these fourteenth- to sixteenth-century records, we find conspicu- ous feasting supplemented by musical entertainment for a variety of institutions for whom the saint was important. The high incidence of mid-sixteenth century records probably reflects the partial revival of saint's day celebrations under Mary Tudor. Fragmentary though these records are, we can point to two conspicuous royal feasts which also belonged to the celebration of Martinmas. We have notice of a royal Martinmas in 1527 from the French historian Martin Bellay, who was part of a diplomatic mission to the court of Henry VIII. Evidently Martin's Eve was selected as a particularly appropriate date on which to celebrate the new Anglo-French Treaty: We were on Saint MARTINS day invited by the King to Greenwich to a Banquet the most sumptuous that ever I beheld, whether you consider the dishes, or the Maskes and Playes, wherein the Lady MARY the King's Daughter acted a part (Godwyn 1630, 82). The events on this 10 November and succeeding days included: a joust; the performance of a politico-religious play Cardinalis Pacificus by John Rightwise performed by the Children of Paul's; a disguising or pageant which included a fountain with a mulberry and hawthorn tree; and four masques in which not only the eleven-year-old Princess Mary participated, but her father as well.</page><page sequence="13">Medieval English Martinmesse 243 Several important tournaments took place during the Octave of St Martin in the reign of Henry VII and in the early years of Henry VIII, evidently taking advantage of "St Martin's Summer" before winter proper put an end to such activities. Among them are the coronation tournament of 1485 (13 November), the 1494 tournament honouring Prince Henry as Duke of York; the 1501 tournament for the wedding of Prince Arthur and Katherine of Aragon (14 November)-all at Westminster-and the 1510 joust and running-at-the-ring at Richmond in which the youthful new king participated (Streitberger 1994, 236-56). Indoor entertainments were prominent as well, witness: "1497 Nov. 11th. Item to iiij mynmystrelx [minstrels] in rewarde ... xxxiiij s. iiij d"; and "1498 Nov. 11th. Item to Jacques Haulte for the disguysing ... xx li" (Anglo 1960, 31 and 34). Jacques Haulte received the same fee for the same service at the end of November 1494, and he appears as the leading figure in production of court entertainments during the extensive Christmas season. There are similar records for early November disguisings or mummeries in 1493, 1501, 1510 and 1520, all of which suggest that early Tudor Court revels were fully engaged by 11 November, Martinmas perhaps serving as the "curtain raiser" for the winter revelling season as a whole. [7] The Jacobean antiquarian, John Stow, in his Annales of England, recorded another royal Martinmas a century and a half earlier in 1357 which has become part of the popular history of London, the so-called "Feast of the Five Kings": Henry Picard, Vintner, Mayor of London, in one day did sumptuously feast Edward, King of England, John, King of France, the King of Cipres (then arrived in England), David King of Scots, Edward Prince of Wales, with many noble men and other, and after the said Henry Picard kept his hall against all commoners whosoever, that were willing to play at dice and hazard (Kingsford 1917, 119-20). Scholarship has whittled down the actual royal company to three and deter- mined the date of the feast as on or about 13 November (Kingsford 1917, 119-26; Crawford 1977, 263-7). It seems clear that this was a Martinmas feast. It is well within the Octave and Martin was, moreover, the patron saint of the Vintners' Company. Records from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century show that the Master and Wardens of the Vintners' Company were chosen and presented to the City government on Martinmas. The elaborate Master's Feast occured on 11 November or, alternatively, on the Feast of Martin's Translation in July. The Martinmas feast of 1508, for example, was heavy on pike, eels and lampreys with much ale, beer and wine, while that of 1513 included "one Paycock and a Swan" valued at nine shillings (the present day Vintners still maintain the ritual of "swan upping"). Other key events in the life of the Company, such as confirmations of their charter, or significant disciplinary actions regarding qual- ity-control, also tended to cluster around the Martinian festivals (Overall 1869, 404-23). Add to this the office of Lord Mayor falling to the Vintners in 1357, and we have indeed a special reason to raise Martinmas hospitality to new heights. It is interesting that Henry Picard, after feasting the kings, "kept his hall" for the benefit of the commons and particularly for games of "hazard," activities usually associated with the Twelve Days of Christmas. "The Feast of the Five Kings" then tends to confirm the position of Martinmas as the beginning of the revelling season, for at least as early as the fourteeenth century. At the dawn of the</page><page sequence="14">244 Martin W. Walsh eighteenth-century the Vintner's were also responsible for a major revel which included a double impersonation of St Martin as enthroned bishop and as young soldier of the Charity, on the streets of London in the Lord Mayor's Show penned by the former Poet Laureate, Elkanah Settle (Walsh 1992). Martinmas and the Agricultural Cycle At the other end of the social spectrum, Martinmas also served as an important demarcation point. It was a traditional date in the high Middle Ages for terminating late harvest tasks owed one's lord, such as the sowing of winter wheat; for the beginning of such winter duties as that of the bull "storers"; or for the paying of various tallages (Homans 1941, 294-5, 355 and 372). Medieval records for Oxfordshire show Martinmas as payment date for such fees as the "church-scot," "salt-sylver," and "warde-penny," due the priest, lord of the manor, and sheriff respectively (Kennett 1816, 44, 125 and 154-5). Martinmas was also the date around which new agricultural hirings were organised, particularly in the north of England and in Scotland where Martin- mas was also a legal "quarter day." One would presume these traditions are at least a few centuries old before they take definite shape in Early Modem accounts. They perhaps go as far back as the period following the Black Death which had significantly loosened the ties of feudalism and created a class of wandering agricultural labourers who were much in demand. Martinmas hiring fairs are recorded for pre-Industrial Nottinghamshire, Gloustershire, Lincoln- shire and the town of Liverpool. Hiring was also a feature of Rugby's Marltemas Fair (Wright 1940, 164-6). Northampton's fair was established in the late thirteenth century and extended from St Martin's Day to the end of the Octave, while the Martinmas Fair of the village of Deddington in the Cotswolds also earned the nickname, "Pudden-Pie Fair" in honour of the abundant sausages there consumed (Briggs 1979, 36; Moore 1985, 21 and 298-9). Cupar in Fifeshire also had a Martinmas Market and hiring fair. The farming and account books of the Yorkshire yeoman Henry Best well document hiring rituals for the early seventeenth century, giving the impression of quite a lot of migratory traffic during Martinmastide. Best writes of petty constables establishing "sitting or statute days" in each division of the Riding for "masters that want servants, and servants that want masters." The first of these days is: A weeke or more afor Martynmasse, and the next three or fower dayes after that ... servants will usually give their olde masters a day, some two dayes, and some will stay three dayes with theire olde masters, and goe away on the fowerth day after Martynmasse. They stay usually two or three dayes with theire friends, and then aboute the fifth or sixth day after Martynmasse will they come to theire newe masters (Best 1857, 134-5). Folkways recorded in the same East Riding some two hundred years later include carnivalesque feasting: Farm lads and lasses have a week holiday at Martinmas, and on Martinmas Sunday a grand dinner is provided for them at their homes, and to this such ample justice is done that the day has received a special name-Rive Kite Sunday (Tear Stomach Sunday). A "yat yal</page><page sequence="15">Medieval English Martinmesse 245 posset" (hot ale posset), ale heated, sweetened with treacle, and spiced, is considered a proper drink for the day (Nicholson 1890, 29). In Scotland the "Martinmas foy" was a special farewell supper for the departing ploughmen. Partings from old masters at Martinmastide did not always partake of this geniality, however. Again from the East Riding comes the protest rhyme: Good Morning, Mr Martinmas You've come to set me free. For I don't care for master And he don't care for me (Knightly 1986, 158). while Best had earlier recorded this bit of rebellious doggerel: I can sowe, I can mowe, And I can stacke, And I can doe, My master too, When my master turnes his backe (Best 1857, 136). [8] The ubiquitous icon of St Martin's Charity also seems to have cued Best's outlays of footwear and clothing to his hired help, obviously an important concern at the onset of winter: 1632, Martynmas. Layd out for the swynerd for a pair of shoes, 16d., for 2 skinnes for his breeches, and thred, Id., lyninge, 11d., and for mending his clothes, 3d. and heele hobbs, 2d. or, Agnes Scadlocke to have 15s., and a pair of showes, besides her godspenny, from the tyme shee came till Martynmasse 1620 (Best 1857, 160 and 153). [9] In early nineteenth-century Yorkshire, moreover, Martinmas signalled the time to begin the perambulations of mummers and female carolling groups, parallel- ing, as it were, the commencement of Court revels. Martinmas as an important term-date had other survivals in Britain of some antiquity. A tithe of "Wroth Silver" is still paid into the stump of an ancient cross on Knightlow Hill, Warwickshire before dawn on Martinmas by represen- tatives of the twenty-five parishes in the Knightlow Hundred. The practice can be traced back to 1236. Interestingly from the perspective of Martinmas slaugh- ter, failure to pay by dawning light might result in the forfeit of a "white bull with red ears and a red nose," a description of the wild white cattle once common in England (Shuel 1985, 123-4; Knightly 1986, 237-8). In Bradford, Yorkshire the eighteenth-century antiquary John Hartley re- counted a Martinmas payment ritual associated with the slaying of a huge, ravenous wild boar and the rival claims of two hunters to having performed the feat. The true slayer of the boar was eventually awarded with a parcel of land: Known by the name of Hunt-Yard, and for the tenure of which he, and his heirs for ever, should annually attend in the marketplace at Bradford on St Martin's-Day in the forenoon,</page><page sequence="16">246 Martin W. Walsh and there, by the name of the heir of Rushforth, hold a dog of the hunting kind, whilst three blasts were blown on a Gelder's horn; and these words following expressed aloud, Come heir of Rushforth, come hold me my dog, whilst I blow three blasts of my horn to pay my Martinmas rent withal (Hartley 1776, 8-9). While it is clear that there are considerable accretions of legend upon the practice still current in Hartley's day, it is equally certain that it possessed a genuine historical kernel. John of Gaunt did grant properties to one John Northrop in 1342 with the stipulation of "rendering annually ... coming to Bradford, one blast with his horn upon St Martin's Day in Winter (unum flatum cornu ad festum Sancti Martini in hieme), and attending upon him and his heirs ... with a lance and a hunting dog (cum una lancea &amp; cane venatico), for the space of thirty days." Provisions for late autumnal boar-hunting are appropri- ately assigned to Martinmas, the slaughter feast. [10] An ancient pedigree can also be found for the Martinmas bull-running at Stamford, Lincolnshire, a folk practice I have dealt with extensively elsewhere (Walsh 1996). The puritanical antiquarian Richard Butcher described the event at some length in his The Survey and Antiquitie of the Towne of STAMFORD, In the County of LINCOLNE published in 1646: It is performed just the day six weekes before Christmas [13 November]. The Butchers of the Town at their own charge ... provide the wildest Bull they can get, this Bull over night is had in to some Stable or Barne belonging to the Alderman, the next morning proclamation is made by the common Bell-man of the Town ... that each one shut up their shops-doores and gates ... That none have any Iron upon their Bull-clubs or other staffe which they pursue the Bull with. Which proclamation made and the Gates all shut up, the Bull is turned out of the Aldermans house, and the hivie, skivie, tag and rag, Men, Women and children of all sorts and sizes, with all the Dogs in the Town promiscuously running after him with their Bull-clubs spattering dirt in each others faces that one would think them to be so many furies started out of Hell (Burton 1846, 50). The Stamford bull-running flourished until forcibly suppressed in the late 1830s. It had aquired numerous camivalesque traits including special props; some masquerading; its own anthem, folk sayings and mock encomia; playing with dirt and dung; and numerous special methods for maddening the bull, including "bridging" or heaving the bull by main force off the Stamford Bridge into the River Welland. Some of these practices may well have predated Butcher's account and "bridging" especially, with its river-boundary associations, seems particularly archaic. It is fairly certain that the general tradition dates back to at least the turn of the fourteenth century and was associated with the important church of St Martin, a Norman foundation. A 1389 return from Stamford's Guild of St Martin states that "on the feast of St Martin (11 November), this gild, by custom beyond reach of memory, has a bull; which bull is hunted [not baited] by dogs, and then sold; whereupon the brethern and sistern sit down to feast" (Smith and Smith 1870, 192). One might presume an earlier, complete sequence of: the guild procuring a bull; the bull-run; the slaughter of the animal; feasting upon its flesh by the confraternity; with perhaps then a further distribution to the needy in the spirit of St Martin's Charity. [11] Camrnivalesque blood-sport thus leads to communal sharing of resources under the mantle of the saint who guards winter's threshold. The Stamford material</page><page sequence="17">Medieval English Martinmesse 247 brings this out most clearly, but all the Martinmas folk practices outlined above share, to a greater or lesser extent, similar features. They indicate a very deep indentification of an historical saint with the activities of an early medieval, if not an aborginal, calendar. It would be a mistake to leap to neo-pagan conclu- sions here and find in Martin a disguised Germanic or Celtic god. [12] Neverthe- less, he does appear a likely candidate for such a role. There is a report from the reign of King Stephen recorded by William of Newburgh which evidently reflects the discovery of a pair of "wild children." [13] Near Bury St Edmund's was a village called Wolfpittes named for "some very ancient ditches": At harvest-time, when the harvesters were busy in the fields gathering the crops, two children, a boy and a girl, emerged from these ditches. Their entire bodies were green, and they were wearing clothes of unusual colour and unknown material. As they wandered bemused over the countryside, they were seized by the reapers and led to the village (William of Newburgh 1988, 115). The children refuse all human food until they are given newly shelled beans, upon which provender they subsist until they learn to eat bread. They also learn to speak English: Once they had the use of our language, they were asked who they were and where they came from. They are said to have replied: "We are people from St Martin's land; he is accorded special reverence in the country of our birth." [Homines de terra sancti Martini qui scilicet in terra nativitatis nostrae praecipuae venerationi habetur] (Scarfe 1986, 165-7; William of Newburgh 1988, 116-17). Upon further interrogation it is learned that they inhabit a twilight region separated from the realms of the sun by a river of great breadth, a traditional description of Fairie, apart from the fact that Christian churches also seem to exist there. [14] What is particularly germane to our inquiry is the harvest season (whose endpoint is marked by Martin's feast), the magic bean-food, and the green-hued wanderers among the sheaves. We appear to have a reference to the transposition of seasons between Fairie and Middle Earth with these very green children, younger cousins of Gawain's nemesis, in the golden harvest fields, a reversal that is also recalled in the weather expression "St Martin's Summer." Whether William of Newburgh's narrative reflects the actual discovery of feral children or is, perhaps, a garbled account of an atavistic harvest ritual is impossible to say. But in either case, Martin's patronage over the viridi pueri is extremely significant. The saint's position in the liturgical calendar apparently did coincide with other, older and deeper calendars, allowing him to sink, as it were, into the realm of Faerie and rule over at least its outer province, the Land of Cockaigne. We may well be at the lowest stratum of our "dig" with this Wolfpittes account. English Martinmas may well have had very deep roots in the aborginal past. Traces of blood sacrifice and prophylactic magic, so common in southern Irish Martinmas customs, can also be found in the Devonshire folk practice of "blooding the mill." Millers would kill a cock at midnight on the vigil of Martinmas and sprinkle its blood on their machinery to avoid future injuries. [15] Martinmas certainly was a significant calendar date-cum-festival season in the high Middle Ages, evidently more so in the north than in the south of the realm,</page><page sequence="18">248 Martin W. Walsh given the geographic distribution of the evidence here presented. It was almost completely effaced by the Reformation and the later Industrial Revolution, those two most potent forces working against traditional practices in England, as in Europe generally. But other, more local, factors were at work as well in diminishing its importance in the era whose literary shards we had examined earlier. Queen Elizabeth celebrated her accession on 17 November as, of course, did all her loyal subjects. A political holiday thus bivouacked in the ruins of the Octave of St Martin, ousting poor Hugh of Lincoln in the process. A later and even more popular political holiday, Guy Fawkes on 5 November, might well have siphoned off some of the more raucous, carnivalesque energies of the older Martlemas. [16] Couple these new foci for celebration with the reconstruction and inflation of the Christmas of "Merry England" from the Restoration onward, and it is not too surprising that Martinmas faded from memory. [17] And yet England will always produce its eccentric exceptions. Browne Willis, Lord of the Manor of Fenny Stratford, Buckinghamshire literally created his own Martinmas tradition with the building of a new parish church in 1730. This was to honour his grandfather who had died in St Martin's Lane, London on St Martin's Day 1675. A parish dinner, a commemorative sermon, and other entertainments were provided, including firing the "Fenny Poppers," a set of antique pop-guns which were set off periodically during the day (Shuel 1985, 187-8; Knightly 1986, 114-15). The tradition is still kept up today. Willis was such an eccentric antiquarian and philanthropist that he ruined his fortune and was often taken for a beggar in his later years. In a curious way he replicated the shabby, eccentric monk-bishop of Tours whose severed mantle became the aegis for a long-lived, if now mostly forgotten, festival. Notes [1] Variants of the term include Martylmas, Martymasse, Myrtynmes, Mertymes (O.E.D.) and Martinesmasse, Martilmas (Middle English Dictionary). Martinmas appears only briefly in recent surveys of early English festival practice. See esp. Hutton 1994 and Laroque 1991. The present study is the first devoted exclusively to the English Martinmas and its associations. [2] There is no reason to accept "martin = kind of monkey" as the oft-repeated gloss here, for example in the Penguin anthology (Nashe 1972, 108). Nashe's first degree of drunkenness is already "Ape drunke," and the seventh degree is "Maudlin drunke" which, of course, does not refer to an animal but rather to another saint, the tearful Mary Magdalene. "Martin drunk," as defined by Nashe, clearly refers to prolonged festive drinking rather than to animal fable/psychological aspects of drunkenness. Cotgrave's Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues notes the word martiner, used by Rabelais, to mean "to quaffe, swill, guzzle (from S. Martins day, when commonly the French people begin to drinke new wine)" (Cotgrave 1611). [3] Two other Bell pieces, no. 219 and no. 234, deal with November sausage-making ("white puddings"), as in "Get Up and Bar the Door." [4] Nathan Drake cites it as the work of a "modem poet" in 1817. Its opening lines are: "It is the day of Martilmasse,/Cuppes of ale should freelie passe" (Drake 1817, 1:191-3). Even as scrupulous a scholar as Ronald Hutton has perpetuated the error in his recent and otherwise authoritative The Stations of the Sun (Hutton 1996, 386). [5] Oaths "by Saint Martin" are conspicuously employed by both Sir John Boundes and his youngest son Gamelyn in the mid fourteenth-century Tale of Gamelyn.</page><page sequence="19">Medieval English Martinmesse 249 [6] Martin's winter feast was recognised by the Anglo-Saxons as early as the beginning of the eighth century in the Calendar of St Willibrord. Wells and Winchester, in addition, observed the end of the Octave of St Martin (18 November) in the Anglo-Saxon period (Wormald 1939, 148-176). St Martin coins from Lincoln (c. 920-40), bearing a sword on the obverse, are early evidence of Martin's cult in that area. [7] Jousts and disguisings, of course, belong to other seasons as well. The suggestion here is only that there appears to have been a particular clustering of such activities in the first fortnight of November. The genial Martin feast would seem the more likely "start up" date than the more sombre All Saints/All Souls of 1-2 November, although it must be remembered that in many households and colleges the "Lord of Misrule" was elected on 1 November (Streit- berger 1994, 8). Martinmastide might well have served a dual designation: as the last period for outdoor events such as tourneys, as well as the threshold for the long series of indoor winter revels. Streitberger also prints an 11 November record from 1554 in which the future Earl of Arundel requested from Sir Thomas Cawarden, Master of the Revels, a masque of "Alamains or sume other" for Arundel Place. Feasts for the newly appointed Serjeants-at-Law also tended to cluster at Martimastide in the reigns of Henry VII and Henry VIII. These were attended by royalty, important nobility and the Lord Mayor of London. The menu for the five-day feasting of 1532 beginning on Martinmas Eve seemed "almost incredible" to the antiquarian Dugdale and "wanted little of the Feast at Coronation." It certainly reflected the abundance of November slaughter with its "twenty four great Beefes ... one Carcass of an Oxe ... One hundred fat Muttons ... Fifty one great Veales ... Thirty four Porkes ... Ninety one Piggs," as well as eighteen dozen swans, thirty-seven dozen pigeons, and numerous other fowl (Dugdale 1666, 127-8). [8] Compare Caliban's song ('Ban, 'Ban, Ca-Caliban/Has a new master, get a new man) at the climax of the great comic scene of Act 2 of The Tempest (Walsh 1993), and an early twentieth-century example from Northeast Scotland: But Martinmas it has worn on, My fee's into my pouch; And sae merrily, merrily, I will sing, "I'm oot o' the tyrant's clutch" (Cameron 1978, 90). The converse, a hiring farmer's complaint, can be found in a 1792 Burns poem appearing in The Merry Muses of Caledonia : I fee'd a man at Martinmas, Wi' arle pennies three, But a' the fau't I had to him, He cou'dna labour lee (Burns 1968, 2:651). [9] It is possible that distribution or repair of servants' shoes at Martinmas (called calciamentum in medieval records) may have been another contributing factor in establishing Martin as a patron saint of shoemakers/cobblers. [10] Compare the porcine monsters Hwch ddu gwta (tailless Black Sow) in Welsh and the Muck Olla boar in Irish Halloween practice (Hole 1995, 130-3). See as well the quatrefoil relief carvings on the font in Holy Trinity Church, Hull, identified as "Martinmas," a man holding a boar-spear, and "Christmas," a boar's head with fruit in mouth (Wildridge 1899, 139). [11] A contributor to Notes and Queries in 1858 recounts how Wokingham, Berkshire attempted to reform a venerable bull-baiting instituted for charitable purposes. In 1661 George Staverton left a will stipulating four pounds a year for a bull to be baited at Christmastide and then cut up for the indigent ("one poor's piece not exceeding another's in bigness"), a bequest which must have underwritten an earlier practice. In 1822 the Corporation, in compliance with the Act against Cruelty to Animals, sought to eliminate the bull-baiting, continuing however the</page><page sequence="20">250 Martin W. Walsh slaughter and distribution of beef to the poor. This produced a series of uprisings on the part of the populace who would "liberate" the designated animal and conduct impromptu bull-runnings through the countryside. As late as 1835 such an animal was defiantly baited in the Wokingham marketplace. Jail sentences finally resulted in the suppression of these impromptu events. The bequest, the source further relates, now yields twenty pounds, enough for two beasts. Their flesh is distributed on St Thomas's Day (21 December) among some two to three hundred poor, the proceeds from the offal and hides going to purchase shoes and stockings for poor women and children, with the bulls' tongues going to the Alderman and the Town Clerk as a courtesy. We see in this High Victorian example the kind of activity that must also have characterised the Stamford's Guild of St Martin bull-run. It also demonstrates the intense desire on the part of a "modem" folk not to separate charitable impulses from carnivalesque sport (R. W. 1858, 35-6). [12] Nineteenth- and early twentieth-century German scholars (Wilhelm Mannhardt, Paul Her- rmann, Rudolf Hindringer, Erich Jung, Friedrich Drosihn, et al.) were particularly fond of identifying the image of the heavily mantled saint on his white horse with the wandering god Wotan. [13] Another version of the incident is given by Ralph of Coggeshall (De quodam puero et puella de terra emergentibus) in his Chronicon anglicanum. [14] Compare Paul S6billot's article, "Les fees chretiennes" (Sebillot 1889). [15] This is an early nineteenth-century, and presumably much earlier, Devonshire practice (Binnal 1943), cognate with the widespread practice of shedding prophylactic blood on Martinmas in southern Ireland (see esp. Morris 1939 and 0 Stiilleabiin 1957). [16] Bonfires were, and are, a conspicuous feature of Martinmas in the Low Countries and the Rhineland, but I have been unable to locate any references to English Martinmas fires which Guy Fawkes might have supplanted (see esp. Hole 1960). [17] That Martinmas retained some degree of importance at the end of the seventeenth century, witness the almanac evidence from Puritan New England. Printer John Tully of Saybrook, Connecticut restored various saints' days of the Anglican church calendar during the shortlived "Dominion of New England" (1687-9), a period in which the Puritan colonies were directly ruled from London. Martlemas thus made a brief appearance in the almanacs of what can only be considered Festival's "enemy territory" (see esp. Nissenbaum 1996, 18-20). References Cited Anglo, Sydney.
