<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Etymology of the Name Sappho By Giinther Zuntz, Manchester Prefatory Note This essay contains, in a revised form, the results of an investigation carried out more than ten years ago. It was left unpublished because one main result appeared to be contra dicted by the inscription on the Goluchow vase (below pp. 15 and 22). Competent friends have lately confirmed me in the opinion that this isolated piece cannot invalidate the over whelming evidence against ist. The reader will weigh the arguments for himself. The absence of accents and breathings on Greek words should not be taken for a matter of principle. The papyri have indeed shown that our Herodianic-Byzantine accentuation involves a good deal of fads and faults. Even so, we should be the worse for dispensing with it in standard Greek. The matter is different with regard to Aeolic and non-Greek words such as occur frequently in the present essay. The rule of Aeolic barytonesis seems too crude to be believable for every detail, and if the absence of initial aspiration from this dialect is a fact, the application of the soft breathing becomes a farce (even more so, that is, than where there is scope also for the sign of the rough breathing). Was I to print Σάπφω where the name is borne by a Lesbian woman, but Σαπφώ for a Phrygian or Karian ? And how in reference to Σάπφώ in general ? Moreover, who can tell which accent is due to Πιξωδαρος, Σηραμβος, Λαμαγα, or what is the quantity of the vowels in Phrygian Σαβν; and Pisidian Σαβίνα ? Not I. Hence I have chosen the better part of valour, leaving out all accents. t i. -■ denote a primitive and ill-defined substratum of Anatolian and neighbouring traditions, as though we were still in the days of the great pioneers A. H, Sayce and W. M. Ramsay. The writer is not in fact entirely unacquainted with the discoveries which, since the ex cavations of Tell-el-Amarna and Boghazkôy, have shown the early history of Asia Minor in a new light. His impression is that, much though we have learned about the succession and mingling of peoples and races, an unambiguous demarcation of their separate characters and relationships is not yet possible and that the traditional assumption of a common substratum retains its truth. In this view he feels fortified by the utterances of such author ities as E. Meyer and R. Dussaud. While these lines were being written, the first reports about the finds at Karatepe opened up the prospect of decisive new insights. The present investigations will sooner or later be tested by them. It remains for me to thank Sir John Beazley for a helpful discussion, ten years ago, about the inscriptions on Sappho vases and Sir John Myres for a most interesting correspondence on Aegean script. Professor H. W. Bailey, Dr. F. J. Tritsch and Dr. R. Pfeiffer have obliged me by valuable information on points of detail; I want to express my gratitude to them, as well as to J. A. Davison, W. B. Sedgwick and 0. Skutsch for their encouraging interest in my abstruse subject. Finally I want to thank the staff of the Kongelige Bibliotek at Copenhagen who in years past never tired in supplying my unlimited wants and thus made possible the present research. In rewriting it I could not draw on stores as rich; hence I could not in every case verify my earlier notes and had to do without much of the literature which has appeared since then. I particularly regret having been unable to consult recent works by K. Bittel, 6. Furlani and L. Delaporte. This fact does not reduce my gratitude to the staffs of the two Manchester libraries who most helpfully produced whatever was available.

Every truly Greek name has, by origin, a meaning. The inquiry into the origin of this particular name may throw some light upon the problème surrounding its greatest bearer; at the same time, it opens up some wider perspectives. I. The evidence Apart from the poetess there is the following evidence for this name : (1) A tombstone from Lesbos, I.G. XII 3, after C. Cichorius, Ath. Mitt. 13 (1888) 78 nr. 50 Σαπφώ χρηστη χαίρε The inscription is undated; it certainly is not old (? Roman). This Sappho appears to have been a slave and therefore is likely not to have been born on Lesbos, but to have corne from some région where the name was usual. (2) A dedication from Thespiae ( ? 3rd cent. B.C.), BCH 50 (1926) 414, nr. 26 (A. Plassart) Σαφφω το γένος Φρνγια Αρταμώί Ειλει&amp;ιη Α Phrygian woman at Thespiae, with no indication of father or husband, must have been a slave. (3) A warrant for a run-away slave, middle 3rd cent. B.C., Egypt, in C. E. Edgar, Zenon Paf yri III (1928) 117, nr. 59 374 ... παώισκην αυτου λαφφονν Καρινην ...

Νεμεριού Καστρικιου Λενκιον Πακωνιανον ασιαρχου και Ανρηλιας Σαπφούς Πλάτωνος Λικιννιανης αρχιερειας γυναικός αυτόν. These names suggest a date not earlier than the end of the 2nd cent. A.D. and probably mnch later. The accumulation of names is an Asianic characteristic1. We may add some preliminary observations. Nrs. (5) and (7) may possibly owe their name to a classicistic enthusiasm for the poetess2. The assumption is not necessary and it would be preposterous to extend it to ail bearers of the name. Only in the case of (5) is Greek descent to be assumed; (2) and (3) certainly, and the rest probably, belong to the native population of Asia Minor. Not once do we find the initial Ψ with which the poetess is supposed to have spelled her name. II. Greek etymologies The older dérivation of the name Sappho from the adjective σαφής, for which there is no parallel, was abandoned when scholars realised the fact—they regarded it as a fact—that originally the name began with Ps-. The first was J. Baunack3. His dérivation, from a hypothetical *Ψαλλεφιλα, is at best a curiosity. W. Prell witz, in his review of Baunack's book4, considered a "Zusammenhang mit dem ähnlichen Namen des attischen Demos Ψαφις nicht unmöglich". A. Fick5 approved of this connection to which he himself added the name of the Arcadian town Ψωφις. These place-names, of doubtful meaning, could not in themselves help very much towards the elucidation of the Lesbian proper name. Hence F. Solmsen gained wide assent when suggesting6 that both should be connected with the adjective ψαφαρός: he considered the possibility that Sappho's parents named their child after its "trockene, spröde Haut oder Haare". The suggestion is in questionable taste; the particular abbreviation ψαφαρος &gt; Ψαπφω would be hard to parallel and no Greek name derived from this adjective exists7. 1 See J. Sundwall, in Klio, Beiheft XI (1913) 266. 2 The same may, but need not, apply to the Sappho to whom Paulus Silentiarius ad dressed the erotic epigram Α Ρ V 246. - C. I. G. 3555 is actually one of the many epigrams on the poetess (Antipater Sid.; AP VII 15). 3 Studien auf dem Gebiete der griechischen ... Sprachen I (1886) 56. 4 Gött. Gel.

Lambertz (Glotta 4 [1912] 117) was not lucky in his endeavour to supply the want. Misreading Passow's lexicon, he indicated, first, what is actually a place-name, perhaps corrupt, in Macedonia: Αντιγόνη (read Αντιγονεια) Ψαφαρα (read Σκαβαλα ?) Ptol. III 12, 35 (sic). Lambertz's second instance is no better: the αρχιερευς Κ).. Ρσνφος ο και Ψαφαριος on a Roman inscription (IG XIV 956 A 2), whose date Mommsen identified as A.D. 313, bears a barbarian name: it recurs on an inscription from Thiounta, North of Hierapolis, in Phrygia. W. M. Ramsay, in publishing it, remarked upon the "utter want of Roman names" due to the secluded position of its barbarous place of origin (Cities and Bishoprics ... I [1895] 143, cf. 124f.). He who realises the derogatory implications in the (very rare) application of the adjective ψαφαρος to human beings (see [Eur.] Rh. 715; AP V 27 [Rufinus]; cf. Horn. Hymn. XIX 32) will not expect a Greek personal name ever to have been derived from it; least of ail for a member of the Lesbian aristocracy.</page><page sequence="4">On the Etymoloey of the Name Sappho 15 This etymology then is untenable. Another suggestion of A. Fick could seem to have been borne out by a recent discovery. He compared Ψαπφω to tbe man's name Ψαψων which be knew from a Cyrenean inscription. F. Bechtel, wbo had discussed the latter name8, wavered as to its relation to Sappho'1, which was adopted by F. Solmsen10 and E. Maass11. The recent Italian excavations at Cyrene, besides adding to the evidence for the male name12, have produced an instance of the cognate feminine Ψαφωι12Ά. The oldest picture purporting to represent Sappho, on the Goluchow amphora of about 510-500 B.C.13, has the inscription ΦΣΑΘΟ. The person who wrote the inscription was not an authority on spelling : he scratched a 0 for a ψ—paral lele for this kind of error are not wanting14—but he evidently meant Ψαφω. The agreement with the Cyrenean inscription would seem to establish the relation between Ψαψων and Sappho. In spite of appearances, I submit that Psaphon-Psapho and Sappho are un related, for (1) the former are conhned to Donc; the régions where Σαπφώ occurs are, to say the least, non-Doric; (2) Ψαφων is most probably related to ψαφος ; it maymean a "draughts-player". In any case it had a long â, for the noun ψήφων is attested15. The name then ought to be Ψήφων, fern. Ψηφω in Attic and Koine Greek. But all writers refer to the poetess as Σαπφώ and this is the spelling used for the one Attic bearer of the name, as well as for all others. The α in Σαπφώ apparently is short16; a name Ψηφω or Σηφω does not exist; (3) the assumed connection between Ψαφων and Σαπφώ fails to account for the 8 Die einstämmigen männl.

Mus. 75 (1926) 358. 12 The evidence for Ψαφων is by now as follows ; (a) from Cyrene : four inscriptions of the 4. and 3. cent. B.C.; see G. Oliverio in Africa Italiana 3 (1930) 187 (= Smith-Porcher, Recent Discoveries ... [1864] 110 = SEG IX [1938] nr. 50); id. ib. 177 (= SEG IX nr. 46); id. ib.

XXIX 4; (b) the name occurs also on Rhodian jar-handles which for lack of the relevant literature I cannot identify, but see CIG III, p. XX nr. 200 and E. Pridik in Klio 20 (1925/6) 331. 12a G. Oliverio in Doc. Afr. D., vol. II, Cirenaica, fasc. I (1933) p. 116, nr. 112 (= SEG IX nr. 224). Judging from the photograph (Oliverio pl. XXXII fig. 68) the inscription may be ascribed to the 2. cent. B.C. 13 Corp. Vas. Ant., Poland I 16; cf. J. Beazley, Creek Vases in Poland (1928) 9. On the vases in Munich (Furtwängler-Reichhold pl. 64) and Athens ( J. Beazley, RFV p. 702. 102) the name begins with sigma. 14 Ε. g. in Δημοϋ-ων and Αριστονοφος, see P. Kretschmer, Die griechischen Vaseninschriften (1894)11.102.232. 15 Hesychius s. v. ; Manetho, Apotel. V 277. 16 The problem did not escape Solmsen (loc. laud. 502) and Maass (loc. laud. 359). It led the former to refer Ψαφων to ψαφαρος rather than to ψαφος. Maass would ascribe the (assumed) shortening of the vowel to the doubling of the following consonant, comparing thessal. Ααμματηρ: he was, I suppose, unable to find a more convincing parallel. Neither device will bear examination.</page><page sequence="5">16 Günther Zuntz most puzzling, and most suggestive, feature of the latter, namely the (apparent) Variation between Ψ and Σ in its initial. The latter problem requires some detailed investigation. F. Bechtel17 indeed, followed by E. Maass, endeavoured to eut it short. He presented the name Σαψις as identical with Ψαψων and demonstrating the équivalence of their initiais. The former name occurs on IG IV 732 Αριστον (sic) Σαφιος. But Σαφις was an Arab. IG IV 728-735 is a sériés of Hellenistic inscriptions listing the members of the Demeter mysteries at Hermione in Argolis. A notable feature is the high percent age, at this provincial place, of initiâtes of foreign, and particularly of oriental origin. Probably they were slaves. We find, in nr. 72918, a Λιβυς Σηραμβω, a Κιτος, an Ανανϋος Τρεν&amp;ω and Βαρις Μαργω19. On nr. 73120 there appear Σνρια Σωκλεους, Λαμαγα and Σινδης21 together with two différent Αμμια. Finally, on nr. 732, Σαψις is in the Company of Αραπια, of Λιβυς Δαμονικον, of Αμμια, Ισεια, Εισιδωρος and Σαμβατει;22 : indeed a very oriental Company. Σαψις has no roots in Greek society—as little as in Greek etymology. But he has namesakes on Egyptian sherds23. The name is explained by E. Littmann24 as identical with Arabie Safi25. Çafi the Arab cannot demonstrate that the Greek name Ψαγων could begin, now with a psi and now with a sigma. III. Ψ and Σ Wherever in her poems Sappho quotes her own name, its initial is spelled Ψ ; wherever other writers refer to her, it is Σ. The différence can either be accounted for by the assumption of some phonetic developnient, or it can be described as merely orthographie and thus eliminated. So far, only the former alternative has been tried. J. Baunack26 and F. Solmsen27, 17 Die hist.

The same root however is found in Σινδος in Macedonia, Σινδα in Pisidia, Σινδησσο^ in Karia. Σινδιτα in Cappadocia; see A. Fick, Vorgriech.

Schulze, is a devotee of the goddess Sambethe of Thvateira (Kleine Schriften [1933] 290); perhaps Semitic and identical with Sabitu of the Giigamesh epic (see M. I. Lagrange, Etudes Sém. [1905] 358). According to M. Lidzbarski (Ephemeris 2 [1903] 137) and E. Littmann (in Preisigke's Namenbuch 524), she is an ob server of the sabbath. At any rate, Sambateis is a slave of Eastern descent; probably Semitic and certainly not Greek; cp. L. Robert, BGH 58 (1934) 516. 23 P. Viereck, Ostraka ... Strassburg 215, nr. 649/10; R.

The use of the term in the présent case amounts to a lex in personam. When the words of this type are mustered—ψαφαρος, Ψαφις, ψήφος, Ψωφις, ψεφηνος, ψοφος —, not one of them is found to have an alternative form beginning with mere s-29. It was therefore a better idea to look out, without refer ence to "dissimilation", for other words where initial ψ- might be found replaced by σ-, A. Fick has given a fairly long list of such words30. It is telling that he could not include a single one of the words in current use—such as ψαλμός, ψανω, ψευδός, ψιλός, ψαμμος, ψυχη—although a proper phonetic law ought to have affected them in the first place. The few out-of-the-way instances which Fick brought together, mainly from unverifiable glosses in Hesychius, cannot prove the point.31. Even if a few, rarely used Greek words may have shown, at différent times and/or places, an initial s- for ps-, this fact affords no sufficient explanation of the most striking feature of the name Sappho. While the poetess appears to have called herself Psappho, Herodotus and Platon, the Marmor Parium, Strabo, Plutarch, Maximus of Tyre and whosoever refers to her use the form with initial s which is common also with all other bearers of the name (it is as though Sophocles had vainly striven to be called Psophocles). This overwhelming amount of evidence cannot be discounted and ascribed to a subséquent phonetic development, for Alcaeus, her contemporary and countryman, in addressing her uses the same form. His line ιοπλοκ' αγνα μελλιχομειδε Σαπφοι by its apparent contrast with the poetess' own usage yields the solution towards which the discussion has all the time been tending. The phoneme (sit venia verbo) by which Alcaeus addressed her cannot be supposed to have been markedly différent from that which Sappho used herself. Its initial cannot have been a psi, for the double consonant would have effected, in poetry, the lengthening of a preceding short vowel. It is notable that no short vowel occurs, in this position, in Sappho's poems; it is décisive that the line of Alcaeus just quoted would be ruined by the 28 See e.g. RE s. v. ; P. Kretschmer, Die griech. Vaseninschriften (1894) 182; E. Schwyzer, Oriech. Gramm. (1939) 260. 29 Aeolic inscriptions in particular have always ψαφος, ψαφιζω, see 0. Hoffmann, Die grie chischen Dialekte II (1893) 281. 30 Beitr. 26 (1901) 114. 31 E. Schwyzer, Zeitschr. f. vergl. Sprachforsch. 58 (1931) 170, has shown that ψιττ(α) σιττ(α) (cf. ψίθυρος) are alternative onomatopoietical renderings of a voice-sound ("[pjsst"). The same may be held with regard to ψοι&amp;ης (Theognostus) and σοιθης (Hes.; cf. ψι&amp;νρος ?) and σελλιζομαι (Hes.) beside ψελλιζομαι - if indeed the two words are identical. Identity may be doubted also with regard to σαλαγει ααλαξαι (Hes.) and ψαλασσω. In ασεκτος (Rhinton), from ψεγω, the -a- is no longer initial. Σαιστος (beside ψαιστον) and σανκρος beside ψαυκρος) are known from Hes. only; they are, if anything, peculiarities of some dia lect, as it is established in the case of σωχω (Ion.) for ψωχω. This exhausts the Greek mate rial. The change in question oceurs in some non-Greek words, such as ψιττακος and ψαγδας (Egyptian); among these, the island-names Σνρος-Σνριη : ψνρα, ψνριη (cf. kar. Συρνα, cret. Συρίν&amp;ος) and the name of the river Ψαρός : Σάρος in Cilicia (cf. the island Σάρος, near Karpathos) may have a bearing upon our subject. None of these instances can establish a law, or even a marked tendency, of Greek speech (cf. E. Schwyzer, Gr. Gram. 329). Museum Helveticum</page><page sequence="7">18 Günther Zuntz alternative form Ψαττφοι. Whatever the spelling, the name must hâve begun with some sibilant which did not "make position". In the manuscripts of Sappho's poems this sibilant is represented by Ψ. A Ψ which does not "make position" is not a psi. What then was this sibilant ? The sound which is normally represented by Greek sigma could not have given rise to the puzzling alternative spelling. One may next think of the problematical sibilant which is rendered by rr in Boeotian, Attic and Cretan, and elsewhere by σσ. In Greek however initial σσ-, whatever its origin (s+s, or a plosive, etc., followed by i), had been reduced to single s already in prehistoric times. It is rendered by σ (in Attic sometimes by τ-)32, never by psi. This fact squares with the other that ail attempts at a Greek etymology of the name Sappho have proved unavailing and that nearly ail bearers of the name hail from Asia Minor. In the native languages of Asia Minor there existed sibilants which defied représentation by means of the Greek alphabet. Recalling the result ing varieties of spelling e.g. of the "Lallname" Susu, Zuzu, Thuthu33 or the parallele Ασσος, Ασσα, Ασαι, Ασης and Σνεννεσις - Τυεννεσσος3*, we may consider our little problem in an Asianic context. In alphabetic scripts the Asianic sibilants most often appear as -σσ- (initial a-). In some cases this alternâtes with xei. The sign Ξ is the Semitic samekh. It cannot, for this reason, be supposed in these cases to represent a niere sibilant. The inscrip tion from Iasus35 on which the name Βρνασσις has several times been altered into -ξις dates from the 4th Century B.C. : the sign Ξ cannot, at this time, have re presented anything but the normal xei. A guttural element lies behind also the alternative Πιξωδαρος - Πισωδαρος36 and the few other similar instances37. The variants Σνριη - Ψυριη, Ψνρα and Σάρος - Ψαρο;38 quoted above p. 17 note 31 might suggest that similarly in the case of the name Sappho the sibilant was combined with a labial. Originally indicated by the letter psi, this labial element disappeared later and left the mere letter sigma to represent the initial. This assumption would square with the main inference suggested by the material so far presented, namely that the name Sappho belongs to the Asianic, rather than to the Greek sphere. There may indeed be reason to assume that there has been 32 The isolated spelling Σ Σ Α ΜΜΟ on an archaic tombstone at Akraiphia near Lake Copais (D. Korolkow, Ath. Mitt. 9 [1884] 15 = GDI 568a) may be ascribed to the out standing Boeotian tendency towards the doubling of sibilants and dentals. It sliould not be quoted in evidence of ψ- changing to σ-, for the dérivation of this name from ψαμμος is most improbable. More likely it may be connected with the name Σάμος in Pindar Ol. X 70. No proper names derived from ψαμμος are on record; no intermediateform *σάμμος exists between ψαμμος and άμμος·, the Nereid Ψαμα&amp;η is never *Σαμα&amp;η and, besides, ψαμα&amp;ος and ψαμμος are two différent things. 33 See A. M. Ramsay in JHS 24 (1904) 280. 34 A. Fick, Hattiden und Danubier (1908) 51. 35 BCH 5 (1881) 491; Dittenberger, Sylloge1 nr. 169. 36 P. Kretschmer, Einleitung (1896) 318. 37 See P.

However, in its application to the name Sappho, this assumption is contradicted by the previous observation that a letter which does not "make position" cannot be the double consonant psi. Even if we were to assume that the labial had origin ally preceded the initial s, it must be supposed to have disappeared before the time of the poetess. If then the labial was not spoken at the time, it is not likely to have been written either, for Sappho's was not an âge of "historical ortho graphy"39. The initial representing one single sibilant, there remains no argument for the assumption that it was ever combined with a labial. The sign in question stands for an un-Greek sound in a non-Greek name. The particular character of this sound may be more closely defined if it can be established why it is represented by psi in the Sappho manuscripts. It is higlily unlikely that Sappho herseif used the sign Ψ (\l/) for it. We must speakwith some reserve, for no archaic inscriptions fromLesbos are as yet known and the ancient Aeolic sherds from Naucratis40 withhold information on this point. If it is assumed that Sappho used an lonian aiphabet (which is the least probable as sumption), the sign Ψ, \!/, would have indicated the unsuitable double consonant. In the old island scripts the sign does not occur ; in all others it stands for k(h)41. There is then no reason to assume that Ψ could stand for a mere sibilant. But a sign which later on could be mistaken for psi was widely used, in various parts of ancient Asia Minor as well as elsewhere, to dénoté s. Sappho may have used this sign. In the early days of the alphabet, the Cyprian syllabary was not the only sur vivor of the previous, Aegean Systems of writing. Signs belonging to the pre alphabetic scripts were retained in nearly every part of the wide expanse through out which they had once been used, from the Pontus up to Spain42; just as the Icelanders and the Anglo-Saxons retained the rune p. Such survivais are most outstanding in Asia Minor43. We may recall the "cross pommé", for M1, on Milesian 39 The occurrence of both Ψνριη (γ 171) and Σνριη (ο 401) in Homer cannot demonstrate that ps- and s- could both habe been used in the name of one and the same person, for even though the two names may be linguistically identical, they dénoté différent islands in the Odyssey. 40 Ε.

The Greek sign &gt;|. for k, comes from the later Phoenician form &gt;), which occurs first on the Mesa stone and at Sendjirli. The adoption of this sign set the earlier form -v free and the Ionians now assigned it, quite arbitrarily, the value ps; in Melos and Thera it was used, just as arbitrarily, for ks (see H. Pedersen, Festskrift Ksbenhavn [1916] 33 and Ullman, Class. Ph. 22 [1927] 136). This sign, by the way, is fréquent in the early series of linear signs in Crete ; it occurs also in Melos and on bronze age wäre from Cyprus (S. Casson, Ancient Cyprus [1937] 100, nr. 15); it is, finally, identical with one of the hieratic forms of the Egyptian hieroglyph k (also transcribed h), which may be the source of all those quoted. Consequently, the ancient Cretan sign may likewise dénoté k, or a syllable beginning with k. In the présent context, the main fact is that Sappho is most unlikely to liave used the sign ν for her initial, for with her it could hardly have represented anything but k(h). 42 A. H.

The Asianic s was widely rendered by a variety of signs47 (lu, ψ, fil, Iii, etc.) which can be reduced to a basic form consisting of three vertical lines connected, or crossed, by a horizontal. The numéral sampi m = 900 in its varying forms dérivés from it48. These signs may originally have denoted différent syllables beginning with s, but within the Greek, or graecising, alphabets they are often used interchangeably, and this in Greek as well as in Asianic words. ψ is recorded from Pamphylia (coins and inscription), ψ from Halicarnassus, Teus, Ephesus49, Φ, ΤΠ, LU occur on coins of Mesambria, ffi also in Cyzicus, and |-U on a Cyprian bilinguis50 ( Τ IMΟΔΟΡΟ\^). These signs correspond with Greek σσ, and sometimes σ, in such Greek words as ανασσα or ϋαλαασα as well as in Asianic ones, e.g. in Αλικαρνασσός or Παννασσις. The sound rendered may therefore well be compared with that of Semitic sadë, but the attemptä of Gardthausen and Lidzbarski51 to derive the actual signs from this Semitic letter have estahlished the impossibility of this dérivation. The true provenience of this set of signs is indicated by their occurrence throughout the sphere of the ancient "Aegean" script, from Karia52, Cyprus83, Crete54 and Troy55 to Italy86, Spain57 and North Africa58. These then are ancient "Aegean" signs serving to render an Asianic sound. Sappho can he supposed to have used one of them for her initial. 44 A. J. Evans, Scripta Minoa 98; J.

The objection is hardly décisive that this particular variety has so far been found only in the South of Asia Minor, seeing that not far from Lesbos, at Mesambria, several similar varieties were in use simultaneously and that an isolated ψ occurs on a potsherd from Naucratis59. If in view of the prépondérance of φ in Ionia this sign is regarded as more likely to have been used in Lesbos, it may be remembered that it was used for psi on Selinuntian coins60. That the poetess in spelling her name used a sign outside the later standard alphabet is by no means an improbable assumption. The Cyprian Timodoros did the samewith less justification, and Sappho also used the digamma. Ψαπφω then is ψαπφω (pronounce Sap-pho). The signs Γ and ψ both survived in the manu scripts of her poems61 and were retained by the Alexandrian scholars in the éditions from which the later texts derive62; they retained in the same way the équivalent sign Iii (cf. above) which they found in the manuscripts of Hippocratese2a . In subséquent copies the unwonted signs gave way to similar, but unsuited, forms. F became Τ, Γ, E\ Lü became Ψ. Thus the cognate sign φ used by Alcaeus63 and Herodotus64 appears to have occasioned the corrupt readings κυπ αττιδες and Ολιατος65. The spelling Ψαπφω on some coins from Eresos, of the 59 W. M.

Sprachf. 46 [1914] 296) endeavoured to show that the Alexandrian editors relied upon fourth Century manuscripts of the Lesbian poets is flimsy; see E. Lobel, Σαπφούς μέλη, p. XIX. Even if Κ. had been right, the "abnormal" signs could be supposed to have survived; as the parallel from Hippocrates (below note 62a) shows. 62 Possibly the editors of Alcaeus rendered it- by no. All manuscripts of Hephaestion 85 (p. 45 Consb.) have μελλιχομειδες Σαπφοι. The additional a (which is deleted in the best ms. A) may indeed be meant to introduce a less unusual form of the adjective—or could it belong to the initial of Σαπφοι ? e2i' See Ε. Wenkebach in Berl. Ak. Sbb. 1920, 241 ff. Publishing and discussing a most inter esting passage of Galen on the subject (I owe this reference to the article of K. Latte quoted in note 65). The "Karian" sign had become unintelligible in Hellenistic times; Galenus reports the ensuing discussion on its meaning.

Here again a ψ in the original may later on have been mistaken for a tav and thus have occasioned the corruption. Professor Latte indeed, with what seems to me an excess of scepticism, would discard the two instances quoted in the text. He recalls that Wilamowitz, under the fresh impression of the spelling Φιττακος in the Alcaeus papyrus Ox. 1234, abandoned his earlier suggestion and considered the spelling κυπαττιδες to be likewise explicable as the render ing of a foreign word. However the situation is not the same. The name of the Thracian Pittacus always retains its double dental (one could not imagine a ΦισσακοςΙ), while κυπασσις is thus spelled wherever it occurs, even by the Ionians Hecataeus and Hipponax and the Attic Aristophanes and Lysias. It seems to me entirely incredible that the Lesbians, to whom rr is foreign, should have introduced it where the sibilant was thus marked; nor</page><page sequence="11">22 Günther Zuntz âge of the Antonines, may be ascribed to the enthusiasm of local antiquarians fired by the corrupted spelling in manuscripts then current. Pap. Οχ. 1787 is such a manuscript. As to the Goluchow vase, the uneducated person who strove to add to the attractions of the picture of a harpist by inscribing it with the name of the poetess : this person can be supposed to hâve substituted the Dorian Ψάφω for the non-Greek Sapplto. He may have been a Dorian himself66. But the Alexan drian editors knew the correct form. Under the text in which they had retained the archaic spelling, thev wrote the title Σαπγονς μελη. Σαπφούς, not Ψαπφονς. IV. The root sap The name Sappho is "Asianic" : this conclusion is imposed by three independent observations. Most of the bearers of this name are, not Greek, but Asianic; the name itself is incapable of a Greek etymology; and its initial is of an un-Greek quality. In other words, we would assign this name to the pre-Indoeuropean Stratum which has contributed so many names and words to the Greek vocabulary. In Lesbos, a name of this kind is anything but out of place. The names of the island itself (Lazpas in Hittite), its mountains (e.g. Lepetymnos, Ordymnos, Olympos) and towns (Arisba, Eresos, Methymna, Mytilene) are of this type. One of the most outstanding among Sappho's contemporaries, Myrtilos, bears the name of a famous Hittite king, a name too that is fréquent all over Asia Minor, and Sappho's friend Atthis likewise bears an "Asianic" name67. One may infer that her family, though of the highest rank, did not descend from the invading Penthilidae but from the ancient stock of the islanders68, and might proceed to relate some of her characteristics, in body and mind, to this non-Greek ancestry. Such inferences however are better kept private, for they are incapable of proof. can the change be ascribed to Attic orthography. Wilamowitz' earlier suggestion then has not lost its basis. With regard to Ολιατος in Herodotus V 37, 1 Latte dismisses the parallel Ολιασας on a late inscription from Cyprus (JAOS 11, Proceed. 167, 170) and follows A. Rehm who had defended the manuscript reading by reference to the name Λιατος occurring on an inscription from Miletus (Ergebnisse der Ausgrabungen I 3 (1914) 254 and 258; inscr. 122,1 2 and 106). Here again I am not sure that the more recent view is necessari ly correct; at best, the scales to me seem to be evenly balanced. If the Milesian analogy is noteworthy, the Cyprian remains striking. It certainly is not invalidated by the observa tion that the occurrence of a Karian name on Cyprus is improbable. If the Herodotean Ολιαφος of Mylasa was a Karian, why should not a namesake of his, many centuries later, have lived on Cyprus (cp. the Christian Τιρρηνος in Lycaonia referred to below p. 23 note 74) ? The latter Ολιασα- is indeed quite likely to have been a Karian, for his dedication is to Zeus Labraundos. However this assumption is not necessary for the argument. There was a Karian ealled Sappho—yet the name is found outside Karia. 66 Mr. J. A. Davison suggests to me the alternative possibility that the person who ordered the vase may have supplied the painter with the name in the Aeolic spelling and that the painter misinterpreted the initial. My main point is that the evidence against the Dorian affinity of the name is too overwhelming to be invalidated by the vase-inscription. 67 The Greeks wavered as to the spelling of names related to the pre-Greek, Asianic Αττις: Α&amp;ηνη, Ατηνη, Ατανασσος, Ατϋ-ις, Αττις, Αττική. It may be that, at least in later times, the name Ατ&amp;ις could indicate that its bearer hailed from Attica. In the case of Sappho's friend this assumption would be against all historical probability. 68 The non-Greek element in the name of Sappho's father Skamandros or Skamandro nymos (cf. A. M. Ramsay, JHS 24 [1904] 286), gives slight support to this assumption, for it may have been suggested by the Iliad.</page><page sequence="12">On the Etvmoloav of the Name Sappho 23 Linguistically this name raises problems which deserve considération. Σαπψω Σαπφα recalls Asianic "Lallnamen" like Ναννω-Ναννα, Βαβω-Βαβα, Anna, Απφια, Νοννω, etc. Notwithstanding this similarity, the name Sappho is not a "Lall name". Its root is of a différent kind and is never found doubled. We may find this root in the name of the small island Sapyle near Amorgos69, in the place-name Sapethos (or Sapethon) on Tenos70 and perhaps in the name "old as Inachos" of the mountain Sapvselaton in Argolis71. In Asia Minor I find no other dérivations from this root72—unless it is supposed that here, as so often, the tenuis (b) may be considered équivalent to the media (φ). If this is accepted, Sundwall73 will supply a fair number of instances. These associations by no means exhaust the interest of our root. On venturing farther afield, suggestive possibilities and the chances of error increase apace. It is worth risking the latter in order to appraise the former. In view of the established "Kleinasiatisch-etruskische Namengleichungen" it seems natural from Asia Minor first to glance at the Etruscans74. The root sap is fréquent with them. CIE 2713 vel sapu au. I. i.e. "Vel Sapu, son of Aule Latinus" was compared, by K. Pauli75, with CIL X 5257 Sex Latini. /... Ter. Sabo. Another Sabo is on CIE 4840. I refrain from reproducing the whole relevant material as presented by W. Schulze76. Etruscan sapusa, sapnal, sapinias and Latin Sappinius (with Sabinius, Sabidius, Sabius) are in this group. Are these names identical (as Herbig thought)77 with Lydo Phrygian Σαβνς and Pisidian Σαβίνα.''8 ? Is there, in particular, a relation between the name of the Umbrian tribus Sappinia79 and Asianic Sapu (on which more below), similar to that between the Roman gens Tarquinia and the Asianic god Tarkul I hesitate to go beyond these questions. They involve the further problem how far, in these instances, the similarity of b and p, both in Etruscan and in the Asianic languages, affects the issue. This in turn raises the question of the Indo European character of the name of the Italian Sabini. I learn from J. Whatmough80 69 Plin. Ν.H.

Alessio has discussed "una nuova base mediterranea *Sap-, *Sab-"sl. My efforts to secure this article having failed, I must leave this part of the inquiry to otbers. The Etruscan instances quoted seem at least sufficient, together with the Asianic material, to establish the "mediterranean" character of the root sap-. In testing the Celtic and Illyrian evidence we are on even more uncertain ground. The possibility of accidentai homophony increases; moreover this field of study is at présent in a state of révolution, or revaluation, which imposes reserve. We have obviously got to exclude dérivations from the ( ? Germanie) root sapo = "soap", and also the names Sapo, Saponius, Saponianus which Holder82 strangely enough related to it : they are actually Punie, as the provenience of the inscriptions in question shows, and will concern us presently. This still leaves a number of instances which, with every reserve, may be worth mentioning in the présent context. Such are, first, the fréquent Celtic name Sa(p)piusm ( ? also Sabius) with Sappulus and similar derivatives. The name of the river Sapis (Sabis in one ms.) near Ravenna84 is not easily separated from that of the Sabini—at least the Sabini in the Val Sabbia West of Lake Garda; this, if relevant, would bring in the river Sabis (Sambre) and the Celtic name Sabinas with its relatives85 as well as the Ligurian Sabatia vada86 and Illyrian Sabulus, Sabylinthos87 and Sapua. It may perhaps seem gratuitous to quote names from places so distant, whose similarity may indeed be purely accidentai. However the proto-Indoeuropean theory, which Professor P. Kretschmer has lately pre sented in a revised form and with overwhelming learning88, would make it possible to ascribe them all to a common linguistic Stratum. North Africa supplies unambiguous evidence. Among a sériés of Punie names we read, on CIL VIII 68, Muthunbaal Saphonis films. Justin89 mentions Sapho son of Asdrubal. This is literally the same name as = Sapo on CIS I 788 (likewise from Carthage). Ib. 1379 the same name is written with final aleph90. The latinised form Sapo and its dérivâtes Saponius, Saponianus, Saposus, Sapidus are fairly fréquent on later Roman inscriptions91. Sapo is the hvpocoristic abbrevia 81 L'Italia Antichissima, Ν.

It is often used also as a woman's name; so is the "Koseform" Sophoniba93. It follows that the other "Koseform", Sap(ph)o, could likewise be used as a woman's name94. Other names containing the same element and likewise attested on Punie in scriptions are Adoni-sapon, Baal-sapon, Abd-sapon, Bod-sapon, etc.95. These Punie names are easily traced to the Phœnician mother-country. One of the many Phœnician scribbles m Sethi's temple in Abydos96 préserves the name Bodsapon; it may or may not be identical with the one read as Bodsapol bv Lidzbarski97. These inscriptions are ascribed to the 5th to 3rd Century B.C. Saponbaal and Adonisapon mean "Sapon is (my) Lord" and Abdsapon, "Servant of Sapon". Sapon then was a god. For more than two thousand years this god had been ail but forgotten. Gesenius and Movers indeed had guessed at his ex istence; now the excavations at Bas Shamra have brought him to light again. Spn = Sapön, the Baal Zephon of the Ohl Testament, was one of the most out standing gods of Ugarit. I suppress my collection and discussion of the relevant evidence. The reader will find it all in the füll and compétent work of R. de Langhe98. The interprétation of the Ugaritic texts is still far from settled. For the présent purpose the following established facts suffice. Throughout the Old Testament the word spn dénotés the North. Sapôn, according to the Ras Shamra texts, was the god of Md. Kasios north of Ugarit. This mountain was a place of worship, from the oldest times onward, throughout antiquity (Zeus Kasios) and indeed to this day. Apollodorus and Nonnus preserve an Asianic myth localised there: the story of the fight be tween the sky-god and the monster which the Greeks called Typhon99. S a ρ ο- S a ρ h ο Κ a ρ ρ h ο is the name, originally, of a worshipper—maie or female— of the god Sapôn. The variants in the spelling of the labial are irrelevant: "ganz adäquat waren weder π noch ψ einem semitischen Labial"100. In Latin renderings of the Punie name we have found Sapo and Sapho. Semitic £ corresponds with πψ e.g. in Σαπφειρα, Σαπφα (i.e. Safa East of Damascus) ; cf. the variants Σαπα ρα-Σαπφαρα, Σαπειρψη - Σαπφειρηνη. The very "Baal Zephon" Exod. XIV 2, 8 is, in the Septuagint, Βε(ε)λ Σεπφων according to cod. Β and its allies, but 92 e.g. CIS I 207. 371. 415. 93 M. Lidzbarski, Ephemeris 1 (1901) 25 and 308. 94 There may have been a female Sappho on CIL VIII 10649. 95 Other names containing the same element are quoted by de Langhe (see below note 98) 222.—It seems useless to suggest for Saponbaal an alternative etymology (so Eissfeldt p. 11), which eould not apply to the cognate Bodsapon, Adonisapon, Baalsapon etc. and would make the shortened form Sapho loose the essential element of the füll form. 96 CIS I 308 97 M.

It may likewise represent the doubled labial, for the Semitic alphabet, as little as most early Greek inscriptions, does not express the doubling of consonants (cf. Greek καππα for Γ j). The name Σαπφω-Σαφφω then may alternatively be taken to indicate a double consonant in the name of the god spn. Finally—and this seems to me the most probable assumption—the doubled labial may be due to the hypocoristic abbreviation of a füll name, for this would correspond with a tendency as marked in the Semitic languages as it is in Greek101. On any count, the Lesbian and the Semitic names are identical. It surely is anything but seif evident that this identity must be due to mere chance. In considering the opposite possibility, we do not propose to présent Sappho of Lesbos as a Semite. Not even this view, indeed, would be quite novel; but it could not account for the facts. Even apart from linguistics, Semitic influence appears to be wanting, in archaic times, both in the inferior of Asia Minor and on its coast North of Smyrna102. Pace Y. Bérard there was, in 7th Century Lesbos, no tradition, no monument, no affinity that could have induced aristocratie parents there to give their child a Semitic name. The foregoing survey of the evidence for the name Sappho and related forms suggests that we account for the actual similarity of the Lesbian and the Punie names by a différent assumption. I submit that the name of the god of Ugarit is not Semitic. His abode is on Mt. Kasios. A. Goetze103 and R. de Langhe104 have shown that the latter occurs in Hittite documents in the form Hazi (or Hazzis). It is an Asianic name1C5. We find, in and around Asia Minor, the island Κασος, with the Κασιων νήσοι106, between Karpathos and (Jrete; the places Κασος m (Jrete1"', Κασα near Hahcarnassus, Κασαρεα, Κασωσσος, Κασωλαβα in Karia and Κασαι in Cilicia108 ; and many per sonal names such as Κάσιος, Κασια, Κασησος109. This mountain with the persistent Asianic name, situated in a région where all old place-names are non-Semitic and Asianic (Tyros for instance)110, is the place, as mentioned above, of an ancient Asianic myth. Together with the god whose abode it is, this mountain is found to have been called Çapôn, or Baal-$apön, by the Semites. Yarious Semitic etymologies for this name have by turns been 101 Lidzbarski, Ephemeris 1, 294 and 307; 2, 11; M. Noth, Die israel. Personnennamen, (1928) 39. 102 These contentions of F.

Eiss feldt, after Bauer-Leander, suggested112, seems to be widely favoured113. This dérivation undoubtedly suits the place and is, as far as I can judge, linguistically possible. However, it fails to account for the fact that this word, which is so fré quent in the Old Testament, occurs only in the Hebrew, Phœnician and Aramaic but is not used by the other Semites. Moreover I submit, with due respect, that material considérations render this dérivation inacceptable. If a mountain has once been given the straightforward name "Look-out", it may indeed still be the abode of a god who in conséquence might be called "Lord of the Look-out" i.e. Baal §apôn. But the assumption that the god could have simply been called "Look-out", synonymous with this plain name of his mountain, seems to me in credible. If then the attempt at a Semitic etymology of the name Çapôn is abandoned, the way is free for the suggestion that it is, like Kasios, an Asianic name and re lated to some or ail of the instances which we have collected. And indeed it is an Asianic, and not a Semitic habit to regard a mountain itself as a god. From the Hittite is quoted, beside Hazzis-Kasios, the god and mountain Nannis114: it recalls the countless Asianic names like Nanna, Nanno, etc. Olympos too is men tioned115 as the husband of Kybele and is depicted as a god on coins of the âge of Trajan and Commodus116. In posing the Asianic origin of the god Sapôn we only add one instance to a number of similar, recognised facts. It is enough to recall the analogous history of the gods Tesup, Atargatis and Kubaba-Cybebe-Cybele. In général, this theory fits into the teaching of Eduard Meyer as formulated in his last work117: "die Be völkerung und Religion ist im ganzen nördlichen und mittleren Syrien ursprüng lich kleinasiatisch ; die semitischen Eindringlinge haben sich erst seit dem 15. Jahr hundert ... darüber gelagert und dabei die älteren Kulte übernommen, wenn 111 In accordance with his theory of the Southern origin of the Phœnicians, R. Dussaud {Les religions des Hittites, in "Mana" 2 [1945] 357) supposes "Saphon" to be "le dieu du nord". This view would be less hard to accept if "El-sapön" or "Baal-sapön" were the primi tive form. The Ras Shamra documents however show that the mere Sapon is original. Can any people really be assumed to have worshipped a god whom they renamed "North" because they themselves had been earlier living South of his domain—at a time when they did not yet know of him ? Anyhow this theory does not explain how the word spn originated and how it came to denote "North".—R. Dussaud (whose authority I venture to contra dict only with the greatest respect and hésitation) regards the god Sapön as identical with the North Syrian Hadad. We shall submit in Appendix A the reasons for our qualified agree ment with this identification. 112 Baal Zaphon p. 17. 113 Doubts were expressed by de Langhe loc. laud.

Nabü is not a mountain-god. 117 Geschichte des Altertums II 2 (1931) 165.</page><page sequence="17">28 Günther Zuntz auch zum Teil unter semitischen Namen". Ugarit in particular housed many in habitants of Asianic descent118. The termination of the name Sapön has many parallele in the same région ; one may compare Sanchun, Esmun, Eliun, etc.119. On Asianic ground120 the root sap is likely to have been expanded by a dark vowel only. We thus arrive at a hypo thetical form §apu. The analogy with Tarhu-Tarchön is striking. Adon(is), on the view advocated in Appendix B, is in the same Company. On this basis it becomes possible to ascribe a common origin to all the wide-spread occurrences of the name Sappho. These very tentative suggestions must not obscure the primary linguistic pur pose of the présent essay. Those who accept Professor Kretschmer's "proto-Indo european" theory may find it possible to consider the whole of the material here presented as issuing from one common root. Those who hesitate to accept this bold view may ascribe the Celtic, Ligurian, Illyrian and perhaps also the Semitic analogies to mere chance. I shall be content if those qualified to judge accept the modest main thesis: Sappho is an Asianic name. Appendix A: Sapön and Typhon (cf. above pp. 25ff.) Having derived the name Sappbo from an Asianic root sap-, one is tempted to guess at the implications of this root. The fréquent change between tenuis and media in Asia Minor might be taken to support its connection with the name of the Phrygian god Sabos-Sabazios. This connection however cannot be maintained, for the labial in Sabazios, as P. Kretschmer has shown121, is really w, from which πφ could not be derived. Moreover this god is of the Indo-european inheritance of the Phrygians (and Thracians), while the name Sappho is attested also as Karian. This dérivation rejected leaves room for the reference, suggested above, to the god Çapôn of Ras Shamra. We remain within the framework of the présent article in briefly considering his identity. Gesenius and Movers have had followers in identifying Çapôn and Greek Typhon122. The équation of a supposedly Semitic sadë and Greek τ recurs in one or two other instances which are at présent widely believed, namely in Tyrus = Sur and τνραννος = seren (the Old Testament word for the "lords" of the Phi listines)123. This linguistic feature mavindeed be found within the Asianic langua ges. The place-name Τνεννεσσος is likely to présent the same root as the personal 118 See de Langhe loc. laud. II 251 ff. 119 Lidzbarski, Ephemeris 3, 260; Z. S. Harris, Phoen. Gramm. 58 (-un is the more reeent form of the ending -ön). 120 In the Asianie field the name can, but need not, have been a "Kurzform". The use of a divine name for human beings is one more distinctive Asianie characteristic (e.g. Attis, Olympos, Adon, Ma; cf. Sundwall p. 275). Behind this use there lies a notion of "union with the god" which reappears in the Hellenistic mystery religions. 121 Einleitung (1896) 195. 122 Cp. O. Eissfeldt, Baal Zafhon (1932) 23 n. 4 (Eissfeldt himself is sceptical about the identification). 123 See R. A. S.

If the Philistine word seren is related to τύραννος, it would be on the same Asianic basis. The équivalence however of a Semitic sadë and Greek τ is nowhere attested. The nearest approach to it—but by no means a true instance—is the Septuagint rendering, in cod. B, of the very word sadë in Lam. I 18, etc. by τιαΔη (σαόη the others). A mere τ has not so far been shown to correspond with the Semitic letter. Τύρος for Sur proves nothing. I shall not here enlarge on what I have said elsewhere126. Tyros is a widespread Asianic place-name meaning "strong place"; the (unrelated) Semitic sur has been substituted for the primitive, Asianic name of the city. Notwithstanding the lack of parallele, the équation Sapön = Typhon might seem of late to have been almost mathematically proved. Typhon was identified with the Egyptian Set perhaps as early as the 6th Century127. An Egyptian de dication at Ras Shamra is inscribed—or is said to be inscribed—to Set of Sapuna128. If history were a branch of mathematics, the équation §apön = Typhon would be established. However the Euclidean axioms are not valid in this context: différent gods could be identified with one and the same third. The différence between Typhon and the god of Ras Shamra amounts to absolute opposition. We here enter a field of most intricate and unsettled inquiry. We do so with every deference to the experts whose domain it is. At best we may hope that the suggestions of an outsider may introduce some viewpoints which further research may utilise. I want to substantiate the thesis that Sapön, being the pre-Semitic god of Mt. Kasios, is a form of the Anatolian sky-god whose particular myth is preserved—but not in the texts from Ugarit. Some of my arguments have been adduced before by others; maybe that in a fresh présentation they will yield a plausible result. The god of the sky and the thunder présents one of the riddles of Near-Eastern mythology in so far as he appears to be primitive both in Asia Minor and farther to the East. The Sumerian Iskur, the Accadian Adad, the Aramaic Hadad, the Hurrite Tesup and the numberless individualisations of the Anatolian "weather god" indeed show certain différences in accordance with the régions where they were venerated. In Mesopotamia, for example, this god appears preeminently as the dispenser of rain and inundations and hence of destruction as well as of opu lence, while his Hittite counterpart holds the supreme place at least among all male gods. Yet the strikingly similar pictorial représentations of all of them, and in particular their common connection with the bull, suggest a similar basic con ception whose origin is not easily traced. The particular character, within this 124 See above p. 18. 125 A. Fick, Hattiden 44 126 Classica et Mediaev. 8 (1947) 216. 127 Namely by Pherecydes—if Origen c. Gels.

Kasios may be discerned, if we consider the unique features of his abode and the myth which centers upon it. Mt. Kasios is as outstanding a place in mythology as it is geographically. This landmark of North Syria; this natural pharus for Mediterranean navigation—was as fit to become a seat of the gods as was Thessali an Olympus. And such it was; but not for long. The tables of Ugarit have revealed, in the almost blinding light of unexpected discovery, the sight of a Semitic panthéon; of gods living, loving, fighting and dying; a spectacle of garish and barbarous vitality, emerging and fading like the vision of a passionate dream. The gods of Ugarit were not the first dwellers on this haunted spot; "there was a tims when they were not", and there was a time when they were no more. When they had quitted, Mt. Kasios became again what it had been before their appearance : the scene of a cosmic drama ; the battle-ground for the god of the sky and the monster of the abyss. I submit that Sapôn is the hero of this battle. Is it not remarkable that in the poems, in which his name appears so frequently, Çapôn is not a person ; that no myth tells of him; that he has faded into a geographical term? And yet the Phœnician names of persons which we have quoted as well as documents from Ugarit and from outside prove him to have been an outstanding deity. This implicit contradiction lends probability to the guess that Sapôn was the previous owner of the spot which the Semitic gods of Ugarit invaded and held for an aeon and no longer. The battle between god and monster is a common memory of mankind, but it assumes différent forms with différent families of nations. The traditions of the sun god combating Apophis and of Marduk killing Tiamat are sufficiently well known and characteristic to distinguish the Egyptian and the Babylonian tra ditions from the North- Syrian. The latter is characterised, first, by a natural stage which brings out uniquely the idea of the cosmic contest. From the top of Kasios the view embraces, across the bay of Issos, the bleak uplands of Cilicia Trachea. The barren ground there holds one of the wonders of the earth: the cauldron-like chasm called the Corycian cave129. This was the den of the monster which threatened to overthrow the sky-god. The saga of the fight of these two cosmic powers reaches back to hoar antiquity. Two Hittite versions130 develop the primitive form and conflate it with anthropomorphic and Babylonian elements. The Greeks adopted it as early as the 9th or 8th century, or even earlier131. It was 129 There are in fact several of these pits; see Pomponius Mêla I 72; J. G. Frazer, Adonis, Attis, Osiris I (1914) 152. I venture to simplify the facts in the same way as ancient mytho logy did. · 130 Namely the Kumarbi-myth (which I only know from H. G. Giiterbock's article in AJA 52 [1948] 125ff.) and the Illujankas-stories (below note 143). 131 I am thinking of the "Dananians" ( ? Δαναοή, who have recently reappeared at Kara tepe; see R. T. O'Callaghan in Orientalia 18 (1949) 193. I have some doubts whether the Phcenicians could have been the mediators (as Güterbock, I.e. 133, suggests), because—so far, at least—this myth does not appear among the Ugaritic epics. Whether or no the Phoenicians adopted it into their basically différent mythology, the story is certain to have been told at Ugarit as well as in Cilicia and Greek traders or settlers could hear it at either place.</page><page sequence="20">On the Etymology of the Name Sappho 31 an outstanding theme of Near-Eastern religion. It survived the invasion of Mt. Ka sios by the Semitic gods and continued to appeal to religious and poetical imagina tion down to the very end of antiquity. The monster was the offspring of the Earth, begotten by her in wrath against her husband, the sky-god. With the Greeks they are Zeus or Kronos132, Hera133 or Gaia134, and Typhon (Typhoeus, Typhos)135 or Ophioneus; in the Hittite tra dition the monster is called Illujankas or Ullicummi. The thunder of their battle is echoed in some verses of the Iliad and in Pindar186 and by the fulier narrative, however clumsy, which is interpolated in Hesiod's Theogony137; it is commemo rated also on "Hittite" reliefs138 and Greek vases139. The older Greek tradition, if we may judge from what survives140, had adopted and reshaped only the most essential features of the Eastern myth. Details of a primitive and barbarous character emsrge, in the latest period of antiquity, in Normo s ' Dionysiaca141 and the so-called Library of Apollodorus142 ; their agreement with the Illu yankas myth on Hittite tablets143 is proof of the original character of these late 132 Pherecydes B4 Diels (above p. 29 note 127). 133 Horn.

Materially this distinction is obviously correct—the monster is in no way connected with the winds—but it can hardly serve to sett-le the vexed question of its etymology, for already Pindar and the oldest mytho graphers fail to observe the distinction. 136 Iliad Β 781 ff.; Pindar fragm. 93. 137 Theog. 820ff. 138 The relief at Malatia, A.

The hellenistic character stands out in the figure of Aegipan and in the pedantic curi osity with which odd pièces of folklore are traced and reported; e.g. the wrapping-up of Zeus' sinews in a bear-skin. Pindar fragm. 93 appears to présupposé an older epic of similar content which related the change of the fleeing Olympians into animais, thus accounting for the animal shapes of the Egyptian gods. Pindar Pyth. I and Ol. IV 7 and Aesch. Prom. 351 reflect a Sicilian version, that is an epic of the 8th or 7th Century. The primitive form, centered on Cilicia and Mt. Kasios, lies beyond these rewritings, most of which contain allusions to it. Its very early origin is stressed by Hera and Gaia alternately taking the place of the Asianic earth goddess and by the two différent names given to both the sky god and the monster. 143 Translated in A.

The sky-god was conquered in the first battle; he lost parts of 1ns body145 ; tbe monster dragged him into its den ; whence with the help of a mortal man (Inaras in Hittite, Kadmos in Greek) he is freed for tbe last, victorious combat. Such, in its basic outline, is the myth of Mt. Kasios. Its absence from tbe Ugarit cycle of poems suggests that it is tbe tradition of a différent people; this suggestion squares with tbe view (for wbich we bave given our reasons)146 that tbe word sapôn is not Semitic. Further finds may indeed still give us tbe Semitic version of tbis myth, but already we know enougb of tbe Semitic panthéon of Ugarit to say that tbe god .Sapôn has no place in it. In the poems, Çapôn or Baal Sapôn is tbe mountain on wbich e.g. Baal aspires to build his palace. Not even the great authority of R. Dussaud147 can persuade me that this Baal is himself the ancient sky-god ; he certainly is not §apôn. Dussaud himself has outlined, on the basis of his unique command of the facts, the particular character of the god Baal of Ras Shamra148: his fights, death and résurrection are symbolic of the change of seasons and of Phœnician nature in général. If thereafter we were to pose the identity of sky-god and nature-god (of Tesup as it were and Adonis), all individuality of the gods would be negated149. It is true that in the Phœnician version of the Karatepe inscription Baal stands for the Anatolian weather-god150. The word baal is in itself sufficiently indefinite to fit the most diverse gods ; it fits the god of Adana in so far as he is the "lord" of the sky, and indeed we find the füll form baal samêrn at the end of the inscription151. The Baal of the Ras Shamra poems is différent. He is found, so Ch. Virrolleaud informe us, in constant fight with Yäm, the god of the sea152. This myth may or may not be related to the one we have outlined, but it is not the same. Typhon Illuyankas is not a god of the sea, even though the monster did cross the sea to attack Mt. Kasios. The "fleeing serpent, the strong one with seven heads" called Un ( ? Leviathan) in RS I AB I 26ff.153 may have played this part in a Semitic version, otherwise as yet unknown, of the Sapôn myth. 144 Cf. W. Porzig, Kleinasiatische Forschungen I (1930) 379.—Barlier echos of these particular traditions may lurk in the fragmentary passage on Epimenides (68 Β 8 Diels) in Philodemus De pietate 61b and in Strabo 750-1. 145 The first part of the Kumarbi-myth (Güterbock's "Theogony") has at last made clear what was originally meant by that stränge feature in Nonnus and Apollodorus (anti cipated in the Illujankas-myth) : Zeus is said to have lost his "sinews" or his "heart". These are euphemisms, probably no longer understood, for emasculation ; see Güterbock I.e. 124. 146 Cf. above p. 26f. 147 Les religions des Hittites (1945) 357. 362; Rev. Hist.

Kasios is rightly likened to the North Syrian Hadad154. The god Baal of the Ras Shamra poems may have taken over some of his functions ; one day, perhaps, we may find in them a myth comparable to the one which in pre-semitic days centered on this spot. However, the whole character and temper of the poems is différent from this myth and its chief actor has faded into a geographica! term. Yet this myth lived on, in Greek disguise, throughout Grseco-Roman antiquity. "Jupiter Dolichenus" retains the features of the ancient sky-god with thunder bolt and double-axe; the story which we have found in late Greek sources may have been his cult-legend. The god Sapôn, though absent from the Ras Shamra poems, was revered at Ugarit and beyond. His name occurs four times in the Ugaritic lists of gods to whom sacrifice is due ; in three further instances a Semitic title, twice "baal" and once "ël", is prefixed to it155. In the 14th Century the Egyp tian Mami dedicated to him, at Ugarit, the stele to which we have referred156. He appears to have inscribed it to Set-Sapon157. If this is the correct translation, Mami used the identification, which under the New Empire had become traditional, of the Egyptian Set and the Syrian sky-god158. This Set then is not Typhon, but his victorious Opponent. Six hundred years later Baal Sapunu is invoked as a guarantor of the treaty between Asarhaddon and Tyre159; in subséquent centuries, the theophoric names of Phœnicians in Egypt and North Africa160 keep his memory alive161. In Greek disguise, $apôn became Ζευς Κάσιος. This form of his name supplies the answer to the question why one and the same Syrian mountain could be called by two différent, Asianic names. On the Yazilikaya relief the sky-god (whose Asianic name is still unknown) stands on the heads of two subordinate gods. They are the mountains Nannis and Hazzis162. The latter is the Κασιον δρος. Ζευς Κάσιος then is the sky-god Çapôn on the mountain(-god) Kasios. The Semites called the mountain by the name of the god whose abode it was; with them, the "Lord Sapôn", Baal Sapôn, became the "Lord of (the mountain) §apôn"163. When the god reasserted his ancient rights, the mountain regained its original name. 154 The identification was proposed, in 1932, by R. Dussaud (Rev. Hist. Rel. 105, 256). 155 The evidence in De Langhe loc. laud. II 223. 156 The building in which it was found is with good reason supposed to have been the temple of Sapön or Baal Sapôn. But this baal, I submit, is not the god Baal of the poems. 157 See Syria 12 (1936) pl. VI; De Langhe I 90; II 223; C. F. A. Schaeffer, Ugaritica (1939) 40. I cannot say whether Eissfeldt's translation (1.1. p. 2) "Baal Zaphon" should be preferred. The original translation (retained by De Langhe) "Set of Sapuna" certainly needed correction, since Sapuna has long since been known not to have been the name of the city. 158 J. Vandrier, La religion égyptienne (1944) 139. 159 The literature apud De Langhe II 219. 160 See above p. 24. 161 Direct evidence of the cult of Sapön may be contained in the often quoted sacrificial tariff of Marseille; see the literature apud De Langhe II 221. 162 J.

This one has no inscription. It represents, in a slightly egyptian sing style, the typical Asianic sky-god with the thunderbolt and the horns of the bull. A waving line under his feet indicates the mountain from which he rules; a second, thinner one below may symbolise the sea from which rose the monster which he defeated. Appendix Β : On Adonis As a parallel to the preceding suggestion about Sapôu, I venture to submit a similar one concerning Adonis. The material concerning the latter has often been presented and discussed ; I shall therefore be very brief. The evidence upon which I am relying can all be found in Baudissin's work165. My suggestion is twofold: (1) Adon is the name of the god of Byblus and not a mere title ; and (2) this name is not Semitic but Asianic. Ad (1): in marked différence from the Semitic baal, the word adon is never connected with a genitive noun so as to effect the meaning "lord of ..." ; nor does a verb of this root exist166. Both these facts intimate that adön is not originally a plain noun. The extremely fréquent Phœnician name Adonibaal is most naturally translated "Adön is lord"167: this alone suggests that Adön is a divine name. The same inference is suggested by the Phœnician seal with the inscription "Adön has saved" as well as by the Assyrian cylinders inscribed with Phœnician names such as "Adön is my rock", "Adön gives a son", etc. If this suggestion is accepted, it is no longer necessary to regard as a mason's slip168 the inscription from Constan tine "To the lord, the baal Adön". Why then should we hesitate to accept the view which was held throughout antiquity, namely that Adön was the name of the god of Byblus? The transition by which this name became, among people who did not worship this god, an ordinary noun meaning "lord" is in itself natural. It has a parallel in the use, by the Accadians, of the name of the Sumerian god Bnlil as an équivalent for baal, i.e. "lord"169. The use of sapôn for "North" affords another parallel. Ad (2) : This parallel becomes even closer if our second suggestion is accepted170. The word adôn is used only by the Phœnicians (also at Ugarit) and the Hebrews and there is no indication that the latter knew it before their immigration into 164 Syria 14 (1933) pl. XVI. 165 Adonis und Esmun (1911) esp. 65ff. 363ff. ; one will also consult J. G. Frazer, Adonis (1914); L. R. Farneil, The cults of the Greek states (1896ff.) II 752ff. ; id., Greece and Babylon (1911) 254ff., etc. 166 M. Lidzbarski in Ephemeris 3, 258. 167 The vowel -i- serves to connect the two elements of the name ; see M.

Dhorme, Les religions de Babylonie et d'Assyrie (1945) 26. 170 The writer was agreeably surprised to find that M. Noth (loc. laud. 72 and 125) con sidered Adonis to be "possibly pre-semitic"; cf. Baudissin p. 369.</page><page sequence="24">On the Etymology of the Name Sappho 35 Kanaan171. The word has no Semitic äff inities and it dénotés a god of a non-semitic character (Tammuz is Sumerian). The cult of the végétation god who dies and rises again and who is the son and the lover of the mother goddess, is Asianic. The verses in "The revolt of Koser": "Baal hates the offerings where ... the sex becomes visible and the maidens wail" (A 18) stress the antagonism of the Semitic god against the foreign cuit of Adonis. The god is called Adon in many Latin sources (including the oldest reference, by Varro); the same form is found as a name of persons who cannot have been Semites. One "Adon Lycius, Pisidise episcopus" was among the attendants of the Council of Nicsea. Theophrastus (quoted by Athenseus 624b) stated that Alcman mentioned a Phrygian flute-player Adon172. There appears then to be more than some reason for tracing Adôn—the god and the word—to Anatolia, where the cult of Attis affords the obvious parallel. 171 Baudissin p. 65. 172 Theophrastus quoted this name, with others, in evidence of the foreign and "slavelike" names of early Greek musicians. This fact alone should suffice to refute the ever récurrent attempts at finding a Greek etymologv for Adonis.</page></plain_text>
