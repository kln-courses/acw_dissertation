<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECENT EXPLORATIONS IN THE BHIWANI BLOCK, DISTRICT BHIWANI (HARYANA) NARENDER PARMAR* Bhiwani is one of the nineteen districts of Haryana. It was established by one Rajput Thakur Neem Singh, who named it after his wife, Bhani, in Chaitra Krishna paksh of samvat 1433 (26 Feb. 1376 A.D.). Tradition has it that Neem Singh was a Jat Rajput who came to Kaunt for residence. There he fell in love with a local Jat lady. Because of this, the Jat community became his enemy and plotted his murder. He left Kaunt village with a lady and married her and founded a village which he named as Bhani, now variously known as Bhaini, Bawani and Bhiwani. Bhiwani district has eight blocks and one of them bears the same name. The headquarters of both the district and block are being at Bhiwani. It includes 54 villages and occupies 61,474.98 hectares of land. The Bhiwani block lies between 28°37' to 29°01' North latitude and 76°01' to 76°19' East longitude. It is bounded on the north by Bawani Khera block, on the south by Charkhi Dadri block, on the east by Meham and Kalanur blocks and on the west by Tosham block. Exploration The region under present study is rich in archaeological wealth. The present researcher * Student of Institute of Archaeology (ASI), Red fort- Delhi conducted an extensive village-to-village survey of the area during February-March 2008 and as a result of this comprehensive survey 66 sites were explored in the revenue jurisdiction of Bhiwani block of district Bhiwani (Haryana) (Fig. 1). Out of them 40 sites were placed on the archaeological map of India for the first time. These sites range from Early Harappan to Medieval periods. Pottery and other associated finds of the different cultures were collected and studied. Majority of the sites are either under cultivation or modern occupation.

The region of present study is topographically divided in three parts. These are: alluvial plain, sand dunes and small hill range (in village Deosar). The Harappan settlements are found only in plain area because of the fertile land. The six early Harappan sites were visited during the explorations namely Mitathal, Chang-I, Chang-II, Manheru-I, Tigrana-I and Tigrana-II. The main centre during this period was Mitathal, where the excavator found a large pit with a flooring.

During explorations Black-on-Red Ware, Plain Ware, Bi-chrome Ware, Grey Ware, Incised Ware and Dull Red Ware are found in Early Harappan ceramic tradition. In paintings horizontal black bands on rim, neck and shoulder portion are mainly found. The earliest material remains of this culture are found from Siswal. The developing stages of pottery from their first stage to evolved stage have been also noticed at Siswal. The excavator had also reported the sherds of Mature Harapapn period from the surface of the mound. At Mitathal only evolved stage of the Early Harappan culture is found (Suraj Bhan, 1972:42-43). During the explorations seven sites of the Mature Harappan culture are found in present study region. These are Mitathal, Chang-I, Chang-II, Manheru-I, Dhanana-I, Tigrana-I and Tigrana-II. The Mature Harappan pottery collected from sites is wheel made sturdy red ware of medium to fine fabric. It is made of well levigated clay and fired to a red core. Some of the pots are treated with red slip and paintings with black colour on it. The main shapes include perforated jars, storage jars, goblet, dish-on-stand, bowls, etc. The painted designs are generally geometrical. The ten sites of Late Harappan period (Ajitpura, Chang-I, Dhanana-I, Tigrana-I, Tigrana-II, Mitathal, Manheru-I, Manheru-II, Kalinga-II and Kalinga-IV) are found in the region under study. Mitathal is the type site of Late Harappan period in this region. The pottery of late phase of the Harappan culture is found from the surface on large scale. The main pottery shapes of this period are vases, bowls, basins, handled pots, dish-on-stand including those with drooping rim, etc. The pigment on the surface is rare in this period. However, some incised sherds like those in the Bara pottery are also found from the surface during the course of exploration. The Bara ware had a very long survival. The early levels of Bara ware are represented at Sanghol, Dhermajra and Mahorana. And late phase of Bara culture are found from Mitathal-IIB and Banawali-III. Last phase of the Bara culture noticed at Bhagwanpura, Dadheri and Katpalon (Sahi,2006-07:150). Dr. R.S.Bisht, the excavator called it "Post- Indus" or Banawali-Bara Cultural complex as, according to him, it represents the third phase of the Bara ware culture, long after the Indus period (Bisht, 1982:1 13-124). At Banawali, this material was as well collected from large pits and kilns dug into the Mature Harappan deposit while the regular settlement lay immediately outside, to the east of the antecedent settlement. He also feels that similar situation prevails at Mitathal too (personal communication with Dr. R.S. Bisht). Of course the Late Harappan phase of Mitathal (Mitathal-IIB) is quite similar with Banawali-III, Sanghol-IB, Daulatpur I, Bagwanpura-IA and Dadheri IA.</page><page sequence="14">108 Bulletin of the Deccan College 68-69 (2008-2009) It is noteworthy that the Early Harappan ceramic tradition at Banawali continues throughout the mature phase, whereas at Kalibangan it survives only half-way and dies out. This possibly explains the presence of Early Harappan pottery in the Harappan and Late Harappan complexes at a number of sites in Haryana, for example, at Mitathal (Bisth, 1978: 88). A good number of Harappan antiquities were recovered from the present explorations, made of stone, semi-precious stones, steatite, faience, shell, copper, terracotta, bone, etc. The stone objects such as cubical and circular weight; saddle-quern, etc. were found. In semi precious stone carnelian beads, etched carnelian bead, agate beads, chert blades, bead made of lapis-lazuli etc. are found. The beads of steatite, shell and faience are also found during the explorations. An antimony rod made of copper was recorded from Tigrana- II. The terracotta objects are always found on large scale because it is the locally available raw material. The terracotta antiquities include animal figurines, beads, bangles, hubbed wheels, sling balls, triangular, eight shaped and idle-shaped cakes are common in large scale region under discussion. The idli-shaped cake is the characteristic feature of this region because they are found in large quantity and are of good quality. The faience bangles are also found in good number from the Harappan sites whereas at the Late Harappan sites. It may be possible that the Mitathal was the factory site of faience objects. (Please see related photographs) Following the then prevailing shorter chronology (c. 2350-1750 BC) for the Mature Harappan culture) as expounded by D.P. Agarwal on the basis of C-14 (uncalibrated) dates Surjan Bhan has framed Chronology for Mitathal. Since there are no C-14 dates from Mitathal, the excavator largely depended on Kalibangan on the one hand and on his own observations on the ceramics on the other for working out a chronology in which he nicely related other sites of Haryana and Punjab. During the Mitathal excavation the excavator has not got any C-14 dates and made its chronology from the other excavated sites such as Kalibangan. He had also decided its earliest date 2000 BCE (Suraj Bhan, 1975: 13- 17) The first phase of Mitathal is represented only by flooring, which occurs in a pit cut into the natural soil (Suraj Bhan, 1975:12) This unique tradition of pit dwellings, especially in the Early Harappan context of Hary ana region, was in practise as reported from Bhirana and Kunal. The dates for these pit dwellings goes for 7th-5th millennium BCE (6647-4353 BCE) (Rao, 2004-05:67-68) It may be possible that some sites in this region (Mitathal) are also as old as Bhirana and Kunal. Some scholars think that the OCP and Copper Hoards cultures are the two separate cultures. While some think that the makers of Copper Hoards are the OCP culture people. At Mitathal two harpoons and some copper rings commonly found in copper hoards were found by the villagers accidentally. In this region the copper hoards are not yet found in the context of OCP. So it is possible that Late Harappan people used these copper objects in</page><page sequence="15">Recent Explorations of the Bhiwani Block, District Bhiwani (Haryana) 109 a) Pot (Devsar) b) Bowl (Devsar) b) Stone Image (Badesara) this region. Sannauli excavation proves that the Late Harappan, OCP and Copper Hoard peoples could be the same. Another major area related to the Copper Hoards lies 70 km. south of Mitathal at the site of Ganeshwar (OCP site). The copper content from Bisauli anthropomorphic figure is 98.77%, while Ganeshwar has 97.0% and, further, seven copper objects of Mitathal ranges between 98.13% and 98.64% (Sahi, 2006-07:162). Hence, it may be possible that Bisauli, Ganeshwar and Mitathal copper objects are metallurgically similar. Recently, twenty four copper rings have come to the light from Farmana (20 km. north-east to Miththal) weighting net 750 gm. (personal communication with Prof. V. Shinde Deccan College Pune). If we consider the hydrography of this region, the picture is not much clear. According to Suraj Bhan one channel, which</page><page sequence="16">1 10 Bulletin of the Deccan College 68-69 (2008-2009) bifurcates from the western Yamuna canal at Uklana and flows via Bagru, Kirsola, Paoli, Farmana, Seman, Singhwa, Chang, Mitathal, Tigrana and Tosham should have been there in the past(Suraj Bhan, 1970: 1-4) The Kausiki River has flowed south of Drishadwati river as mentioned in literature. This river flowed between Rohitaka (present Rohtak) and Drishadwati river. This ancient river joins the Drishadwati near Hansi via Meham, Mitathal and Sangwan (ancient sarvajanapada) (Dukhi, 1986:21-23) A satellite picture also shows an ancient channel in this region. An ethno-archaeological study done by this explorer suggests that it might be possible that the present day Jaui feeder represents the flow of a dried up stream running through. Bedwa, Farmana, Seman, Bhani Chenderpal, Bhani Surjan, Bhani Matto, Bhani Mahrajpur, Puthi, Singwa, Chang, Mitathal, Tigrana and Dhanana. Now, it is a very fertile alluvial flat land which is dotted with many of the Harappan settlements located 1 or 2 km apart. In this region copper objects are found in a good quantity. Khetri would have been a prominent source of copper to the Harappan people living in Hary ana, Rajasthan, Punjab and Western Uttar Pradesh. Besides, Tosham and Khanak, seem to have provided much needed granite and quartzite for saddle-querns, mullers, pounders, grinding stones. Deosar and Kuliana hills are also source for this raw material (Bhiwani District Gazetteer, 1982: 13- 15) According to Law grinding stone reached Rakhigarhi via. Mitathal. Mitathal is about approximately 25 km. from Tosham hill, 30 km. from Khanak, and 12 km. from Deosar in the east and 35 km. from Kuliana in north- east directly. A P.G.W. site in this region is located on the meeting point of Meham and Bhiwani Blocks. The concentration of P.G.W. sites are found mainly north-east area of the Kalanour block and Meham Blocks. Meham Block contains 22 P.G.W. sites and Kalanour has 12 sites whereas in the south-western zone like Tosham Block P.G.W. sites are totally absent. If the locations of all protohistoric sites are put on a map an interesting cultural pattern emerges. The alluvial plains of paleao channels of ancient Drishadwati, Kaushiki, etc. are full of early, mature and late Harappan sites as well as those of P.G.W. and NBPW associated pottery assemblages. But, as soon as we move away from the fertile region and enter the dry area of sand, sand dunes and Aravalis outcrops, there is absence of P.G.W. and NBPW sites. However, the Bara related late Harappan settlements are strongly present and the Harappan are found occasionally. What was the nature and contents of Iron Age and Early Historical habitations are not yet clear or not yet identified. This situation seems to suggest that the arid zone Haryana, at least in the south, was not preferred by those who are absent and who only occupied the flood plain of flowing or desiccating rivers. One wonders whether the late Harappan ceramic/ cultural traditions lingered on and slowly got transformed perhaps into the Rang Mahal Ware whose origin is not yet fully clear. Furthermore, there is a huge time gap between the Late Harappan (1500 BCE) and Historical period (Yaudheyas- 2nd Century</page><page sequence="17">Recent Explorations of the Bhiwani Block, District Bhiwani (Hary ana) 111 BCE). It is one of the major problems in this area. What are the causes of cultural gap in this region? According to the present researcher the cultural gap in the prevailing environment of aridity (the Rajasthan desert starting from south-western parts of the Bhiwani Block) needs to understood properly this region. According to Mahabharata, Kuru kingdom was divided into three parts- Kurukshetra, Kuru-desha and Kuru-Jangala (Mahabhara, Sabhaparva, Chap. 35-4-5). Going by the prevailing belief, the Jangala tract was inhabited and represented by the presence of the P.G.W. sites in the exposed alluvial flats and the desert area perhaps lay outside of it and the region under study belongs to the Kuru-Jangala. In the region of the present study 16 sites of historical periods were found during the course of exploration. Out of them Naurangabad is a fortified city site claiming for 23 hectare of land rising to a height of about 11m. Its top surface is almost plain (Sengar, 2004- 05:191-195). The punch-marked, Yaudheya, Indo-Greek and Kushana coins and moulds are earlier reported from this site. It indicates that Naurangabad was a mint site of the above mentioned coins. The name Prakritanaka- nagara is found on a seal from Naurangabad. Hence, most of the scholar thinks that it was the ancient name of Naurangabad (Swami Omanand Saraswati, 1979:43-48). The historical pottery was found during the course of exploration as well. The major shapes are incurved-rimmed bowls, vases, spouted pots, basins, cups, lids, etc. Two stone architectural members found from Badesara and Devsar. Out of these one is a plinth portion of a temple (Devsar) and the other one shows a small image of an unknown female deity, khur and kumbha portions of an early stage temple (Badesara) in northern India. The other finds are: a terracotta Vishnu figurine, beads of various stones and terracotta human and animal figurines. The Gupta inscription in Tosham hill and the Gupta coins from Mitathal show that the region was under the imperial Guptas and earlier it was under the rule of the Yaudheyas, Indo-Greeks and Kushanas. However, the other historical sites are much smaller, not exceeding 3 or 4 hectares in size. Besides, fifty-two sites of Early Medieval and Medieval period have been found during the present course of explorations. These sites lie both in the, alluvial plains and sandy area. The historical sites are fewer in comparison with medieval ones. The pottery consists mainly red ware. The pots are wheel-made and generally have a medium to coarse fabric. It is painted with linear designs, decorated with incised horizontal lines. The main shapes are</page><page sequence="18">1 12 Bulletin of the Deccan College 68-69 (2008-2009) knife-edged bowls, basins, dishes, handis, jars, lids, vases, etc. Meham which is located in the northern side of the present study area (District Rohtak) seems to be the main centre. The architectural traditions still continue in the villages. Kharak-II has yielded the coins of Lodi rulers while Akbar Kharak I has those of Akbar. The later were issued from the Narnaul mint (district Mahendergarh). Mostly, the present habitations/villages are in this region are perched on the medieval mounds.
