<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Plovers, Sandpipers, and Snipes of the World By Paul A. Johnsgard In this book, intended as a companion to his earlier vol- ume, Ducks, Geese, and Swans of the World, Paul Johnsgard deals exhaustively with the classification, iden- tification, breeding biology, ecology, and evolution of the shorebirds. He supplies identification keys for all tribes, genera, and species included in the book. He then turns to individual species accounts of the 165 species he recog- nizes, supplementing them with distribution maps, draw- ings or diagrams illustrating species traits or comparative biological data, 59 black-and-white photographs, line drawings of all species, and 60 color plates. xx, 568 pages, notes, bibliography, index, illustrated. $45.00 University of Nebraska Press '9% 901 North 17th Street Lincoln 68588 SPECIAL PUBLICATIONS OF THE AOU (other than Ornithological Monographs) Proceedings 13th International Ornithological Congress, 1963 set: $10.00 (2 vols., 1,250 pp., cloth) [An outstanding bargain-G.E.W.

If so, is mankind's position in nature's hierarchy challenged? Donald R. Griffin attacks these and other questions in his revised and enlarged edition of The Ques6ion of Evolutionary Continuity of Mental Experience Dr. Griffin, a professor at The Rockefeller University and an inter- nationally recognized authority on animal behavior and physiology, renews and expands his attack on the long-held thesis that animals do not have mental experiences. In doing so, he marshals new evi- dence to support the hypothesis that a true science of cognitive etho- logy could be developed if investigators would shed their fears of anthropomorphism. Linguists, ethologists, behaviorists, philosophers, anthropolo- gists, and laymen interested in the world around them will be fascin- ated (and perhaps enraged) by Dr. Griffin's controversial arguments. 220 pp., bibliography, indexes Hardcover: ISBN 87470-035-3 $13.95 plus $3.00 postage and handling ($3.50 foreign) For your copy, write: The Rockefeller University Press Dept.

WIENS, Department of Biology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131 Assistant to the Editor: JEAN FERNER Editorial Board: JAMES R. KING, HELMUT C. MUELLER, RICHARD L. ZusI Associate Editors: WALTER BOCK (Reviews), HERBERT W. KALE, II (Periodical Liter- ature) THE AUK welcomes original reports dealing with the biology of birds, emphasizing the documentation, analysis, and interpretation of laboratory and field studies, theoretical or methodological developments, or reviews of existing information or ideas. Contributions are welcomed from throughout the world, but must be written in English. SUGGESTIONS TO CONTRIBUTORS. Submit the typewritten original and two copies of the text, tables, illustrations, and all other material to the Editor. All typewritten material must be double-spaced on one side of numbered 8?2 x 11 inch (21?/2 x 28 cm) good quality bond paper, with at least 1 inch (21/2 cm) margins. Originals typed on erasable, light weight, or mimeo bond will not be considered, but copies may be clear reproductions. Number pages through the Literature Cited. Avoid footnotes. The style of manuscripts should conform to general usage in recent issues. A cover page should contain the full title, a shortened version of the title (not to exceed 35 characters in length) for use as a running head, and your address at the time the research was conducted, followed by your present address, if different. The' cover page should also include the name and full address of the individual to whom proof is to be sent. Each Article should be preceded by an Abstract not exceeding 5% of the length of the paper. The Abstract should recapitulate the findings of the paper, not describe the work done. Acknowledgments should follow the text and precede the Literature Cited. Scientific and English names of birds always should be given where first mentioned in the text, and should follow the A.O.U. Check-list of North American Birds and supplements or the appropriate equivalent unless departures are explained and defended. Metric units should be used in all measurements. In general, abbreviations of statistical terms and mensural units should conform with the Council of Biology Editors (CBE) Style Manual. Use the 24-hour clock (0800 and 2030) and "continental" dating (1 July 1971). Tables, which must not duplicate material in either the text or illustrations, are typewritten (double- spaced throughout!) separately from the text. Each table should contain a short but complete heading, and must not contain vertical rulings. Illustrations (including labels of coordinates) should be on 81/2 x 11 inch (21?V2 x 28 cm) sheets, and must be mailed flat. The name of the author and the figure number should be penciled on the back of each figure. Legends should be typed consecutively (double-spaced) on a separate page. Drawings should be drafted with undiluted india ink, and be large enough to permit 1/3 to ?/2 reduction to the size that they will appear in print. Graphs may be drafted on coordinate paper ruled with light blue lines; do not use coordinate paper ruled with green lines. Use mechanical lettering, pressure transfer letters, or calligraphy; typewritten lettering is not acceptable. Lettering should be large enough to be easily readable after 50% reduction of the figure, but not overly large. Lettering style should be uniform among all figures for a manuscript, as should the size of lettering following reduction. Photographs should be glossy prints of good contrast and sharpness, and should be approximately the same size as they will appear in print. Letters and arrows on photographs are best applied by pressure-sensitive materials. In articles containing more than five references, the citations are listed (double-spaced!) in a Literature Cited section following the text and Acknowledgments. For five or fewer references, cite them in the text following these examples: Sauer (1972, Auk 39: 717), or (Sauer 1972, Auk 39: 717). Text citations should include author and year (e.g. Darwin 1858), or, if more than two authors are involved, the first author and year (Jones et al. 1947). If critical matter is cited or quoted directly from longer works, indicate the pertinent pages (e.g. MacArthur 1972: 204-207). Citations of two or more works on the same topic should be cited in chronological order (e.g. Meanley 1971, Dyer 1975). For abbreviations and forms of titles of serial publications, follow the BIOSIS List of Serials. Consult recent issues of The Auk and the CBE Style Manual for additional details. A more detailed set of instructions for contributors appeared in The Auk, Vol. 94, No. 1 (January 1977), copies of which are available from the Editor.</page><page sequence="5">ORNITHOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS Order from Glen E.
