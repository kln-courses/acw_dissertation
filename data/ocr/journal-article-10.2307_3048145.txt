Pp. 401; 454 pls.; 142 col. pls. $25.oo. Except for Die Kunst Irans zur Zeit der Sasaniden by Kurt Erdmann (Berlin, 1943) and the relevant sections of the Survey of Persian Art, the full range of Sassanian art has received no detailed study prior to the publication of the book under review (a volume in the series, The Arts of Mankind, edited by Andr6 Malraux and Georges Salles). Publications covering Parthian art have been even less comprehensive be- cause so much that casts light on that troubled period has only recently been uncovered, e.g., at Dura, Hatra, Palmyra, and Nysa. Attempts to define Parthian style have also involved much tentative and controversial discussion of "Parthian frontality," often in relation to comparable changes in Roman art.' The major merit of Persian Art lies in the author's treatment of the arts of both periods in relation to each other and to the continuing mainstream of Iranian art. Although this may seem the natural way to treat period styles of any area, Parthian and Sassanian art have usually been discussed as separate and rather un- characteristic episodes in the course of Iranian art because of the effects of Hellenization on the Near and Middle East, the relative lack of historical infor- mation, and the scarcity of excavated objects. In the Introduction Ghirshman discusses the dif- ficult theoretical problems that underlie the art of this period: the origin of Parthian frontality, and the iden- tity of the predominating influences in each of the strains that make up the different schools of Near Eastern Hellenistic art and that are known from Nysa (Russian Turkestan), Surkh Kotal (Afghani- stan), Gandhara, Mathura, Kuh-i Khwaja (Seistan), Nimrud Dagh (Commagene), and South Russian sites. Prominence is given two recent studies by E. Will and D. S. Schlumberger in which Parthian art, as characterized by frontality and other features, is derived from the widespread Greco-Iranian art of the post-Alexandrian period.2 To Ghirshman, these solu- tions overstate the case in favor of Greek influence. Throughout the work he refers Parthian frontality back to native Iranian tradition-to Luristan, to Siyalk B, and to the new wave "of Iranian nomads from Outer Iran whose figural art was based on this for- mula" (p. 7)V. It is unfortunate that we have no ob- jects demonstrating the continued strength of this hereditary principle among the earliest Parthian re- i. E.g., M. Rostovtzeff, "Dura and the Problem of Parthian Art," Yale Classical Studies, v, 1935, pp. 155-304, especially pp. 240ff., and "L'Art greco-iranien," Revue des arts asiatiques, VII, 1931-32, pp. 202-222; C. Hopkins, "Aspects of Parthian Art," Berytus, III, 1936, pp. 1-3o, and "A Note on Frontality in Near Eastern Art," Ars Islamica, III, 1936, pp. 187-196; G. Rodenwaldt, "Ara Pacis und S. Vitale," Bonner Jahrbiicher, cxxxIII, 1928, pp. 228-235, and "Zur Kunstgeschichte der Jahre 22o bis 270," Jahrbuch des Deut- schen arch'iologischen Instituts, LI, 1936, pp. 82-113, esp. p. I07, and "RSmische Reliefs, Vorstufen zur Spaitantike," ibid., LV, 1940, pp. 12-43, esp. p. 37. Such changes were studied by A. Riegl, Die Spiitr6mische Kunstindustrie, Vienna, 190o, and J. Strzygowski, Orient oder Rom, Leipzig, 19i01, before Parthian art as such was known in any quantity or had received definition. 2. E. Will, Le Relief cultuel greco-romain, Paris, 1955, esp. Ch. Iv; D. S. Schlumberger, "Descendants non-mediter- raneens de l'art grec," Syria, xxxvII, 196o, pp. 131-x66, 253- 3x8. Schlumberger's discussion of the originality of Parthian art began as a commentary on this chapter of the Will work and accepted as a premise Will's explanation for the develop- ment of Parthian frontality: abandonment by the Parthians of the classical Greek law of frontality in statuary, and the general rule of profile representation in relief, and the com- bination of the two into a narrative art in which subjects rendered frontally expressed the special power originally re- served for statues (pp. 256-257, 262-264). The whole de- velopment was found by Will to have its origin in prin- ciples of preclassical Greek art. But Will's analysis is founded upon a survey of the earlier oriental tradition which, although acknowledging certain cultic frontal representations in Meso- potamia, entirely excludes the Iranian manifestations of frontality (e.g., in the Luristan bronzes, at Siyalk B). This omission enables Will to discard the theory of Iranian influ- ence upon the West. His apparently credible analysis of the formal change is therefore only a partial answer. It follows that Ghirshman, with his deep knowledge of Iranian tra- dition, and Will are at cross purposes in the discussion of these stylistic developments. Since the publication of Persian Art, Will has added an- other chapter to the debate with Schlumberger, "L'Art sas- sanide et ses predecesseurs," Syria, xxxIx, 1962, pp. 45-63; in this more cursory study he advances another reason (or de- fines his original solution) for the triumph of Parthian frontality. It is, he says, a manifestation of primitivism, "qui constitue en dernibre analyse la frontalite: on se trouverait, de fait, devant une evolution inflechie par l'art 'populaire' au detriment de l'art 'aulique.' Ce serait l1, en tout cas, une manibre de rendre intelligible une evolution surprenante au premier abord" (pp. 48-49). This is a simplification the re- viewer cannot accept. Although Will has not taken into ac- count earlier Iranian manifestations of frontality, he here appears to notice a frequent characteristic of art in Iran, the simultaneous existence of native tradition and official art (see below and note 5). If, as Ghirshman believes, frontality is a native tradition, then its increased currency would demonstrate a use by official art of its native vocabulary. But it is difficult to see the style-change entirely as a Greek (Will) or Iranian (Ghirshman) development, or in these predominantly formal terms. I am not ready (as is Will) to discount the importance to the discussion of parallel tendencies in the East, or (with Ghirshman) of influences from the West. New forms of government, new forms of worship, arose and conditioned these stylistic developments in the East and West, and it may be that in the study of these developments we shall be able to establish what is Greek, what Iranian, and what is due to these common historical conditions. 3. Ghirshman finds the mask, "the face cut off at the neck," a key feature of this tradition; for full discussion and bibliography, see R. Ghirshman, Fouilles de Ch~pour, Blchdpour, II (Musee du Louvre, DNpartement des antiquites orientales, Serie archeologique, T. viI, 1956), pp. xx9-134.</page><page sequence="2">96 THE ART BULLETIN mains at Nysa (where the accent is strongly Greek). For that matter, we have no remains known to be- long to Parthian nomad art. Yet one feels that two arts existed in the Parthian empire, an underlying native tradition and a more self-conscious official art in which elements of other artistic traditions play a part.4 This is a situation that has parallels in other periods of Iranian art. The native tradition is revealed in the art of Luristan and Siyalk B (the official art would be Assyrianizing Elamite) and although, to our present knowledge, the undercurrent remains largely concealed in the Achaemenian period (except perhaps for some of the later Luristan bronzes), the distinguishing characteristic of that official art is com- parable to the earlier official art: foreign and native elements composed into an over-all, original, decora- tive style.5 The book is divided into three parts; Part Three comprises all the reference tools normally supplied in this series. The bibliography and glossary should be of great help to students. Occasionally the measure- ments of an object are lacking in the list of plates, and a few names are misspelled in the bibliography. Most of the plates showing seal impressions are mistakenly labeled intaglios (e.g., pls. 294-301). The publication of so many fine photographs, many of them previously available only in excavation reports or periodicals, makes the book most useful. The three chapters of Part One give a fairly com- plete account of Parthian art from its beginnings at Nysa--and of Sassanian art, including some objects that are post-Sassanian in the section on the "sumptu- ary arts." The varied monuments are pulled into a coherent relation by the intelligent summaries at chap- ter endings. A few questions are raised by the text. Ghirshman overemphasizes the Iranian and Meso- potamian aspects of the fresco of the sacrifice of Conon at Dura (p. 47). The placement of the figures within and against an independent and continuing architec- tural frame, the unevenness of the hems, the rippling drapery of the priest's gown and on the left figure's bent arm, are features that derive from the West. The true flavor of Dura is in the combination of Near Eastern and Roman and Hellenistic features, not in the predominance of the Iranian strain. On the problem of the origin of the scenes of in- vestiture in Parthian and Sassanian art, the author rightly derives these representations from an Achae- menid prototype, seen on royal tombs or at Persepolis, in which the symbolic rendering of Ahura Mazdah extends a ring to the sacrificing king (p. 262). On page 133 Ghirshman postulates the existence of the royal investiture on horseback in Achaemenid art on the basis of its occurrence on a Scythian rhyton from south Russia." The representation on this rhyton, al- though fragmentary, does not appear to be a scene of investiture in the Iranian sense. This interpretation is probably due to its association by Rostovtzeff with later tablets from the Danube regions on which a goddess of rather uncertain identity bestows a ring on confronted rider-gods.' In some Parthian coin renderings which have been interpreted as investitures, the Xhvarnah is bestowed upon the king by a Nike; occasionally the king is shown on horseback.s In Achaemenian times the rendering of Ahura Mazdah, so far as we know at present, was limited to the bust in the sundisk, and was not fully anthropomor- phic. On many coins, the Parthians translated the symbolic deity into Greek terms---Nike or Tyche. But the occurrence of cult reliefs, near Palmyra and at Dura, showing rider-gods (one with a heraldic com- position), whose dating parallels the Danubian tablets, 4. The French, as M. Ghirshman here (and E. Will, note 2 above), generally distinguish this official art by the term aulic. "Official" or "court art" might be used in English to avoid this rather precious term. The same suggestion applies to the term intaglio used through the book: "seal" is the simpler word in common use. 5. See, e.g., H.

I, and Skythien und der Bosporus, I, Berlin, 1931, pp. 323ff.; on p. 328, Rostovtzeff dates the Karagodeuaschkh kurgan (where the rhyton was found) and its contents in the first half of the third century, or at the latest, the second half or beginning of the second century B.C. 7. Rostovtzeff (Bull. de la Comm. arch., IL) pl. vII (lead, terra-cotta, stone plaques), p. 42, characterizes this kind of scene as the commemoration of a victory in which mounted, military gods are represented. (I owe the translation of this passage to the kindness of Dr. Mish of the New York Pub- lic Library.) So far as can be seen, there is no figure of a goddess between them on the rhyton. It predates the Danubian tablets, usually dated 2nd-3rd century A.D., and it is question- able whether it can be related to their complex iconography. The implication of victory in these scenes is generally agreed upon. The presence of supine bodies, regarded as the distin- guishing feature of the Danubian tablets as compared to renderings of the Thracian rider, is very interesting on this earlier object. See D. Tudor, "I Cavalieri danubiani," Ephemeris Dacoromana, vII, 1937, pp. 189-356, and E. Will, Le Relief cultuel, pp. 93ff. E. H. Minns (Scythians and Greeks, Cambridge, 1913, p. 190) described the figures on the rhyton as "figures of bar- barian horsemen." No ring appears to mark the rendering as an investiture or victory celebration, and the horsemen are not differentiated in costume or headdress; one rests a spear on the ground, the other raises his hand in greeting or re- spect, and corpses appear below the horses. This last feature also occurs on Sassanian horseback investiture reliefs and some of Shapur I's triumph reliefs. 8. E. Herzfeld, Iran in the Ancient East, New York, 1941, p. 295, fig. 388; W.

There is thus the possibility of a formal influence from objects such as the tablets (a faint possibility, because of their limited range and special significance) or from heraldic and non-heraldic Par- thian horseback representations. But the iconography-- the heraldic investiture of a king by an anthropomor- phic god---should probably be traced from this late, provincial Parthian relief. In further reference to Sassanian rock relief, there is no reason to assume that the queen is represented in Bahram II's relief at Naqsh-i Rustam (pp. 170-171 ).10 At Barm-i Dilak and Sar Meshed she is clearly dif- ferentiated by headdress, so that even the abbreviated view of this relief reveals her identity. To the right of this relief, which was cut over a neo-Elamite work (possibly in turn carved over an even earlier Elamite relief) is visible one figure from that older work. It may be that the combination of frontal thorax and profile head, which occurs on the flanking figures here and elsewhere in the rock reliefs, owes something to this older mode and is not a reaction against Hel- lenism (p. Io). Ghirshman sees in the Sassanian re- liefs an adherence to exclusively frontal and side-view figures that is not borne out by careful study. Especially in the reliefs of Shapur I, and probably under Roman influence, some of the leading subjects are rendered in a three-quarter view. (This comment, and the one preceding it, present an unfortunate difficulty for the reader: remarks that elucidate material treated in de- tail are often separated and attached to more general discussion, where they may not be specifically noted.) In the treatment of textiles (amplified, according to an introductory note, by Mme. Clemence Duprat) we might have been told how much is still conjecture in a field in which so little can be definitely called Sassanian, or even dated. The group of heavy silk twills in a limited color range, with stylized pairs of confronted animals (rams, lions) in roundels (pp. 232-233) has been discussed by Miss Dorothy Shep- herd and given more specific attribution and dating.11 In Part Two (Chapter Iv, "The Parthians and the Oriental Koine," Chapter v, "The Diffusion of Sas- sanian Art") Ghirshman talks very broadly about the vast areas of the East and West that came under the influence of Iranian style and iconography, or, during the Parthian period, displayed similar tastes and developments. In Chapter Iv, the description of art under the Achaemenids as "exclusively Persian" (p. 277) may be objected to (see remarks about official art above and note 5), as well as the stress on a delib- erate and conscious development of Parthian style ac- cording to the principles of the Luristan bronzes, in the summary (p. 280). Chapter v is a sweeping account of the influence of Sassanian art in architecture, religious iconography, and the fine arts, which points out its vast area and duration of influence (e.g., Romanesque architecture, mediaeval silks, central Asian painting, Japanese textiles, T'ang figurines), often without describing the links of the chain. It is fashionable to ridicule this kind of general- ization, so much of which must remain undocumented. But such observations call our attention to the large designs that cross the boundaries of our compartmented studies. The only danger is that the inexperienced reader may take some of the author's conjectures for fact. A few comments should be added here regarding statements in this chapter related to the factual mat- ters already discussed. Perhaps the use of the term "continuous narrative" (p. 284) in reference to Sas- sanian rock reliefs is due to misunderstanding by the translator. On page 287 Ghirshman makes clear his awareness of their "condensed" iconography. The mirror image in a textile in the Shoso-in, the author feels, is one that "would never have suggested itself to a Persian artist" (fig. 444 and p. 333). A Chinese textile excavated at Palmyra12 indicates that such a motive may have been introduced into the Near East at a much earlier date. Its persistence, or per- haps re-introduction, is attested by Buyid (pre-Mongol) silks."1 In addition to an essential reference volume, Ghirsh- man has given us a provocative and suggestive essay on the far-reaching connections of Sassanian art that will stimulate future students of the field.

The group has been attributed to Zan- dane, a textile center near Bukhara which is mentioned in historical accounts. The Huy silk was dated 7th century, the group 7th-8th century. Discoveries and studies such as this will help us to distinguish peripheral styles and official Sas- sanian textile art. 12. R.
