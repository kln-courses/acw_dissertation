<plain_text><page sequence="1">Inevitably there must be mistakes: Th. Gaspey's The Life and Times of the good Lord Cobham, London, 1844, refers to an ancestor of the creator of Stowe. The reference to a letter by Pope, supposedly written to Lord Bathurst, of September 23rd, 1719, is no longer considered to be of this date, nor thought to have been addressed to him, nor does it contain what Dr. Dobai says it does: Pope does not there suggest that garden buildings should be of mixed styles. As the work of an outsider it is refreshingly free from the usual infighting of the experts in the field. Authors are quoted wherever they have published and whoever they are. Blissfully the footnotes are at the foot of the page and the direct quotations are left in the original English. There are very few mis- prints. The book is clearly set out and beauti- fully printed and even the 6 pt. letters are legible. The only drawback is the lack of an index, for which we have to wait until the third volume is out. Most tiresome, but also due to publication on the installment plan as it were, is the inability of the author to refer for matter to come, by page numbers but by sections; unfortunately that is also mostly the case for matter already discussed. This is a crazy world in which a Hungarian writes a book in German on matters English; however, we must be most grateful to the Schweizerischen Nationalfonds zur Forde- rung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung to sponsor such a work, to enable the author to write the book and the publisher to publish it. S. LANG Robert Rosenblum, Modern Painting and the Northern Romantic Tradition, Friedrich to Rothko, New York, Harper &amp; Row, 1975. 240 pp., 314 ills., $17.50. The close affinity between Northern Roman- ticism and Expressionism has long been noted and parallels between early 19th-century Northern artists and their 20th-century des- cendants have been observed and docu- mented. The Expressionists as well as the German Romantics searched for a unity of the self with the universe. Both opposed the de- humanization, materialism, and purely intel- lectual explanations of phenomena they saw in their time. The German Romantics were at odds with the rationalism of the Enlighten- ment and the Expressionists were opposed to positivist and pragmatist attitudes; they were both engaged in a transcendental search for the spirit. In the 19th century Novalis and Fichte rejected matter in favor of the Ideal. Kandinsky, a century later, would simply postulate that "it is the spirit that rules over matter, not the other way around." In 1804, Jean Paul (Richter) in his Vorschule fur Aesthetik proclaimed that "the most powerful thing in the poet, which blows the good and evil spirit into his works, is precisely the un- conscious." Almost 130 years later, Emil Nolde stated a similar concept but announced it more vociferously, when he wrote: "Whoever relies on his small brain, acknowl- edges his limitations. Instinct is ten times more important than knowledge." The ideas were very much the same, but the tone had changed. Nolde's statement was much more emphatic, as were the declara- tions by Kandinsky and Franz Marc. The as- sertive Blue Rider had replaced the more pas- sive and contemplative Blue Flower of an ear- lier time. In the same manner Jackson Pol- lock's affirmation "I am nature" is a much more blunt expression of the Romantic theory of organic cosmology, in which the artist identifies with growing forms in nature, than was Wordsworth's simple allusion to "a crea- tive soul endowed with a power matching na- ture's own." The total aesthetic experience of synaes- thesia, the Gesamtkunstwerk, which was cer- tainly Kandinsky's greatest goal, goes back further than Richard Wagner's music dramas and was, in fact, postulated by August Wil- helm Schlegel a hundred years before Kan- dinsky. The turning away from the empirical world toward the experience of the inner self and its ultimate manifestation in abstract art on the part of the Expressionists was clearly foreseen a century earlier when Novalis de- clared that "in our view, to retreat into one- self means to abstract from the external world." It was through instinct, through vitalistic modes of expression, that the longed-for unity with the universe could be obtained and the comprehension of the world as Mysterium could be achieved. German Romantics felt great affinity with the earlier German mys- tics, with Meister Eckhardt and Jacob Boehme, while the Expressionist acknowl- edged the same masters and, in addition, found inspiration and affirmation in Eastern philosophy, brought to their attention, princi- pally, by Mme. Blavatzky and her Theosophi- cal teachings. Both Romantics and Expres- sionists saw art as the greatest manifestation of the human spirit and the means by which being itself could be grasped. For this reason the artist was considered as a prophet who could penetrate to the depths, understanding both divinity as well as humanity. In fact, for both Romantic and Expressionist, true art was almost synonymous with religion and the artist, in Shelley's words, becomes the "un- acknowledged leader of the world." Robert Rosenblum in his new book does not scrutinize many of these fascinating parallels between Northern Romantic and Expression- ist aesthetics and art theory. Instead he ana- lyzes the works of artists who follow the Northern tradition and gives an "alternate reading to the history of modern art which might supplement the orthodox one that has as its almost exclusive locus Paris, from David and Delacroix to Matisse and Picasso." In this penetrating, small volume, based on a series of lectures delivered at Oxford Uni- versity in the Spring of 1972, Professor Rosen- blum goes beyond a mere comparison of Ro- mantic and Expressionist art. He sees a long, almost continuous tradition extending from Caspar David Friedrich to the immediate past in American painting, a tradition which op- poses the French "art for art's sake" with the belief of "art for life's sake." The first painting reproduced is Friedrich's well-known Monk by the Sea, which has long been compared to those Feininger Baltic sea- scapes in which a lone human figure stands at the edge of the sea and becomes part of a limitless world. It is astonishing, however, to see Friedrich's great painting juxtaposed to a large 1950s canvas by Mark Rothko. Rosen- blum moves far beyond the familiar territory when he postulates this enduring "Northern" tradition in which Friedrich's haunting, empty, boundless painting relates to Rothko's "static expanse of dematerialized, luminous color." According to Rosenblum, Rothko's Green on Blue is in closer inner accord to Friedrich's painting than to Courbet's The Artist at the Seashore at Palavas of 1854, although the French painter's composition is in formal terms almost identical to Friedrich's. Cour- bet's work, however, is seen as a thoroughly egotistical picture of himself shouting his fame out to sea. Similarly Turner's "blinding blizzards and tempestuous seas" are com- pared to Pollock's "dynamic whirlpool of equally boundless energy." Rosenblum's hy- pothesis of a northern Romantic tradition is at a far remove from Wolfflin's more formalis- tic "deutsches Formgefuhl." He comes much closer to Panofsky who stressed the impor- tance of art history, not as a mere comparison of formal structures, but as the humanistic search for the original intention. This is pre- cisely what Robert Rosenblum has set out to do. To point up the contrast between the Northern attitude and that of France, the author counterposes Friedrich's Polar Sea of 1824 and Turner's Fighting Temeraire of 1838, both poignant symbols of death at sea, "mari- time ghosts that evoke metaphors of spiritual journeys" with the altogether different sensi- bility of Gericault's Raft of the Medusa, a painting which, though dealing with the cruel forces of nature, remains basically an- thropocentric. Rosenblum sees three major Northern art- ists at the end of the 19th century as repre- senting the survival or revival of Northern Romanticism: van Gogh, Munch, and Hodler. In these painters he perceives a "passionate search for religious truth in a world of empiri- cal observation." Some of his attempts to show similarities seem to this reviewer to push the issue, as when he relates van Gogh's pulsating, indeed almost hallucinatory Starry Night to Carl Gustav Carus' Gothic Church and Tree Tops in the Moonlight, which also has a medieval church silhouetted against the night sky but remains a rather comfortable, contemplative picture. Edvard Munch, in- stead of being considered as a post-Impres- sionist, is quite convincingly perceived as ex- tending the Northern tradition with its Scan- dinavian melancholy and disturbing tension ART JOURNAL, XXXVI/1 84</page><page sequence="2">with nature. The author contrasts Munch's Dance of Life, a painting which reveals hu- man destiny, with Renoir's Dance at Bougival in which a lovely young couple simply enjoys sensual pleasure, just as he counterposes van Gogh's Sower with Millet's prototype. The Dutch (Northern) painter, instead of a rather literary idealization of the good peasant at work, paints a solitary figure against an em- blematic setting sun, located symbolically in the center of the horizon, a motif also found in Munch's large mural for the Great Hall of the University of Oslo -"a symbol of nature's om- nipotence." The motif of the sun, set symboli- cally in the very center of the painting, which occurs first in Friedrich's transcendental Sea with Sunrise, 1826, is traced by the author up to Max Ernst's The Entire City of more than a century later. Ferdinand Hodler's large visionary Sym- bolist paintings of Night and Day certainly recall Runge's great projects for the Times of Day, and the Swiss painter's stark frozen mountain peaks evoke a sense of awe first experienced in the sublime landscape paint- ing of the Romantics, but they also point ahead, as I suggested in my Hodler mono- graph (1972) when I compared one of Hodler's ominous and mysterious mountain paintings, with its floating luminous cloud-shapes which almost impinge on each other, to Rothko's painting a half-century later. When dealing with Northern painters of the Romantic tradition at the end of the 19th century the omission of the satanic works by James Ensor is inexplicable. Here was an artist of extreme disquietude, a man haunted by skeletons, masks, and demons, preoccu- pied with death (as were Munch and Hodler), and possessed with religious images to a point of possible self-identification with Christ. Also, Rosenblum omits German painters of the late 19th century, men like Bocklin, Klinger, and Stuck, whose mythological pic- tures and romanticized classical dreams are of an entirely different character, but who, in their own admittedly more literary visions, relate to certain aspects of the metaphysical concerns and "pathetic fallacy" of the Roman- tics. Furthermore, here the connection is very direct: Bocklin's early landscapes of ca. 1850 are directly indebted to Friedrich, and Franz von Stuck, one of Bocklin's greatest admirers, was teacher to both Kandinsky and Klee. The relationship of German Expressionists to the Romantic painters has, as mentioned above, been evident for a long time, as exem- plified in the lonely landscapes by Emil Nolde with their infinite horizons or his paintings of the ocean in which, as I wrote in my mono- graph on the artist in 1963: "a diffuse light dematerializes the seascapes in a manner reminiscent of the late work by Turner, its still mood and fusion of sea and sky suggest- ing infinity." Rosenblum draws similar anal- ogies with Romantic painting in the pantheis- tic work by Franz Marc, the apocalyptic vi- sions by Vasily Kandinsky and their ultimate rejection of the tangible world. Klee's paint- 86 ings of the metamorphoses in nature and Feininger's transparent Gothic churches and his crystalline Baltic seascapes relate to Friedrich, whether or not he knew the Ro- mantic master's paintings at the time. A more conscious transformation of Romantic painting into the modern idiom is seen in some of Graham Sutherland's images of thorns and in Max Ernst's visionary and haunting extraterrestrial forests which are based on a knowing admiration of his Roman- tic forebears. In fact, by 1960 Ernst entitled a canvas of a great primeval thicket: The Al- most Late Romanticism. The last part of Rosenblum's book, dealing with "Transcendental Abstraction" is the most provocative. He correctly sees the road to abstraction - at least outside of Paris - as a liberation from the empirical world and a search for the spiritual. This he observed in Kandinsky and in the final works by Franz Marc and, above all, in the mystical and metaphysical creations of the early Mon- drian. He traces the Dutch artist's work from early landscapes that have a truly Friedrich- ian look or his portraits of stark iconic sym- metry similar to those of Asmus Jakob Car- stens, Samuel Palmer, Hodler, and Munch. He discusses Mondrian's search for the super- natural in the natural in his symbolic paint- ings of single anthropomorphic flowers and he notes the spiritual mystery in Mondrian's paintings of lonely trees, Gothic churches, and remote lonely seashores-the very sub- jects which had occupied Caspar David Fried- rich. Finally, when Mondrian renounced the empirical world completely in his early ab- stractions of the ocean and the church facade of 1914 and 1915, he uses a Cubist vocabulary for the quasi-religious purpose of erasing the material aspects of the world to create pure linear energies which, interestingly enough, assume the form of the cross. The reader who is accustomed to the worn-out formalistic in- terpretation of Mondrian's work can only ad- mire Rosenblum's empathetic insights into the works of Holland's great spiritual painter who, eventually, attempted to suppress all apparent emotion for the sake of pure and universal visual harmonies. Rosenblum concludes the book with a chap- ter on Abstract Expressionism, where similar metaphysical impulses to find universal myths and to create spiritual icons made themselves felt after the cataclysm of World War II. He focuses on Still, Pollock, Gottlieb, Newman, and Rothko and finds an American precedent to some of these artists in the paintings by Augustus Vincent Tack. This reviewer has been familiar with and fasci- nated by Tack's unexpected abstractions (at the Phillips Gallery in Washington) for many years but does not share the author's enthusi- asm for these semi-abstract landscapes. They resemble but do not equal in evocative sensi- bility the still little known but somewhat similar and much earlier abstractions of mountains and flowers by the Swiss painter Augusto Giacometti. While Tack's All Souls triptych may belong to the Romantic tradi- tion, it certainly is a part of its most senti- mental wing. Rosenblum is very convincing when relating Gottlieb's symmetric Burst se- ries of heavenly orbs to earlier American pro- totypes such as Dove's "pictorial hymns to the pagan mysteries of the moon" or to O'Keeffe's early watercolors, which were often emblem- atic equivalents of elemental forces. He re- lates Clyfford Still not only to Tack but also to the American landscape, an interpretation certainly not shared by the artist. But we cannot deny that Still does, perhaps in an indirect manner, belong to the Romantic tra- dition as do the organic nature-related can- vases by Jackson Pollock which even bear titles like Autumn Rhythm, Ocean Greyness, etc. Their "Gestalt-free matrix" (Anton Eh- renzweig's term) and agitated energy relate to Turner's world of a century earlier and some of us have indeed looked at Turner through Pollock's eyes. Barnett Newman early on spoke of Pol- lock's "ritualistic will," a term perhaps even more applicable to his own work, which, ac- cording to Rosenblum "provides a visual met- aphor for divine creation and in its passionate insistence on projecting spaces of boundless sublimity Newman's Command bears com- parison with Blake's Ancient of Days, who emerges from fearful chaos and with his piercing compasses - more shafts of light than palpable matter-imposes a shaping will upon the universe's shapeless beginnings." Ultimately in his series of the Stations of the Cross, Newman creates metaphors of black and white "transforming the corporeal Pas- sion into a spiritual one." Mark Rothko had always indicated his ad- miration for the Romantics and their search for the transcendental. Rosenblum relates Rothko's "symmetry and luminous empti- ness" back to O'Keeffe, Mondrian, and Hodler and to Turner's dissolution of matter as well as to "Friedrich who also placed the spectator before an abyss." Rothko's dark and somber paintings, his surfaces of contemplation, have found a place for meditation in his Chapel in Houston. Without resorting to any conven- tional ritual Rothko has created large tragic panels, icons that can evoke an authentic re- ligious experience in our secularized time. In an article "The Romantics were Prompted," published in 1947, Mark Rothko announced that "pictures must be miraculous." This clearly includes him as part of the Northern Romantic tradition so brilliantly traced by Robert Rosenblum in a book which must also be commended for its excellence in typogra- phy and design.
