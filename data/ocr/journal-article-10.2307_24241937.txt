<plain_text><page sequence="1">Patricia Vigderman The Real Life of the Parthenon Yes, but what can I say about the Parthenon—that my own ghost met me, the girl of 23, with all her life to come: that; &amp; then, this is more compact &amp; splendid &amp; robust than I remem bered. The yellow pillars — how shall I say? gathered, grouped, radiating there on the rock, against the most violent sky.... The Temple like a ship, so vibrant, taut, sailing, though still all these ages. It is larger than I remembered, &amp; better held together. Perhaps I've washed off something of the sentimentality of youth, which tends to make things melancholy. Now I'm 50 ... now I'm grey haired &amp; well through with life I suppose I like the vital, the flourish in the face of death. Then there's Athens like crumbled egg shells beneath ... Virginia Woolf, Diary, April 1932 To travel in search of the past is a well-known fool's errand, and yet the past needs living attention from people willing to risk themselves in its elsewhere to make it real. Previous time waits, hidden, and also asking for admittance to the present. When I myself was young and melancholy, that famous ruined Temple on its rubble-strewn mount was part of my college summer landscape. Before Greece was an easy tourist destination, when the back streets of Athens often turned out to be unpaved and the newly constructed Athens Hilton was a daring speculation about the future, my parents were posted to the American Embassy there. With all my life to come, however, the Parthenon and 129</page><page sequence="2">The Kenyon Review the vanished world it implied were mostly backdrop to my inarticu late desires for the gripping present and the hazy future. My mind could not find a resting place among the old, bitten marble on the Acropolis; my summers were whitewashed islands, late afternoon cafés, and oleander-lined roads toward the beaches. I was aware that there had once been a great processional frieze adorning the broken old temple, that large fragments of it had been removed a century and a half previously by a British lord, and that those beautiful sculptures now belonged to the British Museum in London. Lord Elgin's theft, I understood at the time, had rescued them from further deterioration; I also understood their loss was felt as a humiliating outrage by contemporary Greeks. That fragment of my ephemeral life, left in the same place as the enduring Greek past, now radiates across the years, unexpectedly vital decades later. Old, bitten things are more interesting now, and international quarrels over the proper geographical location of classical antiquities like the Parthenon marbles feel unexpectedly personal. As memory has it, the guarding of the entrance to the Acropolis was rather easygoing back then, and I'd once walked up in the moon light with a man I was briefly in love with on the evening before he was to leave Greece. The moment seemed unreal, an absurdly roman tic situation, unnecessary finale to our last evening. The white naked ness of the past rose above the shadowy guardedness of the present: the man, being older than I was, knowing we would not see each other again; me stumbling in my flimsy sandals on the stones. The national treasure, the ancient patrimony, stood on its fortress rock, the object of so much imaginative attention and so many complex desires, like mine on that summer night so far in the past by this time they might as well have occurred in the Periclean age. On my way back to college that September I stopped in London to see the marbles Lord Elgin had removed from Ottoman-occupied Athens: broken, still majestic sculptures of the gods from the pedi ments, seven metopes showing men and centaurs in violent conflict, and, running the length of the rather chilly Duveen Gallery, the pro cession of Athenian citizens toward a group of seated gods from the great frieze that had run along the outside of the temple's large inte rior chamber. White and silent observers of the fickle crowd, lovely wanderers, they seemed no more missing from the place I'd just been 130</page><page sequence="3">Patricia Vigderman than I did. As the years passed, they seemed more and more settled in the British Museum, part of that venerable monument to human curiosity and colonial power. Meanwhile, the Temple like a ship still sailed vibrant and taut, and battles over other fragmentary remains of the ancient world were challenging the old motives of human curiosity and the venerability of colonial power. Return of the Parthenon marbles to Greece had been proposed as a fitting way to mark the millennium—a free hom age to the unifying force of art. Ownership of antiquities in the pos session of major museums was being contested by nations eager to reclaim objects long removed from their soil. In 2005 the Getty Museum in Los Angeles agreed to return to Italy an urn painted with the Rape of Europa in the fourth century BC. A year later the Metropolitan Museum agreed to send back to Sicily a 2,500-year-old vase painted by the Greek artist Euphronios and a set of Hellenistic silver. A funeral wreath of golden leaves and jeweled flowers, whose extravagant and delicate froth had delighted me, was no longer in its case at the Getty Museum—that, too, an apparent theft now returned to its Aegean home. I read the translation of the Iliad by Robert Fagles; it was stirring in the freshness of its thrilling immortality and earthly particularity, and I remembered that my life, too, had been seeded by that land scape of mountains and sea, in that particular bit of earth and its past. As I attended to the international arguments and controversy over its recovered objects, I wanted to step through them into my own con versation with the place my short past shared with the long one, into the distance where that evocative wreath and those lovely contested carvings had been made. With the man who had since become companion to all my travels I was returning to Athens. Much of my once-veiled future was now itself the past, veiled in its turn by the tricks of memory; I was about to uncover one particular moment, to see how it would live in me now. That return was the beginning of a story in which my modern travels to the places of the ancient world became part of a double journey into the lengthy, fertile, and controversial life of classical antiquity. We arrived at night, and when I opened the shutters of the rooms 131</page><page sequence="4">The Kenyon Review we'd rented for the month, there above me was the high city, the Acropolis lighted so its ancient structures and the long wall fortified with scavenged column drums glowed in the dark distance above the vague trees and jumbled blocks of nearby houses. My luggage had been lost somewhere in the impenetrable Alitalia baggage system, but in the morning, waking late and wearing my traveling companion's T-shirt, I saw on the eastern parapet the small, silhouetted figures of other pilgrims, leaning toward the distant hills. That stony, scarred rock and its tree-fringed base was now our constant view: to the west, the gateway of the Propylea, on the east that parapet (actually a belvedere put up in the nineteenth century), in between the north porch of the Erechtheion and an upper corner of the Parthenon. It was not a view to weary of, although at midday I closed the shutters to keep out the sun. We went out into the city among the tourists and the mopeds, the shopkeepers and endlessly inviting taverna waiters, the fish-sellers in the market with their feet covered by plastic bags to keep them dry, the laconic woman selling pistachios at Monastiraki, the fancy shops in Kolonaki, the construc tion hoarding, taxi drivers, street musicians. We rode the new metro and walked past the turtle pond in the National Gardens. It was several days before I finally walked up through the sloping and stepped streets of the Plaka neighborhood, climbing above the ancient agora to intersect with the route of the annual Panathenaean procession in the time of Pericles. Then I was there. It was, of course, not at all as it had been for Pericles, or for Elgin's agent, the Reverend Philip Hunt, when he began his arrangements to remove the Parthenon's neglected ornamentation, or even for visitors a century later. Early travelers' photographs of the Propylea show broken steps and little trackways beaten around the treacherous rubble, an entrance leading in disordered grandeur to the first view of Athena's temple. Even my own vague recollections of a hot, dusty trail up to a make shift wooden entry kiosk were confounded. Now there was a kind of marble pedestrian boulevard, with a high fence and signs directing the flow of movement, ticket booths, snack vendors, postcard and souvenir kiosks, a small gift shop. My expensive ticket was printed with a colored representation of the Parthenon and trailed a set of five additional tickets for free entry to other (less spectacular) sites in the city below. The current entrance through the Propylea was now a 132</page><page sequence="5">Patricia Vigderman firmly built set of wooden steps, with a handrail and signs in two alphabets warning visitors not to touch the marble. Most surprising, though, was that the Parthenon, indeed the whole Acropolis, appeared as an immense jumble of construction near and far, a serious work zone of scaffolding and stacked marble ancient and contemporary. For over two decades, it turned out, a massive project to study and repair the damage caused by earlier res torations and later atmospheric pollution had been under way. Just here now I was in the midst of a vast, ongoing effort to re-create the masterpiece of fifth-century Athens, a heroic intention not to repeat the restoration mistakes of the recent past, and to be worthy of that much longer past. Careful measuring and recording of the original geometry and sculptural forms of the Parthenon had been under taken. Material that lay scattered on the ground had been gathered up, and blocks once in storage were brought out and properly located. Damaged pieces of marble on the structures were numbered and then dismantled so that new marble could be fitted to the broken surfaces of the ancient blocks. And all of this work was carefully docu mented—every last piece of stone with its own descriptive inventory card. A tourist publication I found later informed readers that "for the following ten years the Acropolis will give the impression of being a huge building site, with the monuments partly disassembled, scaf folding everywhere, machines and workmen, presenting a picture doubtless similar to that obtaining in the age of Pericles when the unique architectural complex was created." Doubtless, I thought, appreciating the stunning display of contemporary will, ingenuity, and commitment, along with the quarter century that had almost passed since that upbeat forecast, and the likelihood that some of the current workers and their ministerial supervisors had been children when the project began. I also thought some of them and probably I myself would not live to see it completed. (A more recent and less romantic explanation of the ongoing works, published in 2002, omits the ten-year time frame, describes the mechanical, chemical, and bio logical damage to be reversed, and chronicles the interventions as a series of several multiyear stages.) As I emerged now from the entranceway, however, the sight of the immense temple, even swathed as it was in construction material and 133</page><page sequence="6">The Kenyon Review roped off from close approach, was overwhelming. The thing was so very big, its two levels of steps up to the western porch, the columns holding what's left of the pediment, and the shadows along that bro ken triangle. No photograph, no drawing can convey the size, the dif ference between one's own distance from the earth and that of a Doric capital. I wandered along the north side of the Parthenon past the Erechtheion, my by-now intimate neighbor, and looked down from the high wall toward our apartment, its shuttered windows half hid den by drooping greenery. The sprawl of the modern city lay all below, climbing as far as it could up the distant hills. How oddly peaceful it was to walk among the ruins, despite the fat yellow sacks of gravel lined up against the south side of the Parthenon beside a series of rough sheds and a small rail line. It was near sunset and the light became golden and dramatic on the pink and beige and white marble underfoot and all around. Water from the previous night's downpour lay in big puddles and reflected the sky, now clear blue. Yes, this was a work site, but the southwestward views toward the port of Piraeus were spectacular. This late there were no construction workers here, and soon the guards, too, were eager to be off—their workday at last done. Time to go, please, closing, time to stop photographing a cat lying on a column drum, or the corner of the pediment against the sky, or your girlfriend with her hair fluttering in the evening breeze. Don't slip on the ruts, don't step in the pool of rainwater, don't linger on the way down. A man outside the gate was offering ten postcards for one euro—a bargain, a last opportunity, his day also finished. Coming slowly through the Propylea one bright early morning a week or so later, through the heavy, untouchable marble and airy scaf folding—solid and transparent forms merging into a work site—I listened to a hammer tapping on stone high above me. Where the temple of Athena Nike would one day reappear, little canvas sheds had been erected, and a man in a red jacket and white cap was mea suring a block of stone with a caliper. Then came the whine of a power saw, and I thought of Lord Elgin's men two centuries earlier, sawing off the backs of the decorative blocks of the frieze to lighten them for transport. More and more workers became evident: someone mea suring a column base, two women in jeans making their way along 134</page><page sequence="7">Patricia Vigderman the scaffolding, men shoveling gravel over by the makeshift elevator on the north face of the rock, a woman on a cell phone inside the Erechtheion. On the Parthenon itself workers in overalls stood among the columns, beside the iron machinery, talking, gesturing, smoking. A guide was informing her group that in the fifth century BC all the blocks of marble had to be carved elsewhere before being brought up to the Acropolis, as it was a sacred place, not a workshop. She said this with great conviction, although in the little museum half submerged into the citadel rock just behind the Parthenon there was signage beside the frieze itself saying it was probably sculpted right on the building between 442 and 436 BC. In that little nineteenth-century museum (expanded once in the 1950s) visitors circulated past selections from the marble and bronze objects buried by the Athenians after the Persians had sacked their earlier, unfinished temple toward the triumphant fifth-century achievements near the exit. On that October Monday the crowds wishing to step close to the past paused to be informed or misin formed by their guides, to inspect an archaic kouros with a calf across his shoulders or a kore offering a pomegranate, to photograph, look, and move on. "No flash, please!" cried the guards over and over. The scattered fragments of information were a hasty analog to the frag mentation of the works. It's like a puzzle, one guide said, to piece the different accounts together into a story. It was the people looking, though, who seemed to me the puz zle—the scatter and press of unmatched languages, of sandals and sneakers, plaids and denim, T-shirts proclaiming affiliations with rock bands, motorcycle brands, and sports teams, or levels of aggres sive sexuality. Cameras of all sizes, old people staggering through on canes, bored teenagers with spiked hair staring at the floor. People came here tanned from their time on the beautiful islands, fresh from the glittering blue of the sea. They selected which archaic maiden to be photographed in front of; they consulted their guidebooks. They stared, bringing their own battered faces before the relics of the so-far past, or their sloppy and beautiful youth. A discontinuity of humanity offered its jagged edges to the art on display. Beside a circle of strange and lovely archaic maidens a group idled while the guide informed them that the enigmatic smiles on the faces of these kores were all sculpted to formula, as were their identical 135</page><page sequence="8">The Kenyon Review poses: the folded drapery, the offered fruit in one hand. "No imagina tion," she concluded, dismissing the predictable posture, eager to move her charges on toward the parts of the Parthenon frieze Elgin's men had not taken: the energetic fragments of the chariot competi tion, the wild manes of the horses, the flowing streamers on the hel mets, the power of a victorious city. What had drawn this group together here to reach for these scraps of the past, this disordered flourish in the face of death? It was a relief to step out of the little museum, to be surrounded by the ordinary sky, the intermittent sounds of construction, the city stretching to the hills, the uneven marble underfoot, the broken teeth of the wall, the broken facade of the temple, the scrappy trees, the snoozing dogs. I stood looking over the edge of the citadel, toward Mount Lycabettus, where the previous night we'd watched the sun set, and then the moon emerge formulaic and orange as it must have done just so in archaic times; like the kores, predictable, extraordi nary, continuous. Those kores, I thought, arrested imagination in a moment continually offered, like the pomegranates in their hands, like the rising moon, fitting together the jagged edges of discontinu ous time and passing generations. But the vulnerability of the past to misinformation is inescapable, like the mistakes in a printed manu script. The present reads hastily, skipping to the best parts, highlight ing the sunny days. The Athens I'd returned to now had slower, wetter days, days that revealed a present both jagged and perplexing. The next time we went to the Acropolis it was again evening, the end of a very wet day, unsea sonable and requiring some determination against disappointment, as well as the use of an umbrella. The walk through the streets toward the southern entrance was interrupted by such a torrent that we'd had to stop under an awning by a shop window near the intersection of Byron and Shelley streets, where to our surprise the display seemed to be entirely of pigs: small figurines of anthropomorphic pigs engaged in sexual activity. They were crude representations: a dominatrix pig in black stockings, a threeway with two sows, the smiling bestiality of farm animals in unloosed overalls. What was this place, where the city streets below the Acropolis were often clumsy passages involving broken pieces of cement, half finished walls, black rubber hoses with chopped-off ends underfoot? 136</page><page sequence="9">Patricia Vigderman Athens like crumbled eggshells beneath . . . What was I supposed to make of the interminable reconstruction in progress above, of the unremitting progression of the new city into the distance, mounting the hills, sprawling greedily over the landscape and toward the shin ing harbor in the distance? The pigs in the shop window. Across from the spare columns of Hadrian's library, tourist para phernalia flapped from the open fronts of shops. Meanwhile, on the citadel above, the systematic effort to restore what remains of the dis tant past, and to undo the mistakes of the near past, was creating an even more radical hybrid with the present. The process of recovery and reclamation that had made the Acropolis into a construction site for over three decades is a tour de force of modern science and labor, a massive partnership with the past. We know so much more than they did, but as T. S. Eliot says, "they are that which we know." Shortly before we left Athens, I tagged along with an English jour nalist on her tour of another construction site, the visionary and almost finished new museum in process just below the southern wall of the Acropolis. The little underground museum above, on the rock itself, was much too small to do justice to the extensive collection of artifacts excavated from the site, most of which had been in storage for decades, if not centuries. There was also the question of where Elgin's marbles might be displayed should they ever be returned to Athens. Since the 1990s a project to create a fitting museum counter part to the Acropolis itself had been under way, despite various set backs and through several design competitions. By the time of my visit, in 2006, that project was taking definite shape, and workers from all over Europe were hurrying to complete a showcase perhaps pow erful enough to draw back to Athens the missing marbles. On the still raw lobby level, the director of this great and hopeful project pointed out the future location of a glass-floored café, where, he said, people would be able to drink coffee while looking down at the remains of an ancient urban landscape: traces of twelve centuries of human activity—workshops, houses, jugs and vases, kitchen implements, toys, votive figures—that had been discovered when the excavations for the new museum were started. The houses and streets from Roman times, the urban foundations of that thriving world, had then been incorporated into the architectural design as the museum's 137</page><page sequence="10">The Kenyon Review visible understory: an initial layer of retrieved memory, the long-ago life of this place. We passed large puddles and orange plastic fencing, temporary stairways, and small front-loaders as we made our way toward the highest level through the light falling from the top and sides of the building. Immense glass windows made by the French manufactory that had produced the mirrors of Versailles were being set in place around the top floor where, in the very center, a rectangular module with the same dimensions as the Parthenon's interior chamber had been constructed. On its outer walls, within this glass-sided space—with its unimpeded views of the Acropolis, of the surround ing hills, of sky and city—might be displayed the entire reunited frieze, the procession and the seated gods whole. To this end the enor mous module had been built with open spaces, empty windows into which would be fitted the pieces of the frieze still in Athens. The pres ence of those windows on the blank wall offered silent testimony now to a long-ago violence: the blocks still in Athens, still whole, would need more depth than the ones sawn flat by Elgin's men to lighten them. Should the British government decide to return what was now in their possession, the returned blocks could be set in place flat on the wall beside the blocks already set and waiting. And at last the pro cession could once again be installed facing outward, as it had been on the temple itself. In full sight of the Parthenon then, in the natural light of the Aegean, visitors would be able to walk the length of the ancient pro cession, proceeding toward the waiting gods. The steel columns sup porting the roof, explained our fluent and hospitable host as we stood there in our white hard hats, were spaced to match the outer peristyle of the Parthenon—an abstract simulation, he said, of the rhythms of archaic atmosphere. When the remaining metopes were hung between these columns, surrounding the inner movement of the frieze, the great symbol of Western civilization would at last be seen in its origi nal configuration, and its original light. The frieze, he said, was the first Greek representation of men on a plane with gods. It shows the Athenians, with their horses and chari ots, their lowing heifers, muscular athletes, reverent maidens, approaching the gods, coming face to face as one must finally in seri ous worship. Like the donors kneeling in a Renaissance painting, 138</page><page sequence="11">Patricia Vigderman however, it also shows the citizens of fifth-century Athens crossing into the world formerly reserved for immortals. To this great city Athena had granted powers that allowed its citizens a new relation ship with the natural world, awakening formerly unimaginable human possibility. This new museum as well was a kind of demonstration of Athena's continuing influence, a powerful replacement for the much humbler museum on the Acropolis, where there had been so little encourage ment to linger. I saw that this grand new museum would not be sur rounded by ordinary sky and snoozing dogs; its view of the Parthenon will be offered through dazzlingly engineered plate glass. In its gener ous spaces visitors will ascend to wander freely among objects at last released from storage. It was to be an architectural invitation to make whole a shared heritage, a grand dream of a golden age when gods were indeed claimed for this place through the union of the natural and the man-made, through the wild energy of stone horses and indi vidualized men. When the restorations on the citadel are complete, however, dem onstrating that the soul and destiny of ancient Athens are autochtho nous, are of and in this place, this museum now situated at its foot will also be here to remind us of our belatedness. The temple will sail on, a shining monument in the distance, while at hand the marble images from the distant past will parade around the exact dimensions of the interior cella, a stilled carousel of retrieved fragments and miss ing links. Whether the marbles from London are reinstalled, or their places held by plaster casts, the story will be of imagination and ineluctable change, of triumph and loss. When our time in Athens was over, I closed the windows that looked up at the north porch of the Erechtheion for the last time, and we flew to London. At the British Museum, the man in charge of international relations bought me a cup of tea and talked to me for an hour about his museum's intentions regarding the Parthenon mar bles. Later I found on the Web an official reiteration of some of his conversation, but not, of course, of the passionate and fluent delivery. The museum, he explained, was not an art museum (like the Getty in Los Angeles, he meant, or the Metropolitan in New York). It was a museum of culture. He spoke intensely and at length about its recent 139</page><page sequence="12">The Kenyon Review relationship with Africa, and with a museum in Kenya. He spoke of his own new understanding of the importance of Africa in human history. His theme was an antinationalism, a "new sense of Britishness," a common culture. He imagined London (or reimagined London) as it had been during the Enlightenment—the world's greatest city. I understood there was a connection between the importance of Africa in human history and that of the British Museum, which was meant for the whole world, and was now part of a perception of what it meant to be British that arose from the country's proliferating multi culturalism. Their holdings were not there simply to make it a place where people came; the intention was to take the collections on the road, to lend the wonderful things, and to lend their expertise. He made a gesture with his hands of moving outward. I told him about my visit to the prospective new museum in Athens and mentioned the idea of a curatorial partnership for the contested marbles. He said with a polite sort of indignation that you don't lend things to people who don't recognize your right of owner ship, and I had to admit that would be foolish. He expanded: the point of the British Museum was not simply the free access it offered to people from all over the world—that was an admirable, but crude purpose, he explained. What we were sur rounded by in this soaring Great Hall were things that had the poten tial to change people's view of themselves and others—to see them selves as part of a global citizenship. What this museum of culture was doing was "lengthening the context of human history." That was why Africa was so important. I sat mesmerized, drinking my tea, while he developed these themes. The classical age embodied in the marbles and pointed to with such pride and longing by the Greeks (and the Italians, for that matter) was simply the old lure of a golden age, he said, a construct, not to be taken fundamentally (like Eden in the Bible? I wondered). It needed contextualizing, not enshrining, as was the plan in Athens. Here in London, in its specially built gallery, that classical world, that carved stone, was one great attraction among many. Thus also the Rosetta Stone, I supposed he meant, which you have to pass by to get to the marbles, and thus also the special events taking place just that week celebrating Bengali culture, or the later ones scheduled on American jazz or ancient Assyria. 140</page><page sequence="13">Patricia Vigderman I mentioned the simple oddity of the historical scattering, what Christopher Hitchens has called the "torn canvas" of the frieze, and the possibility that reuniting its parts might have some advantages: putting together heads and bodies, horses and chariots, gods and men. (The Parthenon sculpture is like a marvelous canvas arbitrarily torn across, with its depth and perspective and proportion summarily abolished," says Hitchens.) He seemed to be talking very fast now, as he pointed out that the marbles were and always would be frag ments—supreme examples, not a whole. He reiterated the point about the deceptive allure of classicism. The marbles are not as impor tant as the Greeks think they are, he said, neither culturally nor artis tically unique, not qualitatively different from stuff in other muse ums. Indeed, he said, the diasporic nature of classical Greek identity is shown by the Parthenon marbles. To call an identity diasporic is to acknowledge its continuing fer tility. A word like autochthony arrives with the rooted thump of authority, but diaspora has the singing sound of movement; it's a song of scattering, from a Greek root (speirein) that means to sow. It's a dif ferent kind of power. What were the seeds, I wondered, that had fallen on him, and how had they come to connect him to the issue now? Naturally we had Googled each other before meeting, so I knew his particular interest was or at least had been Roman coins, an interest ing conjunction of the golden age and gold itself, the lure of classi cism and the practicalities of daily life. He told me he had, in fact, had an early passion for Roman history, and (like Lord Elgin) had been trained in the classics. He'd been good at the ancient languages, had fallen under their golden spell. Now, however, he was a convert. Being at the museum had made him more globally aware. It had changed his feelings for ancient Rome into a sense of its being just one among many cultures. How many cultures, I was thinking by this time, can we connect to? How much imagination can we bring to bear on the enormous length of human history? Don't we have to fall in love with a particu lar past, with particular lost worlds? But these questions were still inchoate, and I kept them to myself. In any case, the pride he was now showing in the museum's col lecting and lending was based on its own uniqueness, its qualitative difference—the only place so comprehensive and open. Right here in 141</page><page sequence="14">The Kenyon Review Bloomsbury were the inheritors of the Enlightenment, keeping the flame alive, the golden age of coffeehouses and ferocious wit. Keeping alive the light of curiosity about ourselves and others: the world. A bulwark against identity politics, narrow nationalism, and careless despoliation. It's a universal museum, a museum of culture, not an art museum. When he had gone off to his lunch appointment, after mutual assurances of exchanged pleasure and the hope of a future meeting in which I might be the lunch appointment, I sat for a while at the slightly uncomfortable table, contemplating my now cold tea and his conviction that the marbles were doing more good here than they would in Athens. The actual nature of them is to be broken, seemed to be the lesson. Their brokenness is not something that can be mended. I thought of the sculptor Antonio Canova's spin on this point when Lord Elgin had consulted him about restoration: lamen table that the work of the ablest artists the world had ever seen should have suffered so much from time and barbarism, but that was their reality. Obviously Canova's sense of time and barbarism was not quite what was meant in this case, but it may also be true that part of the pleasure, the thrill the marbles offer as expression of a golden van ished past, includes their diasporic splitness. It's lamentable that his tory is what it is, but the brokenness now folds into the marbles a cultural tug of war between national pride and historical imperialism, an intervening story that brings them closer, filling in the long blank between them and us. The current argument over their location sharpens their effect. They're not just important old stones, but stones to fight for, stones with meaning right now. Stones around which we enact moral dramas, take passionate stands, exercise our divine intel lects. Just like the ancient Greeks! The new museum taking shape in Athens was a glorious produc tion—a modern palace with glass walls dazzling as the mirrors of Versailles. A construction pitched right above the remains of a settle ment that lasted twelve hundred years and then vanished until this moment, our time. At once a powerful visual statement of missing ness and a thrilling reminder of what is not missing: a glorious van tage on the Parthenon itself and on the modern city where the ancient alphabet is still used and the ancient language persists. 142</page><page sequence="15">Patricia Vigderman Maybe fragmentation and loss are the real power, the real ground of imaginative connection. A painting by Vermeer or a Nok sculpture is a fragment of a vanished world, an invitation to know the beauty in our own fragmentedness and impermanence. Sailing, though still all these ages. Athens, London, so too are cities clusters of the pieces that remain. Like memory itself, historical narrative casts a flickering light over decay and reconstruction, over the places and objects of the present. What indeed makes the past emerge more fruitful and lively in one place than another? Questions of what we owe to the past and what we want of it have led me to literary and historical encounters with the continuing life of the fragmented past and to further explorations on the ground—to temples built to establish Magna Graecia far from Athens. A disloca tion of being at once out of place as well as out of time, the labor and pleasure of having a relationship with the remains of the classical world, became as well a meditation on the temporality of a single life. My double journey became a foray into the irresistible decay, in Walter Benjamin's evocative phrase, with which ancient objects confront and engage the present. In exploring the terrain of the ancient world, I've found that time keeps folding past and present over each other, constantly nudging me into digressions—on plunder and empire, on specific stories of longing and disaffection for the past, and on my own immediate plea sure and surprise. These fertile and unstable meetings with history and aesthetics are now site and framework for imagining and under standing the real life of the Parthenon, its robust and evanescent exis tence within my own insight and blindness. 143</page></plain_text>
