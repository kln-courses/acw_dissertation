Yet there are few systematic studies of apology as a dependent variable. Analyzing the last statements of Texas death row prisoners, we find that the best predictor of apology is affiliation with God. Under traditional Western conceptions, God is an actor endowed with extraordinarily high status. Drawing on the theoreti cal paradigm known as pure sociology, we argue that death row prisoners who invoke God as a third party in their conflict thereby elevate their own status. Greater vertical closeness to the victim's side gen erates more social assertiveness and a greater willingness to apologize publicly. In addition, affiliation increases prisoners' relational closeness to God, enhancing their probability of adopting God's modern message of reconciliation. God's status has, however, declined somewhat over the past several centuries —a trend that helps to explain the modern religious emphasis on reconciliation over punishment, apology over defiance. KEY WORDS: apologies; arbitration; conflict management; crime; pure sociology; religion. INTRODUCTION Conflict is a universal human experience (Black, 2011). Yet the response to conflict—conflict management—is highly variable, ranging from genocide (Campbell, 2009, 2010), lynching (Senechal de la Roche, 1996), and suicide (Manning, 2012) at one end of the spectrum to therapy (Tucker, 1999), avoid ance, and toleration at the other end (Baumgartner, 1988). A mode of conflict management that appears to be growing in importance across many spheres of life is apology (Lazarre, 2004). Examples include countries apologizing for past discrimination against their own citizens and for wars against other nations, churches for sexual abuse by clergy, corporations for manufacturing or selling dangerous products, celebrities for extra-marital affairs, and criminals for crime (Cunningham, 1999; Nobles, 2008: 155-166; Strang, 2002). Regardless of whether apology is more frequent or just more fully reported today, its ' For providing comments on earlier versions of the paper, we thank Karen Albright, Donald Black, Paul Colomy, Barry Schwartz, David Smilde, and the anonymous reviewers. ~ University of Georgia, 208 Baldwin Hall, Athens, Georgia 30602; e-mail: mcooney(a:uga.edu. 3 Department of Sociology and Criminology, University of Denver, 2000 East Asbury Avenue, 159 © 2013 Eastern Sociological Society</page><page sequence="2">160 Cooney and Phillips increasing prominence belies a lack of systematic data on the topic. One weak ness of the available information stands out in particular: While instances of apology are relatively easy to document, instances of nonapology are consider ably less so. All actors have occasion to apologize at some point. But they do not always do so. How often do countries, churches, corporations, celebrities, criminals, and others fail to apologized And what distinguishes those cases in which they issue an apology from those in which they withhold one? Without information on apology and nonapology for the same transgression, our ability to develop and test a theory of apology will remain severely limited. We present data on both apologies and their absence following conviction for the most legally serious crime in the modern world: intentional homicide. In par ticular, we analyze the last statements of all individuals executed for capital mur der in Texas during 2000-2010. Drawing on the same data as the current research, Eaton and Theuer (2009) examined whether death row prisoners in Texas apolo gized to the victim's side. They suggest that the strongest predictors of apology are whether the prisoner asks for forgiveness from the victim's family, takes responsi bility for the crime, shows empathy to the victim's family, and seems sincere. Although Eaton and Theuer's argument is not technically tautological, there is lit tle daylight between the predictors and the outcome; the predictors are arguably bound up in the nature of an apology. We propose a very different relationship: Apology is influenced by the prisoners' affiliation with a third party of singularly high status: God. In brief, we propose that affiliation with God enhances a death row prisoner's social status, rendering the parties to the conflict more equal; social status engenders social assertiveness, enabling an expression of regret. APOLOGY Few moral actions have the power of apology. An apology "does not and cannot undo what has been done," yet often has "almost miraculous qualities" (Tavuchis, 1991: 5-6; emphasis in original). Apology can turn a conflict in a wholly new direction, deflecting it from the path of vengeance onto the road of reconciliation. It can provide satisfaction, partial or full, to the aggrieved party, even without any exchange of material resources. In some cases, it can even heal long-standing and bitter enmities.4 Not surprisingly, then, apology has attracted considerable attention from a variety of disciplines. The Literature Saying "I'm sorry" may appear to be a straightforward statement, yet apology turns out to harbor considerable complexities, as analyses by 4 The apparently miraculous quality of apology seems to stem from its ability to halt the deepening division of the two sides and restore amicable relationships. Apology thus represents what Black (2011) might term a sharp reversal of moral time.</page><page sequence="3">with God on One s Side 01 sociologists, lawyers, social psychologists, political scientists, physicians, and Dthers demonstrate. To apologize is to criticize the self. But to apologize is also :o acknowledge the injury done to the other party directly and thereby to nudge :he relationship toward its previous state, which includes shared standards of right and wrong. A complete apology has several components, including admis sion of wrongdoing, acceptance of responsibility, expression of remorse, and a promise not to repeat (Smith, 2008). Not all apologies are complete. Some do not admit wrongdoing ("I am sorry if anybody took offense"). Others are mere expressions of remorse ("I am sorry you were hurt"). And still others, whether :omplete or partial, are issued by or to groups, sometimes for misdeeds long past, raising the issue of who is competent to give or receive them (Trouillot, 2000). In the empirical literature, apology is typically treated as an independent variable. Political scientists, legal scholars, social psychologists, and others have iddressed the effect of apologies on interstate, legal, and interpersonal conflict respectively (see, e.g., Fehr et al., 2010, Nobles, 2008; Robbennolt, 2003: 482—501, 2006). Important though this focus is, it leaves open the equally signifi ant prior question: Under what conditions do apologies occur? Few systematic studies have addressed the social predictors of apology. Exline et al. (2007) found that respondents recalled more apologies in, for instance, close relation ships, for unintentional offenses, and when the victim sought an apology. As mentioned previously, Eaton and Theuer (2009) examined whether death row prisoners in Texas apologized to the victim's side, but their independent and dependent variables are cut from the same cloth. Pushing the inquiry in a new direction, we examine the impact of third parties on apology. Third Parties Third parties consist of all those who know of a conflict other than the principal parties (Black, 1993b: 126). They are often extremely fateful to the trajectory and outcome of conflicts of all types and at all structural levels— interpersonal, inter-organizational, and international. Theorizing about third parties is not the province of any one intellectual tradition. Rational choice the orists have addressed the role and impact of third parties (see, e.g., Tedeschi and Felson, 1994). Other perspectives such as strain and social learning theory could easily be extended to shed light on third-party behavior. But one theoreti cal perspective has devoted considerably more attention to third parties than any other: pure sociology. A body of pure sociology theory addresses a broad variety of third-party behavior, including fighting among young men, witness behavior in legal cases, informal mediation in tribal and modern societies, cross-cultural variation in spousal assault, and participation in rioting, lynch ing, and other forms of collective violence (Baumgartner, 1993; Black, 1993a, 1993b; Cooney, 1994, 1998; Phillips and Cooney, 2005; Senechal de la Roche, 2001).</page><page sequence="4">162 Cooney and Phillips Pure Sociology Developed by Donald Black (1976, 1995, 2000), pure sociology explains behavior with its location and direction in social space—its social structure or geometry. In murder cases, for instance, the pure sociologist asks: Is the killing upward (committed by a lower status person against a higher status one) or down ward? Is it close (e.g., between intimates) or distant (e.g., between strangers)? Do third parties widen the case structure or narrow it? Do third parties elevate one side over the other? The answers to these questions predict the outcome of the case—the punishment, if any, imposed on the offender (Cooney, 2009). Third parties are of two main types: partisans, who enter conflicts on one side, and settlement agents, who enter them neutrally (Black, 1993b: 139). In legal cases, lawyers and witnesses are typically partisans, while judges and jurors are settlement agents. Some third parties are both: police officers often start off judging the merits of disputes and then act as partisans (witnesses for the prose cution) at later stages of the case. Third parties vary geometrically in several ways, including their social status relative to that of the principals. Social status in pure sociology is mul tidimensional, referring to differences in wealth, organization, integration, culture, and moral standing. Thus, superior partisans are, for example, more affluent, more powerful, or more morally respectable while inferior partisans are lower than the principals on one or more of these dimensions of social status. All else the same, superior partisans are more influential than inferior ones, and the greater their superiority, the more they impact the dynamics of a conflict (Black, 1993b: 127). They do so in part by lifting the status of those they come to support. Having a high status lawyer work on behalf of an indigent client boosts the status of the client's side and improves his or her chance of a favor able outcome (Black, 1989: 13-14). God has traditionally been conceived anthropomorphically, though endowed with extraordinary agentic powers—as the single and supreme ruler of the cosmos and the source of all that is good (see, e.g.. Stark, 2001).5 This is par ticularly true in the Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam— that dominate many regions of the world, including North America. In this con ception, God is the highest status actor in the universe. To have God on one's side therefore elevates one's own position in social space, particularly in moral space. One might be the lowest of the low in the eyes of humankind—a prisoner on death row, for example—but God's support means that one is nonetheless valued, respected, and not beyond redemption (see, e.g., Kusha, 2009; Pickett, 2002). And the more God's support for one is acknowledged by others, the more moral status one has.6 5 Not all peoples conceive of God (or gods) as a superior being willing or able to intervene in human affairs. Why conceptions of God vary so widely has yet to be fully explained (see, e.g., Collins, 1992: 30-59; Durkheim. 2001; Stark and Bainbridge, 1987). 6 Conversely, the more God's support is contested, the less socially useful God is. If one's God is rid iculed or reviled, for instance, one's status will be reduced rather than increased.</page><page sequence="5">With God on One's Side 163 God typically enters conflicts at the request of one or both principals through a particular form of social interaction: prayer (see Cerulo and Barra, 2008). As Black (1995: 860, note 149) observes, Praying to God is analogous to calling the police, especially when God is asked to provide help: the prayer increases God's involvement in a particular location and direction in social space—both where the prayer itself occurs and where He is asked to intervene (such as against a particular person who has allegedly victimized another person in a specific location and direction in social space). To the extent that a prisoner's affiliation with God is publicly proclaimed and accepted, the enhanced status that ensues tends to alter his or her behavior in several ways. One is a greater willingness to engage with adversaries (Black, 1976: 21-24). While those at the bottom of the social hierarchy are often rendered mute when faced with their social superiors (e.g., subject-monarch), actors who are affiliated with a highly placed third party are apt to be more assertive. Moreover, with greater equality between adversaries comes an increased probability of conciliation (Black, 1976: 30). Social control from below tends to be penal in nature (Baumgartner, 1984). As social inferiors become more equal—either because their own status increases or they attract high status third parties, such as God—reconciliation becomes more common. Since apol ogy is a type of reconciliation, it should become more likely (and nonapology less likely) as the parties equalize. The overall relationship between equality and voluntary, or unsolicited, apology therefore appears to be curvilinear: apologies are more likely for lateral offenses (among equals) than for upward offenses (against status superiors) or downward offenses (against status inferiors). Moreover, the greater the status superiority or inferiority (vertical distance) of the offenders' side (principals and partisans), the less likely apologies are. Thus, highly superior offenders (mon archs, dictators) rarely apologize to those below them.7 Only when their status decreases or that of the offended party increases do they become more likely to apologize.8 Likewise, highly inferior offenders appear to have low rates of unso licited apology. When inferiors apologize, it is often because they are compelled to do so (e.g., a younger child being required to apologize by a parent to an older sibling; a slave accused of striking his master apologetically begging for his life). But as offenders become more equal to their victims, they become more likely to issue free and unforced apologies. A death row prisoner whose status has been elevated through an affiliation with God ought therefore to be more likely to exhibit the social assertiveness required to express remorse to the vic tim's family publicly than a prisoner not so affiliated. 7 Robert Mugabe, for example, appears to have no intention of apologizing for the torture and kill ing of several thousand Zimbabwean citizens in the 1980s while he was Prime Minister (http:// www.nytimes.com/2011 /0 l/24/world/africa/24zimbabwe.html?emc = eta 1 ). 8 The increased status of African Americans, for instance, has resulted in several official apologies for slavery, including one from the U.S. Congress in 2009 (see http://thedailyvoice.com/voice/2009/ 06/congress-apologizes-for-slaver-002021 .php). We expect that as the social status of victims rises, they become more assertive in requesting apologies.</page><page sequence="6">164 Cooney and Phillips Our theoretical argument can be summarized as follows: Affiliation with God enhances the social status of a death row prisoner, reducing the vertical dis tance between the offender and the victim's side; enhanced social status imbues the prisoner with the social assertiveness needed to apologize. God and Deviance Pure sociology predicts that an offender's affiliation with God increases the chance of apology, but so too does the criminological literature on religion and crime. In a well-known paper, Hirschi and Stark (1969) argued, against the grain of much expectation, that religious commitment among youth was not negatively related to delinquent behavior. Other scholars remained uncon vinced, however, and a series of studies gradually accumulated that cast doubt on Hirschi and Stark's thesis. Surveys of the literature find that the great bulk of studies report a negative relationship between religiosity and criminal behavior. The most comprehensive review analyzed 270 studies published between 1940 and 2010 employing a wide variety of research methods, populations, sample sizes, and measures of religion (religious beliefs and practices, denomination, religiosity, participation in a religious program, etc.). The results "confirm that the vast majority of the studies report prosocial effects of religion and religious involvement on various measures of crime and delinquency" (Johnson and Jang, 2010: 120).9 Criminological research on religion and crime has not specifically addressed the role of apology. But the extension is a natural one. As Johnson and Jang (2010: 129) state in the conclusion of their review of the research findings, The beneficial relationship between religion and crime is not simply a function of religion's constraining function or what it discourages—opposing drug use, violence, or delinquent behavior—but also through what it encourages—promoting prosocial behaviors. If it is accepted that apology is a prosocial behavior, then criminological theory, like pure sociology, predicts that an affiliation with God increases the probabil ity that a death row prisoner will apologize to the family of the victim. Do the data support this prediction? METHODS Cases Drawing on data from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) website (http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/stat/dr_executed_offenders.html), our sample 9 Why religion inhibits crime and deviance is less clear. The empirical findings are consistent with all of the major theories of criminality—control, deterrence, social learning and strain (Akers, 2010). Yet none of these theories fully explains the effects (Johnson and Jang, 2010).</page><page sequence="7">With God on One s Side 165 includes last statements from the 265 prisoners executed in Texas from 2000 to 2010. However, we exclude the 33 prisoners who claimed to be innocent during their last statement and therefore had no reason to apologize, reducing the final sample to 232 prisoners (all men).10 To supplement the information available on the TDCJ website, we consulted two additional sources: the Texas Execution Information Center website (http://txexecutions.org/default.asp; includes a detailed description of each case) and the Clark County Prosecutor website (http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/usexecute.htm; includes a detailed description of each case and information on the offender and victim's race, age, gender, and relationship). We chose the period from 2000 to 2010 for three reasons: (1) the TDCJ website includes last statements for all the prisoners executed from 2000 to 2010, but is missing last statements from 46 of the prisoners executed from 1982 to 1999; (2) the supplemental websites do not begin comprehensive coverage of the cases until 2000; (3) last statements were not made in the presence of the victim's family until 1997, meaning the earlier period presented a fundamentally different set of dynamics for apology (Heflick, 2005). Thus, the period from 2000 to 2010 eliminates missing data, facilitates the inclusion of a broader range of control variables, and ensures that the last statements were made under comparable conditions. Social Status, Social Assertiveness, and Apology We propose a mediating relationship: affiliation with God enhances a death row prisoner's social status, providing the social assertiveness needed to apolo gize. Consider the measurement of each component. To measure affiliation with God, we examined whether prisoners referenced the supernatural during their last statements. Of the 105 prisoners who did so, 100 referenced either a Christian conception of God (e.g., "Lord Jesus Christ") or a universal conception ("God"), while 5 referenced an Islamic conception ("Allah"). Thus, we use the narrow term "God" throughout the remainder of the article rather than the cumbersome term "God/Allah" or the even broader term "religion." Prisoners mentioned God in 44 distinct ways. The 10 most common ways (often used in combination) were to recite a verse, song, or prayer (29 instances); say "I am going to Heaven" (29 instances); make a profession of faith (22 instances); ask for forgiveness/mercy from God (21 instances); say "Jesus receive my spirit" (several variations; 19 instances); say "God be with you" or "God bless you" (17 instances); say "Thank God" (12 instances); say "Praise God" (10 instances); say "Hope/pray that God gives the victim's family comfort/peace/ 10 Almost all the last statements were verbal. However, a small number of prisoners offered a written statement (either in addition to or in place of a verbal statement). We treat verbal and written statements as interchangeable.</page><page sequence="8">166 Cooney and Phillips closure" (10 instances); and advise others to turn to God for strength and com fort (8 instances).11 We treat the different ways that prisoners mentioned God as interchange able—mentioning God indicates an affiliation with God. However, we distin guish between the existence and intensity of the affiliation. Specifically, we include two predictors: a dichotomous indicator of whether the prisoner men tioned God (0 = no; 1 = yes) and a count of the number of times the prisoner mentioned God (0, 1, 2, and 3 or more).12 It is important to note that we do not have direct measures of the relative status of the offender and the victim's side. The offender is invariably lower in status, however. Even if the offender and the victim's side were of equally low status at the time of the homicide, the offender's conviction for murder and receipt of a death sentence drastically lowers his moral status and guarantees that apologies travel upward. Because affiliation with God boosts an actor's status, offenders who claim such an affiliation are, on average, less socially infe rior to the victim's side than those who do not. To measure social assertiveness, we examined the number of words in the prisoner's last statement.13 Social assertiveness is arrayed along a continuum, from meek prisoners who did not speak to poised prisoners who were verbose. Specifically, the number of words ranged from 0 to 747, with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 112. In the models that treat social assertiveness as a dependent variable—social status predicts social assertiveness—we use a count of the number of words. In the subsequent models that treat social assertiveness as an independent variable—social assertiveness predicts apology—we use a count of the number of words divided by 100 to produce meaningful unit changes. Finally, to ascertain whether prisoners apologized (0 = no; 1 = yes), we coded the last statements. Most apologies were unambiguous. Yet, even true apologies were not necessarily pure apologies, as prisoners often invoked excuses, which weakened but did not nullify the apology. Consider Yosvanis Valle's apology for killing Jose Junco in a home invasion: I am sorry, i never wanted to kill your family. I never wanted to kill your family or these people. I am sorry for the way I talk in English. I did it to myself. I was forced to do it. I was a gang member. I never wanted to kill your brother. I was forced to do this. I blame 11 Prisoners who made a vague reference to the afterlife—"I will see Mom tonight"—are not counted as mentioning religion (although "I will see Mom tonight in Heaven" would count). 12 In four cases, an inmate who had been speaking in English switched to a different language. Unfortunately, the TDCJ website does not provide the words that were spoken in the different language. Since two of the prisoners in question mentioned God and apologized in English, we know the codes for our focal variables. But the other two prisoners did not mention God or apolo gize in the English portion of the last statement. Here, we assume that they did not do so in another language. However, since such an assumption supports our argument, we reran the mod els without the two questionable cases. The substantive results remained the same. 13 Two caveats. First, the TDCJ website indicated that one inmate simply cursed at the staff. Not knowing how many words were spoken, we assigned the mean number of words (119). Second, since the TDCJ website does not include the words of the small number of prisoners who switched from English to a different language, we cannot count them.</page><page sequence="9">With God on One s Side 167 myself. I am not going to blame nobody. I got my mother and my family too. I was forced. I tell you from my heart. 1 am sorry with all my heart. That's the reality of life, I am sorry. I got to pay for it. To my family, I love you, be strong. They have family too; the way they suffer is the way I am suffering. I am asking you to go and give them hugs. Please accept their hugs. Be strong in the Lord. I love you sister. I love you all, please go and try and talk to the family. I love my family. 1 understand why I am paying this price. Do not have any excuses for not extending your love. I am ready Warden, 1 am sorry everybody, I did it. Thank you brother, don't hate nobody, I feel good. I love my family, I love you Jesus. Be strong mama, I love you sister. 1 love Jesus. Warden I am ready. Other prisoners issued apologies that were succinct, but nonetheless real. Stanley Baker used his last breaths to utter these words: Well, I don't have anything to say. I am just sorry about what I did to Mr. Peters. That's all. Still other prisoners apologized but eschewed full responsibility (Napoleon Beaz ley: "I'm sorry that it was something in me that caused all of this to happen") or declared that all is forgiven (David Gibbs: "I have wronged you and your family and for that I am truly sorry. I forgive and I have been forgiven"). Although self-distancing weakens the apology, the apology was made. In contrast, a small number of prisoners made ambiguous statements that did not rise to a true apology. Robert Salazar, for example, did not actually say that he was sorry for killing Adriana Gomez, the 2-year-old child he was baby sitting. When asked if he wanted to make a last statement, Salazar responded: Yes. Yes, I do. Do I just talk to the front? O.K. To everybody on both sides of that wall— I want you to know I love you. I am sorry that the child had to lose her life, but 1 should not have to be here. Tell my family I love them all and I will see them in Heaven. Come home when you can. I am done. Love you all. We do not count the small number of "pseudo apologies" as apologies, although the substantive findings are the same regardless.14 Because the second author coded the cases, we tested the reliability of our measures by having the first author blind code a random sample of 50 cases. The results were reassuring. Whether the prisoner mentioned God was coded the same in all 50 cases, and the number of times the prisoner mentioned God was coded the same in 38 cases (the remaining 12 cases were within one point on the scale). Whether the prisoner apologized was coded the same in 47 cases. Controls and Modeling Is the proposed relationship spurious? The most obvious potential con founder is antisocial personality (see, e.g., Hare, 1993). Presumably, death row prisoners with severe antisocial personalities are the least likely to affiliate with God and the least likely to apologize (whereas those who are better adjusted are 14 If the inmate apologized, but it was not clear that the apology was directed toward the victim or the victim's side, then the statement was not coded as an apology; if the inmate promised to apolo gize to the victim in the afterlife, then the future intention was coded as an apology.</page><page sequence="10">168 Cooney and Phillips the most likely to affiliate with God and apologize). In the absence of direct evi dence, we constructed a proxy for antisocial personality based on the nature of the capital offense and the offender's prior violent record. Our measure of anti social personality sums the following variables: (1) the number of statutory ag gravators (the following aggravators were present in the cases: robbery, child victim, kidnapping, police victim, multiple victims, rape, remuneration, arson, escape, obstruction/retaliation, and murder committed by an inmate serving a life sentence); (2) the number of methods of killing (the following methods were present in the cases: shooting, beating, stabbing, asphyxiating); (3) whether the murder was predatory (exploitation in the absence of a conflict); and (4) whether the offender had a prior violent conviction. Thus, we assume that a prisoner with a prior violent conviction who kidnapped, raped, and stabbed multiple women to death without provocation is more antisocial than a prisoner who shot his ex girlfriend and her new lover in the heat of an argument despite not having a prior violent conviction. The former scenario sums to 6 (predatory offense, prior violent conviction, three statutory aggravators, one method), whereas the latter scenario sums to 2 (not predatory, no prior violent conviction, one statutory aggravator, one method). The scale of antisocial personality ranges from 2 to 6, with a mean of 3.7 and a standard deviation of 1. Because the literature on apology is underdeveloped, it is not clear what other potential confounders need to be controlled. In the absence of an estab lished roster, we coded all the control variables we possibly could from the infor mation available about each case. Specifically, we control for the following characteristics of the defendant and victim: whether the murder was intra-racial, the defendant's age at the time of the murder, the defendant's education, the number of years the defendant spent on death row before execution, whether the victim was a nonstranger, whether the victim was female, and the presence of a codefendant(s). Table I provides additional details regarding the measurement strategies, data sources, and means for the controls. We use negative binomial regression to model the number of words in the prisoner's last statement, a classic "count" variable bounded at zero, and posi tively skewed. We use logistic regression to model whether the prisoner apolo gized, a binary outcome (0 = no; 1 = yes). Coefficients, transformed by exponentiation, indicate how a unit change in the independent variable is related to changes in either the expected count of words (the negative binomial models) or the odds of apologizing (the logistic models). FINDINGS We predict that death row prisoners will rarely use their last breath to apol ogize. Our reasoning is geometrical. Death row prisoners are invariably lower in status than the victim's side—the vertical distance between the parties is too great to produce a high rate of apology. Indeed, only 80 of the 232 prisoners apologized. One could argue that it is impossible to determine whether a 34%</page><page sequence="11">With God on One's Side 169 Table I.

But such a rate certainly seems low given the gravity of the crimes and the many years that prisoners had to ponder an apology. Regardless, the key question is: Does a prisoner's affiliation with God— which elevates the social status of the offender and puts the parties on a more equal plane—increase the chance of an apology? To begin, we explore whether the bivariate relationships establish a prima facie case. Table II, Panel A, indi cates that 51% of prisoners who mentioned God apologized, compared to just 21% of prisoners who did not mention God (p &lt; .000). Table II, Panel B, dem onstrates that the effect is linear. Among prisoners who mentioned God once, 36% apologized. But as the number of mentions rose, so too did the chance of an apology: 53% of prisoners who mentioned God twice apologized, and 71% of prisoners who mentioned God three or more times apologized (p &lt; .000).

Focusing on whether the prisoner claims an affiliation with God, consider the findings from Panel Bl: Mentioning God increases the expected word count by 175% (Model 1), and each unit increase in words (100) raises the odds of an apology by 83% (Model 2). Focusing on the intensity of the affiliation with God, consider the findings from Panel B2: Each mention of God increases the expected word count by 65% (Model 1), and each unit increase in words (100) raises the odds of an apology by 70% (Model 2). Interestingly, the direct effects attenuate substantially, but remain large and significant (from an odds ratio of 3.816 to 2.409; from an odds ratio of 2.048 to 1.651). Such a pattern suggests that other causal mechanisms are also at play, a topic we address in the discus sion. In sum, the data provide strong support for our argument: Prisoners whose social status has been elevated through an affiliation with God are imbued with social assertiveness, which enables expressions of regret. The mediating relationship also survives the introduction of controls for potential confounders, including antisocial personality. Although one might assume that prisoners who have the most severe antisocial personalities would reject God and refuse to apologize—rendering the hypothesized relationship spurious—the data do not support such a position. In fact, the only control vari able that consistently predicts apology is whether the prisoner was a young adult (20s) at the time of the crime. We do not attempt to interpret this finding, as it is not related to the social geometry of the case and there is no obvious explanation (but we do encourage future researchers to explore the pattern). To investigate whether the mediating relationship is robust, we replicated the models using a restricted set of cases. To be clear, we maintain that all the cases "count"—all 232 prisoners had the chance to make a last statement. But 37 prisoners declined to speak, and such cases—by definition—support our argument (affiliation with God, the count of words, and apology are all coded 0). When we focus on the 195 prisoners who made a last statement the substan tive results are unchanged: The effect of social status on social assertiveness and the effect of social assertiveness on apology both remain significant at p &lt; .05 (models available upon request). Thus, the mediating relationship survives a more conservative test.'x 16 15 In the indirect effect models predicting apology (Panel Bl, Model 2; Panel B2, Model 2), the p value for mentioning God is .07 and the p value for number of mentions is .01. Thus, the direct effect remains in the restricted set of cases (although one coefficient falls just outside the tradi tional threshold for significance). 16 One reviewer suggested that prisoners who claim to be innocent should be included in the models. We disagree on definitional grounds: admission of wrongdoing is a prerequisite for apology. Nonetheless, we estimated all the models in Table III (and the restricted set of cases) with the 33 prisoners in question (controlling for asserting innocence). The substantive results were the same (models available upon request).</page><page sequence="13">With God on One's Side 171 Table III.

First, it is possible that we have omitted important controls. That being said, the strength of the relationship —as seen in the basic percentage differences—is relatively rare in the social sciences and not likely to disappear in the face of controls (indeed, the inclusion of additional controls could strengthen the observed relationships if suppression were to occur). Second, we can only examine one type of apology: public apology. Prisoners may have apologized to the victim's family through a different mecha nism, such as writing a letter of apology or apologizing during an interview with a reporter who then publishes the statement. Prisoners who killed a family member might apologize to surviving family members during the private visitation before the execution. Nonetheless, apologies made before the last statement do not pre clude apologizing once again. Moreover, a public apology is an important object of inquiry in its own right—a statement made to the world before death. DISCUSSION Our data reveal that one of the only statistically significant predictors of apology is affiliation with God. Affiliation with a Supreme Being—an extremely high status third party—makes apology more likely because, we argue, it elevates a prisoner's location in social space, creating the conditions for greater moral assertiveness and conciliation. God cannot, however, be equated with any high status actor. God has a universal moral message, and to invoke God is to become more open to that message. By affiliating, a prisoner becomes more involved with God—through reflection, prayer, participation in religious rites, and interaction with religious others. Involvement with another is known as relational distance or intimacy (Black, 1976: 40-41). Black (1979) proposed that ideas promulgated by intimates and by high status actors enjoy greater success—they have an elevated probabil ity of being adopted. Extending this reasoning beyond statements of fact, Phil lips and Lapuck (2013) argued that the moral ideas of high status intimates tend to have a high degree of receptivity. Thus, by committing to God, a prisoner should be more likely to accept God's moral teaching. If that teaching urges for giveness and reconciliation, a prisoner affiliated with God should be more open to taking the principal step toward reconciliation that is within his or her power: apologizing. Since God's moral teaching today generally urges repentance and forgiveness, death row prisoners who declare an affiliation with God ought to be more likely to apologize to their victims. And the more often they claim affilia tion with God, the more likely they should be to apologize. Affiliation with God, then, does not just alter the social geometry of the relationship between the prisoner and victim's family; it also alters the social geometry of the relationship between the prisoner and God. Intimacy with God helps to explain why the relationship between affiliation and apology is not fully mediated by the prisoner's social assertiveness. Intimacy is also consistent with</page><page sequence="15">With God on One s Side 173 the criminological linkage of religious affiliation and prosocial behavior. How ever, criminological theory leaves unanswered a fundamental, prior question: Why does God favor apology? God need not tell prisoners to apologize. He could urge defiance. Indeed, God's message has not always been one of peace, goodwill, and harmony. In times past, He often urged vengeance rather than forgiveness, violence rather than reconciliation, as both the Bible (New and Old Testaments) and Koran suggest: Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword (Matthew 10: 34). Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man (Numbers 31: 17 18). Fighting is obligatory for you, much as you dislike it (Surah 2: 26). Slay them wherever you find them— Idolatry is worse than carnage Fight against them until idolatry is no more and God's religion reigns supreme (Surah 2: 190). If, as the Old Testament Book of Jeremiah (48: 10) states, "cursed he who holds back his sword from blood," then surely "blessed he who wields his sword with blood." When killing is righteous—as it more often was in earlier religions—it cannot be an occasion for apology. God never encouraged indiscriminate killing. But God once tolerated more killing than He does today—the range of permissible targets was considerably wider (see, e.g.. Pinker, 2011: 6-12). His message changed slowly. Even after the wrath of the Old Testament gave way to the more forgiving New Testament, much religious thought continued to encourage punitive violence (see, e.g., Pinker, 2011: 12-17). Only many centuries later did everyday religious teaching come to emphasize a more general message of reconciliation. Religious leaders today generally urge people to love their neighbors as themselves, including those of no or different faiths. And they encourage deviants, including prisoners, to repent and seek forgiveness from a loving Creator (see, e.g. Kusha, 2009; Prejean, 1993). Why has God altered his message? Pure sociology seeks the answer in the changing social geometry of belief across the ages. One such change has been the declining vertical distance between God and humans, especially those in the wealthy nations of the world. Until recently, most humans lived in poverty, could use only simple tools, had short life expectancies, could not read or write, and were ruled by governments that were deaf to their voices and indifferent to their needs (see Ridley, 2010: Chapter 1). Three centuries of unparalleled wealth creation, health improve ment, technological innovation, educational expansion, and democratic partici pation has significantly elevated the social status of humans, rendering God considerably less superior to humans than He once was.17 17 The enhanced status of humans has also resulted in a more sacred self, manifest, for example, in the reduced tolerance of violence against the person (see, e.g., Elias, 1978; Goffman, 1956). We thank Paul Colomy for pointing out this implication of our argument.</page><page sequence="16">174 Cooney and Phillips Social superiority is a strong predictor of third-party behavior. As ruler of the universe, God is the judge of all human actions. As such, God is not simply a partisan but also a settlement agent. He must adjudicate the merits of conflicts about right and wrong (even as He is invoked by one or both parties to provide partisan support). Black (1993a: 148-149) proposes that the greater the status superiority of the settlement agent, the more punitive the settlement tends to be (e.g., colonial judges stamping out native conflict). All else equal, the lower the status of offenders, relative to those who judge them, the more severe the punish ment they receive. The most inferior of all are whipped, tortured, and killed, often in extremely painful ways. Settings with great inequality (dictatorships, aristocratic societies) therefore have the strictest punishments (Black 1993a: 149).18 As settlement agent superiority declines, settlement behavior becomes less harsh, more forgiving. Moderately superior settlement agents tend to emphasize punishment less and reconciliation more (see, e.g., Cooney, 2009: 81 83). When they do adjudicate and punish, it is generally with a lighter hand (see, e.g., Cooney, 2009: 55-56, 146). Religious punishment is no different. God once punished with fire and brimstone, destroying cities (Gomorrah) and even civilization itself (Noah's ark): Sinners had to be obliterated. But God has moderated his penalties. His punishment has become less severe. Today, if God sanctions, He often does so through avoidance—by withdrawing His full support. His love. Loss of God's love impoverishes the afterlife, but it does not cause deviants to suffer excruciat ing pain for eternity. Moreover, God seeks to unite more than divide. He urges parties to forgive and reconcile. A vengeful God has little resonance today.19 God increasingly acts like a moderately superior rather than a distantly superior settlement agent for a second reason as well: Not only has the status of humans increased but His own status has decreased. In the West, God long reigned supreme over humans and all of creation. But He no longer does. Belief in God, once taken for granted, has become optional (Taylor, 2007). Science yields powerful explanations of many things once explained purely supernatu rally—disease, the weather, crop failure, economic cycles. Even if God is held to have created the laws of nature, those laws and not God explain the everyday working of the world. As an eminent historian states: God may still be perceived as the ultimate reality behind it all, as indeed he often is; but his power over the observable universe matches that of Elizabeth II over England: he has been reduced to a purely ceremonial role (in so far as he has not been dethroned alto gether). (Crone, 1989: 191) Moreover, even among believers, God's ontological status is less secure. For many, God is no longer an anthropomorphic being endowed with agency to 18 Severity also increases with the cultural and relational distance of the settlement agent. Cultural distance is a difference in the content of ideas, language, religion, or other aspects of expressive life (Black, 1976: 74). 1'' For example, when evangelical preacher Pat Robertson attributed the massive 2010 earthquake in Haiti to God's punishment, he was widely criticized and even mocked (see, e.g., www.cbsnews. com/8301-503544_162-6101136-503544.html).</page><page sequence="17">With God on One s Side 175 suspend the laws of nature but rather "an immanent, omnipresent, but non human divine" (Bender, 2008: 477). The nature of that divine has become more subjective: increasingly, God "is seen as.... some sort of vague power or, in the final reduction, our own consciences" (Bruce, 2002: 208).20 God's reduced stat ure is evident in the reduced obeisance paid Him. Prayer, church attendance, and other religious practices have declined sharply over the centuries, particu larly in Europe (see, e.g., Bruce, 2002: 45-74). Even in the United States, only about 20% of adults attend church on a weekly basis (Hadaway et al., 1993). God is not dead (see, e.g., Stark, 1999). But His status has clearly diminished. In the process, He has become less vengeful, more compassionate.21 CONCLUSION Apologies issued in the last words of individuals condemned to death repre sent one type of death row apology, not the sum total of all apologies by prison ers on death row. Many death row prisoners may have apologized previously— at the trial or in a letter from prison, for example. To the degree that the location and timing of apology vary systematically—if, for example, socially close parties are more likely to apologize in private—the Texas data are unrepresentative even of death row apologies. But they do at least provide a window onto one end of the apology spectrum: those performed in public. The critical factor in these unsolicited public apologies, we find, is not the nature of the killing but affiliation with a Supreme Being or God. We explain the finding with the theoretical paradigm of pure sociology, in terms of social geom etry. Affiliation with God increases prisoners' social status—particularly their moral status—relative to that of the victim's side (the victim and his or her parti sans). Less vertical distance liberates social actors' assertiveness and facilitates conciliatory responses to conflict: Prisoners consequently become more likely to address and apologize to the family of the person they have killed.22 Addition ally, affiliation increases intimacy with God, rendering the prisoner more recep tive to God's message. If that message is one of reconciliation, as it increasingly tends to be interpreted in modern times, then apology will occur more frequently. God's emphasis on reconciliation appears to be itself linked to His addi tional third-party role of settlement agent. For God is not just a partisan in times of strife: He is the ultimate judge of the universe. Over time, God's 20 A subjective God might be seen as an intimate God. Black (1993a) argues that intimacy between judge and deviant also reduces the severity of judgment. 21 Some readers might sense a contradiction between our claims that God is the highest status social actor and that God's status has declined over time. But there is none. The present queen of Eng land, for example, is the highest status person in her country, yet her status is not as high as that of her predecessor Queen Elizabeth I, who wielded much greater power. 22 Other conflict forms that may require a lower status person to address a higher status person directly include criticism, mediation, and negotiation. In such cases, affiliation with a high status partisan, such as God, should presumably increase the aggrieved person's loquaciousness.</page><page sequence="18">176 Cooney and Phillips judgments have become less stern and more forgiving as the vertical distance between humans and God has narrowed: Humans have risen in stature, and God, though still of singularly high status, is less supreme than He once was. If this is correct, the public apologies of death row prisoners in their last statements are best seen as a product of both a near and distant social geometry: the geome try of the murder and the geometry of modernity. Public death row apologies are undoubtedly triggered by factors other than affiliation with God. And perhaps some additional nonmeasured factor explains some or even all of the affiliation-apology relationship. Even if that is not the case, nonpublic apologies may have different dynamics and trajectories. More over, if there is a general relationship between social status and apology, we have analyzed but a small part of it. Whether extremely high status offenders are less likely to apologize, for example, remains to be established. Likewise, while equality appears to foster apology, the relationship may turn out to be more complex than we suppose. Even so, the present analysis is a step, however small, toward what must surely be the ultimate goal of scholars addressing this topic: a theory of apology. REFERENCES Akers, Ronald L. 2010.
