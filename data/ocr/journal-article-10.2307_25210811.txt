<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Vedic origins of karma : cosmos as man in ancient Indian myth and ritual. By Herman W. Tull. (SUNY Series in Hindu Studies.) pp. x, 181, Albany, N.Y., State University of New York Press, 1989. It has been well known since the early days of Indology that the concept o? karma (action) has two basic meanings in Indian religious and philosophical thought. The one which is better known concerns moral action and the other, less frequently dealt with, designates ritual action. The author argues that past scholars concentrated unduly on the moral aspect of karma taken in isolation from its proper context, which is the paradigmatic event of the Vedic ritual, and that in so doing they failed to understand generally the origin of the karma doctrine. He believes that the statements of the doctrine in the Upanisads look back, both in ideology and in practice, to patterns contained in the Vedic rite which does not have a moral dimension, but is concerned with the correctness of the ritual procedure. He tries to substantiate his thesis by analysis of the textual sources for karma in historical sequence, avoiding its consideration in isolation. The drawback of his procedure is that for the most part he relies on texts from the late Vedic period (c. 800-600 b.c.), i.e. on the Br?hmanas and the early Upanisads, giving only passing attention to the Vedic samhii?s of which the Rg Veda is particularly important even for the genesis of the karma doctrine. Within the limits which the author set himself, he has produced a consistent picture of the karma doctrine in the context of Br?hmanic thought and its continuance into the Upanisads and of the survival of the dimension of the Br?hmanic ritual world view, not only into the period of the Upanisads, but also into the subsequent phases of the development of Brahmanism as it turned into what we now know as all-embracing Hinduism in which ritual, and particularly the notion of the sacrificial rite, has retained its importance. But the author further maintains that the chief structure underlying all Br?hmanic thought is the notion that the cosmos arose from the primordial sacrifice of an "anthropomorphic being"</page><page sequence="2">402 REVIEWS OF BOOKS (Purusa-Praj?pati), a mythical feat which was first articulated in the Rg Veda 10,90. Every great sacrificial ritual replicates this cosmogonie event and in the Br?hmana texts this idea was propounded as the foundation of the entire Vedic ritual corpus. Theoretically every sacrificial ritual should therefore involve the self-sacrifice of the sacrificer himself, but in practice a substitute victim is offered and the performance of the sacrifice is entrusted to ritual specialists (priests) who, of course, obtain a sacrificial gift (daksin?) for the service. The sacrificer thus avoids actual death, but undergoes it symbolically ; yet he reaps the benefit of this (ritual) karmic process in his life. His actual death marked by funeral rites is then the final sacrifice, this time without substitution, and leads to rebirth in heaven. One cannot help feeling rather uneasy about this interpretation. According to the author the only distinction between the early Upanisads and the Br?hmanas lies mainly iir the concern of the latter with the attainment of the ritual world (and the benefits it brings), while the former look outward to the larger cosmos and the higher realms which the actual death of the correctly ritually cremated sacrificer opens to his experience ; the basic principle of attainment through the correctness of ritual action is the same. The author may be right in stressing that there is no real breach between the Br?hmanas with their ritual outlook and the early Upanisads substituting for that outlook a sudden emergence of the ethically orientated karma doctrine. The ritual connotations do linger on in the Upanisads within the newly formulated karma doctrine and were got rid of only in some schools of radical renunciates (and in early Buddhism). But it is quite wrong to deny ethical meaning to the early Upanisadic formulations of the karma doctrine, e.g. to Y?jnavalkya's dictum that " one becomes good by good action and bad by bad action " and relate them purely to the Br?hmanic world of correct or bungled ritual action. Awareness of the ethical dimension of the karmic process, along with its ritual one, was already present even in Rgvedic understanding where heaven was promised not only to those who brought sacrificial offerings, but also to those who sacrificed their lives in battle as well as to those who developed spiritual fervour (tapas; RV 10,154,2-5) and to those who chose to act in an orderly way (RV 10,14,8) and knew the law (rtaj?a; RV 10,15,1), while the wicked and unrighteous ones (p?pas?h, anrt?h, RV 4,5,5) were destined for hell. Not even the Br?hmanas are totally devoid of the ethical connotation of the karma doctrine (as hinted at in Satapatha Br?hmana 11,5,6,9). The author failed to consider the topic of the karma doctrine (which, connected with the rebirth or reincarnation doctrine, is Indo-European and predates the creation of the Vedic ritual) in the light of the now well-established principle of multi-level meaning of the Vedic texts, although he lists works of authors in which this principle was described and applied (Eliade, Gonda, Werner). This principle enables us to see how ritual, ethical and spiritual connotations coexisted in all Vedic texts at all times, even though the emphasis on one or another kept shifting, depending among other things on the recipient's stance. The author chose to concern himself with one stance, but he should not lose sight of the other stances altogether. Karel Werner</page></plain_text>
