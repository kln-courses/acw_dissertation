<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Concept of History in Matthew GEORG STRECKER ECENT research in Synoptic criticism works on the basis of source- criticism, with its "two-document theory" widely accepted despite recent attacks, and on the basis of Formsgeschichte, which classifies the tradition in types and seeks for the "Sitz im Leben" of the traditional material in the pre-Synoptic period. The new phase in Gospel criticism interests itself in the process of editing and compiling the various units of traditional material. In what follows, this method will be called "Redaktionsgeschichte," although in the strict sense of the word it does not represent a new method, but only applies to a limited subject literary methods already known. The theological situation characteristic of Matthew's concept of history presupposes the change in Christian self-understanding that occurred in the second Christian generation. The latter theological situation was determined by the beginnings of "early Catholicism," and by the conviction that the Christian community had to reckon with an indefinite continuation of human history in the future, so that the historical course of time, past as well as fu- ture, had to be accounted for.' I The first inference from our recognition of the theological-historical background of the Synoptic redactions is that there was a "historicizing" of the traditional material by the redactor Matthew. In the period between the life of Jesus and the time of the Gospel writers, there were already individual units of tradition and collections of traditional material, which contained "historical" statements about the place of the tradition in the life of Jesus. GEORG STRECKER is Professor of New Testament at the University of Bonn. This article is based on a paper presented at the Southern California School of Theology, Claremont, California, on March 17, 1965, and again at the Third International Congress on New Testament Studies in Oxford, England, on September 14, 1965. It appeared with a fuller introductory section in Evangelische Theologie, XXVI (1966), 57-74. In light of the growing interest in "Redaktionsgeschichte," it is being made available to readers of this Journal. The author expresses his thanks to William A. Beardslee, Associate Editor of JAAR, for valuable assistance in preparing the materials for publication. 1 For a fuller account of the background and the situation of recent Synoptic scholar- ship, as support for the first two paragraphs of the present article and as supplying references to the most important literature, see the fuller introduction to the German version in Evan- gelische Theologie, XXVI (1966), 57 ff.

The Q-source represented an early form of the Gospels in so far as it contained a primitive, chronological arrangement of the speech material, for it probably began with the tradition of the preaching of John the Baptist and ended with the apocalyptic speech of Jesus. Finally, with its out- line - "from the appearance of John the Baptist to the passion and resurrec- tion of Jesus" - the Gospel of Mark already anticipated the essential elements of a portrayal of the life of Jesus. Matthew, however, extensively amplified the outline of temporal references that he found in these sources. To the Marcan outline he prefixed a genealogy of Jesus, as well as the infancy nar- rative (in chaps. 1-2). Even if this implies a theological interpretation, since here Jesus is already presented as the Son of David and as the one who fulfills the promises given to the people of Israel, still a historical intention is at the same time involved. By enlarging Mark's outline with respect to the beginning of Jesus' life, Matthew indicates that he is reflecting on the past as such. It is no accident that Luke proceeds in exactly the same way; he also amplifies the Marcan source with an infancy narrative and a genealogy of Jesus. If Luke has rightly been called a "historian" - the existence of Luke-Acts confirms to a certain extent the validity of this designation - then this paral- lelism might lead us to suppose a historical tendency in Matthew also. But beyond that, Matthew elaborated his Marcan source in terms of chronology. Contrary to Mark, he inserted in his Gospel at characteristic points the chron- ological formula 6a'r rrE6 ("from that time on.. ."). This formula char- acterizes the beginning of Jesus' preaching;2 it marks the beginning of the first passion prediction as an introduction to the last stage of Jesus' way to passion, death, and resurrection (16:21); and it is inserted into the Marcan outline at the beginning of the betrayal of Jesus by Judas (26:16). This for- mula, like the numerous other indications of chronology in Matthew's Gospel, is not meant to express a development of the life of Jesus, but it nevertheless emphasizes a temporal, linear movement, in contrast to the traditional material. 2 4:17. Cf. the careful study of E. Krentz, "The Extent of Matthew's Prologue: To- ward the Structure of the First Gospel," Journal of Biblical Literature, 83 (1964), 409-14. According to Krentz, the passage 1:1-4, 16 represents a composite literary unit referring to the David- and Abraham-sonship of Jesus. Starting from the adr '66re formula in 4:17 and 16:21 the structure of Matthew's Gospel is conceived as follows: 1) 4:16-16, 20 ("atLXEela"); 2) 16:21-28:20 (or 26:2) ("The Son of Man and his way to resurrec- tion") (p. 411). Concerning this division, however, we have to ask if the 3aOLXEla-proc- lamation can really be understood as being the theme of the first main passage 4:17-16:20 --in contrast with 16:21 ff. (cf., on the other hand, also 18:23 ff.; 21:33 ff.; 22:1 ff.; 25:1 ff., etc.); on the other side, account has to be taken of the fact that the Son-of-Man subject is also presupposed in the passage 4:17 ff. (cf., e. g., 12:8, 32, etc.). Yet also the frequent attempts to reconstruct the composition of the Gospel on the strength of the five formulas of connection and transition (see below, note 20) cannot really convince; thus, the consequence at hand is that Matthew, instead of working out and arranging a detailed composed structure, was rather concerned to constitute the Gospel as a whole in terms of a continuous line, which can be fixed temporally and geographically, and the essence of which is to be characterized by "the proclamation and presentation of the eschatological demand."</page><page sequence="3">THE CONCEPT OF HISTORY IN MATTHEW 221 Another example of Matthew's historicizing of tradition may be taken from the realm of geographical concepts. If one compares Matthew and Mark in respect to the idea of the "house" in which Jesus stays, it is evident that in Mark we find a topological meaning. The concept of "house" is a part of the theory of the messianic secret and refers to the place of revelation, which is separated from the public; here, the paradoxical unity of the revealed and hidden messiahship of Jesus becomes clear. Thus, according to this idea in Mark's Gospel, the "house" is not fixed geographically; it can be found any- where that Jesus' revelatory activity requires.3 In Matthew, however, the situation is different. By the way he chooses and frames the corresponding Marcan passages, Matthew shows that he understood the motif primarily in terms of geography rather than topology. The "house" is located at a certain place in the Palestinian region, at Capernaum.4 This corresponds to the fact that only Matthew designates Capernaum as Jesus' "own city" (9:1), and he alone can speak of Jesus "dwelling" in Capernaum (4:13). This means that the originally topological idea has become geographically limited. Not only chronological and geographical statements are used in the First Gospel to point out the historical character of the traditional material. The use of a special source of collected quotations is much more important in this connection. Matthew made his own use of this collection in the so-called "formula-quotations" of his special material.6 In the framework of redaction, the formula-quotations presuppose, in accord with their pre-Matthean mean- ing, that the promises of God to the people of Israel have found fulfillment in the life of Jesus. This means on the other hand that the promises have found fulfillment in the life of Jesus. Without doubt, Matthew emphasized the latter, since the quotations are connected with temporal and, above all, geographical statements about the life of Jesus. Accordingly, the different stages of the life SCf. Mark 2:1; 3:20; 7:17; 9:28, 33; 10:10. 4 Matt. 8:14; 9:10, 28; 12:46; 13:1, 36; 17:25. 5 Matt. 1:23; 2:6, 15, 18, 23; 4:15 f.; 8:17; 12:18-21; 13:35; 21:5; 27:9 f. All of these verses (with the one exception of the redactional statement in 2:23) are quotations from the Old Testament, the wording of which - despite a few traces of influence from the LXX - points to the Masoretic or to an unknown Old Testament text. They have not been quoted originally by the evangelist Matthew, for he used the Old Testament in the version of the LXX, though he inserted them into his Gospel, as proved by the Matthean character of the introductory formulas. The widely held opinion, which recently has been repeated by A. Suhl (Die Funktion der alttestamentlichen Zitate und Anspielungen im Markus- evangelium, 1965, p. 35, note 64), that the formula-quotations must be ascribed to Matthew, proves to be unavailing, as it is impossible to explain conclusively the textual and material discrepancies between the redactional LXX-quotations and the specific type of the formula- quotations. Matt. 3:3 (= Isa. 40:3) is not to be connected with the formula-quotations of Matthew's peculiar material. This passage rather follows the text of Mark 1:3, and its introductory formula points back to Mark 1:2a, though it has been extended by Matthew; nor must the quotation Matt. 13:14 f. (= Isa. 6:9 f.) be listed here, which has rather to be understood as a post-Matthean interpolation, as has definitely been demonstrated by K. Stendahl's impressive study, The School of St. Matthew and its Use of the Old Testament 1954, p. 131.</page><page sequence="4">222 GEORG STRECKER of Jesus - Bethlehem, Egypt, Nazareth, Capernaum - are emphasized.6 This is also shown by the fact that biographical details are made known (so, for example, Jesus' performance of miracles or his entry into Jerusalem.) This means that Matthew uses the formula-quotations to interpret the history of Jesus as a unique event, temporally and geographically distant from his own situation. The inclusion of these quotations in the Gospel expresses the historical-biographical tendency of the redactor. This historicizing adaptation of traditional material also implies a specific understanding of the content. Matthew is the only one of the evangelists who transmitted a logion about limiting Jesus' proclamation to the people of Israel: "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel" (15:24). This saying appears also in 10:6, as a missionary command to the disciples. Especially on the basis of this latter passage it has been supposed that here lies a self-inter- pretation on the part of the evangelist. According to this opinion, the saying must be regarded as an expression of Jewish-Christian self-understanding, an expression of Matthew's community which wanted to restrict missionary effort to the Jewish people.' However, Matthew belongs to a gentile-Christian generation, which pursues as self-evident the universal mission to all nations, as the end of the Gospel makes clear.8 The exclusiveness of the mission to Israel, apparent in this logion, finds no explanation in the situation of the re- dactor, but rather corresponds to his historical reflection: Only for Jesus, and thus for the disciples in the lifetime of Jesus, is this restriction valid. Only during the life of Jesus is the proclamation directed exclusively to the people of Israel, to call them to repentance. Matthew shows that this call is con- stantly rejected, above all by the Pharisees and Sadducees, the representatives of theology. Whereas the Jewish people are characterized in the first part of the Gospel as a chorus that applauds the deeds of Jesus, by contrast in the passion the entire nation joins the cry demanding crucifixion (27:22). After the condemnation of Jesus, the priority of Israel is abolished and the mission is broadened and directed without exception to all nations of the world. Hence, it becomes evident how Matthew understood history, and which historical aspect he followed when historicizing the traditional material. The course of history was conceived as a sequence of periods: The central epoch of history is the "time of Jesus," the time when Jesus is sent exclusively to 6 That the geographical line is extraordinarily prominent from the beginning of the Gospel up to 4:16, has rightly been pointed out by E. Krentz (op. cit., p. 413). 7Thus, e. g., J. Munck, Paul and the Salvation of Mankind, 1959, pp. 263 f.; especially B. C. Butler, who from the Jewish coloring of the pericope Matt. 15:21-28 deduces an argument to support the priority of Matthew against Mark and Luke (The Originality of St. Matthew, 1951, pp. 130 f.). 8 Cf. Matt. 28:16-20; also 10:18; 21:33-46; 22:1-14; 24:9, 14; 25:32. In this respect I am in far-reaching agreement with W. Trilling, who in the third edition of his book em- phatically points to the "universalistic gentile-Christian" character of the final redaction of the first Gospel (Das wahre Israel, Studien zur Theologie des Matthaeus-Evangeliums, 1964, pp. 214 ff.). Cf. already K. W. Clark, "The Gentile Bias in Matthew," Journal of Biblical Literature, 66 (1947), 165-72.</page><page sequence="5">THE CONCEPT OF HISTORY IN MATTHEW 223 the people of Israel. This is brought to expression by the frequent use of the christological title "Son of David" with reference to Jesus; the "Son of David" is the promised Saviour of Israel.' The disciples of Jesus are a part of the uniqueness of this epoch. Like the mission of Jesus, their preaching re- mains at first directed exclusively to the Jewish people.x0 And while Jesus is presented as the elevated kyrios, who shows no anthropomorphic emotions, feels neither "indignation" nor "pity,"" and demonstrates that his power as a miracle worker is beyond all human imagination,12 the disciples of Jesus are portrayed in the same idealizing way. As followers of Jesus they possess "understanding" and they do the will of God.'3 So, the time of Jesus is a unique, unrepeatable, holy, and ideal epoch in the course of history, to the unity and completeness of which the figure of John the Baptist also contrib- utes. For John, as is said in 21:32, "came in the way of righteousness" before the public appearance of Jesus, and like Jesus and his disciples, he proclaims the call to repentance motivated by the nearness of the Kingdom. Thus, the time of Jesus, from birth to resurrection, became a unitary period of revelation through the one proclamation." The time of Jesus is preceded by a time of preparation, which, like the period of the fathers and the prophets, points forward to the life of Jesus.15 It is also a time of preparation in that it is the period when the call of the prophets is rejected and the prophets are murdered.16 It has ended with the life of Jesus, involving the rejection of Jesus' call to repentance and the loss of Israel's priority in Heilsgeschichte.17 The time of Jesus is followed by the time of the church, the time of world mission. This epoch is to last until the eschaton breaks in. For the period immediately before the end will be a time 9 Cf. Matt. 1:1 (=-Son of Abraham); 9:27; 12:23; 15:22; 21:9, 15; 22:41-45. 10 Matt. 10:6. 11 Cf., e.g., Matt. 19:14 (against Mark 10:14); 8:3b (against Mark 1:43); 8:3a (against Mark 1:41). 12 See Matt. 8:13 (against Luke 7:10); 9:22 (against Mark 5:34); 15:28 (against Mark 7:24); 17:18 (against Mark 9:27); 21:19 f. (against Mark 11:14, 20 f.); 14:20 f. (against Mark 6:43 f.); 15:37 f. (against Mark 8:8 f.), and frequently. 1i Matt. 13:16, 51; 16:12; 17:13; cf. also the elimination of the Marcan concept that Jesus' disciples do "not understand:" Mark 4:13; 6:52; 8:17 f., 21; 9:6, 10, 32, etc. The idea that the disciples "perform God's will" is expressed especially in 12:49 f. (against Mark 3:34 f.). 14 The parallel between John the Baptist and Jesus (or Jesus' disciples) becomes evi- dent by a comparison of 3:2 with 4:17. The chronologically difficult term E v &amp; rals 7jlkpats KELZLts (3:1) can also be motivated by the presupposed material relationship. 16 Besides the genealogy of Jesus in 1:2-17 and the introductory formulas of the formula- quotations, cf. especially Matt. 11:13. 16 Cf. 23:29 ff. 17 Cf. 21:39, 41, 43; 22:7 if.; 23:38 f.; especially the cry for crucifixion and the Jews' declaration of their guilt in 27:22, 25 (the latter statement against Mark!). It is characteristic of this concept that the naming of the Jewish people is changed; "Israel" is used in Matthew until after the crucifixion and resurrection, when the more distant expression "Jews" is applied (28:15).</page><page sequence="6">224 GEORG STRECKER of extreme tribulation, of false prophecy, persecution, and temptation,"8 which are characteristics already specifically present in the time of Matthew's community.'" Therefore, all these are signs not of a new period, but rather of the last phase of history moving straight to its goal. They are signs of a history unfolding in three epochs, the center of which is the time of Jesus as the time of revelation. II Matthew's periodicizing represents, however, only the formal aspect of his concept of history. Unlike Luke, who is restricted primarily to showing "the fact" of the sequence of periods, Matthew was concerned to work out in detail which meaning and which task were implied within this history. This can be shown by the fact that he submitted the traditional material not only to a historicization, but, moreover, to an "ethicization." As a comparison with the Q-tradition attested in Luke shows, Matthew has combined the sayings material into five blocks of speeches and has underscored them in the framework of his Gospel with five similarly composed formulas.20 According to Matthew's understanding, the time of Jesus is a time of proclamation, in which the ethical demand is raised, as the content of the speech tradition, es- pecially of the Sermon on the Mount, makes clear. It is in this ethical demand that the period prior to Jesus had its aim, for the people of Israel had rejected the demanding will of God proclaimed by the Old Testament prophets. And from here the period of the church can be understood, which follows upon the time of Jesus and his ethical proclamation." This concept of history, focused as it is on the ethical demand, becomes evident in Matthew's presentation of the life of Jesus, when he modifies the traditional material in a practical-ethical sense. The pre-Matthean tradition took a stand on the question of divorce and without any exception character- ized separation and subsequent marriage as adultery, as is shown in Mark's Gospel and in the Q-source. Matthew, by contrast, has inserted an exception clause. The pre-Matthean rule holds good "except on the ground of Trop Pvla" (5:32; 19:9). Thus, Matthew has mitigated the judgment, which was originally more rigorous, and by producing a practicable law has taken account of the needs of the community in his time. In a similar way, the commandment against oath-taking, expressed in the series of antitheses, has been changed. While in the pre-Matthean tradition this commandment ended with an exhor- 18 Matt. 24:9-28. 19 Cf. 5:10 If.; 7:15 ff.;10:17 If.; 18:6 If., and frequently. 20 Matt. 7:28; 11:1; 13:53; 19:1; 26:1 (the formula originates from Q; cf. Luke 7:1). 21 This is emphasized by 28:20 (the demand to observe all commandments of Jesus' teaching, and the promise that the exalted kyrios will be present in his community.) Cf. A. V6gtle, "Das christologische und ekklesiologische Anliegen von Mt. 28, 18-20," Studia Evangelica, II, ed. F. L. Cross, TU, 87 (1964), 266-94; G. Bornkamm, "Der Aufer- standene und der Irdische. Mt. 28, 16-20," Zeit und Geschichte (Festschrift fiir R. Bultmann) 1964, pp. 171-91.</page><page sequence="7">THE CONCEPT OF HISTORY IN MATTHEW 225 tation to absolute trustfulness ("Let your yes be yes, and your no be no"), Matthew has completely reversed the original meaning: "Let what you say be simply 'yes, yes,' or 'no, no'; anything more than this comes from evil" (5:37). For, thereby, the originally absolute commandment has been broken and a formula has been quoted, which was used in Judaism in place of a fully spoken oath, when there was oath-taking.22 The formula may well have been customary in Matthew's community. Here is a further example of the redac- tional alteration of the tradition and of the adaptation of the traditional material to the situation of the community: The demand of Jesus, which is the central point in the course of history, is an ethical-practicable rule. The ethicizing modification of the traditional material becomes apparent, above all, in the Matthean tendency to express the ethical demands with for- mulas that set forth principles. Thus, the commandment of love for God and neighbor appears as the summation of the Old Testament (in 22:27-40) and as the summary of the Sermon on the Mount.23 Even if the individual com- mandments of Jesus in Matthew's Gospel cannot be subsumed in every case under the love commandment,24 still the intention is apparent to present the ethical proclamation of Jesus in the form of principles. This does not mean that a commandment to love, given in the form of a principle, stands in con- trast to a concrete realization of the goal. On the contrary, it is understood in an ethically practical sense. This also becomes clear, when the proclamation of Jesus is contrasted with Pharisaism. In Matthew's Gospel Pharisaism does not primarily reflect the situation of contemporary Judaism,25 but rather has the function of a topos, which represents the attitude of unbelief and thus also of iniquity, in contrast to the ethical demand. Like the Sadducees as the repre- sentatives of the official theology, the Pharisees accept the demand of the ceremonial law as obligatory for themselves. Thus, they exhibit concretely the attitude of "hypocrisy," which is contrary to the ethical demand of Jesus and which recognizes only the observance of external forms, without a cor- responding inner disposition.26 In contrast, the ethical demand of Jesus, ac- cording to Matthew, radically claims an identity between external and internal 22 Cf. Slav. Enoch 49:1, and frequently; H. L. Strack and P. Billerbeck, Kommentar zum Neuen Testament aus Talmud und Midrasch, I, 2nd ed. (1956), pp. 336 f. 21 Matt. 7:12; cf. also 9:13; 12:7; 19:19. 24 Note especially the pre-Matthean legal formula in 23:23 (Kplers, E`XEos, and 7rlarTs), but also the different concrete legal commandments, the content of which does not disclose any material relationship to the commandment of love. 25 Against G. D. Kilpatrick, The Origins of the Gospel According to St. Matthew, 2nd ed., 1960, pp. 113 ff. The fact that in Matthew's presentation of the "Sadducees" (who are frequently mentioned, though they had almost no political and religious function after the year 70) as well as in his presentation of the "high priests" there is an underlying "his- toricizing concern" has been rightly recognized by R. Hummel (Die Auseinandersetzung z'wischen Kirche und Judentum im Matthaeusevangelium, 1963, pp. 20 f.); it was not realized by this author, however, that this insight should be applied also to the Pharisees and that the inferences drawn with regard to "the present situation (of Matthew's community)" must be secondary in comparison with the question of Matthew's theological and his- toricizing intention. 26 Cf., e. g., Matt. 6:1 ff.; 15:1 ff.; 23:1 ff.</page><page sequence="8">226 GEORG STRECKER attitude. Unlike the hypocritical attitude of the Pharisees, this demand is to be fulfilled without regard to human reward.27 According to Matthew's understanding, the commandment of Jesus is more than just a call for the correspondence of external and internal attitude. As the commandment of love it is at the same time the demand for a righteous- ness that is different from that of the Pharisees and scribes. By demanding a radical and far-reaching ethical attitude it claims more than the Pharisaic tradition (cf. 5:20). It appeals to the Old Testament, in the sense of claiming to be the fulfillment and not the abolition of the Old Testament command- ments (5:17). But still it is not identical in detail with the Old Testament law. In spite of its positive relation to the Old Testament, it is not just the demand of a "new Moses,"28 but the law of the kyrios, whose authority is not of a derivable sort but can be recognized by the mighty eschatological works of Jesus. This can be seen even more clearly if we ask about the motivation of Jesus' ethical demand. The attempt has often been made to explain the moti- vation of Jesus' command of righteousness in Matthew's Gospel by comparing it with the doctrine of justification in Pauline theology. According to this suggestion, the ethical demand would be preceded by an indicative "right- eousness" as the gift of God, which is prior to all effort of men and thus limits it. This suggestion has often been supported by referring to the beati- tude, where the expression "those who hunger and thirst for righteousness" (5:6) presupposes the idea that "righteousness" is a gift of God.29 If SO, there would be a parallel in the Pauline definition of the relation between indicative 27 Cf. 6:1; 23:28, and frequently. The radical form of the ethical demand, in opposition to iurbKpLaLs, is also expressed in the pericope Matt. 19:16-26; here the list of the single commandments of the Decalogue and their subsumption under the commandment to love one's neighbor (19:18 f.) are followed by the demand for perfection as the demand to give up all possessions (19:21). This might be understood as an intended differentiation between a general Christian attitude limited to obedience of the commandments of the Decalogue on one hand, and the particular ethics of perfection on the other side. (Thus G. Kretschmar, in the article "Ein Beitrag zur Frage nach dem Ursprung fruehchristlicher Askese," ZThK, 61 [1964], 27-67, in which starting from this point the line is carried forward to the early Christian proclamation and asceticism in Syria.) According to Matthew's understanding, however, 19:21 has rather to be interpreted as an expression of the idea that in keeping the commandments a radical human decision is implied. This may be confirmed by the fact that both the demand for righteousness and the demand for perfection are without distinction directed to the one aim: entering the /aa3cela (5:20; 19:16 f., 24, and frequently). 28 In his detailed study, The Setting of the Sermon on the Mount (1964, pp. 14 ff.), W. D. Davies, despite his readiness in principal to admit that there are elements of a Moses- Christ-typology in the First Gospel, arrives at a negative result: "Matthew presents Jesus as giving a Messianic Law on a Mount, but he avoids the express concept of a New Torah and a New Sinai: he has cast around his Lord the mantle of a teacher of righteousness, but he avoids the express ascription to him of the honorific 'a New Moses' " (p. 108). This statement would probably have been made with no less decisiveness in the chapters dealing with the exegesis of single pericopes, if the author had dealt with the questions of Tradi- tionsgeschichte and Redaktionsgeschichte in a more intensive way. 29 Cf., e. g., E. Lohmeyer, Das Evangelium des Matthaeus, ed. W. Schmauch, 1956, ad loc.</page><page sequence="9">THE CONCEPT OF HISTORY IN MATTHEW 227 and imperative, according to which the imperative of the new life arises from the indicative of the new being. Nevertheless, the beatitude in 5:6 has the sense, not of a desire for a gift from God, but of great human effort directed toward realizing the demand of righteousness.30 The Matthean understanding of "righteousness" does not imply the thought of a righteousness given by God, but a righteousness realized by men, which is the same thing as justice. The motivation for Jesus' ethical demand, therefore, does not arise from the idea of a previous gift, but is to be derived from another connection in Matthew's theology. Like the preaching of John the Baptist, the teaching of Jesus is directed to the eschaton.31 Jesus announces the Reign of God and God's judgment according to one's deeds. Correspondingly, the Beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount are nothing other than conditions for entry into the Kingdom of God.32 That the ethical demand of Jesus is directed toward the eschatological future follows from Matthew's concept of reward and punish- ment. At the Last Judgment reward and punishment for each individual will be meted out according to his deeds. This motivates the ethical demand out of the future and intensifies the responsibility of individual Christians in the present. Because of this motivation out of the eschatological future, the ethical demand of Jesus can also be called an eschatological demand, all the more so as it is eschatologically motivated, not only out of the future, but also in the present.33 That is to say, it is an eschatological demand in so far as the es- chatological Reign of God is thought to be present in the demand of Jesus. Like the proclamation of the ethical demand, the mighty works of Jesus are signs of the present Reign of God.34 This means, however, that the "gift" 80 Even if we refer &amp;bKawobv l Oeoi3 in 6:33 to "God's own doing of righteousness" and connect this with 5:48 (as P. Stuh1macher does in his Gerechtigkeit Gottes bei Paulus, 1965, p. 189; cf. in addition Matt. 5:45!), nevertheless in the Gospel of Matthew this con- cept essentially has been interpreted in terms of Christology and anthropology: Man en- counters "God's righteousness" in the demand of Jesus; the "realization of the divine law" (E. Kisemann, "Die Anfdinge christlicher Theologie," ZThK, 57 (1960), 182 f.: ad 5, 6) is accomplished primarily in man's realization of the eschatological demand proclaimed by Jesus. Undoubtedly this latter, not an apocalyptic-ontological idea of God's righteousness, has been emphasized, since it forms the center of Matthew's theology; therefore, despite A. Schlatter's attempt to harmonize "righteousness" and "grace" (Der Evangelist Mattiius, 1929, pp. 234 f.), the difference between Matthew's theological concept and the Pauline notion of sola gratia must not be overlooked. 31 Cf. Matt. 3:2 and 4:17. 2 Thus, rightly, H.

Salvation is present in time by the demand of Jesus. Thus, the real mission of Jesus within history according to Matthew's understanding is the proclamation of the ethical demand in which the still- awaited Reign of God has become present. This demand is also represented by the exemplary conduct of Jesus during his earthly life. Hence, the entire life of Jesus, through word and deed, is a presentation of the ethical demand, that is, the "way of righteousness."3" III What function does the church have within a course of history thus con- ceived? This question implies a methodological problem: The interest of the redactor is directed to the past, to the time of Jesus' life; therefore, the Gospel must be explained primarily in terms of Christology, not in terms of ecclesi- ology. Matthew's understanding of the church is not expressed directly in his Gospel." On the other hand, Matthew's historicizing of the traditional material has not led to an authentic presentation of the life of Jesus, but is - even by its implied consciousness of the distance between past and pres- ent - an expression of the redactor's theological self-understanding and as such also reflects Matthew's understanding of the church. If we now look for expressions that give some information about Matthew's understanding of the church, we can state that to Matthew's interpretation of history in terms of "historicization" and "ethicization" there corresponds an "institu- tionalization," or "ecclesiasticalization," of the traditional material. The Gospel of Matthew, even more strongly than the parallel Synoptists, gives evidence of the existence of church officials. Even if there are no certain details about how these church officials were classified in Matthew's com- munity, still it is probable - according to 23:34 - that Matthew presupposes "prophets, wise men, and scribes" as officials in the Christian community, 36 Cf. Matt. 21:32. 36 This statement must be made especially in view of the third, and in many respects modified, edition of W. Trilling's study. Trilling motivates his ecclesiologically determined starting point by referring to "the present experience and reality of the church and (to) the fulness of her faith," which is valid at any time (op. cit., p. 20). He levels his criticism against a christologically accentuated interpretation of the First Gospel, stating that this interpretation would imply "a shortening of perspectives and an almost anxious narrowing of the concept of the Church," which he leads back to "transient existential experiences and hermeneutical motifs" (pp. 19 f.). Without question, however, Trilling's study in its very basis is determined by a specific position, which comprises Trilling's extensive under- standing of the church. This example is instructive enough to demonstrate the fact that the recent discovery of historical criticism in modern Roman Catholic exegesis does not auto- matically lead to an acceptance of the results of Protestant research. It is rather to be ex- pected that the interdenominational partnership within the application of the historical- critical method will bring about a clarification and classification of exegetical problems, last but not least in such a way that the absence of a common hermeneutical basis will become evident. In order to elucidate the problem at hand it will be necessary in the future to discuss the controversial theological positions, which are underlying the exegetical work, in a more detailed way.</page><page sequence="11">THE CONCEPT OF HISTORY IN MATTHEW 229 and that he especially esteems the position of a Christian scribe, as can be seen from the logion 13:52. Moreover, we should recognize that even the pre-Matthean sayings material shows a specific character that must have been influenced by the way of thinking typical of the scribes. This is shown, for instance, by the frequent use of the principle of "round numbers" or by the quotation-source, which is influenced by the idea of fulfillment, and by the fact that these same elements play a not unimportant part in Matthew's re- daction. If perhaps one should avoid speaking of a "school of Matthew" without a terminological limitation, nevertheless all of this indicates that the redactor, like the tradition that preceded him, has modified the traditional material in line with concepts characteristic of the scribes.37 In addition to these traces of the existence of church officials, we find clearer evidence of the beginning of institutionalization. In 18:15 ff. Matthew has pictured the basic features of a disciplinary practice established by the church, according to which the assembly of the local community has the right to take disciplinary action against unrepentant members and to exercise the power of binding and loosing, that is, to exclude or to re-admit a member. This action of the community in the present time has the assent of the exalted Lord; it has an eschatological consequence. Exclusion from the church's fel- lowship is identical with eschatological condemnation, just as readmittance is equivalent to the repeal of such a judgment. Matthew's community administers an eschatologically qualified system of discipline.38 The presentation of the sacraments also corresponds to an institutionaliza- tion of the community's life. According to Matthew's understanding, the baptism of Jesus represents "fulfillment of righteousness."39 This means that the sacrament of baptism is generally seen from the viewpoint of obedience to the demand for righteousness. In the redactional context, Matthew has not attempted to establish baptism as a sacramental occurrence, nor does the baptismal formula quoted in triad form in 28:19 have any support in the re- dactional material. The decisive tendency of Matthew's redactional activity points in the direction of a legalization of baptism. Baptism is an expression of "conversion," which stands at the beginning of Christian life, and therefore it is an initiatory rite which introduces one into the corporate body of the community. Likewise, Matthew's presentation of the words of institution at 37 By calling Matthew a "converted Jewish Rabbi" ("Matthaeus als Rabbi und Kate- chet," ZNW, 27 (1928), 343) E. v. Dobschiitz neglects the fact that the redactor of the First Gospel is dependent on a Christian scribal tradition. No one should deny the Semitic tinge of this tradition nor its Semitic-Jewish origin; however, this tradition becomes acces- sible to Matthew within a process of transmission. Its Semitic character has increasingly been transformed according to the needs of a Hellenistic environment; Matthew is the last active part within the course of such development of tradition. 38 Cf. the close parallel in John 20:23, according to which the disciples are entrusted with the authority to forgive sins by the risen kyrios. The difference between John 20:23 and the tradition of Matthew is significant. In the Gospel of John are lacking the escha- tological-disciplinary interpretation of the power of binding and loosing as well as the juridical terminology that originates from the institution of excommunication of the synagogue. S Matt. 3:15.</page><page sequence="12">230 GEORG STRECKER the Lord's Supper expresses this twofold concept: on the one hand, the com- munity fully possesses the power to forgive sins, as is evident when it admin- isters its system of discipline; and on the other hand, the sacrament is under- stood essentially as a fulfillment of the eschatological demand of Jesus. This becomes clear in the imperative forms that Matthew gives to the words of institution.40 The sacrament of the Lord's Supper is not above the institutional activity of the community, but is part of it, and thus is a further example of the institutionalization of tradition. From here the function of the church within Matthew's concept of history becomes evident: The Christian church represents the ethical demand in time.41 By proclaiming this demand the church guarantees the continuity be- tween the past time of Jesus and the present up to the final goal of history, which will be reached in a near or far future. The church points the way that individual Christians have to go within the changes of the times. Matthew's understanding of history, as expressed in his tendencies of his- toricizing, ethicizing, and institutionalizing, proves the fact that the Matthean redaction does not represent simply a collection of traditional material, but offers an independent theological view. This clearly verifies that Matthew's theology is not to be paralleled directly with other theological schemes in the New Testament. It corresponds neither to the older Jesus-tradition nor to Pauline or Johannine theology. Rather it gives evidence of the heterogeneity of the primitive Christian faith, which is represented by a complexity of dif- ferent theological conceptions.42 A responsible consideration of the bases of the proclamation and the Christian faith must observe such differences care- fully and weigh their theological significance. It will not be able, despite all its legitimate criticism, to cast aside as irrelevant the message of Matthew,43 namely the heightened responsibility of the individual toward the eschato- logical-ethical demand within the change of times. 40 Matt. 26:26-28. 41 This understanding of the church relativizes the relationship between church and world, since the nations of the world as well as the Christian community are judged accord- ing to the standard of the ethical demand (25:31 ff.). Trilling's assertion that such a rela- tionship would contradict the parallel between the church and the people of God according to 21:43 (op. cit., p. 154, note 46) is not convincing at all; for, on the one hand, the parallel drawn between the church and the Old Testament-Jewish nation of God does not answer the question of the tertium comparationis, i. e., of the content which fills the notion of God's people as well as the concept of the church. If we realize that the idea of God's people has been concentrated on the eschatological demand that is proclaimed and followed by the church, the thesis mentioned above may be supported; on the other hand, the idea of the independence of the church has not been given up - despite the relative character of the difference between church and world - since the church is aware of being bound to the kyrios, who not only endowed his community with the eschatological demand, but also en- trusted it with the fovoria to forgive sins. 42 Cf. recently H. K6ster, "PrN1MAI AIA(OPOI: The Origin and Nature of Diversifi- cation in the History of Early Christianity," Harvard Theological Review, 58 (1965), 279-318. 41 G. Kretschmar rightly calls the message of Matthew a "beneficial disturbance of the Church" (op. cit., p. 67). This characterization is especially justified, if it is acknowl- edged that Matthew's demand for righteousness includes radicalism and concreteness (see above, note 27).</page></plain_text>
