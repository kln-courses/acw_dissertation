<plain_text><page sequence="1">BUDDHISTISCHE KUNST OSTASIENS. By Dietrich Seckel. Stuttgart, W. Kohlhammer, 1957. 373 pages, introduction, biblio- graphy, 169 plates in monochrome, 2 maps, chronological table, index. For years scholars have been writing about Buddhism and the art which sprang from that faith. A number of works have introduced the religion to a Western audience in a global fashion, but up to the present no one has seen fit, or been able to do the same service for Buddhist art. However, this need has been answered now in large measure by Prof. Seckel, in his concise review of East-Asian Buddhist art. To one brought up in a tradition of European art, the Bud- dhist art of East Asia will seem quite strange, as strange as the many sects of Mahhyhna Buddhism, whose Weltanschauung few Westerners have been able to approach and still fewer have understood adequately. Monographic treatment of Buddhist art has been generously accorded, as can be seen in the book's biblio- graphy. But up to now no attempt has been made to grasp the general principles and guiding ideas of the art. The prime im- portance of this book is that it is a pioneer. Obviously, a pioneer has limitations, of which Prof. Seckel is quite conscious. He says that it may be too early for a broad synthesis, nevertheless he has taken up this work in the opinion that no single area is or can be explored in its single features before a general map is drawn of the whole. Limitations spring up naturally in this field. Not all Bud- dhism has place in this discussion, for the other main branch,</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 231 the anti-metaphysical Hinayana, has afforded too arid a field in which to plant a flourishing art. The author further restricts himself to Chinese and Japanese art, with its bridge in Korea, for even though the roots are in India, still a relatively pure Buddhist art untouched by Hinduism is little to be found there. Moreover, in discussing the art of China and Japan, Japanese art receives the burden of attention, for two reasons. First is the governmental restriction upon travel and research in China, and a scarcity of art objects which have survived the ravages of time; second is the amazing state of preservation of Japanese art ob- jects. The works piled up in Japan's collection are a collective consciousness of tradition and history, representing a complete line of all the periods of growth. From these facts arises the impossibility of comparing details in Japanese and Chinese art. Where the Chinese originals are destroyed, and the materials one has to work with are so vague, complete explanation is impossible. Judging from available materials, Prof. Seckel has established the hypothesis that in general the Japanese corpus of Buddhist art represents the essential lines of East Asian Buddhist art. His further analysis is built on this foundation. Buddhist art can be approached from two angles: from the point of view of the artifact itself, and from its religious function. Not being a study of aesthetics, the book gives little attention to the value of an individual work or style, except insofar as it illustrates iconography (fulfilling a religious function) and sym- bolism. To understand this latter, it is necessary to make a cursory review of the principal lines of Mahayana doctrine. To fight his way out of the jungle in this most complicated and extensive field, Seckel's method is typological. Only when necessary to explain or clarify a point does he bring in a historic analysis. Since religious art is the concrete expression of a religion, there is need of a description of the religious, philosophical, and cultural-historical principles forming the art's background. Euro- pean medieval art can not be understood outside the context of the world-view of the Catholic faith and the panoramic scope of Scholastic philosophy. (Seckel himself is tempted to compare Buddhist and medieval Christian art, but leaves it as an inter- esting irrelevancy.) A gentleman's knowledge of the main lines of Buddhism may be gained from the book without previous readings in the subject. As a background for understanding the art, three points are</page><page sequence="3">232 Reviews most important. First is the unity of the absolute and phenomenal, the fundamental principle of Mahayana Buddhism. This makes Buddhist art a Darstellung, the personification or representation of the transcendent by all its possible manifestations. Where this representation in concrete symbol is impossible (as in Hinayana Buddhism) then art is also impossible. Secondly is the place of myth, which along with metaphysics is unessential and pre- vious to intuition. Art, which is on the way to intuition of truth, is important as a participation in truth and being, and thus is a religious manifestation in its own right. Thirdly, the members of the Buddhist pantheon, all having particular functions because of their power and position to help people in cult and devotion, lend themselves naturally to pictorial representation. As East Asian Mahayana Buddhism contains all thinkable types of reli- gion, from the highest philosophical knowledge-intuition and mystical vision-down to superstition, so also its art contains a plenitude of figures of different spiritual meaning and range, not found elsewhere in the sacred art of the world. Two more points favored the development of Mahaydna art. First was the Buddhist cosmology, according to which the baneful influence of Kharma and the helping influence of Buddha are both immanent in all beings, in the smallest impulses and conse- quences, influencing the salvation or damnation of all the world. Secondly was the limited ego, helpless in the face of Kharma and needing help from above for the attainment of enlightenment. The individual gained help when his religious imagination re- reived help from the pantheon of mediatory beings. Herein lies the importance of the cult images, the rites, symbols and figures, which gave artists ideas and tasks for their work. Another reason for the great proliferation of pictorial re- presentation in Buddhism was its immense power of adaptation to the religious situation within which it found itself. Since the pantheon and all symbolic representations were steps on the way, and not the goal, a great variety could be taken up. Moreover there was a necessity for this concrete representation. Mahayana Buddhism differed radically from Hinayana in this point, that it brought to the religious consciousness a "person-like mystic hypostasis of the absolute and forms of its development or mani- festation toward which the fajithful can turn in loving trust and cultic veneration.... " This pictorial representation, to which the faithful consider themselves identical in contemplative vision, helps themn very much, because in each one's self, even if it be</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 233 hidden like a seed, is the Buddha-nature of all being, which will be understood and realized. This realization is Nirvana (an "empty" situation of enlightenment beyond all names and forms), which is the Absolute. The Absolute, although beyond names and forms, is manifested and partly understood in the concrete. Accordingly, in those figures of salvation (Heilsgestalten), of which the principal is Buddha, there follows a person-like (per- sonhafte) incarnation of the Absolute which not only allows an "I-thou" relationship, imagination and representation, but really requires them. In a short historical treatment, Seckel answers two questions: if there was a necessity for symbolic and pictorial representation inherent in Mahayana, who then commissioned the works of art, and where were they produced? Tracing the history from its principal source in monastery schools of several Chinese sects, all in contact with India, he divides the Buddhist art of East Asia into four main types, designated by Japanese historical periods: the foundation (Suiko to Nara periods); the scholastic-mystic period (Heian period); the period of faith in Amida (Fujiwara); and finally the time of the upsurge of Zen (Kamakura-Muromachi periods). As Zen is unique in the history of Buddhism and its art, it receives a special treatment at the end of the book. In treating of particular manifestations of Buddhist art, Prof. Seckel gives a direction, and not the last word. Chapters follow concerning iconography, architecture, sculpture, painting, and other minor forms of art. A number of valuable observations are made which if followed by the organizers of art exhibits, would do away with the artificial romanticism so prevalent in "tasteful" exhibitions, and the distortion of signification gained by false viewing of art objects. For instance, one should never view group statues in isolation, but always in relation to the others. Single figures are outside the main stream of Buddhist art. More- over, statues should be looked at only from a frontal position. In Seckel's treatment of the monastery we find another cardinal point for understanding the significance of Buddhist forms. Inside an East-Asian temple room the effect is opposite to that found in a mosque or church. It is not an assembly hall of a congregation (at least, when it does occur it is a late develop- ment), but is rather a place to set the cult images, a chapel for veneration, rites and meditation. It is essentially ordered not to man, but to a pictorial representation of the Absolute. Therefore the "congregation" on feast days is placed in the temple court,</page><page sequence="5">234 Reviews outside. The important point is that this too, along with the temple grounds, pagoda, etc. is a representation of the Absolute, a place in which a mystery shines forth, as do the cult figures in the deep darkness of the twilight temple interiors. Buddhist art, springing from the doctrines of Mahayana, must solve this problem: to show forth the invisible in a visible form, and at the same time, allow the visible forms to transcend the merely visible by four means. These means are symbolism, the decorative character of the works, the manifestation of the vision, and abstraction. This abstraction is a dialectic between the spiritual and sensual to arrive at some synthesis of both. When the art was anthropomorphic, the interest in divinity was low. But even when there was a certain realism (as in the Japa- nese portrait statues of famous monks) or aesthetic beauty, the intention of the artist was different. It is dangerous to attribute our Western motives to a Buddhist artist. One function of the Buddhist works of art was their action as a symbol of the whole universe. Another was "pardnetisch", the propagation of the faith, and to form a basis for memory and living tradition. Not least among the functions was to provide pictures for the Buddhist cult, as a starting point for veneration and meditation (if we look at it from below, subjectively, with regard to the spectator), and a symbol and representation from above (looked at objectively). The picture is never a mere picture, but an instrument to lift the ideas of men. In a historical treatment of changes in style, the author emphasizes that these changes in a single artist and in history do not correspond to changes in the Western sense. This again is a point to take into consideration when treating of the meta- morphosis of Japanese painting, to understand the eclecticism one finds so often in the history of Japanese art. Prof. Seckel concludes this tightly composed work with a chapter devoted to Zen and its arts: ikebana, cha-no-yu, ink- painting, iconography and architecture. The cardinal principle therein is that dogma and art are unimportant for the monk and disciple. So a new approach results when one comes to take them up without being influenced by them. The attitude is stated thus: "One doesn't care, therefore he is free to do these things"-with a greater freedom of approach. Not the least attractive feature of the book is its handsome bibliography. It is broad and analytical, covering all the fields mentioned in the book, from Buddhism in general, translated</page><page sequence="6">Reviews 235 Buddhist texts, Buddhist manifestations in various parts of the Orient with their concomitant artistic products (divided geo- graphically), down to the more particularized fields of architec- ture, iconography and the like. Besides a number of sketches illustrating specific points in the text, two maps are included at the end. The numerous photographs of art objects and their details, placed at the end, for informational, not aesthetic pur- poses, each have a section in the notes reserved for their explana- tion. A historico-chronological table of China, Korea and Japan is found at the end of particularly complete notes. In summary, this book provides the work of orientation of the field which makes it a classic of its type. It is not the book to be placed on the shelves of the dilettante. But for anyone seriously interested in the fields of Oriental art it is a most penetrating and well-ordered analysis of the elements and under- lying spirit of East-Asian Buddhist art. The author is to be thanked for dispensing with a plethora of unessential detail for the sake of preserving the clarity of his aim. One might quibble with him for relying heavily on translated texts and secondary sources (at least arguing from his notes and bibliography), but in such a global approach, presenting the work exclusively for a European audience, there is little choice in the matter. One could not ask more from a really working bibliography. Prof. Seckel had set before himself the goal of ordering a particularly vast and unruly material, of providing a rough map for the use of future Western students of the field. One hates to use the cliche, "This is destined to be the standard work of its type", but such really has to be said of this admirable addition to Oriental studies. We look forward to more of its type, especially the historical work hinted at in the beginning of this book. Joseph P. Love, S.J.</page></plain_text>
