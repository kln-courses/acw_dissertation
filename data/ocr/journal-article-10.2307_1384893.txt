<plain_text><page sequence="1">Comment Which Way the Future? A Critique of Glock's "Images of God" and Fenn's "New Sociology of Religion" THOMAS R. McFAUL Department of Sociology and Anthropology Mount Union College Charles Y. Glock's article, "Images of God and Man," in the March, 1972 issue of this journal, and Richard K. Fenn's article, "Toward a New Sociology of Reli- gion," in the same issue, set forth stimulating and alternative approaches to scien- tific inquiry into religious phenomena. The sociology of religion for a long time has been witness to considerable controversy over the question of how to define and understand religious behavior. These two articles contain in miniature some of these divergences. The purpose of Fenn's article is to argue for a position that social differentiation and cultural pluralism diminish the likelihood of pressures toward cultural uniform- ity. His polemic is directed especially toward those who would contend that reli- gion functions as the mainstay of cultural integration. Automated technologies and a highly differentiated division of labor militate against pressures toward cultural uniformity. Instead, they fragment the culture into discrete and pluralistic clusters of value, each with limited scope and influence. Given this situation, there is little chance that traditional religious symbols will provide the basis of integration for whole societies (pp. 18-21). Differentiation undermines once and for all the integrative power not only of traditional religious values and symbols, but of all other values and symbols as well. In this way, Fenn denies the possibility that any "functional alternative" to religion could furnish the basis of total societal integration. He sums up the fate of religious beliefs in modern society this way: "The effects of pluralism and the mass media combine to reduce beliefs to opinions and matters of ultimate commitment to mat- ters of personal preference. Pressures toward uniformity are therefore highly. ana- chronistic and unsuccessful" (p. 21). What is the future of religion in such a society? First of all, Fenn states that "a point of no return has been reached in which religious change may occur quite 231</page><page sequence="2">232 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION independently of changes in the rest of the social system. Change in religious sym- bolization, that is, may develop without any impact on other areas of society" (p. 17). In short, religion is being shoved to the periphery of the social system. Its influence is at best marginal, and its main function is expressive. It helps individuals "maintain their boundaries with society" (p. 19). It may continue to function to relieve boredom and foster "human relations" experiments or interpersonal activi- ties, but it has little relevance in relationship to the legitimation of its host social system. The types of religious organizations most likely to prosper in a highly different- iated social environment are the introversionist, spiritualist, quietist types. In effect, religion becomes a form of compensatory reaction to the strains of modern life. Religion in modern society then fosters "the disengagement of the individ- ual's deepest motivations and highest values from the areas of political and eco- nomic action" (p. 31). The consequence of this is that cultural integration is in no way contingent upon inputs from religious beliefs and values. If the integration of modern society no longer depends on shared religious values, then what does it depend on? How does modem society legitimate itself? It is precisely at this point that Fenn's discussion becomes problematical. The logic of his argument begins in his assertion that legitimacy "depends on effect- iveness in meeting basic human needs" (p. 27). But he retreats from defining what these needs are and the extent to which they may be created artificially through culture or exist innately as a part of physiological endowment. The United States is not without some source of social integration. Fenn writes, "Americans may no longer be able to agree on ultimate ends or on what is worth doing, but only on what is feasible or 'appropriate"' (p. 18). As his thought pro- ceeds from the general to the more specific, he asserts, "If there is any significant degree of cultural integration in American society, . . . it may only be on the level of pragmatic interests and utilitarian norms" (p. 18). These pragmatic and utili- tarian norms are related to the demands of the political and economic market- place. . . . pressures toward uniformity in values are likely to be greatest when the values are di- rectly relevant to the performance of certain tasks or to the achievement of particular goals, as in the case of equality in the conditions of education and employment. In modernized soci- eties with increasing degrees of equality, however, with institutionalized pluralism and multi- ple group memberships, pressures toward uniformity, if they are present at all, are likely to be limited to achieving agreement on the facts relevant to political or to economic decision making. The critical question for modern societies, then, is the rate at which it can meet the demands of its citizens for equality. [p. 22] Those men who hold positions of power must base their claims of legitimacy upon the extent to which they are effective in meeting these demands for equality. Here, then, is the basis of legitimacy in modern society: "Neither religious nor moral values, but duly established priorities, effectiveness, and propriety become the primary sources of legitimacy" (p. 28). Coupled with this basis of legitimacy in society is the transformation of ultimate concerns into preoccupation with prop- er administration and management.</page><page sequence="3">CRITIQUE OF GLOCK AND FENN 233 Glock's perspective on religious behavior differs considerably from that of Fenn. In the "superstructure vs. substructure" debate, as exemplified in the writings of Max Weber and Karl Marx, Glock considers himself an ally of Max Weber. He supports Weber's contention that ideological changes precede rather than follow changes in social organization. Glock acknowledges that all social structure has ideological rootage. Ideas function to guide men in the construction of economic, political, and other social structures. Glock's understanding of the relationship of ideas to social structure is expressed succinctly in the following: Ideas are important not only to the invention of a form of social organization but to war- ranting it. No form of social organization can evolve unless it can be made acceptable to those who are obliged to live under it. Acceptance of a sort may be achieved by force and oppres- sion. . . . But, to survive over the long rather than the short run, social organization requires the acquiescence of its constituents. [p. 2] Following these general propositions, Glock then expands his views of the cen- trality of ideas for social organization, so that they have direct utility for the soci- ology of religion. "The organization of social life is importantly related to the pre- vailing imagery about 'god' and imagery about man" (pp. 3-4). His definition of "god" is not limited to some form of theocentrism. Imageries of god may take many forms: an "other-worldly force," "anthropomorphic," "eternal principles or laws of creation," or even those "which deny the supernatural," such as Marxism or mod- ern science (p. 4). What is significant about Glock's use of the word "god" is that he attaches it to the central ideas and imageries upon which the normative dimensions and role patterns of any society are constructed. These central ideas serve many functions. Most importantly, they give life purpose and supply it with meaning. Furthermore, the ideas of god "always imply an image of what man is like" (p. 4). And they pro- claim the sacredness of the social order. They attempt to define the scope of man's activities, that is, what kinds of social activities are considered worthwhile in rela- tionship to the sacredness of the social order. With this further refinement in definition, Glock's general hypothesis about the saliency of ideas for social organization can be stated in a specific form applicable to the sociology of religion. "When prevailing ideas about 'god' and the nature of man change, the form of social organization can also be expected to change, some- times profoundly so" (p. 4). The remainder of the article consists of weaving together three major themes: 1) the historical role played by the four major imageries of god and man: Cathol- icism, Protestantism, Marxism, and modern science. It is upon the last of these four that Glock bases his analysis of social disorganization within present day Am- erica; 2) the function of these imageries in legitimizing and rationalizing as well as delegitimizing social inequality and its concomitant mechanisms of social control, sanctions and compensations; 3) the role of modern science, especially the debate between "free-will" and "determinism," in altering the fundamental ideas by which modern man understands himself and upon which his social organization and pat- terns of reward distribution are based.</page><page sequence="4">234 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION The next and final step in Glock's discussion focuses upon the lack of wide- spread consensus within present day America and the role modem science has played in the erosion of the once broadly accepted anthropomorphic, hard-work oriented imageries of god and man. The impact of science upon the eclipse of be- lief in free will is manifest in the drift toward the welfare state, antipoverty pro- grams and changed criminal law orientations, which do not hold the insane respons- ible for their crimes. While the old imageries recede, new ones have not yet emerged to provide a basis for widespread consensus. The rise of pluralism, student unrest, the public response to the Vietnam war, concern over protection of the environment, women's liberation, all reflect the demise of the old imageries and competition among the new. Perhaps one day scientific knowledge will define the precise parameters of free will and determinism in human behavior and thereby provide an intellect- ual and scholarly basis for a new consensus. Until such a time, what modem society can expect, Glock says, "with increased diffusion and internalization of scientific perspectives is the erosion of old imageries and the social structures they support accompanied by an extended period of social disintegration as men, with different visions of what scientific understanding implies for social organization, struggle for power" (p. 12). These two articles present very different points of view on the subject of religi- ous behavior. When Glock addresses himself to the question of "god" or "man" or religion in general, he is referring specifically to those salient and highly generalized ideas and norms which motivate the actions of persons within the social system. He is talking about those central values and perceptions of reality around which people form their basic commitments and upon which they justify their daily activities, in all spheres of social life. Unlike Fenn, he is not referring to those imageries and forms of organization that exist at the periphery of the social system. What lie at the bases of the differences between Glock's and Fenn's articles are alternative ways of perceiving and defining religious phenomena. Glock focuses upon those ideas without which a social system would cease to have an identity. Fenn concentrates upon religious phenomena as only marginally related to the main operations of modern society. Glock's understanding of religious behavior is in- clusive; Fenn's is exclusive. Fenn's usage is restricted to traditional theocentric belief systems, while Glock's embraces nontheocentric systems as well. Glock's article acknowledges explicitly that the normative systems which lie at the basis of any social system contain a particular view of reality, a set of assumptions con- cerning "god" and "man." These perceptions have specific implications for social organization. In stating this somewhat differently, one would say that all men pos- sess an "ontology." They all see the world from their particular perspectives; and what they see they really believe to be there. By whatever nomenclature, all men possess a perspective on life, a world view, a perception of being. What is crucial in Glock's article is the extent to which theocentric or non- theocentric ideas about god and man serve to integrate entire social systems. The main deficiency of Glock's article is its failure to acknowledge the possibility that modern industrialized societies may continue to remain pluralistic indefinitely.</page><page sequence="5">CRITIQUE OF GLOCK AND FENN 235 They may never again become normatively or cognitively monolithic nor neces- sarily integrated around any one particular set of sacred beliefs. Science, which Glock perceives as the potential foundation for a newly integrated social order, is but one among many systems of sacred beliefs competing for men's allegiances. Perhaps future industrial societies will continue being pluralistic. To borrow Glock's terminology, contemporary as well as future society will probably be char- acterized by competition among the "gods." Modem society may become increas- ingly "poly-god-centered" rather than "mono-god-centered." Acknowledgement of the possibility of continuing pluralism is one of the main strengths of Fenn's article. At the same time, Fenn's discussion is itself confusing because he introduces through the back door a new set of values while simultane- ously kicking out the front door any set of values which might function to integrate a highly pluralistic and differentiated modern society. It is misleading for him to assert that "Neither religious nor moral values, but duly established priorities, effectiveness, and propriety become the primary sources of legitimacy," for if the establishment of priorities is not based upon the goals people conceive to be mor- ally urgent, then what is it based on? If 'pragmatic interests and utilitarian norms" are not value commitments, then what are they? If modem society has set as one of its goals the establishment of equality, has it not thereby given priority to a value standard that defines appropriate policy objectives in broad sectors of life? In Glock's terms, is there not at least an implicit view of "god" and "man" in such assertions? Most sociologists would probably find it hard to conceive of pragmatic and utilitarian orientations toward social behavior as anything but value commit- ments in their own right. Efficiency, managerial rationality, and efforts to control all reflect value commitments. There are, after all, alternatives to these types of social organization. In Glock's terms, these commitments are part of some "religi- ous" system, irrespective of whether or not they are theocentrically grounded. If Fenn is right that the critical question for modem societies is the rate at which they can meet demands of their citizens for equality, then cannot sociologists continue to assert that the integration of these societies depends on their ability to imple- ment commonly held values? Both Fenn and Glock raise many questions that can only be answered empir- ically. For example, at what point are one or more subsystems within the larger society in a position to threaten the system if they do not believe they are receiving their "equal share" of the distribution of opportunities and rewards, as they define the situation from their life-perspective? Also, to what extent do pragmatic and utilitarian norms cut across subcultural perspectives? And furthermore, to what extent does commitment to scientific process and discovery inform these varying subcultures and lie at the basis of a commitment to pragmatic and utilitarian norma- tive orientations? These questions embody the theocentric and nontheocentric, scientific and pluralistic concerns of both Glock's and Fenn's articles. The demand for equality may turn out to be a highly generalized norm which has its basis in scientific-pragmatic values, which cut across all subsystems and serve to inte- grate the society to the extent that it becomes manifest at the institutional level. Thus there could be more integration at the normative level than might be readily</page><page sequence="6">236 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION apparent. Modern social systems with their highly differentiated division of labor and correspondingly pluralistic value systems might be able to handle considerable change, as long as that change reflects greater movement toward genuine equality and pluralism. Diversity plus equity in the distribution of life chances need not necessarily be inherently contradictory or socially incompatible. However, these are issues that can only be resolved empirically. Glock's and Fenn's articles are both stimulating and challenging because they lift into high relief some of the antinomies that have historically divided sociologists of religion and which still generate considerable intellectual heat among scholars who inter- pret "religious" behavior through different definitional frames. This is why the questions pertaining to religious ideas and values and their re- lationship to social integration are in the final analysis empirical ones. Fenn ac- knowledges the existence of pluralism but seems to suggest that the demise of traditional religious values and cognitive perspectives, which once functioned as the basis for normative integration, means that values will have little to do with major policy decisions, and that pragmatism and utilitarianism reflect no values of any sort. Glock acknowledges the central role of value orientations within broader religious systems and of their importance for policy formulations. But he fails to couch his discussion of the role of the scientific subculture more explicitly within the context of what might be permanent pluralism for contemporary and future society. It should be clear by now that despite some very basic differences there is one important area where these two articles overlap. Both Glock and Fenn are talking about values and the part they play in human societies. They differ sharply in the way they define religion, but in the last analysis they are both talking about values. Despite wide differences of opinion among sociologists on the question of how re- ligion ought to be defined, most of them would agree that religion does involve value orientations and that the same analytical tools used to study values grounded in theistic convictions can be used to study those grounded in nontheistic convic- tions. Sociologists will probably continue to argue over whose definition of religion is to be preferred. However, the really critical disagreements between Glock and Fenn concern how values operate in modem society, and these disagreements can only be resolved by empirical research.</page></plain_text>
