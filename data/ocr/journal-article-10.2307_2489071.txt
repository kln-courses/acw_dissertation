<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Examination of Consumer Decision Making for a Common Repeat Purchase Product WAYNE D. HOYER* Despite the large amount of theory and research on consumer choice, current understanding is still at a less than desirable level-especially in the cases where involvement with or importance of the choice is low and the product is purchased frequently. The present paper provides a view of decision making based on the notion that consumers are not motivated to engage in a great deal of in-store decision making at the time of purchase when the product is purchased repeatedly and is relatively unimportant. As a result, consumers tend to apply very simple choice rules or tactics that provide a satisfactory choice while allowing a quick and effortless decision. An empirical test of this proposition is provided and implications are discussed. n recent years, a considerable amount of effort has been devoted to understanding the processes by which consumers arrive at some type of decision (usually a purchase). A large portion of this research has focused on two basic aspects: information acqui- sition (e.g., Bettman and Park 1980; Jacoby 1977; Russo and Rosen 1975) and information integration (e.g., Ryan and Bonfield 1975; Wilkie and Pessemier 1973; Wright 1975). Despite the attention this topic has received, a large portion of the variance in con- sumer choice has yet to be explained (Kassarjian 1978). Although broad generalizations can be made regarding choice processes, our ability to predict and understand this behavior is still at a less than desirable level. The present paper is an attempt to account for some of this unexplained variance. CONSUMER DECISION PROCESSES Although a number of specific explanations for the shortcomings of consumer decision research can be generated, the present paper focuses on two major aspects. First, researchers have tended to apply decision models which have been borrowed from other areas of inquiry (e.g., social psychology, economics, and cognitive psychology). The problem is that these mod- els were developed to understand processes in situa- tions which elicit a considerable degree of cognitive effort and commitment. For example, the widely employed Fishbein model (Fishbein 1963, 1967) was developed to understand social attitudes of major importance to individuals. Some authors, however, have suggested that many common product decisions may not be that important or involving to consumers (e.g., Hupfer and Gardner 1971; Kassarjian 1978). One must therefore question whether these models are accurate representations of how decisions are made for a variety of decision contexts. Indeed, Wright (1975) states that certain decision strategies require a considerable degree of cognitive effort which the consumer may be unwilling to expend. Thus, when examining these decision con- texts, a driving issue is the extent to which consumers engage in processing that is consistent with traditional models of consumer choice (e.g., compensatory or noncompensatory models), or whether some other form of processing occurs. Second, much of the research on consumer decision making has focused on cognitive processing that occurs immediately prior to the act of purchase (or selection). Yet many decisions are made repeatedly or frequently over time and thus involve continuous-as opposed to discrete-processing (Hogarth 1981). In these in- stances, consumers may rely not only on previously acquired product information stored in memory, but also on judgments of brand satisfaction or dissatisfac- tion which occur in the post-purchase evaluation (or usage) stage of the decision process. In addition, consumers may engage in other types of processing outside the immediate choice context. For example, * Wayne D.

JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH * Vol. 11 0 December 1984</page><page sequence="2">COMMON PRODUCT DECISION MAKING 823 consumers may decide to choose a product based on knowledge from an advertisement or because of a coupon acquisition. Again, one must question whether traditional models of consumer choice adequately explain processing in these types of situations. AN ALTERNATIVE VIEW In light of these two issues, Deshpande et al. (1982) proposed a view which attempts to describe consumer decision making in situations that involve repeated purchases over time and that can be typically consid- ered as low in importance or involvement. This per- spective is based on the notion that "when purchase behavior is preceded by a choice process, it is likely to be very limited" (Olshavsky and Granbois 1979, p. 99). It assumes that the major goal in repetitive and relatively unimportant decisions is not to make an "optimal" choice but, rather, to make a satisfactory choice while minimizing cognitive effort. It therefore postulates that consumers optimize time and effort as opposed to consequences (Einhorn and Hogarth 1981). This emphasis on effort is the result of three major factors: 1. These decisions are not important enough to indi- viduals and do not involve a degree of risk large enough to warrant significant decision making effort. 2. Consumers have made these decisions numerous times in the past and thus do not need to expend a great deal of decision making effort. 3. A typical shopping trip involves numerous decisions, and it is likely that the consumer does not want to expend a great deal of time and effort on any one decision. Preliminary support for the concept of reduced cog- nitive effort in these types of situations is provided in a study of Deshpande and Hoyer (1983), in which it was found that consumers exerted considerably less effort in choosing peanut butter than in choosing a pair of running shoes and an automobile. Consistent with this notion are Wright's (1975) findings that certain decision strategies-especially those which "optimize" the decision-require a considerable degree of cognitive effort, and that in some cases, a strategy may be chosen because of its "simplifying" potential. Thus it is postulated that consumers employ very simple choice heuristics or tactics when making repeat decisions which are relatively low in importance or involvement.' These tactics are rules of thumb which allow consumers to make a very quick and effortless decision. For example, tactics could be related to price (e.g., "buy the cheapest brand" or "buy the brand on sale"), performance ("buy the brand which works the best"), affect ("buy the most pleasing brand"), or normative factors ("buy the same brand my mother buys;" Deshpande et al. 1982). It is important to note that these tactics are even more simple and involve less effort than many of the heuristics already suggested in the consumer literature (Bettman 1979; Engel and Blackwell 1983). The notion of decision heuristics is not new to consumer research. However, a choice tactic approach differs distinctly from previous models in the process of tactic development. Most of the previous approaches assume that cognitive evaluation of the evoked set is performed prior to each choice (i.e., a discrete process; Hogarth 1981); but a choice tactic view. assumes that since purchase (or choice) occurs fairly often, evalua- tion occurs over a repeated number of trials (or purchase occasions). This focus on processing over trials distinguishes the present approach from more traditional simplifying heuristics (e.g., the lexicographic model). In the process of tactic development, initial choices may be either haphazard, based on the modeling of others (e.g., "buy what my friends or parents buy"), or constructed at the time of the choice (Bettman and Zins 1977). Also, the familiarity which results from passive exposure to advertisements may play an im- portant role in the early stages of choice tactic devel- opment. Over time, however, consumers refine their tactics until a satisfactory decision can be made with very little effort. For example, a consumer might initially employ the tactic "buy the cheapest brand." If this results in a satisfactory choice, this tactic will have an increased probability of being employed on the next purchase occasion. Alternatively, consumers might purchase the same brand on subsequent occa- sions to minimize the cognitive effort associated with checking all the prices. If an unsatisfactory choice results, the consumer might then employ a more refined or stringent rule, such as "buy the cheapest national brand," or use another tactic altogether. It is recognized that brand choice may occur as the result of a brand evaluation process. But in contrast to the traditional view, which assumes that this eval- uation is developed at the moment of choice, the choice tactic view suggests that an evaluation may occur if the product is perceived to be satisfactory (or unsatisfactory) when it is used (i.e., at the post- purchase evaluation stage). Thus the consumer still does not engage in extensive processing; rather, s/he relies on a simple judgment which is acquired over time. It should also be mentioned that two familiar con- cepts in the consumer behavior literature-habitual purchase and brand loyalty-are easily incorporated into this framework. Habitual purchase would consist of the continued use of the tactic "buy the same brand I bought last time." As Jacoby and Kyner (1973) point out, habitual purchase is not necessarily the result of a strong positive brand evaluation. The ' It must be noted that consumers may also apply these very simple rules in very complex and involving tasks, but discussion here is limited to the low-involvement situation.</page><page sequence="3">824 THE JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH habitual purchaser does not engage in repeat purchase because of a strong preference for the brand; rather, repeat purchasing represents a convenient way of reducing cognitive effort. Brand loyalty involves a preference for the brand. This preference probably results from a post-purchase evaluation of product performance in which the con- sumer perceives that the brand satisfies needs better than do existing alternatives. Thus, habitual and brand- loyal consumers possess different motivations for the same behavior, and any effort to change these behaviors would involve a different strategy (e.g., altering habit vs. changing brand preference). The basic point is that-through a series of trials which involve either positive, negative, or neutral experiences-the post-purchase evaluation will stabi- lize and consumers will come to possess a set of very simple decision heuristics. That is, consumers acquire a set of choice tactics which are learned over time. These tactics make it unnecessary for the consumer to engage in extended cognitive processing each time a decision is made; all that is required is the application of the simple rule of thumb. This enables the consumer to minimize cognitive effort and still make a satisfac- tory choice. Support for this view is provided by Hogarth (1981), who states that in continuous contexts, decision makers apply simple heuristics and "adjust" these rules on the basis of outcome feedback. EXAMINING CHOICE TACTICS The main thrust of the present study is that choice tactics make it unnecessary to engage in extended cognitive effort in any given purchase situation. If decision making is examined at any one point in time, the process is very likely to be very limited-involving only the application of a choice tactic. The purpose of the present study is to examine both the degree and the type of processing that occurs when consumers are making a choice for a common, frequently pur- chased, and typically low-involvement product. In examining these issues, however, an important meth- odological issue arises. Many of the previous studies examining the con- sumer choice process have employed methodologies which are obtrusive. In some instances, this obtrusive- ness occurs because the measurement technique struc- tures the problem for the consumer. (Examples include compensatory models and conjoint measurement.) Given that decision makers are highly responsive to task structure variables (Bettman 1979), there is a potential for the "true" decision process to be obscured. Further, with many of the decision process techniques, consumers are well aware that their behavior is being observed, and this may alter their responses due to reactivity of measurement (Cook and Campbell 1979). In addition, many techniques rely heavily on detailed verbal reports, and as Wells and Lo Scuito (1966) and Jacoby (1977) report, what consumers say they do (on the basis of verbal responses) may not agree with what they actually do (under direct observation). One data collection technique which may partially overcome these problems is that of direct, in-store observation. Wells and Lo Scuito (1966) suggest that this technique provides a more accurate view of con- sumer behavior because it allows the consumer to behave without as much interference from the re- searcher and because it does not rely on the consumer's ability to interpret a question or remember an event. In the present study, consumers were unobtrusively observed while making a repetitive, low-involvement purchase. This was done to gain a clearer picture of how the choice process proceeds in a natural, in-store environment. Particularly important was an exami- nation of the degree of decision effort (measured in terms of the amount of information search and time taken). Then, by supplementing natural observation with a simple questioning technique, an attempt was made to determine the type of choice strategy consu- mers used while making their decisions. METHOD Subjects A total of 120 subjects was interviewed in three major chain grocery stores in a metropolitan area. These stores were selected to provide a typical sample of consumers living in the city (in terms of social class, age, and race). Subjects were interviewed in three major parts of the day (morning, afternoon, and evening) across all three stores to reduce biases due to shopping environment and time period (Wells and Lo Scuito 1966). Every consumer who entered a supermarket aisle (when the experimenter was free) was approached immediately after having selected a brand of laundry detergent. All age categories (over 18) were represented: the 25-34-year-old group was the most common (35 percent), followed by 45-54 (19 percent) and 35-44 (18 percent). About 80 percent of the subjects were female, 72 percent were white, 16 percent were black, and 10 percent were Hispanic. The subjects had been purchasing laundry detergent from one to 61 years, with a mean of about 19 years. The number of brands each consumer had purchased ranged from one to 15, with a mean of about five. Each potential subject was offered a 25-cent coupon good on any brand of laundry detergent. This appears to have been an adequate incentive, since only 10 of the 130 consumers approached declined to participate. Choice Task Laundry detergent was selected as the choice task for several reasons.2 First, detergent is clearly a repeat 2 The examination of only one product category poses limitations on the ability to draw conclusions. This fact will be discussed at more length in a later section.</page><page sequence="4">COMMON PRODUCT DECISION MAKING 825 purchase product that appears to be similar to generally recognized low-involvement products (e.g., Lastovicka and Gardner 1979; Rothschild 1979). Second, deter- gent was found to possess a very low level of perceived risk in a pre-test. Third, there is a wide variety of brands available, which might enhance the number and variety of tactics that consumers could employ. Fourth, large laundry detergent displays are common in supermarkets. It would be difficult to observe search behavior in front of a very small display. Assessment of the Search and Decision Process Consumers were carefully observed by a single experimenter (who was naive to the purpose of the study) as they were making their laundry detergent purchase.3 The observer appeared to be a store em- ployee who was taking inventory. Since the observer stood behind and slightly to the side of the shopper as the choice was being made, consumers appeared to be unaware that they were being observed while they were searching. The very large size of the laundry detergent display greatly facilitated the recording of information search behavior, since fairly substantial movement was required to examine different brands. An observation chart was developed which mirrored the laundry detergent display in each store and which was used to record each subject's behavior as s/he made a brand selection. A coding system was also developed which allowed the interviewer to record the search process easily. When a package was examined, a line was drawn next to that brand and size package on the chart. If the package was picked up, a circle was drawn around the line. An "X" was made through the circle for the package selected for purchase. The amount of time (in seconds) spent examining each package was placed next to the other markings. If a shelf tag was examined, a circle was made along the line representing the shelf at the point where the tag was located. The major dependent variables of interest included the number of packages examined, the total amount of time taken, the time taken for the chosen brand, the number of cross-brand comparisons (i.e., exam- ining different brands), the number of within-brand comparisons (i.e., examining different sizes within brands), and the number of shelf tags examined. The latter four measures represent rough approximations, given the difficulty of acquiring detailed in-store ob- servations of in-store brand choice behaviors. Assessment of Choice Tactics Upon completion of choice, consumers were ap- proached by the experimenter and offered a 25-cent coupon for the brand they purchased in return for participating in the study. A 12-question instrument was then administered to assess several aspects of consumers' laundry detergent purchases. Choice tactics used by consumers were measured two ways. First, consumers were asked to tell the interviewer why they made their laundry detergent purchase. Specifically, consumers were asked, "Can you tell me why you selected the brand you have chosen?" This open- ended question was intended to elicit an immediate post-decision response concerning the way the chosen brand had been selected. This question was strictly "free response" with an absence of probes, to allow consumers to describe their choice process in their own terms. It was felt that more detailed questioning would have been too obtrusive. Later in the interview, subjects were presented with a list of 10 possible choice tactics from which they were asked to select the one that best represented the way their decision had been made that day. The selection of these tactics was based on data acquired in an earlier study. Multiple measures of the choice tactic variable were included to provide greater con- fidence in reported findings. Thus the purpose of such closed questions was to provide an additional "check" on the type of tactic employed. Other variables of interest were product class ex- perience, brand loyalty, perceived influence of in-store factors, perceived influence of out-of-store factors, and demographics. Product class experience was measured with two questions. Subjects were asked how long they had been purchasing laundry detergent and how many brands they had purchased. Brand experience was also measured by asking how long the subject had been purchasing the brand s/he had selected on the day of the interview. Both of these variables were measured on seven-point scales ranging from 1 (0-3 years) to 7 (over 40 years). Both the repeated purchase and the affective aspects of brand loyalty were mea- sured by asking subjects to rate their frequency of purchasing the chosen brand (on a six-point scale ranging from always purchased to never purchased) and the strength of preference for that brand (on a five-point scale ranging from very strong preference to very weak preference). The perceived influence of in-store situational factors was assessed on several three-point scales that ranged from a lot of attention to no attention. Subjects were asked how much attention they paid to sale signs, shelf tags, end-of-aisle and point-of-purchase displays, and package information other than the price. In addition, as mentioned previously, attention to in- store factors was coded as part of the observational data. Two questions determined the influence of factors outside the store. Influence of advertising on subjects' laundry detergent decisions was measured on a three- point scale ranging from a lot of influence to no influence. It is recognized that this measure is some- 3 It should be mentioned that the observer was carefully trained in the conducting of the experiment and also engaged in five "practice" observations before actual data were collected.</page><page sequence="5">826 THE JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH TABLE 1 SUMMARY OF SEARCH DATA Frequency distribution proportions Variable Mean Median 0 1 2 3 4 5 Number of packages examined 1.42 1.19 .00 .72 .18 .07 .02 .02 Number of packages picked up 1.23 1.10 .00 .83 .13 .02 .01 .01 Number of across-brand comparisons .45 .17 .74 .17 .01 .07 .02 .00 Number of within-brand comparisons .07 .03 .95 .03 .02 .00 .00 .00 Number of shelf tags examined .13 .06 .89 .08 .03 .00 .00 .00 Frequency distribution seconds 1-10 11-20 21-30 31-40 40 Time per brand 7.72 4.77 .86 .10 .03 .01 .00 Total time 13.16 8.49 .75 .10 .08 .01 .06 NOTE: N = 120. what simplistic; however, the focus of the present study was not a detailed examination of advertising influence. Subjects were also asked if they had a coupon for the brand they had selected. The final questions covered demographic variables such as family size, education, and age. The interviewer also observed whether the subject was shopping alone or with others, as well as the subject's sex and race. The interviewer read each question to the subject. Subjects were given cards with the possible answers to the multiple-choice questions in order to speed up the interview process and to aid subjects in answering the questions. The interview generally took three to four minutes to complete. RESULTS Information Search The first area of interest concerned the extent of information search and the amount of time taken while making a laundry detergent choice. Table 1 presents summary data for the observation-based search categorization. Consumers examined a very small number of packages (X = 1.42, median = 1.19). According to the frequency distribution, 72 percent of the consumers looked at only one package, and only 11 percent looked at more than two. An even lower number of packages was actually picked up (X = 1.23, median = 1.10): 83 percent of the consumers picked up only one package, and only 4 percent picked up more than two. Given that consumers must examine at least one package in order to make a choice, it is clear that in- store pre-purchase evaluation was almost nonexistent. This is further supported by the finding that extremely few across-brand and within-brand (i.e., size) compar- isons were made (X = 0.45 and 0.07, respectively). Further, these means are as high as they are because of several outliers. Finally, only a very small number of shelf tags was examined. Consumers took an average of 13 seconds from the time they entered the aisle to complete their in-store decision. Given that the laundry detergent display spans an entire aisle, it takes consumers some amount of time to arrive in the physical proximity of their desired brand. When one considers that the time taken to locate the brand is included in the overall time estimate, it is obvious that the typical consumer is making an extremely quick decision with only a minimal degree of cognitive effort in the store envi- ronment. This finding is given further support by the fact that a majority of the time taken (median = 4.77) was devoted to the chosen brand. In summary, the data from the present study present clear evidence that a majority of consumers engage in very little pre-purchase deliberation when making a laundry detergent purchase. Given this, the next ques- tion concerns the nature of this brief decision process. Consumer Usage of Choice Tactics Immediately following their choices, consumers were approached and asked how they had made their pur- chases. If consumers use simplified heuristics, this should be reflected in their free responses to the open- ended question.</page><page sequence="6">COMMON PRODUCT DECISION MAKING 827 TABLE 2 RESPONSES TO OPEN-ENDED CHOICE TACTIC QUESTION Total number of Response consumers Percentage Price tactics 27 22.5 Cheapest 18 15.0 Coupon 5 4.2 Use less so costs less 3 2.5 On sale 1 0.8 Affect tactics 24 20.0 Like it 20 16.7 Love it 4 3.3 Performance tactics 34 28.3 Works well 14 11.7 Cleans clothes better 7 5.8 Cleaner whites 5 4.2 Best brand 4 3.3 Other 4 3.3 Normative tactics 13 10.8 Wife likes it 8 6.7 Mother bought 3 2.5 Girlfriend likes 1 0.8 Husband likes 1 0.8 Nonclassified 11 9.2 Multiple statements 11 9.2 Total 120 NOTE: 11 subjects gave multiple statements such as "works well and is the cheapest." In these responses, 91 percent of the 120 consumers provided a simple, one-statement reason for their choice. Of the I 1 who did not, all provided a combi- nation of two simple statements (e.g., it works well and has a low price). If one views these multiple statements as more refined or specific choice tactics, even greater credence is given to the choice tactic view. When compared with the closed question, the degree of inter-question agreement was 72.5 percent. However, most of the disagreement was due to the fact that only 10 tactics were listed for the closed question and that, as a result, marny of the idiosyncratic responses were not included. This instrument was developed in the absence of knowledge about the diversity of tactics that consumers would provide and is thus limited. Since it was unable to fully capture the richness of the choice process, only findings per- taining to the open-ended responses are reported. One alternative explanation for these results is that consumers were unable or unmotivated to provide a complete description of the choice process. However, if one remembers that the typical choice time was approximately 4-5 seconds, it is clear that consumers were not engaging in a more detailed in-store evalua- tion process. Table 2 presents a summary of the answers to the free response question. A variety of choice tactics was employed. The most frequent responses were: "because it works well" (n = 14), "because I like it" (n = 20), and "because of the price" or "it is cheapest" (n = 18). Further, many of the other responses are quite similar (e.g., "cleans better" and "cleaner whites" are similar to "it works well"). Based on the judgments of two separate individuals, responses were categorized into five major groups. The two judges exhibited an agreement rate of 93 percent in the categorizations. Discrepancies were discussed and resolved by the experimenters. Based on these categorizations, the following groups emerged: price tactics (n = 27), affect or "I like it" tactics (n = 24), performance tactics (n = 34), normative tactics (n = 13), and other tactics (n = 22). Thus it appears that a large number of consumers based their decision on one of four major types of tactics. One group tends to purchase a brand based on price, another chooses a brand that is perceived to perform well in fulfilling needs, another buys a brand simply because the brand "is liked," and still another bases its decision on the preferences of others. In addition to identifying the types of tactics em- ployed, this study sought to discover whether there are meaningful differences between different types of decision makers. For exploratory purposes only, a discriminant analysis was performed to determine whether other variables measured in the study could differentiate arnong the major categories of tactics. Due to the sample size, only major demographic and search variables were employed as predictors. Also, while there are meaningful conceptual differences be- tween affect and performance tactics, present data do not permit a clear distinction between these two groups (i.e., one could like the product because it performs well). As a result, these two categories were combined. Thus differences between the price, affect/ performance, and normative groups were examined. Results indicate that a set of variables was able to discriminate between the three groups (Wilk's A = 0.369, p &lt; 0.0001). The results of group classification indicate that 81.6 percent of the cases were correctly classified. In addition, a jackknife procedure (Lach- enbruch and Mickey 1968) which was employed to validate this finding resulted in a 73.5 percent correct classification. Both of these percentages are significantly better than chance (t = 7.41, p &lt; 0.001 and t = 5.78, p &lt; 0.001).4 The seven variables responsible for discriminability are presented in Table 3. To examine specific differ- ences between groups, an examination of the univariate tests was made.

Newman-Kuehls procedure. In particular, several spe- cific differences are worth noting. First, consumers employing price-related tactics dif- fered in several aspects. They were less likely to be brand loyal and to have purchased a chosen brand for a long period of time. Also, they were more likely to engage in search, examine shelf tags, and state that they had paid greater attention to sale signs. Given that search time was generally brief, it is likely that these activities involved the search for price informa- tion, and hence that price-conscious consumers were no more likely to pay attention to information other than price than were other consumers. Affect performance tactic users are most strongly characterized by a higher degree of brand loyalty and longer experience in purchasing laundry detergent. Also, this category displays a higher proportion of females and a low level of attention to shelf tags. Normative tactic users possessed the lowest level of laundry detergent purchase experience and tended to show the lowest level of actual search (based on observation), although they indicated paying greater attention to package information other than price. A higher proportion of male consumers fall into this category. The following variables did not discriminate between groups: education, across-board and within-board comparison, perceived attention to point-of-purchase displays, packages, end-of-aisle displays, perceived ad influence, coupon usage, family size, and age. DISCUSSION The data from the present study allow one important conclusion: in the case of a laundry detergent decision, consumers engage in remarkably little in-store decision deliberation. This finding is consistent with the con- clusion reached by Olshavsky and Granbois (1979) about other products. This implies that when decision making occurs, a large portion of the process may occur outside the immediate in-store decision context (at least for de- tergents). In light of this, it is likely that a better understanding of consumer behavior may be aided by further investigation of how consumers process infor- mation continuously. In particular, research is needed to determine how consumers come to apply different types of choice tactics. For example, there are probably key reasons why some consumers employ price-related tactics while others base their decisions on a perfor- mance judgment. This study suggests that a variety of product-related experiences-such as product usage, numerous exposures to advertisements, and influence by others in a social environment (either by direct pressure or by modeling)-may play an important role in the decision-making process. It must be noted that the present study possesses several limitations. First, it examines decision making for only one product category. Before solid conclusions can be drawn, research is needed to make comparisons not only with other repeatedly purchased products, but also with important, less frequently purchased products. The latter comparison would serve as an important means of differentiating the types of decision strategies employed in different choice situations. Deshpande and Hoyer (1983) have already found that consumers reported (from a retrospective question- naire) using choice strategies which involved signifi- cantly higher degrees of cognitive effort for a choice that involved high risk (e.g., automobile) compared to a choice that involved low risk (e.g., peanut butter). Second, this study examines decision making at only one point in time. If decision making in many common choice contexts is truly of a continuous nature, an attempt must be made to examine the process over a repeated number of choice trials. We need information concerning the extent to which choice tactic usage is either consistent or altered over time, as well as information on which factors may lead to the adoption of an alternative choice tactic. The third limitation of this study is that it employed only one observer. Future research of this nature should use multiple observers in order to permit reliability assessment. In summary, the present study has attempted to extend work on consumer choice by demonstrating</page><page sequence="8">COMMON PRODUCT DECISION MAKING 829 that consumers employ simple choice tactics when making a low-involvement decision. This choice is not necessarily habitual (Howard 1977), nor is it necessarily characterized by the total absence of any pre-purchase deliberation (Olshavsky and Granbois 1979); rather, this study suggests that choice is the result of numerous experiences and evaluations which occur over a repeated number of trials (or purchases). Over these trials, consumers develop a set of simple choice tactics which permit a quick yet satisfactory decision. While the present study does not provide full support for this notion, it represents an important first step in developing a more descriptive theory of consumer choice. Research is now needed to test this view and to examine how situational and individual- level variables interact in the usage of choice tactics over time. [Received June 1983.
