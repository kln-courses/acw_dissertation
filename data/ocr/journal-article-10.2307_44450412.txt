<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICHEL FOUCAULT: THE KNOWLEDGE OF POWER AND THE POWER OF KNOWLEDGE JEAN CLAUDE GUÉDON Presenting Foucault' s work to an Anglo-American audience poses two different kinds of difficulties. First, Foucault' s studies are extremely rich, but their very richness rests on a number of complex, interconnected arguments, not easily summarised within the narrow compass of an article. Second, Foucault' s quest emerges from a long series of philosophical and political debates heard much more clearly on the banks of the Seine than near the Thames or, a fortiori , in the vicinity of the East River. Phenome- nology and Existentialism never penetrated the philosophical circles of the English-speaking world and it is not surprising, therefore, to find out that Structuralism, itself a reaction against both of these philosophical stances, is viewed as a very cryptic exercise by most Anglo-Saxons. Only linguists, anthropologists and literary critics have paid some attention to the message of Structuralism; but listening, as everyone knows, does not necessarily imply acceptance or even hearing correctly. To complicate matters further, Foucault is not a Structuralist, strictly speaking, even though some of his approaches have obviously been inspired by Structuralism. For reasons touched upon later, Foucault' s works have been translated into English. This, however, proved to be a dubious honour indeed, as they emerged literally out of context, an isolated archipelago of studies lost in a sea of staunch empiricism and pragmatism. As a result, they have been perceived as very curious objects indeed; at least this is the impression derived from reading reviews of his books in English-language journals. Nearly all English and American critics agree: Foucault, whatever he may be trying to do, is so very obscure! Alfred Lars Aronson, for example, generously provides us with the first sample of a long series of convergent appreciations: 4 4 Foucault' s book [Birth of the Clinic] is extraordinarily difficult to read. Sentences, even paragraphs, are sometimes so convoluted as to escape analysis. . . . 'M Peter Caws echoes the same sentiment while reviewing The Order of Things 2 and adds even a sense of 4 'linguistic 1 Alfred Lars Aronson, "Medicine: history and theory," The Yale Review, 1974, 63: 476. 2 Peter Caws, "Language as the human reality," New Republic, March 27, 1971, 164: 34. 245 BULLETIN OF THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE 51 245-277 (1977) Copyright ® 1977 by The Johns Hopkins University Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.</page><page sequence="2">246 JEAN-CLAUDE GUÉDON outrage" in his account of Birth of the Clinic .3 Presumably not to be outdone by his American counterparts, the English reviewer for the New Statesman complains that 4 'great stretches of it [The Order of Things ] are arid and impossibly obscure . . .";4 and his colleague Zeldin, commenting on the Archeology of Knowledge for the same magazine, writes somewhat wryly: "It is no easy matter translating Foucault. He is obscure enough in his own language; in English, he is odder still .... In translation, he emerges as the archetypal foreigner - barely comprehensible, vaguely suspi- cious, best avoided."5 The list could go on at the cost of monotony, but the point is clear, I trust: most English speakers find Foucault either obscure, or difficult, or both. Yet, it is important to decide whether Foucault is genuinely obscure or merely difficult: Boileau reminds us that obscurity is the reflection of a confused mind and, therefore, represents a defect attributable to the speaker or writer;6 difficulty, on the other hand, may be unavoidable in some cases where the subject matter is particularly complex. Few French critics, if any, have ever raised the question of Foucault' s obscurity. François Russo provides a particularly good example of French reactions to Foucault' s writings, especially since he cannot be accused of cavorting with the more esoteric coteries to be found in Paris: such people do not generally spend time, as he did, putting together a bibliography on the history of science, or on any other subject for that matter. All this does not prevent him from giving a very positive review of Foucault' s Archeology of Knowledge - clearly his most abstract and difficult work to date. For Russo, "this work deserves a precise and elaborate review all the more that, unlike most works in the same vein, it is well written and extremely clear. The author controls his topic; he knows where he is going; he is intent on defining the exact meaning of the notions which he uses and he explains himself with all the precision and rigour that may be asked for."7 Clarté en-decà des Pyrénées ; obscurité au-delà?

Sometimes such difficulty results from differences in style, and sometimes from a writer's cultivation of obscurity. Neither, I think, is the main reason for the difficulty experienced in seriously reading Foucault' s book. The main reason is that we have grown discontentedly accustomed to reading books that apply well-known methods and concepts to phenomena that are hardly problematic to begin with. An encounter with a work that differs on both counts is apt to be arduous and demanding.8 Yes, Foucault is difficult, and he is so because he has completely shifted the mode in which the past can be questioned. Both the position occupied by the Foucaldian historian, i.e. the archeologist, and the landscape he can thereby uncover, seem very alien at first. Therein lies the difficulty of Foucault' s analyses. It will be the burden of this paper to show how Foucault differs from historians of ideas in general, and historians of science in particular. It will also be the burden of this paper to try to demonstrate why Foucault' s explorations are important for the doing of history of science. Although viewed as obscure or difficult, Foucault has been translated into English and is being read in that language. As years go by, his books crowd more and more shelves of the universities' bookstores as they are incorpo- rated into the reading lists of a growing number of courses. Like it or not, more and more discussions centre about him. But why? One answer is that he is an exciting writer, and most critics seem pretty well agreed on that point too.9 The problem areas studied by Foucault are clearly of interest to many readers and the more fundamental methodological issues raised by him contribute even more to his appeal. As will be seen in this paper, his books ultimately lead to several important issues, including the status of knowledge, its function and the role of the knowledge-producer, or intellectual, in society. The growth of Foucault' s fame has had little to do with the field of history of science, history of ideas and, in general, history. And yet, most of hiś works ostensibly deal with historical topics. Actually, it is through psychia- try that Foucault has penetrated the English-speaking world - or more accurately, it is through the anti-psychiatric movement that this process 8 David Matza, "Review of Madness and Civilisation,'''' American Sociological Review, 1966, 31: 551-52. Other reasons tied to intellectual and political factors will be investigated later. 9 See Aronson, op. cit. (n. 1 above), 476; Caws, op. cit. (n. 2 above), 34; Caws, op. cit.

D. Laing was the central figure in this respect,10 and it is he who helped launch Madness and Civilisation on its English career. Yet Foucault does not owe any particular allegiance to the anti- psychiatric movement: for him, the question of insanity is only one facet of a much more general problem - namely the relationship between knowledge and power. But the publishing of Foucault' s thesis coincided in time with the emergence of anti-psychiatry in the public eye. As a result, Foucault' s book was able to skip over the Channel and land in England. To be sure, the resistance has been and still is fierce, but it is already too late: a beachhead has been secured and the invasion is on. * * * Many historians of science tend to place their discipline within intellectual history. But what is intellectual history? If we follow someone like Crane Brinton, intellectual history can be characterised in three different but essentially complementary ways. First, it deals with the question of who wrote what when. Second, it attempts to delineate a cartography of ideas, in the vein of Arthur O. Lovejoy, for example. Finally, it sets out to investigate the relationship between what men say and what they do.11 What is interesting in Brinton' s description of intellectual history is less its possible accuracy than the vantage point from which it is written. And that vantage point, I believe, is fairly representative of intellectual historians. Brinton' s description - and this is quite striking - does not seem to consider that the social act of writing might have something to do with the kind of ideas ultimately embedded in a given text. Instead, authors are identified mainly to serve as a convenient short-hand label for a constella- tion of ideas. Thus Newton can stand in the place of notions like force, attraction or, alternatively, unitarianism. To the specific name, Newton, corresponds a specific notion of force, attraction, etc. If, for Brinton, the social practice of writing seems to play little or no role in the emergence of ideas, ideas on the other hand may influence human events, and it is the task of the intellectual historian to understand how such a process may take place. In other words, Brinton and all those who share 10 Peters, op. cit. (n. 9 above), 636; R. D. Laing, "The invention of madness," The New Statesman, June 16, 1967, 73: 843. 11 Crane Brinton, "Intellectual History," in the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences (New York: MacMillan and the Free Press, 1968), vol. 6, pp. 464-5.

It is this latter work which determined my choice, as it constitutes a standard and respected reference.</page><page sequence="5">MICHEL FOUCAULT 249 his assumptions tend to think that the history of ideas should be idealistic history; that is to say they tend to favour the power of ideas over the material world rather than the reverse. Transcribed into a vocabulary familiar to historians of science, Brinton's approach could read: certain scientists write certain scientific works at specific times and places. These embody theories and concepts which can be classified. On some occasions, some of these theories and concepts are used to generate new concepts and theories by and out of themselves; alternatively, they lead either to technical applications or are transferred analogically to other cultural domains such as art, literature or politics. All of this is well known among historians of science: their many hours of research spent in the great libraries of the world aim at fulfilling this task. Internalists or externalists, they ultimately strive to write a history of scientific ideas which, to repeat myself, tends to take the side of idealistic history. But there is a problem: Ideas , almost by definition, do not possess a history. -Ideas do not possess a history? What nonsensical paradox is this? Scientific concepts and theories are made up of ideas. Given this limited claim, is it not obvious that the theories and concepts used by a Kepler, for example, are different from those enunciated by Copernicus? But they are not unrelated either. As a result, a text can be written retracing the transformation leading from the latter to the former. Now, how can you say that ideas do not possess a history? -And so texts such as you describe can be and are written. But is the existence of such texts sufficient to guarantee their historicity? Surely not. If they are descriptive, we are faced with a simple chronology; if they attempt to include causes, then they are ideologically loaded. But to prove this last point, I suggest we explore the weaknesses inherent in the concept of history of ideas. The archeological method offered by Foucault provides a critical alternative to it. Its value, as we shall see, depends on the perception scholars have of themselves, whether they see themselves as privileged but alienated observers of society, or whether they intend to take an active part in it, including its transformation. Foucault' s studies are not disconnected, but rather must be viewed as an ongoing process of exploration. It is from this perspective that the Archeology of Knowledge must be approached. Coming as it did, after Madness and Civilisation , Birth of the Clinic and The Order of Things , it presents both a method and a methodical re-evaluation of Foucault' s</page><page sequence="6">250 JEAN-CLAUDE GUÉDON previous works. Unlike the three other books just mentioned, the Archeology of Knowledge is not based on archival research; nor does it try to cope with specific historical situations. Rather, it offers the sketch of an "archeolo- gical" method and ends by examining its implications for the status of knowledge. The Archeology of Knowledge represents but a temporary stop in Foucaulťs intellectual movement, and it is already fairly old,12 but it does provide an unusually sharp outline of his theoretical stance as well as a focused critique of the history of ideas. Consequently, the Archeology of Knowledge will provide the basis for most of the developments in the remainder of this paper. But I will not limit myself to this work alone and, as the case warrants, will draw on most of Foucaulťs studies, including his recent and admirable study of prisons.13 Let me recall that Brinton set the first task of intellectual history as responding to the question of who wrote what when. Foucault demonstrates that the who's, the what's and the when' s are not the clear categories they appear to be. As an example, let us follow Foucault in his analysis of the "what." The something which someone writes must somehow possess some unity to retain its identity of something . What are the units usually utilised by the historian of science in this respect? Most commonly, they are the book and the works (of an author).14 The book, despite its appearances (e.g. it possesses a well-defined volume; it has precise economic value), forms an ambiguous unit. For example, is an anthology as monolithic as a collection of posthumous fragments, or is it more so, or less so? What about a mathematical treatise on conic sections, or the first volume of Michelet' s multi- volume history of France? Is the book the same kind of object when it recounts a trial, when it encloses a contemporary novel, or when it is a prayer-book? Consequently, the book as physical object does not maintain a one-to-one, or even a fixed, relationship with its verbal content. That difficulty alone undermines whatever claims that could be made on behalf of the book (still viewed as physical object) as a unit of analysis. If the book cannot form a coherent unit of analysis, then why not look for 12 Michel Foucault, L'Archéologie du savoir (Paris: Gallimard, 1969). 13 Michel Foucault, Surveiller et punir. Naissance de la prison (Paris, Gallimard, 1975). 14 The two paragraphs which follow essentially paraphrase and summarise pp. 33-6 of L' Archéologie du savoir.</page><page sequence="7">MICHEL FOUCAULT 25 1 units at the verbal level of the book. In other words, let us focus on what could be called text so as to examine whether it would form a viable unit of discourse. But the text is not without its own problems. For one thing, it does not always display the same kind of unity. There Foucault contrasts a novel by Stendhal to Dante's Divine Comedy, or Homer's Iliad to the Odyssey. Texts are caught within kinds of networks which differ according to the nature of their content. Mathematical texts do not relate to each other in the way that nineteenth-century French novels do. As a result, the retreat from books to texts has only made more obvious the elusive nature of the fundamental units which are nonetheless uncritically manipulated by histori- ans every day when they treat documents as if they always functioned in a similar manner in the society which produced them. If books and texts evaporate, so to speak, before our eyes, the works of an author do not fare any better. First, works come in all kinds of forms and shapes, ranging from the piece of writing published under the author's name to the anonymous fragment; from the posthumous sketch to bits of correspondence. As Foucault writes: "Establishing the complete works, or opus presupposes a definite number of choices which are not easy to justify or even to formulate."15 Foucault' s critique of the book, the text and the works leads to two consequences: on the one hand, intellectual history which relies almost exclusively on these categories finds its whole approach - objects manipu- lated as well as strategies of manipulations - fundamentally threatened. But at the same time, a sort of liberation takes place: all texts free themselves from their old form of organisation. As books and works lose their assumed natural evidence, texts can, in a sense, scatter themselves anew. As such, they cannot be approached yet, but new questions can arise on the ashes of the old order: in particular, what kinds of units could or should be reconstituted which would have some objective and tangible validity?16 In answer to this question, Foucault refuses to be seduced by ready-made solutions. For example, the use of the constitutive units of linguistics is one of the first temptations to be avoided. Linguistics, to be sure, does take a sample of texts actually spoken or written (parole ) and then strives to recreate or discover the rules or laws which allow the construction of such texts. However, the laws of a langue can lead to an infinite variety of performances, and should in fact anticipate all aspects of parole. On the 15 Ibid., p. 35. The same question is broached in M. Foucault, "Qu'est-ce qu'un auteur?" Bulletin de la Société française de philosophie, 1969, 63 (3): 73-104. 16 Ibid., pp. 38-39.</page><page sequence="8">252 JEAN-CLAUDE GUÉDON other hand, the collection of texts recently scattered by the 4 'death" of books and works can be very large indeed, but never infinite, so that the constitutive units of discourse, unlike those of language, can and must generate only a limited number of discourses. Moreover, while linguistics would ask: "what are the rules used to construct such and such an enunciation?" Foucault would investigate how it is that this enunciation and none other appeared when and where it did.17 If the texts just scattered by Foucault' s analysis cannot be treated by linguistic means only, it is equally clear that the history of ideas cannot answer his question either. While the history of ideas attempts to reconstruct systems of thought from a judicious selection of texts, it does so by appealing to notions like the intentions of the author or authors, and even to their unconscious. In other words, the history of ideas tries to unveil what is really being said behind the surface of the texts surveyed.18 Foucault, however, is looking for a form of analysis devoid of all references to psychologism, be they direct or indirect. If texts are scattered into units yet to be identified, they must also be caught within some kind of boundaries. In response to this problem, Foucault is led to examine the "assumed continuities with which the discourse intended for analysis is already organised."19 In other words, Foucault is weary of historians' strategies which, by their very nature, prejudge the results obtained in the course of the investigation. Obviously the ways in which documents are selected can be determinant and such a task must not be performed blindly. Historical continuities, for their part, provide ways to interfere with or justify certain kinds of selection patterns. As such, they must be examined very critically. For Foucault, continuities impose themselves under two disguises: on the one hand, the historian looks for a hidden and more obscure origin to any event which gives the appearance (or is it reality?) of abruptly departing from existing conditions; on the other hand, he is constantly tempted to interpret the texts he reads in such a way as to bring to the fore a second text situated somewhere beyond the ostensible meaning of the discourse itself. Moreover, the hidden message is often perceived as the repetition or the elaboration of something said before. A good example of this approach is Koyré's "discovery" of Platonism behind the texts of Galileo. By trans- forming Galileo into a ventriloquist, Koyré is able to weave a continuous 17 Ibid., p. 39. 18 Ibid., p. 40. 19 Ibid ., p. 36.</page><page sequence="9">MICHEL FOUCAULT 253 thread from Greek antiquity to the early seventeenth century, with all the ideological consequences such a method carries with it, like the unity of Western culture, its venerable age, etc. In short, Foucault argues, historians of ideas constantly try to erase discontinuities by refusing to take the brutal irruption of certain events at face value and by never listening to the author's ostensible message. Instead, they choose to listen to a hypothetical and repressed message, a sort of counterpoint to the first one, which must be brought to the surface thanks to their skill and the methods at their disposal, such as interpretation and exegesis. If influence and diffusion are introduced as the organising principles of the discourse of the historians of ideas, then it becomes possible to see culture spreading like a thin film of oil over the sea of time. The historians of ideas, in other works, consider that if the historical events he deals with proceed at all, then they proceed smoothly. And since he pays little or no attention to the actual mode of functioning of the documents he studies in their social setting, he can rest satisfied with a limited selection of 4 'representative" works evenly spread in time, preferably but not necessarily penned by great men. His task consists in bridging these works together, preferably in a new and clever way, for public performance plays a great role in the practice of intellectual history. However, as Foucault has shown, the books, texts and works which constitute the foundation of such an exercise are very fragile indeed, and a reconstruction of the past cannot rest on such casual principles of selection. Having criticised the traditional units organising the discourse of historians of ideas, Foucault is then faced with the problem of elaborating an alternative to them. To this end, Foucault devotes a great deal of space, nearly a third of the Archeology of Knowledge ,20 and, consequently, following him in all the meanders of his argument would lead us too far afield. Nevertheless, it will be useful to depict the units searched for by an archeology of knowledge, however sketchily, to provide a full view of Foucault' s method. The task of the archeologist consists in describing enunciations (énoncés). But what does Foucault mean by describing and by enunciations? Let us turn to the question of enunciations first. To think about enunciations as units leads to thinking about them as atoms of discourse.21 As such, they can be compared to similar units of discourse constructed from the vantage point of various disciplines such as 20 Ibid., pp. 44-173. 21 Ibid., p. 107.</page><page sequence="10">254 JEAN-CLAUDE GUÉDON logic, grammar and linguistics. In so doing, Foucault achieves two ends at once: on the one hand, he specifies the nature of enunciations by underlining what they are not; on the other hand, he demonstrates the autonomy of the archeological approach by showing that it cannot be reduced to any of the discourses of potentially competing disciplines. After having shown that enunciations are not logical propositions, grammatical sentences or, finally, speech acts, Foucault is led to conclude that enunciations do not exist at the same level as language.22 But this discovery leads to a new question: the signs used to represent a language graphically do not exist at the same level as language either: where do enunciations situate themselves between signs and language? Could it be that enunciations are but the graphic or material precondition of language? Foucault responds to this question by pointing out that if the material types found on a typewriter are but material instruments which allow the transformation of language into a material object, on the other hand the series Q, W, E, R, T, Y, found in a typewriter manual, is the enunciation of the alphabetical order adopted by typewriters in the English-speaking world.23 As a result, an enunciation is neither entirely a linguistic entity (as propositions, sentences and speech acts are) nor a completely material object as are the lead types used in the printing process. The enunciation is not a structure either; that is to say, it is not a set of relationships between variable elements which could yield a number, perhaps an infinite number, of concrete models. Instead, it is that which allows justifying the presence of certain signs among others , their inter-relationships , their referents , and whether they have meaning or not. Moreover, and this is crucial for an understanding of Foucault' s approach, enunciations are that which allow seeing what kind of act is involved in the very (written or oral) formulation of a sign.24 A last detail merits being underlined: I wrote that the enunciation allowed understanding a number of variables ascribed to signs; but what is involved in this process of allowing ? How does the archeologist function, in short? Foucault' s answer is clear and will be important for the conclusion of this paper: the archeologist acts by analysis or by intuition.25 In conclusion, enunciations are a function of existence, to use Foucault' s 22 Ibid., p. 112 and p. 113. 2i Ibid., p. 114. 24 Ibid., p. 115. 25 Ibid. Later on, in the Archeology . . . , Foucault writes: "It is just so that I have never presented archeology as a science or even as the first foundation of a future science." Ibid., p. 269.</page><page sequence="11">MICHEL FOUCAULT 255 very words; that is to say, enunciations act like a mathematical function, transforming the set of all signs into a set of allowable signs which, thereby, take meaning (in the case of sentences) or possess truth (in the case of logical propositions).26 After having dealt with enunciations, Foucault proceeds to describe the enunciative function just outlined and maps out the result of what is allowed by enunciations - namely, discursive configurations.27 This step finally leads Foucault to the important notion of discursive practice which he defines as follows: "It is a set of anonymous and historical rules, always specific as to time and place, and which, for a given period and within a social, economic, geographic or linguistic zone, define the framework within which the enunciative functions are exercised."28 Such are, very roughly sketched, some of the constitutive concepts of archeology. Let us now turn to the aims of the archeological method, among which Foucault sees four fundamental ones.29 1. Archeology addresses itself to available discourses seen not as passive receptacles of information, but as enunciative practices submitted to rules of formation. Archeology does not deal with ideas or thought. It does not seek to interpret documents as signs pointing to something else. Rather, it reads texts as if they were monuments, i.e. objects amenable to systematic descriptions. In so doing, it deals with the materiality of the text, itself made up of two parts: linguistic materiality and physical appearance. 2. Archeology tries to identify the rules which have guided the elaboration of the discourse under examination (as an archeologist, in the more common sense of the word, would examine the architectural practices which presided over the construction of a temple for example). One of Foucault' s goals consists in seeing whether the set of rules corresponding to a given discourse is irreducible to the set of rules ascribed to another discourse. "Archeology," as Foucault puts it, "is a differential analysis of the modalities of discourse." 3. Archeology refuses to be an "anthropology (in the etymological meaning of the word) of creation." By this, Foucault means to refuse the projects of explaining the creation of a work by appealing to psychology, sociology and all the other available sciences of man. For one thing, the unit 26 Ibid., p. 115. 27 Ibid., pp. 139-154. 28 I.e. rules which belong to the domain of history, not rules which determine the historical process. Ibid., pp. 153-154. 29 Ibid., The four points which follow are taken from ibid., pp. 182-183.</page><page sequence="12">256 JEAN-CLAUDE GUÉDON work is not very secure, as we have already seen. Secondly, the sciences of man, according to his own analysis in The Order of Things , are but the transient consequences of a peculiar cultural structure, or epistemic configuration, to use his own concepts. They constitute, therefore, a very unreliable foundation for any theoretical analysis. 4. Archeology is the systematic description of discourse qua object. It refuses to deal with what may have been thought, wanted, aimed at or desired by men contemporary to the examined discourse. It only deals with discourse as a material object produced by certain types of human activities. From this capsule description of the aims of archeology arises an obsessive theme: discourse is taken as a thing, resulting from a practice, and nothing else. Here is certainly a very unusual approach to the past, and a justification for such extraordinary steps must be discovered. The answer, I believe, is linked with my earlier remark that, stricto sensu , ideas do not possess a history. This consciously provocative statement can now be dissected in the following manner: a text does not embody ideas; it embodies words. Ideas originate not in the text, but in the brain of the reader. The confrontation of the reading activity of a man with a text gives rise to ideas; but once the activity itself ceases, once the text returns to its shelf, it does not possess ideas, only its own materiality. Although not alone in this regard, historians have entertained an extraor- dinary illusion for many years, not to say decades. With an obstinacy admirable in almost any other circumstances, they tend to believe that the text they pull out of archives acts as a neutral vessel filled to the brim with ideas. With an honourable, but unrealistic humility, they have seen their task as the transfer of ideas from texts to other texts (their own) via their brains. In effect, they pour some ideas from one series of texts into another. And as sometimes the archival vessel is a little rusty and hard to open up, they display a good deal of ingenuity to extract the ideas from it all the same. In the process, they look right through the vessel itself and, in effect, refuse to see it. Historians, in other words, spend an enormous amount of time (and of money) not to see what the great libraries of the world have kept in store for them. If historians drove their cars as they read documents, historical problems would be quickly solved faute de combattants. Foucault simply says: please open your eyes at long last and see. The goals of the archeological method already point out how different it is from the history of ideas; its modes of analysis underline this contrast even more. In fact, the archeology of Foucault does not simply differ from the</page><page sequence="13">MICHEL FOUCAULT 257 history of ideas: it actually stands in self-conscious opposition to it.30 Foucault himself sees this opposition revolve around four broad questions: (a) the role and place of novelty; (b) the analysis of contradictions; (c) comparative descriptions; (d) identification of transformations. When it comes to analysing what is new, the history of ideas performs what amounts to two contradictory tasks. It attempts to identify what is new, but immediately proceeds to discover the causes which must stand behind this apparent emergence. However, causes allegedly leading to the emergence of new ideas are exactly what prevents these ideas from being really new.31 Archeology, on the other hand, refuses to deal with the question of novelty as such. Instead, it focuses on the regularity (i.e. the obedience to specified rules of formation) of given discourses, be they second or third zone text, or, on the contrary, so-called major discoveries. As Foucault puts it, and I will let the reader judge his mood: "What archeology looks for in the texts of Linnaeus or of Buffon, of Petty or of Ricardo, of Pinel or of Bichat is not aimed at devising the list of the holy founding fathers; instead, it aims at unveiling the regularity of a discursive practice " (my emphasis).32 Since Hegel and Marx, contradictions are at the centre of historical writing. But not so for the history of ideas. To contradictions, the history of ideas responds in two ways. In a first move, it denies their existence:33 If texts display contradictions, such as incoherent use of vocabulary or incompatible propositions, the historian attempts to find an angle from which the contradiction disappears. But, in a second phase, if the contradic- tion has survived this first line of work, then it suddenly takes on a new and fundamental role: it becomes the very basis of the discourse under scrutiny. By their very polarity, the contradictory elements are then viewed as the agents manufacturing in effect a conceptual space which makes the discourse under scrutiny possible in the first place. The text then becomes part of a debate, sometimes also known as a crisis, a term used fondly by historians who differ as much as P. Hazard and T. S. Kuhn. Contradictions are, of course, disquieting for any historian engaged in the task of understanding the past. It is not surprising, therefore, to see the history of ideas either refuse the existence of contradictions or relegate them 30 Ibid., p. 181. 31 Ibid., pp. 184-188. 32 Ibid ., p. 189.

Archeology, on the other hand, fully accepts the fact that contradictions, like discontinuities, do not make sense. Instead of trying to create sense at all cost, archeology makes two important points: first, ideas do not generate ideas, with or without dialectics:34 second, contradictions must be treated in themselves, as objects to be described.35 In short, archeology explores the different types of contradictions in terms of the levels at which they affect the constitutive elements of discourse. One of the constitutive units of analysis acceptable to the archeological method is the concept.36 This unit is interesting not only because it can be a potential site for contradictions, but also because its presence seems in itself to contradict many of the tenets of the method devised by Foucault. Are concepts so very different from ideas? And if not, what place can they occupy in Foucault' s archeology? Not surprisingly, Foucault is led to recast the notion of concept. To do so, he appeals once again to his fundamental notion of discursive practice. Within this framework, concepts are no longer the organising principles of discourse; rather they are small discursive elements dispersed within a given discourse according to the inherent rules attached to a specific writing practice. Contradictions between concepts arise when their relationship with their abstract referent conflicts. In other words, concepts can contradict each other at the level of meaning. However, the way in which these concepts function within the discourse may be perfectly equivalent, despite contradictory meaning. Between the discursive practice itself and the concepts, there exists a preconceptual level made up of rules of formation and of distribution of concepts. Thus attribution , articulation, designation and derivation form the preconceptual schemes identified by the archeologist in his analysis of general grammar. They allow him to describe how different grammatical analyses are made possible in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; how an activity like grammatical analysis can define a domain of validity for itself; how it also creates a normative domain allowing the inclusion and the exclusion of a number of enunciations, etc.37 The kinds of contradiction which may arise between some of the concepts of general 34 A dialectical process cannot be applied to ideas, the archeologist argues, because ideas have no tangible reality of their own. This does not mean that Foucault refuses to use dialectics. It only means that he will insist upon dialectics being applied to real objects, thereby doing to historians of ideas what Marx did to Hegel. 35 Ibid., p. 198. 36 ibid., pp. 198-204. 37 Ibid., pp. 80-84.

On the énoncé, see ibid., pp. 105-65.</page><page sequence="15">MICHEL FOUCAULT 259 grammar can then be gauged by reference to this preconceptual level constructed by the archeologist. After novelty and contradictions come comparisons: there again the history of ideas differs markedly from the archeological method.38 More- over, this topic is particularly important for Foucault' s own work as it provides him with an opportunity to correct either misinterpretations of his Order of Things or overenthusiatic formulations found within it. In the history of ideas, the comparison of two ideas always tends to support either the theme of continuity in time or that of diffusion in space. Not so in archeology; instead, comparisons are ways to confront simultaneous discur- sive practices in order to examine whether they maintain between themselves a number of relationships amenable to systematic description.39 In no case does this project attempt to salvage notions such as worldviews , spirits of the age , or similar metaphysical entities. Where history of ideas tries to "smooth out" the historical landscape, archeology, on the contrary, tends to sharpen its asperities. Quite often, the comparison of two ideas leads the historian of ideas to construct a causal sequence leading from idea A to idea B. Rather than looking for causes, the archeologist, although this is not a necessary part of his project, may try to see how the rules which preside over the formation of discourses may be linked with non-discursive systems such as institutions, political events, economic processes and the like. However, the discursive and non-discursive levels can never be mediated by a consciousness, for that would undermine the whole archeological project once and for all. For example, Foucault argues that the political life of the French Revolution did not determine the meaning and the form of revolutionary medicine; instead, the political practices of the Revolution must be analysed as conditions which make possible the emergence of a specific medical discourse; instead again, the archeologist looks for a specific mode of relationship which can be described in time and space, and it is his task to identify this relationship, specify its points of application in both the discursive and the non-discursive areas; in short describe its modalities. Thanks to this crucial development, Foucault can confidently refute the notion sometimes ascribed to him that discourses are purely ideal or formal entities, independent of history. On the contrary, he argues, archeology is an integral part of a general history yet to be constituted.40 "Ibid., pp. 205-15. "Ibid., p. 206. 40 Ibid., p. 215.

In that book, the reader was confronted with three domains of study, natural history, study of wealth and general grammar. Suddenly, and apparently inexplicably, these three areas of knowledge transformed themselves or found themselves transformed into respectively biology, economics and historical linguistics. The simultaneity of these three conversions, moreover, could and did induce some to believe that whole cultures were abruptly appearing and disappearing. In a chapter on change and transformation,41 Foucault clarifies both the fundamental character and the limitations inherent to these abrupt disconti- nuities so often present in his other books as well. Limitation: the discontinuities unveiled by Foucault, far from affecting whole cultures, only touch the exact zone circumscribed by his analyses. They should not be extrapolated to whole cultures. Limitation again: the discontinuities affect only the archeological level of analysis and no other level. Thus the discontinuities described by Foucault are discontinuities in the discursive practices being scrutinised. But while a discursive practice may change, other elements of the discourse may remain the same. As an example, a change in discursive practice does not necessarily coincide with a shift in language, although the converse is often true. It must be noted that the historian of ideas does not explain discontinuities any more than does the archeologist. He either erases them or places them at such a fundamental level that they become the uncaused cause of a whole set of historical events (as in the case of revolutions as this term is used in that discipline). The archeologist, on the other hand, identifies discontinuities and describes them. Only by moving from the discursive level to the non- discursive level can he hope to insert this systematic description of the discontinuity within a more encompassing system of description which might play a role analogous to that of cause. But cause is here taken in a sense both more general and more abstract than is usually the case. Causes are meant to explain. In Foucault' s archeology, explaining means inserting a descriptive system into a more encompassing descriptive system. Finally, it must be remembered that, for the archeologist, discontinuities act as and does not impose a priori limits on the number of relevant variables. In short, its conceptual tools are as open-ended as the field it claims stakes for - namely all men from all times and all areas. 41 Ibid., pp. 216-231.</page><page sequence="17">MICHEL FOUCAULT 26 1 safeguards against such mystifying concepts as progress, human nature and so on, all concepts constitutive of a mystifying history. In summary, the enigmatic nature of the transformations witnessed in the archeological descriptions is a product of the boundaries imposed by the archeologist to his own field of investigation. Thus, in The Order of Things transformations do just take place without any explanation or apology as to why; but this is due to Foucault' s limiting himself strictly to a discursive domain. Had he chosen to introduce non-discursive elements in his analysis of the three domains of knowledge which concern him in that book, he would have explained how such non-discursive factors as the French Revolution could lead to historical junctions where some kinds of discourses are no longer possible (disappearance or reorganisation of institutions, new forms of education, new classes of population affected by the form of knowledge under scrutiny, etc.) Foucault' s analysis of change and transformation does something more as well. By identifying areas of discourse whose practice remains unchanged for a number of years or even decades, he brings to light the non- homogeneous nature of time as it functions within a particular discursive zone. In other words, instead of assuming that historical events are legislated by the flow of homogeneous time, Foucault demonstrates that certain events keep on repeating themselves for a while before disappearing to leave room for new categories of events. Segments of duration (or temporality, to use a more standard terminology now current in French historical writing at least), therefore, come to replace the even ticking away of Newtonian time. Why did historians subscribe to a notion of homogeneous time? Foucault ascribes this illusion to anthropomorphism: the linear structure of spoken language in time and the self-consciousness of a stream of thoughts are both unconsciously projected on outside reality.42 The aims and the methods of Foucault' s archeology are bound to lead to strange new panoramas, very different from those usually revealed by the history of ideas, and this is indeed what Foucault' s separate studies achieve. In particular, in the place of the familiar history of science, an archeology of knowledge has emerged. If archeology is to replace history, is knowledge to replace science?43 And if so, what are the implications for the status of both 4^ Ibid . , p. 220. 43 The French words connaissance and savoir are both rendered into English by knowledge. However, Foucault reserves the former for the constitutive activity of a consciousness (knowing subject), while the latter is reserved for archeological knowledge. Were it not for unfortunate technical connotations, these two terms might be rendered fairly adequately by knowledge and know-how respectively.</page><page sequence="18">262 JEAN-CLAUDE GUÉDON science and knowledge? What can be known, and how secure is that knowledge? Also, what is knowledge for? For the historian, knowledge and science differ because the canons of arguments which obtain in each domain differ as well. Arguments used in the case of knowledge may not require the empirical data scientific argument would; or perhaps they obey a less rigorous logic or a less exacting testing procedure; or they may even be so different as to defy comparison. Whatever the case may be, for the historian, science generally remains the fundamental yardstick by which to judge and evaluate all other forms of knowledge. At the same time, the distance which separates science from knowledge can be bridged by a series of transformations affecting the constitutive elements of knowledge and allowing it to accede to the status of science.44 For the archeologist, knowledge is merely what can be rendered by language as modulated by a given discursive practice which, thereby, finds itself specified.45 Knowledge, in other words, is the ability to say something about certain objects, be they material or conceptual objects. This ability, needless to add, is not a creative characteristic attributable to an individual, but refers instead to the rules embedded in the discursive practice itself. The only other requirement to add is that knowledge corresponds to an ordered discursive practice, order susceptible of being described by the archeologist. Finally and most crucially, knowledge is further characterised by its potential for use and by the ways in which it can be appropriated by certain groups for certain ends. The passage from knowledge to science does not correspond to the transition from non- truth or half-truth to truth; instead, the archeologist considers that the transition to science simply corresponds to an intensifica- tion within a given discursive practice.46 What is being intensified are descriptive variables such as the density of a conceptual network, the precision with which these concepts are defined and the degree to which they are criticised, the degree of formalisation and so on. The intensification in practice corresponding to the establishment of a peculiar science leads to specific relationships between knowledge and science, and it is exactly at 44 This transformation has been the object of repeated and detailed studies by Gaston Bachelard who also introduced the idea of an epistemologica! threshold, about which more later. 45 Ibid., p. 238. The different characteristics of savoir are found on this page and following one in L' Archéologie .... 46 This point does raise a problem which can only be mentioned here - namely whether an intensification of certain aspects of a given discursive practice (such as greater systematicky, more formalised concepts and strategies, etc.) does not really amount to the creation of a different discursive practice.</page><page sequence="19">MICHEL FOUCAULT 263 this junction that ideology affects the scientific discourse; it is also at this point that science can play its own ideological role.47 In other words, when science arrogates to itself the right to judge all other forms of knowledge, it can, in the same movement, serve ideological aims which reach far beyond the quest for truth which provides its ostensible goals. This analysis leads Foucault to support the thesis that, far from being mutually exclusive, science and ideology are indissolubly bound together.48 However paradoxical an expression like 4 4 scientific ideology" may look or sound, it does make sense in the context of archeology, if it is remembered that science cannot claim anything more (and anything less, for that matter) than being one of the products among many of a given discursive practice. Indeed, from the angle of a practice, it would be difficult to see how any discourse could claim any kind of pristine purity, the claim itself being clearly ideological in nature; but I shall come back to this point later. The description and classification of discursive practices are performed by the archeologist in terms of a number of reference points or thresholds; together they specify the stage-like mode in which the scrutinised text is functioning. A threshold of positivity is reached whenever a discursive practice becomes individualised among others.49 An epistemological thresh- old is reached in turn when some of the units of discourse start to organise themselves coherently and start acting as standards for the corresponding form of knowledge. Other thresholds such as scientific and formal thresholds correspond to other configurations of the discourse analysed by the archeologist.50 The specific temporal order in which they appear is not constant; the steps which lead from one threshold to the next vary from one form of discourse to another. In fact, answering these questions constitutes one of the major tasks of the archeologist.51 At the same time, these thresholds are not meant to distinguish knowledge from science; rather, they determine the kinds of relationships existing between the two, with ideology always present as the mediating factor. * * * "Ibid., p. 241. **Ibid., p. 242.

See p. 271 below.</page><page sequence="20">264 JEAN-CLAUDE GUÉDON Up to this point, I have mainly attempted to demonstrate that Foucault' s way of raising questions was not only significant, but also very different from the approaches generally used by historians of ideas. However, there remains an important question to be raised, one suggested by Foucault' s own method - namely, how legitimate is Foucault' s approach? In other words, what epistemic foundations allow Foucault to speak as he does? As could be expected, the answer to such a question cannot be found entirely in Foucault' s writings, at least not explicitly. In fact, at the end of his Archeology of Knowledge, Foucault expressly states that his 4 'discourse, far from specifying the locus from which it speaks, avoids the ground on which it could lean."52 And indeed, this is a necessary precaution on the part of Foucault, for otherwise his analyses would find themselves co-opted by the very disciplines or, more generally speaking, discourses using the same ground as his. As a result, his critical explorations would transform themselves into the fitting of "facts" into pre-ordained slots, and his whole quest, instead of opening new ground, would simply tend to validate pre- existing discursive strategies. This said, it is nevertheless possible to note that Foucault' s line of questioning intersects with a number of problems raised in other contexts. When archeology, for instance, tries to unveil the kinds of relationships linking subjects with enunciations, it encounters a problem already present in psychoanalysis. But archeology also crosses the path of epistemology when it attempts to specify the rules regulating the formation of concepts; and it also meets the question of social configurations when it deals with the formation of objects - scientific objects, that is - and their emergence within specific fields and institutions.53 Yet, archeology does not coincide with any of these questions, for the general theory it seeks cannot be incorporated in a general psychoanalytical theory, or a theory of epistemology or of sociology; instead, it looks for a problematic general theory of production .54 It may sound paradoxical to say that the overall theory of archeology should be a general theory of production, when it is well known that Foucault focuses much of his attention on problems like rules of formation of types of discourses, possibility of existence of the same, etc. Such problems do lend themselves to being solved by concepts like repetition, duplication and so on. In other words, it would seem that Foucault is led to create a vast generative machine allowing discourses to reproduce over and "Ibid., p. 267. "Ibid., p. 170. 54 Ibid .</page><page sequence="21">MICHEL FOUCAULT 265 over again, and from within.55 In other words again, Foucaulťs questions seem to preclude either the possibility of change, or understanding why change appears when it does; it seems to allow for a proliferation of similar individual discursive practices, and only that. The metaphor of the generative machine, however, is quite misleading in that it brings to mind a false connotation - namely that of such a dynamic necessity that producing a discourse would ultimately seem to be easier than not producing it at all. A discursive configuration would then appear to function in either a mechanical or compulsive fashion. But this metaphor is not Foucaulťs; actually, he argues exactly the contrary: to speak, for him, is to act, and the process of production is always complex and costly.56 The metaphor of the generative machine is misleading in yet another way. Far from denying the possibility of change, Foucault, in point of fact, shows and even underlines the importance of change: the order of a "family" of discourses can be modified, transformed and, to use the word, revolution- ised. And precisely because archeology has focused on the very element constitutive of the order of discourse, it is in an excellent position to evaluate the specificities of a given transformation and the extent to which it affects a given kind of discourse. As a result, archeology can describe change more precisely than any method based on the vague problematics of the history of ideas; moreover, it does so while rejecting any appeal to organising principles such as new ideas, creativity or mentality. Instead, it looks at the transformations taking place within a given practice, or within neighbouring practices.57 The paradox does not stop here: not only is archeology capable of dealing with change better than history of ideas, despite all appearances, but it is in fact difficult to see how history of ideas can analyse or even describe change, except through the manipulation of mythical entities. In the end, far from being on the defensive, Foucault can turn against the opposing historian and ask in his turn: "What is this fear which makes you answer in terms of consciousness when you are addressed in terms of practice, of its conditions, of its historical transformations? What is this fear which . . . makes you look for the great historico-transcendental destiny of the West?"58 His answer is brief and rather significant by the different 55 For a brief, but significant, comparison between archeology and generative grammar, see ibid., p. 269- 70. 56 Ibid., p. 272. 57 Ibid. 58 Ibid., p. 273.</page><page sequence="22">266 JEAN-CLAUDE GUÉDON dimension it injects into the debate: this fear is political in nature.59 At this point, Foucault has actually identified the locus which he had so painstak- ingly avoided before. The question which remains now is the following: how did he find himself speaking from a political stance? What discursive practice made his own discourse appear in this particular mode? In accordance with his own tenets, Foucault opened his inaugural lecture at the Collège de France by invoking a voice, already there, and guiding his own modulations a little like a carrier wave in radio transmissions. That voice, in this particular instance, turned out to be an elegant reference to his predecessor at the Collège, Jean Hippolyte;60 but in actuality, it is a Hippolyte speaking less by himself than being spoken through, for he too is subjected to the rules and regulations of discourse formation. In this particular case, Hippolyte is the man who speaks the crucial response to Hegel - namely, how is it still possible to do philosophy where Hegel is no longer possible?61 Hippolyte' s quest is not specifically his, of course. His own discursive practice intersects with that of other individuals, among whom Marx and Nietzsche are most notorious. Without their prior philosophical interven- tions, Foucault' s and Hippolyte' s own discourses could not have emerged. Let us see how this is the case for Foucault. In the case of Nietzsche, Foucault himself has outlined the connections running from Nietzsche's genealogy to his own archeology.62 If Nietzsche's genealogy is not the twin of archeology, it nevertheless shares with the latter a common opposition to history. For example, genealogy refuses to grant any ideal meaning or teleological implications to a historical narrative.63 Genealogy denies the validity of looking for the essence of things through an investigation of their origin; instead, genealogy demystifies history by showing either that historical objects have no essence, or that their apparent essence is not intrinsic to them, but, in fact, was constructed from elements foreign to them in the first place.64 Genealogy also rejects the notion that a historian could monopolise a synthetic viewpoint permitting him to subsume the past or even part of it under a single, closed totality.65 As an alternative, 59 ibid. 60 Michel Foucault, L'Ordre du discours (Paris: Gallimard, 1971), passim. 61 Ibid., pp. 74-76. 62 Michel Foucault, "Nietzsche, la généalogie, l'histoire," in Hommage à Jean Hyppolite (Paris, PUF, 1971), pp. 145-172. 63 Ibid., p. 146.

What is at stake is far more fundamental than just a filiation of ideas between two thinkers separated by some eighty years of history; what is at stake is the existence of a mode of functioning of signs first encountered in Nietzsche, Marx and Freud and underpinning in a complex way Foucault' s own work.69 In effect, signs have undergone a radical displace- ment with these three thinkers: instead of being passive objects offered to interpretative rituals, signs are actually already interpretative objects in themselves. In a parody of Sartre's famous claim that existence precedes essence, Foucault sees our historical period as one in which "interpretation precedes signs."70 Moreover, signs are interpretations attempting to justify themselves.71 Thus, money gives itself as the sign of value, but Marx shows in Capital that taking money literally at its face-value is to play into the hands of the capitalists since this conception of money occults the process by which surplus-value is extracted from the proletariat. A similar analysis could be carried out in the case of Freud's interpretation of dreams. Finally, Nietzsche argues in the Genealogy of Morals that the idea of good "did not originate among those to whom goodness was shown. Much rather has it been the good themselves, that is the aristocratic, the powerful, the high 66 Ibid., p. 156, p. 161. It is clear that in unravelling the processes producing events like morality, Nietzsche undermines their ability to organise a societal ethos, by showing that far from being universal and eternal categories, they actually belong to specific spatio-temporal units with their attendant societal instances and their modes of relationship. ^ Ibid., p. 163, p. 165. o*Ibid., p. 172. 69 Michel Foucault, "Nietzsche, Freud, Marx," in Nietzsche (Paris: Editions de Minuit, 1967), pp. 183- 192.

It was out of this pathos of distance that they first arrogated to themselves the right to create values for their own profit, and to coin the names of such values."72 Clearly, Nietzsche presents an argument where words already contain in themselves an interpretation of societal order. It is relatively simple to understand now how the Archeology of Knowledge becomes possible: it used to be that the surface of things was duplicated by the surface of signs, and it also used to be that signs were viewed as the trustworthy and neutral tool needed to apprehend things fully. But now, the sign takes on a much more complex appearance as the surface carrying it transforms itself, as it were, into a volume made up of an infinite number of layers piled up on top of each other. What has happened is that the couplet "interpretation-sign," along with the modalities guiding the relationship between interpretation and sign, are now offered simultaneously as a new object-to-be-interpreted. And the process can repeat itself indefinitely. But Foucault refuses to be caught up into this never-ending process characteristic of hermeneutics; and he also refuses to move to the position consisting of the negation of hermeneutics - that being the system- atic description of signs and of their inter-relationships, both being appre- hended from the outside. The latter attitude rests on the assumption that signs exist in themselves and that, as such, they are the proper objects of study of another systematic analysis - namely semiology. Instead, Foucault opts for a third solution, one resting on the same epistemic ground as both hermeneutics and semiology: he retains the semiological project of a systematic description of external relationships, but instead of applying it to signs only, he focuses on both signs and interpretations. Between the sign as interprétons and the sign as interpretandum , Foucault discovers, or rather constructs, the locus for the archeological description of discourse.73 There is another way to formulate this result which may be more telling. Treating signs as neutral reflections of natural objects is to eliminate language in favour of epistemology. Consequently, the archeological ap- proach works in the space between semiology, hermeneutics and epistemol- ogy. And because archeology can function effectively between these three domains, it can act as a meta-discourse for them. In other words, archeology, by its very locus, can claim a critical role with respect to semiology, epistemology and hermeneutics. 72 F. Nietzsche, The Genealogy of Morals (London: T.N.

(n. 61 above), p. 192.</page><page sequence="25">MICHEL FOUCAULT 269 In many ways, the purest attempt to make archeology work exactly as was just described is found in The Order of Things. That is to say that The Order of Things is, paradoxically, Foucault's least successful and most successful book. It is most successful in that it comes closest to a complete archeological description of several contemporary discourses, showing in the process that isomorphic configurations can obtain in widely varied domains like economics and biology. It is least successful in that it ultimately remains simply descriptive, even though this limited result is masked by the great originality of the description and by its scandalous outcome - namely that the object "man," as an object of the so-called human sciences, is a very recent object, bound to disappear in the near future. In the end, archeology could perhaps be critical of semiology, epistemology and hermeneutics, but it could achieve its critical aims only in one way - i.e. by exhibiting cultural objects constructed by the archeological approach. How these enigmatic objects could appear, disappear or even maintain themselves was left in the realm of mysteries. To put it otherwise, in The Order of Things , Foucault had succeeded in identifying an interesting strategic locus for a critical approach, but he had done so at a terrible cost: he could no longer understand the process of emergence of what he was exhibiting. The Archeology of Knowledge can be viewed as Foucault's exploration of the limits of archeological descriptions; but it can also be viewed as the exploration of the non-discursive factors contributing to the production of certain types of discourses. In other words, this book displays a very conscious effort to reorganise the discoveries made in Madness and Civilisation , Birth of the Clinic and The Order of Things and fit them within a coherent scheme. That scheme, while retaining the acquisitions of the archeological method, also introduces the idea of a production of the discur- sive level by the non-discursive level. The phrase "production of the discursive level by the non-discursive level" can be misleading if interpreted simply mechanistically or even as a simple causal relationship. Actually, the process works both ways and is a good deal more complex than a causal relationship, as Foucault explains clearly in his introduction to the publishing of a series of historical documents pertaining to an early nineteenth-century mass murder.74 74 This in itself is extraordinary, given that Pierre Rivière claimed that he was hardly able to read or write. See Moi, Pierre Rivière, ayant égorgé ma mère, ma soeur et mon frère - un cas de parricide au XlXesiècle (Paris: Archives Gallimard, Julliard, 1973), p. 266.</page><page sequence="26">270 JEAN-CLAUDE GUÉDON Documents such as those of the Rivière affair should allow analysing the formation and the interplay of a form of knowledge (such as medical, psychiatric or psychopathologi- cal knowledge) with institutions, as well as the roles prescribed by them (judicial institutions with their experts, accused and criminals, etc.). They allow decyphering the relationships based on power, dominance and struggle, relationships within which discourses are formed and function; they allow, therefore, the analysis of discourses (including even scientific discourses) both at the level of events and of politics, and, therefore, at the level of strategies.75 In this quotation, Foucault is seen as proceeding in two phases: first, starting from documents, as any historian would do, he notes the steps by which certain forms of knowledge are created. In this first phase, he applies an archeological mode of reading76 leading to an archeological description of these documents. In the second phase, Foucault does not deal with documents any more, i.e. the raw materials piled up any which way in libraries; instead, he deals with discourses and examines how they are produced. This he does by treating the non-discursive realm as a system of signs located in the specific social rela- tionships unveiled beyond the edge of the discursive domain.77 These rela- tionships are few and simple: they are power and dominance relationships and they bear the mark of social struggles. Treating the social arena in terms of struggle is not a new theme introduced for the first time by Foucault. But if this point is obvious, it would be equally wrong to say that Foucault simply followed in the footsteps of Hobbes, via Nietzsche or Marx. In Foucault the struggling elements are neither individu- als, nor classes: either solution would reintroduce the kinds of questions solved by the introduction of an active subject. Instead, and this is where Marx becomes crucial for Foucault' s recent studies, the struggle is grounded in the relationship between the productive forces. But, unlike Marx, Foucault does not see the relations of production as being sufficient to account for the proliferation of diversified discourses at different levels. Something else is 75 Ibid., p. 13. Strategies are not to be construed as the expression of the creative powers of an individual; instead they refer to a complex, trans-individual subject made up by the intersection of social, economic, political and libidinal instances. Strategies from the conditions of possibility for particular discursive practices. 76 On theories of reading, consult Karel Williams, "Unproblematic archeology," Economy and Society, 1974, 3 (1), 41-68. In this article, Williams tries to demonstrate that Foucault's Archeology is an attempt to construct a new form of reading, but that it does not stand up to scrutiny due to internal incoherence. 77 G.

In other words, if Marx is crucial to account for Foucault' s recent orienta- tion, he is not sufficient. And if he is not sufficient, it is because Foucault cannot treat a social relationship as a fact. Once again, the treatment of signs which opened up the space for an archeological description of documents, also informs the decyphering of social relationships. Indeed, social relation- ships are signs, but like all signs, their very existence points to their already present interpretative capacity. Power is already informing the sign although it may give itself the appearance of a simple social relationship. In summary, the theory of signs implicitly used by Foucault to open up a space for archeology is found to function again at the non-discursive level. The phrase 4 'technology of power" becomes significant in this respect, for technology is both a technique of power and a reflexion about such a technique: it is at once theory and practice. And it is because of its being both that it can mediate the non-discursive level with its discursive counterpart. * * * Foucault' s later book, Surveiller et punir , ends on a grave note: "... it is necessary," he tells us, "to listen to the roar of battle."78 Yet early signs indicated that his meandering path would ultimately lead him to this conclu- sion.79 Ironically, Foucault' s treatment of texts as social acts, with all the con- sequences that such an interpretation carries with it, was not clearly per- ceived at first. On the Left, he was even flayed as a "desperate positivist" when his Order of Things appeared.80 He himself admits that this particular book could lead to misinterpretations since "the absence of methodological references may have given the impression of analyses carried out in terms of cultural totalities."81 Such criticisms, however, are no longer possible since the appearance of The Archeology of Knowledge and particularly Surveiller et punir with its scathing denunciation of the role prisons play in controlling whole populations.82 By 1972, Foucault was expressing very clearly what the role of an intellectual in society ought to be. For one thing, he says, "what the 78 Surveiller et punir, op. cit. (n. 13 above), p. 315. 19 L'Archéologie du savoir, op. cit.

They [the masses] know pretty well and much better than the intellectuals - and they say it very well."83 Given this state of affairs, Foucault argues that "the role of the intellectual" is no longer to place himself a "little ahead or a bit to the side" so as to speak the silent truth of all. Rather it is a struggle against the forms of power in relation to which he is both object and instrument: within the domain of 'knowledge,' 'truth,' 'consciousness' and 'discourse.' "84 As in the case of Surveiller et punir , Foucault ends his conception of theoretical activity on the note of battle: "... theory will never express, translate or apply a practice: it is a practice. ... It is not a struggle for suddenly attaining consciousness (...) but for undermining and capturing authority with all those who struggle for it, and not by withdrawing in order to enlighten them. A 'theory' is the regional system of this struggle."85 It is interesting to contrast Foucault' s recent pronouncements with one of the most elaborate analyses of his works yet to emanate from American academic circles - namely Hay den White's substantial article which ap- peared in 1973. One year after the 1972 interview, White could find himself writing: "Foucault' s suspicion of reductionism in all its forms is manifested in his professed lack of interest in the relation of a work or a corpus of works to its social, economic and political contexts."86 Instead, so White argues, Foucault believes he has invented a way of treating texts which is really nothing more than paying attention to the rhetorical dimensions of language - a dimension which was lost precisely when science emerged by disengaging itself from rhetoric and which has been obscured ever since because of science's dominant position in the general area of knowledge. But actually, White continues, Foucault only repeats Vico' s own analysis based on the tropological structures of texts,87 and he would be aware of it "if he understood correctly what he has been about."88 After dismissing Foucault in the above manner, White then shows that 83 "The intellectuals and power: A discussion between Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze," Teļos, Summer 1973, 16: 104. This interview was done on March 4, 1972, and was first published in L'Arc. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Hayden V. White, "Foucault decoded: Notes from underground," History and Theory, 1973, 12: 30. White manages to contradict himself, however, when he later writes: "What caused this change? In Foucault' s view, the change had very little to do with the advancement of theoretical knowledge about the true nature of mental illness. Rather, If there was any advancement at all, it came as a result of more basic transformations in society." Ibid., 40 (my emphasis). "Ibid., 48-49. %*Ibid., 49.</page><page sequence="29">MICHEL FOUCAULT 273 Foucault' s works cannot be expected to be read widely in the Anglo- American philosophical community. For one thing, he 44 ... is a metaphysi- cian, however much he may stress his descent from the positivist conven- tion."89 Besides, White adds, he 44does not work within the mainstream of Western historiography."90 The reason why Foucault is not in the mainstream of Western historiogra- phy, according to White, is because, contrary to most historians, Foucault makes the past unfamiliar to us. Unwittingly, White may have a point here: Foucault is indeed trying to demystify history, very much as Marx or Nietzsche did. But perhaps they are not part of the mainstream of Western historiography either; nor are many members of the Annales school who would certainly endorse the notion of the unfamiliar in the past. White could have argued, and indeed did argue, that Foucault is not a normal historian, whatever that may be, because of the way in which he uses (or fails to use) sources.91 But this is hardly a good criticism for, if Foucault treats his sources differently, he does so in accord with his own explicit precepts, which is more than can be said of many historians. Moreover, he generally uses a range of sources sufficiently wide to satisfy even the most demanding historian. The curious thing about White's criticism of Foucault is that one senses that the real point of contention between the two men is never addressed directly. In a way, saying that Foucault has done nothing more than pay attention to the rhetorical dimensions of language, and by adding that Foucault is not very conscious of that fact, White is stating that Foucault' s The Order of Things is little more than a poor attempt at writing White's own Metahistory ,92 But "Ibid., 49. 90 Ibid., 50. 91 White has apparently not read or even looked at the long version of Folie et déraison à l'âge classique, two editions of which exist. This careless attitude allows him to add one more preposterous statement to the long series which I have already referred the reader to in notes 87 through 90. He writes: "From a consideration of a very limited body of data, Foucault purported to contrive a true account of the 'underside' of thought about both 'reason' and 'madness,' ..." ibid., 38. Far more to the point, Michael Peters writes: "The erudition, if one challenges its authenticity (e.g. on the selection of sources) is at least as authentic as anything one will find employed anywhere else to back up more orthodox theses in the history of ideas. The point of saying this is merely to emphasize that to find empirical inaccuracies or gaps in the picture Foucault offers of some four centuries of speculation on the subject of madness cannot be assumed to imply that the orthodox picture rests on any firmer evidence." Peters, op. cit. (n. 9 above), 637. 92 See Hayden V. White, Metahistory - The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth Century Europe (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1973). In that book White argues that historical discourse, unlike scientific discourse, is made possible by a pre-critical, pre-conscious, poetic act constructing a given historical field both in terms of the objects to be found in it and in terms of the tools used to analyse it. As a</page><page sequence="30">274 JEAN-CLAUDE GUÉDON Metahistory argues against history ever having any objective value; rather historians' strategies are dictated by ideology or aesthetics, and those two factors can be read off the rhetorical forms adopted by any given historian. Clearly, White's approach stands in stark contrast to that of Foucault: while the latter sees the intellectual intervening in the political struggles of his own social sphere, the former writes a very large book so as to free the imagination of the historian. Where Foucault sees archeology as a social practice efficacious within specific social configurations (the intellectuals, the universities, etc.), White hopes to see the golden age of nineteenth- century history reappear so that the historian may have again full freedom to frolic among the four tropes, metaphor, metonymy, synechdoche, and irony. In effect, White attacks Foucault, so it seems to me, because the latter thoroughly rejects the notion of an ivory tower, a last asylum for serenity and neutral, but elegant, objectivity. For Foucault, scholars who choose to treat their work as a sacrifice formally placed on the altar of truth and performed for its own sake, according to rules defined internally by the profession,93 must be either deluded, or are perpetuating myths for reasons of their own. If they are deluding themselves, then it is time their eyes be opened. If they are creating myths, then these must be exposed for what they are. This is done by asking some very simple and straightforward questions like, Whom does value-free, neutral history serve? How is it allowed to maintain itself and, specifically, who finances it? These questions relate, painfully to be sure, to the academic institutions, their internal hierarchies, their role in society and particularly their clientele. Ultimately, all of these questions lead to a very fundamental one, rarely posed explicitly within the hushed walls of Academe: we are historians of science for what - and, more to the point, for whom? The archeology of knowledge of Michel Foucault is a critique of the assumptions guiding the work of many historians of science. More funda- mentally, however, it also confronts all of us at the level of values and of our consequence, White argues that there is no way of arguing in favour of this or that historical approach on epistemological grounds; only esthetics or ideology determines the choices used. Consequently, the value of historical discourses does not lie in their being good representations of reality. If histories cannot be judged in terms of their relationship with reality it seems strange to attack Foucault for his bad or insufficient use of sources; if historical writing stems from a pre-conscious act, it also seems strange to attack Foucault for his lack of lucidity. This is why I have the feeling that these arguments are present only to mask the true stakes involved in White's attack to Foucault. 93 In his article on History of Science, T. S. Kuhn, speaking undoubtedly for many of his colleagues, writes: "Like any other scholarly discipline, the field's primary responsibility must be to itself," The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, op. cit. (n. 11 above), vol. 14, p. 81.</page><page sequence="31">MICHEL FOUCAULT 275 motivations for being historians of science. And I suspect that it is on this very point that Michel Foucault will be resisted most vociferously - that is if he can no longer be ignored. Acknowledgments This paper has been made possible thanks to the many discussions which I have enjoyed these last years with many people, in particular with Alain Baudot, Trevor H. Levere and Lewis Pyenson. The reading seminar on Foucault which I had the privilege to lead at The Johns Hopkins University in the course of the Spring term of 1975 was invaluable. Particular thanks are due in this context to François Blanchard, Michael Freedman, Donna Haraway, Pauline Mazumdar and Peter Niebyl. Whatever smoothness of style and lucidity exist in this text, I owe to Elizabeth Fee's careful reading of an earlier draft of this paper, as well as to her (sometimes) gentle intellectual nudgings. Finally, if this paper has any coherence, it is due to Camille Limoges' important critique which led me to rewrite most of the end of this paper in the summer of 1976.
