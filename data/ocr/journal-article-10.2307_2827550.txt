<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHEMICAL DEFENSES OF ARTHROPODS. By Murray S. Blum. Academic Press, New York. $55.00. xii + 562 p.; ill.; empirical formula, animal/plant, and subject indexes. 1981. The author has provided a thorough and current (through 1980) summary of the chemistry of ar- thropod defense secretions. In addition to tabulating all published defensive compounds, Blum pro- vides extensive critical commentary in later chap- ters on chemical systematics, biosynthesis, coevo- lution and detoxication. Proteinaceous venoms of arthropods are also surveyed briefly. A complete reference list, a complete empirical formula index for all chemicals discussed, separate indexes for general subjects and for binomial names of ani- mals and plants make this book an extremely valu-</page><page sequence="2">SEPTEMIBER 1982] NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 343 able reference for all researchers in insect and plant chemical ecology. The error rate in struc- tural formulae is below 1%, which is quite good, and the accuracy of reporting information from the literature is very high. Why, if these crucial features are so overwhelm- ingly positive, can I not be more enthusiastic? First, the first half of the book organizes de- fense chemicals by functional group, This is a ma- jor error in my view, since it lumps together bio- synthetically unrelated compounds, and because it requires arbitrary assignment of multifunc- tional compounds to one group or the other. Ter- pene esters are more related to terpene alcohols than to fatty acid esters, but this and numerous other simple biogenetic considerations are ne- glected in Blum's scheme. This organization leads to some fallacious and misleading statements, such as "It appears that allomonal esters have evolved very selectively in the Arthropoda" (p. 207). It is more likely that minor amounts of es- ters accompany most alcohols, aldehydes, and acids identified as major components. These four chemical groups are closely interrelated and are interconvertible in vivo; separating them as major groups of compounds seems artificial. A more useful and biologically meaningful commentary could have been constructed had the organization centered on insect order, biogenetic derivation, or glandular source. These features are not ne- glected; indeed, the first chapter reviews the main glandular and nonglandular sources, and a later chapter highlights secretions according to insect order. Second, the style becomes oppressive in its ses- quipedalian floridity. The result is that the ob- vious is stated with obscurity, or that keen obser- vations are hidden by clouds of superlatives, hy- perbole, and anthropomorphism. Phrases like "virtuosity of beetles and hemipterans as alde- hydic chemists," and "ants are ketonic biochemists par excellence," are just obfuscatory scrivenery. When Blum is reporting information from the lit- erature and when he is describing new research areas for arthropod defense chemistry, he is lucid and interesting. When he switches to the "over- view" sections, he overwrites. This book should find its way to all chemistry and biology libraries. It is a superb reference and reflects considerable effort in assembling and or- ganizing a vast and rapidly expanding field. It will reach many personal libraries as well, with the caveat that one must ponder the raison d'etre of verbal virtuosity. GLENN D.
