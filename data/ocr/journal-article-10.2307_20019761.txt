<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS 4OI Paul Helm. The Providence of God. Contours of Christian Theology. Pp. 246. (Leicester: Inter-Varsity Press, 1993.) ?12.99. This is a remarkably fine contribution to a series designed 'to rework the orthodox evangelical position in a fresh and compelling way'. One thing is quite clear from a perusal of its contents. There is no such thing as 'the orthodox evangelical position'. The book is aimed at the general reader and forswears technicalities, and it is a paradigm example of how to express and explain a complex and deep theological and philosophical position with clarity and precision. The view of divine providence advanced is very much the author's own. It is certainly consonant with major strands in Scripture and the Christian tradition, but it is one that will provoke strong disagree? ment from many contemporary Christian philosophers and theologians, including many evangelicals. It will be of interest mainly to reflective Christians and students of Christian theology and philosophy of religion. But students of religion too will find it extremely valuable to have what has perhaps become an unfashionable strand in Christian theology so ably represented and defended. Helm's work makes much more sense of the idea of predestination as it occurs in Paul, Augustine, Aquinas and Calvin than one finds with most historical or purely theological treatments of the theme. This advantage follows from the fact that the author is a highly skilled philosopher of religion. The view of divine providence expounded and defended here is the ' no risk ' view, the view, namely, that the whole story of creation from start to finish is providentially ordained in all its detail, including human free action, and including moral and natural evil as well as good. This view is contrasted throughout with the 'risk' view, whereby God is held to have created an open-futured universe, productive of libertarian freedom and theoretically unpredictable to God as well as to ourselves, a world with which God interacts by non-coercive, merely enabling, grace, drawing good out of non intended evil, and inspiring creaturely response and love, in conformity with his ultimate purposes for good. The problems with the 'risk' view are well set out : the distancing from Scripture it necessarily involves, the location of God's action firmly in time, the loss of sovereign divine control, the inevitable divine ignorance, and the apparent uncertainty of the outcome. According to Helm, the 'risk' view involves a playing down of the classical Christian doctrines of fall and redemption, as well as of effective grace. The ' no risk ' view is ably expounded, first by setting out the theological framework, namely God's transcendence and the atemporal dependence on God of the whole space-time continuum, then by chapters on creation, fall and redemption, divine guidance, petitionary prayer, human accountability and, most crucially, the problem of evil. The difficulties are faced fairly and squarely, and it is hard to envisage a better attempt to rescue the 'no risk'</page><page sequence="2">402 RELIGIOUS STUDIES view from its apparent implausibilities. The religious power of conviction that all things come from God and contribute to the overall good of creation, including one's own place in it for all eternity, is also well brought out. It is a pity, however, that the bearing of modern science on a contemporary Christian view of the world is deliberately set aside. Critical comment will be restricted here to the two crucial problems of freedom and evil. The 'no risk' view clearly requires what philosophers call a 'compatibilist' account of human freedom. Freedom and determinism (or in this case predestination) are not incompatible. Libertarian freedom in the strong ' could have done otherwise ' sense is not required for actions to be my own and for me to be held accountable for them. Helm is quite right to say that theological compatibilism raises no more problems than secular com patibilism (cp. Flew and Mackie), but one may suggest in reply that it raises no fewer problems either. Harry Frankfurt's powerful counter-instances to the ' could have done otherwise ' analysis of free will notwithstanding - and Frankfurt himself, it may be pointed out, does not insist on compatibilist conclusions - one may surely urge that we need a stronger sense of freedom, not only for genuine accountability, but for personal existence as such, including responsible thought as well as action. Treating reasons as causes blurs their non-compelling nature, the same being true of inclinations and desires. A genuine person's thoughts and actions cannot simply flow from his or her nature all the time, at least in the ambiguous circumstances in which we find ourselves here on earth. But the greatest difficulty for the ' no risk' view is undoubtedly the problem of evil. Helm is quite frank about this. The 'free will defence' can play no role in his theodicy. Indeed the distinction between moral and natural evil is not important for the ' no risk' view - an admission which reflects adversely on Helm's defence of compatibilist accountability, incidentally. Instead, he advances a 'greater good defence', according to which a world containing sin and evil, including horrendous evil, contributes to a greater overall good in the end than would be possible if creatures were made such that they always did and experienced good. The argument culminates in a defence of the 'felix culpa' idea, which serves to bring out the supreme value of redemp? tion and the fact that this manifests the divine nature in a way in which unrestricted, perfect, love would never do. Wisely, Helm has no truck with the suggestion of certain Dominicans that God's goodness needs no defence, since the Creator of all things can be under no obligations to his creatures. But the defence of God's goodness by the 'greater good defence' strains credibility, when we are asked to believe that evil and suffering, in all their horrendous detail, are 'sent' by God as part of his total ordination of the world story, culminating in the highest good. To make this remotely plaus? ible Helm has to argue that evil, though ordained, is not ordained as evil, but as a means to the greater good. Responsibility for Auschwitz remains with</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 403 human beings. But here the implausibilities of the compatibilist account of freedom combine with the implausibilities of this view of God's ordaining providence. Can one really detach blame from God for ordaining evil by saying that he does not ordain it as evil? It is hard enough for the 'risk' view to employ the 'free will defence' (and the 'free process defence' regarding natural evil) to justify God's 'permission' of evil and disaster. But on Helm's view, one can hardly make the distinction between what it is for God to permit from what it is for God to ordain. Indeed the 'no risk' view comes to grief precisely over this notion of God's 'ordination'. Despite its scriptural roots, it is itself surely too anthropomorphic an analogy for God's creative act (as is the more obviously unacceptable 'potter and clay' analogy). Defenders of the ' risk ' view not only urge that a divine creative act pro? ductive of genuine openness and freedom - thus not 'intending' or 'sending' specific ills, moral or natural, for humankind - is greater than predestinating everything, including evil, but also that it involves a less anthropomorphic conception of God's particular providence in and through the genuinely free acts of his creatures. The paradox of grace and free will is not best solved by insisting on a compatibilist account of freedom. That the moral and religious consequences of the 'no risk' view are somewhat less than benign is shown by the final chapter on ' Reckoning with Providence'. It is all very well to insist on seeing the world as a moral order and on trusting God's providence, come what may. But if we are not allowed to distinguish, in the light of revelation, between what God specifically intends and what God specifically does not intend, and to discern signs of the former in particular strands of world history and forms of social order as well as in particular lives and communities, an ethically dubious quietism is liable to follow. Helm wisely repudiates all attempts to lay bare the future, which, by God's plan, is deliberately hidden from us. We are simply to act in accordance with God's revealed commands and prohibitions and leave the consequences in God's hand. Christian ethicists may well question the ad? equacy of this as a basis for Christian social action. They will surely also distrust a view which makes so much hang on our necessary ignorance of what is supposedly already in toto ordained. This beautifully presented case for the ' no risk ' view does not in the end convince. We surely require a more critical approach to Scripture and tradition, a greater readiness to allow the doctrines of creation and fall to be reformulated in the light of modern science, a more robust sense of libertarian freedom as integral to finite personhood, a more plausible theodicy based on divine permissions necessary to the production of a genuinely open-futured world, and a more powerful ethical vision of how the world might be, given that it does not now conform to God's creative intentions.
