<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rosenzweig's Aesthetic Theory and Jewish Unheimlichkeit* Leora Batnitzky The aesthetic theory in Franz Rosenzweig's Star of Redemption remains a conundrum to Rosenzweig's interpreters, both in terms of its relation to the Jewish philosophical tradition and in terms of its German cultural and philosophical context.1 Can the Star's emphasis on aesthetics be recon- ciled with the Jewish philosophical tradition's, and most particularly with the German-Jewish, aversion to image-making? Does the Star even have a unified aesthetic theory, or are there several aesthetic theories reflected in the three parts of the Star? If the Star can be said to have a unified aesthetic theory, is it significantly different from any of a number of Rosenzweig's Romantic influences, and Schelling's most specifically?2 This essay attempts to address these issues by way of two interrelated claims. First, I argue that the Star's aesthetic theory bears its closest resem- blance to Hermann Cohen's, in form though not in content. Second, recog- nizing this formal affinity between what I label Rosenzweig's and Cohen's ethical monotheisms points to the connection between Rosenzweig's * This essay is part of a larger work, Idolatry and Representation: The Philosophy of Franz Rosenzweig Reconsidered, forthcoming from Princeton UP, 2000.

For Rosenzweig, art shares with Judaism the quality of uncanniness [Unheimlichkeit]. Like so many of his German speaking contemporaries, including Sigmund Freud, Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Martin Buber, Rosenzweig connects being wrenched away from one's "homey place" [Heim] to a feeling of Unheimlichkeit. Unlike his contempo- raries, including Buber, Rosenzweig maintains that the feeling of uncanni- ness not only expresses a general insight into human existence, but is a particularly Jewish contribution to the understanding of human existence. This essay reflects on Rosenzweig's view of Jewish uncanniness as it relates to his assessment of his own cultural context, as developed both in his much misunderstood view of anti-Semitism as well as in the hermeneu- tics of his translation of the Bible into German with Martin Buber. Part I: The Star's Aesthetic Theory: Ethical Monotheistic Overtones Rosenzweig inherits a long tradition of German-Jewish thought that concluded that Judaism must remain stubbornly particular precisely for the sake of Christianity and Christian society. For this important and in fact dominant strand of German-Jewish thought, Judaism's mission to the nations of the world consists in guarding the pure idea of monotheism through an unflagging adherence to the ban on idolatry. Moses Men- delssohn, Heinrich Graetz, Hermann Cohen, and Leo Baeck, to name only the most prominent figures, all argued as Rosenzweig does that Judaism, because of its unmediated relationship with the one, unique God, is philo- sophically superior to Christianity.3 According to these authors, Judaism contributes to world culture by way of the superiority occasioned by its adherence to the ban on idolatry. My suggestion in the first part of this essay is that though Rosenzweig rejects the rationalist premises of the German-Jewish tradition of ethical monotheism, he nonetheless retains its gestures. Rosenzweig's ethical monotheistic gestures are especially evi- dent in his approach to aesthetics and, as I argue in the remainder of the essay, give coherence to his theories of art and politics. 3.

Rosenzweig rejects one of the fundamental premises of the German- Jewish ethical monotheistic tradition: that the second commandment ban on images presents an all-out ban on visual representation. From Men- delssohn to Cohen, German-Jewish thinkers argued that there was no tension between Judaism and reasoned enlightenment, and that in fact the second commandment ban on image-making represented the conflu- ence of the two. It is no coincidence that this German-Jewish philosophi- cal tradition was also hostile to the Kabbalah, with its two-fold emphasis on God's inner life and the individual kabbalist's visualizations of that inner life.4 It is well known that Rosenzweig criticizes this rationalist strand of German-Jewish thought, both in terms of its denial of a living, vibrant Jewish relationship with God and in terms of what he considers its apologetic stance towards German culture and society. It is as much in response to what he perceives as a German-Jewish apologetic for Judaism as it is in response to the question of whether or not God can be represented that Rosenzweig writes toward the end of the Star: it is not human illusion if Scripture speaks of God's countenance and even of his separate bodily parts. There is no other way to express the Truth. Only when we see the Star as countenance do we transcend every possibility and simply see.5 At the core of the Star's aesthetic theory is a revaluation of vision,6 4. See Elliot Wolfson, Through a Speculum that Shines (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1994) for a broad overview of vision in Kabbalah. 5. Stern 470/ Star 422. 6. Recall that Rosenzweig's "Star of Redemption" is a figure as well as a title. Both literally and philosophically, the Star's three parts culminate in the figure of a Star of David. Represented by a triangle that points upward, part one describes a logic of three unrelated elements: god, world, man. In part two, the triangle's point is turned downward, or in the language that the Star borrows from Schelling, inverted, because the elements are now in relation with one another. This realm of relationship, Rosenzweig contends, constitutes the experience of revelation and the world of human language. In part three, the overlapping tri- angles of parts one and two come together to form a Star of David. Judaism and Christianity are together represented by Rosenzweig's Star of Redemption, Judaism forming the inner part of the star, its fire, and Christianity forming the outer part, its rays. In the last pages of the Star, Rosenzweig contends that the truth of the star of redemption coincides with the truth of the divine countenance (Stern 465/ Star 418). See Elliot Wolfson's recent "Facing the Effaced: Mystical Eschatology and the Idealist Orientation in the Thought of Franz Rosenzweig," Journal for the History of Modern Theology 4.1 (1997): 39-81 for more extensive discussions of Rosenzweig's relation to sight in kabbalistic thought.</page><page sequence="4">90 Rosenzweig's Aesthetic Theory which had been devalued precisely by the rationalist, German-Jewish tradi- tion. Like Rosenzweig's own aesthetic theory, this tradition of German- Jewish thought sought to speak to two worlds at once: the Jewish and the German one. Jewish thinkers responded simultaneously to the Jew- ish theological problem of whether God can be represented, as well as to a particular problematic raised by the German Enlightenment: why hadn't Jews contributed historically to culture and art?7 Culminating in Hermann Cohen's claim that Judaism is "ethically one-sided" in regard to culture, German-Jewish thinkers suggested time and time again that it was the Jews' historical task to uphold monotheism precisely by resist- ing the lure of vision.8 Heinrich Graetz, one of the founders of the Wis- senschaft des Judentums, epitomizes this type of argument in his contrast between the pagan and the Jew: To the pagan, the divine appears within nature as something observ- able to the eye. He becomes conscious of it as something seen. In con- trast, to the Jew who knows that the divine exists beyond, outside of, and prior to nature, God reveals Himself through a demonstration of His will, through the medium of the ear. . . . Paganism sees its god, Judaism hears Him.9 It is important to note, however, that Graetz does not discard aesthet- ics entirely. He goes on to claim that due to the ban on image-making, Judaism is the originator of a more sublime aesthetic sensibility: artistic expression also develops differently according to different conceptions of God. The artistic act created in Greek paganism ... the art of sculpture, that lovely fragrant blossom of the pagan form of perception.... Judaism, on the other hand, which perceives its God in the alternatively loud and soft sounds of the movement of the waves, in the rhythm of word sounds ... gave birth to music com- bined with religious poetry.10 Reiterating Graetz's musings on the aesthetic implications of monothe- ism, Hermann Cohen writes: 7.

This peculiarity consists in the lyric poetry of the psalms, which sing nei- ther of God alone nor of man alone. Plastic art, however, can only present an isolated depiction of both. Thus plastic art would have impeded the lyric style, for which the relation of God and man becomes the problem of its monotheistic aim.11 Cohen attests to the ethical superiority of biblical aesthetics and is even more explicit than Graetz: "prophetic monotheism is necessarily opposed to, necessarily contradicts art."12 The Star's embrace of vision attacks Graetz and Cohen's wissen- schaftlich polemic at its very core: the assumption that the Bible main- tains that God cannot be represented.13 Rosenzweig argues that "the problem of anthropomorphism" is not a problem but a category error created by German-Jewish rationalists. As he would articulate most clearly in his 1928 "A Note on Anthropomorphism," Rosenzweig argues that the rationalist strand of the German-Jewish philosophical tradition is tantamount to a denial of a living relationship between the Jewish peo- ple and the God of Israel.14 Rosenzweig argues that German-Jewish thinkers had too often tried to turn the dynamic tension of the German- Jewish Zweistromland [land of two streams] - the title of the only col- lection of Rosenzweig's essays published during his life time - into a single stream that denied the vitality of two incomparable and incom- mensurable traditions. Indeed, Rosenzweig maintained that the German- Jewish relation gained its creativity precisely because the two sides of the hyphen could not be synthesized or, in Cohen's terms, correlated.15 Rosenzweig in fact concludes the Star by reversing Graetz's and Cohen's dichotomy between seeing and hearing: "But what he gave me 11.

The Star's embrace of vision is coupled with an aesthetic theory in each of the three parts of the Star. This aesthetic theory, moreover, is not incidental. As Rosenz- weig himself boldly claims, "Of everything empirical, art alone is essen- tial."17 The Star in fact elevates art to a status higher than thought; the pagan, Rosenzweig's argues, is wiser than the modem philosopher for he recognizes his finitude. This wisdom is wiser than the thought of all philosophers, and is precisely the wisdom of the pagan's art. But while Rosenzweig does indeed elevate vision to a status higher than hearing, and art to a status higher than thought, it is a mistake to conclude that what the Star has to say about vision and the Star's aes- thetic theory is also a rejection of the German-Jewish argument for the unique world-historical mission of the Jewish people. On the contrary: it is precisely in connection to what the Star has to say about aesthet- ics, and how the Star makes its argument, that the full import of Rosen- zweig's argument about the Jewish people is to be found. Despite, and also in a perhaps surprising way because of what the Star has to say about vision, the Star is an ethically monotheistic text in the tradition of Hermann Cohen. As one historian of ideas puts it, ethical monotheism is "a religious concentration and intensity that focuses singular atten- tion on God in contrast to all creaturely reality." At the same time, the ethical monotheist maintains "an inclusive interest in culture and soci- ety and insist[s] that ethical monotheistic faith energizes the construc- tion of culture."l18 Rosenzweig is an ethical monotheist for two, interconnected reasons. First, he argues for a particular Jewish theologi- cal mission to the nations and, second, he links this mission with a spe- cific Jewish relation to art and culture. Like German-Jewish ethical monotheists before him, Rosenzweig seeks to elucidate the ethical implications of monotheism for culture at large. First, it is important to note that Rosenzweig shares with Graetz the equation of the pagan and vision. Unlike his German-Jewish counter- parts, however, Rosenzweig assigns the pagan and vision not a wholly 16. Stern 471/ Star 424. 17. Stern 212/ Star 190. 18.

For Rosenzweig, the pagan and vision have an important share in truth. The Greek pagan is wiser than the modem philosopher because she knows that her death cannot be comprehended. However, the pagan is isolated by her recognition of her finitude. Rosenzweig argues that only speech, or revelation, can produce real communication. However, Rosenzweig maintains that art is the silence before speech. In fact, ancient Greek drama anticipates the giving and receiving of human interaction.19 The Star contends that communication through silence is the essence of Attic drama, a sugges- tion with which Walter Benjamin would later concur.20 By keeping silent, the tragic hero becomes an image for his audience, thereby allowing each member of the audience to recognize her own finitude in that image. For Rosenzweig, art's ability to produce commonality but not community accounts for what he refers to as "the magic flute of art" as well as for what he argues is the inherent limitation of art.21 The crucial point here is that Rosenzweig is critical of the pagan's embrace of vision only because it doesn't go far enough. While "Art is not a real world, for the threads which are drawn from man to man in it run only for moments," art "provides the ground on which the self can grow up elsewhere."22 Rather than discounting the pagan valorization of vision, Rosenzweig argues that the Greek/pagan relationship to vision is an achievement for all of humanity, one which he contrasts to the "failures" of both Indian and Chinese civilization: "They [India and China] are the two poles of the worldliness which cannot muster that courage for clarity of vision [Schau] to which alone the configuration of things is revealed."23 The Greek/pagan relation to vision is an achieve- ment precisely because it, in Rosenzweig's words, "provides the ground on which the self can grow up elsewhere." Vision and art produce the commonality that is the prerequisite for universal community. Where then is this "elsewhere" where the self can grow up? Rosenzweig contrasts the pagan's recognition of his finitude, a recogni- tion that is painful and solitary, to the Christian's recognition of finitude, 19. Stern 83-84/ Star 77. 20.

Christian arts are unique because they are the only arts which can wholly cure him of that disease of alienation from the world which plunged the art lover into the misleading delu- sion of supreme health just as he exposed himself defenselessly to the disease. Thus art is its own anti-toxin. It decontaminates itself, and man, from its own purity. From demanding sweetheart it turns into good wife, strengthening him for the market-place and the important hours of life with a thousand small everyday kindnesses and domestic duties, and thereby first flowering into the small, mature beauty as lady of the house. Art is its own anti-toxin in that art has the ability to cleanse itself of the disease that it itself creates: separation and isolation from reality. Art detoxifies itself through the creation not just of commonalty, but of community. Rosenzweig argues that it is thus the images that are cre- ated by Christianity, and the image of the cross in particular, that allow for the creation of Christian community. Rosenzweig's argument that Christian images have redemptive poten- tial seems to cut against the grain of Cohen's, Graetz's, Mendelssohn's, and Baeck's arguments (to name only the best-known advocates of this thesis) about the superiority of Judaism to Christianity. Rosenzweig is certainly unique among Jewish thinkers, and German-Jewish thinkers in particular, in valorizing Christian images. Nonetheless, as most of his interpreters, both Christian and Jewish, have failed to recognize, Rosen- zweig's positive assessment of Christian images and art is intimately connected to his deep awareness of the lethal potentiality of Christian anti-Semitism.26 It is in fact at the intersection of the positive potential of images and the lethal possibilities of anti-Semitism that we can locate Rosenzweig's ethically monotheistic argument. The problem with Christianity for Rosenzweig is not, as Hermann Cohen in particular contends, that it makes images, but rather that it tends to understand its images as lasting ones. Rosenzweig contends that the Christian is 24. Stern 420/ Star 377. 25. Stern 393/ Star 354. 26.

For Rosenzweig, this sense of accomplishment is the idolatry of a lasting image.28 Images are dangerous for the same reason that they are vital. While they make new realities possible, they constantly run the risk of idolatrously denying the very source of their power: the ever- new will of God to move the world toward redemption. In the face of an argument for the world-redemptive potential of the image of the cross, Rosenzweig contends that it is the Jewish mission to guard Christianity against idolatry: And withal: the Jew does it. Not with words, for what would words still avail in this realm of vision! But with his existence, his silent existence. This existence of the Jew constantly subjects Christianity to the idea that it is not attaining the goal, the truth, that it ever remains - on the 27. "A Note on Anthropomorphism," Zweistromland 741. 28. As his translation, with Martin Buber, of the Hebrew Bible would reflect, the second commandment ban on images is not a Bildverbot, but a much more limited prohi- bition. The second commandment, according to Rosenzweig, bans the denial of God's ever-new will. Buber and Rosenzweig's translation of Exodus 20:4 reflects Rosenzweig's view of the ban on images as a limited ban: Nicht mache dir; Schnitzwerk noch irgend Gestalt des, was im Himmel ring- soben, was aufErden ringsunten, was im Wasser ringsunter der Erde ist, [Do not make any wood carvings or any figure whatsoever of that which is (all around) above in heaven, that which is (all around) below on the earth, and that which is (all around) in the waters beneath the earth.] This notion of a more limited scope of the ban on images becomes all the more clear when contrasted with Luther's translation: Du sollst dir kein Bildnis noch irgend ein Gleichnis machen, weder des, das oben im Himmel, noch des, das unten auf Erden, oder des, das im Wasser unter der Erde ist. [You shall make no portrait nor any analogy whatsoever, neither of that which is above in heaven nor that which is below on the earth, nor that which is in the waters beneath the earth.] Luther's translation prohibits any and all attempts at image-making, while Buber and Rosenzweig's translation prohibits only certain sorts of images: those which remain fixed and permanent.</page><page sequence="10">96 Rosenzweig's Aesthetic Theory way. That is the profoundest reason for the Christian hatred of the Jew, which is heir to the pagan hatred of the Jew. In the final analysis, it is only self-hate, directed by his existence; it is hatred of one's own imperfection, one's own not-yet. By his inner unity, by the fact that in the narrowest confines of his Jewishness the Star of Redemption none- theless still bums, the Jew involuntarily shames the Christian.... 29 While the Star has elevated vision above both thought and hearing, Rosenzweig concurs with the German-Jewish rationalists that the Jew must guard Christianity precisely against vision! The Jew's existence shames the Christian and the realm of beauty that he has built for him- self. But the Star's argument about the Jewish mission to the nations goes even further. Rosenzweig concurs in particular with Hermann Cohen in attributing Jewish suffering to Christianity's failure to achieve pure monotheism. In connection with the above comment about Chris- tian self-hatred, Rosenzweig suggests that it is the Jewish mission to suffer for pure monotheism: Israel intercedes with him [God] in behalf of the sinning peoples of the world and he afflicts Israel with disease so that those other peoples may be healed. Both stand before God: Israel, his servant, and the kings of the peoples .., so inextricably twined that human hands can- not untangle them.3? Rosenzweig's words echo Cohen's statement that "As Israel suffers, according to the prophet, for the pagan worshipers, so Israel to this very day suffers vicariously for the faults and wrongs which still hinder the realization of monotheism."31 Though Rosenzweig does not deny vision its due, he nonetheless defines Judaism as that which resists vision for the sake of the redemption of the world. Rosenzweig draws on the image of the blindfolded synagogue to make his argument about Judaism's unique relation to vision. In a 1916 letter to Eugen Rosenstock, he writes: "Is not part of the price that the Synagogue must pay for the blessing in the enjoyment of which she anticipates the whole world, namely, of being already in the Father's presence, that she must wear the bandages of unconsciousness over her eyes?"32 This 29.

Rosenzweig maintains that the synagogue does indeed "wear bandages of unconsciousness over her eyes," but these bandages of unconsciousness mark not an ignorance of God's revelation but rather an excess of it. In the context of the Star's argument about art, the point is that the blindfolded synagogue does not require vision - indeed it is blind - precisely because it is a true image of God's revelationfor the Christian world. Rosenzweig's understanding of art differs in content from typical eth- ically monotheistic arguments. Again, he believes that vision and images are necessary for the formation of human community. How- ever, Rosenzweig's argument duplicates in form the ethically monothe- istic insistence that Judaism preserves pure monotheism by resisting art. Indeed, the form of this ethically monotheistic argument dominates the very structure of the Star. Every part of the Star except for one has a theory of art; only part one of book three, "The Fire, or The Eternal Way," has no aesthetic theory. It is in this part of the Star that Rosenz- weig describes the uniqueness of the Jewish community. In fact, Rosen- zweig's famous, or infamous, claim that Judaism is a community constituted by blood should be understood in the context of this ethical monotheistic argument about Judaism and art. Rosenzweig maintains that Judaism does not require art, for the Jewish community is consti- tuted by blood: "There is only one community ... which cannot utter the 'we' of its unity without hearing deep within a voice that adds: 'are eternal.' It must be a blood-community, because only blood gives war- rant to the hope for a future."33 Though Rosenzweig does not believe, like Cohen, that all images are shameful, the Star of Redemption none- theless argues for the "ethical one-sideness" of Judaism in regard to cul- ture. As his interpretation of the suffering servant shows, Rosenzweig, in accord with the German-Jewish argument for the Jewish mission to the nations, suggests that the Jewish people both abstain from art and suffer for the sake of the realization of pure monotheism.34 Part II: Aesthetic Consequence: Jewish Unheimlichkeit While the implication of the Star's argument is that Jews do not require art, Rosenzweig nonetheless argues that Jews and Judaism have 33. Stern 331/ Star 298-99. See Batnitzky, Idolatry and Representation, chapters 3 and 7 for a more extended argument about how the "blood community" functions in the Star. 34. This does not mean that Rosenzweig believes that individual Jews abstain from art, but only that the ideal of Judaism does.</page><page sequence="12">98 Rosenzweig's Aesthetic Theory aesthetic characteristics, all of which share the quality of Unheimlich- keit. In the next section, I discuss the ways in which this notion of Unheimlichkeit connects Rosenzweig's theory of Judaism to his aes- thetic theory. Here, however, I would like to continue to focus on Rosenzweig's ethical monotheistic gestures and the way in which his argument for the Jewish mission to the nations is simultaneously an argument for diaspora Jewish existence. As Rosenzweig makes clear in the first book of the Star's third part, Judaism is a blood community precisely because it is not a community constituted by land. Because of its unique relation to God's revelation, the Jewish community is wrenched away from its homeland [Heimat] and thereby produces a feeling of Unheimlichkeit in the Heim of others.35 In notes for a 1920 lecture at his Lehrhaus on "The Jewish Person," Rosenzweig makes the connection between the Jewish mission to the nations and Jewish uncanniness explicit: "The Jewish people is a sign and miracle, the indi- vidual Jew is uncanny."36 We saw in the last section what Rosenzweig means when he argues that the Jewish people is a sign and miracle. Judaism, he maintains, is the embodiment of God's revelation on earth. Simply put, Judaism makes the redemption of the world possible. Once again it is on the issue of rationalism that Rosenzweig parts ways with the German-Jew- ish mission theory (and not on the issue of the mission itself). Rosenz- weig contends that the Jew's uncanniness can be a catalyst either for world redemption or for lethal anti-Semitism. Unlike Cohen and Men- delssohn in particular, Rosenzweig argues that anti-Semitism is not something that reasoned enlightenment will overcome. Rather, anti- Semitism is part and parcel of the sign and miracle of the Jewish peo- ple. While Rosenzweig argues that the Jew does not require vision, the Jew nonetheless is an image for the Christian. The Jew appears to the Christian, and he appears as uncanny, as being without a home. The Star suggests that the anti-Semite rightly recognizes the Jew's homeless position and the aesthetic characteristics it produces. Rosenz- weig agrees with Wagner that the aesthetic consequences of Jewish dif- ference, of Jewish uncanniness, are unsettling to the non-Jew. Let us recall briefly Wagner's infamous description of the European reaction to the Jew: 35. Stern 333, 371, 270/ Star 300, 334, 243. 36. Zweistromland 559.</page><page sequence="13">Leora Batnitzky 99 The Jew - who, as everyone knows, has a God all to himself - in ordinary life strikes us primarily by his outward appearance, which, no matter to what European nationality we belong, has something dis- agreeably foreign to that nationality. Rather than suggesting that the eternity of the Jewish people means something different than Wagner contends, Rosenzweig completely agrees with Wagner's description: "the true eternity of the eternal peo- ple must always be alien and vexing to the state, and to the history of the world.'"38 Like Wagner, Rosenzweig connects Jewish speech to the Jew's innate inability to become part of the nation in whose midst he dwells. Wagner states that Throughout an intercourse of two millennia with European nations, culture has not succeeded in breaking the remarkable stubbornness of the Jewish naturel as regards the peculiarities of Semitic pronuncia- tion. The first thing that strikes our ear as quite outlandish, and unpleasant, in the Jew's production of the voice-sounds, is a hissing, shrieking, buzzing snuffle [Ein zischender, schrillender, summsender und murksender Lautausdruck].39 And Rosenzweig concurs: While every other people is one with its own language, while that lan- guage withers in its mouth the moment it ceases to be a people, the Jewish people never quite grows one with the languages it speaks. Even when it speaks the language of its host, a special vocabulary, or, at least, a special selection from the general vocabulary, a special word order, its own feeling for what is beautiful or ugly in the lan- guage, betray that it is not its own.40 Finally, both Rosenzweig and Wagner agree that the Jew's relation to the soil, or lack thereof, is responsible first and foremost for the unnatu- ralness, indeed, the homelessness of Jewish language. Where Rosenzweig and Wagner disagree, and indeed where Rosenz- weig and the anti-Semite disagree, is not in terms of a description of the 37.

An understanding of the eternal potency, and indeed even necessity, of anti-Semitism is part and parcel of Rosenz- weig's theory of the Jewish mission to the nations: The unique characteristic of the people is this: that it looks at itself in about the same way as the outside world looks at it. A whole world asserts that the Jewish people is outcast and elect, both; and the Jewish people . .. only confirms it. Except that seen from the outside, the characterization assumes the form of external connectedness [eines dufjerlichen Zusammenhangs], while from within it represents an inner inseparableness [eine innere Untrennbarkeit], and the vessels of curse and blessing communicate so closely that the latter can overflow only when the former too is full to the brim.41 Rosenzweig maintains that blessings and curses flow equally from Juda- ism for the same reason: due to its uncanny quality, its Unheimlichkeit, Judaism invites a response from its neighbors. Judaism is both of this world and not of this world. Judaism is at one and the same time a sign of mystery beyond this world and the very disturbance to the gentile Heim of this world. Rosenzweig's views of the uncanny effect of a secret hiddenness revealed call to mind Freud's much remarked upon essay on the uncanny, written in 1919, the same year Rosenzweig finished the Star. It does not seem that Rosenzweig knew Freud's essay; he certainly did not know it before he wrote the Star. As is well known, in his essay, Freud discusses the strange and complex interconnection between the words Geheimnis [secret], unheimlich [uncanny], and heimlich [homey, canny]. Freud quotes Schelling's definition of "Unheimlich" - "'Unhe- imlich' is the name for everything that ought to have remained ... hid- den and secret and has become visible," "To veil the divine, to surround it with a certain Unheimlichkeit"'42 - and reformulates it as a kind of repression: "for this uncanny is in reality nothing new or foreign, but something familiar and old-established in the mind that has been 41.

Recently, Daniel Boyarin has maintained that we should understand Freud's essay on the uncanny in connection with Freud's ambivalence about his Jewishness:44 we are led to the conclusion that seeing himself in the mirror pro- duced in Freud the same feeling of uncanniness that he himself claims is produced in the antisemite who looks at the Jew. It is him- self that Freud dislikes.45 Boyarin contends that Freud's notion of the uncanny and his under- standing of Jewishness is fraught with ambivalence about Judaism's sta- tus in the modem world.46 Rosenzweig agrees with what Boyarin claims is Freud's connection between Jewishness and Unheimlichkeit, but Rosenzweig disagrees with the valuation of this connection. Rosenzweig transvalues this phenome- non and argues that Jews are always being wrenched away from the world by God's revelation (are made Unheimlich) for the sake of the world. Interpreting Wittgenstein on the uncanny, G. F. Beam suggests that the uncanny is "the presence of what ought to be absent."'47 Rosen- zweig again agrees with this description and revalues it in terms of the Jewish mission to the nations: he argues that Jews represent God's pres- ence, a presence that seems like it ought to be absent from human life. Jews are uncanny for this very reason. 43. Freud, "The 'Uncanny'" 394. 44. Daniel Boyarin, Unheroic Conduct (Berkeley: U of California P, 1997) 234-35.

Recall Heidegger's def- inition in Being and Time of "das Man," translated as "the they": Everyone is the other, and no one is himself. The they, which supplies the answer to the question of the who of everyday Dasein, is the nobody to whom every Dasein has always already surrendered itself in its Being-among-one-another.48 In these 1920 lecture notes, Rosenzweig makes an argument that is both similar to and different from Heidegger's. Rosenzweig writes: "They [Jews] are after all 'so different.' Indeed, admittedly different. And pre- cisely in their difference - uncanny. They are more different than 'one' is [Sie sind verschiedener als 'man' ist]."49 Rosenzweig maintains that Jew- ish difference is so extreme that it calls the sameness of the masses, of 'the they,' into question.50 Rosenzweig argues that Jewish difference in particu- lar, and not Dasein more generally, disrupts the anonymity of "the they." In his 1922 1 and Thou, Buber describes what he calls the uncanny shattering of the I-It world in terms that are much closer to Heidgegger's musings on the uncanny and "das Man," than they are to Rosenzweig's: There are two basic privileges of the It-world. They induce man to consider the It-world as the world in which one has to live and also can live comfortably - and even offers us all sorts of stimulations and excitements, activities and knowledge. In this firm and wholesome chronicle the You-moments appear as queer lyric-dramatic episodes. Their spell may be seductive, but they pull us dangerously to extremes, loosening the well-tied structure, leaving behind more doubt than satisfaction, shaking up our security - altogether uncanny [eben unheimlich], altogether indispensable.51 48.

Empha- sis added.</page><page sequence="17">Leora Batnitzky 103 Where Rosenzweig differs from both Heidegger and Buber is in insist- ing that it is Jewish particularity - and not a generic component of human existence - that provides insight into this fundamental mean- ing. As I have argued throughout this essay, it is here that Rosenz- weig's ethical monotheistic gestures are most clear. For Rosenzweig, Jewish uncanniness brings to the world both the recognition of human finitude and the possibility of world redemption. Rosenzweig contends that the disruption of Jewish difference is experienced as uncanniness by 'the they' and the Jewish people alike. He goes so far as to argue that uncanniness, the experience of being non-homey, defines the ulti- mate unity and destiny of the Jewish people: What is it then with this unity [of the Jewish people]? It is actually ungraspable. Psychologically ungraspable.... psycho- logically ungraspable. ... But also intellectually ungraspable ... There is no "Jewish intellectuality." All other peoples have better bodily, soulful, intellectual characteris- tics than we do. It is graspable only as the unity of destiny [Schick- salseinheit].... 52 Rosenzweig argues that the unease and disruption of the canny, of the homey place, is precisely what Jewish revelation offers to the world.53 Jews are different because they are without a home in the world; they thereby disrupt the "homey" sameness of others. Part III: A Hermeneutical Critique of Idealist Aesthetics An appreciation of Rosenzweig's view of the dynamics of uncanni- ness is the key to understanding the content of the Star's complex and often seemingly obscure aesthetic theory. For Rosenzweig, an art- work's value is measured in terms of its ability to produce a response from its audience. Rosenzweig characterizes this shocked attention pro- duced by art as Unheimlichkeit. Rosenzweig's notion of Unheimlichkeit 52. Zweistromland 560. 53. In the context of Wittgenstein's thought, Beam captures the general characteris- tic of the uncanny that Rosenzweig ascribes not to experience in general, but to the experi- ence of the Jewish people in particular. Beam writes: "A canny place is where it is easy, as Wittgenstein might have put it, to know your way about. It is homey. Thus an un-canny place is one that unsettles our attempt to find our way about. It is not homey. To this extent, the un-canny repeats the semantic space of its German relation: Das Un-heimliche" ("Wittgenstein and the Uncanny" 33-34).</page><page sequence="18">104 Rosenzweig's Aesthetic Theory links his theories of art and Judaism. Against idealist aesthetics, Rosen- zweig maintains that artworks have the capacity to draw shocked atten- tion from their audiences. When we take Rosenzweig's aesthetic theory together with his theory of Judaism, it becomes clear that the implica- tion of the Star's argument is that Judaism is God's artwork given to the world for the sake of the world's response. Let us return then to the Star's aesthetic theory. Part one describes an aesthetic theory related to paganism, part two an aesthetics of experi- ence, and part three an aesthetics of Christianity. How, if at all, are these theories related to each other? Though Rosenzweig does not use the term "hermeneutic" to describe his aesthetic theory, I suggest that the Star's aesthetic theory is hermeneutical because its underlying and unifying premise is that art deeply affects our self-understanding. While Rosenzweig replaces one methodology for the next as he moves from one part of the Star to the next, art is the one constant that remains. Art's function remains the same in all three parts of the Star, and only the theories of art change. Rosenzweig argues that art is essential to human existence because art is self-creation and self-interpretation. In this sense, art is at bottom hermeneutically oriented. Art expresses the self-creation of individual and community. We have already discussed briefly the aesthetic theories of parts one and three: that of paganism and that of Christianity. The aesthetic the- ory of part one of the Star focuses on what the pagan gets right. Rosenz- weig maintains that the pagan rightly recognizes her finitude and creates her art in an attempt to create the only eternity available to her.54 Rosen- zweig maintains that all art, and not just ancient Greek art, mirrors the non-relational, self-contained world of Greek mythology.55 But while art epitomizes a sense of isolation and self-containedness, Rosenzweig argues that art betrays its own isolation. Art's isolation points to some- thing beyond itself. In Stephane Moses's words, art for Rosenzweig is communication without exchange.56 It is in the context of these pro- found truths that we can approach Christian art, argues Rosenzweig in part three of the Star. Prior to revelation, the human being is isolated. Revelation creates the possibility of true communication - also known as speech - not only between the human and the divine but also 54.

Rosenzweig maintains that Christian art aids in the production of inter-human relations, while both preserving and tran- scending the truth of human finitude. He argues that the Christian com- munity literally comes to know and be itself through its art. Once again, through his silence about the Jewish relation to art, the form of Rosenz- weig's ethical monotheistic argument emerges. The Jewish community, Rosenzweig argues, does not require art for its identity formation, for the Jewish community is formed by and through Jewish blood. What then of the aesthetic theory in part two of the Star? While argu- ing that the pagan is indeed idolatrous in his relation to art, Rosenz- weig is, as we have seen, ambivalent about paganism, as well as about Christianity (which, for Rosenzweig, always remains pagan). Rosenz- weig, however, is not ambivalent about idealism's relation to art and this unambiguous criticism is the subject of part two's aesthetic theory. Rosenzweig's hermeneutical criticism of idealism is intimately con- nected to his understanding of Judaism's relation to the modem world. Rosenzweig maintains that idealism's denial of the hermeneutical aspect of art, the way in which artworks may transform our identities, is part and parcel of idealism's denial of the possibility of the difference reve- lation produces in general, and of Jewish difference in particular. One of the (many) confusing aspects of the philosophical argument of the Star is what Rosenzweig actually means by "idealism." The Star's criticism of "idealism" is multi-layered and Rosenzweig uses the term in many places, often with different connotations. The Star claims that ide- alism is historically unique not only in its claims for cognition (the sub- ject of part one), but also in its claims for the redemptive possibilities of art (the subject of part two) and the modem state (the subject of part three). In parts one and three, "idealism" refers to either Hegel or Cohen. In part two of the Star, however, I suggest that "idealism" refers specifically to Schelling's idealism. Recall Schelling's statement in his System of Transcendental Idealism that art is "the only true and eternal organ and document of philosophy."57 It is Schelling, and not Hegel, who, for Rosenzweig, apotheosizes art in the modem world in a manner far more idolatrous than any pagan had.58 While in part one of the Star, Rosenzweig uses Schelling's claims about myth to undercut Hegel's and Cohen's claims for cognition, the theory of revelation in part two seeks 57.

Stern 163/ Star 146.</page><page sequence="20">106 Rosenzweig's Aesthetic Theory to show the limitation of aesthetics qua aesthetics.59 As we will see, this idealist apotheosization of art is for Rosenzweig intimately connected to a denial in the modem world of Judaism's redemptive powers. Rosenzweig summarizes what he takes to be the uniqueness of the idealist - read Schelling's - approach to art: Idealism lacked straightforward confidence in language . . . at the moment when it rejected language, [it] apotheosized art ... instead of believing ... speech, Idealism threw the whole weight of its gullibility onto a single limb torn loose from the whole body of humanity. For art is no more than one limb, a limb without which, it is true, man would be a cripple, but remain withal. It is one limb among many. Man is more.60 As part two elaborates at length, the human ability to speak and to be spoken to constitutes the wholeness of humanity, for Rosenzweig. Art is part of this whole, but not all of it. Idealism's error is a pernicious one, Rosenzweig argues. It threatens to destroy the essential marker of the human being: the ability to speak, to be spoken to, and to respond. This is also the ability to be affected. Rosenzweig claims that idealism's denial of human response-ability goes hand in hand with a denial of the human ability to be affected and changed. Methodologically, Rosenzweig argues idealism's denial of speech is linked to idealism's denial of contingency: art became for Idealism the great justification of its procedure .... Ide- alism was incapable of acknowledging the word of man as answer to the word of God, and refused to repose confidence in it. Yet it gave this same confidence to a work of man. .... instead of believing this speech, Idealism threw the whole weight of its gullibility onto a single limb torn loose from the whole body of humanity.61 Rosenzweig's criticisms call to mind Schelling's Philosophy of Art, in which Schelling claims that the universe itself is "an absolute work of art."62 59. Rosenzweig's use of Schelling's thought first to establish a truth and then to show the limitation of that truth is actually quite consistent with the structure of the Star. Part two's aesthetic theory rests upon the truth of paganism developed in part one. But the theory of revelation of part two, which is one and the same with Rosenzweig's theory of language, seeks to show the limitation of aesthetics qua aesthetics.

This means not only that nature and ethics are united in art, but that the real and the ideal, and necessity and freedom are as well. Schelling maintains that God is the immediate, absolute, and formal cause of art and that art forms reproduce "forms of things as they are in God."63 As Rosenzweig states, Schelling's method and theory of art are one and the same: art is the ulti- mate reality, conforming to nature and produced by the mind. Rosenzweig seeks in part two of the Star to dismantle Schelling's ide- alist aesthetic theory. It is in here that the form and content of Rosenz- weig's theories of art and Judaism converge around the issue of uncanniness. Part two of the Star attempts to dismantle idealism by way of its very foundation: its theory of art. Rosenzweig argues that ideal- ism's theory of art fails on its own terms, by way of its own "catego- ries." He suggests that idealism's aesthetic theory is plausible for the categories artist and artwork, but that it is simply false for the notion of redemption, even conceived as category. Rosenzweig maintains that idealist aesthetics betrays itself in its denial of the contingency of the audience's response to an artwork. Despite what the idealist philoso- pher might argue, art does and must enter the world: "The shadow realm of art, which was supposed to deceive Idealism about the lifeless- ness of its own world - it longs for life itself."64 Rosenzweig con- tends that art's longing for life is realized in the category of redemption in which the artwork becomes public property. In becoming public property art moves out of the world of shadows and into the world of the living.65 Idealism's dialectic is destroyed by the spectator who remains separate and different from the artist and whatever intentions the artist might bring to the artwork. The separateness of the audience constitutes the contingency of response that art brings into human life. Rosenzweig's description of the artwork parallels his description of the Jewish people. Against idealist aesthetics, Rosenzweig maintains that the artwork is wrenched away from its homey place and thus produces a feeling of uncanniness: "Yes, it is truly uncanny; it has no home, no dwelling; it does not know the shelter of a genus where it might settle comfortably."66 Like the blindfolded synagogue, the artwork produces a 63.

In art's most complete, self-contained moment - when the painting is finished and displayed, when the curtain comes down on a play - the audience may respond to it. Again like the blindfolded synagogue, art becomes part of that which it sought to escape - life itself - through its self-con- tained isolation. Rosenzweig argues that artistic meaning - like the meaning of Jewish existence - is possible only when the artwork is wrenched away from its home. Art and Judaism are both isolated from life and capable of entering into life for one and the same reason: they are un-heimlich. "The work of art stands there unique, detached from its originator, uncanny in its vitality which is full of life and yet alien to life [unheimlichen lebensvollen und doch lebensfremden Leben- digkeit]."67 Rosenzweig argues that because they are uncanny, because they are wrenched away from their "homey" places, artworks, like Juda- ism, affect the human being. The Star thus presents an aesthetic theory that rests upon a hermeneu- tical critique of idealist aesthetics: In the spectator, the empty humanity of the author has coalesced with the Unheimlichkeit of the work rich in content and full of animation. Without the spectator, the work would be mute, since it does not 'speak' to the author.69 The un-heimlich quality of the artwork makes it possible for the art- work to speak to the spectator. Against idealist aesthetics, Rosenzweig contends that the meaning of the artwork is found in what the artwork says to its audience, and not in the artist's intentions. Perhaps a bit iron- ically, Rosenzweig suggests that Wagner's success as a composer is reflected not "by Bayreuth but by the fact that names like Elsa and Eva became fashionable, and that the ideal of woman as redeemer colored the nature of masculine eroticism in Germany for decades."69 Part I1: Conclusion: Rosenzweig's 'Uncanny' as a Return to Jewish Difference By way of conclusion, I would like to elaborate briefly on some of the ways in which Rosenzweig's theological, aesthetic, and political 67. Stern 270/ Star 243. 68. Stern 271/ Star 243. 69. Stern 272/ Star 244.</page><page sequence="23">Leora Batnitzky 109 views converge in his understanding of the uncanny. As we have seen throughout this essay, Rosenzweig draws on a number of shared cul- tural assumptions about the uncanny in constructing his aesthetic the- ory and view of Jewish Unheimlichkeit. Boyarin contends that the ambivalence about Judaism and Jewishness implicit in Freud's under- standing of the uncanny is paradigmatic of Freud's desire to "remain Jewish while abandoning Judaism."'7 If we accept Boyarin's analysis of Freud, we can see that Rosenzweig, like Freud, links the uncanny with what the anti-Semite sees when he sees the Jew. However, it is pre- cisely the option of remaining Jewish while abandoning Judaism that Rosenzweig seeks to reject with his notion of the uncanny. In fact, Rosenzweig's thought suggests that an embrace of Jewish uncanniness marks a return to Judaism and Jewish difference. In keeping with the Star's valorization of images, Rosenzweig rejected what he considered the apologetic stance of liberal German Jews who, he argued, from Mendelssohn forward, sought to equate Judaism with Germanism. Rosenzweig argues for a diaspora Jewish community that needs to return to a self-contained world of its own, though its individual members may participate fully in German culture. Rosenzweig's conception of the uncanny converges with his ethical monotheistic framework: he maintains that only by returning to Juda- ism can Jews achieve a difference that could create the vitality neces- sary for the production of Jewish uncanniness. Rosenzweig argues that Jews are wrenched from their home (are made un-heimlich), for the sake of world redemption. In order to serve their world historical mission, Rosenzweig main- tains that Jews must invent anew a separate and self-contained Jewish community. To restore, albeit in new form, the wholeness or the inner inseparableness of Jewish existence became the sole aim of Rosenz- weig's program for Jewish education in Germany. In a comment from an outline for a series of lectures at the Lehrhaus presented from Janu- ary through March 1921, we see clearly the connection between Rosen- zweig's aesthetic theory and program for Jewish education: Do you perceive what we lost when our grandparents turned their back on the beautiful life, and turned toward a life in which beauty is but an island (l'art pour l'art), an isolated phenomena, an idol? Do you per- ceive what we have to gain, and how we have to be regained? A life 70. Unheroic Conduct 224.</page><page sequence="24">110 Rosenzweig's Aesthetic Theory that is wholly artwork [ganz Kunstwerk], wholly beauty, because it is wholly life, wholly our life.71 Rosenzweig argues that if Jews are to (re)create a Jewish world for themselves, they must understand that a return to their holy language is absolutely essential to the task. A Jewish world is centered on Hebrew, which is the language of Judaism, both figuratively and literally.72 For Rosenzweig, an acquaintance and then intimacy with Hebrew is the only path to Jewish Ganzheit: The German, and even the Jew qua German, can and will read the Bible as Luther, Herder, or Moses Mendelssohn read it; the Jew can understand it only in Hebrew. And even though in the case of the Bible both possibilities must be admitted, because both Jew and Ger- man share in its possession, the language of Jewish prayer is different; of the language of Hebrew prayer we may state quite categorically: it cannot be translated. Therefore the transmission of literary documents will never suffice; the classroom must remain the ante-room leading to the synagogue and to participation in its service. And understanding of public worship and participation in its expression will make possible what is necessary for the continuation of Judaism: a Jewish world.73 The recreation of a Jewish world is not for Rosenzweig a nationalist or Zionist task, but a distinctly diaspora one. The Jew, according to Rosenzweig, "never lose[s] the untrammeled freedom of a wanderer who is more faithful a knight to his country when he roams abroad, craving adventure and yearning for the home [Heimat] he has left behind, than when he is at home [zuhause]."74 Rosenzweig's call for a 71.

As he wrote to his parents in October of 1916 regarding the Rabbinical Assem- bly's debate on Jewish education: "The attitude toward Hebrew is the sore point, far more than the debate itself brought out. For Hebrew must be pursued not as the subject of study, but as the very medium through which the entire content of [Judaism] is presented" [Brief und Tagebiicher vol. 1 (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1979) 257]. 73.

For Rosenzweig, the attempt to revitalize Hebrew within the host culture is an attempt to return to Jewish Unheimlichkeit. The aesthetic, political, and theological dimensions of this attempt are reflected per- haps most acutely in Buber and Rosenzweig's translation of the Hebrew Bible into German. In what was in fact intended as a criticism of the Buber-Rosenzweig translation of the Bible, Gershom Scholem captures precisely the effect that Buber and Rosenzweig hoped to achieve: What fills me with doubt is the excessive tonality of this prose, which leaps out almost uncannily [fast unheimlich] from the particular word- ing (this word is wrong; I mean the niggun [melody] of your transla- tion). If the narratives of Genesis fairly burst with pent-up-pathos (and sometimes actually do so), I dare not think of the nggun that pro- phetic speech will have to assume in your translation.75 Scholem's comment reflects the intended sense of strangeness and foreignness that Buber and Rosenzweig aimed to produce in their trans- lation. It is for this reason that Rosenzweig describes the translation project as a particularly diaspora one, as Rosenzweig responded to Buber's announcement that he intended to emigrate to Palestine: Even if you read German in Jerusalem and read about the book in question, you will lack there the real motivating sense of mission for such a specific galut [diaspora] project. ... even though in the firm of Buber and Rosenzweig your investment of working capital amounts to eighty percent and mine to only twenty, the goal and effectiveness of the work are determined by the goal and work contributed by me, the galut Jew.76 In this connection, Rosenzweig might respond to Scholem's criticism of the translation that the "pent-up-pathos" to which Scholem refers is pre- cisely the uncanny effect of diaspora, Jewish existence. Though Scholem would come to appreciate Rosenzweig's perspective on the problem of making the Hebrew language profane, he could never 75. Gershom Scholem to Buber, 27 Apr. 1926, emphasis added.

The return to the Jewish uncanny is for Rosenzweig, contra Freud, a return to a Jewishness with Judaism. The separate wholeness of Jewish exist- ence literally embodies for Rosenzweig the secret of God's revelation. Rosenzweig argues that only by existing without a home can Jews give the nations of the world the opportunity to respond to this secret revealed. The pent-up-pathos produced by Jewish uncanniness may pro- duce a vicious anti-Semitism, but Rosenzweig argues, in keeping with the ethically monotheistic framework of his mentor, Hermann Cohen, this is part and parcel of the Jewish mission to the nations. 77.
