<plain_text><page sequence="1">VI.-NEW BOOKS. [These Notes (by various hanids) do vot excltde Critical Notices later on.] A Dictionary of Philosophy in the Words of Philosophers. Edited with an Introduction by J. RADFORD THOMSON, M.A., Professor of Philosophy in New College, London, anid in Hackney College. London: R. D. Dickinson, 1887. Pp. xlviii., 479. This Dictionary has been based on a collection of passages from philoso- phical writers made by " a collator of experience". The editor's part has been to excise on the one hand and extend on the other, with the view of holding the balance even amnong the different schools or the different topics. In particular, it appears to be due to the editor that a fair repre. sentation has been given of the later scielntific psychology as well as of the recent Kalntian nlovement in English philosophy. To him also is due the present arrangement of the whole mass of extracts-according to principles which, if nowhere explicitly stated, are mnore or less implied in an Intro- duction that deals successively with the definition, divisions and origin of philosophy, its history in general and its present state in this country. The arrangement is topical throughout, without other alphabetical clue than is supplied by two concluding ilndexes, of names and of subjects. The index of namnes is, in its way, pretty complete; not so the other. This is far too little detailed to be of real service, especially as no table of contents in their actual order is anywhere set out. The Dictionary, in point of fact, affords a good deal more information than the index of subjects gives any notion of: for example, Leibniz's important distinction of symbolical and in- tuitive knowledgeisnotomitted,but is farfrom havingitspresence sufficiently suggested by " Knowledge, Application of," even when the index of names adds " Leibniz, Knowledge ". The absence of a table of contelnts, setting out the main topics in order of treatment and the steps of the treatment in order, "is to be regretted in the interest of the student, more than in the interest of the reviewer. The reviewer can, at a certain cost of time, turn over the pages and discover that there are twenty-four main topics in all; that the first two are general or introductory (" Designations, &amp;c.," " Mind"); and that the remaining twenty-two are grouped under three heads of "Psychology and Philosophy "-(A.) "of Cognlition," (B.) "'of Feeling," (C.) "of the Will "--and one of (D.) "Moral Philosophy or Ethics ". The last (?? 19-24) includes as final main topic " The Immor- tality of Man ". Under "Cognition" (?? 3-13) the inost noticeable feature is that the three closing sections (pp. 223-91) are taken up with an attempt to characteri'se the chief philosophical thinkers or schools-ancient, medize- val and mllodern-by extracts almost entirely drawn from books written about tllemn. Regarding the Dictionary in general, it is not to be denied that good and intelligent use has been made of the material collected, perhaps as good use as was at all possible; nor should the editor's manifest effort to give fair and ftull representation of views with which his Intro- duction shows him to have least synmpathy, remain unacknowledged. It -is the original collector's work that, as far as its quality may be judged from the evidently extensive reirmains of it, lies most open to criticism. Confining himself (as the editor does too) for the most part to modern books in Englislh (original or translated); the collector seems, first of all, to have been excessively liberal in his allowance of philosophical character to particular works, and then, anong works to which that character might</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS. 611 not unfairlv be accorded, to have been prone to nmake chief use of some that can hardly.be called the most important or even, for effective and condensed statement, the most transcript&lt;able. The consequence is that, after all editorial' pruning, there are mnany pages (easily to be remarked) that are by no means wisely filledc; while from others much is found missilng that slhouild have been freely supplied. Take, in the way of omission, the single example of " Unconscious mental action," disposed of, p. 46, in two extracts fromn Caipenter's Mental Physiology andl a few lines from Mill's Hamilton, followed as to " Subconsciousness " by another extract from Mill (not. containin(r the word) and one from Sully's Psychology: not a word from the longc iscussion in haiiilton's Metaphysics noi the slightest men- tion of Leibniz's ' obscure perceptions' ! Buit it seems ungracious to dwell fturther on shortcomnias, wlien to have carried througal the work at all, even within the narrow and artificial limnits set, means no light amount of protracted ancd anlxious labotur. Tliougli, neither in conception nor in executioin, is this the Dictionary of Plhilosophy that one could desire for the iise of English students, it brincs together a inultitude of passages fronm philo- sophical writers that cannot be read without great and varied interest and disposes them in a form that would-if suppTemented by a fuilly detailed index of subjects-be found serviceable for some purposes of reference even by the most advanced. Romantic Love and Pe-sonal Beauty, Their Development, Causal Relations, Historic, and National Peculiacrities. By HENRY T. FINCK. 2 Vols. London and New York: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1887. Pp. x., 424; viii.', 468. These fascinating volunmes are, as the title indicates, first of all an historical and comparative " monog raph " on the sentiment of " Romantic -or pre-matrinionial-Love," which, in the auithor's view, " is a modern sentiment, less than a thousalnd vears old ". "Not till Dante's Vita NuovCt appeared was the gospel of modern Love-the romantic adoration of a maiden by a youth-revealed for the first timne in definite language." "And even Danite was not entirely modern in his Love." " He becamie quite deaf t;o the fuindamental tone of love, and heard only its overtones. And herein lies his inferiority to Shakespeare," for whomn it remained " to combine the idealism with the realism of Love in proper proportions". "Shakespeare's Love is Modern Love." Within the ast two centuries the poets and novelists have caused love to assume gradually "among all educated people characteristics which formerly it possessed oiily in the .minds of a few isolated men of genius ". The art of Courtship that springs out of Romantic Love " is the latest of the fine arts, which even now exists in its perfection in two countries only-England and America"; for Romantic Love dePends " on the freedom anid t&amp;e intellectual and aesthetic culture of wonman ; and in other civilised nations there is mniore or less complete suppression of one or both of these conditionis. Although in de- velopilng his historical thesis the author is sometiines perhaps " too swveeping" (as he himself remarks of a criticisnm of Sc iller on the Minnesingers), this thesis is one to which no one can refuse a hearing who does not deny altogether that there is any historical evolution of enmotions. And occasional exaggeratiolns, such as what is said of " the absolute silence of Greek literature on the suibject of preniatrimnonial infatuation" (i. 122) are corrected by the general exposition. According to the author's view in its full development, there are in antiquity the beginnings, but only the beginnings, of Romantic Love. In the early Middle Agres, these disappear ed under the asceticism of Church Fatlhers and the general barbarism of the *period. Renewed by chivalry, andl above all by the German Folk-songs,</page><page sequence="3">612 NEW BOOKS. they were at length combined by Dante and Shakespeare into the modern sentiinent, with all its distinctive characters or "overtones". Of these there are in all eleven (i. 48-52) ; the last enumerated being " Admiration of Personal Beauty ". This " cesthetic overtone of Love," which " is com- monly heard before and above all the others," tends more and more to be- come of " preponderating importance ". Modern Love depends especially on the charm of individual expression, to which the Greeks were indifferent, and this in turn on intellectual cultivation. The modern development of Romantic Love mav be compared with the modern development of the art of Music; "the individualisation of Beauty and character" being coin- parable to the discovery of harmony (ii. 137-8). All this is developed with a liveliness of style and an abunidance of interesting observations of which it is impossible to give ani idea in a summary. Most of the qualifications and distinctions that a critic could suggest find their proper place in the volumes. But Mr. Finck does more than develop the evolutionary theory that his title promises. The special interest of the book is in its seeking rational grounds for freedom of matrimonial choice. Regarding everything from the point of view of the race, the author rejects at once the French system of " marriages of reason " and (implicitly) the proposals of those ancient theorists and modern anthropologists who have thought that choice should be based on other reasons thani personal preference, and decides for the "Anglo-American " system. To get atihis conclusion, he starts from a discussion of SchopenhauLer's theory; and his own theory is in reality Schopenhauer's without the pessimism, and with scientific verification. "'Apart frolmi the suggestive details of his cssay," Mr. Finck says, "Schopenhauer's merit and originality lie, first, in his having pointed out that Love becomes moie intense the more it is individualised; secondly, in emphasising the fact that in match-making it is not the happiness of the to-be-married couple that should chiefly be consulted, but the consequences of their union to the offspring; thirdly, in dwelling on the important truth that Love is a cause of Beauty, because its aim always is either to perpetuate existing, Beauty through hereditary transmission, or to create new beauty by fusing two imperfect individuals ilnto a being in whomn their shortconiings mutually neutralise one another " (ii. 73). Romantic Love, with its free choice, the preponderance in it of the oesthetic element, and its individualisation, thLis promotes the interests of the race in the bighest degree. And " Anglo-American Love is Romantic Love, pure and simple, as first depicted by Shakespeare, and after him, with more or less accuracy, by a hundred other poets and novelists " (ii. 37). " Love is the cause of Beauty, as Beauty is the cause of Love; " but it is only one cause. "Personal Beauty has four sources "-Health, Mixture of Nationalities, Roinantic Love aild Mental Refinement. When the relations of all these are considered, it is seen yet more clearlv in what way all the initerests of the race are inseparably associated with Romantic Love. Psychology. The Motive Powers. Emotions, Conscience, Will. By JAMES M'COSH, D.D., &amp;c., President of Princeton College. London: Mac- millan &amp; Co., 1887. Pp. vi., 267. This is the promised sequel to the author's Cognitive Powers, noticed in MIND xi. 586. While admiitting the importance of the modern threefold division of the mental powers, Dr. M'Cosh insists that " it is of mornent to keep up the old twofold division as being the deepest, as having run through the ages, andl as being embodied in our habitual thoughts and in common literature". The modern distinction, he thinks, "leaves out the moral power or conscience, which is entitled to have a separate place as one of the characteristics of man, specially distinguishing him from the</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS. 6i13 lower animals "'. The twofold division, as he points out, corresponds toc Aristotle's distinction of the "1 Gnostic " and the " Orective" powers; and, throughout, he seeks an Aristotelian basis for his psychological positions. " The motive powers" are divided into " the emotions, the conscience and the will ". The work, accordingly, falls, after a short introduction, into, three parts: " The Emotions " (pp. 7-192), " The Conscience" (pp. 195-227), " The Will, or Optative Power' (pp. 231-267). The section on the Emo- tions is divided into two books of approximately equal lengtlh, entitled "The Four Elements or Aspects of Emotion" and "Classification and Description of the Emotions '. This part is largely an abridgment of the author's work on The Emotions (noticed in MIND V. -290). An outline of its leading positions will be found in the notice just referred to, and in a Note by the author in MIND ii. 413-15. As regards Conscience, Dr. M'Cosh's position is that " bv the moral sense we know more than we do by .the senses, inner or outer " (p. 196). " The Conscience is not merely co-ordinate with the other powers: it is above them as an arbiter and a judge. . . . In fact, it is the Practical Reason " (pp. 209-10). The moral power " is in all men native and necessary; but it is a norm requiring to be evolved". The facts of its historical development "may be admitted, while we hold that the moral power could not have been produced without a native moral norm any more than a plant or animal could have been produced without a germ". That wlhich, in intelligent' beings, is com- mended by the conscience, is "love ruled by law" (p. 227). Will is some- thing different from an exercise of the understanding, of conscience or. of the emotions. Moral good and evil consist essentialiy not in emotion nor in the possession of a conscience, any more than in the mere external action, but in " an act of will ". Responsibility is coextensive with will. In the discussion of the place of voluntary preference in virtue, of the relations of habit and responsibility, and of the characters of virtue and vice, the author's dependence on Aristotle is especially. evident. The will, he contends, " has freedom," because it is not " determined by motives," if by motives be meant " powers out of the will acting independently of it " (p. 259). The influence of will in mental acts that are not classed as volitional is pointed out without exaggeration. The "main Secondary Law" of Association is found to be "that those ideas come up most frequently on which we have bestowed the largest amount -of force of mind, and this maybe intellect, feeling or will" (pp. 243-4). "The energy bestowed on an idea" " commonly takes the forni of Attention," which is' an act of will. Altogether, the work has the merits of the author's pre- vious work on The Emotions. The section on Will especially is full of sound psychological distinctions and observations. The Game of Logic. By LEwis CARROLL. London: Macmillan-&amp; Co., 1887. Pp. 96. In this pretty little volume, the author of Alice in Wonderland, without surrendering his old playful purpose, tries to 'give youthful readers, s6oie general notion of logical processes. The design is worthy of all'praise : for: nothing should be easier, if teachers were knowing enough, than to convey with the first lessons in grammar a great deal of useful logical doctrine ; and children might have much amusement of a cheap kind in watching the logical practice of their elders, even if not set to regular 'games with propositions and arguments. It is not so' clear that the author has taken the best way for working out his purpose. He has a new mode of graphi- cally representing propositions (by-full or' empty compartments within a square), which is sufficiently ingenious, but which seems to put rather heavy shackles upon the juvenile reasoner. exposed -to the common speech</page><page sequence="5">614 NEW BOOKS. of human kind. When the universal affirmation, "All 'new cakes are nice," cannot be understood and worked with except as made up of the twvo propositions, " Sonme new cakes are nice " and " No new cakes are not nice," one begins to doubt whether the author has not been a little more con- cerned to be inventive than either edifying or amusing. And if the instructioii might be simpler and more effective, the interpolated humour also might be more happy:, at least it is not easy to imagine that the boy or maiden who can follow the auithor's rather technical exposition will be tickled by qtuips that appear suited for only very young children. But whether the author succeeds or not with his, proposed aim, this scheme of graphic representation is by no means undeserving of attention by the side of the others that have been devised of late years. Like some other of the innovators, he can do scant justice to the traditional systenm, as at p. 35, wvhere the mare's nest of the two negative premisses is again discovered, with an air of importance almost as grave as Jevons displayed on the occasion. Studies and Exercises in Formal Logic, including a Generalisation of Logical Processes in their Application to Complex Inferences. By JOHN NEVILLE KEYNES, M.A., University Lectuirer in Moral Science, Cambridge. Second Edition revised and enlarged. London: Macmillan, 1887. Pp. xii., 455. The usefulness predicted for these Studies when reviewed in MIND ix. 301 is proved by the call already for a second edition. The whole book has been carefully revised, and considerable parts of it have been rewritten, with the result of enlargement by about 30 pp. It is a distinct improve- ment that the unanswered exercises are. now separated out from the expository matter, and placed at the end of the chapters; also that an index has been added. In its new form, the book will be still miore helpful to students than before. A Treatise on the Principle of Sufficient Reason. A Psychological Theory of Reasoning, showing the Relativity of Thought to the Thinker, of Recognition to Cognition, the Identity of Presentation and Represen- tation, of Perception and Apperception. By Mrs. P. F. FITZGERALD. London: Thomas Laurie, 1887. Pp. xvi., 410. The philosophical purpose of this book is described in the sub-title. The " two doctrines " that constitute its foundations are-" first, the existence of God, who from His very nature is, and must be, good, because He is the Source and Giver of all good, and Ordainer of the moral law; and secondly, that of the necessity of th6 divinely-ordained counterpartal union of every human soul with its complementary bpirit ". In other words, " love, human: and divine, is the secret of happiness-the true Best for Being" (p. 3), "The complete idea or mental representation of Being, which constitutes intelligence, vovs, the Gnosis, the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world," is "present in each individual man through his faculty of reflecting on the presentations of his own inner Being, and tlhrough the logical principle of what is experienced in being, generalising through comparison of less and greater, until he arrives at the idea of perfect, absolute Being " (p. 243). What is notable in the author's development of this form of mysticism is the insistence on permanent distinctions of personality. The individuality is not to be suppressed, but " self-preservation " is " the first law alike of the animal and the spiritual life" (p. 228). "If we choose to sacrifice our life for love, it is still because it is our own joy so to do. Feeling is not to be extinguished for the good for Being, as the Bouddha Sakbya Mouni taught; for as the blood is the</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS. 615 life of the beast, so is love the life of the spirit. Being is to be cleveloped by an(d through natural, designed relativity; througth the harmllonious nnion and comlmntuliion of spirits with each other, andl with the Father of Spirits-this is the true unitv of Being, the truie service of God." In spite of what the author calls its " not very orderly elaboration," there is much in the book that is philosophically suggestive. It is illustrated by the results of m-ultifarious reading, especially among the philosophers and poets. Th-e Cosmology of the Rigveda. An Essay. By' H. W. WALLIS, M.A., Gonville and Caitus College, Cambridge. Published by the Hibbert Trustees.' London: Williamns &amp; Norgate, 1887. Pp. xii., 130. "The. object of this essay," the author says, 'is not so much to present a complete picture of the cosmology of the Rigveda, as to supply the material from which stich a picture may be drawn. The writer has endeavoured to leave no strictly cosmological passage without a reference, ancl to add references to illuistrative passages when they appeared, to indicate the direction in which an explanation may be sotught." The result is a verv full account. of the imagery by which the Rishis represented the origin of tlhings, under the heads of " The Buildincg of the World," "Generatioll" and "The Sacrifice" (cc. i.-iii., pp. 16-90). The general conclusion inay best be summarised in the author's own .'words : " We have now passed in review the three rrmost circunmstantial explanations of the origin of the world. In the first chapter it was regarded as a work of art;* and since the principal manufacture known to the men of the tiine was the working of wood, the world was pronounced a prooduction of builders and joiners. In' the secoild chapter the origin of the world was ascribed to the agency of that visible process which is the cause of all natural, as opposed to mechanical, production. In the argumnent of this chapter (c. iii.) the origin of the world was supposed to have been effected by a similar instrumentalitv to that which is represented as the most efficacious in the hands of man, the formal sacrifice. The three explana- tions are not mnutually exclusive; any two of them or all three are frequelntly combined together in one verse. The classification adopted in this essay is, therefore, to be regarded as one of practical convenience only. Further, it must not be supposed that what is here described as the system of the Rishis was their exclusive possession. There miiay have been laymen whose views were more sacerdotal than those of the priests ; as there may have been, and doubtless were, priests to whom speculation was dearer than ritual. On the other hand, a classification based oln later forms of thought would have been positively misleading. We mlay very easily persuade ourselves that in some isolated verse we have discovered the starting-point of a later philosophy, where the comiiparison of simiiilar passages shows that it was only the poverty of our imaginationi which confined the meaning within our own particular range of thought. The Rigveda must be made its own commentary. It is a not inifrequent occurrence that a whole complex of modern ideas finds its most happy and appropriate expression in an old term, or a proper name or attribute, or in the words of an ancient saying. The words themnselves have contributed nothing to the formation of the ideas; they had lost their first meaning and were fast falling into oblivion, when the breath of a spirit from another sphere inspired them with a new vitality." The great difference of the speculations of the Veeda from those of the Upanishads and of later philosophy is that the formner are more disinterested; represeniting the origin of the world in analogy with the known modes of the production of things, but with no thought of purpose. The three chapters above referred to are preceded by an introduction on the distinguishing charac.</page><page sequence="7">616 NEW BOOKS. teristics of the Rigveda and followed by a chapter on " The Order of the World " as conceived by the Rishis (c. iv., pp. 91-108), and an appendix on " The Cosmography of the Rigveda " (pp. 111-117). [Since these lines were written, a few weeks ago, the death of the voung author has been announced. A life of much promise is thus cut short.] Agnostic Problems, being An Examination of Some Questions of the Deepest Interest, as Viewed from the Agnostic Stancdpoint. By RICHARD BITHELL, B.Sc., Ph.D., Author of The Creed of a Modern Agnostic. London: Williams &amp; Norgate, 1887. Pp. viii., 152. This is a sequel to The Creed of a Modern Agnostic, noticed in MIND viii. 456. Its contents are sufficiently indicated in the sub-title. "The Agnostic standpoint," as defined by the author, is that "that which comes within the sphere of consciousness may be known. . . . But whether the realities which exist outside the sphere of consciousness correspond in any way with the conceptions of which we are conscious, is a question wvhich we have no means whatever of solving." " On the side of the Know- able," the Agnostic "founds and cultivates his Science; on the side of the Unknowable, he finds an illimitable arena for the exercise of Belief and Faith ". The Philosophy of Religion on the Basis of its History. By Dr. OTTO PFLEIDERER. Vol. II., " Schelling to the Present Day," translated by ALLAN MENZIES, B.D. London: Williams &amp; Norgate, 1887. Pp. ix., 316. The present volume, following upon the one noted in MIND xi. 587, completes the historical half of Pfleiderer's work: the "genetico-specula- tive," half remains to be similarly broken up into two volumes. (It was an error in previous notice to speak of the translation as to be in three volumes, artificially divided.) The rendering continues worthy of the ,ubject. Besides a few new sentences on the ZUrich tlheologian Bieder- mann, the author, with English readers in view, has added a paragraph (p. 309) on Prof. H. Drummond's Natural Law 'in the Spiritual World, and gives at pp. 182-6 an estimate of Mr. M. Arnold's contribultions to the theory of religion. He finds Mr. Arnold's conception of a " Not-ourselves " to be not less metaphysical and much vaguer than that for which it is sought to be substituted, and, after referring to his historical interpretation, thus sums up: " Arnold is no doubt a writer of great and many-sided acquire- inents; all that he writes is pleasant to read and full of suggestions: but he possesses no real grip either in philosophy or in history, and if he thinks he can make this want good bv dint of clever and eloquent writing, he is mistaken; nor will it iuend his error to exalt himself, and make his -readers merry at the expense of those who have treated serious problems more seriously than he ". Matter and Energy: Are there two Real Things in the Physical Universe ? Being an Examination of the Fundamental Conceptions of Physical Science. By B. L. L. London: Kegan Paul, Trench, 1887. Pp. 85. This is an attempt to reconcile Science and Idealism by the assumption that the reality postulated by science is not Matter but Energy. Matter is merely phenomenal; bodies are only " elements of our sense-experience," not "independently existent things". "Take an example-a stone for instance. Do you, the reader asks, revert to Idealism, and say it ceases to exist when you cease to experience it? We reply that the phenomenon we call a stone, which belongs to the class we call bodies, does so cease; but that there continues to exist its external cause, which, however, is</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS. 617 nothing more than certain forms of so mnuch Energy transforming itself in certain ways." "Energy alone is the real thing, of wbich we have no immediate experience, but experience only its resuilts." Space, the primary and secondary qualities of body, and the different chemical kinds of bodies, are all explicable in termns of Enlergy and its transformationls (pp. 69-74). Energy is really indestructible. Matter is "historically indestruc- tible,-real as an event, -but not real as an independently existing entitv " "The conception of material bodies, if freed from the erroneous assumption of independent reality, is a most useful abbreviation-like an algebraical symbol-of what would in terms of Energy alone take much longer to express." " In the grand doctrine of Energy, as a thing not perceived by the senses, but apprehended by the intellect and discovered by the reason alone," Science has " fturnished Philosophy with the long-sought conception of a consistent rational, unsensational, real ' universal "'. Morality and Utility. A Natural Science of Ethics. By GEORGE PAYNE BEST, B.A., M.B., Cantab. London: Trubner &amp; Co., 1887. Pp. vii., 200. This study had its origin in the author's conviction that the Moral Law, having the characters of Absoluteness, Universality anid Permanence, cannot be identical with Utility. The conclusions to which he has been led on from this starting-point are, he says, somewhat differenit from those at which he expected to arrive. For while he arrives at- the distinction between " truth of Utility " and " truth of Morality," corresponding to the clistinction between approval of actions for their useful effects and approval of them for their conformity to the Absolute Right, Morality or Justice of intuitional moralists, he also finds that "truth of Morality" is "not the kind of truth that can be put into practice ". The absolute moral ideal is only applicable in an icleal world, the conditions of which are inconsistent with realitv. Ani absolutely uniform law can only apply to an absolut;ly equal population; and for a population to be absolutely equal, it mnst consist entirely of adult members, all asexual and immortal (p. 77). Btuddhist and Christian Monachism and modern " Social Democracy " are alike attempts to realise parts of the moral ideal (which can only exist as a whole) in the world of facts. The result of the socialistic " attempt to take parts from the ideal world, and mix them with the world of facts," must be "to make the world of facts infinitely worse than it is for every- body ". "The Moral Sense, truly, declares that men are equal. Observa- tion of the world of facts shows that men are altogether unequal." " The existing order of things is not moral, but utile." The explanation of the discrepancy between Morality and Utility is that Morality, like mathe- matical science, feigns a greater uniformity than really exists. " In the case of Mathematics, we are really dealing with our own ideas; and, even when we apply those ideas to the concrete, we apply thenm only to certain abstract elements of that concrete. But with Morality it is otherwise. We are dealing with- the world of men', women and children, in all their con- creteness and difference; but we. are treating them as if they were mere ideas. The upshot is that, though Morality may be true enough for our ideas; or for men and women, if they were, as treated in thought, really equal; as applied to actual men and women, it gives a false result." Absolute Morality, then, is an illusion,-but an illusion that has had good effects, not only in the production of ideal characters, but in the gradcual improvement of things as estimated by the utilitarian test. "Suppress Morality (as tlhe Utilitarians have done), and you have destroyed-at least in theory-the golden bridge by which man passes out of the category of personal considerations to those of a wider sphere. Morality is the decoy 40</page><page sequence="9">618 NEW BOOKS. which leads us to Vir-tue." "Now Virtue, with its correlated Duty -and Obligation, is a part of Utility-it is consistent with Utility: which Morality is not. In Virtue the interests of the individual and of Society are reconciled." Absolute Relativism; or the Absolute in Relation. By WILLIAM, BELL M'TAGGART, late Captain 14th Hussars. Vol. I. London: W. Stewart &amp; Co. Pp. viii., 133. The author's ultimate purpose is a reconciliation of the religious and the scientific philosophy of the day. " The fetiches of the hour are personality and intelligence of the ' All-upholder ' on the one hand, as against 'non- personiality and mechanical necessities of the ultimate substratum '. Both camps seem regardless that the other holds at least one aspect of the truth, and that a higher knowledge and a wider generalisation may unify the two into All-personality and All-theism." His purpose in the present volume-divided into three parts, entitled " Prolegomena " (pp. 1-22), "Materialism" (pp. 25-86) and "Idealism" (pp. 91-133)-is by succes- sively reviewing miaterialistic and idealistic philosophy, as stated by " their accepted representatives," to arrive at the unquestionable truths of eacl system in the form of certain ultimate " axioms ". What remains is to find out how the truths of these and other philosophies limit one another, and how they may yet "exist synchronously within Infinity". The result attained so far is this :-" Having started with the postulate I=I, in the endeavour to ascertain, by the avenues of experience and reason alone, what that Ego was or is, we have lighted upon the certain demon- stration that it is complex instead of simple, and that the postulate, the I, includes the postulate and dem-ionstration of the existence of the Not-I also ". Life of Adamn Smith. By R. B. HALDANE, M.P. (" Great Writers.") London: Walter Scott, 1887. Pp. ix., 161, x. More than half of this volume is devoted to the account and consideration of Smith's work as an economist; Ihis work as a moralist is disposed of in a short chapter (pp. 56-73), following upon a graphic sketch of the life. The author presses the charge of want of system too far against the Theory of Moral Sentiments, whether by itself or in comparison with Hurne's ethical performance. Great as Hume's general philosophical importance is, it caln hardly be said of him as a moralist that it was he " who first made it plain that Metaphysics and Etlhics are inextricably intertwined " (p. 25) ; and if Smith was no metaphysician, it cannot therefore be saicl that he did not take up a position of permanent mark, after or by the side of Hume, in the ethical movement of his century. At p. 65, in reference to Smith's excltu- Sion of "Utilitarian" considerations, it is somewhat loosely remarked that Hume also made light of such when he refused to find "the guiding principle of conduct in the tendency to seek self ". And is Hume's pro- clamation of the principle of Utility well described (p. 66) as a " suggestion tlhrown out " in " somewhat cynical scepticism " ? Proceedings of The Society for Psychical Research.

An important paper by Mrs. H. Sidgwick (in the previous Part) on her experience of spiritualistic mediums is here followed up by an elaborate memoir (pp. 381-495) on " The Possibilities of Mal- Observation and Lapse of Memory from a Practical Point of View," the joint-work of Mr. R. Hodgson and Mr. S. J. Davey. Mr. Hodgson (who exploded the Blavatsky imposture) writes a general " Introduction " to the "Experimental Investigation" which he helped Mr. Davey to conduct; Mr. Davey being a man of first-rate conjuring powers, who has been able to equal (if not surpass) all that has been achieved by professional " mediuins " in the way of slate-writing. Never pretending with his sitters to aiiy supernatural powers, and even putting them on their guard against trickerv, Mr. Davey has yet been readily credited with thaumaturgic attributes, andl the ilnvestigation consists mainly in a critical comparison of the written reports ftirnishe(d bv the sitters, of what they saw, fancied thev saw or failed to see. Nothing could be more instructive than the evidence thus obtained of the fallibility of human observation and memory, especially under the sway of emotion ; the different emotional moods of the various sitters-according as they knew nothing, little or much of the actual conditions under which the phenomiiena were produced--giving to the reports the liveliest diversity of hue. Beside other papers of psychological interest, the Part contains two important researches by Mr. E. Gurnev. One on "Stages of Hypnotic Memory" (pp. 5]5-31) adds most strikiing, evidence to what he before adduced in MIND ix. 110 if., x. 161 ff., as to the discontinuity of memory between different stages of the hypnotic trance and its continuity between recurrences of the same stage,-within limits, however, that are now for the first time approximately defined. The other memoir on " Peculiarities of certain Post-hiypnotic States " (pp. 268-323) is still more remarkable for the light it throws, by a protracted series of experiments (some, with planchette, of a quite novel description), upon those most puzzlingr manifestations of " secondary intelligence " that are dis- closed in the performance, more or less unconsciously, within the waking state of orders given in the hypnotic trance. In both memoirs the writer touches, witlh a skilful hand, on the philosophical implication of the facts, as bearing on the question of personal identity. Essai de Psychologie Gfne'rale. Par CHARLES RICHET, Agrege a la Faculte de Mddecine de Paris. Avec figures dans le texte. Paris: F. Alcan, 1887. Pp. xiv., 193. "General psychology," in the author's conception, is a synthesis of psychological facts, viewed in their general aspects, from the knowledge of their ultimate elements made possible by physiolog,y, of wlhich psychology is simply " the obscurest chapter ". A notion of his procedure is given by the orrder of treatment he adopts, wlhich is as follows :-(1) "Irritability," (2) " The Nervous System," (3) " Reflex Movement," (4) "Instinct," (5) "Consciousness," (6) "Sensation," (7) "Memory," (8) "The Idea," (9) " The Will ". " Cellular irritability," which includes both " sensibility" and " motor reaction," may be regarded as "6 elementary psychical life ". It manifests itself under the three forms of " reflex action," " instinct " and "intelligence ". The characters alike of reflex action and of instinct are "fatality and finality ". That is to say, they take place for the advantage of the organism or the species, but without consciousness of their end. All the distinictions of instinct from reflex action depend on its greater com- plexity. "Instinct, or at least complicated instinct, supposes unintelli- gence, just as intelligence supposes the absence of instinct." Man has</page><page sequence="11">620 NEW BOOKS. reflex actions and intelligence, but no instincts properly so-called. Con- sciousness is "1 a phenomenon superadded to movement and independent of it," and modifving neither the external excitation nor the reaction of the organism. The a"uthor recognises the difficulty of admiitting " unecnscious sensibility" ancl "unconscious sensations," but uses the terms with a proviso against misunderstanding. " Sensation with consciousness," in his definition, is "perception"; "perception with attention" is " appercep- tion ". Animals, down to "the imiddle of tlle zoological scale," probablv have consciousness, " at least vagLue and confused " ; but there is no profit in observations on any but tbe human consciousness. In nman there is consciousness of " smsation " and consciousness of "motility," to which a still more important elemelnt is to be added, viz., miemorv, which miay be said to create consciousness and the unity of the Ego. Consciousness, inl ultimate analysis, is " a succession of states of consciousness with recollec- tion ". "Sensation is a physiological phenomenon, and perception is a psychological phenomenon." The laws of sensation agree (perhaps not exactly) with the laws of muscular irritability. Hence study of the laws of muscular contraction is the best introduction to pbysiological psycho- logy. " Emotions " are " sensitive inistincts (as distilnguished fronm " motor instincts ") with consciousness ". The will is essentially a "f orce of in- hibition," which niay be exercised either by an " idea " or a " reflex " in a struggle against others. When the struggle between ideas is not on too unequal terms, we have the illusion of free-will. " Attention," " the best- defined form of wvill," is " an apparatus of excitability that reinforces images ". Finally, " intelligence' is " an explosive mechanism with con- sciousness and memory"; for the essential character of organiisms, that becomes imore and more manifest as we ascend the zoological scale, is the power, which explosive substances also possess, of setting free large amounts of energy in response to a slight initial ehange ; and this character is most of all manifest in the phenomena of intelligence, these being organicallv the highest. L'ancienne et la nouvelle Philosophie. Essai stur les Lois g6ndrales dui De- veloppement de la Philosophie. Par E. DE ROBERTY. Paris: F. Alcan, 1887. Pp. vi., 364. This volumte is the first part of a work which, as projected by the author, will consist of six similar parts. His systeni may be described as a niocli- fied Positivism. The object of his first volumwe is to study the philosophy of the past and present as " a social fact," necessary in a certain staae of evolution, but destined to give place to the synthesis of the sciences which is to be the philosophy of the future. He accepts Comte's law of the three states, but only as an enmpirical forilmLla deducible from more fundamental laws, viz., " the law of the three types of metaphysics " aiid " the law of correlation- between science anid philosophy ". Theology and metaphysics alike are hypothetical tbeories of the universe constructed in the absence of a sufficient basis of positive science ; theology being essentially all infe- rior and popularised forrn of philosophy, existing in general side by side with metaphysics. Metaphysical hypotheses are of three types-Material- istic, Idealistic and Sensualistic. Every metaphysical hypothesis is an attempt to explain the universe in terms of the phenomena that form the subject-mnatter of one particular group of sciences. Thus the nmaterialist ex- plains all phenomena by reference to the laws of inorganic nature, while the idealist explains them all by reference to the higher psychical and social phenomena. These two forms of metaphysics are contenmporaneous in origin and continue to exist side by side. Materialism is a kind of preniiature positivism. Idealisin has the characters of a reaction and tends to attach</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS. 621 itself to theology. Sensualistic philosophy is chronologically later than the two others. It has the same relation to the biological sciences that the other forms of metaphysics have respectivelv to the sciences of iliorganic natture and to the social sciences. Thotugh solmietimes brought into alliance with nmaterialism (as by Hobbes and by the French Sensationalists of the 18th century) and sometimes with idealism (as by Berkeley), it is essen- tially a distinct type of metaphysics, having for the uiltimate terms of its olitology " sensations "-that is, those psychical phenomena of which the biological conditions are first discovered--and the " representations" that result from them. What determines the character asstumed by-each meta- physical doctrine in every age is the state of the positive sciences in that age. This is the " law of correlation between science and philosophy". In general no affiliation of philosophies to one another is to be attempted. They depend, not on the previotus state of philosophy, but on contemporary social conditions; the dominant condition being the state of the positive sciences. The " metaphysical stage " of philosophy is characterised by its "false independence " of the sciences. The positive sciences, on the other hand, are uninfluenced, or only influenced to their injury, by metaphysical doctrines. Each positive science depends for its development on the ante- cedent sciences, as philosophy depends on them all. The scientific philo- sophy of the future will resemble the philosophies of the past in being a "conlception of the universe ". Its difference from them will consist in this, that it will not be hypotlietical,-hypotheses having their place in special science where they can be verified, not in philosophy where they are assumed sirnply because knowledge has not yet become scientific,-but will be a synthesis of all the general restults of the sciences, including the as yet rudimentary group of the psychical and social sciences. Positivism may be regarded as its " anticipation ". Essai sur le Libre Arbitre, sa Thuforie et son Histoire. Par GEORGE L. FONSE- GRIVE, Professeur agr6gd de Philosophie au Lycee de Bordeauix. Ouvrage couronne par l'Acade'mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques. Paris: F. Alcan, 1887. Pp. 592. This is a history of the- question of free-will, followed by a theory, founded on historical criticism, of the relations of freedom and necessity. The history is treated in three books, dealing respectively with " Pagan Thought," "Christian Theology" and "Modern Philosophy ". The theore- tical part, which is rather shorter than the historical part, is again divided into three books,-entitled "Criticism," "The Thesis" and "The Conse- quences ". The historical account of doctrines is extremely good and im- partial, and is full of interest of detail. The same may be said of the criti- cal part. The theological doctrines in particular, in which the author has taken speeial interest, are treated in suchl a way as to bring out exactly their philosophical beariing. All that can be attempted here is to give a suimmary of the auithor's positive resuilts. The opposition of necessity and freedom, in the shape finally given to it by pagan philosophy, he finds to be "How can the free-will of man be reconciled with the order esta- blished by Providence? " This formn of the opposition had onlly been arrived at after a long development from tlle doctrine of an absolute fate or necessity, which was common to primitive Greek religion and to early philosophy. The place of freedom in tlle world was first clearly marked out by Aristotle, who recognised the element of contingency in that which depelnds on man,-r7 e' iVp'kv: affirming that man is irresistibly attracted towards the good, but allowing him at the same time the power of choosing freely among the means to good. Opposite positions still continued to be taken; but, as the result of the development from Socrates, the "n necessity"</page><page sequence="13">622 NEW BOOKS. of the determinist schools was no longer a material necessity but a rational order. Christianity was on the whole more favourable than paganism to the doctrine of free-will. This is explained partly by its relation to the Jewish law, which, being imperative, supposes the power of choice in man; partly by the character of the Christian doctrine of providence, its substi- tution of "love" for "pure reason" as the doniniant conception. There are in all, it is concluided, five possible positions; and, historically, all these have been held. First there are "the thesis" and " the antithesis," tlie doctrines of " absolute determinism" (held by the Stoics, Luther and Cal- vin, &amp;c.) and of "absolute indeterininism " (held by the Epicurealis, Pela- gius, &amp;c.). Then there is the denial of the possibility of a synthesis. This is the. position of some modern men of science, stuch as DPu Bois-Reymond, as well as of some Catholic doctors, sulch as Bossuet, who insists that we must keep hold of " both ends of the chain "-human freedom and divine necessity-witlhout any attempt to join them. Fourth, there is the " nega- tive synthesis " of the Elnglish empirical school, represented by Hume and Mill, who try to get ridl of the iiotions both of free-will and necessity, substituting that of invariable sequeence within the limits of observation, and applying it to material and nmental phenomena alike. Lastly, there is "Cthe tre synthesis," which consists in the denial (permitted by logic) of the two colitraries of absolute determinism and absolute indeterminism, to- gether witlh the affirmation of the " subalterniate" propositions, "Something is necessary," " Something is free ". The author's method of arriving at this synthesis is first to show, by a criticism of the doctrine of " absolute necessity," that it canlot be proved either on grounds of physical science, of psychology or of metaphysics ; then to trace it to its origin in a certain " logical vice "-the tendency of the min(d to suppress variety in the search for unity; and then to show, on the other side, that the doctrine of " abso- lute indeterminism " has its origin in the same logical vice as the doctrine of absolute determinism. The refutation of both these doctrines leaves the affirmation of a limited freedom as the only one logically possible. Free- will, thus shown to be open to no logical objection, is to be affirmed on moral grounds. It is definable as " the power in virtue of which man can choose between two contrary actions without being determined by any necessity"; and the notion of "imprevisibility" is to be asserted, witholut qualification, as a part of its meaning. The author admits that it is incon- sistent with the acceptance of the conservation of energy as " an absolute law, without restriction ". In reality, however, this, like all scientific laws, is only " a relative, experimental law," not " absolutely exact," but " nearly and sensibly certain ". "It is with a leaden, not with an iron, rule that the plan of things has been traced ". In some decisions of the will there is a real indetermination of inotives, and the predonminance is given to one side by an act of free-will, which m-ust be assumied to proceed from the imniaterial soul and to introduce a new force into the world (or to destroy an existing force). Spiritualism, therefore, is tlle only metaphysical doc- trine consistent with the admission of free-will. The decision is made by free-will when there is a conflict between the ideas of " sensible " and' " in- telligible" or "universal" good; the idea of "universal good" being formed by " the activity of reason," without material orgall. The mode of operation of free-will is, by-suppressing the inhibition of one motor tendency, to set another tendency free, In his last book, tlle author contends tllat the ethical, political and oesthetic consequences of the doctrine of free-will are preferable to those of determinism. It is more favourable, in particu- lar, to tlhe adnmission of inviolable personal rights. " La seule difference, mais elle est capitale, qui se trouve dans les cons4qunences sociales qu'on peut logiquement deduire dii deterniinisme et du libre arbitre, c'est que, seule, la croyance-au libre arbitre et a la valeur morale que le monde</page><page sequence="14">NEW BOOKS. 623 acquiert par lui, permet d'opposer a la loi civile une barriere juridique au seuil de chaque conscience individuelle " (p. 553). This seems a little in- consistent with what is said earlier (with special reference to the free-will doctrines of Catholicism and the necessitarianism of the Reformers) :-"La n6cessit6 d'une autorite est la consequence de la croyance au libre arbitre ; la suppression de l'autoritt exterieure entraine comme contre-coup, pour eviter l'anarchie qui menace, la destruction de la croyance au libre arbitre" (p. 132). U. VAN ENDE. Histoire Natur elle de la Croyance. Premiere Partie. L'Aninial. Paris: F. Alcan, 1887. Pp. xi., 320. This is the first part of a projected work on the origin of miiythology and the religious sentiment. Its purpose. is to show that "animism "-by which is meant the conception of all things, without distinction of living and not-living, as animated-is " the complex and secondary product of a period already speculative ". Man has no primitive impulse to " vitalise " nature. It is in states of consciousness older than animism that religion has its origin. "The animnist doctrine "-that is, the doctrine that regards " ainimism " as the earliest belief of men about natural things-" gives no account of the affective element, which is the true substance of religions, from the simplest beliefs to the most abstract worships ". Aniinism is not the source of the different cturrents of religious thought, but is their collec- tive result. What may be inferred from observation of children, who do rnot really confuse the not-living with the living, and of savages, who regard some natural objects as alive but not all, is confirmed by study of the minds of animals. The intellectual currents that have becolmle the source of mvthology, as of all human beliefs, " exist already in animality ". "The myths of primnitive nian are onlv a more advanced and more precise formi of their development." Accordingly, the bulk of the present volume is a study of animal psychology, with special reference to the distinction of the living and the not-living and the psychical elements in which religion and mythology, when the level of primitive human intelligence has been attained, miiay be stupposed to have their origini. The higher animals, it is found, as well as man, at first distinguish clearly between that which is alive and that which is not; but, undler the influence of the motive of self- preservation, evervthing, living, being a possible source of danger, comes to be attended to more closely than things without life. Thus life conies to be thought of as the only source of mlotion; and the way is now prepared for the confusion of the not-living with the living. This conftusion is not fully established till the myth-making stage ; but already in animals the first indications of it may be observed. The cause of the extraordinary development in man of "mythogenesis," as of other faculties, was "an external imnpulse," "a radical change in the conditions of existence of primitive man". To trace the effects of this change will be the object of the subsequent part of the work. Journal d'un Philosophe. Par LUCIEN ARR?AT. Paris: F. Alcall, 1887. Pp. 303.

Philosophies de la Nature. Bacon-Boyle-Toland--Buffon. Par NOUR- RISSON, Meniibre de 1' Iistitut. Paris: Perrin, 1887. Pp. cxix., 263. The author's ptirpose is to establish " that there is no solicl philosophy</page><page sequence="15">624 NEW BOOKS. of niature which is not foun(led on the ideas of the soul and of God," first by a general hiistorical sketch of philosophies of nature (pp. v.-cxix.), then by a series of " monographs " which are to serve as examples to justify the samne concltusions (pp. 1-263, "'Des idees d'esprit et de matiere dans la philosophie de Bacon," "Robert Boyle et 1' idee de nature," "Toland, Pantheisticon," "La philosophie de Buffon "). Antiquity, he finds, was dominated by the conception ex nihilo nihil. The charm is broken, and the true doctrine of creation and the ideas conlected with it are made dominant by Christianity. With the revolt of tlle Renaissanice, " Naturalism " reappears. Descartes and the French philo'sophy of the 17th century again restore Spiritualism, which again disappears in the renewed revolt (inspired by English philosophy) of the 18th century. This time Naturalism displays its frightfuLl practical consequences in the French Revolution. After " the unbridled Materialism of a second Renaissance," the 19th century, at its dawn, was to see again " a philosophy that should take care to harmonise itself with the necessities of practice, and should not disavow the fundamental notions of commion sense ". In Evolutionism- the Naturalism of the present day-philosophy has again fallen under " the magical and deplorable eimpire of words ". For what are Nature, Evolution and Matter? Sunt verbas et voces (p. xcv.). Among the " mono- giaphs,"' the analysis of Toland's Panttheisticon (pp. 85-196) is not without interest. The following passage, however, with some historical basis, reads rather curiously:- " Toland, qui, dans la re'daction de son Pantheis- ticon, s'etait certainement inspire des traditions magonniques fort anciennes en Analeterre ; Toland devait aussi, par cet ouvrage m1me, contribuer sans doute X la diffusion de la Franc-Magonnerie, qu'en 1725 introduisit en France lord Dervent-Waters (sic). Et en effet Pantheistes et Francs- Magons ne sont pas sans se rapprocher par plus d'une affinite"' (p. 172). Toland's controversial style, according to the author-who qualifies his ideas as " chimeeras," "politically intolerable," "pernicious and miserable diversions "-" va jusqu'- l'invective". M. Nourrisson is, he tells us, "de ceux qui exigent quL'on attache un sens precis aix termes qul'on emiploie; qui veulent que les idees quLe ces mots expriment soient claires ; qui surtout demiiandent aux faits, dans tout ordre de connaissances, la verification des thieories " (Preface, p. i.). After this claim to accuracy, it is disappointing to find Kepler's laws, Galileo's observations witlh the telescope and Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood all assigned to the 16th century (p. 4). L'Edtecation clu CaractOre. Par ALEXANDRE MARTIN, Charge cldu Cours de P6dagogie X la Facult6 des Lettres de Nancy. Paris: Hachette, 1887. Pp. 377. By "character" the autlhor understands "the sumli of the qualities that ar e presented,by two out of the three great faculties of the human soul, the sensibility and the will ". Modern educationi, lhe holds, assigns too mnuch importanice to the intelligence and too little to the character; and one ptirpose of his present "course of pedagogy"' is to make practical sug- gestions for the improvement of moral education in the home and in the school. Two chapters (iii., iv.) are devoted to consideration of the influence of heredity and nf physical temperament on the character; but first M. Martin compares the optimistic theory of Rousseau and the theory of " tlheological pessimism " as to the natural character of children, deciding that the last is nearer the truth. Children have no natural morality; "the conception of duty as a categorical imperative " being for a long time above their reasoni. "The natural iiicliniations of clhildhood " are divided inito three classes: "those that are indifferent from the point of view of</page><page sequence="16">NEW BOOKS. Gb52 morality; those that are conitrary to morality ; those that morality approves because it finds in them auxiliaries". The character that conduces to success in the struggle for existence, and the character that conforms to the higher moral ideal, are in many respects different. Which character, then, shall parents and teachers strive to produce? This question, it is suggested, may be ultimately insoluble without the assumption of a supernatural order ; but in practice it is partially resolved by the observation that the power of conquering the inclinations, of putting forth energy by ani effort of " free-will," is commnon to both characters. This power, therefore, is to be especially cultivated. The habit of obedience is favourable to the development of energy of will; but authority must not be all-embracing or too minute, and the space within which the free-will of the scholar can exercise itself should be gradually extended with advancing age. Science et Psychologie. Nouvelles CEuvrea inedites de MAINE DE BIRAN. Publiees avec une Introduction par ALEXIS BERTRAND, Professeur de Philosophie h la Faculte des Lettres de Lyon. Paris: E. Leroux, 1887. Pp. xxxiv., 352. All those who are of opinion that French thinking never reached a hiigher level than in Maine de Biran will welcome this important addition to the list of his published works. It conisists of six pieces under the following titles : (1) Rapports de 1' Ideologie et des Mathe'matiques, pp. 1-22 (2) Observations sur le Syst0me de Gall, pp. 23-71 ; (3) Commentaire sur les Me'ditations de Descartes, pp. 73-125; (4) Rapports des Sciences Naturelles avec la Psychologie, pp. 127-288 ; (5) Notes sur l'Abbe' de Lignac, pp. 289- 317; (6) Notes sur l'Ideologie de M. de Tracy, pp. 319-50. The first is from the period when Maiine de Biran still belonged to the ideological school; the others, falling within 1808-15, were written in his second period-of independent philosophical thought-before he passed into the mystic vein of his last years. It was the Commentary on Descartes, which Prof. Bertrand, the editor, wished to study, that first made him apply to M. E. Naville of Geneva, the possessor of Maine de Biran's MSS. M. Naville, who issued a fuill account of these in 1851, and who hiinself pub- lished in 1859 the three voluines that so effectively supplemented Cousin's four from the year 1834 (ten years after the philosopher's death), gave willing access to the whole miass of the unpublished writings, and it is not without the help of his experience and constant guidance that the present selection has been made. It comnes forth as vol. ii. of the "Library of the Faculty of Letters of Lyons," a series of independent volumes now substi- tuted for an earlier yearly publication of papers in history, literature and philosophy. Still miore important than the Commentary on the Meditations (i., ii., iv.), though that is of great value both intrinsically and for the uinderstanding of Maine de Biran's own development towards his latest phase of thought, is the fourth piece dealing with the relation of Psychology to the Natural Sciences. It is a mere fragment, but has not less interest now than when it was written as a plea for the independent scientific character of pure psychology, and it contains a scientific doctrine of reason an(d belief that is missed in the Essai sur les fondements de la Psychologie, the most finished work of Maine de Biran's pen (issued by M. Naville in 1859). Its relation to the Essai is very hard to determine. The conclusion to which M. Naville has finally come is that it dates from 1813, after the Essai was practically completed, btut, remaining itself incomplete, was passed over when, after a time of political distraction, the Essai was taken up againi and finally disposed of towards 1815. M. Bertrand had intended to include in the voluLme the correspondence of Maine de Biran with Cabanis, Ampere, Destnitt de Tracy and others, but this has had to be kept back for the present.</page><page sequence="17">626 NEW BOOKS. La Vie des Societes. Par le Dr. A. BORDIER, Professeur l1'Ecole dl'An- thropologie de Paris: C. Reinwald, 1887. Pp. xv., 359. The author's aim is to study "the natural history of societies," in the manner in which the growth of a plant or animal is studied. The "'physio- log,ical laws of the social organism " are to be deduced from the appropriate "documents"; the individual being "considerecl as a siniple anatomical element of the social body and studied successively in the miodifications which the number of the siniilar elements, their structure, their nutrition, their reproduction, their riches or their poverty may cause that organism to undergo ". The social organism is then to be studied in its evollution alnd in the various diseases to which it is subject. Lastly, the right methods of "social hygiene "-or legislation and education-are to be deduced. The "documents" which the author makes his basis are the restults obtained bv anthropologists and statisticians. These are set forth and discussed in accordance with his biological terminology. By the term "hygiene," he intends to signify the substitution of methods involving as little interference as possible with individual freedom, for the more violent methods of social " therapeutics ". This he regards as a reform in politics and education corresponding to the modern reform in medical treatlmlent. The philosophical writers by whom he has been most influenced are Buckle and Mr. H. Spencer. Opere Filosofiche di ROBERTO ARDIGa. IV. Sociolgia. 11 Compito dellca Filosofta e low suca PerennitO. II Fatto Psicologico della Percezione. Pa- dova: A. Draghi, 1886. Pp. 502. The first tlhree volumes of Prof. Ardig6's collected works were noticed in MIND xi. 291. Of the present volume the largest and most iinportant work is the Sociology (pp. 11-252). It may be regarded as a continuation of the Ethics of vol. iii. Elthics, ini the author's view, is a branch of the science called by Aristotle " Politics," and now called " Sociology" (p. 51). If a distinction between Politics and Sociology be maintained, Prof. Ardigb's work is rather political than sociological ; his theory of "the natural formation of justice " being developedc not simply with the pur pose of historical explanation, but with a view to the construction of a doctrine of political rights and duties. For the explanatioln of " the natural forma- tioii of justice," the general principle laid (lown is, "No justice without huiman society " (p. 96). The idea of juistice is forlmled from the experience of a conflict of powers. It becomes determinate in the form of legal duties and rights when the separate powers are brought into equilibrium bv a central governing power. To iiiake the formation of such a power conceiv- able, we must suppose in individuals an impulse, at first indeterm-inate, towards a social ideal. This " indiviclual consciousness of social ideality " is in its natture " anti-eaoistic ". When a svstem of legal rights and duties has been formed by the action of the central power, there appears a coIn- flict between legal right alnd what is called "natural right ". The con- sciousness of " natural riglhts " is a consciousness of " social idealities " not yet embodied in positive law. It is tliis, and not the rebellion of egoistic impulses, that is the motive force of revolutions. Ultimately "positive law " is deterlmined alnd justified by " natural law," or the law of the ideal state. "i Anti-egoistic social ideality," when it has become distinct, is rein- forced by the motives that at first gave its strength to egoism. The idea of moral justice, as it grows, is transferred from the act to the intention. The conception of acts of " charitv," "b beneficence " or " philanthropy,"' which go beyond what is strictly due, is formed. In the case of acts of strict justice, also, the consciousness of the "sanction,' thatz is, of the force exerted by societv to comnpel the observance of wlhat is just, tends to disappear.</page><page sequence="18">NEW BOOKS. 627 Ideas of " virttue " and " merit " then arise, which imply spontaneity of action and differences between different persons, as regards the degree of spontaneity; the virtue or merit of an action or a clharacter being greater in proportion as there is less direct consciousness of any external sanction. Before the ideas of "positive law," " natural law," "justice," &amp;c., arise in their distinction, there is a general notion of social " fitness " (convenienza); and there always remain, outside the kinids of conduct regulated by the central power, other kindls of coniduct, to which not the action of the central power, but only a less definite form of the social sanction is appli- cable. The requLirements of the ideal of human society, expressed in terms of the analogy between the social and the biological organism, are: (1) Autonomy of the parts; (2) Prevention of mutual violence; (3) Distinct constitution of the central power ; (4) Its constitution by selection of the best, in dependence on the will of the parts, in virtue of their social idealities, and to the end of the protection of the co-ordinatedI autonomies of the society; (5) Just and stable organisation and subordination of the parts corresponding to the stable and j ust organisation and efficacy of action of the power (p. 38). To every right correspclnds a duty; but every right -is not at the samie time a duty (pp. 130-1). The right to carry into effect an impulse towards the social ideal is at the same time a duty for the person exercising the right, while the right to exercise egoistic activities is in itself simply a right, though it miiay imply the duty of otlher persons not to interfere. Rights at once constitute the social organiisni and are deter- miiined by it (p. 227). The State has for its functions -"the protection of the rights of all," " the acquiisition of prosperity," " moral im- provement" (p. 249). Thus conceived, it is "the pure and complete realisation of social ideality, or of the principle of aiiti-egoi.1ic good, of moral good; in a word, of good for the sake of good ". Foi ii iii i -s; outline of some of its leading positions the importance of Prof. Ardigo's ethico- political work will be evident. As some account of his psychological anld general philosophical point of view has already been given in MIND, less need be said here of the two remaining works of the present volume. It mnay suffice to mention that the last, on The Psychological Fact of Perception, starts from a critical examination of Prof. Sergi's Physiological Theory of Perception (noticed in MIND vi. 154), and that the author's own doctrine is that " simple observation . . . gives only pure sensation; * for this to become a perception, it must be conijoined with experiment " (p. 345).

The greater part (pp. 5-116) of the first of these pieces is devoted to an exposition of the Darwinian tlheory of evolution by natural selection anid a defence of it against objectors ; the author then discusses "Problems started by Darwinism," "Darwinism and Philosophy," " Social Darwinismn," " Linguistic Darwinism," " Darwinisim and Cheiiistry," " Darwiniism and Astronomy ". With all its importance, " Darwinism is not the Alpha and Omega of science," and "mnuch less can it be the foundation of a philosophy. Philosophy and Darwinism are ideas that are perfectly separate but do not oppose one another. Not so Darwinism anid Theology; for dogma and research, science and faith, are ideas that absolutely exclude one another." There can be no " social Darwinism ". Social progress is not essentially the result of a struggle, but of intelligence ; thie various forms of social rivalry being "simple stinmuli ".

The short study of )reamxs, by the same author, starts from the theory of Delboeuf that all past experienice is preserved, and that everything in dreams can be ex- plained by the reappearance of miiemories of experiences forgotten in waking life. This theory, however, is insufficient, the author contends, unless a reason can be giveln why particular mnelmlories are selected rather than others. He finds the required explanation in the suppression of volition and the predominance of emlotion, which, in dreams, acts as "the condenser of experiences ". Dreams are " the natural lyricisnm of life ". From this follows the prophetic clharacter of some dreams and presentimenits. The disturbing action of the self-interested motives characteristic of volition being removed, ideas of desired or dreaded events are free to group them- selves in their true relations. The apparent fuilfilment of a dream or presentiment may also in soime cases be an illusion. For it is a law of emnotion that heightened and depressed states of feeling tend to alterniate ; and thuis a dreain miiay be expressive of the mood that contrasts with that which has been experienced immnediately before it in waking life, and the evenits occurrilig after the dream may be seen. through the medium of this (still continued) " consecutive emotion ".

The general conclusion of this history of the theory of knowledge in Greek philosophy is that on the whole no important results were attained either as regards the nature, origin oi validity of knowledge, because theorv of knowledge was not studied " ex professo and independently," but continued to be dependent on and limited by metaphysical and ethical theories. As regards the questioii of the origin of knowledge, the author iiakes an exception in favour of the Stoics, who, he holds, conibined the truth that is in sensationalismii with the tru-th that is in nativism, by their acceptance of an empiricism mo(lified by the recognition that perception is not a inere affection of sense caused by external objects, but involves an activitv of the mind. As regards the nature and validity of knowledge, Greek philosophy in general reinained essentially dogmatic, ill the spirit of the early physical schools ; while its sceptical doctrines ended in absolute nihilismn. An exceptioln to this j udgment is made in favour of the " phenomeiialism " of iEnesidemus, who had the merit of seeing that knowledge is not adequate to the object, btit is relative to the knowing subject, " so that we know only our representations, that is, phenomiena, and never their substratum, that is, things-ini-themselves ". "This doc- trine, however, is entirely isolated and was not recognised in its import- ance alnd extension, but only served a practical aim, so that, in spite of the just coliceptions of the Stoics and of XAnesidemus, we nmay conclude that Greek philosophy in genieral neither succeeded in making an important and valid contribution to the formiiation of Epistemology, nor in explaining the liature, origin anid validity of knowledge."

In this inauguLral lecture, delivered by him on assuming temporarily the post of Prof. Barzellotti, now transferred to another university, the auithor states his general view of the Problems of Plhilosophy of History. He insists, against those who wish to consider history as one of the natural</page><page sequence="20">NEW BOOKS. 629 sciences, on 'the distinctions of its subject-matter; pointing out, for example, the impossibility of inferring from the phvsical characters, such as the form of the skulls of the Mediterranean races, the character of a pro- duct such as Greek art (pp. 20-1). Philosophy, he says, has the riglht to protest against the exaggerations of a doctrine that regarcls history as determined simply by external needs, just as it had the right to protest against the exaggerations of the opposite doctrine of a spirit acting by mere internal impulse and making its way ulnaffected by obstacles (pp. 41-2). He criticises the ideas of progress and of the unity of history, and contends for an "epigenetic " as distingtuished from an evolutionary view of the origins of civilisation. Ueber das Schdne. Analytische und historisch-kritische Untersuchungen. Von Dr. JULIus BERGMANN, ord. Professor der Philosophie anl der Universitat zu MarbuLrg. Berlin: E. S. Mittler und Sohn, 1887. Pp. 201. Before proceeding to the historico-critical studies that form the greater part of this volume, the author defines with extremie care the nature of vesthetic emotion. His principal concluLsions are these. A pleasure, to be aesthetic, mtust be a pleasure felt in miere contemplation. What is contem- plated mav be either a perception, or an imnagination, or a state of subjec- tive feeling aroused by a perception or imagination. A beautiful object may have a worth for feeling independent of mere contemiplation; in order to recognise its beauty, an intellectual process may be necessary: but the oesthetic pleasure is something distinct, though perhaps not separable, from any other value of the object for feeling; and the subsidiary intellectual process .s not to be regarded as itself sesthetic, because it is necessary to the existence of the cesthetic pleasure. Beauty is subjective; that is, a thing or a phenomenon is beautiful for a subject contemplating it, and not in itself apart from every possible subject. From the doctrine that beauty is some- thing residing in an absolute object-the doctrine of the " speculative " or "c osmolooical " systems of post-Kantian aesthetics-is to be distinguished Herbart's doctrine of the " objectivity " of beauty, which is a psychological theory, not inconisistent with the doctrine of its "subjectivity" in the author's sense. Such a view, and in particular the doctrine that beauty is subjective, the author regards as the result finally attained by the move- ment of aesthetics in Germany since Kant. The cosmological point of view has now, as he puts it, been replaced by the psychological poilit of view, which may henceforth be regarded as a common possession. The problem of cesthetics is recognised as being to determine the nature and conditions of cesthetic enjoyment, not the liature of the beautiful as it is in itself. The principal cesthetic writers discussed in the historical part of the book are Kant, Herbart,and Schopenhauer. The critical examination of their con- clusiolus is made the basis of further analysis. .Die drei metaphysichen Frccgen nach Immanuel Kant's Prolegomena zu einer jeden kiinftigen Metaphysik, die als Wissenschaft wird aucftreten kdnnen beantwortet von F. V. VON WVASSERSCHIEBEN. Berlin: C. Duncker (9. Heynions), 1887. Pp. vii., 115. The author has proposed to himself to construct a metaphysics in the sense of Kant's Proleqomenc&amp; zi einer jeden kilnftigen Metaphysik, on the basis of modern science. The writers from whom he has received most influence are, as he mentions, F. A. Lange and Prof. Wundt. He proceeds to ask the answer, on scientific grounds, to each of Kant's three questions taking the, three "Ildeas,"' the Psychological, the Cosmological and the Theological, or Immortality, Freedom, God, in the order given. "The</page><page sequence="21">630 NEW BOOKS. original ground of all things," according to mlodern science, is found to be " force ". Matter and consciousness are the same in essence, both being alike manifestations of force; but the law of psychical force is different from the law of physical force, being (as stated by Prof. Wundt) a law of constant increase instead of a law of equivalence. Human consciousness is the result of a process of development out of nmatter. " The soul is nothing substantial or enduring, and the identity of the Ego is only an apparent identity." What is permanent is the structure of the organism. On the ground of science, therefore, personal immortality must be denied. The antinomies that spring from- the Cosmological Idea are due to neglect of the distinction between " material " and " psychical " force and (consequently) causality. Man, as regards his body, is subject to natural laws ; but through the presence in him of spirit he is a cause of the beginning of motion, and is free in so far as he is liot under the dominion of impulses from his lower nature. The human will is determined by the divine will; in which alone necessity coincides with freedoin. Passing to the Theological Idea, the author finds that the con- ception of a " world-consciousness " is a necessary conception. For " the history of nature is the history of the progressive victory of spirit over matter" ; and this supposes a directing intelligence. A complete world- colisciousness, however, can only be posited at the beginnino and at the end of the world-process. That the motion of matter will terminate and the world-process have an absolute end, follows from the law of the degra- dation of all forms of energy into heat. On the other hand, " everything living springs from life; the inorganic springs from the organic and has been formed by vital activity ". Matter is the " bouind," spirit the " free," force. If, then, we proceed from consciousness as the more certain, we niust assume that the free world-consciousness has bound itself by laws willed by itself. Force, therefore, originally present as world-conscious- ness, transformed itself into the unconscious or matter for the sake of an end proposed to itself, and will again emerge from the world-process as world-consciousness. " In the beginning was God, and nothinig outside Him. God has transformed Himself into the world, and the world will again return to itself in God." " The world-process is a struggle of the unconscious witlh itself according to natural laws willed by God before the beginning of Creation." The purpose of the transformation of the unity of the world-consciousness into separate single beings by the intermediate stage of the unconscious or matter, was an intensification of mental force. The only other purpose of the world-process that can be known by us is the storing up of memories of a world-historv for the sake of the future complete world-consciousness. For although individual memory dis- appears at death, " the unconscious memory of Nature is true and ineradi- cable" ; and the memories of all the states of consciousness of all indi- viduals are preserved, to reappear at " the new birtlh of the spirit," when all shall again " live in God ". Ethically, all actions are to be estimated by their relation to the world-process. To prom-note this is "the divine command," which is identical with " the well-understood interest of man " Sin is what opposes and prolongs the world-process." Abendrote. Psychologische Betrachtungen. Von PAUL LANZKY. Berlin: C. Duncker (C. Heymons), 1887. Pp. 134. This book is composed of a series of detachedi "thoughts," arranged under twelve heads, on life, philosophy and art. It purports to be written by a once pessimistic thinker, who has become reconciled to human life by retiring into solitude, yet without wishing again to leave his solitude; for by withdrawal from the world he has both recovered from misanthropy</page><page sequence="22">NEW BOOKS. 631 and learnt to be self-sufficing. The single reflections are often very sug- gestive, and have always a stamp of individuality. So far as the book conveys a general view of life, it is summed up in the motto from Mon- taigne which is placed on the title-page :--"La plus grande chose dt monde, c'est de sgavoir estre a soy," and in a " thought " of Leopardi (from whom the author has taken the motto of one of his twelve chapters): "H e who communicates little with men is rarely a misanthrope. True misanthropes are not found in solitude, but in the world. . . . And if one who is such retires from society, he loses in retirement his misan- thropy " (Pensieri, lxxxix.). Die Willensfreiheit des Mllenschen. Von. Fr. J. MACH, k.k. Professor am Staats-Obergymnasium in Saaz. Paderborn u. Mfinster: F. Schoningh, 1887. Pp. ix., 274. The author seeks to establish the doctrine of free-will, not by deduction from principles, but " on the real basis of concrete inductive facts". Thus " science and life, theory andl practice, psychology and practical moral in- terests" are to be reconciled, and the right of punishment exercised by society and the State to be justified. From the proof, to be given after- wards, that animals have no free-will, the falsehood of Materialism and of the philosophy of Schopenhauer is to be inferred. The distinction of kind between men and animals will thus be maintained ; and the proof of the free-will of man will gain its full evidence. The experience on which the doctrine of free-will is to be based is "internal experience" * but first the author sets out to refute the doctrines he regards as false. His 'preli- minary positions are that "freedom is not absolute indeterminism,' and that " freedom is not absoltite determinism ". He examines at consider- able length (pp. 35-111) the variou-s forms of determinism, viz. (1) " Exter- nal determinism " (the theological predestination of Luther, Calvin and Wycliff, and the determinism of Spinoza) (2) " Mechanico-physical or materialistic determinism" (Biichner, &amp;c.); (3) "Internal or inechanico- psychological determinism " (Leibniz, Herbart); (4) " Metaphysical or pantheistic deterininism " (Sclhelling, Hegel, Hartmann). All these doc- trines are incompatible with "the feeling of repentance, the fact of con- science, moral responsibility ". The true doctrine of freedom is that of "relative indeterminism" or of a limited power of free choice (pp. 112- 150). In the remainder of the book, objections are replied to (pp. 150-70), and the positions are defended at length-(1) that " true freedom is moral freedom " (pp. 171-203); (2) that "responsibility is a consequence of lhuman freedom " (pp. 204-21); (3) that "free-will does not belong to animals, but only instinctive activity" (pp. 222-40). There is an historical appendix (pp. 241-74) tracing the problem of free-will from antiquity to mnodern times. The true doctrine of free-will, the author contends, first became possible in the Christian era (pp. 249-50) ; and in his historical section, as elsewhere, he is careful to point out that there is no incompatibility between the doctrine of a limited free-will and the Scholastic doctrine, represented above all by Thomas Aquinas, that the will is necessarily determined to strive after " good generally" or " happiness " (pp. 256-7 and 140-4). Reproduction, Gefiihl und Wille. Von Dr. RIcHARD VON SCHUBERT- SOLDERN, Privatdocenten der Universitat Leipzig. Leipzig: Fues (R. Reisland), 1887. Pp. xv., 135. The aim of this book, as stated by the author, is to show how " feeling" -that is, " pleasure and pain "-is the determining factor of all thought and action. Like his other works, it has in view " the analysis of the im- mediately given"; for this, he holds, must in any case precede metaphy-</page><page sequence="23">632 NEW BOOKS. sics-if metaphysics be supposed possible. Starting from the distinctioh ar- rived at in his Grtndlctgen einer Erkenntnisstheorie (see MIND x. 310) between the point of view of " natural science " and the point of view of " psycho- logy," he shows that as the body is the centre to which everything belonlg- ing to the external world or the world of perception appears as in relation, so:feeling is the centre for the relations of the internlal world or the world of representation. Through the body, itself a group of perceptions, all perceptions are mediately in relation with the internal world, and so with feeling. Feeling, which appears on the one side as determinecl by repro- dtuction of presentations, on the other side determines it. With feeling, desire ancl volition are inseparably bound up. The work, accordingly, falls into three divisions, dealing respectively with Reproduction, Feeling and Will, which are subdivided as follows :--Section i. c. 1, "Reproduction," 2, " Associatioln," 3, " Abstraction ancl Reflectioni" ; Section ii. c. 1, " The Life of Feeling in general," 2, "The Life of Feeling in particular"; Section iii. c. 1, " Necessity," 2, "Wish and Will," 3, " Free-will". Nearly all psychical phenomena, in the author's view, can be partially ex- plained by the recognised laws of association; but associationists have neglected feeling, which, though it does not itself associate ideas but only directs and strengthens associations, is yet of the greatest importance (p. 26). Abstraction, again, cannot be fully explained by resemblance ancl more frequent repetition in consciousness of certain representations. For complete explanation, it has to be seen that the representations to which the strongest feelings of pleasure anid pain are attached come into the fore- ground, andl that thus attention directs itself to these and they are most strongly distinguished. ,ltimately. every intellectual as well as every volitional process is to be p i l1ii ii by reference to pleasure or avoidance of pain, which alone has "value ". "Necessity " is reduced psychologically to a form of expectation; "physical necessity " being defined as the expec- tation of futture perceptions in accordance with past perceptions, " psychi- cal necessity" as the expectation of future representations and feelilngs in accordance witlh the past. In the last chapter the author contends that " freedom of choice," without "freedom of will," is a sufficient basis of ioral responsibility. Geschichte der Ethik. Darstellung der philosophischen Moral-, Staats- und Social- Theorien des Alterthums und der Neuzeit. Von Dr. KARL K6STLIN, o.o. Professor an der Universitat Tiibingen. Erster Band: Die Ethik des classischen Alterthums. Erste Abtheilung. Tiibingen: H. Laupp, 1887. Pp. xii., 493. This promises to be a very fiull history of ethical and political theories in ancient and modern times. It is called a " History of Ethics" ; but, as the author tells us, he understands by "E Ethics " not merely the science of morality, but the whole of practical philosophy, including, in particular, the philosophy of society and the State (p. 6). The present volume takes in the pre-Socratics, the Sophists and Socrates, Plato and the older Acadenmy. The exposition of doctrinies is preceded by a general initroduc- tion on practical. philosophy, its subject-matter, its methods and its divisions (pp. 1-115), and by a special introduction on the character of Greek Ethics and its sourtes in Greek life (pp. 119-159). The three chief questions that practical philosophy must ask are found to be: (1) What are the ends of human action? (2) What are its laws? (3) What are the con- dlitions of the realisation of human ends and laws ? A principal point of the last investigation is to determine the real objective order to be given to the collective life of men in order that the ends and laws of man may be realised. Ancient and modern Ethics are to be specially studied, because</page><page sequence="24">NEW BOOKS. 633 it is only in ancient andl modern times that the attemipt has been ma(le to work out a practical philosophy on purely philosophical grounds. The Ethics of classical antiquity has permanent interest (1) because, scientifi- cally, it created moral, social and political philosoplhy, and stated all possible views of the end of life, (2) because of its " ideal direction ". Its idealism consists in its telling men to seek as their end both personal per- fection and the perfection of the political society in which they live. This idealism, however, lhas a " naturalistic element ; perfection being held to consist entirely in the unfolding of natural dispositions. The recognition that the highest end of all is conformnity to a binding " mnoral law " is absent. Hence ancient Ethics, in its view of the destination of man, has not attained comiiplete "spirituality ". Christianity, deriving the conception of moral law from Jtudaismi, replaced ancient " naturalisnii " by " spiritual- ism". In the Middle Ages, spiritualism was exaggerated into a duialismll that placed the spirit in antagonism to reality. In modern times, the real regained its rights ; and at the samiie tiIne there has been a constant effort to reconcile ancient naturalism with Christian spiritualism. All the branches of practical philosophy have also been studied niore thoroughly and comnpletely, " so that now for the first timne a true philosophy of human things, of human interests and human ideals as a whole, has been created ". Ueber die wxhren Ursachen. Eine Studie von Dr. S. STRICKER, Universitats- Professor in Wien. Wien: A. Hl6der, 1887. Pp. 60. This investigation of what is meant by " cause " was startecl by Hume's doctrille of causality, and proceeds oln the basis of the psychological results arrived at by the author in his Studien iiber die Bewegungsvorstellungen (1882), here briefly recapituilated. The perception of motion, he con- cluded in the former work, caninot have been acquired by the fusion of nmere passive sensations, bult always depends on a determination of action or incipient action of muscles. In volition, nmuscular movenient follows immediately upon innervation of miiotor nerves, and is felt as in direct quan- titative relation (though not strictly proportional) to the intensity of the felt iinnervation that prece(les it. It is to this type that all motion is primi- tively referred. External maotions, since their pereeption is involuntary, are referred to a will external to that of the percipient ; those that do not proceed from other mnen or froni animiials being referred to invisible living beings. For will, physical science substitutes " force," which is merely will depersonalised; and, by a speculative extension of the conception of force, the apparently spontaneous beginnings of action in volition are themiselves traced back to pre-existing forces. The search for causes, therefore, is grounded in our initernial experience. It is not to be explained, as Hume explains it, by observed customary conjunctions of events in the external world ; but is the reference of an event which, as soon as perceived, deter- mines in us motor feelings, to the type of the production of such feelings which exists in ourselves. And in amly particular case we seek the true cause of an event either by active experiment or by comparison with pre- vioIIs active experiments of which we possess the results in the formi of the "potential knowledge" that constituites " connmon-sense": we do not simply call any custonlary antecedent the "cause " of its c onsequent. A " truie cause" is the "origin" or "source" of matter or motion (" Ursache "= "Ursprung " or " Urquelle "). As the " cause " of any particular portion of matter is that portion of matter pre-existing somiewhere else, so the " cause " of the force or motion possessed by any portion of matter is that sanme quantity of force or miiotionl possessed by soime other portioIn of Matter. The law of cauisality is therefore identical with the " law of con- seivation " of physics. (Time ,author promises to defend, in a second part of 41</page><page sequence="25">634 NEW BOOKS. the Study, his use of the term " force " or " motion " in preference to " work" or " eniergy".) Tlle character of the law of causality or conservation is that which Kant says would belongi to it if drawn friom experience ; that is to say, it has only " emlpirical universality " anid not " necessity "; altlhough the absence of tlhe character of necessity does not follow, as Kant holds, simply from the experiential origin of the law. Probleme der Lebensweisheit. Betrachtungen von Jf3RGEN BONA MEYER, Zweite Auflage. Berlin: Allgemeiner Verein fur deutsche Literatuir, 1887. Pp. vi., 369. This volume opens with a collection of proverbs, of various nations, re- lating to the training and education of children (i. " Erziehungsweisheit im Spricllwort "). The author then goes on to discuss some of the questions suggested in his opening study ; proceeding from discussions of " Play" and of " Natural Disposition and the Choice of a Vocation " to consideration of the differences between Genius and Talent and the training of the Imagina- tion and the Mermiory. Essays on questions of casuistry and oni the diffe- rent types of moral systems are followed by a series of essays (ix.-xiii.) in which the author opposes the pessimism of Schopenhauer and Hartinain and seeks to substitute for it a molderate optimism, botlh as regards the indi- vidual life and the future of the race.

Mit erlauternden Holzschnitten. Leipzig: M. A. Schmidt, 1887. Pp. 140. This is an interpretation of the facts of psychology in the interests of a materialistic view of the world. The authior's materialism is, however, modified by the positions (1) that we do not know what matter is in itself ; (2) that every atom has an element of feelinlg attached to it, and that it is out of the combinations of these feelings that intellect arises. Nature has an end that is not to be expressed ini anthropomorphic terms. The end for wlhich living being,s are evolved is neither happiness (as the pessimiists think it ought to be) nor knowledge (as idealists imagine), but simply "orientation"in the system of things; the brain being tle great "organ of orientation ". Idealism is an expression of the arrogance of man ; but this arrogalnce is an artifice of Natuire devisedl to intensify jnan's energy for a belief that he is at the summit of things furnislhes him with a power- ful motive to action. Hence the nmajority will always be favourable to idealistic doctrines. A few see through this illusion, "descend fromii the miock throne of the Ego," alnd miiake their brain-miiechanism a mirror of the mechanical processes of the real world. " This mirroriing of the miyechanical world-process in our brain is indeed an imperfect, a fragmentary one. It will be comuplete and all-revealing only in the world-ilntellect that. develops itself out of the whole fundanmental scale of feeling, in which accordingly the inechanical process will be able to mirror itself in all its modalities."

These psychoplhysical researches, on the senise for degree of intensity of light, made by the " method of contrasts " so largely employed by Del- boeuf, have yielded the following results :--" (1) In some cases a geo- metrical series of physical stimuli corresponids, as the law of Weber requiires, to the arithnmetical series of differences of sensation : this geo- maetrical seijes of stimuli then calls forth a series of reciprocal contrasts of equal intensity; (2) in otlher cases, and indeed the most, the law of Weber does not apply: but in those cases contrasts of equal intensity correspond to no geomletrical series of stimuli " (p. 73).
