<plain_text><page sequence="1">A VIRGILIAN ECHO IN JUVENAL'S ELEVENTH SATIRE In Satire 11 Juvenal rejects the excessive luxury of banquets and invites Persicus to a frugal dinner at his home. He describes the modest courses of food to be served (11.64-76); among these there will be fresh eggs: grandia praeterea tortoque calentia feno ova adsunt ipsis cum matribus ... (11. 70-71 ) The phrase grandia ova ipsis cum matribus represents a charac- teristically Juvenalian image with its overtones of both the ludi- crous and the grotesque through its implied anthropomorphism: the chicks in their shells, perceived as living yet still unborn beings, call to the reader's mind the unborn human children threatened with abortion at Sat. 6.596 {homines in ventre necandos; cf. 6.599: pueris salientibus [se. in utero]). As he frequently does elsewhere, Juvenal in Satire 1 1 employs a vivid and highly imaginative short vignette to make his point. Inasmuch as it occurs in the context of a frugal dinner set against the Gegenbild of luxurious banquets, we may well wonder if Juvenal's inspiration for these two lines might not be found in epic poetry, particularly since banquets and food are among the basic themes of both epic and satire. But first a brief examination of Juvenal's choice of words. Considered in and by itself, Juvenal's use of the term mater in an animal context is not surprising1). The expression also occurs elsewhere, chiefly in order to describe the parent of a vitulus or agnus2). Most frequently, we find the term in the context of grand literature, especially heroic epic; particularly in epic similes the aforementioned anthropomorphism becomes prominent. Thus, at Aen. 9.59-64, Turnus is compared to a wolf threatening the lambs in their sheepfold; they, however, are tuti sub matribus (9.61). In Statius' Tbebaid, the vigor of Hippomedon, warding off his at- tackers, is compared to that of a mother cow defending her young 1) Cf., e.g., Lucret., Rer. Nat. 2.349-50; Virgil, Aen. 8.632; Col., Res Rust. 7.9.1; Pliny, Nat. Hist. 11.49. 2) At least as early as Varrò, Res Rust. 2.2.15, and as late as Stat., Theb. 7.397.</page><page sequence="2">376 Martin M. Winkler from the onslaught of a wolf (Theb. 9.115-19). In the same book of the Thebaid, young Parthenopaeus is likened to a lion whose mother used to feed the cub cruentos cibos (9.739-43); this simile is followed by a catalogue of the heroes Parthenopaeus slays in bat- tle. The mother sheep or cow lends herself particularly well to such an anthropomorphic image in scenes describing her desperate search for lost or slaughtered offspring; the most famous example for this is the extended episode at Lucret., Rer. Nat. 2.352-703). Even the juxtaposition of mater and ovum is not exclusive to Juvenal (although quite Juvenalian in spirit and mocking tone); we find another example for this in Ovid (Fast. 4.696). In a context foreshadowing Juvenal's eleventh satire, Martial speaks of ova matrum at 7.31. 14). Juvenal's "eggs with their mothers" is, how- ever, the more outrageous collocation in that the satirist employs epic diction (grandia) for the purpose of deflation as well as of undercutting his own circumstances by sarcasm5); this, of course, is one of his chief satiric strategies. Stylistic grandiosity in a con- text calling for the Low Style (such as a humble dinner) serves a dual purpose: it makes the satirist's description of his subject more vivid to his listener or reader while simultaneously satirizing the standards of traditional literary decorum. Thus it is not surprising that his phrase grandia ova ipsis cum matribus should not only have been inspired by Martial (through ova matrum), but ulti- mately hark back even to the greatest epic in Roman literature, as a direct verbal parallel will make evident. Toward the end of Book I of the Aeneid, Virgil gives a ¿detailed account of the lavish banquet with which Dido entertains Aeneas and his men. Preparatory to the description of this dinner, Virgil emphasizes the queen's humanity and misericordia by hav- ing her provide food and drink to Aeneas' companions who have stayed behind on their ships: 3) This Lucretian passage is imitated by Ov., Fast. 4.459-60, who compares Ceres searching for her daughter with a cow looking for her lost calf. 4) Gilbert Highet, Juvenal's Bookcase, AJP 72 (1951) 371 and note 7, refers to several passages from Martial as the basis for Satire U.E. Courtney, A Com- mentary on the Satires of Juvenal (London 1980) 490-91, discusses Mart. 5.78 and 10.48 among sources for Satire 11. Robert E. Colton, Dinner Invitation: Juvenal 11.56-208, CB 41 (1965) 41, adduces Mart. 7.31.1 as the source for Juvenal's choice of matres for gallinae. Cf. also Mart. 3.58. 37-40. 5) Kenneth Weisinger, Irony and Moderation in Juvenal XI, Calir. Stud. Class. Ant. 5 (1972) 234, speaks of Juvenal's mock-epic "catalogue of dishes." He translates grandia ova as "lordly eggs," following G. G. Ramsey, Juvenal and Per- sius, rev. ed. (Cambridge, Mass., and London 1940) 227.</page><page sequence="3">A Virgilian Echo in Juvenal's Eleventh Satire 377 nee minus interea sodis ad litora mittit viginti tauros, magnorum horrentia centum terga suum) pinguis centum cum matribus agnos, muñera laetitiamque dii6). (1 .633-36) Close comparison of Virgil's phrase pinguis centum cum matribus agnos in line 635 with Juvenal's grandia ova ipsis cum matribus shows that the satirist in all likelihood had this Virgilian passage (and the banquet following it) in mind when he composed the section of Satire 11 in which he describes his own cena. The fact that Juvenal does not openly acknowledge or otherwise indicate Virgil as his source does not invalidate this view; after all, Juvenal often borrows without admission of this fact - indeed, poetic indi- rection is an integral feature of his frequently allusive style7). It should therefore not come as a surprise that Juvenal refrains from any explicit reference to Dido's feast. But the verbal congruity of the expressions referring to the mother animals {cum matribus) is a clear indication that Virgil even more than Martial is his ultimate inspiration here. Virgil's pinguis describing the lambs finds its counterpart in Juvenal's grandia for the eggs - a highly sardonic application of a Grand-Style adjective to a trivial subject. Moreover, grandia has another correspondence in Virgil's mag- norum of line 634. While Virgil's numerals sensibly find no parallel in Juvenal, the satirist, not to be outdone by the epicist, however reinforces the phrase he adopts by placing an intensifying pronoun (ipsis) before it. And while ne is too poor to match viginti tauros or centum terga suum, he will nevertheless serve a pinguissimus haedulus (11.65-66). In typically Juvenalian fashion, the superla- tive of the adjective - which is, after all, the same word which Virgil had employed to describe his lambs - is undercut by the diminutive in the noun following it. Final confirmation that Juvenal in all likelihood had Virgil's lines in mind for the passage under consideration lies in the fact that, directly after mentioning the eggs, the satirist turns to the wine he will serve (servatae I parte anni quotes fuerant in vitibus 6) On the variant readings at line 636 {dii-dei-diei) see R. G. Austin, P. Vergili Maronis Aeneidos Liber Primus (Oxford 1971) ad ìoc. 7) On this aspect ot Juvenal s satiric technique, especially as exemplified in his seventh satire, see the important work by David S. Wiesen, Juvenal and the Intellectuals, Hermes 101 (1973) 464-83; cf. also David Sweet, Juvenal's Satire 4: Poetic Uses of Indirection, Calif. Stud. Class. Ant. 12 (1979) 283-303. I make a similar point in my paper, Juvenal's Attitude toward Ciceronian Poetry and Rhetoric, RhM 131 (1988) 84-97.</page><page sequence="4">378 Martin M. Winkler uvae&gt; 11. 71-72), just as Virgil had rounded off the list of Dido's gifts to Aeneas' men by mentioning wine (line 636). To be sure, wine is to be expected at any feast; Juvenal's periphrasis in the Grand Style, however, imitates Virgil's metonymy as well as simultaneously mocking both his own humble status and the epic banquet tradition. That Juvenal, a poet who regularly employs the Grand Style of epic (and of tragedy; cf. Sat. 6.634-37) as one of his chief stylistic devices for satirization, was highly familiar with Virgilian poetry has long been recognized8). Even a short vignette such as the one discussed here well serves to illustrate not only the extent of Juvenal's familiarity with Virgil but also once again underscores the method and purpose of his literary borrowings. In fact, another reference to the Aeneid had occurred even before the passage in Satire 11 examined here; at lines 60-63 Juvenal names Evander and refers to Aeneas (and Hercules) in one of his typical periphrases (cf. Aen. 8.100 and 359-65, especially line 364). Toward the end of Satire 11 we find an appropriate tribute to Virgil - although not one lacking a mocking overtone - when Juvenal, mentioning Homer and Virgil as the poets whose works are to be recited at his convivium, implies that the latter's poetry might even win out over the former's: conditor Iliados cantabitur atque Maronis altisoni dubiam facientia carmina palmam9). (180-81) To Juvenal's eleventh poem, the Aeneid represents nothing less than a substratum underlying the whole satire, culminating in his reference to Virgil by name. Since this occurs in the context of a dinner invitation, it is surely no undue inference to assume that Juvenal had Dido's feast, the best-known and most significant banquet in the Aeneid, in mind for the description of his own cena. George Mason University Martin M. Winkler 8) For instance Highet, Juvenal the Satirist (Oxford 1954) 246 note 3, rightly calls Virgil "one of his [Juvenal's] chief models." See also Highet, Juvenal's Book- case (note 4, above), 387-88, and Johannes Gehlen, De Iuvenale Vergilii Imitatore (Göttingen 1886), on which, however, cf. Highet, ibid., 388 note 35. On epic in Juvenal cf. my paper, The Function of Epic in Juvenal's Satires, in Studies in Latin Literature and Roman History V, ed. Carl Deroux (Brussels 1989) 414-443. 9) Highet, Juvenal s Bookcase (note 4, above), 388, reternng to these lines, calls Virgil "the author Juvenal himself says he loved" - perhaps an overinterpreta- tion as well as a lapse into biographical speculation. On the comparison of Homer and Virgil see the references cited by Courtney (note 4, above) on Sat. 6.436.</page></plain_text>
