<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nepri, husband of Tayet',51 thus reflecting the relation of the two deities and their functions. In the Book of the Dead, the deceased expects bread from Hathor and linen garments from the hand of Tayet,52 and is assumed to eat bread 'on a small rectangular cloth which Tayet herself has woven'.53 This offering of bread perpetuates their connection into the Graeco-Roman Period, when Hathor was given the name of Tayet.54 The association with Hedjhotep has another dimension. From his first appearance in the Middle Kingdom, he is connected both to Tayet and to the eye of Horus, who are together responsible for the bandages offered to the deceased in the name of Hedjhotep, considered to be the masculine homologue of Tayet.55 Consequently, he was widely regarded as Tayet's consort in Edfu and Dendara during the Graeco-Roman Period.56 One may assume that this situation brought Tayet further familial relationships. Thus, Re became her father and Nut her mother,57 and the king was engendered as a son by Tayet herself.58 Finally, one may deduce that, in the beginning, the word Tit.(t) referred interchangeably to either the goddess or the cloth, without any further distinction. Also, it is conceivable that Tayet as a goddess was not considered an imageable deity until the first millennium, when she made her first appearance in scenes. At that time her embodiment in anthropomorphic form reflected human normality, which found ready acceptance among the worshippers. Moreover, one may assume that her widespread appearance in the Graeco-Roman Period was based on many factors, such as her early connection with kingship, either direct or symbolic, and also her assimilation to Horus and Isis in this particular sphere. Her function played a very important role in assuring her continued popularity after the Pharaonic period, since the use of bandages for embalming persisted. Subsequently, she adopted other funerary roles, such as providing the bread offering and milk. This position was strengthened by her connection with most of the prominent deities in the Egyptian pantheon, whom she provided with ornamental garments. In these ways, it is clear that Tayet's relationship to the other gods evolved in a manner beyond her funerary functions. Finally, by the Graeco-Roman Period, Tayet's greater prominence appears to have led also to the creation for her of family relationships among the gods. HASSAN EL-SAADY Tutankhamun's sarcophagus: an addition and two corrections Further notes to the author's recent publication of the sarcophagus. WHILE it is true that Carter's notes for Obj. no. 240 [the sarcophagus] do not include any comment on the various discolourations that can be seen on Burton's photographs of the box,1 information is forthcoming from another source. In the second volume of Carter's publication on the tomb's discovery, Alfred Lucas noted the presence of a fungus not only on the walls of the burial chamber (where it was 'so plentiful as to cause great disfigurement') but also, if 'only to a slight extent, on the walls of the Antechamber and on the outside of the sarcophagus.'2 Though 'dry and apparently 51 F.

The size of the cavity hollowed out of the box to accommodate the coffins of the king should of course have been expressed in cubic, rather than square, metres. MARIANNE EATON-KRAUSS 3 Cf.
