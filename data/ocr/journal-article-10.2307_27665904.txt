<plain_text><page sequence="1">Norwood H. Andrews, Jr. An Essay on Cam?es' Concept of the Epic An understanding of the epic as a work essentially nationalistic lies at the base of Luis de Cam?es' concept of the form; proof that it lies there is offered by the chauvinistic and pragmatic nature of his own great contribution to the genre. His appeal to the Portuguese nation in behalf of collective action to coun teract the dry rot of growing corruption within the state and the "grand design" to establish a Portuguese-Christian empire in the East are expressed clearly and often.1 Moreover, and perhaps more to the point, two of his models provided him with ample ?eason to believe that epic was nationalistic before all else. Er nest Crum states that "the Greeks looked upon the Homeric poems as the summum bonum of their literature, ? they were considered by them as national epics. Homer was "The Poet."2 1. Cam?es' exhortation of D. Sebasti?o to make war on the Moslems in Morocco at the end of the tenth Canto and such moralizing passages as the following are offered here as sufficient demonstration of this point: Nem cre?ais, Ninfas, n?o, que tama desse A quem ao bem comum e do seu Rei Antepuser seu pr?prio int?resse, Imigo da divina e humana lei. Nenhum ambicioso que quisesse Subir a grandes cargos cantarei, S? por poder com torpes exerc?cios Usar mais largamente de seus vicios. ***** Aqueles sos direi que aventuraram Por seu Deus, por seu Rei a amada vida, Onde, perdcndo~a, em fama a dilataram, T?o bem de suas obras merecida. . .

George Mylonas er al (St. Louis, 1953), Vol. II, p. 645.</page><page sequence="2">62 Because the nation state is not a Greek concept, this is somewhat of an oversimplification, but Crum goes on to point out that "the Greek heroes [in the Iliad] are fighting a great war, ? a war that has united the Greeks, as the catalogue in the second book indicates" (p. 648).3 Hence it is not surprising that a patriot like Carnoes should find expressed in the Homeric poems a kind of broad cultural unity which had acquired throughout cen turies marked by continuing political evolution many aspects of collectivity in the national sense. Homer, however, was only one of Carnoes' principal models. Vergil, whom he follows more directly, states with greater cla rity the element of nationalism, and partially follows, in his turn, the path already marked by Naevius and Ennius. The importance of Vergil's nationalism to Carnoes is not merely its existence, however, but the emphasis which it receives. It be comes, in the Aeneid, a kind of purpose of its own. What Crum calls the "grand design" of the greatness of Rome (p. 649) is in reality much more than that. As Charles Cochrane points out, "Vergil provided inspiration and direction to Augustus* im perial programme of reconstruction, thereby earning a position among the architects of empire hardly less significant than that of the Caesars themselves. This, however, was but the begin ning of his influence. For, through the magnetic attraction exercised by his works, he impressed indelibly upon posterity his sense of the mission of Eternal Rome. By thus projecting into the consciousness of mankind his vision of the commonwealth, he offered a basis for imperial solidarity throughout successive generations..."4 Seen in this light, and despite the growing opinion that Vergil's faith may well have been in Rome her self and not in the man Augustus, the Aeneid is plainly nation alistic in the collective and pragmatic sense; as such, perhaps more than in any other way, it is the archetype behind Os Lu siadas. Carnoes, like Vergil, wrote of his country with a specific end in mind. Aubrey Bell is correct in saying that he sought 3. The disjointing of the Greek "nation" as it appears in the host before Troy through the dispersal and death of the heroes in the Odyssey serves to reinforce the nationalistic element of the earlier work since, had there been no "nation", there could have been no disjointing. The Greeks, mo reover, are but one of the warring parties in the Iliad. The Trojans in a sense already were a nation and needed no drawing together. The ease 'with which Hector becomes a symbol for patriotism must also have been apparent to Cam?es. 4. Christianity and Classical Culture (New York, 1957), pp. 28-29.</page><page sequence="3">63 to chronicle the deeds of the Portuguese,5 but it should be added that he did so pragmatically, and that he thereby demonstrates his basic concept of the epic to be classical in the Vergilian sense. To be sure, Vergil wrote during a time when the burgeon in optimism of the Augustan settlement needed merely to be shaped, while Cam?es, writing at a time when Portuguese as cendency had already waned severely, was attempting to re create the spirit which had engendered that ascendency. The fact that he failed where Vergil succeeded, however, and that the circumstances he faced were vastly different, does not obscure the other and more pertinent fact that he conceived of the epic in fundamentally the same terms as did his Roman model of fifteen-hundred years before. There are, of course, many points of contact between Os Lu stadas and the classics other than what may be termed Cam?es* point of view with regard to epic purpose. One of the most apparent of these is the mythos out of which the story, although net fabricated, is enriched, and the use of which has provided more subjects for discussion than perhaps any other feature of the poem. By "mythos" is here meant that body of "mythical versions of religion, history, and folk-lore, relics of real rites now inexpli cable or misunderstood, and creations of fancy and fiction../* all of which have been given by various poets and bards "the distinction and authority which come from being presented with a high style and a sense of heroic grandeur"6 and which form in large part man's cultural tradition.7 Clearly, because of the intervening centuries, it could not be the same for Cam?es as it was for his ancient models, despite the common appearance of many figures, but the difference is one of quantity only. Mythos is by its very nature organic and the fact that it en larges itself with time has no bearing upon the process of the poet's drawing from it for his own artistic needs. Moreover, Vergil's mythos differed from Homer's in the same way and for the same reasons, although not to the same extent, that Cam?es* did, New elements had simply agglomerated to it over 5. Portuguese Literature (Oxford, 1922), pp. 180481. 6. C. M. Bowra ? The Greek Experience (New York, 1959), pp. 119420. 7. It is not intended in this study to define so large a topic as myth itself; this has already been done superbly by Bowra ( The Greek Experience, pp. 115ff.) and his definition is the one referred to here.</page><page sequence="4">64 the years.8 He drew, for instance, upon Homer himself; there fore Carnoes, in drawing upon Vergil, is following an established pattern of obtaining source material. Carnoes had many other fonts, however, which were not in the least classical. He used the Carolingian cycle, for example, and was familiar with the Cantar de m?o Cid, Orlando Furioso and, of course, the Bible. Yet his use of these seemingly disparate elements fits the clas sical pattern because they had agglomerated to his mythos in the same way that Homer had to Vergil's or, for that matter, to Ovid's. It has been maintained that Carnoes' use of mythos is palpably different from Homer's or Vergil's because it is not the source of his narrative but rather only of artistic embellishment. Such a contention, despite a modicum of superficial truth, is pointless. Although it is not the purpose here to discuss Schliemann's dis coveries in Asia Minor, the degree to which the ancients did or did not attribute factual truth to their myths, or the importance to Vergil of the real battle of Actium, it is the purpose to em phasize the fact that, at Carnoes' time, da Gama's voyage fell sui generis within the limits of a clearly defined and well esta blished literary form which was itself inextricably bound up in mythos. The Portuguese epic had been lived, but it had been lived as such precisely because of the form with which it coin cided so well. If it and the voyages of Odysseus, Jason and Aeneas are reduced to the barest of narrative facts, they become no more than lengthy journeys by ship in the face of incredible hardships and distinguishable one from another only in terms of geography and such incidentals as weapons and navigational instruments. The birth in real happenings of Carnoes' saga, then, although providing it with an immediacy which could not have come from a tale of bygone ages, does not cause it to differ qualitatively from its classical antecedents. Indeed, Vergil's des cription of Actium sets a precedent for the use of actual histo rical events, and provides Carnoes with the pattern for elevating certain aspects of the real above the ordinary by fusing them with the mythical. The battle is depicted on the boss of the shield which Vulcan made for Aeneas (Book VIII) and is sur rounded by two concentric circles of designs. In the outer circle are four lucky escapes of the Roman monarchy, in the inner one four escapes of the republic. Aeneas, the mythical founder 8. Bell accurately states that "we find Cam?es gathering his material from all sides like a bird in spring. . ." (Portuguese Literature, p. 180). He makes no mention of an organic mythos, however.</page><page sequence="5">65 of the Julian gens, bears the shield away. As he does so he is clearly identified with Augustus, the real founder of the empire.9 Hence it is only logical for Cam?es to consider Actium and other deeds of valor, whether of Romans, Greeks or such Old Testa ment figures as David, merely as more veracious happenings in the same heroic continuum which, beginning with Homer, ex tended in an unbroken line until it embraced not only the great Portuguese mariners but also such other national heroes as Afonso Henriques, Egas Moniz, Nun' Alvares Pereira, etc. Cam?es was not alone in his awareness of Portugal's place within the heroic continuum. For over a generation the entire nation had been waiting for someone to put their already realized epic into its proper literary perspective and thereby immortalize it. Joao de Barros D?cadas afford many examples of such a collec tive frame of mind; one of the best is his comparison of da Gama's voyage to those of the Greeks.10 The former crossed "mares nunca d'antes navegados," far from sight of land, while the latter hugged the coast line and had lunch in one cove, dinner in the next. But the latter, fictitious or not, were nevertheless heroes whose fame was both as alive to Renaissance humanists as it had been to audiences in the Grecian city states and was also the yardstick by which all subsequent voyages were judged. Hence the Portuguese in the sixteenth century could not very well see their achievements as other than epic, and it fell to Cam?es to synthesize for posterity their views. This he did by consciously extending his traditional mythos so that it compre hended da Gama's expedition geographically and aesthetically as well as in the coincidence of basic narrative fact. His most obvius technique, and perhaps the one most frequently discussed, is the use of Graeco-Roman deities to explain certain happenings en route to India. Another somewhat less talked-about method is his rooting of the actual enterprise in a dream of D. Manuel. A third way is his careful extension of the classical locus of the epic i.e. the Mediterranean world to include the new discoveries. The last two of these procedures have much in common, and it would be well to investigate them first, dealing subsequently with the poet's complex use of the pantheon. 9. The writer is indebted for this point and for much valuable counsel, advice and encouragement to Professor Paul MacKendrick of the Department of Classics at the University of Wisconsin. 10. Asia, D?cada I, livro IV, "O Descobrimento da India," ed. Rodrigues Lapa (Lisbon, 1955), p. 99.</page><page sequence="6">66 Much has been said about the parallels which dreams afford between Os Lusiadas and its ancient models. Hern?ni Cidade discusses Carnoes' superior understanding and use of psychology as reflected in that of D. Manuel.11 It would seem, however, that little consideration has been given to the fact that a voyage of itself epic in the narrative sense takes a further step toward becoming epic in the aesthetic sense when it is given the proper origin. Vasco da Gama was summoned by the king to set out on his venture as a direct result of the council which, in its turn, resulted from the royal dream (Os Lusiadas, IV, 46). Although Manuel's vision of the Indus brings to mind the Tiber's appear ance to Aeneas (Aeneid, Book VIII), the subsequent council and decision to act based upon the dream recall more nearly the situation brought about by Agamemnon's dream in the Iliad (Book II).12 Carnoes' intention, then, is clearly to make the voyage epic in conception as well as in realization, and the closeness with which he follows his models demonstrates to a large extent how successful he was in doing so. Since he is no mere imitator, and since there is nonetheless no significant formal difference between his presentation of the dream and either Homer's or Vergil's, he obviously achieves his purpose. It is, of course, necessary to interpret allegorically the appearance of the Indus, but, as will appear later, such an interpretation need not be considered an innovation. Once the voyage had been conceived in classical terms, there remained to create for it the proper setting. All previous epics had taken place in a world not only limited but also largely sacrosanct. The Mediterranean, beyond being the scene of Odys seus' and Aeneas' travels, was the milieu of the epic. Emanating from its civilizations and bound up in them was the entire mythos of classical antiquity and most of that of Renaissance Humanism. Its very waters had given birth to the most important pagan di vinity to appear in Os Lusiadas; its islands and shores were characterized by a mystique and an aura of the supernatural not to be encountered elsewhere. Hence, since da Gama's route lay across new and different seas, the Mediterranean's atmosphere had to be extended to cover these as well, and Carnoes accord ingly extended it. 11. Lu?s de Cam?es, 2^ ed. (Lisbon, 1953), p. 33. 12. Zeus sent Agamemnon a dream telling him to arm the host for Troy could be taken. The king awoke, summoned his heralds, and called a council beside Nestor's ship. The result of the- debate which ensued was battle with the Trojans, although the city was not taken, and Menelaos' duel with Paris.</page><page sequence="7">67 In the first place, despite the close geographic confinement which, in Renaissance eyes, the Mediterranean imposed upon the an cient mariners, there is the ring of far-away, exotic places to their tales. The name of Colchis, isolated and barbaric, must have had an exciting sound to Greek audiences. Cam?es, aware of this sound, takes advantage of it in the fourth line of his poem when he says that the Portuguese "Passaram ainda al?m da Ta probana" (I, 1). To be sure, Taprobana (Ceylon) is scarcely an island in the Mediterranean, but Cam?es is interested here only in the sound itself and its powers of stimulation. When his interest in any given location is for its own sake and its relationship to his narrative, he carefully fits it into the classical picture. Hence one of the Hindu idols at Calecute reminds him of Jupiter Ammon in Libya (VII, 48) and even the imaginary Ilha dos Amores is provided with comparisons relating it to va rious classical /oc?. Its tape?aria, for example, is better than that of Aquem?nia (IX, 60). The best illustration of this process is afforded by the description of the island of Madeira: Mas, nem por ser do mundo a derradeira, Se lhe avantajam quanfas Venus ama; Antes, sendo esta sua, se esquecera De Cipro, Gnido, Pafos e Citera. (V, 5) Venus would have preferred Madeira to her Grecian archipelago not because it is new and different, but because it possesses to a greater extent the same qualities. This sort of geographical expansion of the classical milieu is not limited to the voyage itself, however. It is also employed to give the proper frame of reference to the whole great surge of national achievement which culminated in the discovery of India. Hence, when da Gama describes the expeditions of Pero de Covilh? to the xeque of Melinde, he makes that intrepid traveller the lineal descendent of of one of Rome's most successful expansionist emperors: Dali v?o em demanda da agua pura (Que causa inda ser? de larga historia) Do Indo, pelas ondas do Oc?ano, Onde n?o se atreveu passar Trajano. (IV, 64) As a result of this technique, the deeds of the discoverers are seen not only within the correct sphere of reference but also against a background of heroic accomplishment which was known to be real. Trajan represents an actual historical expansion of the Mediterranean world beyond the boundaries of the sea itself,</page><page sequence="8">68 and thereby provides Carnoes with ample precedent for a similar expansion. Trajan was by definition a part of the classical cul ture known to the humanists. As such, he took the locus of that culture with him wherever he went. It has been seen that Carnoes, centuries later, set about doing the same thing artisti cally. The poetic aggrandizement of the locus classicus could not be realized by conquest alone. The equation of new places with old, and even the establishment of a continuum in which new deeds are seen with relationship to old, were not of themselves enough to recreate the entire world of the ancient epic. The framework had been established in terms both of action and of place, but there remained the need to recreate as well the Me diterranean aura of mysteriousness. The newly expanded world had to be peopled with all the various supernatural beings-nymphs, giants, gods and goddesses-which filled the pages of Carnoes' models. The obvious way to people it was to employ the pan theon. Carnoes has already been seen to do this for geographical purposes in his treatment of Madeira. One of his purposes there was obviously to make it possible for the old gods to feel at home in new places and to harmonize with them. He was aided in his task by the fact that the Bacchus legend had already attached itself to India and by the inescapable inference that such ancients as Trajan and Alexander undoubtedly took their gods-z.e. much of Carnoes* mythos-with them at least as far as the Indus.13 The traditional divinities, however, were not sufficient for his purposes. Just as Vergil needed an artistic solution for the pro blem of what to do with Aeneas' fleet and consequently turned the ships into nymphs, thereby enriching mythology by the crea tion of new member beings (Book IX), so Carnoes, faced by the necessity to resolve artistically the problems presented by the storms at the Cape of Good Hope, created the giant, Adamas tor. In the simple act of doing so he was plainly taking a license which Vergil had established as permissible. Moreover, his problem itself was similar to Vergil's in that he could not employ any of the extant beings. Vergil could not turn the ships into any of the familiar nymphs, since these already had both known origins and given functions. Likewise Carnoes could not recruit for his personified cape any of the giants already metamor phosed, such as Atlas, since these were literally rooted to one 13. See e.g. the description of Alexander in the relief on the wall of the Samorim's palace (VII, 54).</page><page sequence="9">69 spot and unable to move, as Venus could, to greener pastures elsewhere. With the Vergilian answer to the situation in mind, however, Cam?es drew upon his mythos with great discrimination and created a new giant who is, in everything but the date of his birth, a classical figure. It is not intended here to discuss at any length the sources of Adamastor. As Hern?ni Cidade correctly points out, "Cam?es n?o precisava, para conceber ideia t?o comum. . . de mais do que da vaga sugest?o do gigante Polifemo, do gigante Atlas, metamorfoseado em monte, ambos da Odisseia, conjugada com a sugest?o das lendas de sombras de mortos, anunciando acon tecimentos faustos ou infaustos" (Lu?s de Cam?es, p. 34). It would seem worthwhile to add, however, that Adamastor's par ticipation in the war with Olympus (V, 51), and his love for Thetis (V, 53) so highly reminiscent of Ovid's tale of Poly phemus and Galatea in both its narrative composition and its eroticism,14 attest to the successs with which Cam?es achieved his purpose of recreating the mystique of the locus classicus in areas where the nature of his mythos prevented him from ex tending it by either simple comparison or the bodily transferral of its inhabitants.15 Adamastor has been called Cam?es' only original contribution to classical mythology. In point of fact, such a statement is obviously fallacious unless anthropomorphic beings alone may be considered. The Ilha dos Amores is an equally original crea tion, a fact not to be disputed on the irrelevant grounds that it is a place instead of a person. To be sure, it is peopled with traditional divinities, but it emanates from the poet's imagination for a definite artistic purpose, once again in the manner of Ver gil's nymphs. Its roots are planted firmly in a mythos which comprehends the love goddess' birth from the waves, her predi lection for islands in general, and, perhaps, such specifically 14. It is worthy of note that Polyphemus hurled a mountain at Galatea's lover, Acis, and buried him. In Carnoes' version it is the giant himself who is metamorphosed, but the parallel is nonetheless apparent. 15. Bowra states that Adamastor's "character and appearance come largely from chivalrous epic and through it from fairytale" (From Virgil to Milton [London, 1957], p. 124). Although Carnoes was obviously acquainted with chivalrous epic, the classical associations of Adamastor, which Bowra himself mentions (ibid., pp. 125-126), indicate that the giant's birth was also classical rather than medieval. The parallel between his metamorphosis into a feature of the landscape and Atlas' similar fate seems to substantiate this point.</page><page sequence="10">70 vague islands as the floating one of Aeolus. Like Adamastor, it has enough antecedents to make it, except for the date of its emergence, an integral part of the classical whole; but, again like the giant of the Cape, it owes its existence to a Portuguese Poet of the Renaissance. Mention of the Ilha dos Amores in conjunction with such deities as Venus and Thetis brings the mind to bear upon the entire complicated structure Cam?es rears out of the pantheon. In order to understand that structure, it is first necessary to point out that the traditional explanation of it is incomplete. Its fun ction, as has been repeated ad nauseam, is unquestionably that of expressing poetically certain happenings and of magnifying generally the scope of the narrative. The precise reason for such repetition, however, is somewhat obscure, since the original state ment is made by the poet himself, who also explains with great clarity that the Ilha dos Amores is an allegory. "Aqui, s? verdadeiros, gloriosos Divos est?o, porque eu, Saturno e Jano, J?piter, Juno, fomos fabulosos, Fingidos de mortal e ceg? enga?o. S? para fazer versos deleitosos Servimos; e, se mais o trato humano Nos pode dar, ? s? que o nome nosso Nestas estrilas pos o engenho vosso. "E tamb?m, porque a Santa Providencia, Quem em J?piter aqui se representa, Por esp?ritos mil que tem prudencia Governa o Mundo todo que sustenta... [X, 82, 83) Que as Ninfas do Oc?ano, t?o formosas, T?tis e a ilha ang?lica pintada, Outra cousa n?o ? que as deleitosas Honras que a vida fazem sublimada... Que as imortalidades que fing?a A antiguidade, que os ilustres ama, La no estelante Olimpo, a quem sub?a Sobre as asas ?nclitas da Fama, Por obras valerosas que fazia, Pelo trabalho imenso que se chama Caminho da virtude, alto e fragoso, Mas, no fim, doce, alegre e deleitoso:</page><page sequence="11">71 N?o eram sen?o premios que reparte, Por feitos imortais e soberanos, O mundo co'os varoes que esf?r?o e arte Divinos os fizeram, sendo humanos. Que J?piter, Mercurio, Febo e Marte, En?ias e Quirino e os dois Tebanos, Ceres, Palas e Juno com Diana, Todos foram de ?raca carne humana. (IX, 89, 90, 91). Carnoes naturally does not proceed to analyze these statements, for it was not his job to dissect for posterity his own creation. In like manner, it is not the job of the critic merely to repeat what the poet has already said far more eloquently. In short, the simple function of the pagan gods is not sufficient expla nation of their presence. Unless they are carefully integrated with the rest of the work, they become a kind of deus ex machina inherently at odds with the over-arching Christian nature and purpose. Furthermore, to claim that they are simply part of the impedimenta expected of a Renaissance epic is to ignore the sub tlety with which they are employed for various specific purposes and to overlook the painstaking care with which Carnoes worked them into his poem. For Carnoes unquestionably did integrate them, although his formula for doing so is an intricate one. One key to the pantheistic structure within a Christian poem such as Os Lusiadas lies, as Hern?ni Cidade points out (Luis de Cam?es, p. 39 ), in Carnoes* continuation of the medieval tradition, systematized in the Iberian Peninsula by St. Isidore of Seville, whereby the works of pagan authors could be inter preted to express allegorically the will of God. As has been demonstrated, the poet himself places that key in plain sight, and it provides perfectly adequate integration for the god Jupiter insofar as his role of Divine Providence extends. Such passages as the following, however, give evidence that it extends much farther; (the references are to Jupiter and Venus): As l?grimas lhe alimpa e, acendido, Na [ace a beija e abraca o col? puro. De modo que dali, se s? se achara, Outro novo Cupido se gerara. (II, 42). Even allowing for the strain of eroticism injected into Chris tianity by the Song of Songs and so highly developed in the mysticism of Cam?es* great Spanish contemporary San Juan de la Cruz, it is hardly possible to equate such a lecherous, wench ing father of the gods with Divine Providence. It is readily</page><page sequence="12">72 apparent, then, that at least Jupiter exists on more than one level, and that, for the second, some other method of integration must be found. It is of course true that Cam?es' great lyric flights, which are frequently erotic, are facilitated in the majority of cases by his use of the gods. This, however, is but one more statement of their function. The search for Cam?es' other method of integration must, like the first, begin with the allegorical interpretation of the myths. Unlike the first, it is not a product of the Christian Middle Ages but rather comes to him more or less directly from his classical models. As E. V. Rieu points out in the introduction to his translation of the Odyssey,16 "there are moments when we are at a loss to say whether the poet means us to imagine her [Athene's] actual presence or to understand only that his cha racters are exercising the mother-wit which she personifies." Cam?es, clearly, not only accepted the latter alternative but used it himself. The best way to observe how he does so is to begin not with the first appearance of a pagan god in the poem but with that god whose appearance engendered the narrative around which the poem is built ? the personification of the Indus in D. Manuel's dream. It is to be assumed that D, Manuel was a good Christian; had he not been, Cam?es would doubtless have refrained from some of the protestations of national faith which he sprinkles liberally throughout the work. Hence his dream is no more than the allegorical expression of forthcoming Portuguese domination in the East. Such an interpretation offers no particular difficulties, and is presented here because it provides a pattern not only for judging the appearance of Mercury to da Gama in yet another dream, but also because it helps to clarify some of the less trans parent acts by various other Olympians. In the first place, da Gama's dream is structurally almost an exact parallel of D. Manuel's: a god appears, imparts certain information, and the result is a specific action. Moreover, just as the Indus was particularly appropriate to a vision of empire in the East, so is Mercury, the classical patron deity of tra vellers, appropriate to the voyaging da Gama. He not only tells the captain to go to Melinde, however, but himself goes to that city as well, taking the goddess Fame with him, so that a welcome will be prepared for the fleet. Literal interpretation here is as 16. Odyssey, trans. E. V. Rieu (Edinburgh, 1957), p. 17.</page><page sequence="13">73 obviously impossible as it was in the case of D. Manuel and the Indus, and a figurative rendering is necessary. Unlike the former dream, however, and despite the structural similarities between the two, the latter demands more than the mere equa tion of Mercury with a sailor's vision of a much needed port, apt though this may be. Mercury's actions did not have refe rence only to da Gama, but included Melinde as well. Con sequently, the dream becomes part of a larger scheme in which the expectations of the Melindanos also participate. Since it has already been seen how Jupiter may be read as Divine Pro vidence, since it was Jupiter who dispatched Mercury on the errand, and since Carnoes undoubtedly did believe that the fleet enjoyed Heavenly protection, it is entirely logical to view the whole episode as an example of Almighty intervention. Bowra states emphatically that "if Jupiter is Divine Providence and God v/orks through second causes, Carnoes' gods and goddesses are neither fictions nor allegories nor famous men and women of the past but celestial powers who in their several spheres carry out the commands and will of the Supreme Being. They are aspects of Him and their powers are His" (From Virgil to Milton, p. 119). There is, after all, no reason why an allegorical Divine Providence should not itself act allegorically. In fact, remem bering Carnoes' continuation of the traditional medieval method of interpreting pagan works, there is every reason why it should. Viewed in this light, moreover, it provides clarification of what is perhaps one of the most complex uses of the pantheon in Os Lusiadas ? Venus' answer to da Gama's prayer during the storm (VI, 80ff.). Alarmed by the violence of the elements, the cap tain prays to God for help, as a good Christian should: "Divina Guarda, ang?lica, celeste, Que os Cens, o Mar c Terra senhoreias: Tu, que a todo Israel refugio deste Por metade das aguas Eritr?ias; Tu, que livtaste Paulo e defendeste Das Sirtes arenosas e ondas feias, E guardaste, co'os filhos, o segundo Povoador do alagado e vacuo mundo: "Se tenho novos m?dos perigosos Doutra Sila e Car?bdis j? passados, Outras Sirtes e baixo arenosos, Outros Acrocer?unios infamados, No lim de tantos casos trabalhosos. Porque somos de ti desamparados, Se ?ste nosso trabalho nao te ofende, Mas antes teu servi?o s? pretende? (VI. SI, S2). 6</page><page sequence="14">74 His prayer is heard, however, by Venus: Mas j? a amorosa Estrila cintilava Diante do Sol claro, no Horizonte, Mensageira do dia, e visitava A terra e o largo mar, com leda fronte. A Deusa que nos C?us a govemava, De quem foge o ens?fero Oriente, Tanto que o mar e a cara armada vira, Tocada junto foi de medo e de ira. "Estas obras de Baco s?o, por certo", Disse; "mas n?o ser? que avante leve T?o da?ada ten?ao, que descoberto Me ser? sempre o mal a que se atreve. . ." (VI, 85, 86) Saved by the intervention of the goddess and her nymphs, he promptly gives his thanks, again as a good Christian should: Sofrer aqui n?o p?de o Gama mais, De ledo em ver que a terra se conhece: Os geolhos no ch?o, as m?os ao C?u, A merci grande a Deus agradeceu. As gra?as a Deus dava, e raz?o tinha, Que nao s?mente a terra ?he mostrava Que, com tanto temor, buscando vinha, Por quem tanto trabalho exprimentava, Mas via-se livrado, t?o asinha, Da morte, que no mar lhe aparelhava O vento duro, f?rvido e medonho, Como quem despertou de horrendo sonho. (VI, 93, 94). Da Gama's own orthodoxy, evident in his attitude toward God, need not be discussed, but it would be well to point out that the manner in which Cam?es handles what he himself doubtless considered Divine assistance is, like the appearance of Mercury treated above, nothing more than an elaborate working out of a typically medieval allegorical statement. Cam?es obviously knew, and was at liberty to expect his readers to remember, that Jupiter in his role of Divine Providence had already promised to protect the Portuguese: "Formosa filha minha, nao tem?is/ Perigo algum nos vossos lusitanos..." (II, 44). It must have seemed plain to the poet that his allegorical creation logically should act in the terms of its creation, that one allegory created for artistic reasons might reasonably be counted upon to beget another. Clearly, he did intend to use such beings as Venus and</page><page sequence="15">75 Jupiter to "explain poetically certain happenings;" equally clearly, he realized part of his intention within the bounds of an esta blished Christian tradition. It has been seen, however, despite Bowra's emphatic statement, that, by no means all of Cam?es' allegories are Christian. D. Manuel's dream was merely the figurative foreshadowing of Portuguese greatness. Like it, the second level upon which such gods as Jupiter exist comes to the poet directly from his classical sources. This level is none theless not at odds with the Christian one, for it is either a simple allegory in the classical terms imposed by the epic form and integrated into the rest of the work by the permissible me taphorical explication of the ancient texts, or it is the poet's own development of certain basic ideas which, in their irreducible nuclear form, appear as typical Renaissance conceits. One good example of such a development is offered by the manner in which the fleet is turned back from Momba?a by Venus and the nymphs (II, 15ff.). In order to examine it properly, however, Venus' role must first be reduced to the simplest terms. In any poem dating from Cam?es' time, conceits may be ex pected to abound, and Os Lus?adas is no exception. Not sur prisingly, given the warlike nature of heroic verse in general, many of them involve Mars. Any number of these could be cited, but only one is necessary, and that which closes the following half -strophe has been chosen because of its conciseness; (the subject of the action is D, Afonso III): Da terra dos Algarves, que ?he fora Em casamento dada, grande parte Recupera co'o bra?o, e deita fora O Momo, mal querido j? de Marte. (Ill, 95). The meaning of this line is obviously that the Moor is no longer as skillful or as fortunate at warfare as he once was. A parallel hendecasyllable can easily be constructed for Venus and the Por tuguese without violating the aesthetic continuity of the poem: O Portugu?s querido de Dione. To fathom the meaning here it is necessary only to remember that Venus came to Cam?es as the specific patron deity of epic voyages straight from the Aeneid, his closest model. Hence the figure is easily rendered as ''the Portuguese skillful or fortunate at voyaging" and is the nucleus around which such imagery as the following is built:</page><page sequence="16">76 P?e~se a Deusa com outras em direito Da proa capitaina, e ali fechando O caminho da barra, est?o de jeito Que em v?o assopra o vento, a vela inchando. Poem no madeiro duro o brando peito, Para detr?s a forte ?au for?ando; Outras em derredor levando-a estavam, E da barra inimiga a desviavam. (II, 22) The general idea of the fleet's good fortune is here applied to a given incident and developed in terms of action which har monize with the basic poetic statement as it appears in the con ceit postulated above. Regarded thus, much of the activity by the various pagan gods in Os Lusiadas is readily observed to emanate from the rhetorical conventions of Humanism. Because those conventions have nothing whatsoever to do with Chris tianity one way or another, such activity is not a dens ex machina and is not at odds with the purpose of the poem. There are gods other than Venus who are also best understood in the same way, and the principal of these is Bacchus. If a conceit like the one involving Venus were posited for Bac chus, something on this order would result: O filho de Luso que Baco odeia. Bearing in mind the role played by Bacchus, such a phrase becomes the minimal expression of the difficulties faced by the voyagers. It means, simply, "the Portuguese who underwent hardships on their way to India." Just like the con cept of Lusus as the sire of the Portuguese, the god and his hatred are pure rhetoric. If Carnoes' creative process is recons tructed on such a base, however, it becomes only logical for the difficulties presented as hatred to manifest themselves in terms of action through Bacchus' efforts to destroy the fleet. It also becomes apparent what some of the inner workings of Carnoes descriptive technique are. In short, he draws upon his mythos for the organic enlargement of certain basic units of thought most succinctly articulated as conceits, and also, as demonstrated previously, for the purpose of making allegorical statements which either may or may not cloak a Christian point of view, depending upon his needs at the moment. It is, of course, necessary to follow Carnoes as he shifts from one level of allegory to another, often, as is the case with Jupiter, using the same figure in more than one way. To do so is not difficult, however, since the line of demarcation between levels is distinct. Por example, the Jupiter who lusts after Venus could not possibly be Divine Providence, and there</page><page sequence="17">77 is no danger of mistaking him as such. Moreover, the fact that it is impossible to assign a single, exact value to each of the figures throughout the poem, thereby enabling the critic to analyze them with mathematical precision, in no way impairs a work four centuries have declared immortal. After all, it is not necessary for every line of a Christian poem to cloak a message of orthodoxy. This is especially true when even the most ardent Christians -? and Cam?es himself is an excellent example ? were imbued with the neo-paganism of the Renais sance. Cam?es love for the pagan world in no way affected his own religious faith, just as the various levels on which the pagan deities of Os Lus?adas exist in no way affect one another. Although the composition of Cam?es pantheon has now largely been described, there remains the necessity of examining how certain aspects of it bear specifically upon his concept of the epic as a whole. His pragmatic view of epic purpose has already been treated, but it cannot be doubted that he thought of his work as an end in itself as well. It was to him nothing less than the immortalization of its content, the actual achieve ment of an afterlife in terms of fame. Such an attitude is not surprising when it is remembered how widespread during the sixteenth century was the idea that verses made their subject live on long after the flesh itself was gone. No better example could be found to attest its dissemination than the famous sonnet One Day I Wrote Her Name of the poet's younger English contemporary, Edmund Spenser. The last two quartets of this lyric provide a brief and accurate statement of the general outlook: "Vain man/' said she, "that dost in vain essay A mortal thing so to immortalize; For I myself shall like to this decay, And eke my name be wiped out likewise." "Not so," quoth I; "let baser things devise To die in dust, but you shall live by fame; My verse your virtues rare shall eternize, And in the heavens write your glorious name. . . "17 In the second stanza of Os Lus?adas Cam?es phrases his purpose in much the same way: 17. A Little Treasury of Great Poetry, ed. Oscar Williams (New York, 1947), p. 345.</page><page sequence="18">78 E aqueles que por obras valerosas Se v?o da lei da Morte libertando: Cantando espalharei por toda parte, Se a tanto me ajudar o engenho e arte. (I, 2) Spenser's love lyric naturally does not include the "obras vale rosas" of Carnoes' epic, but the concept of the poet's being the architect of immortality is clearly common to both works. The suject in each case must, moreover, provide the poet with a foundation upon which to build. Although it would be a mistake to equate Camonian and Spenserian virtue, there are certain qualities of Spenser's beloved ? beauty of soul as well as body ? which give him sufficient reason to eternize her. Likewise, Carnoes' heroes deserve eternization for what they themselves have done, and his job is to provide it. The marked similarities on the specific issue of fame between a Portuguese poet of the quinhentos and an English Elizabethan give ample grounds to consider their position essentially of their age, and so it is. In Carnoes' case, moreover, there is mixed with it another idea which persisted long after the euphoria of the High Renaissance had passed and which finds particularly lucid articulation in the baroque writer Juan de Mariana. It is that of virtue's being the road to fame. Because of Carnoes' own insistance upon this point (see e.g. his statement with regard to the Ilha dos Amores, supra, p. 70), it is of interest to look briefly at an example of Mariana's view as well; (the subject is Calder?n, who had recently died): Mas d?mos treguas ? quejas y gemidos, y t?, alma feliz, mu?venos a la contemplaci?n de tus virtudes. El verdadero fruto de la amistad, la verdadera honra, el verdadero amor consiste en conservar en el ?nimo tu memoria, en propagar con todas nuestras fuerzas tu fama y el recuerdo de las prendas de tu alma mas que las de tu cuerpo. Aunque moristes, vivir? la gloria de tus virtudes.18 Mariana adds that a monument, more perpetual than bronze if possible, should be erected to Calde?n. Although the great poet was certainly no soldier, he too, in his own way, will live on in a fame which has virtue at its base. 18. Obras, in B. A. E. (Madrid, 1845), Vol. XXXI, p. 558.</page><page sequence="19">79 Such Renaissance and even baroque characteristics do not obscure the fact that Cam?es' view of fame has its roots in the Graeco Roman epos. Indeed, his humanistic training helps to explain why this is so, for, no matter what the road to fame may be and no matter how much its realization may depend upon the poet, it is already in existence as a concept of and for itself in Homer. It is virtually the only and certainly the most important afterlife of the Achean hero, aricT Cam?es' awareness of this fact is demonstrated by his express recognition of the literary element within the classical technique of deifyng certain heroes whose fame, achieved through their deeds, raised them to the level of the immortals: Mas a Fama, trombeta de obras tais, Lhe deu no mundo nomes t?o estranhos De Deuses, Semideuses, Imortais, Indigetes, Heroicos e de Magnos. (IX, 92) Greek myth had deified Hercules, who, albeit the son of Zeus, was a mortal. Vergil, moreover, had synthesized the deification of Romulus and Aeneas. Cam?es, very naturally viewing the synthesis as the poet's work, held that the immortality enjoyed in his time by the ancient heroes, even though engendered by their own deeds of valor, was born of artistic creation and existed through the independent immortality of that creation. It cannot be denied that, without Homer and Vergil, the epic world of Humanism would have been vastly different. Other heroes would doubtless have come to replace Aeneas and Odysseus as the yardsticks by which maritime achievement was measured, but the simple fact that they would have been others reveals how dependent were those who did survive upon the authors who wrote of them. Hence it was virtually unavoidable for Cam?es to consider the epic as a kind of reality of its owTn, as the end product of the process whereby fame achieves exis tence. It is in this regard, then, that his pantheon must now be examined. It has already been witnessed how Cam?es thought of all the pagan gods in the same way (supra, p. 70), although he obviously felt at liberty to use them as they had come down to him in as many ways_ and for as many purposes as he saw fit. Those whose earliest appearance was on Mount Olympus were no different to him from those who were born mortal but later ascended the same peak. That this should be so follows logi cally from the combination of his inability as a Christian to</page><page sequence="20">80 consider them as anything higher than art and the fact that they existed for him in exactly the same way the heroes did, enjoying, for all the same reasons, an identical afterlife of fame. Consequently, if his statement that "Todos foram de fraca carne humana" is extended to read "Todos foram de fraca carne humana concebidos", the sense of the original is in no way violated and the meaning becomes abundantly clear. It is, simply, that all beings elevated above the ordinary, whether their specific designation be that of god, demigod, hero or whatever, owe their stature to the mortal poet in whose works they live. In this sense it is indeed the poet who conceives them, and he is therefore the "fraca carne humana" whence they stem. If further proof of this point is needed, it can be found in Carnoes' open assertion that the ancients themselves imagined their immortals: *'... as imortalidades que fing?a / A antiguidade. . ." (IX, 90). Whether or not they actually did so is irrelevant, for the fact remains that Carnoes thought they did and that, judging their works on a purely literary basis, he was right. In this connection it now becomes interesting to analyze certain aspects of his treatment of the two major clas sical gods in Os Lusiadas, Bacchus and Venus. Bacchus opposes the voyage of discovery from the outset because he is afraid it will dwarf his own glory. It is important to note, however, that his fear is not based specifically upon the deeds which the Portuguese will perform, but rather upon the fact that those deeds will come to replace his own as the subject of heroic verse, the stuff of epics: Ve [Baco] que j? teve o Indo subjugado, E nunca lhe tirou Fortuna ou caso Por vencedor da India ser cantado De quantos bebem a agua de Parnaso. Teme agora que seja sepultado Seu t?o c?lebre nome em negro vaso De agua do esquecimento, se l? chegam Os fortes Portugueses que navegam. (I, 32) There is, then, a deeper level of meaning within Bacchus' obvious function, which is that of personifying a kind of resentment on the part of the ancient world at its eclipse in order to dramatize by contrast the Portuguese achievements. It is the magnification of the Portuguese heroes in the self-same terms of the pantheon but without recourse to the actual process of deification which would have been impossible to a Christian</page><page sequence="21">S? poet. Even had he so desired, Cam?es could not have made gods out of his mariners. In the first place the Inquisition would have prohibited him from doing so; in the second place it must be remembered that his narrative was based upon real happenings which involved real people, one of whom, da Gama, was his kinsman. Given his concept of the pagan divinities' origin and existence, however, he could and did integrate them into his work so that they became by their very nature a measure of Portuguese greatness. Bacchus' fear might almost be termed a fear for his life .? itself a poetic creation ? since he is faced with being ignored by poets in favor of the Portu guese. These, as a result of the attention now to be given to them, will not only attain the same level of fame which he had once occupied but, since he is to be ignored, will surpass him. Bacchus, however, represents only one aspect of Cam?es' tech nique in this particular application of the pantheon. The other is represented by Venus and is, because she favors the Portu guese as much as Bacchus opposed them, the converse of the first. Although the reasons behind Venus' taking the part of the explorers are known, it would be well to look at them briefly here: Sustentava contra He [Baco] Vinus hela, Afei?oada ? gente Lusitana, Por quantas qualidades via nela Da antiga, t?o amada sua, Romana; Nos fortes cora?oes, na grande estrila Que mostraram na terra Tingitana, E na lingua, na qual quando imagina, Com pouca corrup?ao cr? que ? a Latina. Estas causas moviam Citer?ia, E mais, porque das Parcas claro entende Que h? de ser celebrada a clara D?ia Onde a gente bel?gera se estende. Assim que, um pela infamia que arreceia, E o outro pelas honras que pretende, Debatem e na porf?a permanecem: A qualquer seus amigos favorecem. (I, 33, 34) Venus expects her own prestige to be increased by the Portu guese, then, and to be spread by them throughout their empire, However, since Cam?es obviously cannot be implying any literal extension of her worship, and since it has already been seen how one of her Olympian colleagues is in a sense to be replaced</page><page sequence="22">82 by the new heroes, his meaning may at first glance be somewhat obscure. Why should Venus benefit from the Portuguese deeds when it is known that those deeds will cause poets to magnify specifically the Portuguese themselves and not any classical figure? What new honors can she aspire to when the "bar?es assinalados" are the sole beneficiaries of Carnoes' effort to create an afterlife of fame? As an answer to such questions it has been suggested that, in light of the author's known eroticism, Venus may here be taken to stand for the amorous nature of his race and that the extension of her Worship means that the conquerors will practice their amours in whatever new lands they reach. This kind of analysis, although ingenious, is inherently at odds not only with the overall intention of the poem but also with its intrinsically heroic composition and therefore does not merit serious consideration. It cannot be denied that Os Lusiadas is often lyric and frequently erotic, but neither can it be denied that these qualities are incidental to the central purpose. Consequently, some other reply must be found for the questions which arise from Venus* contention, and the same strophes where this appears are the correct place to begin the search. The Portuguese remind Venus of her Romans. They are equally brave, their star is in the ascendant just as was that of Aeneas, and they virtually speak the same language. They are, in short, new Romans. As such, they will cause the goddess* fame to increase as a kind of logical corollary to their own. The Portuguese of the Renaissance were extremely conscious of their Roman heritage.19 Even Carnoes' statement that the language is only slightly corrupt Latin is by no means unique. Joao de Barros had already defended his mother tongue on the same grounds (Di?logo em louvor da nossa linguagem [1540] ),20 19. See Canto VI, strophe 7: "Via [Baco] estar o C?u determinado // De fazer de Lisboa nova Roma." 20. See Edwin B. William ? From Latin to Portuguese (Philadelphia, 1938), pp. 1546: This was the argument. . . of the "Dialogo em defensam da lingua portuguesa" of Pedro de Magalh?es de Gandavo, which appeared in 1574, four years before Henri Estienne's "Dialogue" against the italianisants. The argument was continued and elaborated in the following century in many books and treatises, the most notable of which was the "Breves louvores da lingua portuguesa: com notaveis exemplos da muita semelhan?a que tem com a lingua latina" of Alvaro Ferreira de Vera, published in 1631.</page><page sequence="23">83 and Cam?es himself was a known latinizer. Moreover, the many allusions to Roman history in Os Lus?adas, although performing in part the general function of providing an epic measuring rod and of extending the locus classicus, also serve to establish a contact with what was real in the world of Imperial Rome. Although by contrast they often demonstrate Portugal to be greater than Rome, they do not cause the Portu guese to differ so much from the Romans as they do to resemble them. Seen against this background of what might well be latter day Romanitas, Venus comes to personify the pride of that part of the ancient world which can find in the voyage of discovery and resultant imperium the continuation and expan sion of its own heroic achievements. Given the ever present greatness Humanism saw in Rome, such pride lifts the Portu guese to the highest possible level. Once again, then, Cam?es is using the pantheon to magnify his "bar?es assinalados" in its own terms without resorting to deification and without, in point of fact, giving one word of praise himself to the extant deities, including Venus. The greatest magnification of the heroes of Os Lus?adas, however, is to be found in the ninth Canto. The Ilha dos Amores is created by Venus, and to it any discussion of her role must inevitably lead. It has already been pointed out how Cam?es specifically states that the Ilha dos Amores is an allegory (supra, p. 70). It is also plainly an allegory of fame since it is the reward for "feitos grandes" and "ousadia forte e famosa." On yet a deeper level, it is the symbolic achievement of that immortality with which, in Cam?es' eyes, the ancient poets endowed their characters from Aeneas and Romulus to Jupiter himself. Within the framework of the pantheon of Os Lus?adas, it is the culmination of Bacchus' fears and Venus' hopes. Within the framework of the highly sensual imagery, which may have come directly from the Song of Songs, it is the mystic union of the mariners with the afterlife which Thetis and her nymphs represent. In short, Cam?es has employed a technique of Christian mysticism in order to marry his heroes to classical brides of fame who are in many ways artistically similar to San Juan de la Cruz's Bridegroom. The concept of expressing a kind of spiritual union through sexual, although it seems merely to have come from a common source, might well have been borrowed from the Saint had the occasion arisen and the opportunity been present. It is, moreover, as appropriate to Cam?es' ends as it was to San Juan's. The result of it here is that the poet is</page><page sequence="24">84 enabled to install da Gama and his crew firmly within the mythos of the pantheon without violating the essential Chris tianity of his poem and again without resorting to deification. The new heroes will live on not only in the same way their ancient ancestors did, but also in the same terms. Consequently, it would appear unnecessary to assume, as does Bowra, that "Carnoes seems to have had misgivings about its [the ilha dos amores'] appropriateness and even about its propriety" and that he explains it as an allegory in order to avoid shocking bigots at home (From Vergil to Milton, p. 129). Although most of the major uses to which Carnoes puts his pantheon have now been taken up, it has two remaining functions which merit examination. One of these is its employ ment for the digressions which are a fundamental characteristic of the ancient epic. Carnoes' cognizance of the fact that they are fundamental is attested by the frequency with which he himself digresses. He does not always confine himself to the pagan gods, of course; in fact he usually does not. He does deal with them upon occasion, however, and it would be well to point out that his interest in them for the sake of the stories they provide is not substantially different from Homer's. As Bowra states in The Greek Experience, the latter*s interest in. Hera's seduction of Zeus in the Iliad is for the sake of "the dramatic, amusing story, and nothing else" (p. 118). Bowra also underscores the fact that [the] primary myths were supplemented, and to some degree displaced, by other stories which were not strictly myths, since their main purpose was not to explain, but to delight. The more ancient tates of the gods, which arose from their rites and functions, provided a starting-point for many brilliant stories about them, which might indeed presuppose a ritual background or an aetiolo gical purpose, but left them behind in the new form which they received. (Ibid.) Consequently, when Carnoes dwells at some length upon Neptune's palace und the convocation of the sea gods in order to give rein to his descriptive powers, he is following the Homeric pattern of drawing upon his mythos purely for artistic effect. Homer was concerned with drama, Carnoes with des cription, but both sought to amuse and used a common method. Both also sought, of course, to slow down the action of their narratives through their digressions. Carnoes, moreover, vir</page><page sequence="25">85 tualiy states each of these purposes ? amusement and retarda tion of action -^ as he introduces the incident of the Doze de Inglaterra: "Com que melhor podemos (um ?izia) Este tempo passar, que ? t?o pesado, Sen?o com algum conto de alegr?a, Com que nos deixe o sono carregado?" (VI, 40) Time at sea does pass slowly, and could be especially "pesado" in the days of sail. Hence it was only natural for the sailors to amuse themselves by spinning yarns. The episode of the Doze de Inglaterra is, to be sure, of medieval Portuguese origin and not classical at all. Its presence and purpose have already been explained in classical terms, however, and to a certain extent the same may be done for its content. Despite its origin, it is of the same basically heroic nature which is also that of many ancient tales. Since it involves a tournament, perhaps it could best be likened to the wrestling match between Odysseus and Ajax or the mock duel between the latter and Diomedes in the Iliad (Book XXIII). Another parallel is suggested by the boxing match in the Aeneid between Entellus and Dares (Book V). It is not the same, to be sure, but it is the general kind of tale which, in all ages, agglomerates to the traditional mythos of a nation and provides material for the poet.21 Remembering, then, the organic composition of Carnoes' mythos in particular and the nationalistic nature of both his and the Graeco-Roman epic. Magri?o and the eleven other paladins become an eminently logical choice for a digres sion which, in all other regards, follows the classical rules exactly. The last major function of a pagan deity to be dealt with in this study comprehends Jupiter's role within the classical ritual of guest-friendship. Such a discussion is necessitated by the fact that Cam?es not only makes use or the ritual in order to cast much of his narrative in the epic mould but also because he adheres to it so closely. As a brief word of background, it should be noted that Homer's Zeus "watches over suppliants that deserve respect" (Odyssey, trans. E. V. Rieu, p. 116) 21. Proof of this is offered by the fact that Carnoes himself equates it with Carolingian legend, a recognized part of his mythos: "Pois pelos Doze Pares dar-vos quero // Os Doze de Inglaterra o seu Magrico" (I, 12).</page><page sequence="26">86 and that strangers come in his name (ibid., p. 216). Travellers are inviolate, and "it may have been because he had always lived by robbery and often murdered unsuspecting travellers. . ." that Sisyphus was punished.22 As Nausicaa makes plain to Odysseus, the outcast ? or traveller in need ? has a right to expect hospitality (Odyssey, p. 107). Furthermore, once the traveller has claimed the hospitality that is his right, he is to be treated with respect, as the Phaeacian elder Echenus makes plain by telling his king that "it is unseemly and unlike [his] royal ways to let a stranger sit in the dust at the hearth while [his other] guests... must patiently await [his] lead" (ibid., p. 116). The same emphasis on respect is repeated when Alcinous tells Odysseus, who has upbraided Euryalus for insul ting him, "My friend,.... we can take no exception to what you say" (ibid., p. 128). Once he has been received, the stranger is expected to reveal his identity and relate his adven tures, but not until after he has been wined and dined, as the case of Odysseus' soujourn in Phaeacia demonstrates. Turning, then to Os Lusiadas, it is found that the Portuguese came as suppliants to Melinde: they were seeking provisions and a pilot. The xeque received them graciously, sent a banquet to their ships,23 and treated them with all due respect. After they had dined and refreshed themselves, he requested da Gama to tell his story, and the captain did so. Festivities were arranged for the newcomers and are highly reminiscent of the Odyssey in that, in both cases, a display of strength is called for and provided. Just as Odysseus showed his prowess with the discus at the Phaeacian games, hinting at what could be expected from him if he were to be provoked, so the Portuguese gave the Melindanos a glimpse of their armada's firepower. Their performance differs from Odysseus' in not being that of one man but rather of many, but as such it is consonant with the collective nationalistic spirit of the epic which Carnoes inherited from Vergil. When the Portuguese left Melinde, the xeque sent a pilot with them, thus assuring them of passage to India. At this juncture the Odyssey again comes to mind. King Alcinous also assured his visitor of the passage he sought He did so in a different way, to be sure, but only with regard 22. Robert Graves ? The Greek Myths (Baltimore, 1959), Vol. I, p. 218. 23. Da Gama's refusal to set foot ashore was a fact imposed upon Cam?es by what actually took place but is of little consequence since it does not prevent the more important elements of the ritual from being observed.</page><page sequence="27">87 to incidentals, Odysseus needed a ship and da Gama did not. Odysseus was homeward bound, da Gama outward. Neither could have finished his journey without the help he received, however, and both owe their successful arrivals to their hosts. The general pattern is consequently the same in both cases. It can be seen, then, that in at least one important instance Cam?es has treated narrative fact which he gleaned from his own knowledge and such chroniclers as Jo?o de Barros, Gaspar Correia and Castanheda in terms nothing less than Homeric. Melinde was only one of the three important East African ports which the fleet visited, however, and its stops at the other two, Mo?ambique and Momba?a, are also handled within the scope of the guest-friendship ritual. That this is so is illustrated in two particular ways. Firstly, Momba?a and Mo?ambique violated the basic tenets of the ritual. The Portuguese came peacefully and as "suppliants" for water and provisions. Not only were they denied hospitality, however, which would have been a violation in itself, but their actual destruction was plotted and the entire ritual was thereby overthrown. Secondly, the Africans are to be punished for their failure to observe what amounted to an inviolable code: "Vereis a terra que a agua lhe tolhia Que inda h? de ser um porto mui decente, Em que v?o descansar da longa via As naus que navegarem do Octdente. Toda esta costa, enfim, que agora urd?a O mort?fero enga?o, obediente Lhe pagar? tributos, conhecendo N?o poder resistir ao Luso horrendo." (II, 48) It is important to note that Jupiter is speaking here. It is he who, as the specific deity of the ritual, promises vengeance upon those who failed to obey it. To be sure, the Fates had already decreed Portuguese dominance in Africa and he would have been powerless to gainsay them. Nevertheless, it is pro bable that Mo?ambique and Momba?a would have enjoyed the same relationship with Portugal Melinde did if they had behaved in the same way toward the explorers. Since they did not, Jupiter is acting very much in character by revealing what will become of them, and Cam?es is virtually stating his use of the ritual by have him do so. It is partially in this light, moreover, that the frequent use of the word "treachery" {enga?o) in</page><page sequence="28">88 conjunction with the East African Moors should be considered.24 The intended ambushes were, of course, treacherous in them selves, the more so because the Portuguese came in peace. Given also the centuries-old conflict between Christianity and islam, it is perfectly normal for one sworn enemy to phrase himself in such a way when speaking about the other. Never theless, seen against the background of a ritual which, by both its nature and its ultimate enforcement, takes on many of the aspects of a law, anything other than hospitality becomes treachery not only de facto but almost de [jure. Hence, although Carnoes uses the word more frequently than Homer does, he is not necessarily transgressing the classical canons in doing so. Furthermore, he had in Vergil a model for the employment of such terminology when dealing with a traditional enemy of his race: O my unhappy friends, you must be mad indeed. Do you really believe that your enemies have sailed away? Do you think that a Greek could offer a gift without treachery in it? 25 The similarity in point of view to Vergil with regard to a national enemy revealed in the language applied to the Moslems and the integration of that language into the guest-friendship ritual give evidence that Carnoes was consciously bringing to bear upon the single nationalistic theme of his own work the techniques of the classical epic as he understood it. Additional evidence is supplied by the essentially Portuguese character of most of his digressions. The Doze de Inglaterra, although an example here, are but a minor one, for the whole great pageant of national history, including the hapless Ines de Castro, is unfolded to the attentive xeque of Melinde. In just the same way the story of Troy was related to Dido by the wandering Aeneas. The frequent prophecies also, especially those at the Ilha dos Amores which describe Albuquerque and the other 24. Today enga?o normally means "deception, fraud; guile; deceit" (James L. Taylor ? A Portuguese-English Dictionary [Stanford, 1958] ). A stronger word is needed to convey Cam?es' meaning, however, and "trea chery," in the sense of "perfidious character or act" rather than in that of "violation of allegiance" seems more adequate ( Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary [Springfield, 1958]). Other words which Cam?es applies to the Moors?falsos, p?rfidos, nefandos^te-nd to reinforce this point. 25. Aeneid, trans. W. F. Jackson Knight (London, 1959), p. 52. The Latin word is dolus: "aut ulla putatis / / Dona carere dolis Danaum?" (Aeneid, II, 43-44). This approximates the Portuguese enga?o in the sense of "perfidy" or "guile."</page><page sequence="29">89 heroes who are to follow in da Gama's wake, although strictly classical in form,26 are thoroughly Lusitanian in content. It is not surprising, therefore, that there should be a nationalistic purpose behind Carnoes' use of such other elements of the ancient epic as the catalogue. It has already been pointed out how Ernest Crum cites the list of ships in the second book of the Iliad as proof that the Trojan war had, in effect, united the Greeks (supra, p. 62). He also stated how the Homeric poems were looked upon as national epics (supra, p. 61). It would of course be a mistake to think that Homer had any such pragmatic purpose as Vergil, but it was Vergil who, in this regard, shaped Carnoes. Consequently, when Carnoes considered Homero list of ships, it is only logical to assume that he, like Crum, read it as a statement of national unity. .Given now his attempt to recreate the spirit of Portu guese ascendency at a time when the empire was beginning to crumble, such a statement is at once seen to be of great use to him for it permits his articulation of Portuguese unity in terms of a classical epic device. As Crum indicates (p. 652), "one of the longest catalogues [in Os Lusiadas], containing over 200 stanzas (3, 20-143; 4, 1 -76), is that of the heroes, kings and leaders of the Portuguese, beginning with the mythical Luso (Lyso) and continuing on down to the time of Carnoes." This is also a digression, for it is part of da Gama's long speech to the xequ&gt;e of Melinde, but there is no reason why a catalogue should not appear in such a way; in fact, there is every reason why this one should, since it thereby affords Carnoes the opportunity to show how the voyage itself is the culmination of the long series of heroic events which are described. For although Crum arbitrarily ends the catalogue at stanza 76 of the fourth Canto with the council which results from D. Manuel's dream, stanza 77 deals with the choice of da Gama himself to command the expedition, which Bowra correctly points out to be "a turning point in the long heroic story" (From Virgil to Milton, p. 90). Moreover, by making the voyage the end product of a process which is related in story form to a foreign ruler in his own city, Carnoes achieves the artistic transferral of the spirit which had made a single, united nation of Portugal 26. It does not seem necessary here to do more than point out that prophecies of one kind or another are a part of the classical epic, and that Aeneas' visit to Anchises in the Underworld (Aeneid, Book VI) provides, as has often been stated, an example of a nationalistic one. 7</page><page sequence="30">90 to the voyage itself. Da Gama and his colleagues represent that spirit in Melinde, just as Afonso Henriques represented it in the fatherland, because they too are a part of it. If it is remembered at this juncture that Cam?es witnessed the fragmentation of the collective effort which had created the empire into the welter of conflicting, minor and ofterij petty atempts at personal aggrandizement that Fern?o Mendes Pinto also saw, it becomes clear why he emphasized national unity. Like many Portuguese patriots, he was aware that a tiny nation whose resources were spread out across the face of the earth and waters had to act collectively if it was to survive. Hence, having already made his country's greatest single achievement part of the mainstream of its nationhood, he set out to demons trate that the same motivating spirit was present at the climax of that achievement. This he also did by means of a catalogue. The high point of Cam?es* narrative, so far as the facts with which he worked are concerned, is the arrival of the fleet at Calecute. Because he was limited by those facts, he could not prove with any Homeric list of ships and chieftains that the journey's completion was the realization of a collective effort by all the Portuguese and one more event in a chain stretching back to Lusus in myth and Afonso Henriques in reality. He could do so symbolically, however, and this is the meaning and purpose of his catalogue of the fleet's banners (VIII, 1 ff. ). The heroes and kings who made Portugal a nation are united symbolically behind the voyage and present at its greatest moment. Hence the poet has artistically recreated their spirit in India just as he had done in Africa, and has used the same device drawn from his Graeco-Roman predecessors. Within Cam?es* longest catalogue there is another classical device at work to reinforce the element of nationalism. It is the harangue, and it too may well be borrowed straight from Homer.27 When Nun* Alvares Pereira upbraids the Portu guese nobles before Aljubarrota for not hastening to the defense of their country, he sounds much like the angry Agamemnon rebuking the Greek soldiery for retreating in front of Hector: 27. An equally satisfactory designation would be "exhortation." There are many examples throughout the Iliad, and it does not seem necessary to call attention to more than one of them.</page><page sequence="31">91 "Como? Da gente ilustre Portuguesa H? de haver quern refuse o patrio Marte? Como? Desta provincia, que princesa Foi das gentes na guerra em t?da parte, H? de sair quem negu? ter defesa? Quem negu? a f?, o amor, o esf?r?o e arte De Portugu?s, e por nenhum respeito O pr?pr?o Reino queira ver sujeito?" (IV, 15) Shame on you, Argives! A fine-looking lot of men but a disgrace to your looks! Where are your boasts now, those empty boasts in Lemnos, when we said we were such grand fellows? You could eat your plates of beef, and drink your tubs of wine, and boast away that one you would stand up to a hundred Trojans or two hundred, and now we are all together not worth one?Hector! who will soon burn our ships in one great blaze!:-8 Admittedly there are many dissimilarities between these two passages. In the first place, there are no tubs of wine or plates of beef in Nun' Alvares' speech, and there is no mention of, f?, or amor in Agamemnon's. These, however, are external to the central issue in both harangues which is patriotism. In each case a great national leader is exhorting his fellows to rise and defend their country's cause. Obviously Greece was not a naticn in the sense that Portugal was, but this too is irrelevant in light of the case which can be made for the Trojan war as a collective national effort. Although it cannot be pretended at this point that Carnoes* concept of the epic has been examined in its entirety, certain fundamental aspects have, and it is hoped that these may provide the basis for further and more exhaustive investigation along the same lines. It is submitted that at least a significant number of the poet's techniques are virtually indistinguishable from those of his Graeco-Roman preceptors and that they are applied to the development of the pragmatic, nationalistic theme of his work in the same way he understood them, with good reason, to have been applied by Vergil in particular and by Homer in general. It is also submitted that his conscious expansion of the classical world to coincide with the Portuguese voyages of discovery demonstrates his inability to conceive of an "epic's" transpiring outside the milieu imposed by the geographical limitations of the archetypes. This inability shows him not only to have been steeped in the atmosphere of that milieu, as is to be expected of a Renaissance humanist, but also 28. Iliad, trans. W. H. D. Rouse (New York, 1960), p. 96.</page><page sequence="32">92 to have been shaped by it to such an extent that it was in many respects as real for him as it was for those ancient poets who participated in its creation. Because he was a product of Humanism, it would be but voicing the obvious to say that Cam?es was in many ways a classical poet who lived in the sixteenth century. The fact that he was, however, gives the lie once and for all to any claim that Os Lus?adas is an epic of commerce, a mere chronicle of Portuguese deeds, or, for that matter, "urn punhado de verdades numa arma?ao de mentiras." Cam?es does not lie, both because he does not need to and because the ultimate truth he is seeking is the reality of a life after death in terms of the fame which undeniably heroic achievement deserves.29 It is submitted finally that Os Lus?adas 29. There is, to be sure, a certain disparity between the facts of the voyage as these appear in his narrative and the form they take in, for example, the Roteiro of Alvaro Velho. There are equal disparities among the accounts by Barros, Correia and Castanheda, however, and Carnoes was in no case under the obligation to relate everything that occured from the time the fleet left Lisbon until it arrived in India. It has been pointed out that he makes no mention of the mutiny which forced da Gama to throw overboard the navigational instruments and which well might have thwarted the purpose of the expedition had it not been throttled immediately and with a heavy hand. This is true, but the poet demonstrates elsewhere that he is not averse to relating instances of treachery or disobedience on the part of his countrymen. Dealing with the battle of Aljubarrota, he makes the following statement, referring to the brothers of Nun' Alvares Pereira: ? tu, Sert?rio, ? nobre Coriolano, Catilina e vos outros dos antigos Que contra vossas patrias com profano Cor?ceo, vos fizestes inimigos: Se la no Reino escuro de Sumano Receberdes grav?ssimos castigos, Dizei?he que tamb?m dos Portugueses Alguns traidores houve algumas v?zes. (IV, 33) Having already made one such admission, there was no reason why he should make another: he had already given testimony to his fundamental honesty. He gives additional testimony when he treats the conduct of Lopo Vaz de Sampaio (X, 56ff.) and when he goes so far as to censure Albuquerque himself for the execution of Rui (X, 45). Had he wished to make an issue of the mutiny, he could easily have done so in classical terms on the basis of the conduct of Odysseus' sailors when they opened the leather bag containing the contrary winds expressly against the orders o? their commander (Odyssey, Book X). His silence on the subject, then, is to be taken as that and nothing more. For reasons of his own he did not see fit to develop it, and, having already proved himself honest, he did not need to.</page><page sequence="33">93 does not in the least represent "a humaniza?ao dos deuses e a deifica?ao dos homens." Although the pantheon never exists on a higher plane than that of allegory, neither does it exist on a lower one. It has been seen how Cam?es takes a leaf from the book of mysticism to elevate his heroes to that specific level of fame enjoyed by the pagan gods and how at the same time he studiously avoids deifying them. The gods were, to be sure, "de fraca carne humana concebidos", but, had they been lowered to human status, there would have been no place to which the Portuguese might be raised. Bacchus falls, but he falls so that the Portuguese may replace him and occupy his niche, not merely so that they may be glorified by his diminished stature. Most of the gods, moreover, as evidenced in part by Jupiter's role in the guest-friendship ritual, act very much in consonance with the personalities and functions expected of them on the basis of the mythos known to Cam?es. They are no longer all-powerful, but they are reduced to allegory, not to flesh and blood.</page></plain_text>
