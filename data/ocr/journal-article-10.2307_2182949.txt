<plain_text><page sequence="1">SELFHOOD AND GODHOOD A MAJOR philosophical work, in which the author is prepared to [N discuss traditional problems like the ontological status of the self, the freedom of the will, the objectivity of moral obligation, evil and the existence of God, and to do so by methods other than the analysis of ordinary language, stands isolated like the peak of Teneriffe in the sea of analytic philosophy in which British schools are now awash and which is not just lapping, but rather more than overlapping, the shores of the American Continent. Professor C. A. Campbell's Gifford Lectures' constitute such a work, and one which will in no slight measure satisfy the public thirst for constructive and illuminating philosophiz- ing. Campbell's book is full of clear and incisive argument in support of doctrines many of which have been forgotten but are of no less importance on that account. These doctrines, even if not all of them are sound, must nevertheless be reckoned with, and if they are faulty, they must be refuted by rational criticism before they can be abandoned. The younger generation of philosophers for the most part, if they are aware of these doctrines at all, imagine them to have been disposed of by the work of the linguistic analysts. Linguistic analysis is not altogether an improper method of criticism, for we may agree with Campbell that it is an essential part of philosophical thinking and one rarely neglected by any considerable philosopher. But it is no more than a propaedeutic and as it is currently practised its arguments often fail to satisfy sound critical standards. Campbell is quite uncompromising and unapologetic in his refusal to confine himself to any such method, though he is quite prepared to examine and criticize the use of words when necessary (as in his treatment of the meaning and use of "symbol" and "symbolic"); but he is also quite undeceived about the errors into which one can be led by restricting attention to the analysis of sentences, and his critique of recent ethical writing is in consequence penetrating and devastating. The effectiveness of his dialectic fully vindicates his persistence in what he himself refers to with Socratic irony as his "old fashioned manner." Yet there is reason to consider some of his views outdated, not simply because they fail to conform to new vogues in philosophical talk, but because 1 On Selfhood and Godhood. By C. A. Campbell. London, George Allen and Unwin, 1957. Pp. xxxvi, 436. 538</page><page sequence="2">SELFHOOD AND GODHOOD recent progress in knowledge renders them no longer plausible. To these I shall return presently. First let me outline the positive doctrine of the book. Because no theological questions or their answers make sense unless the substantive reality of the soul is assumed, Campbell devotes his first course of lectures to the detailed examination of selfhood. He adopts and restates the judgment theory of cognition developed at the turn of the century by the British Idealists. His revival and defense of this theory (which has never effectively been refuted) is of paramount importance and merits close attention by any who are unfamiliar with the doctrine or imagine it to be unsound. I am not sure that I could endorse quite every point that Professor Campbell makes in his advocacy of it, but the space at my disposal must be reserved for discussion of more important disagreements than might arise here. Campbell points out the two vital truths that the doctrine asserts: the centrality of the act of judgment in human cognition and of self- consciousness in human experience. Here are the first evidences of the substantival nature of the self. What acts (in judging) must be an agent and cannot be simply the activity, and what is aware of itself as a continuing subject and as having and uniting its experiences must be something unitary and persistent over and above the experiences themselves. So Campbell rejects the serial view of the self and can find no satisfactory alternative, in any special sort of relation between or quality of psychical states, to the view that the self is a substance to whose existence our continuous judging activity gives constant testimony, even though we do not and cannot know how its unity and identity are realized. The relation of this substantival self to its body Campbell, after suitable investigation, considers to be de facto and not essential. The self, he holds, is therefore spiritual in character and could conceivably exist without the body. He favors a theory of interaction and sees no difficulty in the conception of a mutual causal relation between body and mind. Knowledge of the self is to be had primarily through introspection, which Campbell defends as a method of knowing, and he finds the capacity to retain and remember further evidence of substantiality. For neither Russellian mnemic causation nor what he calls "the Event-trace theory" (that every experience contains in it traces of all past expe- riences) is plausible, and to explain memory (and its derivatives) one can resort only to a view of the mind as a structure of dispositions capable of being modified by experience. Thus there must be some 539</page><page sequence="3">ERROL E. HARRIS substance or subject to possess the structure. Here an important point about mind is established. The readiness to admit and to talk of mental dispositions is common enough among psychologists and philosophers today, but to say that a propensity is dispositional is usually thought to dispose of the need to postulate any entity which has the disposition. Yet surely if there is nothing which is disposed to act, there is no disposi- tion. Some writers (notably Professor Gilbert Ryle) have attempted to reduce dispositions to sets of hypothetical propositions, forgetting that the basis of all hypotheticals is an existing state of affairs which provides the ground of the implicative nexus between protasis and apodosis. The other modes of self-activity revealed by introspection are desiring and willing. Campbell contends for freedom of the will in a manner which (though no necessitarian) I find difficult to accept and to which I shall return. He then examines the nature and deliverances of the moral consciousness and finds reason to hold that the "ought" of moral judgment is ultimate and unanalyzable, a categorical imperative incumbent upon us. This judgment he takes as conclusive evidence that the moral order has objective reality even though, once again, we cannot understand how the nature of things is or includes a moral order. In his second course Campbell discusses first the general conception of religion, which he defines as "a state of mind comprising belief in a supernatural being or beings endued with transcendent power and worth, together with the complex emotional attitude of worship intrinsically appropriate thereto." This definition would be more acceptable to me if the word "supernatural" were omitted, because of its ambiguity and the questionable suggestion of dualism that it carries. "Transcendent" seems to me to do all that is needed to achieve the result which Campbell seeks-but more of this anon. Though he rightly insists that the elements of belief and emotion are inseparable, Campbell puts belief first, and clearly the essential feature of all religion is its creed. The logical nisus of this belief, under the moulding influence of rational criticism, is towards theism-belief in "a Single, Infinite and Eternal Spirit, Perfect in Power, Wisdom and Goodness, Who is the source of all that is, Who is the Moral Governor of the World and Who is yet a living presence in the hearts of men."2 Campbell sets out to consider whether this belief is true and he finds two main classes of obstacles to its credibility: (i) facts of experience 2 Op. Cit., p. 254. 540</page><page sequence="4">SELFHOOD AND GODHOOD and (ii) internal inconsistencies. The first are the experiences of evil in sin and suffering; the second are the contradictions into which theism falls when it understands the terms literally by which it defines and describes its God. Campbell finds it easily possible to overcome the difficulty presented by sin, because man's freedom, he properly holds, is essential to his responsibility and therefore to the possibility of moral virtue, but it equally involves the possibility of vice. Without the possibility of sin, therefore, there would be nothing of moral value in the world. The difficulty presented by suffering is less easy to dispose of but, with some misgiving, Campbell is prepared to admit as just plausible the joint arguments that excessive undeserved suffering is inevitable in the best of all possible worlds and that for all we can tell it may be compensated in the joys of a future life. But he prefers to hold simply that the ways of God are inscrutable to man. For rational theism, which takes literally the terms descriptive of God, Campbell finds self-contradictory. An omniscient God would be one Who judges always truly. But judgment implies defect. It is the act by which our imperfect knowledge grows and expands and which predicates a "what" of an ever elusive "that." But God's knowledge must comprehend both "that" and "what" and His intellect would thus transcend the possibility ofjudgment. His knowledge could not be discursive or conceptual and may not properly or literally be called knowledge at all. The same is true of will, which implies imperfection for it is the act of bringing into being something we now lack, of seeking fulfilment in something as yet unattained. But God's perfection is beyond all such search and endeavor. Similar arguments would prove all the attributes we ascribe to Him impossible and self-contradictory when raised to an absolute pitch. Rational theism is therefore rejected, but the rejection of religion as such does not follow, for it is possible to understand the predicates applied to God in a purely symbolic sense in which they attribute to Him properties analogous to human virtues but not identical with them. Campbell squarely faces the difficulties of this position but he does not find them insuperable. He holds that a suprarational theism is corroborated by the requirements of sound metaphysics, which demands a self-consistent reality but finds that this demand drives it ultimately beyond the bounds of rational intelligibility. This corrobora- tion extends to belief in God's "unity," "infinity," "eternity," "wis- dom," and "goodness," all symbolically understood. But testimony to the indwelling of the Holy Spirit can be given only in religious experience, the genuineness of which is subject to the test of reason 54'</page><page sequence="5">ERROL E. HARRIS though its deliverances are not, and even in pronouncing on its value as evidence reason can reach only probable conclusions. Complete and adequate discussion of all this would require a book of a size comparable to Professor Campbell's. I shall confine myself to a few points where there seem to me to be weaknesses, due, I think, to the neglect of a doctrine (and its implications) integral to the philosophy from which Campbell draws his main inspiration, that of F. H. Bradley. This is the doctrine of degrees of truth and reality. It can take forms other than that given it by Bradley, but Campbell's failure to take account of it produces aberrations in an otherwise admirable and impressive philosophical enterprise. Consider first the case for the separability of the self from the body. This, one would have thought, nobody would seriously advocate today. One of the readiest criticisms of Ryle's rather labored and repetitive attack on the Cartesian myth is that the ghost (in or out of the machine) had been laid so long ago that further exorcisms seemed hardly necessary. Now here is Professor Campbell reviving the doctrine on the evidence of introspection and on the strength of a criticism of the psychology of G. F. Stout. Campbell argues that even if organic sensations are always present in consciousness, localization of them in the body is not intrinsic to them but is a later interpretation. This, I think, is true, and from it, coupled with the consideration that consciousness without organic sensations is not inconceivable, Campbell concludes that the self is not essentially related to the body. But surely such an argument is far from convincing. First, is consciousness con- ceivable without organic sensations? Are not all sensations in some sense "organic," even though none of them is originally consciously located in the body? And is it not at least probable that there is a sensory aspect (or moment) in all awareness? For all its merits (so well defended by Campbell), the method of introspection is almost bound to mislead us on just this matter. If, like Descartes, we confine attention to what is revealed in immediate consciousness, we are apt to say that it might all possibly appear even if we had no body, because all that ever is or could be revealed in consciousness is a mode of consciousness, whereas the body is a physical thing. Now we have learned that the essence of the cognitive element in consciousness is judgment, and judgment is a twofold process of analysis and synthesis injecting rela- tions into an amorphous content and giving it structure. Consciousness is thus a high degree of integrative activity, unifying and diversifying what, so far as it disintegrates, becomes unconscious. There are, however, lower degrees of this sort of activity. Biology, physiology, and 542</page><page sequence="6">SELFHOOD AND GODHOOD psychology, each at a specific level, reveals self-regulating and unifying processes which, in progressively increasing degrees, simulate the organizing and articulating operation of thought in judgment, and all the scientific evidence at our disposal supports the belief that there is a continuity of process from the purely organic, through the merely reflex and automatic (which may, nevertheless, be in varying degrees conscious and consciously controllable), to the fully conscious and deliberate activity of thinking. I suspect that even introspection would reveal subconscious processes emerging into consciousness (as when we introspect the lower levels of attention). Would it not be better, therefore, to maintain that body and mind are not separate entities related externally (whether causally or otherwise) but are different degrees or levels of a continuous process? This even admits of Ryle's conclusion that they are different categories; certainly if we adopt Hegel's use of the word "category" it would be a very fitting definition. It seems to me that if Campbell is to carry his point here he must deal not only with Stout (whose arguments are far from cogent) but, quite apart from Ryle (who reaches the right conclusion from the wrong premises), with Spinoza and Hegel, with Whitehead and Alexander, with Bosanquet, and even with Bradley. Certainly when we turn to the will and find its freedom defended on the ground that we can will to act against our formed character, Bradley must stir in his grave. Formed character, for Campbell, is the product of heredity and environment, which are not within our control, and this determines our desires and their relative strengths. But we can nevertheless act, he maintains, contrary to our strongest desire when duty requires it, and our decision so to act is therefore free, as it must be if we are to be morally responsible. Such decisions are "inexplicable" in the sense that they cannot be inferred from determin- ing conditions, and to ask for an explanation of them is thus absurd. But what sort of freedom is this? Can we do better than give Bradley's reply ? "Turn it as we will, the libertas arbitrii is no more at last than contingentia arbitrii. Freedom means chance; you are free because there is no reason which will account for your particular acts, because no one in the world, not even yourself, can possibly say what you will, or will not, do next. You are 'accountable,' in short, because you are a wholly 'unaccountable' creature."3 The criticism seems to me unanswerable. If free action is unaccountable, we cannot be held responsible for it. I might well plead, "I couldn't help it; I (my will) 3 Ethical Studies (Oxford, 1927), p. I I. 543 8</page><page sequence="7">ERROL E. HARRIS did it in spite of myself (my character)." Campbell refuses to identify self with character, where Bradley insists on the identification. If it then be asked how I can form and reform my character, surely Bradley's answer is correct: "that the character of a man is not what is made, but what makes itself, out of and from the disposition and environment."4 If we think of will as a higher level of integrative action than simply inherited propensities, and of conscious learning (practical and theoretical) as the process of their organization in the formation of character, the process itself is seen to be one with judgment, and action is free in the same sense as thought is free, in so far as it is self-conscious and self-determining. The peculiarity of Campbell's theory is that he confines freedom to those admittedly rare actions in which we are faced with a choice between duty and our strongest desire, and he confesses that in 95 per cent of our acts this choice does not arise. It should follow that when duty and desire coincide we deserve no credit for acting rightly, as in such cases we are neither free nor responsible. This implies that action from desire is not strictly action at all and that when duty and inclination are at one our behavior is amoral. Surely this cannot be intended, but if not, what is? Campbell's strictures upon rational theism and his defense of supra- rational theism seem to me to suffer from the same neglect of the doctrine of degrees. As a protest against the sort of theology which offers us a finite and anthropomorphic God acting upon the natural world from without as a despotic ruler, Campbell's critique of rational theism is to be welcomed. But it is not clear that any such protest is his object. Rather he gives the impression that he is attacking any and every attempt to rationalize the faith and to make the nature of God intelligible. This he feels is never possible, because God utterly transcends man and the world and can be described only in symbolic terms. Yet if God is the acme and summit of a perfection of which man's virtues are, at however great a distance, a lesser degree, then it will follow quite naturally that such terms as "unity," "power," "wisdom," and "love" will apply differently, though analogously, to man and to God. God may well transcend man and the world infinitely and yet be immanent in and continuous with them. Differences in degree, we may admit, when widely separated, amount also to differ- ences in kind and may even be regarded as in some sense opposite. But to be so different and opposed is not the same as to be "wholly other." Of course, our minds cannot reach the stage at which God's 4 Ibid., P. 2 2. 544</page><page sequence="8">SELEHOOD AND GODHOOD character could be adequately comprehended. If they could we should become omniscient. But this is not sufficient reason for alleging that the difference cannot be one of degree at all and that our thought and God's differ toto coelo. Campbell at times seems on the verge of suggesting some form of the doctrine of degrees and, if he had, the antithesis between rational and supranational theism might have been resolved. Then the demands of the intellect might well be made the basis for belief in the objective truth of religion and the existence of a transcendent God in a more convincing fashion than by representing the wholly unintelligible as the goal of the intellect. A similar approach might also help to solve the problem of evil and suffering. I think that Campbell's discussions of sin are essentially sound, but that on the problem of suffering there is more to be said.5 If suffering is a defect incidental to a specific degree of development, its reality and its inevitability would nevertheless be compatible with the realization of perfection. Indeed, the graded scale of forms might be the essential mode of self-specification of the ultimately real, and development the indispensable condition of achievement. Suffering would then turn out to be the steep and thorny path by traversing which alone the highest values can be reached. If it were eliminated, so would be everything of greatest worth. Is there then need to go further and to advocate any dubious doctrine of an after life with its compensating joys? My inability to agree with Professor Campbell at all points does not detract from my respect and admiration for the courage and honesty of his thinking and the massive importance of its results. If the younger generation of students can be brought to read this book with the care and attention it deserves, and sincerely to ponder the questions it so meticulously analyzes, much will have been done to further the cause of philosophy and truth.
