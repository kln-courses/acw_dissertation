ABSTRACT The SID-lls is a small [s], second-generation [II] Side Impact Dummy [SID] which has the anthropometry of a 5th percentile adult female. It has a mass of 43.5 kg, a seated height of 790 mm, and over 100 available data channels. Based on the height and mass, this is equiv- alent to an average 12-13 year old adolescent. The state-of-the-art SID-lls has special application in evalu- ating the performance of side impact airbags. The dummy has undergone prototype testing and will shortly be available for worldwide evaluation. This paper de- scribes the technical details of the dummy, its biomechanical design targets, how well it met those targets, its validation requirements, and its instrumen- tation. The dummy is the product of a joint develop- ment agreement between the Occupant Safety Re- search Partnership (OSRP) of USCAR and First Tech- nology Safety Systems. WHY THE SID-lls? The SID-lls is being developed to: • help evaluate proposed side impact countermea- sures, such as side airbags, for the smaller seg- ment of the population. This smaller segment in- cludes both children and small adults • help harmonize between existing side impact dum- mies towards one design worldwide by offering the beginning of a family of biofidelic Anthropomorphic Test Devices (ATD's) with as much worldwide input as possible. BACKGROUND On June 8, 1 992, the United States Council on Automo- tive Research (USCAR) was formed as an organization for precompetitive research among Chrysler, Ford and General Motors. The Occupant Safety Research Part- nership (OSRP), was formed in July 1992 under the USCAR umbrella, with a mission (in part) to "conduct or direct precompetitive research and development of crash test dummies..." The development of a small, second generation side impact dummy was proposed to the OSRP in 1993 due to the need for an Anthropomor- phic Test Device (ATD) that would be better suited to help evaluate the biomechanical performance of ad- vanced side impact countermeasures, notably airbags, when the occupant is smaller than the mid-male SID(1), BIOSID*2,3'4' and EUROSID-1'5,6,7'8' side impact ATD's currently available. Data from frontal testing'9' indicated that, for similar airbag deployment exposures, the smaller occupant (as represented by the small female Hybrid III dummy) is generally subjected to higher load- ing than the average size occupant (as represented by the mid-male Hybrid III'10' dummy). The OSRP membership of the "Small Size Advanced Side Impact Dummy Task Group" first met in January 1994 to define the general characteristics of the pro- posed ATD before vendors were contacted. The group realized that the side impact situation is considerably different than frontal impacts, especially when airbags are one of the countermeasures used, in that the occu- pant is normally seated or can often be expected to be seated very close to, or in contact with, the point of airbag inflation. Therefore, the proposed test device needed to be sensitive to many different input impulses 3212</page><page sequence="2">from many different airbag deployment directions, and be able to accurately indicate the effects on the dummy of rapid inflation. Further, since side impact crash forces are broadly distributed, it was felt that biomechanically-based data measurements needed to be made from head to ankle. The group decided to name the new dummy the SID-lls because it is a small [s] second generation [II] side impact dummy [SID], A joint development agreement was signed between OSRP and First Technology Safety Systems (FTSS) defining the roles and responsibilities of each party. OSRP responsibilities included developing the SID-lls dummy specifications and evaluating the prototype dummy. FTSS was responsible for designing and manufacturing the prototype, and initial verification to OSRP specifications. Joint meetings were held ap- proximately every five weeks. The task group has actively sought input from the ex- pert delegates to the International Standards Organiza- tion (ISO) Technical Committee 22/Subcommittee 12/Working Group 5, "Anthropomorphic Test Devices." The OSRP has kept WG5 informed of the progress of this dummy, both orally and in written reports, from shortly after its inception. ANTHROPOMETRY The anthropometry for the "smaller" ATD generated considerable discussion. Data(11,12) were reviewed on the anthropometry of generic (combined male and female) people from ages 4-18 (Table 1; Figures 1-4). Young children less than 6 years old generally are in child restraints and therefore positioned away from deploying airbags and somewhat shielded from the vehicle side. Therefore, a dummy simulating a child younger than 6-years of age was excluded from further consideration. The above anthropometric data show that the current "small" female Hybrid III ATD has the approximate anthropometry (mass and seated height) of a generic 50th percentile 12-13 year old. This size is approxi- mately half way between a six-year old and the 50th percentile male in erect seated height and body mass, as seen in Figures 1-4. Therefore, the anthropometry of the small female was chosen as the best compro- mise for a single smaller dummy. This simplified fabri- cation of the SID-lls by allowing the use of some exist- ing or only slightly modified dummy parts and instru- mentation.

The SID-lls has a total mass of 43.5 kg, somewhat lighter than the Hybrid III small female ATD, which has a mass of 48.6 kg. The 43.5 kg mass reflects the removal of most of the arm masses which are not be- lieved to be important in side crashes. The erect sitting height is 790 mm. THE SID-lls - GENERAL The group reviewed all currently-existing side impact ATD's (SID, BIOSID and EUROSID-1) and sought to incorporate the best features of these three dummies and to incorporate additional features into the SID-lls as 60 -i 50TH MALE 5TH FEMALE 50- ļ Ę 13 YEAR OLD X jT (MALE AND FEMALE) i 40 - a M. ^ P X U 20- § CD 10- 0-1 , 1 1 1 0 5 10 15 20 AGE Figure 4 Buttock-to-knee length data for children 4- 18 years of age, compared to buttock-to- knee length of the mid male and small fe- male Hybrid III dummies. necessary to help meet the unique applications envi- sioned for this dummy. The initial design direction was to make the SID-lls a metric ATD. However, since existing Hybrid III parts are not metric, it was believed that the mixture of english and metric parts in a typical dummy lab could result in confusion and damage to the dummy by using one type fastener in the other type threaded hole. Therefore, the prototype is built with English (SAE) fasteners. In the future an all-metric version could be built. The SID-lls has 111 available, non-redundant instru- mentation channels. This large number of channels is necessary because of the variety of possible side im- pact countermeasures this dummy may encounter. Only a select portion of these channels would be ex- pected to be used in any one test, and the selection would depend on the countermeasure(s) being evaluat- ed. The SID-lls is pictured in a front and side view in Fig- ures 5 and 6, and next to a SID, EUROSID-1 and BIOSID in Figure 7. THE SID-lls RESPONSE TARGETS, VERIFICATION TEST REQUIREMENTS, AND PERFORMANCE AGAINST OBJECTIVES The response targets given in Appendix A are the biomechanical response goals for the SID-lls. They were derived from the responses of cadavers and vol- unteers subjected to lateral pendulum impacts, drop 3214</page><page sequence="4">Figure 5.

These tests assess the biofidelity of the SID-lls as a human surrogate for later- al impact testing.

The tests are simplified drop tests and pendulum im- pacts to check whether the dummies are reliably repro- duced and adequately maintained. Many requirements will change since they eventually will be based on the responses of the first 10-12 production dummies.

HEAD AND NECK Technical Description and Discussion The SID-lls head and neck (Figure 8) are from the small female Hybrid III dummy, with symmetrical right- left impact performance. Two millimeters of aluminum were shaved off the skull sides which allowed increased vinyl thickness so the head would meet the OSRP response targets given in Appendix A without changing its external dimensions. The group discussed scaling down the EUROSID-1 neck to a small female size, but decided not enough is known about small occupant neck performance to com- plicate the ATD parts inventory. Further, the EUROSID-1 scaled neck would need substantial revi- sion to allow the use of the desired Denton (or equiva- lent) six-channel neck load cells. The mid-male Hybrid III dummy neck was chosen for the BIOSID because this neck closely met human mid-male lateral neck performance'13' as determined from volunteer tests. The small female Hybrid III neck is a scaled mid-male Hybrid III neck and should represent small female hu- man performance. Consequently, this neck was cho- sen for the SID-lls. The biomechanical response targets for the head and neck are included in Appendix A, the proposed verifica- tion requirements are in Appendix B and performance against objectives is given in Appendix C. Additional modifications to the neck are the isolation of the metal cable in the neck from any metal-to-metal contact by plastic bushings. This bushing arrangement is shown in Figure 9. Also, a neck shroud (Figure 10) has been developed for the SID-lls. This shroud has minimal effect on neck response and we recommend that it (or any future improved shroud) be used whenev- er there is a possibility of an airbag contacting the dummy's neck area. The soft urethane shroud as finally configured for the prototype has a mass of 105- 115 g. Instrumentation Head are neck instrumentation are the same as that available for the small female Hybrid III -- a head triaxial accelerometer package and upper and lower 6- channel neck load cells. Provision is made for a grounding strap between the head and the dummy torso for airbag testing to reduce the possibility of erro- neous instrumentation readings due to static discharge. Figure 8.

These packages usually consist of 9-15 precisely located accelerometers. These packages could be used in the SID-lls head, but are not Included in the normally-avail- able instrumentation given in Table 2. SHOULDER AND ARM Technical Description and Discussion The shoulder structures of lateral impact ATD's are either articulated (e.g. EUROSID-1), laterally displacing (e.g. BIOSID) or non-existent (e.g. SID). Since it was deemed important to obtain both shoulder load and displacement measurements, and the articulating shoul- der design used in the EUROSID-1 has bound up in a number of crash tests conducted by OSRP-member companies'141, the group decided to use a laterally- displacing shoulder (Figure 11). Appendix A shows the shoulder response target data used in the design of the SID-lls. These data, from ISO'15' and newer sources, were scaled from a mid- male to a small female. Much of these data involve combined cadaver shoulder and thorax impacts, so corridors also have been established for this impact condition, but only those data where serious fractures did not occur were used. Muscle tone of 400 N was added by the group. A stub upper arm similar to, but more rounded than the BIOSID arm, and stiffer than the EUROSID-1 arm, has been incorporated into the SID-lls (Figure 12). Its length is about 7 mm shorter than the small female Hybrid III upper arm (shoulder-to-elbow) so as to not confound the deflection of the abdominal "ribs." A Figure 11. The SID-lls laterally-displacing shoulder with impacted-side triaxial load cell at the shoulder joint. Note accelerometer mount at load cell.

The stub arm, shaped to interact airbags that may deploy from the rear of vehicle in relation to the dummy position. Note pad at the shoulder location and one of the two triaxial accelerometer packages. Instrumentation A linear potentiometer, discussed below, is used to measure shoulder deflection. A shoulder load cell is located on the impacted side of the dummy where it can measure arm Fx and Fz loads as well as shoulder lateral (Fy) loads (Figure 11). These measurements could be important to help evaluate airbag designs which can contact the arm during deployment -- espe- cially deployment from the seat back or B-pillar areas. For the arm, the humerus bone simulation is a hollow tube containing two triaxial accelerometer packs - one near the shoulder and one near the elbow -- to help resolve the forces and kinematics of the upper arm when struck by a forward-deploying seat-mounted side airbag, or a forward- or rearward-deploying door-mount- ed side airbag. THORAX Technical Description and Discussion The group believes that the two primary side impact thoracic injury indicators are localized rib cage displace- ment and the Viscous Criterion (V*C)(16). Further, it was believed necessary to have the capability to measure rib deflections to 75 mm without binding, bottoming or permanently deforming. It also is important to assure accurate displacement-time measurement at rib veloci- ties up to 10-12 m/s, reaching peak velocity within 4 ms, since a deploying airbag may drive the rib cage up to these velocities. The detection of localized stiffness gradients was considered important; hence a multiple rib design was required (Figure 13). The rib cage is externally tied together with a durable polyurethane elastomeric material (Figure 13) to couple the ribs. The rib cage Ensolite® "padding" is placed in pockets in the chest jacket for easy replacement (Figure 14). Figure 13. The SID-lls thoracic 3-rib ribcage with Polyurethane rib coupling arrangement- Figure 14. Padding pouches in the chest jacket which allows for easy padding replacement. Appendix A gives the chest response targets used in the development of the SID-lls. The data, from ISO(17) and newer sources, were scaled from mid-size males to a small female. Some of these data involve combined shoulder and thorax impacts, so corridors also have been established for this impact condition, but only those cadaver tests where massive rib fractures did not occur were used. Muscle tone of 500 N, scaled from Reference 18, has been added as deemed appropriate for the older population base, which probably Is conser- vative for adolescents of the age represented by this dummy. The half-thorax dimension used in the calcula- tion of V*C is 142 mm. Appendix B gives the draft verification test requirements for the thorax, and Appen- dix C gives the SID-lls available performance against objectives . Instrumentation Thoracic instrumentation consists of T1 and T12 triaxial accelerometer packages, rib triaxial accelerometer 3218</page><page sequence="8">Figure 15. A typical spine box-to-rib cage miniature load cell and its retainer. These load cells help indicate forces generated by a for- ward-deploying "chest"-type airbag. Figure 16. Thoracic rib cage linear displacement transducer arrangement. packages and rib linear potentiometers. Also, miniature load cells (Figure 15) are installed on the spine box to help indicate forward loading on the ribs caused by a "chest" airbag deploying from behind. The x-facing rib accelerometers are also intended to help indicate the severity of such loading. The lateral deflection mea- surement is made using three linear potentiometers (Figure 16) (one per rib) to help ensure no-lag readings at higher rib velocities, something not possible with the BIOSID string pots. After much searching, the group decided to use a Data Instruments Model MLT 102 mm stroke Linear Position Transducer (LPT) mounted by a universal bearing. This LPT is sufficiently free of elec- trical noise to allow accurate Viscous Criterion calcula- tions and is sufficiently durable to handle off-center loads. Testing in an out-of-position airbag environment indicates good performance up to 8-10 m/s. The LPT's are attached to the spine box in a manner that keeps the angle of the shafts as small as practicable when fore-aft (x-axis) movement of the ribcage occurs. Laboratory and full scale crash testing conducted by OSRP indicate that lateral rib acceleration minus lateral spine box acceleration gives very accurate and smooth rib peak velocity and Viscous Criterion data (Figures 17 arid 18). Therefore, the dummy will be equipped to measure lateral rib acceleration and lateral spine accel- eration laterally opposite (to the extent possible) each rib. Figure 17. Comparison of dummy rib velocity between linear potentiometer integration method and rib and spine acceleration subtraction method - out-of-position generic airbag deployment. Figure 18. The Viscous Criterion calculated by the same methods as in Figure 17. 3219</page><page sequence="9">ABDOMEN Technical Description and Discussion Considerable discussion ensued as to whether the SID- I Is should have a deflection-measuring abdomen or an internal load-measuring abdomen. The group decided that deflection and its corollary, V*C, were very impor- tant indicators of abdominal injury, so the dummy should be able to indicate these parameters. This necessitated a rib-like abdomen (Figure 19). The de- sign of the abdominal rib cage is essentially the same as for the thorax, except there are only two ribs instead of three. The same type of external flexible rib covering as for the thorax also is used to cover the abdominal ribs. This covering is separate from the thoracic flexible rib covering. As shown in Appendix A, scaled abdomi- nal response targets were developed, again using only the ISO(19) and other data where serious injuries to the cadaver did not occur. Draft abdominal verification test requirements are given in Appendix B. The available performance against objectives is shown in Appendix C. Figure 19. Abdominal two-rib arrangement to permit measurement of abdominal displacement and the calculation of the Viscous Criterion. Note Polyurethane rib coupling system. Instrumentation Each abdominal rib is instrumented with a triaxial accel- erometer package and a linear potentiometer of the type used for the thorax (Figure 20). The forward load- ing of the top abdominal rib is measured by a miniature load cell located on the spine box. Forward loading of the bottom abdominal rib is not measured because the spine box is cut off in that area to reduce the possibility of lumbar spine interference. LUMBAR SPINE AND PELVIS Figure 20. Abdominal linear potentiometers as viewed from bottom of the ribcage. Technical Description and Discussion The lumbar spine is a modified small female Hybrid III lumbar spine, with a single step shape in side view (Figure 21). The upper portion is smaller in diameter to better clear the abdominal lower rib and its instrumenta- tion, while the lower portion is of larger diameter. This spine gives increased lateral stability to the lighter SID- lls compared to BIOSID. The metal cable in the spine is isolated from any metal-to-metal contact by plastic bushings (Figure 22), as in the neck. Provision is made for an electrical grounding strap between the spine box and the pelvis to help dissipate the static electrical charge that may occur as a result of the rapid rubbing of airbag cloth on the dummy during airbag deployment. The group decided that a new pelvis design was need- ed (Figures 23 and 24) to measure the desired parame- ters as discussed below, to meet ISO(20) and other new performance data, and to provide greater thigh inward movement (adduction of the femurs) and a soft stop to Figure 21. The stepped-shape rubber lumbar spine. 3220</page><page sequence="10">Figure 22. The plastic bushing arrangement used to isolate the lumbar spine cable from metal- to-metal contact with surrounding spine parts. Figure 23.

The shortened pubic load cell shows up as two short parallel white lines. prevent metal-to-metal contact between the thigh and pelvis. The greater thigh movement required a new femur-to-acetabulum attachment (Figure 25). A thick, 63 mm diameter Styrofoam® single-use acetabulum "plug" is used to control pelvic energy absorption and to meet the impact response goals given in Appendix A. A search is on-going for a reusable material that meets the performance goals. As in other body areas, the available pelvic impact data have been scaled to esti- mate small female performance. The pelvic response targets are given in Appendix A, draft verification test requirements in Appendix B, and available performance against objectives in Appendix C. Figure 25. The femur-to-acetabulum attachment joint (with acetabulum load cell removed). Instrumentation A six-channel load cell to measure lower lumbar spine forces and moments is included between the bottom of the lumbar spine and the top of the pelvis. The group desired to measure ilium load and total acetabulum load - essentially all the forces that can enter the pelvis during a side impact ~ as well as pubic symphysis load. The ilium load cell is similar to that used in BIOSID. The acetabulum energy absorbing "plug" holder was converted into an Fy load cell to indicate direct loading of the simulated greater trochanter (Figure 26). An upper femur Fy load cell, at its attachment to the ace- tabulum, measures leg shear loading into the acetabu- lum. The combination of this load and the direct load through the greater trochanter gives the total acetabu- lum load. The Fy pubic load cell (Figure 24) was sub- stantially reduced in lateral length from other ATD's. This permitted the greater thigh inward lateral move- ment previously discussed. The measurement of sa- crum load was determined not to be necessary since the main injury sources are measured by the other load cells. Pelvic triaxial acceleration also is measured. 3221</page><page sequence="11">Figure 26.

LOWER EXTREMITIES The thighs and legs of the small female Hybrid III ATD are used for the SID-lls, except for unique upper fe- murs. Therefore, all the small female Hybrid III leg instrumentation will be available as detailed in Table 2 except the fore-aft knee displacement potentiometer which was believed to have no relevance for side im- pact.

Experts of the International Standards Organization (ISO) TC22/ SC12/WG5 reviewed all pertinent cadaver and volun- teer data to establish impact response requirements for average male side impact dummies. These response requirements are given in the ISO Technical Reports (TR) 9790-1 through 6(A1A6). The authors of this SID-Ils paper reviewed these data, excluded the responses of massively injured cadavers and added the results of new tests which were not available when the ISO es- tablished requirements for the average male. The response data of the average male were scaled by the techniques of Mertz(A7) and Mertz et al.(A8) to estimate the responses of a small adult female. No adjustments were made to estimate the responses of adolescents or the elderly, although most response targets were devel- oped from the responses of older cadavers. A dummy that satisfies the response targets given below meets the design targets of a fifth percentile adult female. Note that the SID-Ils may not meet all of the prescribed response targets. Some of the targets were deemed to be of greater significance than others. Other tests could not be duplicated because the padding used in the original cadaver tests is no longer available. It is likely that response targets imposed by different test conditions may conflict. In particular, two of the neck response targets are based on the responses of volun- teers, while the third is based on the response of a cadaver whose neck fractured. In some design targets, the force has been increased to account for muscle tone present in the driving population, but absent in the flaccid, unembalmed cadavers. This appendix is arranged by the type of tests since several tests measure the responses of multiple body regions. Table A1 lists the various impact response targets by body region and gives a brief description of the test conditions. The tests specified below are being used to evaluate the biofidelity of the design. PENDULUM IMPACTS Shoulder Response Target 1: This response target is based on pendulum impacts to the shoulders of cadav- ers conducted by the Association Peugeot-Renault TABLE A1.

The force versus time histories of the cadav- er impacts were normalized by the ISO(A4) to represent the response of an average male, then scaled by the OSRP task group to estimate the response of a small adult female. The scaled results are shown in Figure A1.

Seat it upright, with its arm down on the impacted side. Strike the dummy's shoulder laterally with a 14 kg rigid impactor (150 mm diameter flat impact face) between 4.4 and 4.6 m/s. The pendulum mass was reduced such that the impact severity to the SID-lls is equivalent to that of an average male impacted by a 23 kg pendu- lum. Filter the response data according to the require- ments of SAE Recommended Practice J211/1, MAR 1995(A10), for channel class 1000. The target for the force versus time history of the SID-lls is shown in Figure A1 and the target for maximum shoulder deflec- tion is 22 to 30 mm. Note that the peak force of the corridor is 400 N greater than the scaled cadaver re- sponses to account for muscle tone which was absent in the cadavers. Thorax Response Target 1: Lateral impacts to cadav- ers were conducted by the Highway Safety Research Institute of the University of Michigan(A11) and oblique lateral impacts were conducted at Wayne State Univer- sity for the General Motors Research Laboratories(A12). The force versus time histories of the cadavers were normalized by the ISO(A2) to represent the responses of an average male. The acceleration versus time history of T1 from the 4.3 m/s impact was also normalized by the ISO. The OSRP group reviewed these data, ex- cluded the results of cadavers who sustained more than five rib fractures and scaled the remaining responses to estimate the responses of a small adult female. The estimated force versus time histories and thoracic spine acceleration versus time histories for a small adult female subjected to a 4.3 m/s pendulum impact are shown in Figures A2 and A3, respectively. Figure A4 shows the estimated force versus time history for a small adult female subjected to a 6.7 m/s pendulum impact. Instrument the SID-lls with thoracic accelerometers. Seat the SID-lls in an upright posture with the arm raised. Strike the lateral aspect of the dummy's thorax with a 14 kg rigid impactor (150 mm diameter flat im- pact face) at a velocity of either 4.3 or 6.7 m/s. The pendulum mass was reduced such that the impact severity to the SID-lls Is equivalent to that of an aver- age male impacted by a 23 kg pendulum. Filter the impactor force and lateral thoracic spine acceleration using the 100 Hz FIR filter.(A11) The response corridors for the force versus time history and thoracic accelera- tion versus time history of the SID-lls impacted at 4.3 m/s are shown, respectively, in Figures A2 and A3. The response corridor for the force versus time history of the SID-lls impacted at 6.7 m/s is shown in Figure A4. No target has been set for the peak normalized thoracic acceleration resulting from a 6.7 m/s impact.

Figure A5 shows the scaled peak force versus pendulum impact velocity. Instrument the SID-lls with pelvic accelerometers. Strike the seated dummy in the region of the greater trochanter with a 10 kg rigid impactor (350 mm diame- ter impact face with a 600 mm radius of curvature) between 6 and 10 m/s. The pendulum mass was re- duced such that the impact severity to the SID-lls is equivalent to that of an average male impacted by a 17.3 kg pendulum. Filter the data to Channel Class 1000 as given in SAE J211/1 MAR 1995(A10). The re- sponse corridor for the peak impactor force as a func- tion of impact velocity is shown in Figure A5. LATERAL DROPS Head Response Target 1: Hodgson and Thomas(A16) conducted a series of non fracture, cadaver head im- pact tests. Cadavers were strapped on their sides to a pallet which rotated about a pivot to achieve a pre- scribed drop height for the head. The cadaver's head and neck extended over the free end of the pallet. The ISO(A1) set requirements for the resultant head accelera- tion of an average male. The OSRP group scaled the peak resultant accelerations to estimate the responses of a small adult female. The scaled results are shown by the open circles in Figure A6.

Position it 200 mm above a flat, rigid impact surface and orient it so that its midsag- ittal plane makes an angle of 35° with the impact sur- face. Filter the accelerations at channel frequency class 1000 Hz, according to the requirements of SAE Recommended Practice J211/1 MAR 1995(A10). The response target for the peak resultant head acceleration is 106 G to 158 G for a 200 mm free fall drop (2 m/s) onto a flat, rigid surface. 3226</page><page sequence="16">Head Response Target 2: The APR(A17) dropped four cadavers from a height of 1.2 m onto a rigid surface covered by a 5 mm thick rubber pad. The peak resul- tant accelerations of the two cadavers without skull fractures were used by the ISO(A1) to set requirements for the resultant head acceleration of an average adult male (TR 9790-1 )(A1&gt;. The OSRP group scaled the peak resultant accelerations to estimate the responses of a small adult female. The scaled results are shown by the solid circles in Figure A6. Instrument the head of the SID-lls with a triaxial accel- erometer located at its center of gravity. Conduct the tests with only the head of the SID-lls. Position it 1200 mm above the impact surface and orient it so that its midsagittal plane makes an angle of 10° with the impact surface. Cover a flat rigid surface with a 5 mm thick pad of natural rubber (Shore A Hardness = 50, Rupture Strength = 14 MPa, Tear Strength = 15 kN/m). Filter the accelerations at channel frequency class 1000 Hz, according to the requirements of SAE Recommended Practice J21 1/2 MAR 1995(A10). The response target for the peak resultant head acceleration is 221 G to 299 G for a 1200 mm free fall drop onto the padded surface. Thorax Response Target 2 and Pelvis Response Target 2: Unembalmed cadavers were subjected to lateral free falls by researchers of the APR(A18, A19, ^0, ^1'. The force versus time histories, peak thoracic deflections, and the peak pelvic accelerations of the cadavers were normalized by the iso(A3,A6) to represent the responses of an average male. The OSRP group scaled the normalized results to estimate the responses of a small adult female. The estimated thoracic force versus time histories of a small adult female are shown in Figures A7 and A8 for the 1 m rigid and 2 m padded drops, respectively. The thoracic force versus time histories from the 0.5 m rigid and 3.0 m padded drops were not available. Instrument the SID-lls with thoracic and pelvic acceler- ometers, and rib deflection transducers. Suspend the dummy with its sagittal plane horizontal and its arms rotated 20° forward of its thoracic spine. Locate the two loading surfaces, instrumented with inertia-compen- sated load cells, to intercept the dummy's thorax and pelvis separately. The thorax loading surface for the rigid impacts must be large enough to insure that the shoulder is impacted. Use 140 x 140 x 420 mm blocks of open cell urethane foam (APR padding described in references A3 and A6) for the padded impacts. Filter the impact forces, thoracic and pelvic accelerations, and thoracic deflections at channel frequency class 1 80 Hz, according to the requirements of SAE Recommend- ed Practice J211/1 MAR 1995&lt;A10).

The original im- pact forces, and the peak T12 and impacted rib accel- erations of the cadavers were normalized by the ISO(A5). The normalized force versus time histories were then scaled by the OSRP group to estimate the responses of a small adult female, as shown in Figures A9 and A10 for the 1 and 2 m free falls, respectively. Instrument the SID-lls with lower spinal accelerometers, abdominal rib accelerometers, and abdominal rib de- flection transducers. Drop the SID-lls from either 1 or 2 m onto a rigid hardwood armrest (70 mm in width and of sufficient height to protrude 33 mm above the sur- rounding surface). Instrument the armrest with load cells. Filter the armrest load and accelerations at chan- nel frequency class 180 Hz, according to the require- ments of SAE Recommended Practice J211/1 MAR 1995(A10). The response corridors for the force versus time history of the armrest load are shown in Figures A9 and A10 for the 1 and 2 m drops, respectively. The response targets for the peak accelerations of the lower spine and rib, and the peak deflection of the abdominal ribs are given in Table A3. SLED TESTS Neck Response Target 1 and Shoulder Response Target 2: Ewing et al.(A23) subjected volunteers to later- al neck bending tests using their HYGE accelerator. The volunteers were restrained snugly against a lightly padded wooden board which restricted upper torso rotation and pelvis to sled translation. The data used for the ISO requirements'^' A4&gt; were taken from an analysis by Wismans et al.(A24) Instrument the SID-lls with triaxial accelerometer pack- ages at the centers of gravity of the head and chest, an accelerometer at the base of the neck, and a six-axis neck transducer at the neck to head interface.

Neck Response Target 2: Patrick and Chou(A25) sub- jected volunteers to lateral neck bending tests using a decelerator sled. The volunteers were restrained in a rigid chair with a 15° seat back angle. Their shoulders and hips were firmly against the side board. The data from the most severe test were used by the ISO(A2) to specify the response target. In that test, the peak sled velocity was 5.8 m/s with a constant deceleration of 6.7 G. Instrument the SID-lls with a triaxial accelerometer at the center of gravity of the head and a six-axis neck transducer at the neck to head interface. Securely fasten the dummy in the seat with its shoulder and hip against the side board. Use photographic targets to measure the specified head motions. Accelerate the sled to a speed of 5.8 m/s without disturbing the dummy's position and then decelerate it to zero velocity at a constant level of 6.7 G. The response targets are given in Table A5.

Tarriere estimated the maximum horizon- tal and vertical head displacements and peak head flexion and torsion angles from one test. These results were used by the ISO(A2) to define the response require- ments for an average adult male. Instrument the SID-lls with a triaxial accelerometer at the center of gravity of the head, a triaxial accelerome- ter in the thoracic spine in the region of T1, and a six- axis neck transducer at the head to neck interface. Secure the dummy in an upright posture, with its shoul- der and hip against the vertical side board. Use photo- graphic targets to measure the translation of the center of gravity of the head, lateral head rotation, head twist and T1 translation. Filter the response data according to the requirements of SAE Recommended Practice J211/1 MAR 1995(A10) for channel class 180 for T1 and 1 000 for the head. The response corridor for the lateral acceleration versus time history of T1 is shown in Fig- ure A11 and the remaining response targets given in Table A6. Thorax Response Target 3 and Pelvis Response Target 2: Researchers at the University of Heidelberg'*27' conducted sled tests in which unembalmed cadavers impacted individual loading surfaces with the thorax and pelvis. Rigid surface impacts were conducted at 6.8 and 8.9 m/s. Padded surface impacts were conducted at 8.9 m/s. The ISO(A3, A6) normalized the impact sur- face forces, and the accelerations of T1, T12, the 4th rib and the pelvis. The group reviewed the available data and excluded from their analysis all thoracic re- sponses of cadavers who sustained more than 5 rib fractures.

Thorax Response Target 4. Abdomen Response Target 2. and Pelvis Response Target 4: A series of lateral sled impacts was conduct- ed at Wayne State University(A28, ^9'. These tests were similar to the sled tests conducted by the University of Heidelberg, except the impact wall had individual load- ing surfaces for the shoulder, thorax, abdomen, pelvis and knee, and paper honeycomb was used in the pad- ded tests. Three-dimensional film analysis was per- formed on 7 of the 1 7 tests and the instrumentation and film data were normalized by lrwin(A30i A31). The group reviewed these data and excluded the thoracic respons- es of cadavers who sustained more than 5 rib fractures and scaled the remaining responses to estimate the responses of a small adult female. Figures A13 and A14 show the force versus time histories of the abdo- men and pelvis, respectively, from the 6.8 m/s rigid impacts. Figures A15 and A16 show the force versus time histories of the abdomen and pelvis, respectively, from the 8.9 m/s rigid impacts. Figures A17, A18 and A1 9 show the force versus time histories of the shoul- der plus thorax, abdomen, and pelvis, respectively, from the 8.9 m/s padded impacts.

These tests and their require- ments were derived by the scaling method of Mertz (B1) from the verification tests of the BIOSID (B2), and are in their draft form. Meeting these draft requirements is secondary to meeting the Appendix A biomechanical requirements where the two might lead in different directions. The final verification requirements will be established from the responses of the first 10 to 12 production SID-lls dummies. Lateral Head Drop Test This test is conducted with only the head of the SID-lls, instrumented with a triaxial accelerometer package at the center of gravity of the head. Position the head 200 mm above a flat, rigid impact surface and orient it so that its mid-sagittal plane makes an angle of 35° with the impact surface. Use a quick-release mechanism to drop the head onto the rigid impact surface. Filter the accelerations at channel frequency class 1000 Hz, according to the requirements of SAE Recommended Practice J211/1, MAR 1995 (B3). A peak resultant head acceleration of 130 to 160 G is the proposed scaled response requirement. Neck Pendulum Test The standard Part 572 pendulum test fixture is used, with the neck of the SID-lls attached at an angle of 90° from the normal frontal orientation. A symmetric head mass has been designed for use with this test to reduce neck z-axis rotation, similar to the mass used with the EUROSID-1 neck test. Instrument the symmetric head mass and neck assembly with a six channel upper neck load cell and with rotation transducers at the top and bottom of the neck on the side that has the neck slots (to further reduce neck z-axis rotation). Raise the pendulum to the height necessary to achieve an impact velocity of 6.9-7.1 m/s and release the pendulum. Filter the neck load cell response data at channel frequency class 600 Hz, the neck rotation data at channel frequen- cy class 60 Hz, and the pendulum acceleration data at channel frequency class 180 Hz, according to the requirements of SAE Recommended Practice J211/1, MAR 1995 (B3). The proposed requirements for the neck pendulum impact test are given in Table B1. Shoulder Impact Test Instrument the SID-lls with a linear displacement transducer for the shoulder rib. Instrument the impactor with an accelerometer whose sensitive axis is collinear to the centerline of the impactor. This test is to be conducted without the chest jacket. Seat the SID-lls upright, with its arm horizontal and its pelvis, legs and feet supported on a flat, rigid horizontal surface. Strike the dummy's shoulder laterally at 4.4-4.6 m/s with a 14 kg rigid impactor. Filter the impactor acceleration data and shoulder deflection data at channel frequency class 180 Hz, according to the requirements of SAE Recom- mended Practice J211/1, MAR 1995 (B3). The proposed requirements are a peak pendulum force between 2.6 and 3.3 kN and a peak internal deflection of the shoul- der rib between 17 and 24 mm, as shown in Table B2. Thorax Impact Test (With Arm) Instrument the thorax of the SID-lls with T1 and T12 spine accelerometers, rib accelerometers and rib linear displacement transducers. Instrument the impactor with an accelerometer whose sensitive axis is collinear to the centerline of the impactor. This test is to be conducted with a chest jacket. Seat the SID-lls upright, with its arm down and its pelvis, legs and feet supported on a flat, rigid horizontal surface. Align the center of the impactor on the center of the middle thoracic rib.

Thorax Impact Test (Without Arm) Instrument the thorax of the SID-lls with T1 and T12 spine accelerometers, rib accelerometers and rib displacement transducers. Instrument the impactor with an accelerometer whose sensitive axis is collinear to the centerline of the impactor. This test is to be conducted without the arm but with a chest jacket.

A Part-ll paper planned for 1996 will detail all the biomechanical teste as well as full scale crash test results. However, the biomechanical teste conducted to date and the results of the verification teste (based on scaled BIOSID verification teste) are shown below. Meeting the biomechanical goals of Appendix A is the main objective of the OSRP task group; meeting the Appendix B proposed verification teste is secondary. BIOMECHANICAL TESTS Head The SID-lls head was drop tested according to Head Re- sponse Target 1 in Appendix A. The scaled cadaver corri- dor is 106-158 G's. The prototype SID-lls head gives 148 G's, well within the scaled cadaver corridors. Although the rubber-like material used for Head Response Target 2 is defined by a number of specifications, the experience of the group is that different batches of elasto- mers which meet those specifications can vary widely in their impact performance. Therefore, the group preferred to evaluate the biomechanical performance of the head on the basis of the rigid surface test above. Neck At this time it was not possible to subject the SID-lls neck to sled teste. However, the group believes the SID-lls neck will closely match scaled human performance for the following reasons. Sled test results conducted during the development of the mid-male BIOSID dummy indicated that the laterally-turned mid-male Hybrid III neck closely matched human volunteer teste (Appendix A Neck Re- sponse Targets 1 and 2). The small female Hybrid III neck used for the SID-lls is a scaled Hybrid III neck. Therefore, the group is prepared to accept the SID-lls neck until sled teste can be performed. Shoulder The SID-lls shoulder was tested according to Shoulder Response Target 1, Appendix A, using a 14 kg rigid pen- dulum impactor, which struck the shoulder at 4.46 m/s. The biomechanical target deflection is 22-30 mm. The SID-lls gave 20 mm (arm down). It should be noted that 400 N of "muscle tone" was added to the shoulder design load, slightly reducing the measured deflection. Also the test velocity was on the low side of the 4.4-4.6 m/s corri- dor. The biomechanical goal for peak shoulder force as calcu- lated by the pendulum mass times its acceleration (F=ma) is 1.8-2.4 kN (Figure A1, Appendix A). The SID-lls shoul- der load averaged 2.15 kN, well within the biomechanical corridor. These results are seen in TABLE C1. Thorax Pendulum teste were conducted on the SID-lls thorax ac- cording to the requirements of Thorax Response Target 1, Appendix A, at 6.6-6.7 m/s. No teste were conducted at 4.3 m/s. The biomechanical goal for peak thorax force should be between 2.9 and 3.7 kN (Figure A4). The peak force averaged 3.58 kN, well within the desired corridor. See TABLE C2. Teste for thorax biomechanical targete 2, 3 and 4 (Appen- dix A) have not as yet been conducted. Unfortunately, it appears that the padded teste never can be conducted be- cause it does not appear feasible to replicate the large blocks of "APR padding" necessary to conduct these teste. The foam is not available through APR in France. A num- ber of foam suppliers have been contacted, but the pub- lished APR foam dynamic characteristics have not been able to be duplicated. TABLE C1.

Pelvis Pelvis Targets 1-4 have not as yet been conducted. PRELIMINARY VERIFICATION GOALS Head Scaling the BIOSID corridor (for the Hybrid III mid-adult male head) gives a corridor of 130-160 G's. The prototype SID-lls head gave 148 G's, well within the proposed corri- dor. Neck Initial neck evaluation is based on laboratory pendulum tests, with the requirements scaled from the BIOSID. When testing the neck with the laterally-turned SID-lls head, the off-center loading caused by the center of mass of the head being forward of the neck centerline, plus the off-center instrumentation, caused the neck to rotate about its z-axis. This twist caused the instrumentation to bind. Therefore, it was decided to perform the neck test as done with EUROSID-1, by using a symmetrical head mass. While a metal form is being built, the SID-lls head was used with the x-plane facing the direction of pendulum swing. Since the head is symmetrical in this plane it did not impart an off-center load to the neck. Also, the rota- tion-measuring instrumentation was placed on the slotted side of the neck to further reduce z-axis rotation. Initial tests at 6.9 m/s indicate that the peak rotation (aver- aging left and right side tests) is 86.2°, on the high end of the scaled BIOSID corridor given in TABLE B1 of Appen- dix B. However the peak neck moment was within the scaled BIOSID 48-59 N*m corridor, at 52.6 N*m. The need for further neck modification will be studied after the biomechanical tests are conducted. The test data are shown in TABLES C3 and C4. Shoulder When the SID-lls was tested according to the requirements of the Appendix B Shoulder Impact Test with arm-up, the shoulder deflection was 22 mm, within the 17-24 mm draft corridor, and shoulder force was 2.17 kN, below the scaled BIOSID 2.6-3.3 kN corridor. Test results are shown in TA- BLE C5. Clearly in this case, the biomechanical corridor is the design goal and the verification corridor undoubtedly will be revised once 10-12 production dummies are avail- able for testing. Thorax When comparing the arm-up thorax test data to the scaled BIOSID corridors, the peak force is too low. All three rib deflections are within the corridors, the rib accelerations are on the low side, and the spine accelerations are within the corridors. See TABLE C6. Since the group believes rib deflection is a very important measurement, it is encourag- ing to note the good performance to the scaled BIOSID corridors. This proposed verification corridor may be modi- fied once the remainder of the biomechanical tests are conducted. Tests have not been conducted to date with arm involvement to compare the SID-lls to the proposed requirements of TABLE B3. Abdomen Pendulum tests similar to those conducted for the thorax were conducted on the abdomen, but at 4.46 m/s as spec- ified in Appendix B. Peak force was low, but rib deflection, rib acceleration and upper and lower (T1 and T12) spine accelerations were within or extremely close to the scaled corridors. See TABLE C7. Pelvis Scaled BIOSID corridors indicate an Appendix B goal of 5.4-6.8 kN and a pelvic acceleration of 49-77 G's. The current SID-lls performance of 6.7 kN and 68.9 G's are both within the scaled corridors. Test results are shown in TABLE C8. CONCLUSION Testing to date indicates that most of the components of the SID-lls are within or very close to the biomechanical goals set for the design. The dummy has also performed very well when tested to the proposed verification corridors. Since the head and shoulder tested well to both the biomechanical and proposed verification test requirements, the group accepts these components for the beta-proto- type. The rest of the dummy will be refined as needed be- tween this first (alpha) prototype and the next beta-proto- type as needed once all the biomechanical tests have been conducted. 3239</page><page sequence="29">TABLE C3.
