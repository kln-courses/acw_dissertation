Hubbard, and Robert L. Boughner Michigan State University ABSTRACT Driver and passenger comfort, as related to automotive seats, is a growing issue in the automotive industry. As this trend continues, automotive seat designers and developers are generating a greater need for more anthropometrically accurate tools to aid them in their work. One tool being developed is the JOHN software program that utilizes three-dimensional solid objects to represent humans in seated postures. Contours have been developed to represent the outside skin sùrfaces of three different body types in a variety of postures in the sagittal plane. These body types include: the small female, the average male, and the large male. INTRODUCTION Comfort in automotive seats is an issue that has increased in interest over the past decade. Seats are being contoured to promote spinal curvature and designed with variable contours to promote movement and variation of spinal curvature and posture. Historically, seat designers have created seats mainly with templates on paper. The use of templates has become increasingly difficult in the design of highly contoured seats. Testing the seat design for comfort could not be done until a physical prototype was built. With the advent of computers and three-dimensional solid modeling programs, seat designers developed the ability to generate surface contours. If human back contours can be represented with computers, seats that fit people's contours can be designed. While not sufficient for comfort, the ability to fit seats to human contours is one of the necessary steps for creating comfortable seats. The use of computers in seat design also reduces the need for costly physical prototypes. The following paper discusses several additions that have been made by the Michigan State University Biomechanical Design Laboratory to the JOHN software program, developed using the l-DEAS solid modeling software from Structural Dynamics Research Corporation. The first addition was the improvement of the existing JOHN contours. The software program was then rewritten to allow contour generation for any amount of movement of the lumbar spine in the sagittal plane. New contours for the large male and small female were also added to the program. The JOHN program was originally introduced at the Society of Automotive Engineers International Congress in 1992 by Hubbard, et al., as paper no. 930110, titled "New Biomechanical Models for Automobile Seat Design" [1]. This paper will begin with a historical overview of the JOHN model examining four previous key developments. Each of the three new additions will then be discussed, followed by a conclusion. BACKGROUND In the early 1980's, the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) conducted an anthropometric study for crash dummy development by determining how the occupant is positioned within the automobile [2]. In their study, UMTRI placed people in a simplified model of the driver's side of an automobile and used a combination of seat surface castings and photographs of anthropometric landmarks on the subjects to determine exterior skin contour points. Anthropometric data were collected for a wide variety of individuals and they were classified and averaged into three categories: the mid-sized male [3], the small female, and the large male [4], An example of the contour data collected for the average adult male with external and internal landmarks is shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1 . UMTRI Average Male Contour In the late 1980's, Michigan State University (MSU) began developing computer models of the 1040</page><page sequence="2">human musculoskeletal system for seat design [1]. The first work at MSU was done by Haas [5], who developed a two-dimensional computer model, called JOHN, to determine the relative position of the head, thorax, and pelvis of an average human male, as shown in Figure 2. y^SKULL^ / • CERVICAL SPINE # LUMBAR SPINE HIP JOINT CENTER -n J f'L pelvis / wu j Figure 2. Two-Dimensional JOHN Computer Model The JOHN software program utilizes solid objects to represent humans in seated postures. The head, thorax, and pelvis segments in the Haas model were connected by a series of points depicting joint centers in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal regions. During this time at MSU, two anthropometric variables were defined for the JOHN model. Torso Recline Angle (TRA) is defined as the angle, measured from vertical, of the line that passes from the T12/L1 spinal joint center to the L5/S1 spinal joint center, as seen in Figure 3. The second is an internal anthropometric variable known as Total Lumbar Curvature (TLC). A back with a flat lumbar section where all the spinal joint centers are collinear is defined as TLC=0°, Figure 4. Given a reference line on the pelvis or ribcage that is parallel to the TLC=0° line, TLC can then be determined for any amount of lumbar curvature by measuring the angle between the reference line and a line passing between the T12/L1 and L5/S1 spinal joint centers, Figure 5. TLC is defined as positive when the back of the lumbar spine is concave. The next study at MSU, by Boughner [6], took the two-dimensional program of the adult male developed by Haas and created a three-dimensional solid model program, Figure 6. Boughner created models of the entire major skeletal structure using data £7) /• / • « • TRA Figure 3. Torso Recline Angle (TRA) 0 L Reference L Figure 4.

Three-Dimensional JOHN Computer Model from several anatomy texts [6,7,8] and data from the UMTRI study [3]. Boughner further refined his program by adding the ability to model leg muscle geometry and calculate hamstring length for the JOHN model. In another investigation, Bush [9] developed models of the erector spinae muscles, the muscle groups that lay directly to either side of the spinal column and external skin contours for the back of the JOHN model, Figure 7. Tissue thickness of the model was determined by examining cross-sections of cadavers presented by Koritké and Sick [10]. Bush developed skin contours for the JOHN model at discrete values of Total Lumbar Curvature (TLC), specifically at values of -10°, 0°, 10°, 20°, 30°, and 40°. Because three- dimensional renderings of the UMTRI body contours were not available at that time, Bush was limited to examining these two contours at specific points only and was not able to perform an in-depth comparison between his contours and the UMTRI contours. Figure 7. JOHN Model with Bush Contour [9] Figure 8. JOHN Model with Bush Cross-Sections [9] 1042</page><page sequence="4">METHODS REDEFINITION OF THE JOHN CONTOUR In his research, Bush performed a comparison between his contours and the contours developed by UMTRI [3]. Even though the body surface landmark data from the UMTRI study had been available for some time, without computer models Bush was limited to analyzing his data in comparison to UMTRI's at a few surface landmarks. More recently, complete three- dimensional UMTRI contours became available as computer files. With the new contour files, the complete UMTRI contour data could be analyzed on the computer at every point. To analyze the differences between the contour created by Bush and the UMTRI contour, both contours were placed over the JOHN musculoskeletal system. The UMTRI contour represents an average adult male in a single posture with a fiat lower back, or straight lumbar spine (TLC = 0°). Therefore, the UMTRI contour was compared with Bush's contour for a TLC = 0°. Cross-sections of the contours in the back region were created through each of the vertebrae down the spinal column, seen in Figure 9. Each cross- sectional plane was defined by the mid-plane between the top and bottom of each vertebrae. In the lower buttock region, the cross-sectional planes were defined as the y-z plane, also known as the vertical transverse plane, where y represents the width dimension and z is the vertical height dimension. The y-z planes were created at distances from the H-point in a range from 50 mm to -70 mm, at 20 mm increments from front to rear. In the upper buttock region the cross-sectional planes were defined by rotating the vertical transverse plane 45° about the y axis. Three sections were made at distances, measured perpendicular to the plane from the H-point, of 50, 70 and 90 mm in the rearward direction. Once the new vertebral cross-sections were created, the Bush contour line was compared to the UMTRI contour line at each cross-sectional level. In the u,.per body, sections of the back varied no more than 14 millimeters in the posterior direction and the differences between the contours in the lateral direction varied between 3 to 39 millimeters. In the lower body, or huttock region, the Bush contour and the UMTRI contour nad differences in the inferior direction ranging between 17 and 26 millimeters and lateral differences varying between 14 to 47 millimeters. New contour lines were then drawn at each vertebral level. While the UMTRI contour [3] was used as a guide to the overall size of the new contour, an attempt was made to keep the muscle and bone definition shown in Bush's contour [9], In sections where there was a large difference between the positions of the Bush and UMTRI lines, the new contour was positioned closer to the UMTRI contour while attempting to maintain the basic shape of the Bush contour. Figure 9. JOHN Model with Cross-Section Locations The approach for representing body contours had been to try to model JOHN as if the model had no deformation of the skin surface, or zero forces acting upon the body. The goal of undeformable contours was difficult to obtain because every model examined in the development of JOHN was in a deflected, seated posture. Therefore, several approximations were used to move closer to the goal. Allowances were made due to UMTRI's method of data collection ¡i.cluding using casting tape, which spanned across concave contours of the back and buttocks region. Allowances were also made for the averaging technique used by UMTRI to obtain the final contour. The avert ^ng technique used by UMTRI caused several concave regions to become less severe in their concavity. Once the new contours were defined, point coordinates along each contour line were calculated according to the reference axes of the JOHN system. Each cross-sectional line was defined by the same number of points to create fully defined vertical lines down the length of the model. The coordinates were then entered into the JOHN model. Splines were calculated for each cross-section and down each vertical line to create a wireframe mesh, Figure 10. 1043</page><page sequence="5">Figure 10. JOHN Contour Wireframe Mesh A solid object skin surface was developed from the wireframe mesh. Due to the constraints of our computing system, l-DEAS would only allow approximately 20 splines to be chosen at one time in the generation of skin contours. Not all of the splines could be chosen to create the solid. Therefore, all of the vertical splines were chosen and cross-sectional splines were only chosen at each of the following levels: 1 . Third thoracic vertebrae level (T3), 2. Eleventh thoracic vertebrae level (Tu), 3. Third contour line below the fifth lumbar vertebrae level (UB3), and 4. Seventh or lowest contour line in the lower buttocks region (LB7). The four cross-sectional splines were chosen as they are nearly equidistant along the length of the contour. The final new skin contour can be seen in Figure 11. Figure 11. The New JOHN Contour Even though more information on human contours are being developed by current research at MSU, the new contour described above is the best contour possible with the currently available data for TLC = 0°. Once the contour data comes available from MSU and other sources, the JOHN contours can be further validated and refined. The importance of having highly representative contours can not be overstated. By using better contours, seat designers can design seats to have a better fit. CREATION OF "VARIABLE" CONTOURS The second objective was to design and implement a method to create contours at any value of TLC and TRA. In the original development of contours for the JOHN average adult male by Bush [9], contours were created for six different values of TLC. While keeping the amount of TRA at a constant 35°, the JOHN model was placed at angles of TLC equal to -10°, 10°, 20°, 30°, and 40°. At each TLC value, Bush created horizontal cross-sections as he had done for the 0° TLC model. Once again, contour lines had been drawn over the modeled muscles and bones with an offset thickness. A limitation of the Bush contours was that seat designers only had the ability to evaluate seats with those six contours. If a designer wanted to design a seat for a TLC value other than one of the 10° increments, they would not be able to set the musculoskeletal model at that TLC value, but would rather have to add an overlying contour at a 10° increment nearest the TLC value. By examination of the ribcage and its skin surface, it was assumed that points on the skin surface over the thoracic and pelvic regions tend to remain in place relative to the rib cage and pelvis, respectively, over a wide range of motions in the sagittal plane. For this reason, points were attached to the rib cage, pelvis, spine, and muscles of the JOHN musculoskeletal model. These skin points would then move with those objects as JOHN'S posture changed to different values of TLC. Once the designer has set the musculoskeletal system in a preferred posture, points can then be splined through and the contours forthat exact selected posture would be created in the same manner as the 0° TLC contour. This process allows for both a systematic and repeatable method for contour generation. A new articulation program was developed based upon Boughner's program [6], in which the musculoskeletal objects and skin surface points articulate about the lumbar spinal joint centers. Once this motion is completed, the points are splined and a solid contour is generated from the splines. The program then rotates the musculoskeletal system, with the new contour, to the specified TRA and aligns the ischial tuberosities to their original position. Leg and arm motion is then manipulated at the request of the user. By allowing the contours to articulate with the musculoskeletal system, contours can be made for any degree of TLC. The seat designer no longer has to 1044</page><page sequence="6">design a seat for occupants only at TLC values of -10, 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 degrees. SMALL FEMALE AND LARGE MALE CONTOURS Even though JOHN is a useful representation of the average U.S. man, designers have the need to determine if seats will also accommodate people who are tall or short in stature, or large or small in corpulence. Due to that need, two more models were developed by MSU In addition to the JOHN model. In order to model tall, heavy men, the JERRY model was developed to represent the 95th percentile male in stature and weight. To represent small women, a 5th percentile (stature and weight) female model was developed called JANE. These models were based on studies by UMTRI [4] that established skeletal landmark locations and body contours fortall, heavy men and short, light women. The large male and small female contours were developed by scaling from the average male contour. By using the average male model as the basis, the small female contour and the large male contour would then be related in a known way, creating a basis for future models different from the 95th male, 50th male and 5th female sizes. Scaling factors were developed by examining the differences between the dimensions for the UMTRI average male and the dimensions for the UMTRI small female and large male. By examining the distances between different skeletal landmarks and comparing the related distances between the three models, scaling factors were established. The torsos of the UMTRI contours were separated into three segments: thoracic, lumbar and pelvic with different scaling factors chosen for each segment. This was done because of differences in the relative proportions of these three body segments between the male and female. Scaling factors for the thoracic region were determined by examining the distances between the following points defined by UMTRI [2], seen in Figure 12: 1 . Mesostemale to the T4 spinous process 2. Lowest (inferior) point on the right 10th Rib to the lowest (inferior) point on the left 10th Rib 3. C7 spinous process to the T 12 spinous process These distances were chosen because they lie mainly in the direction of each of the coordinate directions. The scaling factors between the points were calculated as shown below in Table 1 . The scaling factors in each of the coordinate directions were calculated by dividing the distances for the small female and the large male by the related distance of the average male. 19th Rib I / Figure 12.

It was apparent that there were postural differences between the UMTRI contours of the small female, the average male, and the large male. These differences in posture were determined by scaling the torso segments of JOHN. The scaled torso segments were then fit to the UMTRI surface landmarks of the large male and small female. The UMTRI contours showed that large men tend to slouch more than average-sized men with a -3° TLC difference between the two. The small female contour showed a 15° more erect posture (+15° TLC) relative to the average male. In order for the scaled JOHN contours to be in the orientation of the UMTRI contours, the JOHN contour was first articulated and then scaled to match the posture of the UMTRI contours. When an object or point is to be scaled in I- DEAS, two parameters are required: the scaling factor and the point from which the object or point will be scaled from. When an object or point is scaled from any single point, the scaling procedure will cause all other 1046 points to move. Because all of the points in the JOHN model were scaled from the origin, located at the H- point, each of the scaled regions required a translation to move them back into the correct position. In order to realign the newly scaled pelvic regions, the x value of the Ls spinous process point and the z value of the Inferior Tuberosity projection point were each compared to their related values in each of the three models. These values were used because it was assumed that the height of the seat surface and the depth of the seat back were well defined due to the methods used in the UMTRI study [2]. The skin points were translated to align the Ls spinous process and the Inferior Tuberosity projection. To position the newly scaled thoracic regions, it was assumed that because the C7 spinous process is a easily palpated point, the location was accurately measured by UMTRI. This point was then compared to the newly scaled C7 spinal point to determine translation values. Scaling factors for the lumbar region were determined after the both the thoracic and pelvic regions were scaled and positioned. By examining the distances between the newly positioned points of the thoracic and pelvic regions, scaling factors for the lumbar regions were established. Because each of the models had a TLC=0° posture, the points on the lumbar spinal processes are positioned in a straight line in the sagittal plane. This linearity, therefore, causes the scaling factor for the x (anterior) direction to be the same as the scaling factor for the z (superior) direction. To determine this scaling factor, the distance was calculated from the newly placed T« spinous process point to the newly placed point defining the midpoint of the top upper buttock (UB) contour line. Table 3 shows the calculated distances and the resulting scaling factors. It should be noted that these scaling factors are smaller than those for the pelvic and the thoracic regions for both the large male and the small female. This may be explained by Boughner's three-dimensional model [6], which was based upon the two-dimensional model developed by Haas [5]. Even though Haas lowered the position of the pelvis relative to the thorax from the UMTRI position for the average male, creating a longer lumbar spine in the JOHN model, the positions of the large male and small female pelvic regions were never fully examined. It is likely that the pelvises in both the UMTRI small woman and large man were also positioned too high, as was discovered for the UMTRI average man. Table 3.

I I I I Information about the y (lateral) direction in the lumbar region was not available from the UMTRI data</page><page sequence="8">because all of the points in that region lie on the mid- sagittal plane (y = 0). In the JOHN model, the points defining the skin contour in the lumbar region covers only a narrow area down the center of the spine and over the erector spinae muscles directly to each side of the vertebral column. Therefore, it was assumed that using the y scaling factor calculated for the thoracic region, Table 1, would suffice over the narrow width of the lumbar region for both the small female and the large male. The placement of the lumbar region was determined by the final placement of both the pelvic and thoracic regions. The points associated with the lumber region were rotated and translated into position by examining the position of the point associated with the T 12 spinous process and the midpoint of the top upper buttock contour. The angle of the lumbar region was determined by calculating the angle between a line drawn from the Ti2 point to the pelvic spinal point and a line in the -x (posterior) direction. Once the lumbar region was rotated to the calculated angle, the region was translated into position such that the point associated with the Ti2 spinous process was placed in its original position. Table 4 summarizes the calculated angle of the lumbar region and the amount of translation to move the region into position for both the small female and the large male. Table 4 Lumbar Translation Values JANE JERRY x (anterior) translation (mm) -22.5 -31.155 z (superior) translation (mm) | 16.6 | 5.924 Oblique views of the JANE and JERRY contours at a value of 0° TLC are shown in Figure 14. In comparing each of the new contours to the contours created by UMTRI for the small female and the large male, the respective contours match to within several millimeters of one another. Figure 15 is a front and side view of JANE's contour overlaid onto the UMTRI small female contour. The front and side view overlay of JERRY'S contour with the UMTRI large male is seen in Figure 16. Each of the new contours of JANE and JERRY are representative of the size and shape of the small female and the large male and each maintain muscle and bone definition throughout the contour. The JANE and JERRY contours can also be articulated into any degree of TLC and TRA, as their contours are based upon surface points as in the JOHN contour. By scaling the contours of JANE and JERRY from the JOHN contour, each contour is now related to the other. The seat designer now has the ability to model seats for not just the average male, but can design seats that fit a larger array of occupant sizes. Figure 14. JANE and JERRY Contours Figure 15. Comparison of JANE and UMTRI Contours Figure 16. Comparison of JERRY and UMTRI Contours CONCLUSION The external contour of the JOHN model was reconfigured to be a more anatomically representative model of an undeflected skin surface. The new contour was developed using the contour created by Bush [9] and from studies done by UMTRI [2,3], The new JOHN contour, which is partially based on the UMTRI average male contour, has a more representative size but also retains the muscle and bone definition noted in Bush's model. A contour articulation program for each of the adult skeletal models was created. The external contours of the small female, the average male, and the large male can now be articulated in the sagittal plane to 1047</page><page sequence="9">any value of TLC and TRA to follow the underlying musculoskeletal systems. External contours for both the small female and the large male were developed from the JOHN average male model. Both of the JANE and the JERRY contours are scaled from the JOHN contour, thus making all of the contours related to each other. With a more representative size and definition for the model, the designer will be able to use the model to create seats that fit the occupant better. Being able to use contours at any value of TLC and TRA, the designer will be able to fit occupants in seats in a larger variety of postures. By allowing the designers to model not only the average male but also the small female and the large male, he or she can design a seat that will fit a larger segment of the population. Fit, while it is by no means the sole component, is one of the most important elements to designing comfortable seats. If seat design tools, like the JOHN family of models, can better represent how a large variety of people fit in seats in different positions, seats designed with those tools should be more comfortable.
