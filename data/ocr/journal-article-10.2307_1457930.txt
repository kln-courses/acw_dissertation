New Haven: The Ameri- can Schools of Oriental Research, 1951. 60 pp. A translation and annotation of 11 columns of DSD. Over 500 notes are included, many of them dealing with the affinities of DSD to the other Dead Sea scrolls and the Damascus Document, as well as to the 0. T. and the Apocrypha. Burrows, Millar, J. C. Trever, and W. H. Brown- lee, The Dead Sea Scrolls of St. Mark's Monastery. Vol. I: The Isaiah Manuscript and the Habakkuk Commentary. Vol. II, Fasc. 2: Plates and Tran- scriptions of the Manual of Discipline. New Haven: The American Schools of Oriental Research, 1950-51. xxiv pp., 61 plates and transcriptions; 11 plates and transcriptions. The first volume contains a short introduction on the discovery of the scrolls by Burrows, introductions to the Isaiah scroll and the Habakkuk commentary by Trever and Brown- lee respectively, a brief note on the palaeography of the scrolls by Trever, and photographs of the scrolls; volume II, fascicle 2, photographs and transcriptions alone. Driver, G. R., The Hebrew Scrolls from the Neighbourhood of Jericho and the Dead Sea. Friends of Dr. Williams's Library, Lecture 4, 1950. Oxford: The Oxford University Press, 1951. 52 pp. A full statement of the author's case against a pre-Chris- tian or early dating of the Dead Sea scrolls, using orthographic and linguistic methods and challeng- ing the customary use made of the archaeological evidence. Driver argues for ca. 500 A. D. as the terminus post quem for the scrolls. Dupont-Sommer, A., The Dead Sea Scrolls: A Preliminary Survey. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1952. 100 pp., 10 plates, and 1 map. An account of the finding of the scrolls and an attempt to connect them with the Essenes. Conjectures are made as to pos- sible reinterpretations of O. T. materials in the light of the new discoveries. Fischer, B. (ed.), Vetus Latina: die Reste der Altlateinischen Bibel. Freiburg: Herder, 1951. 33*, 151 pp. This second fascicle includes an introduction in which the classification of the sources and the method of the work are presented, and the LXX and the Latin text in several recensions of Gen. i.l-ix.14, with a vast collection of variant readings. Gehman, H. S., "The Hebrew Character of Sep- tuagint Greek" VT, Vol. 1, 1951, 81-90. A dis- cussion of the peculiar character of the LXX koine, in which it is called "Jewish-Greek". Both syntax and vocabulary are cited with many illustrations. Gleave, H. C., The Ethiopic Version of the Song of Songs. London: Taylor's Foreign Press, 1951. xxxii + 42 pp. The Ethiopic text with a full ap- paratus criticus and an English translation of the Song of Songs, as well as an introduction dealing with previous editions, available manuscripts, etc. Kahle, Paul, Die hebriiischen Handschriften aus der Hiihle. Stuttgart: W. Kohlhammer Verlag, 1951. 92 pp. The author argues for a second cen- tury A. D. date for both Isaiah scrolls, discusses the various types of texts in these MSS., and holds that the Habakkuk Commentary must be dated before A. D. 70. Katz, Peter, Philo's Bible: The Aberrant Text of Bible Quotations in Some Philonic Writings and Its Place in the Textual History of the Greek Bible. Cambridge: The University Press, 1950. xii + 162 pp. Katz' thesis is that the Philonic quotations not conforming to the Septuagint are for the most part taken from a now-lost Pentateuch Septuagint re- cension, and are inserted in Philo by a later hand. Roberts, B. J. The Old Testament Text and Ver- sions: The Hebrew Text in Transmission and the 187</page><page sequence="2">188 RESEARCH ABSTRACTS History of the Ancient Versions. Cardiff: Univer- sity of Wales Press, 1951. 326 pp. A valuable hand- book on the text and versions of the 0. T., much fuller than anything hitherto available. Soisalon-Soininen, I., Die Textformen der Septu- aginta-Ubersetzung des Richterbuches. Annales Ac- ademiae Scientiarum Fennicae, B. 72: 1. Helsinki: Druckerei-A. G. der finnischen Literaturgesell- schaft, 1951. 124 pp. The author holds that the great divergency between Alexandrinus and Vati- canus in this book points to two recensions of one and the same translation, and claims that due to the peculiar history of the LXX the restoration of the original text-form is impossible. II. Philology Brown, Francis, S. R. Driver, and C. A. Briggs, Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament. Corrected Impression. Oxford: The Oxford Uni- versity Press, 1952. xix + 1126 pp. A reprint of the invaluable Oxford lexicon, with eight pages of "Addenda et Corrigenda" compiled by G. R. Driver. These are marked in the text with asterisks. Coates, J. R. (ed. and trans.), Bible Key Words from Gerhard Kittel's Theologisches W irterbuch zum Neuen Testament. New York: Harpers, 1951. A one-volume edition containing Love by Quell and Stauffer, The Church by Schmidt, Sin by Quell, Bertram, Stiihlin, and Grundmann, and Righteous- ness by Quell and Schrenk. Koehler, Ludwig, Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros. Lief. vi-xi. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1950-52. Continuing the Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic lexi- con of the Old Testament, now completed through 'al. Koehler is the editor of the Hebrew section, and Walter Baumgartner is the editor of the Aramaic section. Young, G. D., Grammar of the the Hebrew Lan- guage. Grand Rapids: Zondervan Publishing House, 1951. 214 pp. The author uses the method of introducing students to the text in transliteration at the very beginning, and only later using the He- brew script. He claims that the student can best master the Hebrew verb with the analytical charts which he provides, although the traditional para- digms are also included. III. Introductory Works Anderson, Bernhard W., Rediscovering the Bible. New York: Association Press, 1951. 267 pp. An excellent introduction to the Bible for college stu- dent and layman, inasmuch as it assumes the major critical results of modern Biblical scholarship but holds to the central conception of revelation through history. More than half of the book is devoted to the Old Testament. Anderson writes in a refresh- ing, non-technical style and always in reference to the questioning modern mind. Bentzen, Aage, Introduction to the Old Testa- ment. Second edition. Copenhagen: G. E. C. Gad, 1952. 2 Vols. in one binding. 268, 300 pp. and ap- pendix of 30 pp. The new features of the second edi- tion are the single binding and the appendix which is primarily in the nature of a bibliographical survey of recent research. This remains the best work in English with respect to the Old Testament literary types, but, in consequence, the discussion of indi- vidual books is often shockingly brief. Lods, Adolphe, Histoire de la Litterature HI- braique et Juive. Paris: Payot, 1950. 1054 pp. This posthumous literary history by the great French Protestant scholar deserves a place along- side the standard works of Bewer in English and Hempel in German. Lods treats the literature chronologically down to 135 A.D. Rypins, Stanley, The Book of Thirty Centuries: An Introduction to Modern Study of the Bible. New York: The Macmillan Co., 1951. 420 pp. For one not schooled in the Biblical disciplines, the au- thor shows wide familiarity with the materials and findings of modern Biblical science. Text and trans- lation receive major emphasis, with an interesting summary of higher criticism. Excellent documen- tation with several useful tables of textual data. Sellin, Ernst and Leonhard Rost, Einleitung in das Alte Testament. Eighth edition. Heidelberg: Qelle und Meyer, 1950. 198 pp. Sellin's brief in- troduction, popular among German theological stu- dents, has been revised by Rost. Besides being brought abreast of current scholarship in many de- tails, a section on Gattungforschung has been added. IV. Exegesis Albright, William F., "A Catalogue of Early He- brew Lyric Poems (Psalm 68)," (HUCA, Vol. 23, 1950-51, 1-39). The disorder and primitive traits long apparent in Psalm 68 are explained on the theory that the psalm is a collection of at least thirty incipits (hymn beginnings). Bfright, John, "The Date of the Prose Sermons of Jeremiah" (JBL, Vol. 70, 1951, 15-35). Bright ar- gues that the prose sermons, far from being the in- vention of a later Deuteronomist, are essentially the product of Jeremiah although not likely the ipsis- sima verba of the prophet. Das Alte Testament Deutsch, Volkmar Hern- trich and Artur Weiser (eds.), Gdttingen: Van- denhoeck &amp; Ruprecht. This commentary series, of such a uniformly high quality, has been furthered by the publication of Die Psalmen (1950), Das Buch Hiob (1951), Das Buch des Propheten Jeremia Kap. 1-25:13 (1952) all by Artur rWeiser, and Der</page><page sequence="3">RESEARCH ABSTRACTS 189 Prophet Jesaja Kap. 1-12 (1950) by Hentrich, and Das erste Buch Mose 12:10-25:18 (1952) by von Rad. Frost, Stanley, Old Testament Apocalyptic. Its Origins and Growth. London: The Epworth Press, 1952. 270 pp. A treatment of the formal charac- teristics and content of apocalyptic, its historical de- velopment, and representative apocalypses from Eze- kiel to the Books of Enoch. Ginsberg, H. L., Studies in Koheleth. Texts and Studies of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, Vol. 17, 1950. 46 pp. These short studies in Ecclesiastes are typical of the author's acumen and forcefulness in argument. Gordis, Robert, Koheleth-The Man and His World. Texts and Studies of the Jewish Theolog- ical Seminary of America, Vol. 19, 1950. 396 pp. The author's long acquaintance with and study of Koheleth (as witnessed by several journal articles and a smaller book) make this well-written com- mentary abundantly worth reading. Howie, Carl G., The Date and Composition of Ezekiel. Journal of Biblical Literature Monograph Series, Vol. 4, 1950. 121 pp. The conclusions, which in the main support the traditional view of Ezekiel's sixth century Babylonian provenance, should not blind the reader to the independent nature of the study. At every point there is evidence of firsthand research-a virtue especially clear in the use of lin- guistic and archaeological data. Kraus, Hans-Joachim, Die Konigsherrschaft Gottes im Alten Testament. Tiibingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1951. 155 pp. Kraus critically surveys ear- lier work on the subject but presents independent conclusions. In the Psalter he distinguishes between preexilic royal Zion festival lyrics which commemo- rate Yahweh's election of Zion and David and post- exilic enthronement hymns patterned on the Baby- lonian Marduk procession but eschatological in con- tent. Lindblom, Johannes, The Servant Songs in Deu- tero-Isaiah. Lund: C. W. K. Gleerup, 1951. 104 pp. Starting from an analysis of their literary character, Lindblom concludes that the Servant Songs belong to the genuine writings of Second Isaiah and that they picture an individual who allegorically repre- sents the community. Montgomery, James, A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Books of Kings. International Critical Commentary. Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1951. 575 pp. This work has been hailed as the ma- jor commentary to appear in perhaps a decade and is by far the best work on Kings in English, if not in any language. Neher, Andre, Amos. Contribution a l'etude du prophetisme. Paris: Librairie Philosophique J. Vrin, 1950. 299 pp. The scope, organization and outlook of this volume makes it almost unique in Old Testament studies. Neher ambitiously under- takes to write a commentary on Amos and to dis- cuss the nature of Hebrew prophecy. There is an interesting chapter on the metaphysical significance of prophecy, especially in relation to time. Paterson, John, The Praises of Israel. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1950. 256 pp. Di- rected toward the minister, Paterson stresses the religious values and teachings of the Psalter with cohsiderable attention to the modern vogue of lit- urgy and Gattungkritik. Rignell, Lars, Die Nachtgesichte des Sacharja. Lund: Ohlsson, 1950. 268 pp. The exegetically troublesome "night visions" of Zechariah 1:7-6:15 are here interpreted as a literary unity. The prophet has joined together the oracular prophecies and the eight visions by means of various explanatory sen- tences. This accounts for their composite appear- ance. Rowley, H. H. (ed.), Studies in Old Testament Prophecy. Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1950. 206 pp. These thirteen essays by members of the British Society for Old Testament Study were presented to T. H. Robinson on his 65th birthday and the volume closes with a bibliography of that noted scholar's prolific writings. Simon, Marcel, "La prophetie de Nathan et le Temple" (RHPR, Vol. 22, 1952, 41-58). The temple prophecy of Nathan in II Sam. 7 receives careful historical and exegetical analysis with the result that it is judged essentially authentic. Terrien, Samuel, The Psalms and their Meaning for Today. New York: Bobbs-Merrill Co., 1952. 278 pp. The book is popular but never trivial for the author has a clear grasp of the central Hebrew veri- ties which again and again find expression in and lend vitality to the Psalms. Wright, G. Ernst, "Recent European Study in the Pentateuch" (JBR, Vol. 18, 1950, 216-225). The article reports and evaluates recent form critical re- search in the Pentateuch as represented by von Rad and Noth. V. Theology Boman, Thorleif, Das hebriiische Denken im Vergleich mit dem Griechischen. G6ttingen: Van- denhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1952. 186 pp. A searching inquiry into the relation between Greek and Hebrew forms and manner of thought-a connection which is rightly recognized as a central consideration in any statement of the essence of Christianity. Such basic categories as the dynamic and static, space and time, logic and psychology are treated with an un- canny ability for raising the right issues. Dentan, Robert C., Preface to Old Testament Theology. Yale Studies in Religion, No. 14, 1950.</page><page sequence="4">190 RESEARCH ABSTRACTS 74 pp. One of the more serious approaches to the problem of Old Testament theology to appear in recent years. The history of the subject alone is worth the price of the booklet, but, in addition, the author attempts to state the nature, function, scope and method of Old Testament theology. Many will disagree with his formulations but the clarity and freshness of the study make it indispensable for all who would understand the discipline. Eichrodt, Walther, Man in the Old Testament. Studies in Biblical Theology No. 4. London: S. C. M. Press, 1951. This is by all odds the most pene- trating and provocative statement of Hebrew an- thropology to appear in years. Hartlich, Christian and Walter Sachs, Der Ur- sprung des Mythosbegriffes in der Modernen, Bibel- wissenschaft. Tiibingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1952. 191 pp. Here is a book much needed in the present furor over ",de-mythologizing" the Scriptures. The authors devote all but seventeen pages to an histori- cal survey of the many conceptions of myth devel- oped and applied to both Testaments since the eighteenth century. Heinisch, Paul, Theology of the Old Testament. Collegeville, Minn.: Liturgical Press, 1950. 386 pp. This translation makes available in English the work of the foremost living Roman Catholic author in the Old Testament field. His resolution of the tension between history of religion and theology is much too artificial, but the study is thorough and at times brilliant in its exposition. Superb topical bib- liography. Michaeli, F., Dieu a l'image de l'Homme. Neu- chatel: Delachaux et Niestle, 1950. 173 pp. A use- ful study of anthropomorphism and anthropopathism in the Old Testament, showing how the Hebrews reconciled the tendency toward crass realism in their description of God with a moral view of the deity. Mowinckel, Sigmund, Hans som Kommer. Ko- penhagen: G. E. C. Gad, 1951. 417 pp. It is hoped that this comprehensive handbook on Messianic ideas will soon be available either in German or English. Noth, Martin, "History and the Word of God in the Old Testament" (BIRL, Vol. 32, 1950, 194- 206). This remarkable essay begins with the cita- tion of three Mari texts which Noth believes indi- cate the origins of Hebrew prophecy as a formal institution. He then raises in the most crucial man- ner the problem of the relation between the history of Old Testament religion (which is not uniquely Israelite) and the Word of God (which is decisive and unique). Procksch, Otto, Theologice des Alten Testaments. Giitersloh: C. Bertelsmann, 1950. 787 pp. Pub- lished posthumously, this work represents the crowning achievement of Procksch and deserves a close second to the great Old Testament theology of Eichrodt. Writing in clear German, the author seeks to do justice to the transient and the perma- nent in Hebrew faith. Rad, Gerhard von, Der Heilige Krieg im alten Israel. Zurich: Zwingli-Verlag, 1951. 84 pp. Von Rad elucidates the meaning of holy war in old Is- rael, its gradual secularization and professionalizing, and its religious reinterpretation in the prophets and Deuteronomy. Schilling, Othmar, Der Jenseitsgedanke im Alten Testament. Mainz: Rheingold-Verlag, 1951. 135 pp. This Roman Catholic treatise is avowedly writ- ten to present Hebrew-Jewish ideas of the after-life in terms of distinctly Biblical development rather than within the framework of religionsgeschichte which has dominated most studies on the subject in the last century. Smith, C. Ryder, The Bible Doctrine of Man. London: The Epworth Press, 1951. 274 pp. Smith reserves the first 130 pages for an exposition of the Old Testament and Septuagintal teaching on man. The discussion is elementary and is chiefly useful as a summary of generally admitted findings in the area of Biblical psychology, anthropology and the- ology. Wright, G. Ernst, God Who Acts. Biblical The- ology as Recital. Studies in Biblical Theology No. 8. London: S. C. M. Press, 1952. 132 pp. A timely and acute statement on the problem of giving theo- logical formulation to the basic content of Hebrew- Christian faith with all of its historical variety-a variety which is not accidental but essential. The writer finds the answer in the Biblical confessional recital of what God has done in history. At times the spirit of the book is overly polemical but what makes it of such value is the great seriousness with which the Biblical message is regarded and the con- stant reference to the contemporary scene in Chris- tendom. VI. History Abel, F. M., Histoire de la Palestine depuis la conquete d'Alexandre jusqu'" l'invasion arabe. 2 Tomes. Paris: Gabalda, 1952. xvi + 506 pp.; x + 406 pp. A historical and political study comple- menting and completing the author's Geographie de la Palestine. Hitti, P.

A hand- book giving in broad sweep an account of the his- tory and culture of the ancient Near East from its beginnings to the end of the sixth century. Meek, T. J., Hebrew Origins. New York: Har- pers, 1950. xvi + 246 pp. A revised edition of Meek's famous work, completely rewritten, with modifications and further documentation of the po- sitions of the first edition. Noth, Martin, Geschichte Israels. G6ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1950. viii + 395 pp. A monumental work showing the influence of Noth's studies in Formgeschichte. Rowley, H. H., From Joseph to Joshua: Biblical Traditions in the Light of Archaeology. The Schweich Lectures of the British Academy 1948. London: The Oxford University Press, 1950. xii + 200 pp. A fresh, thorough discussion of some of the most difficult historical questions: the exodus, the sojourn, and the conquest. Rowley dates Abra- ham in the time of Hammurabi, the conquest by the southern tribes in the Amarna age, Joseph in the reign of Ikhnaton, and the exodus proper at the be- ginning of the reign of Mernephthah. VII. Miscellaneous Baumgartner, Walter, Otto Eissfeldt, et al. (eds.), Festschrift fiir Alfred Bertholet zum 80. Geburtstag. Tiibingen: J. C. B. Mohr (Paul Sie- beck), 1950. viii + 578 pp. Containing articles on linguistics and textual criticism, interpretations of specific passages, Hebrew poetic form, general is- sues in the field of religion and theology, the science of religion, the nature of myth, general trends in O.

Brill, 1950. 272 pp. More than half of this volume is taken up with a study of the text of Zech. ix-xiv by T. Jansma, in which a full collation of the witness of the ancient versions is to be found. Other articles are by G. J. Thierry on various Hebraic problems, particularly the origin of the hiph'il; M. David, denying any connection between the Code of Hammurabi and the laws in Exodus; J. Simons on Manasseh's wall in Jerusalem; Th. C. Vriezen on the ritual of sprin- kling; and J. van der Ploeg, holding that the "poor" in Israel are the "humble before God." All articles except the last are in English. De Boer, P. A. H. (ed.), Oudtestamentische Studidn. Deel VIII. Leiden: E. J.
