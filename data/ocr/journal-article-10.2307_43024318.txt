<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAUL T. BRYANT Radford University Echoes, Allusions, and "Reality" in Hayduke Lives ! Hayduke Lives!, Edward Abbey's last novel, is an apparently simple but actually complex amalgam of social satire, environmental protest, antic language, ironic ambiguities, and playful fantasy. Outrage is mixed with absurdity; profound archetypes are intertwined with the most trivially comic ; idealism and cynicism travel arm in arm ; soaring poetic language crashes repeatedly into the rubble of egregious puns; the most absolute conviction in belief and behavior is constantly undermined by the ever- present narrative voice of an authorial figure who may be sympathetic but remains detached, an observer who is always interested, sometimes fasci- nated, but never totally committed. Every character in the novel, every group, every viewpoint, every idea carries within itself the deliberately planted seeds of its own deconstruction. Everything except nature itself is called into question. Constantly the text reminds the reader that it is text - language - a verbal construct drawn from and resting on a long, well established, always self-conscious literary tradition. By clearly stating, from the title itself onward, that this novel is a sequel, and by again presenting Jack Burns, a figure in so many of his novels, Abbey builds all of his own previous works of fiction into that tradition, but the insistence on the text as conscious literary construct is even more pervasive, depending quite openly on asso- ciations with a wide range of other texts. This continuous, often ironic,</page><page sequence="2">312 Western American Literature sometimes obtrusive insistence on textual echoes and allusions does much to set the tone and determine the effects of H ay duke Lives! . All of the major figures of the novel - Doc Sarvis, Bonnie Abbzug- Sarvis, Seldom Seen Smith, Jack Burns, Bishop Love, Hayduke himself, and the others - are carefully kept from becoming the fully developed, well rounded characters one would expect in "realistic" fiction. They are kept just across the line into caricature, reminding us constantly that we are dealing with a "mythical" story. This approach is especially effective for Abbey's subject (what Henry James would call his donn√©e) because the actuality of environmental conflicts in the modern American West is often so extreme that caricature is difficult if not impossible. How, for example, could Abbey have caricatured a James Watt? What could he have over- stated about the Exxon Valdez? As a literary artist, Abbey was confronted with the challenge of a subject in which hyperbolic exaggeration to the point of absurdity could become, overnight, mere reportage. In an earlier paper, "Edward Abbey and Environmental Quixo- ticism," I have tried to show, among other things, that Abbey is an environ- mental moderate whose fiction has drawn heavily on the literary tradition of Don Quixote, as well as the popular tradition of the Lone Ranger. In Hayduke Lives!, the Quixotic figure of Jack Burns again appears, a thin, aged man riding a tall, bony horse and living by an apparently outdated, idealized vision of the world, mixing the absurd with the heroic. The only direct reference to the old Spanish knight errant, however, is the comment on Doc Sarvis's "quixotic opposition" to the activities of large corpora- tions ( 169) . Direct allusion to Don Quixote has yielded, in this final novel, to a clearly stated association with the Lone Ranger. The literary classic, in this instance, has yielded to popular culture, but the clear - indeed insisted upon - connection through allusion continues. And the poignant mixture of nobility and absurdity is present from Burns's first appearance. His horse is an old gelding, off-white, with "mangy patches on flank and shoulder, feet like frying pans, one loose shoe, a Roman nose, long and yellow teeth," a distant approximation of the famous Silver, the "fiery horse with the speed of light," much diminished by age. Jack Burns suffers, too, in the passage of time: The man seated on the sagging middle of the horse's back wore wrinkled darkblue riding pants smeared with bacon grease on thigh and hip, high boots with rusty spurs, a dirty baggy once-white shirt of weird design (no collar, double row of buttons up the front) , the dusty black scarf (of anarchism?) tied about the neck, dirty white</page><page sequence="3">Paul T. Bryant 313 gloves with high gauntlets, and a dirty white ten-gallon comical hat with four-inch brim. (27) This time-eroded echo of a mythic hero of popular culture carries the required twin six-shooters ( .44 magnum Rugers) and, in place of the black mask, Ray-Ban sunglasses. Again, as in Abbey's earlier fiction, his Lone Ranger has only one eye - the monocular vision of the anarchist (Bryant 40-41 ) . He is presented as a comic rather than cosmic heroic figure: In any case, he merely sat there on his withered hams, in his worn saddle, on his worn-out horse, doing nothing practical or useful. Only watching, waiting, listening, making a fool of himself, because he was the scout. (27) Nevertheless, the mythic quality of the figure, however grotesque or out of date, is insisted upon. When "the Ranger" takes his leave of the group near the end of the novel, "They turned together, man and horse, one animal, one centaur, one creation out of myth by history, and trotted away into the night" (291). Less openly insisted upon in the text, but perhaps as pervasive as the figure of the Lone Ranger, are the allusions to Steinbeck's T he Grapes of Wrath . The desert tortoise with which Abbey's last novel opens and closes offers obvious parallels with Steinbeck's "land turtle," introduced in Chap- ter Three of Grapes . Steinbeck's tortoise is presented first approaching and crossing a highway: . . . over the grass at the roadside a land turtle crawled, turning aside for nothing, dragging his high-domed shell over the grass. His hard legs and yellow-nailed feet threshed slowly through the grass. . . . His horny beak was partly open, and his fierce, humorous eyes, under brows like fingernails, stared straight ahead. (20) Abbey's desert tortoise has "small wise droll redrimmed eyes" and he walks on "long leathery legs, fully extended from the walnut colored hump of shell" (3). Humorous eyes and droll eyes, hard legs and leathery legs, high-domed shell and hump of shell, the two tortoises have similar functions in the two novels. Steinbeck's tortoise is introduced in an "interchapter," a short chapter of its own, a frequently anthologized example of "realistic" description (Lisca 733), but of course its significance carries far beyond that to function as an early symbolic representation of the single-minded indomitability of the common people. "Nobody can't keep a turtle though," Jim Casy observes. "They work at it and work at it, and at last one day they get out and away they go" (28) .</page><page sequence="4">314 Western American Literature Abbey's desert tortoise opens and closes Hayduke Lives!, presenting an image of the indomit ability not of humanity, but rather of "nature" in the face of destructive, mechanical human activity. Instead of an "inter- chapter" within the stream of the narrative, Abbey's presentation of the desert tortoise is used to frame the novel, introducing the contrast between the giant earthmoving machine, GOLIATH, and abiding wild creatures at the beginning of the novel, and then suggesting the endurance of wild nature after GOLIATH has been destroyed at the end of the novel. "GOLIATH," Abbey says at the end of the opening chapter, "is a patient monster," but, "Only a turtle, not the largest but the longest-living of any land animal, could be more patient" (7). Just as Steinbeck's land turtle, finally released from Tom Joad's coat, again sets out southwestward, the direction in which it had been going originally, so Abbey's desert tortoise, at the close of the novel, after finally digging itself out of its burial by a bull- dozer, "lifts his head high on its wrinkled neck and takes off, marching towards the invincible sunrise" ( 307-308 ) . The scene is shared only by the immortal Jack Burns. Other parallels with The Grapes of Wrath also appear. In both novels the humans who operate the great destructive inhuman (inhumane) machines are depicted as being isolated from the natural world, dehuman- ized, mere operating parts of the machine. They are shown almost as if they are controlled by, rather than being controllers of, the machine, because ultimately "the machine" is not just a concatenation of metal and energy, but rather a whole social and economic system of which the physical machine is merely an expression. For example, here is Steinbeck's presenta- tion of the tractor driver who has replaced the farm families in Grapes of Wrath : The man sitting in the iron seat did not look like a man ; gloved, goggled, rubber dust mask over nose and mouth, he was a part of the monster, a robot in the seat. The thunder of the cylinders sounded through the country, became one with the air and the earth, so that earth and air muttered in sympathetic vibration. The driver could not control it - . ... (48) Similarly, Abbey's bulldozer operator: "A dim anthropomorph, hel- meted, masked and goggled, fixed in place under a canopy of steel, attached by gloved forelimbs to a pair of levers, moves jerkily half-blindly inside the fog of dust, one small component of a great machine ..." (6). Then Seldom Seen Smith's nightmare vision of GOLIATH, in Chapter 9, again presents a machine operator as a now dispensable and helpless part of the</page><page sequence="5">Paul T. Bryant 315 machine, "a semi-human figure strapped to a contoured plastic seat inside the control cab," with "hands attached by rivets to the self-adapting control levers" (66). These parallels between Hayduke and Grapes easily suggest themselves to the reader familiar with both works, but in case there is some doubt that they are conscious, intentional, and meant to be noticed, Abbey inserts a variation of a classic country joke that appeared in The Grapes of Wrath . In Steinbeck's version, Willy Feeley has taken his heifer to the Graves's bull, to find only young Elsie Graves at home. Willy is embarrassed about his errand, but Elsie is not: Elsie says, "I know what you come for: the bull's out back a the barn." Well, they took the heifer out there an' Willy and Elsie sat on the fence to watch. Purty soon Willy got feelin' purty fly. Elsie looks over an' says, like she don't know, "What's the matter, Willy?" Willy's so randy he can't hardly set still. "By God," he says, "by God, I wisht I was a-doin' that!" Elsie says. "Why not, Willy? It's your heifer." (94) Abbey's version of the joke uses bulldozers rather than a bull, but the echo of Steinbeck is unmistakable. Hayduke has just dueled Bishop Love with bulldozers. The result has been that both dozers have gone over the rim to destruction, leaving both drivers to jump for their lives. Afterward the Bishop walks with BLM Ranger Virginia Dick, his soon-to-be second wife, to the rim to survey the ruins of his expensive machines : Approximately ninety feet below the two bulldozers lay, belly to belly, like copulating lovers. Treads untracked, blades twisted, inter- nal organs dangling, quietly burning in the shade of the drop-off within the generalized desert stillness. . . . Bishop Love gazed down at his smoldering machines, the bigger one sprawled upon the slightly smaller one. He turned a sly shy smirking grin upon Virginia. "Wish I was doing that." She caught his meaning. "Well go ahead, Dudley, they're your bulldozers." (95-96) The other extended association with an established literary master- piece, not so overt as with The Grapes of Wrath , is the echo, in the "Col- onel" who relentlessly pursues Hayduke, of Inspector Javert of Victor Hugo's Les Miserables . Both Javert and the Colonel are dedicated, unswerving, a nemesis lurking always in the dark background as the central figure of each novel follows his course. Both are plagued by the incompe- tence of underlings. Both are pursuing men of uncommon physical strength.</page><page sequence="6">316 Western A merican Literature And both, finally, on the verge of successfully arresting their quarry, draw back from doing so, choosing to take their own lives, instead. Why does Abbey incorporate these echoes and allusions? I will explore some broader reasons later, but for these two novels one might observe that they are both essentially "proletarian" in viewpoint. They attack the "Establishment" and decry the fate of the poor and the dispossessed at the hands of the rich and the powerful. They deal with those who are outside the pale, beyond the law. These people relate well to the etymology Abbey supplies for Hayduke's name: from the Hungarian Heiduk, meaning beyond the wall - an outlaw (169). George Washington Hayduke, Tom Joad, and Jean Valjean would probably have understood each other well. These allusions to other novels also fit into the broader pattern, already mentioned, of constantly reminding us that this is, after all, only a literary text, not reality or even an attempt to represent reality. The text is riddled with random allusions to other writings - not all of them literary - as well as puns, double visions, and ambiguities. Even the authorial voice that ostensibly presents the text is made ironically ambiguous and, in its implied relationship with the figure of the "literary journalist," (82ff.) slightly ridiculous. Nothing finally escapes a chuckle. The whimsical inconsistency of the authorial voice is established almost immediately at the opening of the novel. On page three (the first page of text) : "The ancient Greeks thought the tortoise a kind of demon. So much for the Greeks. An ignorant people." On the very next page: "Appearance is reality, said a wise man, Epicurus" (4) . So much for the previous page's dismissal of the Greeks. Authorial whimsy is introduced not only in wordplay, but by other means as well. A prominent example is Hayduke's use of literary names in his frequent pseudonyms. Hayduke is hardly one who might be expected commonly to use - or even to know - literary allusions, yet when he bombs the uranium processing plant he calls himself Casper Goodwood (72).1 To be sure the reader does not miss the connection, we learn later that he listed his next of kin as Henry James. To make doubly sure we (and by "we" I mean such literati as would be reading this paper) know that he knows that we know, Abbey has Hayduke suggest the old debate over James's sexual orientation by listing him as having died of AIDS - in 1916 ( 78) . The authorial voice is clear here, in that Henry James is much more a matter of knowledge and interest for Edward Abbey than for George Washington Hayduke.</page><page sequence="7">Paul T. Bryant 317 Later, Hayduke claims to have found his false names in a telephone book, and then rattles off a list of examples: Eugene Gant, Casper Good- wood, Daisy Miller, Julien Sorel ( 109) . Again the voice seems better to fit the author, or the "literary journalist" of the novel, than it does Hayduke the anarchist. Again we are reminded that the author is continually joking with us. The joking extends to seemingly endless literary and cultural echoes from other books. A few examples from a list that is certainly not exhaus- tive: "Rattlesnakes in the grass, alas, and zero at the bone" (43), suggests, in a single sentence, both Gertrude Stein's "Pigeons in the grass alas," from "Four Saints in Three Acts" (533), and Emily Dickinson's poetic image of a snake, that "narrow Fellow in the Grass" that brings on "a tighter breathing / And Zero at the Bone" (Poem 986) . Is Abbey suggesting that Bonnie, Doc, Seldom and Hayduke are four saints? The connection seems ironic and tenuous at best. Is he proposing the Freudian fear of sexuality sometimes attributed to Dickinson's poem? It doesn't fit those four. Abbey reinforces the Stein echo in the same paragraph by having Bonnie say to herself, in her reverie at little Reuben's crib, "We're getting paranoid as pigeons" (44) .2 Perhaps he wants to make sure that we caught the allusion, or perhaps he wants to assure us that it was intended. When Bonnie Abbzug-Sarvis is caught in a pothole without a rope with which to climb out, she shouts for help and at first gets no answer. At such a moment, one would not expect to encounter an echo of Stephen Crane, but there it is: "The only answer anyone ever got, appealing to the sky" ( 159) . In Crane's "The Open Boat," "None of them knew the color of the sky" ( 68 ) , but when they appeal to it, "A high cold star on a winter's night" is the only answer they get ( 85 ) . Even Kipling gets his turn when, in response to the Lone Ranger's admiration of Erika, Hayduke pulls out a cigar and answers, "A woman's only a woman. ... A good cigar is a smoke," lines straight from Kipling's poem, "The Betrothed." One might speculate that Abbey has us on our way to another aca- demic cottage industry like that developed for searching out all possible allusions and symbolic meanings in Finne gan' s Wake : Is, for example, the cigar a phallic symbol suggesting that Kipling, and Hayduke, are homo- sexual? I do not believe Abbey intended his allusions to bear such weight. These are playful free associations and echoes of words and perhaps images, but not so profoundly of underlying symbols and ideas. This is text calling attention to the literary nature of its textuality.</page><page sequence="8">318 Western A merican Literature Not all of these echoes and word-plays are literary, however. In the first interview of J. Oral Hatch by the "Colonel" and his helpers, we see a motel room television set, turned on, but showing only snow: "An electronic snowstorm, a blithering whirligig of mesons, photons, neutrons and neu- trinos, a lacy fleecy blizzard of queerish quanta, the dance of the woolly masters" (49) . A pun, obviously, on Gary Zukav's book, The Dancing Wu Li Masters : An Overview of the New Physics . There are, of course, broader jokes with names, such as the reference to E. Power Bricks and Z. Mormon Tabernacle (50). The authorial voice itself is indirectly undermined by the presentation of a figure within the story that ironically suggests Abbey himself: "a seedy old buzzard from nowhere who called himself a 'literary journalist' and sometimes appeared at events like this, listening carefully, nodding, smiling, deaf as a stump, taking notes, getting his facts wrong but interviewing the prettier women at exhaustive length, exploiting public bravery for private profit and calling it . . . calling it what? He called it Art" (82) . This figure hovers on the edge of some of the Earth First! demonstrations and rallies, sometimes admiring but never committed. The environmental activists, most notably Earth First !, some of whom have taken up Hayduke as a kind of cult hero, do not always fare any better. One would expect ridicule from the opposition - references to "Earth Fist" and "the Sahara Club" - but their positions are called more directly and centrally into question. The first attempt to stop the bulldozers that precede GOLIATH is introduced with a line of demonstrators at the head of Lost Eden Canyon. Thirty young people form a line to block the way, waving flags with a variety of slogans (No Compromise in Defense of Mother Earth !, We Stand For What We Stand On !, Down With Empire, Up With Spring !, etc. ) . The authorial voice observes that the exclamation mark is "the clearly favored weapon of punctuation," and then observes, "There was a time men loved ideas; now they get by with slogans" (81 ) . The group appears little better at the Earth First! Rendezvous, an aggregation of all sorts, including sparklers and Marxist social ecologists. The line here between the humor of the authorial voice and the intended self-deprecating humor of the group is almost never clear. Art Good- wrench's course in diesel mechanics is clearly a joking title for methods of sabotage, but what is one to think of Art Goodtimes and the Seminar for World Re-enchantment Through Pure Earth Poetry? (195). Whose joke is that? Abbey's? Art's? art's? In any case, the people are presented, albeit sympathetically, as "a mob of misfits and mavericks and crazy kids" ( 199) .</page><page sequence="9">Paul T. Bryant 319 The ultimate icon, of course, is George Washington Hayduke. His less admirable characteristics, such as his perpetually foul mouth, his habit of scattering beer cans across the landscape as fast as he can empty them, and his enthusiasm for sleeping with a pregnant married woman, might be regarded only as lovable pecadillos. Surely he is solid, indestructible, non- deconstructible. Or is he? Let us consider awhile. Early in the novel, when Bonnie is alone, she feels a fear that Hayduke will again enter her life, and, right after she makes a point that she is Jewish, she expresses that fear in Christian terms by repeatedly thinking he's "com- ing again" (48). Later, when the "second coming" of Hayduke has been confirmed, Doc Sarvis puts it in William Butler Yeats's terms, "like some rough beast slouching from the sands of Sinai, hitchhiking toward Bethle- hem?" (172). Doc rejects the image. Can the reader reject the image, also? In Yeats's poem, "The Second Coming," "Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world" ( 184) . In Abbey's novel, the black flag of anarchy is seen fre- quently at the rendezvous and demonstrations. The demonstrators are "all leaders" (84). "The best," Yeats says, "lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity" (185). Abbey has deliberately reminded us of Yeats's words, and Hayduke is clearly full of passionate intensity. The affinity that sticks, that remains unchallenged though perhaps unobtrusive through the novel, is between Hayduke and GOLIATH, the very force to which Hayduke is opposed. They both are given small red eyes, a feature frequently mentioned for each, indeed a feature that is insisted upon for each. In Seldom Seen's nightmare about GOLIATH they are described as "two small beady red lights, like a pair of spider eyes," that blink "slowly on then off" (61 ) . That is only a machine in a nightmare, but the actual GOLIATH is also given the red lights: "Then the black A-frame and little red spider lights, the mast and boom and high-slung drag-line bucket came into view" (244), and later, "the red eyes blinked on the summit of the 285-foot boom and A-frame, warning signals to low-flying aircraft" ( 249 ) , and again, "The red lights blinked, the strobe light flashed, high on the mast and A-frame" (255). When Hayduke and Seldom take control of GOLIATH, again "The red lights oozed off and on, off and on, like the blinking eyes of a sleepy spider" ( 262 ) . Even as the machine goes over the edge to destruction, "The spider eyes blinked" (268). In short, Abbey insists repeatedly upon the red lights, like eyes, as characteristics of the giant machine.</page><page sequence="10">320 Western American Literature Hayduke, on the other hand, when he duels Bishop Love on a bull- dozer, has "wild red crackpot eyes" (94) . When Hayduke, the arch-enemy of the machine, visits Seldom to get his help in destroying the machine, they talk in the deepening darkness of late evening. "All that Seldom could see of Hayduke's eyes were two tiny red dots, like the Tower On' bulbs of a large and mysterious night machine" ( 121 ) . As Hayduke and his partners ride toward their rendezvous with the giant machine, Hayduke is described as having "small evil red eyes in each of which burned the pinpoint fanatic fire of grim and resolute, unyielding happiness" (270) . Finally, as Hayduke prepares to abandon his old Cadillac on a beach in Mexico and flee to Australia, we are told, "Hayduke loved machines, even the silliest" (302). This is consistent with his fascination with guns, well established in The Monkey Wrench Gang . Machines, whether auto- mobiles or guns or bulldozers or draglines, are simply devices for concen- trating and projecting power. Anarchist or not, Hayduke is fascinated by power. He may not like who wields it, or what is done with it, but he loves power. Even as Hayduke watches GOLIATH fall over the cliff, he "watched his enemy go down. That enemy he loved" (286) . His pleasure with the power of controlling the machine is essentially sexual, as demon- strated by his reaction when he has just watched GOLIATH fall to destruc- tion: "Satisfied at last, he stood up, unbuttoned his coveralls and fondled it out into the open air, letting it breathe. Fully erect he staled like a stallion on the hard rimrock. Thank God I am a man" ( 287 ) . This is not resistance on principle for the sake of preservation. This is aggression for the pleasure of domination, pure machismo. Peter Fritzell, in Nature Writing and America , says that Abbey is one of only a few nature writers capable of considering the writing itself as a fact of nature, a biological phenomenon (66-67) . In this view, all human actions are as much biological phenomena as are the actions of any other animal. The artifacts of human activity are not regarded as separate, "un-natural." Thus a novel can be considered as "natural" as a beaver- gnawed tree or a lightning bolt. The novel may, in turn, represent biological phenomena such as human characters. In this novel, the biological phe- nomenon known as Hayduke confronts another result of nature in the form of humans: GOLIATH. Like a stag in rut, he must confront and dominate the most powerful rival in his territory, and he does so. Hayduke and GOLIATH, then, are simply two opposing forces, two foci of power in conflict. At the end of the novel both are gone -</page><page sequence="11">Paul T. Bryant 321 GOLIATH over the cliff and Hayduke over the ocean. Only non-human nature - i.e. the tortoise - and Jack Burns, the scout, remain and endure. Only non-human nature remains unambiguous, unironic, in Edward Abbey's writing. Everything human is ambiguous, ironic, multifaceted, unreliable. Everything human is at least arguably absurd some of the time, from Erika the Viking princess to old Jack Burns with his pockets full of chicken entrails. Nothing human escapes Abbey's penetrating eye. Scott Slovic has postulated that Abbey's fiction is intended to create a fundamental disorientation that creates an awareness of the difficulty of knowing the world. Slovic says that The Monkey Wrench Gang , "far from being overtly ideological, calls into question the very notion of allowing a static ideology, whether pro-environment or pro-development, to govern our behavior in the wilderness" (2) . Abbey the skeptic, the philosopher who conceals his sophistication, the universal satirist, is not also Abbey the misanthrope, so it is not tenable for him to be an extremist - either as environmentalist or as human being. Much as he may admire some of Hayduke's qualities, Abbey must make Hayduke as flawed as any other human, and perhaps more than some. Thus Abbey remains an environmental moderate. He begins the novel quoting Epicurus approvingly that appearance is reality. Perhaps, but the appearance of reality that Abbey presents in his fiction requires a very close and careful look to perceive the ironic ambiguity of all human behavior. Like the Greeks of Epicurus's time, he favors moderation in all things. Like the "queerish quanta" of the Wu Li Masters, he deals with pervasive indeterminacy that makes it impossible ever to be certain enough to be an extremist. 1. James spelled the first name "Caspar," a minor variation that was perhaps only inadvertence on Abbey's part. 2. I am indebted to Prof. David Smyth, of Louisiana State University, for pointing out the Stein allusion, and to Elaine Smyth, also of LSU, for noting the "pigeon" echo that follows.</page><page sequence="12">322 Western American Literature WORKS CITED Abbey, Edward.
