<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Volume XXVI JULY 1946 Number 3 THEOLOGICAL VALUES IN CURRENT METAPHYSICS CHARLES HARTSHORNE* PROFESSOR WHITEHEAD used to re- mark that there must probably have been some stage in the development of medicine prior to which it was safer to rely upon common sense than to call in a doctor. Now, said he, the question is: Has metaphysics yet reached the point where its doctrines give better guidance than the reflections of men untrained in the subject? So long as metaphysicians disagree to the extent that they now do, an affirmative answer to Whitehead's question will be troublesome to defend. And if metaphysics is unable even to sur- pass common sense, why should religion, which claims insights on a level of un- common sense, of revelation, look to metaphysicians for enlightenment? However, this at least seems plain: whether or not theological doctrines ought to develop in independence of metaphysics, they have not generally done so in the past. If theology is to be emancipated from metaphysical assump- * Professor Charles Hartshorne performs a dual role in the University of Chicago, being a member of the Department of Philosophy and of the Federated Theological Faculty. He began his teaching at Har- vard University, where he received his degrees, in- cluding the Doctor of Philosophy. He has been on the faculty of the University of Chicago since 1928. His published works include Beyond Humanism (I937) and Man's Vision of God (I94I), as well as significant philosophical studies appearing in recent and current philosophical journals. The present ar- ticle was read at a meeting of the American Theo- logical Society. tion and argument, this result will have to be achieved in the future; it cannot be taken over ready-made from the work of older theologians, whose writings con- tain many a bit of secular metaphysics and often what some of us must regard as particularly bad metaphysics. Even Barth, I suspect, is not really free from this defect. Certainly Nygren is not. It is time to define the term "meta- physics." I define it as the "rational and secular study of the universal traits of ex- perience and existence." For example, if suffering and change are held to be uni- versal, this is a metaphysical tenet, which is illustrated by the doctrine of a suffering and changing God but contra- dicted by that of an impassive and im- mutable one. By definition, there can be no exception to a metaphysical principle. A "secular" study is one which assumes no evidence other than such as is accessi- ble to any intelligent man who sufficiently reflects upon our common human experi- ence. Special religious gifts or experiences are not to be taken in evidence. They may be used to suggest hypotheses, but any decision as to true or false is to rest upon more generally accessible phenom- ena. Religious data are not excluded, pro- vided they are common property, that is, capable of detection, in some degree, in the experience even of (sufficiently ob- servant) atheists. I57</page><page sequence="2">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION It is not an assumption of metaphysics that all truth can be known by the secu- lar method but only that whatever can be known by that method, that is, from common experience, is worth knowing in that way. If, in addition, some persons can know certain things by uncommon experiences, so much the better. If theol- ogy claims to answer (for certain groups of people) some of the questions which metaphysics leaves open, the metaphysi- cian will not reject this claim a priori; though he will, of course, say that the answer is at most established for those people, not for mankind. But suppose metaphysics and theology give incom- patible answers to the same questions? Which is to give way? I answer, "Nei- ther." Not that what is true for revelation may be false for (secular) reason but that both secular reason and revelation are fallible. Revelation is uncommon reli- gious insight, divinely granted it may be, but (in spite of the claims of the Roman church and other "fundamentalists") hu- manly received and expressed and there- fore fallible-possibly, and even prob- ably, distorted either by sin or by stupid- ity. And secular human reasoning like- wise cannot be performed in such a way as to make mistakes impossible. Hence in case of conflict between theological pro- nouncements and metaphysical conclu- sions, no man is entitled to feel altogeth- er sure which is in error; though at least one of them must be so. Any metaphysi- cian or number of metaphysicians may have made a mistake; but, on the other hand, even though the philosopher be an atheist, he cannot be certain of his athe- ism and cannot be certain that the vision of God which theology codifies is not, aft- er all, an experience of reality more pro- found or adequate than any nonreligious experience. Thus, wherever metaphysics and theology are out of harmony, it seems that each discipline ought to stand by its position pending further light by its own method; yet the fact that the other discipline reaches a contradictory result should be taken on each side as secondary evidence (additional to the general fallibility of the human mind) of the need for caution and for renewed ef- fort to discover flaws in its own position. The difficulty in applying this prin- ciple is, of course, that there are many schools of theology and also many of metaphysics. But any tendency toward convergence on either side should give pause to those of the other who are out of harmony with the convergence. I say, "should give pause," not "should put to confusion or flight." For the majority may be wrong in any science or in any religion. Is there any convergence in meta- physics today? I think that there is not enough convergence to furnish a very cogent argument, but enough to be worth considering. I take it that Bergson, James, Fechner, Alexander, Whitehead, Varisco, Scheler, Ward, Boutroux, Mon- tague, Parker, Garett, Hocking, Boo- din, and others, including the present writer, are in a certain rough agreement that is somewhat more striking and rep- resentative of metaphysics since about 1850 than is any other trend. True, San- tayana is rather outside the group, as was Husserl; while Dewey is half in and half out of it, Russell is mostly outside, and the Logical Positivists reject metaphys- ics altogether-supported in this, though not completely, by C. I. Lewis. But these men have failed to familiarize themselves with the metaphysical developments re- ferred to, and hence their failure to adopt them may rest chiefly upon lack of knowledge. Suppose, for the moment, there is some such partial convergence as I have I58</page><page sequence="3">THEOLOGICAL VALUES IN CURRENT METAPHYSICS indicated-though so far only by citing names. Of what significance can this be for theology? You might argue that Christians are an l6ite minority, that a secular study, drawing on average hu- man insights, will inevitably reflect the non-Christian or even anti-Christian bias and character of ordinary men. You may even argue that to respect these average insights-or seeming insights- is to allow original sin to establish itself in our very doctrines. I reply, first of all, that original sin is not wholly escaped even by theologians-and sometimes I think that they are especially subject to it, particularly in their theoretical work, where pride of opinion and other tempta- tions assail them.' I reply, secondly, that in so far as metaphysicians are honest and competent in the application of their own method, they will decide issues only where they have positive warrant for a decision and will not adopt doctrines on a mere basis of feeling or preference, such as a distaste for Christianity or a disin- clination to recognize God. They may have to struggle hard to avoid yielding to these tendencies and may not wholly, or nearly wholly, succeed; but just so far will they fail as secular metaphysicians, for it is the professed ideal of their meth- od to avoid nonrational procedures. If, then, they achieve any success at all, their results will have some validity, Christianity or no Christianity, sin or no sin. And, finally, the direction which their thought has taken harmonizes rather well with certain developments in recent theology. What, then, is the content of the con- vergence of which I have been speaking? The simplest summary of the doctrine is that it is a social theory of reality. By 'Niebuhr has pointed out that philosophers are to some extent less exposed to the sin of pride than theologians (see Reinhold Niebuhr, Human Destiny, p. 230). "social" is not meant "human," though, since human beings do form societies, there will, according to the theory, be an analogy between any reality whatever and a human being; just as, for "mecha- nism," there is an analogy between an automobile and any other natural sys- tem. But the analogy need not in either case be close or specific; thus the social theory rests upon the utmost generaliza- tion of the resemblance between various types of social beings, of which man is but one. The theory holds that the in- sentient, dead, and mechanical is second- ary to, or even a mere appearance or spe- cial case of, the sentient, living, and so- cial. A machine is to be interpreted as a low-grade society, one whose members are on a low level of feeling and creative action, a society in which uniformity and routine almost completely overshadow, though they do not eliminate, individual variations and freedom. Every society has some routine and some uniformity among the members, otherwise the char- acteristic social functions such as sym- pathy and co-operation would be impos- sible; but in low-grade societies-for ex- ample, an association of electrons and protons, or of molecules-there is so little departure from the group norm of in- dividual behavior that, taking the soci- ety in the mass and neglecting the in- dividual members (which as such are trivial), one can make almost absolute predictions and achieve a high degree of practical control. A machine is thus a society which does what it can be expect- ed to do, or is made to do, whereas a high- grade society is always full of surprises and eccentricities. There are two chief types of low-grade societies: those in which all the members are low grade and those in which there is one radically superior and, by its supe- riority, predominating member. The I59</page><page sequence="4">THE JOURANL OF RELIGION living human body is a society of cells (relatively low-grade individuals) plus one high-grade individual, the human personality whose body it is. What we call animate matter, as Leibnitz was the first to suggest, differs from the inani- mate precisely in that in the latter there is no dominating member of the society. A pile of sand is an obvious example. No one thinks there is a "soul" of the pile, simply because the pile does not act in a sufficiently organized, unitary way to suggest that it embodies any purposes in- hering in the pile as a whole. But when we come to individual molecules, atoms, or electrons, the lack of dynamic integri- ty characteristic of many larger objects can no longer be so confidently asserted. No facts disprove and many facts sug- gest that the molecule is a society of atoms (or of particles) with a predomi- nating superatomic (or superparticular) member, the soul of the molecule. The "inorganic," as a clearly verifiable fact, is a mass phenomenon. Some groups of organisms are integrated into super- organisms (with a dominant supermem- ber), other groups are not thus inte- grated. Every individual thing above the electronic level is really a society of things, or a society of societies, etc. Some of these societies are without any super- member capable of integrating their ac- tivities sufficiently to constitute them be- souled or living bodies. A border-line case is found in the lowest multicellular animals and in the tree or large plant. It seems doubtful if there is any soul in such an "organism," but, according to the social theory, this is not because there is no psychic life in a tree but be- cause (it appears) this life is confined to the single cells. The tree in that case is a colony of cells with no supermember or tree-soul dominating the colony and or- ganizing the members into a superorgan- ism. True, the cells co-operate to main- tain the tree, but (according to the bo- tanical evidence) rather as ants co-oper- ate, and not as cells in a vertebrate body. The unity of the colony is, as unity, less than that of each of the members. The conclusion would seem to be that, while each plant cell is perhaps a dominated society of molecules (each of which may be a dominated society of atoms), the whole plant is an undominated society of cells, contrasted to the vertebrate ani- mal, which is a dominated society of cells, as these are of molecules. The remarkable fact is that this the- ory, however speculative or fanciful it may seem to some, can be so formulated as to fit not only any facts now known to science but any fact which could con- ceivably be known. It is even too little to say that it "fits" all known or know- able facts; it explains their possibility to an extent of which no other theory is capable. That there might be high-grade societies, like human groups, is only to be expected, given the theory above out- lined. On the other hand, it is equally in order that there may be societies so low grade in their members, and so lacking in a dominating, organizing supermember, as to present the appearance, to beings limited as we are in knowledge, of mere dead machines or inert masses. The social theory of existence denies that any individual unit of reality (ex- cluding mere unorganized composites from the class of "unit") is absolutely without feeling or free creative action. Thus it is the precise contradictory of materialism and of determinism-even if these doctrines are asserted of but a por- tion of nature. It is the contradictory of these doctrines, but not their contrary or extreme opposite; for it admits that some individuals have the barest or most trivial sentience and creativity, so that I6o</page><page sequence="5">THEOLOGICAL VALUES IN CURRENT METAPHYSICS the idea of mere unfeeling "matter" be- having with monotonous regularity is only the ideal negative limit to which actuality can in fact more or less closely approximate. Our theory denies also that any in- dividual is totally without sensitivity or responsiveness to other individuals, that any existent is what it is without regard to what other individuals are. This is the denial both of absolute monism, the as- sertion that there is but one real individ- ual, and of absolute atomism-defining an atom as "an individual which does not in its own being involve relationship and relativity to other beings." God, if defined as wholly self-sufficient, absolute, and independent, would be precisely such an absolute atom and con- sequently is excluded by the social the- ory. Not that this theory is atheistic, or even wholly "relativistic," but it must regard any absoluteness of God as only one aspect of his being, which in another aspect must be relative to all other be- ings, and in this sense, as in other senses, supremely social. A social being receives from others as well as gives to them. It takes upon itself their joys and suffer- ings, and in this way it is enriched, though also troubled, by their lives. It cannot in every sense and aspect be "in- dependent" of them or incapable of re- ceiving from them additions to its own being, however "complete" in some as- pects is this being. The social theory is temporalistic, the denial of any notion of a purely timeless or immutable existent. Sociality is a re- lation of streams of experiences,2 an ac- tion and reaction between living beings 2 "Stream" is not obviously a social image; but Whitehead has shown how personality can be ana- lyzed into a succession of experiences connected by social relations (one sympathizes with past and fu- ture states of "one's self"). See especially Adventures of Ideas, pp. 258 ff. whose life consists as truly in changes as in endurance or self-identity. Not that "everything" changes but that every ex- istent, every concrete being as a whole, involves change. This is compatible with and even implies that beings have ab- stract aspects which are changeless. A changing whole may have some unchang- ing factors, since the change of any factor changes the whole. So a social equivalent for the immutability of God is possible, provided it be admitted that he is not in every aspect immutable. The social theory, then, is pan-psy- chistic, pan-indeterministic (or pan-cre- ationistic), and pan-temporalistic, in the sense that every concrete being has psychic, free or creative, relative, and temporal aspects. The holders of the the- ory seem to agree in accepting the exist- ence of God. How, indeed, could a world society of free individuals exist and en- dure, and even to a minimal extent avoid chaotic, mutually destructive conflict, except thanks to a supreme member able to dominate the rest by its influence and thus co-ordinate their activities into a world order, a single complex society? God, in this doctrine, is the supreme soci- us, the all-dominating member of the cosmic society, the ideally and universal- ly social being, as contrasted to beings locally and defectively social. God is held to love all, not just a few; always, not just at times; in all their being, not with neglect of this or that aspect; and his in- fluence in the universal society will be paramount and the basis of its integrity. The older metaphysicians and theo- logians, the latter surely under influence from the former, assumed a partly un- social conception of reality in general and of God in particular. They excluded the lowest and the highest levels of being from the sphere of the social. "Inani- mate" nature was thought too inferior, I6I</page><page sequence="6">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION and God too superior or perfect, for the union of dependence, mutability, and feeling involved in sociality. The new doctrine makes perfection, by definition, the highest instance of reality as social, since to be real and to enter into social relations are for this doctrine inseparable. Thus God really is love, without cavil or inconsistency. In whatever sense a social being can be absolute and independent, God may be absolute and independent- but in that sense only; and in whatever sense a social being must, in principle and therefore even in the ideal case, de- pend upon others, God is in that sense dependent and relative. Also, even the least of beings, say an electron, will in no respect totally lack sociality-however trifling and ultra-simple its social life, that is, its life of sympathetically respon- sive and at the same time creative feeling. It is demonstrable that the pan-rela- tivism inherent in the social theory does not exclude a being absolute or independ- ent in some aspect; though it certainly excludes a being absolute in all aspects. The social is a synthesis of dependence and independence, as it is of change and permanence, or the one and the many, or order and creative freedom, or quantity and quality. It is the only conception of the universe that plays no favorites among the categories but assigns to each a place in reality as such. It treats law and freedom, unity and variety, activity and passivity, as equally real and ulti- mate, each having its function in relation to the other. In this balance as to the categorical claims lies the superior ra- tional coherence of the social theory. Where other theories explain away one or more of the universal traits of actual or conceivable experience, the social theory explains them all by their mutual rele- vance to each other. "Empiricists" tell us that theories may be coherent and yet be false to ob- served facts. True enough, as concerns theories designed to describe the actual world which happens to exist, in contrast to the worlds which might have existed. But this is the purpose not of philosophical theories but only of scientific ones. The reason not all coherent scientific theories are true is that ideas of less than meta- physical generality are alternative special cases under more general ideas. The special cases determine "possible worlds," but the very fact that we can speak of "pos- sible worlds" as a class implies that some ideas are not special cases but apply to all possible worlds and, indeed, define what is meant by the expression "pos- sible world." Now these ideas which are not special cases, and apply not to some but to all possibilities, are themselves not merely possible, for this would imply alternatives under still more general ideas, etc., in an endless regress. Coherent- ly conceived, the most general ideas have as alternatives only the same ideas less coher- ently conceived, that is, as more or less nonsensical. A coherent theory of these most gen- eral ideas is thus true by necessity- though not, for all that, certain, since the premise is that the theory is coherent, and an absolute proof of coherence is im- possible. Omniscience, unlike our human fallible knowledge, would be certain both of facts and of principles, but omniscience would also be certain that to the facts there were possible alternatives, and to the principles there were no alternatives -they being the ground of alternatives, and a thing is not the ground of its own possible nonbeing. Thus metaphysics has nothing to do with dogmatic certainty, for necessity and certainty are not iden- tical. One can be certain of the contin- gent and highly uncertain of the neces- sary. Certainty makes the nonexistence of the object impossible only if and when the certain knowledge exists, and if the I62</page><page sequence="7">THEOLOGICAL VALUES IN CURRENT METAPHYSICS knowledge itself exists contingently, then the object can be as contingent as you please. On the other hand, even a highly uncertain and contingent knowledge can have the necessary as its object, since the criterion of necessity is coherence plus the incoherence of any alternative, and the judgment that the given idea is coherent and its denial incoherent is no more required to be infallible than the judgment of mere contingent facts. If these distinctions were borne in mind, much idle controversy would be avoided. The metaphysician need not be dog- matic, though his subject matter is the necessary; and an empiricist can be dog- matic, though his subject matter is the contingent. Let us return to the social theory. To be social is to weave one's own life out of strands taken from the lives of others and to furnish one's own life as a strand to be woven into their lives. It is giving and receiving, neither having priority over the other. ("It is more blessed to give than to receive" refers to a special kind of giving, where the gift is of that material kind-consisting in low-grade societies-whose use by one interferes with its use by another.) A strange preju- dice governed both philosophy and the- ology for two thousand years. This was the supposition that, to conceive the highest being, we must maximize in con- ception the aspect of giving, but mini- mize that of receiving, maximize activity but minimize passivity, maximize unity but minimize variety, maximize perma- nence but minimize achievement of the new. This prejudice controlled the think- ing even of atheists; for the God they re- jected-as though no other could be in question-was a God so conceived. One has only to look squarely at this way of conceiving God to see that it is without rational basis. Giving and receiving are by no requirement of coherence related as mere contradictories, like knowledge and ignorance, so that, where the first is greater, the second must be less. It is just as true that a man is passive in many ways in which an atom is not as that he is active in many ways in which an atom is not; and the superiority of the man is precisely as clear in the one case as in the other. Read poetry to the man, and he may be molded and modified by this in- fluence in manifold and subtle fashion, but read poetry to the atom, and any "effects" upon it will by comparison be slight and narrowly limited in range. A man can sympathize with any living thing he sees suffering or enjoying, or imagines to do so, and this sympathy modifies the man; whereas an atom goes comparatively stolidly, "impassively" about its business though whole nations groan in agony. Again, a man's complex- ity is greater than that of an atom, and this is much more obvious than that his integrity or unity is greater. Aquinas admits this, but pretends that it proves nothing as to complexity in God. However, not only is it true that in all factual cases the higher beings are more complex and more amply passive but the alternative is not even coherently conceivable. Passivity is correlative to activity by the very meaning of the ideas; to act upon another appropriately is to act relatively to the nature and activity of another, and this relativity is passiv- ity. Passivity is the social relevance of ac- tivity, that which gives activity an object. The effort to escape this leads to such patent incoherences as that God's action upon our free will "infallibly" makes us do exactly what we do do, but makes us do it freely, that is, so that we were not made to do it but were "free to do some- thing else." Similar considerations will show that the higher integrity must go with greater variety or complexity, and the uttermost I63</page><page sequence="8">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION permanence with the supreme capacity for change. Among the arguments for the traditional denial of these correlations, I shall here consider one. As the capacity for entertaining good purposes and thoughts increases (the argument runs), that for entertaining bad ones increases also. The more complex and amply pas- sive beings are thus also the more un- stable. Satan was a rebel angel, and every angel, I suppose, is a potential satan. If, then, God is the upper limit of the series of more and more complex and social be- ings, he must be infinitely fragile and in- finitely capable of ill will. This argument I answer briefly as follows. The upper limit of a series must have some unique properties. All that is required is that this uniqueness really follows from, rather than contradicts, the law of the series. Now it is a law of the series of be- ings that the higher members are more modifiable by others, socially responsive to them, and in this way more compli- cated in their being. But it follows from this law that the highest being is modifi- able and complicated by others in the highest degree, therefore by all others, and from this it follows that these others must be its internal members, for an ex- ternal member is one which, in so far as it is external, fails to modify and complicate the being to which it is external. The highest member in the world society will be passive to the other members only as the soul is passive to the body which it dominates, controls, and possesses. The conclusion is that all those aspects of complexity and dependence which derive from relationship to what is external and unpossessed will be absent from the high- est activity-passivity. The possibility of ill will and of destruction are just such aspects derivative from an external en- vironment. Where all entities are fully enjoyed and possessed within, there can be no "envy" of others (recall Plato's remark concerning the creator), no com- petitive conflict with them; for their be- ing and good must be integral to one's own being and good, more completely than a man's cells are integral to the man, for these cells are only more or less internal to or possessed by the human mind. Thus, for example, the bones are less internal or fully possessed than are the brain cells. The sociality of existence can then be fully preserved and maximized in God without attributing to him evil will or impermanence. And his maximal depend- ence or passivity will be compatible with his possessing also maximal independence or absoluteness (in another aspect of his being). Giving and receiving do not con- flict with but supplement each other. As receiving, God indeed "depends," but for what? Not for his existence, the fact that he is and is himself. This being-himself he has never received. What he receives is rather his being-himself-with-just-this- or-that-content-of-social-experience. It is the essence of personal self-identity, is it not, that it is at least somewhat inde- pendent of a detailed content of experi- ence? I can be myself whether you say "Yes" to my previous question or "No." But there are some contents that I could not have in my experience, for example, the observation of my own death or birth. Only God can experience whatever can occur, and so only in God is the as- pect of independence which is inherent in selfhood an absolute independence, in that aspect. This aspect is that of exist- ence and essential personality. And this not only is compatible with but implies an unrivaled dependence as to exact non- essential content. No other being is so sensitively modifiable by all that comes to exist; and none so completely and con- sciously mirrors all realities other than itself. This mirroring is not merely ac- tive, for realities are partly self-deter- I64</page><page sequence="9">THEOLOGICAL VALUES IN CURRENT METAPHYSICS mined, and, in determining themselves, they determine what God is to mirror. He does not by mirroring decide that, and just how, they are to exist; for then they would have no reality as self-decided and free. It has been the contention of theologi- ans, most recently Nygren, that the di- vine love is entirely without "need" or "desire" and has nothing to gain from the good it bestows. This is supposed to guarantee the unselfishness of the divine love, whereas (it is thought) the selfish loves, as such, spring from dependence and desire. This, I maintain, is not good religion but bad metaphysics. To will the good of others is the entire positive side of benevolence, and it adds nothing to this to insist that one must not, in willing the good of others, find in this good also good for one's self. Why, in fact, do we regard human love as imperfect? Is it really because the lover regards the gain of the other as also a gain for himself? Or is it not rather because the wish for self to some extent conflicts with, inhibits, and renders precarious the wish for others? The one who loves from a fluctuating, limited need to see others prosper will love only so long and so far as the need extends; beyond that he will be indiffer- ent, or he will hate. But suppose the need that others should prosper extends all the way and endures everlastingly, cov- ering fully all the needs of others? Suppose it is always and precisely God's need (not as necessary to his existence but to his fullest happiness) that the utmost possible good of the creation be accom- plished? Such need obviously could not conflict with the unstinted service of the creature. Surely it is absurd to quarrel with an unflinching and complete devo- tion to the good of others simply because this good is also a good for self! No prag- matic or operational difference can be imagined between this love and the al- leged love without need. What is there but word idolatry in the traditional in- sistence upon the latter? And what, on any analogical basis, could be meant by perfect altruism or generosity but a com- plete finding of one's own good in achiev- ing the good of others? It is actually imperfect men, not the perfect God, who can reasonably be asked to love where they cannot hope al- ways and wholly to gain from the wel- fare of the beloved. For men are partly ignorant of the good they accomplish for others, as they are of all things in this complicated world. In some cases they cannot even expect to be alive when the intended happiness of others (such as that aimed at in the making of a will) is realized. But God and God alone can count on always surviving and always knowing fully all that he benevolently accomplishes; and, in respect to value, perfect knowledge is perfect possession. Any emotions of beauty and joy which God enables us to have become elements in his own all-embracing experience, con- tributory to the richness of that experi- ence. Each such contribution makes pos- sible for God a unique form of beauty which in no other way could have ex- isted for him. Omniscience thus removes from God the sole reason for that form of altruism which seeks the good of an- other in partial disregard of whether or not it is good for self. Such altruism is in very truth an imperfection, a glory of the imperfect will as such. It is a glory moral- ly because it is the choice of the greater good over the lesser, in cases where one can do more for the whole, including self, by serving others, without corre- sponding gain for the self. But it is a metaphysical imperfection, because it implies expected ignorance of the good realized for others. Only through this ex- pected ignorance can there be a noncoin- I65</page><page sequence="10">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION cidence between the greater good and the good for self. Thus theology may avoid the danger- ous situation in which Nygren and many another find themselves of seeing noth- ing in common or analogous between hu- man love-like that of father for child, or husband for wife, or Jesus for his human fellows-and the divine love. The sub- lime contrast between human and divine benevolence consists not in the sheer dif- ference between need and no need but in the gap between abysmal ignorance and omniscience, and between partial and shifting inhibition of the interest of others by self-interest, as contrasted to certain and absolute coincidence of other-interest and self-interest. Most of the good of others is not known to us at all; we could not specifically desire it either for their sakes or for ours; and often others' good is just well enough known to us to make apparent its lack of harmony with our own desires. Nevertheless, there is even in us a partial coincidence of desire for self and desire for others; and this is the analogical basis for theism. The role of bodily desire in human love is only an especially striking case of the gap and partial conflict between our felt needs and the needs of others, or our awareness and their good. The body pays little heed, in its demands, to the state of affairs in the lives around it. The body's need is not specifically a need for the cre- ation of good in the lives of those outside the body. But suppose all "others" were within the body, as its members; then, since the need of the body is for the flour- ishing of its own parts or members, bodi- ly desire and altruism would be coinci- dent. (Even in us bodily desire is in a measure altruistic toward the bodily members.)3 The idea that the world is, in 3 See my Man's Vision of God and the Logic of Theism (Chicago: Willett, Clark &amp; Co., I94I), pp. I5I ff. a manner and analogically speaking, the body of God seems grotesque to us only because we unwittingly read into it some feature incompatible with the require- ment that all others be wholly within the body, distinguished from it as "other" only as members are from the whole, and the further requirement that this body be fully possessed by a single mind;4 whereas the human body is not, without qualification, possessed by our minds (for example, much less in sleep than in wak- ing). This defect of the human body is one with the fact that this body has an external environment, for from this it follows that there can be no absolute dis- tinction between internal and external. Only where nothing is external can any- thing be absolutely internal. Thus even a man's brain cells are not fully possessed by his consciousness (if they were, we should all be better anatomists than any scientific specialist), much less his bones or his fingernails, or the half-digested food in his stomach. If we define "desire" as a state of longing whose satisfaction brings joy and whose frustration brings sorrow, or at least lesser joy, then desire is selfish or unselfish according as what will satisfy it is, or is not, the very well-being of others as such. An example of unselfish longing is Lincoln's desire that the slaves might be free, assuming, as within limits seems to have been true, that he desired this not primarily that he might stand forth as the slaves' deliverer but simply that the slaves and men generally might enjoy a higher level of well-being. The fact that theologians have thought so little about the possibility of perfectly generous or other-regarding desire re- flects, one suspects, the poverty of such desires in men. We must not deny desire to God because, forsooth, if it were our 4 Ibid., pp. I74 ff i66</page><page sequence="11">THEOLOGICAL VALUES IN CURRENT METAPHYSICS desire it would be niggardly and fitful in its inclusion of the good of others. What anthropomorphism this is; not less so because it is in part the result of an over- strained anti-anthropomorphism. If we refuse to conceive God by analogy with our virtues, that is to say, our other-re- garding desires, and habits of acting upon them, we shall end by conceiving him by analogy with our vices, for example, our most truly and deeply "selfish" wish for self-sufficiency-for some mode of achiev- ing our own good which will release us from the need to achieve the good of others. How the rich and the envious (to some extent all of us) long to accomplish this trick! To strive to be "independent" in personal self-identity and in goodness of character, rightness of volition, is a virtue, and such independence is supreme in God; but the very wish to enjoy, to be happy, altogether independently of others and their happiness or woe, is vicious. In this matter traditional theology is on the side of Satan-or, if you prefer, is at cross-purposes with itself. Another gift of the new metaphysics to religion is in connection with the prob- lem of immortality. It has often been said that immortal life is now, and is a "quality," not a mere quantitative ex- tension, of living. But what this means, who of the older schools of theology has told us? Yet the social view of reality and of God can tell us. Each of us is, in his very being, his very life just as lived on earth, a contribution to the experience of God. This experience is indestructible; for in order to take on new content God has no need to forget the old. If his attention span were limited in that fashion, he could not, one may argue, fully grasp even the present; for things sum up their histories, and he who has turned his at- tention away from a thing's past cannot be fully aware of its present. So our least experience, thought, or feeling is an in- delible note in the divine symphony. The only question is how far such an element is fortunate for the whole and how far a misfortune. We contribute once for all, every moment, our very being of that moment to the undying treasury of all good. But do we contribute in that mo- ment the best we have opportunity for doing, that is, for being, and helping others to be? If so, then we are immortal not only in fact but in quality, that is, we measure up to the dignity of our immor- tality. This entire account depends upon the social and temporal view of God. For if God received nothing from the events of our lives, then our immortality could consist only in prolongation after death in a new series of adventures. If there be such prolongation, I do not know. But I do know that it would not meet what I must view as the chief need for immor- tality-the need that our lives, our ex- periences just as they are, should have permanent value. Apart from a receptive God, the long-run significance of our liv- ing must be seen in that abstract and highly partial deposit of experience called "character," plus such pale memories as survive in us of our experiences as they become past, along with the hope-des- perate enough, at least so far as philoso- phy or science knows-that death (in- dividual and ultimately racial) will be followed by an endless string of new ex- periences for each of us. I cannot suppose that we live essentially either for the fu- ture or for a present which in becoming past becomes virtually nothing, a wraith and an echo; but rather we must live ior a present which in becoming past be- comes, as Whitehead says, immortal in God, in whom it "lives forevermore." God, then, is a socially receptive being, taking upon himself the very being of others, contingently upon the manner of their self-determinations, which there- by acquire their abiding significance.
