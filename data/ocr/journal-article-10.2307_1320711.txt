However, paradigmatic differences exist between traditional and computer media that demand a re-evaluation of this practice. In this study, terms and concepts used in art education to describe the visual features of art images were compared with those used in computer graphics. Over 1000 terms were identified and analyzed. The findings demon- strate that formalist concepts about the elements and principles of design in art education must be expanded or replaced to include new terminology and concepts about visual prop- erties of images. In many cases, computer terminology may serve as a useful model for design theory in traditional art media. Perceptual qualities are a kind of portal through which we first engage with art- work. Before understanding artwork on a conceptual, sociological, or cultural level, we must first apprehend its visual features. Perception provides an important impe- tus for both production and art appreciation. An appreciation of visual qualities may be indispensable for aesthetic experience (Czikszentmihalyi &amp; Robertson, 1990; Haanstra, 1994); certainly an erroneous understanding of visual features can lead to misinterpretations of cultural or social aspects. Art educators describing the visual appearance of art images are likely to draw upon paradigms based on formalist art criticism and aesthetics. They do so because those paradigms are common in the literature, and formalist terms and concepts are well-established in the field (Feldman, 1992.) The intent of this study was to deter- mine how appropriate formalist terms apply for describing the visual properties of images created with computer technology, since paradigmatic differences exist between the nature of traditional art media and the nature of computer graphics. For example, in traditional art, the medium itself-whether paint, clay, or silverprint- is a literal, static, analog repository of information (Binkley, 1989). In computer art, the conceptual code is digital. The image can take many forms, such as digital code, picture elements (pixels) on screen, or different forms of output which include video, slides, or hard copy. Since pixels are a kind of "visual fodder" (Wright, 1989, p.50), computer program capabilities afford interaction between and within medi- ums, which is physically impossible in traditional art. The computer also can generate much of an image itself through such interme- diary devices as imaging algorithms. While an artist's hand guides the marks made with brushes or pens, many marks, whole areas of texture, and a number of global</page><page sequence="2">TERMS effects like lighting and shadows can be created by the computer. Hidden element algorithms, cutting and pasting, and image manipulation challenge perceptions of underlying structure and discriminations among sensory elements in computer graphics. Paradigmatic differences such as these, which would call for an enhanced or a more specific treatment of design theory in both art education and computer graph- ics, have not been addressed. Historically, computer art has been couched within such traditional art conventions and styles as European constructivism, Renaissance perspective, op art, or modernist formalism (Jones, 1989; Wright, 1989). Nadin believes that in the process of appropriating the new technology, "traditional artists, technologists and scientists have acted to preserve modes of expression they believe in, like, or have tried to explain" (1989, p. 44.) He points out that even visualization of highly diversified spaces, 3D (virtual space) explo- rations, and color explorations are still treated according to the aesthetics of white paper or canvas (p.44). Art teachers often perpetuate formalist traditions as well, perhaps because "...the underlying structure of the computer screen is parallel to traditional atomistic approaches to teaching the art elements as presented during the past fifty years in many art and design texts" (Ettinger, 1988, p. 56). Unfortunately, while many art educators subsume computer graphics to the lan- guage of traditional formalist theory, practitioners and critics in computer graphics tend to avoid art theory in favor of technical discussions (Ettinger, 1988; Nadin, 1989). Thus, ignorance of terminology and concepts in both fields is a barrier to articulating common theory. This study examined the vocabulary, concepts, and methods used by computer artists in order to determine areas described here where paradigmatic differences require an expanded, delimited, or transitional design vocabulary for art education. In 1992 Johnson warned, "Art educators proposing an increase in the conceptual content of art instruction need to resolve the unexplored issues which surround design as a basic art concept" (p. 152). In response, this study also examined the vocabulary and concepts of design in art education. Procedures In the first stage of the study, written materials which identified design vocabu- lary were chosen on the basis of their value as resources that delineated and defined terminology for visual features in either field. They included texts, journal articles, computer program manuals, and art education curriculum materials. Materials were also chosen because of their availability to practitioners in both fields over a period of ten years. They served as typical resources for the acquisition of termi- nology (see Table 1). The methodology of domain analysis (Spradley, 1980) was used to examine visual features in art education and computer graphics. Approximately 900 different terms were identified in the literature, such as com- plementary color, recursive, negative shape, aliased, or harmony. A side-by-side comparative taxonomy of visual elements and principles in tra- ditional education and computer graphics was created, and the 900 terms were sort- ed into cross-comparative analyses. Eighteen pages of taxonomic analysis were developed, which made it possible to examine areas of conceptual similarity 185</page><page sequence="3">MIA JOHNSON Table 1 Literature Used in Domain Analysis Art education Chapman, L.H.

In order to contextualize and further develop an understanding of terms found in the literature, eight expert informants (two computer graphics artists, two computer art educators, two traditional artists and two art educators) were asked to describe the visual appearances of four stim- uli (two computer art images and two traditional drawing and painting images) which were chosen to exemplify different visual and structural features. Informants were recommended for their knowledge and ability to apply terminol- ogy both orally and in critical text. An analysis of the interview data revealed the use of approximately 3000 terms for visual features. Two-thirds of these were duplicates. New terms were added to the taxonomies of terms found in the literature. All data from the literature search, the domain analysis, the comparative taxonomies, and the interpretation of inter- views were compared and contrasted. Research Findings A list of what Spradley (1980) calls "cover terms" was developed in compo- nential analysis: formal image, format, clarity of image, two-dimensional space, two-dimensional shape, three-dimensional space, three-dimensional shape, sur- face, line, pattern, texture, repetition, balance, color, tone, lighting, point of view, unity, emphasis, and variety. These 20 cover terms proved applicable to discussing 186</page><page sequence="4">TERMS design elements and principles in both traditional and computer mediums, although significant changes or expansions in the traditional meanings of space, shape, tex- ture, color, and repetition emerged as a result of the comparisons. The tradition- al principles, rhythm, variety, harmony, balance, and unity, proved to be less applicable to computer graphics. Three new global properties emerged: clarity of image, lighting, and point of view. Concepts about formal image and format were found to be pervasive in the visual language of both fields. Recent devel- opments in three-dimensional computer graphics (known as "3D graphics") in particular are challenging traditional concepts about visual properties. 1. In the literature of art education, the traditional formal image was viewed as a whole, with stable, analog contents bound to the form. Computer graphics were determined to be dynamic and digital, and procedures were determined to play an important part in expanding the idea of an abstract "language." Generative and interpolative procedures in computer graphics, as well as the replicability of the same image in different output modes, beg notions of what is original or unique in art. Signifiers that are appropriated (see Gombrich, 1961, for a discussion of codes and signifiers) also appear to be an important part of artis- tic language in both mediums. The implications are that, even in terms of its visu- al properties, the formal image can no longer be perceived as referring only to itself with what has been described as "permanent or residual aesthetic value" (Crozier &amp; Greenhalgh, 1992, p. 83-4). 2. In traditional art education, the format is perceived as a kind of container or a field of view which may be used to assess the alignment of elements. In com- puter graphics, the elements are composed either in terms of an xy central axis in Paint and Draw programs or an xyz axis-oriented world space in 3D graphics rather than in relation to an exterior format. Diagonals are grades which interact with each other rather than with the format. The field of view is dynamic; it is constantly scaled, enlarged, or reduced. 3. Clarity of image is used as a cover term for descriptions of different kinds of visual consistency (variously called harmony, regularity, or constancy) that were manifest in both the literature and interviews. Clarity differs from "unity" in that it is a quantitative measure of the evenness, regularity, or consistency of an image. Clarity of image included such disparate qualities as the evenness of sur- face sheen, the consistency of a style, or uniform use of a particular medium, such as watercolor, and appears to be an important aesthetic element. 4. The term two-dimensional space was variously used in art education liter- ature to describe both a two-dimensional working surface, whether it was rough, woven, smooth, polished, or grid-like, and different spatial activities, whether arrangements of flat, planar shapes or illusionistic simulations. Ideas about space in computer graphics appear to be organizing principles rather than art elements, since different kinds of artistic and mathematical spaces determine the kinds of activities which can occur in them. Two-dimensional space in computer graphics, used in Paint or Draw programs, is a distinct operating environment that uses a bitmap or matrix of invisible points. In Paint programs, pixels on the monitor can be lit up to the right or below invisible lines between the points; in Draw programs 187</page><page sequence="5">MIA JOHNSON (known as "2D graphics"), the points can be connected with visible lines to cre- ate planar shapes called polygons. 5. Two-dimensional shape was applied in art education literature to geomet- ric, decorative or planar shapes, negative or positive, with characteristics like soft and hard edges. Overlapped shapes were often perceived as three-dimensional in art education literature. Two-dimensional shapes in computer graphics include both pixel-based shapes (called regions) in Paint programs, and 2D polygons. Polygons may be layered, resized, or transformed. In 3D graphics, polygons also have front and back faces, unlike their analog counterparts, and can be made three-dimensional. The concept of two-dimensional shape must be expanded to include the generative possibilities of polygons in 2D or 3D graphics, such as using corner handles which can be manipulated, and the concept that overlapped shapes in 2D graphics are coplanar rather than three-dimensional. 6. In art education literature, the term three-dimensional space was used to describe both an illusionistic environment that is simulated on a two-dimensional surface, as well as an actual, physical space in the real world. In 3D graphics, three-dimensional space refers to a void rather than a picture plane or a surface. 360-degree objects are created and then placed in the void, much like a stage is set with props. The objects subsequently can be manipulated through such tech- niques as scaling, orientation to other objects, and lighting. 7. In the literature of art education, the term three-dimensional shape often was used interchangeably with the term form, and applied to actual three-dimen- sional objects such as sculptures. In other cases, three-dimensional shape referred to an illusion or simulation on a two-dimensional surface. Similarly, form was used to describe both real-world objects and illusions of them on a two-dimen- sional surface. In 3D graphics, three-dimensional shapes were defined precisely as entities or objects which interact in actual geometric relationship to each other. This concept expands the formalist idea of three-dimensional shapes as illusion- istic organizations of tone or contrast on a ground. However, despite the fact that objects in computer graphics may be assigned properties such as weight or iner- tia, unlike sculptures, they are entirely conceptual or immaterial. 8. In traditional analog mediums, the surface of an object or a plane in a pic- ture is frequently the same thing as its side or face. In 3D graphics, surfaces are separate and very important properties called materials. Materials are bitmaps of color, tone, or transparency which may be smooth, textured, bumpy, or reflective. They are created independently and "assigned" to objects or planes. 9. Line was found to be an important element in formalist art education. Lines were frequently described in emotional or anthropomorphic terms such as passive or lively. Lines generated by computers were described by informants (when the term line was used at all) in terms of literal signs of computer mediation, such as regularity, flatness, and spacing. A greater number of terms for line in computer graphics, such as row, segment, or vector, result from working in different spa- tial environments and signify interactive constraints. A number of interactive fea- tures peculiar to computers, such as the potential to bend lines called splines like 188</page><page sequence="6">TERMS barrel staves after they have been created, also expand formalist concepts of line in analog mediums. 10. In both the literature of art education and the interviews, pattern was var- iously defined as an element and as a principle. The basic concept was one of ele- ments combined to form motifs which are repeated in a border, a localized pat- tern, a grid, or a continuous pattern. Concepts about pattern as a design feature that is constructed or assembled by the artists must be expanded to include pat- terns that come with the program, that are authored or created by the programmer, as well as the interactive and generative potential of mathematically-based pattern designs. Global, unifying procedures in computer graphics can also organize local elements with such procedures as mirroring. 11. The term texture, like line and space, carried numerous associations in both fields and needs to be carefully delineated in art education. Texture in art education was defined as a surface quality which may either be illusionistic or have actual surface depth. Texture in Paint programs is the result of either alter- ing the hue or tone of individual pixels or using ready-made textures which have uniform qualities more like patterns than textures. Texture in 3D graphics is a form of rendering, using materials, that succeeds the geometric modeling of poly- gons or objects. Most 3D programs have libraries of ready-made textures to which digitized photographs of less uniform textures in the real world may be added. 12. In the review of art education literature, the term repetition referred to both the replication or copying of a single element, and the use of elements which are more alike than dissimilar. In computer graphics, numerous imaging effects are based on different kinds of repetition. For example, duplicate, copy, sweep, array, and instance refer to different procedures for copying an original element (such as an open or closed polygon), or for repeating it in a series. The term "iter- ation" refers to a process for calculating a desired result by repeating a cycle of operations, which comes progressively closer to the result. Fill refers to an equiv- alency of identical elements which as a whole take the form of a solid color or shape. The computer term recursion refers to a kind of image self-similarity where the details and parts reflect the whole, such as a snowflake or a branching tree. The term repetition does not serve to accommodate these different proce- dures and their resultant effects. 13. In traditional art, formal principles such as balance are a result of sponta- neous interaction between the medium and elements of art. In computer graphics, formal principles are arranged hierarchically in both the mathematical sense and in procedures. While the traditional artist may "intuitively" balance elements, the computer artist is constrained to such specific procedures as duplicating, flipping rotating, or slanting to achieve areas of local balance, and by such procedures as mirroring or recursion for global balance. Traditional concepts of balance in art education should be expanded to include an emphasis on the algorithmic possi- bilities of image formations. 14. In analog mediums, color is made of pigment or dye, and color wheels in art education demonstrate the complementary or analogous relationships of addi- 189</page><page sequence="7">MIA JOHNSON tive mixtures of the primary colors red, yellow, and blue. In the literature of art education, varying degrees of intensity and value were perceived as creating advancing or receding depth effects, and a sense of color temperature. In com- puter graphics, on-screen color is made of light, and color theory is subtractive. The primary colors red, green, and blue are manipulated with sliding scales that alter the hue, increase or decrease the value, and vary the degree of color satura- tion. Similarly, in the interviews, graphic artists described color in terms of degrees on different continuums, rather than by categorizing color variations. 15. Tone or value was described in the literature of art education as the qual- ities of light and dark in an image, which are manifested through chiaroscuro, modeling (shading), or hatching techniques. The application of tone in computer graphics is an independent procedure which can create uniform global effects such as lighting, color intensity, and resolution rather than local contrast. The use of tone in terms of focus in 3D graphics, through such filtering procedures as fog or transparency, also expands the formalist concept of tone as shading. The word shading in art education and computer graphics should also replace modeling in art education, since modeling in computer graphics refers to the geometric con- struction of a 3D object. 16. In both traditional art and 3D graphics, lighting was found to be a global, unifying device that can create both consistency and regularity between elements in a composition. However, in traditional analog mediums such as paint, the con- tent and the effects of lighting on content are inseparable; that is, a single brush- stroke can convey shape, color, tone, texture, and lighting. Like the camera or point of view, lighting in 3D graphics is created separately and manipulated inde- pendently of the content. There are also three different kinds of lights which may be set. 17. Point of view refers to the geometric relationship of objects in a picture to the artist's eye level and location. While point of view must be established a pri- ori in analog art and 2D graphics, point of view is established in 3D graphics by placing a moveable camera in the three-dimensional void. The movement of the camera (or of the look-at point, another feature of the camera) in relation to the objects in the void determines the eye level and the angle of view, and thus affects both the visual structure and configuration of elements in the selected design. Because point of view, like lighting, is externally applied as a mathematical com- puter function rather than estimated by eye, as is the case in traditional drawing or painting, it can be seen as a new global property with perfect geometric con- sistency. 18. In traditional art, the principle unity refers to proximal relationships between elements. Four important concepts about unity were identified as: (1) a sense of visual continuity between elements; (2) the proximity of figures to ground and (3) of content to format; and (4) the distribution of color. Consistency of resolution and the importance of lighting in computer graphics expand the number of formalist fundamentals which are believed to contribute to unity. Mathematical continuity between elements is also a primary focus of computer art, although it is usually viewed in terms of practical rather than visual effects. 190</page><page sequence="8">TERMS For example, unlike analog art, color schemes can be mediated for consistency by the computer. Measures of digital control specific to 3D graphics include global patterning, ray tracing, shadows, transparency, and atmospherics. Computer art may be seen in terms of working with the computer to build an aggregate of these features, rather than proximal relationships. 19. In art education, emphasis referred to the visual focal point or weight of the artwork. It was discussed in terms of degree, and in terms of the isolation or place- ment of elements. Informants, however, perceived emphasis as a kind of global organization, such as a pervasive pattern. Emphasis was also understood to mean a unifying cognitive theme, such as "a carnival atmosphere." The term was not used in the literature of computer graphics. 20. In the literature of art education, formalist ideas about variety depended on the dominance or subordination of sensory elements such as color and shape, and on contrasting characteristics of sensory elements. Variety was not found to be an important principle in computer graphics, although variety of materials was impor- tant for practical purposes like edge detection or for simulation. In informant descriptions, variety was also perceived as a conceptual rather than perceptual attribute. Conclusion As Johnson (1992) predicted, there were many ambiguities in the application of terminology for the elements and principles of design in art education. Authors frequently applied and defined terms differently. The conceptual analysis of traditional elements and principles of art as described in the liter- ature and as employed by the informants of this study indicated that some elements may actually be principles in certain contexts, while some princi- ples may be global elements. Principles certainly do not appear to be laws, criteria, or rules. In both the literature and in informant interviews, images were perceived as wholes, with regular, irregular, consistent, or inconsistent features within those wholes. Global elements such as tone, pattern, resolu- tion, or lighting can aid in the consistency or regularity of images. The con- cept of clarity of image, as a self-contained feature of artworks, is unlike formalist notions of harmony which assumes a Platonic match with an ideal standard. Art educators often view computer-mediated art as something foreign and new. The most interesting finding of the study was that both the more explicit meanings of computer graphics terms and the manner in which computer images are hierarchically constructed, in terms of both mathematics and procedures, often suggested an excellent studio model for teaching and learning about tradi- tional art. For example, rather than attempting to subsume computer graphics to often ambiguous traditional definitions of 2D space, it may be theoretically more useful to view traditional 2D artwork with "discrete" measurable and repeated picture areas, such as weavings or mosaics, in terms of computer bitmaps. Traditional 2D artwork which employs flat, graphic arrangements of shapes may be compared theoretically to computer Draw modes which utilize coplanar shapes. The term surface or the computer term material would be very useful in both constructing and deconstructing an understanding of analog mediums. It 191</page><page sequence="9">MIA JOHNSON would be particularly useful in distinguishing between the idea of plane as a polygon, and the idea of a bitmap as a surface. The term three-dimensional space might usefully be delimited in art education to refer to a three-dimensional coordinate system in a simulation of a 360 degree void as it is in computer graphics. Informants also referred to two-dimensional simulations of three-dimensional shapes in art images as objects or forms, or by their names, such as flower or chair. It appeared that mental models of objects with three-dimensional coordinate systems preceded recognition of two-dimen- sional analog simulations. 3D graphics thus could provide a useful model for teaching students to arrange simulated objects in those 2D drawings and paint- ings which seek to represent a three-dimensional space, rather than to compose with illusionist shapes. There are many fundamental differences between traditional art media and computer graphics. If we truly wish to understand computer art and to integrate it with art education, one critical aspect of that process is a reassessment of tra- ditional terms and definitions for visual features. Another critical aspect is a willingness to learn and understand computer terminology. This study is a pre- liminary move toward an ongoing exchange of concepts and information.
