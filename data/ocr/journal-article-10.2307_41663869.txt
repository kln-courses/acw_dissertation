When the statue of Zeus at Olympia is mentioned, most people think of the famous gold and ivory cult image created by the most celebrated of all ancient sculp- tors, Phidias, who flourished in the second half of the fifth century B.c. This colossal piece of statuary wrought in gold, ebony and ivory depicted the god enthroned, and was considered one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Today we would have little idea of the statue's appearance had not Pausanias, the second-century trav- eler, left on record a full and apparently accurate de- scription (V.ll). Until a few years ago virtually no trace of Phidias' greatest masterpiece had been found at the place where it once stood, and for a visual impression of the statue we are still dependent on a handful of Hadrianic and later bronze coins from Olympia. These afford us a fleeting glimpse in miniature of the work as a whole, while one among them (Figure 1) gives some idea of the majesty of the statue's head. In the days of Pausanias one of the buildings within the sanctuary of Olympia was still known as "the work- shop of Phidias." Some five years ago the excavators of the German Institute thoroughly investigated the site of this ruined building, about one hundred meters west of the great temple. They brought to light broken sculp- tor's tools, molds for golden drapery and bits of ivory, bone and glass. One of the most exciting incidents was the discovery of a little damaged vase. Scratched on the bottom, in well formed letters, was the inscription, "I belong to Phidias." (See Archaeology 12 [1959] 137). Here was welcome corroboration of the identification of 105</page><page sequence="3">All coins shown at about one and one-halj times actual size. 3. Stater of Elis, ca. 490 B.c.

These discoveries, as well as unpublished results of other recent research in Olympia, have provided new and decisive evidence which enables us to answer still another of the riddles of the past. Exactly when did Phidias erect this great cult image in the worthy setting provided by the vast Temple of Zeus? There has been long and bitter controversy about this, but at last victory seems to go to those who favor what is called the "late dating." According to this theory Phidias did not go to Olympia until after he had completed his other masterpiece, the colossal chryselephantine statue of Athena which graced the Parthenon. We know for a fact that the Athena Parthenos was completed in the year 438 B.c. On this basis the Olympian Zeus cannot well be dated before 430, and it may even be a little later. Acceptance of this theory has important consequences. The great Temple of Zeus was planned by the Elean architect Libon and was begun, as we know, around 470 B.c. It is certain that the building, with its magnifi- cent sculptural adornment, was completed by about 457. This was more than twenty years before Phidias was to begin work on his masterpiece, perhaps thirty years be- fore the great statue was finished. What did the interior of the cult room at Olympia look like before Phidias was summoned to create his colossal statue? The Temple of Zeus was one of the biggest and most lavishly deco- rated sanctuaries in the whole of the Peloponnesus. A temple was always - at least in Greece - the dwelling of a god, and the housing of a cult statue was the essence of its function. The ancient sources, however, are com- pletely silent on this matter, and we are not given the least clue as to the contents of the sanctuary when it was first completed or during the quarter of a century which elapsed before Phidias came to Olympia. Is it likely, or even possible, that this splendid temple stood empty for so many years after its completion ? The literary sources are silent, but archaeology can be called in to help us find a solution to the mystery. 106</page><page sequence="4">5. Above: Stater of Elis, ca. 490 b.c.

Eighty years ago the Altis (sacred precinct) at Olympia was first excavated systematically by German archaeolo- gists. Here were found a large number of bronze statuettes, plinths for statues and many other objects associated with the cult of Zeus, the principal deity worshiped at Olympia. Among the statuettes were four in identical posture, each representing Zeus in the ful- ness of his vigor, striding purposefully forward with a thunderbolt in his raised right hand and an eagle poised on his outstretched left arm. Later on, still other similar statuettes were unearthed, so that the tally for Olympia alone is more than a dozen, while almost identical figures have been found elsewhere on the mainland in Greece, especially in the Peloponnesus. We illustrate only a few of them (Figure 2). It is evident that this whole class of votive statuettes has its roots in the Archaic art of the sixth century b.c. There are, for example, bronze relief plaques, most of them from Olympia, which portray a similar divine figure striding out to battle with the monster Typhon. The pose is identical with that of the later bronze statuettes. These reliefs can be dated to the first decades of the sixth century B.c., and it would seem that toward the end of the century this concept of the striding deity was, so to say, "canonized" in the Zeus with thunderbolt and eagle. This sculptural convention reached the peak of artistic refinement during the first half of the fifth century. An even more striking illustration of the importance of this type of the striding Zeus is provided by another class of minor antiquities, the early series of the official coins of Elis, the territory wherein was situated the sanc- tuary of Olympia. Coinage began relatively late at Elis. Whereas in the Greek world, generally, mints had been active since the early sixth century B.c., the rural com- munities of the northwestern Peloponnesus were content to make use of coins struck outside the area, evincing a definite preference for the celebrated coinage of Aegina^ which had a turtle as its device. Coin hoards from many Peloponnesian sites have confirmed the tradition that these "turtles" were particularly "the coin of the Peloponnesus." Not until the end of the sixth century did the Eleans issue coins of their own, and it is interest- ing that the new silver pieces were struck to the same standard as the Aeginetan "turtles," which they rapidly 107</page><page sequence="5">7.

The types of the new coins were in- timately connected with the Olympian Zeus. On the ob- verse is a majestic eagle, traditional symbol of this god's power, while the reverse shows the thunderbolt, the symbolism of which is rooted deep in the ancient East. Until now, however, it was not known that among the first coins of Elis was a type with an anthropomorphic representation of Zeus. Thanks to the generosity of Dr. Bengt Thordeman, Director of the Swedish Antiquities Seryice, the Royal Coin Cabinet at Stockholm has been fortunate enough to acquire an unpublished and quite exceptional stater of Elis (Figure 3). The reverse type is a striding figure of Zeus similar to the votive statuettes already mentioned; this is surrounded by the legend "Olympikon" written retrograde in the Archaic manner. The figure, as well as the inscription, recurs in two later issues (Figure 4). Even these later coins are of the great- est rarity. The late Charles Seltman was right in dating them about 470 and to the mid-fifth century B.c., re- spectively ( The Temple Coins of Olympia [Cambridge 1921] 13, no. 37; 21, nos. 72-73). The new Stockholm coin, on the other hand, must be early because the ob- verse die, with its powerful representation of an eagle, is also found in combination with one of the earliest of the Elean reverse dies to portray a "human" figure - a Nike of traditional type - and this all-important die identity is obvious when we compare the obverse of the new Stockholm coin with that of a splendid stater from a Swiss private collection (Figure 5) and a similar one in Paris (Figure 6). According to Seltman's classification, these two coins - and consequently the new Stockholm coin as well - belong about halfway through the first phase of Elean coinage, which he has shown to extend jfrom about 510 until 471 B.c., and we shall probably not be far wrong if we place the Nike reverses at about 490. It follows that the striding Zeus of the Stockholm stater must be of approximately the same date. Important as this discovery is for the numismatist - that the striding Zeus and the "Olympikon" legend originated not in the second but in the first phase of Elean coinage - the new coin has even greater importance for the student of Greek art. Here is dramatic new evidence for the early preeminence of the theme of the striding Zeus with thunderbolt and eagle. A close study of the three successive coin issues (Figures 3, 4) reveals the broad development of Greek art during the years which the coins span. Dr. Emil Kunze has already shown how the votive statuettes follow the main development 108</page><page sequence="6">step by step. The three coin issues (each struck, it would appear, on the occasion of an Olympiad) mirror no less strikingly three stages in the transition from the late Archaic style to the "strong" style of early Classical times, which reaches its height in the sculptures of the Temple of Zeus. It cannot be overstressed that the three coin issues show a genuine stylistic development of the traditional theme, and we can no longer accept Seltman' s dismissal of the third phase as a mere "restitution," though in fairness it must be noted that the Stockholm coin had not then been discovered, and the third phase was known to him only from two poorly preserved coins of the so-called "Berlin" type. Inasmuch as the soil of Greece has only recently yielded up the new coin, is it too much to hope that one day there may be found a coin of the third phase in better condition? When this happens, it will be universally recognized that "the striding god" motif - also employed in the case of Poseidon and other deities - found its most perfect ex- pression in the period represented by this third phase of the Elean Zeus. On the basis of new material not avail- able to Seltman it has proved possible to date this third issue with considerable precision: it was struck ca. 460 b.c., that is, two or three years before the completion of the temple at Olympia. Everyone who scrutinizes these statuettes and coins which show the striding Zeus - a coin type, incidentally, which was later to be copied at many late Classical, Hellenistic and even Roman mints- must inevitably recall the only monumental statue of a striding god that has survived: the Poseidon which was recovered off Cape Artemisium by fishermen some thirty years ago (Figure 7). This famous "god from the sea," now one of the glories of the National Museum at Athens, dates exactly from the period of the latest of the statuettes and of the third of the Elean official coin types. Even though it is still not certain whether the Artemisium Poseidon is a votive statue or an actual cult image from some unknown sanctuary, there can be no doubt that it represents yet another example of the persistence of the old manner of representing the gods right down to the Classical period proper when, largely as a result of new ideas propagated by new schools of drama and poetry, the whole concept of the various deities was funda- mentally changed, with far-reaching consequences for the artists charged with their interpretation. This philo- sophical and artistic revolution, however, was still in the future when Libon built the great Temple of Zeus. It is our contention that the sanctuary was designed originally to house a monumental cult image in the same tradition, at once venerable and ancient, intensely con- servative but artistically as modern as the later bronze statuettes and the Zeus on Elis coins of the third phase. It must be admitted at once that there is nowhere any specific allusion to the existence of such an image in the cella of the Olympian temple during the quarter-century and more which was to elapse before the erection of Phidias' enthroned Zeus as "ruler of the world," a milder and less disturbing concept which is prefigured in at least one passage in Homer ( Iliad 1.528). It is possible, indeed, that a striding Zeus of this kind was never executed, either because of the lack of funds or an actual mishap in casting, or because no one could be found to undertake the casting of a statue on the scale demanded by the setting of the temple interior. The Poseidon from Cape Artemisium is nearly seven feet in height, but if it were not to be dwarfed by its surround- ings, a cult image in the Olympian temple would have needed to be at least twice that size, while the propor- tions of the Phidian replacement argue for one ap- preciably larger still. The casting of such a statue would have presented serious problems, but that it was con- templated, and perhaps even achieved, seems rather likely. A statue of the striding type would have been more appropriate to the "strong" Doric architecture of the temple's interior and to the rest of its sculptural embellishment. In fact, a statue of this description by the sculptor Hageladas of Argos is known to have been erected about 455 B.c. on Mount Ithome, in Messenia. Some idea of the appearance of this lost cult image may be gained from certain fourth- and third-century coins from Messene (Figure 8). Moreover, a striding Zeus of this description would have filled the gap that undenia- bly existed between the completion of the temple ca. 457-456 b.c. and the invitation to Phidias after his completion of the Athena Parthenos in 438. What is more, the statue postulated is one that would be entirely consistent with the beliefs and tastes of the generation immediately following the Persian Wars, the generation which had conceived and built one of the most magnifi- cent temple buildings of its time. The case for a planned striding Zeus at Olympia preceding the enthroned cult image must now be considered formidable - though it is hard to see, perhaps, how there can ever be actual proof of its existence, which would have been of compara- tively short duration.
