<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HEBREW STUDENT. BOOK+NjwIoEs. [.11 publications received, which relate directly or indirectly to the Old Testament, will be promptly noticed under this head. Attention will not be confined to new books; but notices will be given, so far as possible, of such old books, in this department of study, as may be of general interest to pastors and students.] C. H. M's NOTES.* C. H. M.'s "Notes" consist of homilies, and rarely have we found anything more wearisome. Their prolixity is tedious. They lack almost every quality of a good commentary. Their value to one who wants a work which will help him to ascertain the real meaning of the Scriptures is zero. There could hardly be found better examples of eisegesis. Many of the interpretations and statements are false. The author says that "it was the blood that made the difference, and noth- ing else," between the Israelites and Egyptians on that night when was slain the first-born in every home of the latter, and quotes Rom. III. 23. The Scriptures teach that "the blood" did not make this difference, but was only the visible sign of the different relations which these nations sustained toward God. In another place he says "that sacrifice is the basis of worship." According to the Scriptures the sole basis of worship is God's worthiness and sacrifice is itself worship. The same inexactness, confusion of terms and erroneous teachings pervade these vol- umes. They contain some truth, but it is in the proportion of one kernel of wheat to a bushel of chaff, and we are decidedly averse to doing so much winnowing. THE USE OF THE OLD TESTAMENT IN THE STUDY OF THE RISE OF OUR DOCTRINES.t In his address Mr. Duff rightly assumes that "a student of Christian theology must make himself at home in Semitic manners of life, of speech, of thought; for our Lord and the people about him, with few exceptions, were Jews. They spoke a Semitic language, Jesus spoke it, lived through it, preached in it, not in Hebrew certainly, but in Aramaic, we might almost say in Syriac. None of his preaching that we have is in the form in which he preached it, but we have a record of it in the form in which preachers repeated it in other lands in another language. Some of it, indeed, has been quite recast, we may say, for Aramaic and Greek are two radically different languages. As forms of thought they are quite different, and a thing said in Aramaic may need much change of shape before there can be a repe- tition of it in Greek. For this reason he who will know what Jesus thought and said, needs to comprehend how Semitic people think. He who will study the theology of some foreign country, will get a poor idea of it from translations of *Notes on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, 3 vols. by C. H. M., F. H.

Fortunately, the study of Old Testament He- brew gives us a good entrance to the mode of thought of Semitic peoples." Ac- cording to Mr. Duff, among the doctrines which the student for the Christian ministry should study in their Hebrew original are these: I. Divine Sovereignty, II. God's Love, iII. The Hereafter. The discussion is vigorous, very interesting and suggestive. The argument for the thorough study of the Hebrew Scriptures is especially strong. The address could be studied with profit by beginners in the history of Christian doctrines. OUTLINES OF PRIJa l'I V*, B T.T r.7P* One of the good signs of the times is the deep interest manifested in the re- lations of the world's various religions to Christianity. In no other way can its immense superiority be so fully demonstrated as by those full and fair compari- sons, the best materials for which are so amply furnished by such diligent students as Mr. Keary. His connection with the British Museum gave him access to in- formation within the reach of but few, and he has made the most of his advantages. His present work displays thorough knowledge of his theme, great skill in the management of his discussion, and admirable literary ability. He has made a most arid subject wonderfully attractive. His book is full of matured thought and valuable learning, and his investigations are arranged in the most convenient and interesting manner for the reader. He has not attempted to explain the origin of belief, but to describe its character among the Indo-European races. He gives the result of his studies of the Vedas, Homer, Hesiod, the Eddas and Sagas, and Mediaeval legends and epics. His book will prove helpful, if studied with that true mental independence which characterizes the best students. His conclusions are so largely biased by his philosophy, which we believe to be very faulty, that they must be subjected to the severest historical and logical tests before accept- ance. Thus, in his discussion of the " Nature of Belief," which occupies the first fifty pages, Mr. Keary does not undertake to say what kind of a being the first man was, though he strongly hints that he was hardly above the brute; but he is not in doubt in regard to the mental and moral natures of the primitive Aryan. These existed only in embryo, and religion was therefore devoid of all ideas of right and wrong, and bore no relation to morality. Belief was-for that matter, still is-- simply " the capacity to worship" ; and religion, as we find it, has passed through three distinct stages. "The first is the fetich-worshiping stage, when man's thoughts are concentrated purely upon visible concrete substances. The second we call the nature-worshiping stage. In it the objects of belief are still external and sensible, but they are also, in a certain degree, generalized, and are not often tangible. The third is the anthropomorphic or ethical stage, when the divinity is conceived as a being like mankind, and the ethical qualities of that being have to be taken fully into account. The reasoning by which this position is maintained is very inconclusive. For example, it does not follow that because all earliest lan- guages are rude and express their ideas in physical terms, that those ideas origi- nated through contact with the physical world. Equally illogical is the statement that " looking upward aroused some moral thoughts " which led men to endow " the high thing," a tree or mountain, with " moral qualities." Just as unsound are his other arguments for the progressive development of religion, for the evi- dence which he adduces shows that wherever we find a primitive faith, we find the notion of personality, "the voice of God in man seeking for a Personal object of worship." He, however, assumes a primitive Fetichism which has no thought be- yond the material object. *Outlines of Primitive Belief among the Indo-European Races. By Charles Francis Keary, M. A., F. S.
