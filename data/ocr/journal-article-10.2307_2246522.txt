<plain_text><page sequence="1">IIJ.-M. RENOUVIER'S PHILOSOPHY.-LOGIC. I. PHENOMENISM in some shape or other bids fair to be the philosophy of the future. Kant's Critical Philosophy impressed, as is well known, its direction on succeeding thought, and in fact has dominated its development down to the present day. Of the two strains which contended for the mastery in Kant, the</page><page sequence="2">02 .M Renoutvier's Philasophy.-;Logkc. critical seems to have preserved the greatest vigour, the- other or absolutist strain having worked itself out in both its branches. The absolute thought theory, though still sitting in isolated grandeur on sundry professorial chairs, shows no sign of re- covering its ancienlt supremacy; and the absolute will theory, though popular perhaps in the land of its nativity, has aban- doned the proper objects of philosophy, the facts of conscious perception and action, to become a philosophy of unconscious- ness and the means of attaining it. It was not till the second half of the present century that M. Renouvier, in his Essais de Critiqtue eGinrale, did for the critical strain in Kant what the German ontologists had done for the absolutist strain, that is to say, produced a complete system of philosophy on its principles, a system based at once on the disproof of noumeWal entities, of which substance and substan- tial cauise are the chief, and on the reflective analysis of the phenomena of consciousness as such, M. Renouvier has been the first to produce a complete system of philosophical pheno- menism, based on the critical principles of Kant; and it is with his name that the phenomenism of the future will be justly associated.' Nevertheless a prior name ought not to be omitted when we speak of a critical philosophy, the name of a younger contemporary of Kant himself, that of Salomon Maimon. He too was phenomenist and criticist, but he did not live to bring his philosophical system to completion.- M. Renouvier's ori- ginality, too, 'is in every way beyond question. He can in no sense be called the successor of Maimon. Their ways_ diverge widely, though it is from a point witfhin phenomenism. Both go together up to the point of complete correlation between consciousness and its objects, which is the note of phenomenism; but when they come to the analsis of phenomena within consciousness, then immediately their differences begin, differ- ences which are of a fundamental kind. They diverge as early and,they diverge as widely as, in the opposite school of. abso- lutism, Hlegel's theory of absolute thought diverges from Scho- penhauer's of xbsolute will. . Equally irreconcilable, however, they probably are not; though time alone oan show. For their differences lie in the analysis of phenomena which are open to the observation of all, and confessedly to be examined in their 1 Had I been acquainted with M.

Renouvier's Philosophy.-Logic. 33 character of phenomena, and with the aids derived from physio- logical psychology. The common acceptance of phenomenist principles is a deeper bond of unlion than any divergence on points of analysis within phenomena, however fundamental, can disturb. There are facts to appeal to, and what is more, an adrnitted method of interrogating them. Absolutism, on the other hand, supplies no bond of union at all; it is a name and nothing nmore. Each absolute system excludes every other absolutely and from the first. The importance of this fact can hardly be overrated. Pheno- menists can hail one another as allies, as co-operators in a common work, notwithstanding the widest divergences of opinion and method within that work. All such divergences, and the discussion to which they give rise, are but the necessary means of reaching a common truth, which when reached is welcome to all, being of the kind which all are alike seeking. In this respect the phenomenist philosophy is the parallel of science, where all truths are welcome, by whomsoever they are won, and. whatsoever prior hypothesis they favour or disprove. A cordial and friendly welcome, then, and at the same time an attentive examination, should be the reception given by phenomenists in this country3 to the works of the veteran philo- sopher who has been the first to propound a system of philoso- phical phenomenism, and who by loftiness of aim and dignity of thought, combined with acuteness and learning, has the most powerfully contributed to command its success. II. M. Renouvier's system is contained, up to the present time, in four works, to which he gives the title of lEssais de Critique Ge'ne'rale, the several niames of which sufficiently indicate their subject and scope. The first is the Traite' de Logique Gene'rale et de Logique Formelle, published in 1854; the second the Traite' de Psychologie Rationnelle, published in 1859; both which ap- peared again in revised and enlarged editions, each work being in 3 vols. 12mo, in 1875, to which editions the references in the present article are made. The third is Les Principes de la Nature, 8vo, 1864. The fourth is the Introdtction a la Philo- sophie Analytique de l'Histoire, of which the first volume, the only one hitherto published, appeared, 8vo, in 1864. The teni years, therefore, from 1854 to 1864, saw the foundation of M. iRenouvier's whole system. But these works have since been followed up by others of no less, indeed in one case as I venture to think, of even greater importance and value, barring always the transcending value of 3</page><page sequence="4">31 M1. Renouviqer's Philosophy.-Logic. establishing phenomenism at all. I allude to the next work which M. Renouvier published, his Science de la Morale, 2 vols., 8.vo, in 1869. Next to this came his Uchronie, in 1876, the scope of which will be sufficiently set forth, for the present, by its alternative title "An historical and apocryphal sketch of the development of European Civilisation, not as it was, but as it ?might have been". Besides. which, he is continually contributing articles on philosophical, social and political questions, to the Journal of which he is chief editor, La Critique Philosophique. Such is the general map of the Renouvier territory. Before proceeding to explore it, I will venture-the remark that, in my opinion, the crowning peak of the whole land, the glorious sunlit summit to which its roads have led him, and from Which we obtain no uncertain glimpses of the promised future of humanity, is the Science de la Miorale. That work gives promise of a better future for mankind, not only because it contains the analysis and establishment of the principles which ought to guide human effort, but also because it exhibits them in a form in which they may be pressed on the attention of practical statesmen. As I propose to examine only those two of M. Renouvier's works which are the foundation of the rest, I con- fine myself to hailing his Science de la Morale as deserving, not merely comparatively with other books, but also in a more absolute and positive sense, the distinctive title (a title devised by Coleridge) of The Statesman's Manual. But it is time to begin with the system itself It is contained in the four Essays mentioned above, and the Science de la Morale is its corollary (barring one important derogation to be men- tioned in its place). The two first Essays, the Logique and the Psychologie contain the establishment of the principles, which the third, the Nature, applies to the world of physics and bio- logy, and the -fourth, the Philosophie de l'Histoire, to the early periods of human society. The two first Essays are therefore theoretically the basis of the whole, and, as we shall see, the Logique is the basis of the Psychologie. These two contain an analysis of consciousness from two different points of view; the Logique regarding its phenomena as a subject-matter to be des- cribed and its relations determined, the Psychologie regarding the same phenomena as functions or modes of activity of consciousness, as in a given individual, the main classes of which are given in the fi-rt instance by the main divisions of the Logique. Thus both essays go over the same ground, testing and controlling each other; the mental furniture which the Logi2que analyses as the content, and the Psychologie as the functions, of the mind, being also the obverse aspect, the subjec- tive aspect as it is commonly called, of the objective universe of</page><page sequence="5">M. Benouvier's Philosaphy.-Logic. 35 existence; though it must be noted that M. Renouvier gives to the terms objective and subjective significations just the reverse of the usual ones. But this is a question of nomenclature which need not now be discussed. We may pass lightly over the first two Parts of the Logique. They are devoted principally to the establishment of Pheno- menism, the exclusion of the Absolute and of noumenal entities, in short, of what M. Renouvier well calls " fetishism in philo- sophy ". The first Part is entitled " Of Representation in general ". The most general term, which includes all other phenomena of consciousness within it, is according to M.- Renouvier repr6sentation. Each representation has a double aspect, on one side it is a phenomene representatif, on the other a phenomnene represente, or, in less technical language, a perception and a thing perceived; a distinction, it must be observed, which is a very different thing from that between a state of conscious- ness and a state of nerve on which it depends. Farther, just as the noumenal substrates, or things-in-them- selves as they are called, are excluded from philosophy, so also the Ego, the Moi, or Self, is excluded as a datuim? from the representations considered merely as such in this first Part. It will come in, when we,come to the analysis of representation in the third Part. Representations alone and in general, not any one or more particular representations, are in this first Part shown to be the proper and total object of the whole inquiry. And every representation must be taken as involving no more than its own elements, the elements composing it as a repre- sentation. The question of method comes next. The great principle by which the nonentity of noumenal substrata is proved, when the case is one where actual phenomena are treated as if they were such substrata, is what M. Renouvier calls the "principle of number," or "Cprinciple of the. finite". Actual representations, he says, treated as things-in-themselves, must either form a whole or not form a whole. If they do not form a whole, they are things which we cannot consider, under the simple relation of existence, conjointly with other things which exist. But this is incompatible with representing them at all. Therefore they must form a whole. And, if they form a whole, then, with any given whole; a number is always given. Everythincr that can enter into representation at all, even to be discussed, must form a whole with other things in representation. This, if I rightly apprehend the argument (Vol. I., p. 46), is what is intended by the "principle of number". It seems to require some further support than can be obtained from the consideration of repre- sentation in general. The notion of a wholer must have its</page><page sequence="6">36 M. 1enouvier's Philosophy.-Logic. foundation, and consequently the principle of number its proof, in the analysis of representation, which is for the present deferred. For my part, at' least, I should hesitate to admit, without further proof, what this argument seems to require, that to represent a thing conjointly with others is the same thing as representing them all together as a whole. The term whole is ambiguous. This principle M. Renouvier then applies (I. pp. 50, ff.) first to the representations of space, time, matter, and motion; and shows that to take them as things-in-themselves is to take them in a way which contravenes the principle of number, is to take them as realised infinites, either of extension or division, and vice versa. Taking the parts of space, of time, of matter, and of motion, as things-in-themselves involves takingr them as realised infinites, either in extension ad extra or in division ad intra, and that is contradictory to the principle of number. The parts of space, time, matter, nmotion, if taken as infnnite, form a number which is not a number; and to imagine that such things exist is to imagine an object to exist which contradicts the laws of representation, that is, to imagine a thing-in-itself. A discussion of Zeno's paradoxes is appended. Other groups of phenomena are then taken, ending, with the largest of all, the Sum of Things, and proof is given that, existence involving relation, a thing imagined to exist out of relation, or in other words in itself, is a nonentity. It will not, I hope, too much interrupt the current of narra- tion to remark, that the proof last mentioned seems to stand on very different ground from that on which the precediii, identi- fication of a thing-in-itself with an infinite is based. It is a perfectly general consideration that existence involves relation; but that a thing-in-itself is the same as an infinite thing requires a special analysis of the meaning of infinite. And even if an infinite thing were shown by analysis to be a con- tradiction, still it is not every self-contradictory fiction that is a thing-in-itself, which is a fiction of a particular kind. This last remark applies to M. Renouvier's conception of things-in-them- selves generally. He seerns to understand the term in an ex- tended and not in the strict sense which Kant gave it, in the section of the Kritilk d. r. V. on the ground of distinction between phenomena and noumena. (See I. 43 and 91-92.) The second Part is devoted to an ''Elementary Review of Phenomena". It is really a sequel to the first Part, containing more introductory matter, explanatory of the Phenomenist p3sition. Various terms are defined and explained; Reality, which it is shown cannot be opposed to Pheniomenon; Truth; Principle of Relativity; Law of Phenomena; Objective and</page><page sequence="7">ML Renouvier's Philosophy.-Logic. 37 Subjective Order; Subject and Attribute; Function, a termi which is employed in a sense derived from the signification it bears in mathematic, and means, in such phrases as physiolo- gical, intellectual, fuinctions, functions of sensation, memory, and so on, a " regular determination of certain phenomena con- sequent on the determination of certain other phenomnena, conformably to a law which is proper to each order and known by experience". Space and time are said to be " general func- tions of all phenomena so far as subject to the laws of quantity". Consciousness may be called "a function of functions of objective phenomena," objective meaning, in M. Renouvier's sense, as repre- sentations; and nature " a function of functions of phenomena ". The term e'tre calls for a special definition. Noumenal substance being banished, what do we mean by l'eAtre? What is a Being? It is clear that a being, an existent, implies relation and law. And the word is applied properly to all phenomenla, to relations as well as to the terms connected by them, to the law as well as to the subject of it. There seems to be a certain double sense in the word, an absolute and a relative sense; "in fact, the absolute is in some sort given in the phenomenon, namely, so far as it is simply there, present, or posited; but, so soon as posited, the phenomenon appears in a relation which may well be not this or that, but is necessarily some relation or other. Thus the phenomenon is, and the absolute disappears; or the absolute is and remains, and the phenomenon is no more, and there is nothing" . . . "The proposition the existent is, which does not go beyond its own subject, empty as a judg- ment, is equivalent to the exclamation: 0tre! representation! jphenom7ne ! It expresses the great mystery which no represeni- tation has ever penetrated or ever will penetrate; but would this miystery-if the existent were not a determinate existent, if relations were not-present itself at all ?" (1. 140.) Some remarks on existents belonging to the material, vital, and repre- sentative or conscious orders, followed by a brief section oni science and the sciences, complete the second Part. So muclh will perhaps suffice to convey an outline of M. Renouvier's position as a Phenomenist, or in other words, with regard to the general question of the nature of existence. The third Part, which contains the "Analysis of Fundamenital Laws," is naturally that to which the greatest interest attaches, at least for phenomenists, inasmuch as this analysis it is which ascertains the distinctive clharacter of the phenonienlism ex- pounded in the two foregoing Parts. All represenitations (we have seen) are in relation to others, order is traceable in all from the very first; they come to consciousness in relation witlh each other, and thereby also in relation to consciousness as a whole,</page><page sequence="8">38 M. Benouvier's Piilosophy.-Logic. and to its centre the conscious person. What are the chief or ruling relations to which they are subject? That is the great question. These relations M. Renouvier finds to be certain Categories to the number of eight, or nine if we count relation itself, each consisting of three members, a thesis, an antithesis, and a synthesis; and these Categories, involved in the representations repre6entatives, rule our thoughts, so that we find them again in the world of existences, the repre'sentations represente'es, as the laws of that world. The following is the table of them: CATEGORIES. Trabsn. ANTITHESE. SYNTHNSE. RELATION. DISTINCTION. IDENTIFICATION. DATERMINATION. Nombre UnitM Pluralite Totalite Position Point gIimite) Espace (intervalle) gttendue Succession Instanit (limite) Temps (intervalle) Dure, QualitJ Difference Genre Esp6ce Devenir Rapport Non-rapport Changement Causalite Acte Puissance Force Finalitd ttat Tendance Passion Personnclite' Soi Noin-soi Conscience 'This conception of the Categories differs from Kant's in not requiring any noumenal agent, of whose transcendental actions t;he categories may be conceived as expressions; for they exist in right of experience, as members of the analysis of actual phenomena. And it differs from Hegel's conception of the laws of thouught, inasmuch as the categories are not produced out of each other by a process of negativity, nor any one of them out of nothing by the same process. Time and Space too, it will be observed, which are Kant's forms of perception or intuition as opposed to thouight, are here made moments of the two cate- gories, position and succession. The effect of this is, first, to obliterate the distinction between perception and thought, at least as a cardinal distinction of the analysis, by sinking them in one single class of phenomena, representation; and secondly, to subordinate the forms of perception to those of thought (and not vice versa), by making the forms of that single class of phenomena, in which the distinction is obliterated, the ultimate laws of consciousness, in which the forms of perception as such are comparatively insignificant moments. The results of this will appear as we proceed. The Categories of representation being established, the re- mainder of the Logique consists in their development and application. Fronm the first or general category, that of Relation itself, with its three moments, springs the distinction between</page><page sequence="9">M. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Logic. 8'9 analytical and synthetical judgments, and the fundamental law of identity or of contradiction, together with that of "excluded middle," here called "prine'ipe de l'alternative," which are shown to be ouie in principle, and to be what M. Renouvier well calls loi r'egulatrice des relations-constantes. The next three categories, Number, Position and Succession, are then exhibited as the source and basis of matheinatic in both its branches, calculation and geometry. The discussion of posi- tion and succession contains a proof of the irreducible or ultimate character of extension and duration as features of representation. Extension and duration are not deducible one from the oth-er, nor either of them from anything else but from the category of which each is a moment. An excursus on the notion of exten- sion, appended to the chapter on position, and another on the notion of time, appended to that on succession, contain much sound and vigorous criticism on the English Association theorists. The doctrine next propounded is one to which M. Renouvier attaches great weight, and to which he frequently recurs, the non-existence of infinity in matters pertaining to quantity. " I had no right," he says " to make a category of the infinite applied to quantity, because I demonstrate that this term cannot be used without contradiction, so far as it is taken for a law of representations that are actual. While, so far as it is taken for a law of representations that are possible, the infinite is nothing, else than the indefintte, and the difference between these two words is great. The indefinite belongs to the same category as potency (puissance) or possibility." (T. 366.) 1 shall return to this point before the end of the paper; at present I go on with the Logique. Mly mathematical knowledge un- fortunately does not enable me to do justice to the mathematical disquisitions which are a capital feature of the work, with two of which, on the theory of negative values, and the theory of th-e indefinite and of limits, the first volume closes. The second volume opens with the foundation of the theory of Formal Logic on the category of Quality, with its three moments of genus, difference, and species. Logical classification accordingly comes froma the application of these three moments to the content or matter to be classified, phernomena stand in qualitative relations to each other by virtue of attributes which are predicable of them. The predicable qualities of phenomena add a concrete deterfhination to them, over and above that determination wlhich they get from simply belonging to the first or general category of Relation. "The category of quality answers the question what (quel), declares that one thing is such, and such other thing. There enters then into every repre- sentation of quality an element of distinction and an element of identifica-</page><page sequence="10">40 M. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Logic. tion. But this latter law, which is that of relation in general, receives a wholly new character and development, foreign to the preceding cate- gories, inasmuch as the quality, or thing (leclared of aniother thing,, is a genus; the object qualified a difference, and their synthesis, marked by the copula, a species." (IT. p. 2.) By calling the object qualified a difference is meant, that, in the rose is red for instance, red being the genus, the remaining qualities of the rose, other than redness, are its difference from other cases of redness. The law or category of quality, tlhen, presupposes that we see differences and resemblances in the content or matter of representation, anid that these are the basis of their classification under the three moments of the category. On this basis a complete and in many respects new theory of formal locic is developed, interspersed as before by several vigorous criticisms of various Eng,lish writers, among, others of Dugald Stewart, Sir W. Hamilton, Whewell, and De Morgan. The next Category, that of Devenir, Becoming, as opposed to Being, the German Werden, brings us into the atmosphere of concrete phenomena in their concrete shape. The preceding, categories have to do with those laws of phenomena wlicih are constant, as compared to their content; this one has for its object the concrete content itself. It is a synthesis of saineness with difference, of beinig with not-being,; that is to say, it is Change. And this notion of change is then applied to the fore- going categories. Going on to the law of this concrete change bringc,s us to the next Category, that of causality. It differs from devenir in the introduction of a new notion, that offorce. "Every representation of change is accompaniecl by a representation of force. From this niew point of view, potency in its character of the inter- val of two joined acts which determine it " [act, potency, and force, are the three moments of the category] " gives us power, if the second act is not yet posited, and gives us doing or production, if it is posited. These are two aspects of the notion of force. Under the first aspect, the force is only virtual, and the potency is as yet distinct fromi the act; under the other, the synthesis is complete, and it is force properly so calle(l which then appears, having an equal share both of the act and of the potency, which are transformed by being taken inp into a thirdl conception. In fact, whether we posit the act pure without potency, or the potency pure without act, we neither obtain change at all (devenir), nor do we obtain (loing at all (le faire), and for the same reason. Things are then represented eitler as actual or as possible, but not as producied. Act and potency, viewed in complete abstraction, are muLtually exclusive; force, foreign to each of them separately, is the result of their synthesis. Force is the act of a potency." (II. 278-9.) Such is in outline M. IRenouvier's account of the notion of force and causality in general; there is a special category of consciouisness to explain it. But this is not all. Tllere is also</page><page sequence="11">M. Ienowvioe's Philosopky.-Logio, 41 another special source from -which our knowledge of force is derived, a particular case of force, which serves us afterwards as a type for imagining other cases of causality. This is voluntary or intentional action; a fact of consciousness, of personality; "the only case in which phenomena are known to us beforehand (d'av&amp;nce) as connected by a force". (IT. 286-7.) M. Renou- vier's meaning seems to be, that the category is of general applicability, but that one class of cases only, that of voluntary action, gives--us the exemplification of this category; though other cases are brought under it afterwards by being compared to that original one. There follows under this category a treatment of the funda- mental principles of dynamics, and also of the logical modal propositions and syllogisms, of the possible, and the probable, ending with a thorough-going discussion of the theory of proba- bilities. In the next Category, that of Finalite or Final Cause, the subjective character is still more strongly marked. We have seen that human acts afforded one case of causality and force; here it is found that all final-causation is conscious. For to constitute this, there must be "default, want, need," terms which are-applicable only in the case of beings who propose ends to themselves. (TI. 459.) We find ourselves accordingly in the subjective domain of the passions, usinig this term in a large sense. The analogy between this category and the preceding one is very close. Still there is a difference which is extremely important. " Tendency (la tendance) is an interval between two states (e'tats), just as potency between two acts. But a potency includes a number, and often an indefinite number, of possibles; it comprehends contraries at the least, contraries which, whether through ignorance or otherwise, are imagined in the unknown future as connected with a deteTminlate past. But a tendency has one directioni only, simple and unique. In botlh cases there occurs a synthesis of an interval with its two limits; we have seen that two definiite acts, limiting a potency, constitute a force; similarly, two definite states, limiting a tendency, form a synthesis which we will designate by the name passion." (II. 459-60.) In this way we are brought to the last of the Categories, that of Personality, the fullest and most particular of all, as Relation, the first category, was the most general and abstract. It is supposed in all the rest, inasmuch as for analysis an anialyst, for science a savant is required; and all the forms of knowledge are nloulded on the laws of the person, who alone has the represen- tations. " Like all the categories, personality is determined by the synthesis of a linlit anid interval to correspond. The limit is the self, a sphere and a</page><page sequence="12">42 M. Benouvier's Philosophy.-logic. series of phenomena posi-ted as being, as act, as state, in the same way as the common thesis of the categories of becoming, causality, and finality, is posited. The interval, abstraction being made of all limitation by the self, is the not-self, the indeterminate, indefinite, complexus of all other or exterior phenomena, btit phenomena connected, -under all the categories, with those of self, in regard to which they are determined. The synthesis of self and not-self is consciousness, the person." (II. 484-5.) The way is thus prepared for the subject of the next Essay, the Psychologie, which treats of the various functions of con- sciousness; and (as already remarked) reproduces the categories in an active shape or as functions. Consciousness is not itself relation but a relating, " relation r eferente "; and so also, under the next four categories, it is a numeration, an imagination, a memory, a judgment, all which compose the general fuclction of intelligence or understanding, and (supposing the category of becoring to be involved, as it inevitably is) of thought. As subject to becoming, too, consciousness is also will and passion, which are the active states of causality and final-causation. The three main divisions of psychology are thus given, under- standing (including sensibility), will, and passion. Still in some sort even here we are yet in the kinigdom of forms; the cate- gories are forms, the " skeleton of representations," and so also are the functions. We suppose the matter in and upon which these forms of both kinds are displayed. This matter, consist- ing of phenomena which do not give buit range themselves under the categories, and which the categories do not give but arrange-this matter so arranged is experience; and inasmuch as consciousness with its forms is the arranger, experience is a name also for consciousness. (II. 488.) But we have not yet arrived at the. end of the Logique. There are certain conclusions to be drawn from the analysis, certain results relating to our conceptions of the frame of things, which the Logique by itself is sufficient to warrant. Indeed it is here, in the fourth and concluding Part of the work, which deals with the Limits of Knowledge, that the immediate interest of the whole is found. What are these conclusions ? The form which the 1ait Part takes is that of discussing the possibility of an universal and scientific synthesis comprehending the pheno- mena of the universe at large. " Can science solve the general questions which are posed when she applies the categories to experience, or in other words to the World? Is an uztique and total synthesis of phenomemna possible ? " (III. 7, 8.) The answer, as we shall see, comes briefly to this. No such synthesis is possible for scientific knowledge; but there is possible existence beyond that knowledge, which escapes the reach of synthesis, and is the legitimate object of beliefs. There is a region which belief may people with probable phenomenal</page><page sequence="13">M. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Logic. 43 existences, enveloping a region which can conceivably (though not so at present) be entirely reduced to the synthesis of know- ledge. Now there are two ways in which this conception of a region of the world of existence, beyond the reach of scientific synthesis, may be imagined. Either that region is imagined as infinite, and then the world as a whole is imagined as infinite also; or it is imagined as finite, and then we imagine a finite synthesis of knowledae, surrounded by an unknown region indefinite to us, and the whole lying within a finite universe. Which of these two ways is adopted by M. Renouvier? The way in which he approaches the subject is the, following. There is, he says, a discrepancy in our conceptions of the world as a Total, according as we approach it directly by the categories, or from the suggestions of our actual experience. When we take the latter course, and endeavour to follow up experience as far as it will carry us, we find in every direction, a Beyond; phenomena seem to lead us to an infinite under all the cate- gories; we seem to have a limited experience of an unlimited world. On the other hand, when we apply the categories directly to phenomena, the world is conceived in all directions as a finite whole, with nothing beyond it either in space, time, or anything else. Is the world, then, finite, or is it infinite? This is a real antinomy, which must be solved, if knowledge is to be a reality, by showing that one branch is true, the other false, and why. M. Renouvier's solution is, that the result of following experi- ence, the infinity of the wor-ld, is attained by means of a gene- ralisation or induction which may be illegitimate; while the result of applying the categories directly, the finiteness of the world, not only results from a necessity of thought, but is niot contradictory, either in itself, or to the inductions of experience so far as they legitimately go. The infinity of the world is contradictory to its finiteness, but its finiteness is not contra- dictory to the indefinite limits of experience, which is all that experience can legitiniately assert. " The theatre of experience is the contett of the world, and the world exceeds it." (III. 21.) "In one word, experience does not prove that nothing, is possible, beyond experience, or limiting the sphere of possible experience. On the contrary, the conception of the Whole perishes, and phenomena drift without anchorage, if the infinite, the true name of which is contradiction, obtains a footing in scientific knowledge." (III. 22.) The antinomy is thus shown to be real, and at the same time receives a solution in the sense of finiteness.

Renouvier's Philosophy.-Logic. thing-in-itself doctrine, that the dispute is a dispute about nothing at all, and (2) of upholding the Theses in all four cases. M. Renouvier thus conceives the world or sum of things as a finite whole, with no time before it or after it, no space outside it; but as containing within itself an unknown region beyond the reach of scientific knowledge, a region which we know to exist, and to exist in relation to the known region, the cate- gories of representation being applicable alike to both. Experi- ence is satisfied by having a beyond assured to it; anid the categories are satisfied by that beyond being conceived as finite. This beyond is the reoion of possibles and of belief, of reality but not of knowledge, except so far as this, that we know it is subject to the categories. There is, then, beyond the synthesis of experience, an indefi- nite and comparatively unknown reg,ion, which is marked out by the categories, the laws of all representation. This region as a wlhole is determined by the categories, that is, not by extrinsic but by intrinsic concditions. And no sylnthesis of experience of the world as a whole is possible, because experience implies relation of one fact or phenomenia with others beyond it, whereas the world has notlhing either beyond it or beside it. (III. 10.) But since we have a general knowledge of the world as a whole, having the categories which determine it, the question occurs whether we have not also, in the categories, data for deducing the phenomena within our experience, anid so in a general way arriving at a scientific synthesis of the phenomen-a of the world, including, the unknown region; a syinthesis which would be a deductive and scientific synthesis of general laws, thoug,h one with great lacunie, and not to be called a synthesis of experience. "In order for such a science truly accessible to exist, we should necessarily have to conlceive the unique and total synthesis as attained and possessed, at least in hope, so that analysis should find its mission in deve- loping by deduction from this function of all relations" [viz., the idea of the world as an anticipation of the synthesis] "a result adequate to its content " [viz., the world itself]. (III. 22.) It reinains, then, to show- that we have not, in the idea of the world given by the categories, such an anticipation of synthesis or "function of all relatioins" as would furnish data for the required deduietion; that is, that we have not, even inl hope, tlhe unique and total synthesis in question. Arid this -M. Renouvier proceeds to do, by taking the categories in detail, and comrparing them with the results obtained or obtainable by following up the line of experience. In the three categories of number, position, and succession, the world as a whole is subject to the categories, that is to say,</page><page sequence="15">M. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Logic, 45 it consists of a finite number of phenomena, a finite extent in space, and a finite durationi in time. Buit then we do not know what these finites are; they are known to us only as indefinites. On the other hand, the question, Why this number, this extent, this duration, and not others, is a question we have no right to ask. Divisibility in phenomena is also shown siinilarly to be finite and not in infinitum; the problem of several similar worlds is discussed; the vacuum is maintained in opposition to the plenum. In this part of the work, agrain, powerful criticisms are interposed on Hamilton, Mill, Mr. Spencer, and M. Vacherot. (III. pp. 35 to 114.) Wlhen we come to the category of quality, the result is somewhat differelnt. The world clearlv falls under the cate- gories of number, position, anid succession, that is, it is a finite number, extent, and duration, of phenomena. But it does not fall in the same sense under the category of quality. It is not a species at all. We must inideed say that it is a genus with regard to its internal species, or that it is a species of species, all differences included; but this is not to determine the world as a species; it is merely to defilne it in the technical terms of the category. Its determination analytically or a posteriori is im- possible, because here we are debarred from using the moment of difference, all differences being already included in the Whole. It is therefore no datum for a synthesis. Again, to determine the world as consisting ultimately of one or of several species would be to refer it to so mnany substances out of which, or causes by means of which, it has become what we see it. We should in this way pass out of the category of genus and species. (III. 116.) An excursus is devoted to the subject of transfor- mations of force, and a chapter is given (after examining the next category, that of becominq) to show that the evoluition theory cannot carry its subsumption of species under the head of development to the point of abolishing species altogether, without at the same time abolishinig all knowledge whatever. In other words, the category of quality, with its moments of genus, difference, and species, is a necessity of thought. At the same time it gives us no hint what, or how many, are the separate existences with which the world begirns. The case with the category of Becoming is the same as with those of number, position, and succession. The general conclu- sion applicable to all alike, as well as to that of quality, is, that representation by the categories is the rule of experience, and consequently extends by anticipation to the totality of its phenomena. But the extreme limit, which we are thus com- pelled to posit, is not a thing which can itself be limited. It cannot therefore be defined; and is no datum for the total</page><page sequence="16">43 M. Benotnvier's Philosophy.-Logic. synthesis. In other words, the categories are the -alpha- and omega of knowledge and of existence; they present us with a finite world, the limits of which are fixed, but cannot without contradiction be defined, by representation. (III. 152.) The three last categories hang closely together; questions raised under the first are referred to the second, and thence to the . third, for an answer, and only -under the third is a perfect synthesis shown to be impossible. To begin with the first of the three. The notion of an uncaused cause or causes is forced upon us by the category of number applied to that of becoming; we are compelled to assuLime one or mnore catusal phenomena, or rather forces (since potency and act are never isolated, but always combined into force as already shown). These are posited as existing without antecedents, and as the conditions of existence-of subsequent given relations. (III. 181, 187.) Nor is this spontaneous existence to be confined to the beginning of the world. "We are ignorant," says M. Renou- vier, calmly, and without betraying any sense of the insecurity which such a fact would introduce, into all sequences, " whether phenomena entirely new and independent (without any bond with those which now are or have been), can or can not super- vene". (III. 181.) In discussing the question whether there is a law of universal pre-determination of phenomena, or whether there is a real contingency in nature (which great question is passed on to the succeeding -categories), M. IRenou- vier says, that, if all or any future events are in fact uncertain, armbiguous, unforeseeable by any consciousness whatever, then the determination of one possible event, to the exclusion of others, is a title of real individuality f6r the forces by which the determination is effected; they are free forces, and to the extent to which they determine possibles are veritable first forces. (III. 194). Reserving however for the moment this question, he concludes, after an elaborate discussion (III. 191- 192), that the probabilities are in favour of more first causes than one, but in interdependence on each other. Clearly, how- ever, no coimplete synthesis of the world is hereby placed within our reach. The category of final cause leads us to attempt the synthesis of the world by positing an ultimate final cause or causes of all phenoinena, which would be a closing lirnit, as a first cause is a commencing limit, of phenomena as a whole. The necessity, however, of an ultimate end, in time, of phenomena is not so certainly established as that of a first beginning is; for it is not, like that, established directly by the principle of contradictionl. The events to which it relates are ex hypothesi future; and the contradiction which lies in an actually realised infinity is there-</page><page sequence="17">M. Benouvier's Philosophy.-Logic. 47 fore avoided by the notion of an endless succession into the future. But it is none the less incomprehensible on that account. (III. 198, 199.) We are therefore led to assume the more comprehensible view of a final limit to the world in time. (lb. 198-201.) Here we are agoain brought to, the question of indeterminism or real contingency. Seeing that the first cause must be re- garded, when we bring in the notion of passion, that is, of conscious desire, as existing in virtue of an end, the question arises, whether the whole order of events originated by the first cause, in view of the ultimate end, is predetermined by its cause and its end together; or may the end be missed ? How is the cause determined by the end, and are the ends one or several, acting together or acting, apart ? (Ib. 201-204.) It is clear that we can get no total synthesis from this category, but must have recourse to that of Consciousness. But even under the category of consciousness, our hopes, if we ever had any, are doomed to disappointment. M. Renou- vier shows by a series of subtil reasonings, wlhich cannot 'be condensed or summarised without grievous loss of their weight and vigour, and which take us deep into the questions which cluster round the conceptions of cause, creation, cavsa sni et mundi, fate and free-will, foreknowledge absolute, and others of similar profundity, that neither the hypothesis of one, nor that of several, conscious beings can enable us to attain the desired synthesis of the world of phenomena. He himself prefers the hypothesis of several, for " we cannot hold our footing in that of unity, and so soon as we succeed in rendering it intelligible, we find that we halve passed over into the other hypothesis ". Though we must admit that a synthesis exists, it is a synithesis inaccessible to us. Still M. Renouvier goes so far as to say that "Leaving in its inaccessible obscurity the question of pure origins, we affirm that the first datum for science is a plurality of consciousnesses; a-nd this miight, in strictness, pass for a solution of the problem which philo- sophy putrsues. We reject the pretensions of metaphysic. We affirm a first commencement of all things; butt the-n that is to posit a limit, not to open the field to absolite knowledge. We declare for the impossibility of conceiving, either in their unity or in their plurality, the primitive terms which are imposed by logic on the development of the facts of existence. It is thus and in this senise only, that the law of the multiplicity of con- sciousnesses cani offer itself as a solution-a solution which has nothing in common with that universal synthesis, the conditions of which we set out-to seek." (III. 241.) The whole chapter concludes thus.- "We come to this as our definitive conclusion:, The total synthesis of phenomena, so far as it is a first datum, is withdrawn'from knowledge and from. science. It existed nievertheless, it existed determinately under all</page><page sequence="18">48 1. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Logic. the relations, in its own nature, conformably to the categYory of number, without which neither speculation nor thougrht is possible. "The actual synthesis, which embraces past phenomena in its sphere, is determined for the samne reason; it is a datumn, but it is not a datum for science, nor can it be so. It admnits of a plurality of consciousnesses, and that is all we know of it. "The synthesis bearing on the future could only be a datuim so far as phenomena, of wliatever kindl, should be in strict dependence on antece- dent phenomena, which is their pre-determination. But we know not whether the world is subject to such a law, and if it is Inot, we must then say that the total synthesis, in respect to the future, is, and has been at every epoch, an idea without foundlation for every possible consciousness." (Ib. p. 245.) Courage, reader! There remain but two and twenty pages duodecitno to compass, and those few pages contain the harvest of all that has gone before, and will give us a broad outlook over the whole field of philosophy an-d its divisions, as conceived by our author. M. R11enouvier has fully attained his purpose in the whole precedincg discussion on a total scientific synthesis, thoug,h I am painfully aware of the inadequacy of my brief rendering to represent its power and completeness. But why is M. Renouvier anxious to show that no scientific synthesis is possible ? It is to break with absolutism in philosophy oince and for ever; to show how and why it is that he has no part nor lot with a priori constructions of the universe, overriding experiment and induction, whether of ani idealistic or material- istic type; in short, to prove himself a genuinie phenomnenist. The need for this, I will add, was the greater because he adopts the theory of cateaories, or laws of thought as opposed to per- ception, which had already led, in Germany, to an idealistic absolutism. That, I take it, is the main purpose of the long disproof of a total scientific synthesis. But this being done, there remain the questions relating to the indefinite unknown region beyond experience, but within the categories. These questions have niow to be treated. We do not get rid of this region of the world, or of the questions relating to it, by slhowilng that the scientific synthesis of the world as a whole is impossible. Indeed these questions are the specially plhilosophical ones in a phenomenist system. The purpose of plhilosophy, says UM. Renouvier, has always been defined, by its necessary practice, as an inquiry concerning God, man, liberty, immortality, and the first laws of the several sciences, all questions which hang closely together, and which, even if no science of them were possible, would still offer a field to criticism, in order to prove that it was not. For this reason he has excluded the word philosophy from the title of these Essays.</page><page sequence="19">1!. Benouvter's Philosop7Ay.-1Logi. 49 The sciences differ from philosophiy (still it is M. Renouvier who speaks) in that each of them places its own principle or first- law beyond the field of its own researches; whereas philosophy has principles, and its own among the rest, as its proper object of research. There is thus a circle in philosophy, seeing that it must employ the very principles which it seeks to establish in the act of establishing them. It replaces the vague and confused syntheses, which serve as its data, by definite syntheses wlhich are its results. If it can, so- to speak, make both ends meet, by showing that its, definite results are the harmony of its vague data, then it is entitled to postulate the assent of mankind. Uncertainty to some extent there must always be in human speculation, but both its kind and its degree are to be determined severally for different problems, and in the first place by the division of knowledge to which they belong. The limits of knowledge as a whole are disclosed by finding its general laws, which has been done in the present Essay; and this branch of knowledge, a work of criticism, now takes the place of the old and untenable universal science which used to be called philo- sophy. Under this come the several special sciences, some logical, some of observation or experiment; but all limited by the data which are proper to each, on the one hand, and by the verifiability of their inductions on the other. Criticism again will have its place in the interval between their results and the extreme limits of existence defined by the categories. (III. 246-250.) Such are the negative results of our analysis; results which are by no means negative in their consequences. The old schools and- the old theories vanish-spiritualism, materialism, pantheism, the idols -of the infinite, of substance, of substantial causes. " Mind (esprit) and matter are but names applied to a classification of phenomena in the rough (grossiere). The de- termination of facts of every order, and of their laws, replaces the search for entities. Existents (e'tres) are laws." (III. 251.) Things-in themselves, too, are no more. On the other hand, ^"it is no longer allowable to affirm deliberately that the individual hias no durable existence; that personality is a transient illusion, not a constant law that man is swallowed up in nature, and humanity with him; or that this present and perishable humanity is the culminating product ;Lof the world's d-evelop- ment." (lb.) Thus we find that, accordingt to M. Renouvier's theory the immortality of living beings is no longer an impossibility, though, or rather because, it is no longer made to depend on the notions of soul or of substance. The unknown region of thought beyolld 4</page><page sequence="20">50 Z. Renouvier's PhilosopJty.-4logic. the actual synthesis of science guarantees at least its p6ssibility. We can now, too, see the true and the false senses in which the term Atheisrm has been and still is so often applied. God, as conceived under the terms of an antiquated theology, can no longer be the object of our belief. That shell of the divinity is broken. But the same unknown region of thought, which is the field of legitimate beliefs, recognised as -such by science, and which makes a future life possible to thought, is also the ground on which we can securely seek the divine author, or authors, of the world as known to us. In brief, "an order of possibles, objects of the belief which reason authorises, remains secure, and exists beyond the laws which reason imposes or science determines. We now know what criticism forbids, what pre- tensions it ruins, what hopes it permits. We have next to ask, whether criticism has not a part to play on the stage thus reserved for speculation; whether, in the in'termediate region between the special sciences and the analysis of first principles, there is not a place for a General Science in a new and legitimate form." (III. 258.) This last question introduces M. Renouvier's special doctrine concerning the articulation, if I may use the word, of philosophy. A new career is to be opened for a general science, without en- croaching on- the special sciences, and in dependence on the abstract science of the Logique. Where and how will this new territory be carved out ? We have seen that there is an un-- kniown domain of thought beyond the reach of science; we have now to remark that there is a certain set of problems, belonging to phenlomena on this side science, which no special science as yet undertakes to treat. These problems are all of a practical character, and relate to matters which, though not lying wholly in an unknown domain, are yet equally matters of probability and of belief rather than of demonstration. We may consider them as marking out a domain in the phenomena of actual life. Join the two doinains, and we have the field of M. Renouvier's new general science; lying, as it were, astride of the barrier between science and belief. The problems which he speaks of are these, and they are italicised in his pages: "What are we to think of the proximate origin and proximate destiny of the special phenomena manifested in a consciousness ? " [Tmmortality]. "More generally, can we admit a certain order of the world as referred to coxisciousness ? " [Moral government of the world]. " Is it allowable to suppose a human individual destiny, a law of development of personality, aid under what conditions ?" [Nature of the future state]. "Up to what point are the principles of ethic and of the foundation of States involved' in the solution of these questions ?' [Dependence of moral and political practice on the unknown domain]. (III. 260.) The foregoing amounts to nothing short of sketching out a scheme, and that on a philosopliical basis, in which the questions</page><page sequence="21">M. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Logic. 51 that concern man individually and socially are to be treated in connexion with the invisible world, instead of being left, as they now are, to be fought for by theologians on the one hand and those who deny, or at least abstract from, the existence of the invisible. In this consists its immense practical importance. We have here a philosophy which has special practical results. Two things are gained by this distribution: (1) morals, includinog social and political practice, are brought under the sanctions of the invisible world; and (2) we judge the nature and character of the invisible world chiefly by our own moral nature, and no longer solely by our intellectual faculties and acquirements. At the same time it must be admnitted, I think, that philosophy is brought into possible collision with special science in one part of the field, on which it would not be in collision with it if a stricter limitation of the province of philosophy were adopted. I mean the domiains, not of morals, for they are clearly a de- pendency of the analysis of consciousness, but those of physical science on the one side and of the philosophy of history, includ- ing the origins of civilisation, on the other; in short, the two fields covered by M. Renouvier's third and fourtlh Essays. On his view of the new general science he is boun-d to have theories in these domains, and thus comes into collisioni with other theories, for instance, with Mr. Spencer's Evolution theory; which on a stricter view of what pertains to plhilosoplhy would be avoided, philosophy being then conceived as indifferent to questions of history, whether physical or lhunman. Turning to this new general science, the question is, wlhat are the first steps towards taking possession of the new domain. The first necessity, says M. Renouvier, is to study consciousness in action, "man as a function of the cateoories," man no longer as a contenit of thought and feeling, but as thliniking, feeling, acting; the microcosm not the macrocosrmi; in short to enter on a Psychology which shall be the conlplement of the Logique. We shall then have before us, as our object of research, aim individual human consciousness, but one takeni as a represen- tative of all; and this, the first step we take, is the step from the general science of the Logique, the method of which is demonstrative and analytic, to the most general branch of the new science, which must proceed by the method of hypothesis and induction. The generalisation of the plhenomena of the inquirer's individual consciousness is in fact the first step into the domain of beliefs and probabilities. And here it must be noted that, if the Logique lhad succeeded in establishing what it is the tendency of philosoplly to aim at, a complete total synthesis, no need and at the same tiine no room would have existed for such a science of probabilities as</page><page sequence="22">52 if. PRenouvier's Philosophy.-Logic. we now must descend upon. Every result that followed wotuld thlell have followed as a deduction from that synthesis. There would have been an absolute system of philosophy embraciincg and determining the phenomena of all the special sciences. This pretension being, abandoned, the only course open is a scientific, but not absolute psycnology; and the first question to occur in that psychology will relate to the nature and conditions of certitude. But it will also be remeinbered that one problenm remains over from the Logique, which has been passed on from category to cate- gory, and has never miiet with a solution, the problem of deter- mninism: Is there real cointinigency in the world, or is everything that occurs or will occur governed inevitably and universally by antecedent laws, without the possibility of modification ? The question of certitude depends on this problem, says M. Renouvier, more than is generally imagined; and a new light will be thrown upon both questions by the new psychology, the Critique do l'Hornrne. In fact we shall find, that the two nmain problems treated in the Psychologie JRationnelle are those of Liberty andl Certitude; " for the question is" (and these are the concluding words of the Logique) "to know how a man can attain aild ascertain truth indepelndently anid beyond the limits of his own actuial and individual consciousness." III. Such are the outlines of a philosophy, or rather of the basal work of a philosophy containing an outline of the rest, wlhich will, if I mistake not, and so far as it founds a system of Phenomenism, impose its law and its directioin on the next epoch of philosophic thought. I say only so far as it founids a system of phenomenism, for the work which we have just gone throughli falls into two very distinct portions, the phenomenism of the first two Parts having no necessary connexion with the analysis of the phenomnena of consciousness by Categories, which occupies the third Part, and is applied to the interpretation of phenomena generally in the fourth. The phenomenism may stand, and the anialysis fall. The analysis seems to me open to serious objections, objections which looked at solely from an analyst's point of view appear enormous, fatal to the system, but which yet, from a practical point of view, sink into utter insig,nificance. I mean that they are insignificant when we consider how independent of that analysis phenomenis m really is; how independent of it also that doctrine of phenomenismn is which maintains the existence of an Invisible World in relation witlh our own; and, moreover, when we take</page><page sequence="23">A. Renouiie/s Philosophy.-Jogic. 53 into account the possibility of replacing it by one more searching, not only without weakening but with positive addition of strength to the general phenomenist theory. The question of analysis by categories is a question within phenomenism, and may be answered in different ways without destroying the union of phenomenists in developing that general theory. From this point of view I will venture with diffidence to state my objections to that analysis, not purposing to examine it at length, still less pretending to refute it. I wish rather to call attention to this great work of M. Renouvier's, to claim for it due recognition and careftlL examination by others, being convinced that in this way alone the interests of truth can be served. Besides it is necessary for phenomenism that its analytical portion should be placed on a perfectly secure footing, beyond -the reach of scepticism and of atomism. For by phenomenism I mean, of course, philosophical phenomenism, not that rope of sand, that psychology in masquerade, an.d negation of philo- sophy, wbich regards consciousness as consisting of isolated atomis of th:ought, lHumian impressions and ideas, bound to- gether by the Laws of Association. If this is phenomenism, it is certainly not philosophy; and eveni phenomenism it appears to be only because it makes no use of the notions of noumenal suibstance and efficiency, not because it disproves their existence. What then are the objections? In the first place, what M. Renouvier calls an analysis into categories is not analysis, but an arrangement of the facts under heads which are, it is true, well known notions in actual use, but none of which are ultimate elements of thought. It is an arrangement of a double kind, first of phenomena under the nine categories, secondly of three mutually relative conceptions under each category; and this certainly simplifies the phenomena by classifying them in an easy and convenient order. But the categories themselves are as much in need of analysis, as the phenomena are when not so arranged. There is not one of the categories, or of the conceptions composing it, which is not resolvable into simpler elements; these elements being some mode or other of feeling or sensibility, some duration of time, and, in the case of feelings of sight, touch, and sense of resistance (whether separately or combined), some extension in space, together with that particu- lar feeling, or sense, of effort in attention, which is the mark of what we call volition. The formal elements in the categories, abstracting from their content of feeling other than the feeling of effort--and it is as purely formal that M. Renouvier regards them, calling them for instance tlle "skeleton of representa- tions "-are thus reduced to three kinds, that of space, that of time, that of volition. And of these the modes of time and the</page><page sequence="24">54 M. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Logic. nodes of space are formal elements in states of consciousness before volition modifies them; are elements of perceptions, before these perceptioins are modified by volition into thoughts. If this conception could be carried out, we should lhave a real and, so far as it went, explanatory analysis of conscious- ness; real, because into constituent parts more elementary than the things analysed, and explanatory because an approach to determiiingc the primary springs of consciousness, at the point where it issues from its conditions of existence, the properties and powers of nerve-substance, before its development into distinct functions and faculties. But no sucll approach is made by M. Renouvier's anialysis. Take for instance the category of Causality, wlhich is the nlame for the three conceptions, act, potency, force, taken together. This is an arrangement, not an analysis into elements more elementary than the thing analysed. To begin with the included conceptions. Force is not analysed by saying that it consists of the combined notions of act and potency, for these require the notion of force for their own intelligibility; each of them includes force, just as much as force includes them; act also is a relative term to potency, and eaclh must be understood pari passu witlh the other. Buit this is not an analysis of the relation between tlhem; it is a mere statement of it. So neither is the relation between the three terms an analysis of causality, but a statement of the relation to be analysed. Puitting for- ward such statements as an analysis of phelnomena amounits to admitting that the relations entitled categories cannot be analysed; whereby they come back agTain into objective nature as entities, just as nmchl as if they were called by that name. Unfortunately M. Renouvier makes no distinction between perception and thought. He calls both, taken tog,ether, by the common name of representation. And the consequence is, that he does not distinguish the two kinds of formal elements in thoughts, but only inquires what are the ultimate modes which are assunmed by combinations of the three kinds; a category beina tlle combination of some formal element or elements of perception with attention, whlich is the formal element turning, perceptionis into thougyhts. The categories are tlhus not an analysis of con- sciousness in its formal elemuenit, but a classification of the combinations of the formal elemenits in thought, whichl are in actual use in reasoning. They have consequenitly no title to be the foundation or criterion of truth in plhilosophy or criticism. Consequently, too, they are no sufficient reply to the Associa- tionists. That tlheory cannot be answered by pointing to the inseparability of relatives in thought, but only to thlat of the ultimate elements in pre-volitional representation. For it would</page><page sequence="25">M. Benouvier's Philosophy.-Logic. 55 still be open to them to urge, that the law of inseparable asso- ciation had been employed in producing the apparent insepara- bility of relatives in thought, namely, by supposing, them to have been originally isolated in perception; whereas tlley are precluded from this, if it can be shown that the smallest and simplest perceptions, at the moment they cross the " threshold " of consciousness, are states of consciousness containiing distinguish- able but inseparable elements, some of which (the formial) are carried on into the adjacent perceptions, so as to bind thein all into a single chain from the very first. The Association theory requires the assumption, that perceptionis are originally isolated; then and then only is there room for the theory. This assump- tion it is which a philosophical phenomenism is challenlged to overthrow. M. Renouvier seems to have a remarkably firm grip of the truth of phenomenism, but, were it not so, his theory of the categories as an ultimate analysis of consciousness would seriously endanger it. It is in fact the very route out of Kantianiism followed first by Fichte and thein by Hegel. I do not mean that they framed a theory of Categories, but that they adopted the form of thought instead of the form of perception as their guiding, principle. this is common to them with M. ltenou- vier. In speaking of Being, too, he sometimes speaks Kanit's and Fichte's lang,uage. " ttre c'est poser," he says at one place (III. 200); anid in the Psychologie we find him showing that being is ajfirimation, which is thorouglly Fichtean. Takeni in. a full unlimited sense, uncorrected by the co-existingt fact that we canniot posit or affirm, nor yet abstain from positing or affirming, at our pleasure, such phrases as these are slheer idealistic abso- lutism. It is true that to the perception of existence there gToes attention; but that is far from being the wlhole of tlle percep- tion. And in fact we abstract from this attention when, after it, we assert that the perceived thing exists. It is wlhat we cannot htelp seeing, touching, hearing, and so oni, that we say exists. Our affirming it does not make it. Existence is a per- ception. The affirmation of an existence whichl is niot forced on the perceptioni is a belief. There is another doctrine also of prime importance which M. Renouvier shares with the post-Kantian absolutists, one which strikes still lharder at the root of phenomenism than the analysis already criticised, and is a consequence of it. He holds that self-consciousness is a necessary element or condition of sensibility; which is a consequence of the category of personality. It comes out first clearly in the 1Psyc7hologie (Vol. I. p. 6), where he says, speakiing of this category, "witlh- out permonal representation, no sensible represen-tationi would</page><page sequence="26">56 M. IRenouvier's Philosophy.-Logic. subsist ". Vere it not for his combining, somewhat incon- gruously as it seems to me, a system of thorough-going plheno- menism with this absolutist analysis, lie would occupy miuch the same position as Ferrier of St. Andrews, whose lnstitites of Metaphysic, published in 1854, the same year as M. lienouvier's Logiqte, gives a complete correlation of objective anld subjective aspects, but includes the same absolutist notion, namely, of self- consciousness beingt a condition of consciousness anid not vice versa. Ferrier never worked out hiis Institutes into a comuplete system, so that we cannot tell whlat the effect of tllis notion would lhave been in his case; M. Renouvier has managed to frame a phenomenistic system in spite of it. Still it seems to me, that the stability of the system is seriously endangered thereby. And after all the chief point is, not so muich to lhave a phenomenistic system, as to have a logrical and imlpreg,nable one. Chanres like those sugTgested in ultimate analysis, especially if our viewNvs on Being and Self-consciousness altered conjoinltly, would involve ftirther changes of great importance for a pheno- menist system. In tlle first place, what shall we think of Infi- nity? Ancd here I am in part replying, to a criticisrn wlich i \I. P.enouvier did me the honour to mnake in La Critiqte Pitiloso- phi_que for Nov. 30, 1876. Al. Pienouvier seems to lhave no otlher notion of tlhe infinite than as a realised infinite, which he rightly says is a contradiction. But there is sometlhing between this and the indefinite, the validity of wlhich notioni hle asserts. He seems to think that we can affirm lnothing to exist which we cannot in thought see all round, as it were, or which is not conceive(l as a whole. Consequently hiis indefinites all lie within the uniiverse conceived as a vast but finite wlhole. The reason of this is, that his categories are forms of thlough1t, not perception, and all tlhoucght is limitation. But if we take the forms of perception, time and spatial extension, as ouir ultimates, then we shall find that iinfinity is involved in all perception. Every perceived thing, which is a portion of tiIme or of space, has time or space beyond it. The perception that this happens always, wherever you lhave a per- ception, th?is is the infinity of time and space; it does not involve a process, or going on to see whethler, or wlhere, you will be brought to a stop; it is not, as M. PRenouvier says, a restult of an induction wlhich may turn out invalid; but it is the perception that time and space have and can have no final boundary, that is, one without time or space beyond it. This is a perception wlich, so far from involving, entirely excludes the thought of a realised infinite. Yet it is not an indefinite. T'liat is the product of the process in infinitum; you go on without</page><page sequence="27">Mt. Renouvier's PhilosopAy.-Loyic. 57 knowing whetlher or wlhen you will come to &lt;an enid; and this is only possible in concrete cases, not witlh timiie aincl space in abstracto. Yet time and space are not tlhus treated as thinigs- in-themselves; they are merely treated as formis of perception, instead of forns of thought. The term indefinite mlay be defined as that which has no known end; the termi itf'tnfite as that which has no possible end. Just as tlle finite is that wvliiclh has aind must have an end; the definite that wlliclh has a known end. Applying this to the Invisible World, those wlho take my view of ultimate analysis would adopt the first of the two ways, mentioned above, of imaginingi the unknown region beyond the synthesis of science, that of imagining it inifinite ad extra, anld not in M. Renouvier's way of conceiving it as vast blut finite. This, however, gives rise to no practical difference, since we cannot practically treat the imagined inifinite but by emiiployiing thought upon it, that is, conceivingr limits ever fartlher and fartlher oft; tlhus turning it inito an indefinite. The ideal exis- tences, which we imagine as belongying, to it, muiist be miiadeI indefinites by the mere circumstance that we try to conceive them; of which effort to conceive, the imnagination of the infinite is a condition. But Al. Renouvier's finite world, that world whiclh we may picture as a vast but closed and hollow sphere, the surface of which is defined by the categories, threatens to be too small for him at one point. It bulges at the Possibles. If he holds, as we know fronm the Psycholoyie he does hold, the doctrine of a real inideterimiinism as the basis of a real liberty of will, tllen the closed circuLit of the categories bursts at that poinlt. Real con- tingency is the aLWetpov, has no bounds, and cannot be imiiaginied to exist in a finite world. Indefiniteness, which is merely the absence of known bounds, is no satisfaction to the clainis of real indetermiinationi. Beyond that indetermination whiicl depends upon ouir ig,norance, there is, it is held, a real limiait; anjd yet in the world, so limited, there is real indetermlinatioln. How cain this be made to harmonise ? Not that the imagination of an inlfinite world shows real inidetermination to be true. Far from it. It gives scope for it only, if it should be held true on other g,rounds; whereas a finite world gives no scope for it at all. The infinite gives scope also for an infinite determination; but it does not decide between the two. It sets indeterminism free, and the gift of infinity is not to be despised. The analysis of ultimates proposed above, in lieu of the categories, will also be found to have a direct bearingr on the questions of certitude and liberty which are treated more fully</page><page sequence="28">58 M1. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Logic. in the Psychologie. Indeed there is no part of philosophy wlhere important differences do not result, according, as we adopt the one or the otlher view of ultimate analysis. It is not here the place to enter on these questions. One word, however, on another point connected with the unknown region, before briningiii this paper to a close, I mean M. Renouvier's rehabilita- tion of polytheism. It is in the unknown or intermediate recion of thought, limited ad extra by the categories, and lying between that external limit and the still more limited interior splhere of scientific synthesis, that the gyreat problems of philosophy are met with, which, according to MI. Renouvier, are Klant's well known three-Liberty, Immortality, and God. Reg,arding, the third, the question is-One or several ? And here we see at once that the hypotlhesis of several harmonises perfectly witl that of several causes of the world, and that several causes are mnore favourable than one alone to our hopes of completing, the scientific synthesis of known phenomena. The vast variety of phenomiena and their laws would sooner reach their explanation, if they really reached it by arrivinc at several causes, than if these had again to be referred to a single cause. But this consideration is, of course, a mere preliminary. The phenomena of the unknown regioln are to be judg,ed, not so muell by locrical needs and iintellectual processes, as by the moral nature of man. Final causes, desires, purposes, volitions, which are all phenomena of personal consciousness and subject to the moral law, are the considerations of decisive importance in framing, our coinceptions of the unknown region, anld niot scientific con- ceptionis of causality alone. The cate(rory of causality is in- eluded under and dominated by those of finality and personality; and these are the categories which give its final complexion to the unknown, as indeed they do also mediately to the known region. M. Renouvier insists very strong,ly and very riglhtly, in my opiniion, on tlhe necessity of employing the moral or practical, not oinly the speculative, reasoni in aseertainingi, the nature of tlhe Divinity. In the Psychologie, where all these questions are treated at leng,th, he represents God as the God of the moral reason, and rejects every attempt to ascertain his nature by identifying, him with the " law of laws or the aggregate of laws which compose the unliverse". Such a method could lead only to a " certain totality of unknowable functions," a conception belonging either to a materialistic or a pantheistic or a scholastic atheism. But " to attach oneself, by belief, to the existence of an order of Benevolence (Bonte) which saves the person and</page><page sequence="29">A3 Renouvier's Phlilosophy. - Logic. 59 assures the victory of the Just, this is to affirin God, without knowing anything else about hiim." (Psych. III. 191-193.) Such being what I must consider the just an(d profound views of M. iRenouvier on the nature of the Divine, andcl of our mneans of ascertainiing, it, what are tlhe considerationis whichl leal him to give the preference to a conception of it as composed of a numnber of Gods ? AgYain I nmust lhave recouirse to the Psycho- logie, where all the questions of this series are expressly treated, the foundation only being laid in the Logiqate. I bring forward the question here, because it can only be handled properly in. connexion with the Infinite; but in M. Renouvier's treatmient it is closely connected with the two otlhers of the same series, liberty and immortality; and his doctrine on these two enters largely as a determinative into that of polytlheism. His train of thoughlt is this. God, we know, is a limited Being; for, in the first place, he muist be construed to thought under the categories; secondly, his power and his knowledge are both lilmited by human freedom of tlhoug?,ht and action. (Psych. IlI. 251, 252.) This is one set of conisiderations. But, in the next place, this relative independence of othier persons, in regard to God, involves of itself their probable immortality. God " will dispose of the causes and ends of our world so far as the liberty and individuality of person-s, who are not lhe, and the general laws wlhieh he represents as envelopingt his own existence, allow it". (lb) These other persons, in short, treat the Diviniity as Hamlet treats the Ghost: "And for my soul, what can it do to that, Beilng a thiing imnmortal as itself?" Now, not to mention the probability of other celestial persons in the unknowln region, "our speculations in moral belief, by leadingt U,s to the thesis of the immortality of persons, have beforehand and necessarily opened to us the way to polytheismll, by means of apotheoses. The progress of life an-id virtue peoples the universe with divine persons, and we slhall be faitlhful to an ancient and spontaneous relig,ious sentiment if we call those among them Gods, whose nature we tlhink we can honiour and whose works we can bless." (lb. 254.) Besicles whichl, a hierarchy of Gods is in greater accordance with republican, monotheism with monarchical, sympatlhies; tlhougyh this is not put forth as a reason for belief, but only as a recollmmendation of it, if it should be accepted on other grounds. (lb. 2 59 ff.) These views are farther coinfirmed, wlhen we come to examine them in the liglht of history critically treated, as may be seen by turninc to the Fourth Essay, pp. 761 to 768. At the samiie tinme it is only fair to say, that M. lRenouvier must not be regarded as</page><page sequence="30">GO0 JT. Renouvier's Philokophy.-Log. doing- more than saying what can be said for polytheism, and that he expressly guards himself against being supposed to be making a personal confession of faith (Psych. III. 268). Still it is clear that- his sympathies lie in that direction. As far as sympathy goes, I think, we shall find the determining circuin- stance to be this,-do we lay most stress on the belief in God, or on the belief in Immortality? " Immortality," says M. Renouvier," is the grand moral faith of this doctrine," namely, of polytheism. (lb. 262.) There-is the real watershed between Monotheism and Polytheism, when both are taken alike as consequences of the moral law. But sympathy alone need not, as most certainly it ought not, be made the criterion of ques- tions like these. Let us go back to the intellectual root of the whole question. M. Renouvier requires to have. the Divinity construed to the logical intellect- before he will consent -to believe in it. His intellectual conception and his moral affirmation must, strictly coincide. God must be thought under the categories. The categories, as the be all and end all of consciousness, are at the root of the polytheistic conception. For, since they compel us, in any case,-to conceive the Divinity as finite, the hypothesis of several finite Divinities, like that of several finite causes, satisfies the imagination at less cost of thought than the hypothesis of one only. The very same requirement of having the Divinity construed to the logical intellect, before consenting to believe in it, is the ground of the Scholastic unifying conception of God; only that here infinity is thought to be embraced, a realised itnfinty, which, as M. Renouvier says, is a contradiction. One side denies the infinite, the other defines it. But the infinite can neither be denied nor defined. It is a fact which must nevertheless be reckoned with., It disposes of theorists, not they of it. The infinite, I have already tried to show, is a fact of perception, and not a fact of thought. It can only be partially conceived, by entering on a processus in infinitum, and conceiving one ideal beyond another in succession, the last of which still has infinity, undefined, beyond it, of which it falls infinitely short. There is an indefinite approximation to the infinite, and each stage of this approximation, in matters of religious belief, is an intellectual conception taking in so much and no more of the Infinite Being. Now what I say is this, that the moral affirmation of the existence of the Divinity attaches to the Infinite, the intellectual conception to the Ideals carved out of it successively in the indefinite approximation. The highest ideal conception which we can form is thus an imperfect imagae of the infinite, the nature</page><page sequence="31">Al. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Logic. 61 of which we can know in no other way than by successive more and more perfect ideals, or partial conceptions of it. The existence of the infinite is-a fact shown by analysis; no belief in the strict sense is possible of this, but only kniowledge; but the moral affirmation, that the infinite, in matter of religion, is represented (though imperfectly) by, and exists including, our highest ideal conception,-this is an act of religious belief, an act of faith. It affirms the existence of something not only not forced upon it, but of something which, (not being like the infinite alone an abstract element, but a concrete object), yet cannot be logically conceived as or for itself, but only in its- representative approximation. I accept as fully and as frankly as M. IRenouvier the necessary anthropomorphism of all religion. " All theism, in the eyes of a man of sincerity, is entirely anthropomorphic." (Phil. de" l'Hist., p. 767.) But I hold that the only possible escape from the narrowness of anthropomorphism, fromn the false sense of WraVTO weTpov av9pwro,o to the true one, lies in the fact, which analysis reveals, that the infinite both exists and escapes logical definition. This fact it is which keeps the universe from being dwarfed to the measure of human powers, as the categories dwarf it when they are taken as the measure of existence. But does this alone prove either monotheism or polytheism to be true ? Certainly not. But it leaves the field open for monotheism, which the narrower conception of a world limited by the categories would close. It leaves scope for the moral motives, which tend to unification, to operate. And this being so, then, to my mind, one consideration is of decisive weight. It is this. If the Divinity is to be conceived, as M. Renouvier contends in a passage already quoted, as the God of the moral- and practical reason, that is, as the God of all men's consciences; and if the conscience of men is formed everywhere on the same model, namely, on the ideal of Justice fulfilled by Benevolence, which is also M. Renouvier's doctrine; it follows that every one, so far as he approximates to his own ideal, approximates to the ideal of all. The ideal is the same, though approached by divers paths, and in different degrees. That which we represent to ourselves as the union of justice and benevolence, the infinite object of that approximative ideal, that and that only is the adequate object of religion. SHADWORTH H.
