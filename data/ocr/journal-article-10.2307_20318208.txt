<plain_text><page sequence="1">Notes on Books Lord RAGLAN is well known as an unsparing critic of accepted tenets, and this characteristic is displayed in his latest anthropological study (Watts and Co., Is. 3d.). Under the title of Joca-sta's Crimire (which was by the way an unwitting crime) he starts out to interpret the Oedipus complex and to solve the riddle of the Sphinx, which at the end he claims to have done. This, however, reminds us of Robert Brown ing's claim in the opening and closing lines of Sordello, since in neither case does the body of the work appear to satisfy it. For, truLth to tell, Lord Raglan is better as a destructive than as a constructive critic. The origin of the exogamy is in our opinion a problem still unsolved. We should be sorry, how ever, if our failure to be convinced as to his main thesis should deter readers from enjoying the many interesting features of this little book. The author has the advantage of knowing something of primitive peoples at first hand, and therefore does not indulge in the armchair speculations as to the habits and beliefs of the noble or ignoble savage which mar some psychological studies. He is particularly interesting on the subject of myth; with Jane Harrison he believes that rnyth arose out of ritual, and ritual out of reliance on the power of magic. In other words, anthropomorphism is not a primitive but a later tendency. In his fascinating study of Four Stages of Greek Religiotn Gilbert Murray clearly brings out the im personal nature of the first stage, before Olympus was tenanted by airy imaginings. It was the great merit of the Greeks that by their myths they humanized and debrutalized so many fears with their accompanying cruelties. Yet man has always been prone to torture himself and his fellows; in the primitive stage he walked in fear and trembling, hedged in between totem and taboo, ready to strike when he could not under stand. But before we condemn the myths of our remote ancestors and their human sacrifices, let us reflect how in these latter days holocausts are being offered up to support the myth of the deified State. When Dr. R. W. FAIRBROTHER's Textbook of Medical Bacteriology first appeared in 1937 we commended it as a clear and orthodox presentation of its subject, in form and size well suited to the needs of medical students. It has been a pronounced success, and the third edition, in which the word "'Medical" is omitted from the title, retains the chief merits of its predecessors, but might well have been more -extensively revised, despite the short time which has elapsed since previous editions. Although a new paragraph has been introduced on chemotherapy in pneumonia, there is no nen tion of the effect of sulphonamide compounds on either anthrax or gas gangrene. This is surprising, for not only has the chemotherapy of anaerobic wouind infections been much studied and debated since the war began, but the original observations on this subject, both experimental and clinical, were made no less than three years ago. The coagu lase test does not receive its due as the one certain criterion of pathogenicity in staphylococci, and Erikson's work on the differentiation of human and bovine strains of Actinomyces is disregarded. The statement on page 190 that "the antibody molecule of rabbit serum is less than that of horse serum" takes a form which will puzzle the student, and if he is any thing of a botanist he will applaud the inverted commas which enclose the strange word "hypomycete" on page 314. We venture to point out these among other minor defects in the hope that this otherwise excellent work may maintain its original high standard in the fLututre. The publishers are William Heinemann (Medical Books), Ltd., and the price is 17s. 6d.</page></plain_text>
