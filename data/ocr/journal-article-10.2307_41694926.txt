<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MARUTS By Uma Chakravarty The Rgveda dedicates thirty-five hymns to the Maruts.1 Besides these thirty-five hymns they are also invoked along with Agni, Indra, Visflu and Nirirti in a few stray verses and are also invoked along with many other deities in the hymns to the Višve DevSh. The two major aspects of the Rgvedic Maruts' character are, firstly, they are storm-gods and then they are Indra's associates and friends, so warriors. Etymology of the word 'marut' Nothing has yet been decisively said on the etymology of the word marut * The majority of scholars think that marut has been formed from mr " to shine 99 , whereas others think it is from mr " to die ". According to Yãska3 marut comes either from mi + rue " to shine " or from mahad + dru , " to run fast ". To him the Maruts were atmospheric storm-gods. Otto Böhtlingk and Rudolf Roth prefer to interpret mr in the word marut as " to shine " rather than as " to die ", keeping in mind the brilliant description of this group of gods as portrayed in the #F.4 Hopkins also indicates that marut has been formed from mr " to shine " when he says, " their name means the shining ones ".5 Monier Williams interprets marut from mr " to shine 99 and in that connection refers to the word mar l ci* According to Macdonell7 and i The Marut-hymns of the $V : I. 37-39 ; 64 ; 85-88 : 165 ; 167 ; 168 ; 171-172 ; II. 34 ; V. 52-61 ; VI. 66 ; VII. 56-59 ; VIII. 7 ; 20 ; 94 ; X. 73 (?) 77 ; 78. 2 Cf.

Kuhn, Von Schroeder, R. N. Dandekar and Sukumari Bhattacharji the Maruts were the " souls of the dead " and marut has been formed from mr " to die ".9 Inspite of the fact that in places the R.gvedic Maruts have been portrayed fearful, destructive, because of their being storm-gods, the over-all picture of these gods in the # V is very bright and brilliant and this prompts us to hold that mr in marut means " to shine ". Storm- Rain-gods The Maruts are born of the bright lightning ( 1. 23. 12 ).10 The Rudriyas shower rains even in windless deserts ( I. 38. 7 ). As the mother cow making sound nourishes its calf so the lightning nourishes the Maruts while they shower rains ( I. 38. 8 ). They darken the day with clouds which are laden with water and drench the earth with showers of rains ( I. 38. 9 ). They, on their onward march, make the stable unstable and the heavy, light ( I. 39. 3 ). They do harm to the harmful, shake and saturate the earth with water which they collect from heaven ( 1. 64. 5 ). Like wild elephants they devastate forests ( I. 64. 7 ). They roar like lions ( I. 64. 8 ). The irresistible Maruts shake the mountains, uproot trees and separate the branches from them ( I. 39. 5 ; 85. 4 ). They yoke Pfsatls ( their animals ) in their chariot and as soon as the tawny coloured animals draw them in their chariot the whole earth and man- kind are frightened ( I. 85. 4 ). Hearing the howling of the Maruts the earthly houses with their residents shake ( I. 38. 10 ). The following verse gives a vivid description of the youthful, invincible Maruts : ytiväno rudrs ajárã abhogháno vavakçúr ádhrigavah párvatã iva / drdha cid víšva bhuvanãni partitiva prá cyãvayanti divyani majmánã // 1. 64. 3. ö Keith, A. B. : The Mythology of All Races , Vol. VI, Boston, pp. 39-40. " There can be little doubt that the Maruts are the storm-gods, - wind in the qualified sense ". 9 « A. Kuhn, Benfey held the Maruts to be personifications of the souls of the dead and with this view Meyer and Von Schroeder substantially agree quoted from Macdo- nell's book ( op . с it. p. 81 ). Bhattacharji, Sukumari ; ( 1968 ) " Rudra, the Rudras and the Maruts ", Anvlksã Vol. Ill, Part I, p. 52. " The derivation of the word Marut is not clear but it appears to have been formed from verb mr - to die ( a parallel Greek verb maraino = to die) of which Märtanga is a cognate ". 10 All references are from the #V.</page><page sequence="3">ChakràVarty : The Maruts 613 " The youthful, ferocious, ever-fresh ( Maruts ), destroyers of their non-worshippers, intent on fulfilling the prayer of their devotees, with the steadiness of a mountain shake with their strength the whole of existence - heavenly and earthly. "H They are invoked to come in their bright, all-per- vasive chariot, decorated with lightning and armed with weapons. One sees " in the all-pervasive chariot of the Maruts " nothing but the clouds full of water and twinkling with lightning. The showers, as bright as honey, are welcomed by the people ( I. 87. 2 also I. 85. 2 ; V. 54. 2). 13 As the fire is uncontrollable so also is the sound of the Maruts ( I. 143. 5 ). As they per- vade the atmospheric regions, as their horses run as if being self-drawn, then indeed the universe with its buildings etc. is frightened ; wonderful indeed is their march ! As they move on resounding the mountains with their bow- lings and shaking the surface of heaven, the big trees are threatened and the creepers move from one place to the other ( 1. 166. 4 ; 5 ). The strong Maruts, as bright as fire and as fearful as the beasts of prey, pervade the regions with torrential rains and send the clouds helter-skelter ( II. 34. 1 ). They make the clean water of river Parusnî unclean and shatter the clouds ( adri ) with the felly of their chariot ( V. 52. 9; also see V. 53. 6 ; 7 ). The waters showered by the Maruts possess medicinal value, so, quite naturally, the devotees desire their company ( V. 53. 14 ). All devastations caused by the Maruts are only apparently ominous ; actually they are blessings to their worshippers ( V. 57. 3 ). They wash away the islands that are formed on the river-surface dur- ing the dry season ( Vili. 20. 4). During their fearful march the waters flow, the earth shakes but she does not become slim ( X. 77. 4 ).n Warrior-gods The verses depicting the Maruts as warrior-gods bear a totally different note from the verses portraying them as nature gods. They seem to repre- sent two sides of the same coin. They are invoked to kill Vjrtra along with Indra.14 The bright Maruts are born along with their weapons, with their Pjsati animals ; their shouts signal the death of their enemies. With whips in their hands as they proceed making horrifying sound then they adorn their path as it were (I. 37. 2 ; 3 ). Their steady weapons never fail them in the battle-fields ( 1. 39. 2 ). The leaders whose joy lies in the drink of soma, carry immensely strong weapons in their hands ( I. 64. 10 ). All the warriors 11 Tr. by author. 18 We prerume, such descriptions indicate that the Aryans started by depending on rain waters for their agriculture.

Amrtamahotsava Volume are frightened as these bright warriors resembling powerful kings, are enga- ged in frightful battles ( I. 85. 8 ). They are implored to protect their devo- tees from deceitful enemies ( II. 34. 9 ). While fighting against the enemies they at the same time create more powerful weapons as it were (V. 52. 6).15 Guarded by shoulder-bands and yoking the spotted antelopes ( horses ? ) as they march forward, they win all battles ( V. 55. 6 ). The verse under V. 57. 2 gives a complete picture of the Maruts as fighters - the sons of Pjrsni carry- ing all kinds of weapons set on their auspicious march in chariots drawn by strong horses.1' Through the Maruts' help alone powerful warriors defeat their enemies in the battle-field ( VII. 56. 23 ). No other warrior ever looked so bright as do the Maruts in their armour and weapons ( VII. 57. 3 ). The worshippers of the Maruts are never harmed in the battle-field ( VII. 59. 4 ). They are ferocious, showerers ( of fulfilment of desires ) and strong-armed ; they are not scared of their personal security. Their beautiful chariot is fur- nished with steady weapons like bows etc. Their victory in the fore-front of the battle-field is always guaranteed (VIII. 20. 12). Anthropomorphic features The Maruts adorn their body with bright golden ornaments. The golden necklaces dangling on their chests endow them with a very bright look. They put on golden bracelets on their arms and anklets on their ankles. Dazzling golden headdresses embellish their heads. As a woman decorates her limbs with beautiful ornaments so do the Maruts. They wear a very bri- ght look as they proceed on their equally bright cahriots. They carry wea- pons on their beautifully ornamented shoulders and arms. They also carry a whip in their hands. When they make very loud sound with their whips the listener, though actually hearing it from a long distance, feels that it has been made on the selfsame spot. The mother-cow ( Pfsni ) dresses up her calves and makes them look very attractive. The blissful sons of Rudra set out on their onward march in their chariot. The source of their energy lies in their weapons which they carry on their shoulders. Like a bride- groom, brightly ornamented, the Maruts proceed on their chariots. They 14 В V : I. 23. 9. ; hatd vrtrátii sudanava ìndrena sáhasa yuja / J5 This indicates intensity of fighttog. 16 The text goes as follows : v as tm ant a rstimánta manìsinah sudhánvana ísumanto nisahgínah / svásvfth stha suráthüh prsnimãtarah svãyudhú m ar uto yftthanã súbhatn Ц</page><page sequence="5">Chakravarty : The Maruts 613 are all of equal age and form. Their young father Rudra and resourceful mother Pfsni have made their days all blissful.1* Though the Maruts have been endowed with anthropomorphic features yet one can perceive that at the base of all such descriptions lies the reality of nature in the form of storm, rains and wind. Geldner observes with refer- ence to this, " Trotz aller anthropomorphischen Umbildung schwebt doch gerade bei den Marut das natürliche Phänomen der urplötzlich aus der her- vorbrechenden Gewittersturms den Dichter immerwieder vor ".ld ' Inspite of all anthropomorphic modifications the Maruts are, however, always present in the poet's mind as natural phenomenon representing thunder storm that suddenly breaks through cloud. '19 The bright Maruts The Rgvedic Maruts are all through described as dazzling with bright- ness. " They are as bright as sunshine."20 " The greatness of the Martus who are as bright as the sun, is worthy of eulogy. "-1 " They who are wonderful and sun-coloured are marching upwards. The following epithets speak of their bright appearance, tvesadyumnah ( I. 37. 4 ), tvesah (I. 38. 7 ; 15 ), bhrãjadrstayah ( I. 64. 1 1 ; V. 55. 1 ; X. 78. 7 ), citrabhãnavah ( I. 85. 11), rukmavaksasah ( II. 34. 2 ; 8 ; V. 55. 1 ; 57. 5 ; VIII. 20. 22 ; X. 78. 2 ), hiranyašiprah ( II. 34. 3 ) and süryatvacah ( VII. 59. 11). The howling Maruts The howling nature of the Maruts indicates primarily their identity as storm-gods and secondarily as war-gods. The god Agni who makes sound is comparable to the Maruts only.'2J The mountains, though great and old, and the heavenly regions tremble at the sound made by the Maruts ( V. 60. 3 ) . The wonderful and bright Maruts shake the heavens during their onward march which is always accompanied by sound.24 17 The following Rgvedic verses depict the anthropomorphic features of the Maruts : I. 37. 3 ; 64. 4;' 85. 1 ; 3; 88. 2; 3; 5; 166. 10; 168. 3; II. 34. 3 ; 13; V. 53. 4; 54. 11; 55. 1 ; 56. 1 ; 57. 6 ; 58. 2 ; VII. 56. 13 ; 57. 3 ; VIII. 7. 25 ; 32 ; 20. 11. 18 Geldner, К.

Often they were besought by their devotees to shake off their anger against them. They are approached with obeisance and prayer so that they may shake off their anger, release the horses from the chariot, come to the sacrifice and accept the oblations offered to them (I. 171.1). They are described as terri- fic ( bhimasamdršah -V. 56.2). " As to err is human so may the Maruts withdraw their weapons raised against their devotees, for, they long for their favour and not for their enmity " ( VII. 57. 4 ).25 Sometimes they are approa- ched for their favour through other gods. I. 94 is an Agni-hymn. In its twelfth verse Mitra and Varuna are prayed to by the Maruts' worshippers, so that the great anger of the Maruts against them be pacified and they may be highly pleased with them. The fearful Maruts All regions, the whole universe and the well-built houses ( harmyãni ) on earth shake in great fear as the Maruts march on. They are earnestly implored to throw far away their weapons and be auspicious to their devotees (I. 172. 2). The helpless sage Vašistha tries to convince his own self by say- ing that the Maruts, inspite of their destructive activities, would not inflict any harm upon him and his people ( VII. 56. 9 ). Sacrifices are offered to Maruts whose advent can be known from a long distance. As they march they cause tremors in the earth which at that time resembles nothing but a frail boat full to its brim ( with passengers ).26 Every creature is afraid of the high-minded Maruts who are born of brightness and are very strong and dreadful (VII. 58.2). The fearful Maruts are nothing but storms in origin. The storm brings forth life through devastation. The Maruts also stand for the well-being of their worshippers. The epithets dhrsnu ( I. 37. 4 ), rišada - sah ( I. 39. 4 ), udbhidah ( V. 59. 6 ), ghoravarpasah ( I. 64. 2 ), ugrãh ( 1. 166. 6) speak of the Maruts' fearful nature.

They are of equal age, equal mind and hail from the 'same place.27 They are simultane- ai Such descriptions remind us of Rudra, the Maruts* father. 26 RV V. 59. 2. âmãd gsãm bhiydçã bh^mir ejati náur na pUrna ksarati vyáthiryati / duredrso ye citáyante étnabhir antár tnahé viddthe yetire tiárah // 27 Rv I. 165. lab kãyã subhÚ sávayasah sántlüh / s am any a marútah sám mimiksuh If</page><page sequence="7">Chakravarty : The Maruts 617 ously born and simultaneously they send showers ( V. 55. 3 ). Like the spokes of a wheel, neither of them is inferior while none is superior either ( V. 58. 5ab ). Neither of them is the eldest nor the youngest, nor is any the middle one. Such a phenomenon of equality in all aspects indicates their identity as storm-gods ; the storms are all alike eternally and universally ; this also indicates their identity as soldiers, for, the soldiers look alike in their uniforms. The following epithets bear relevance in this connection : sap sara - sah ( I. 168. 9 ), yama iva ( V. 57. 4 ), sanílãh ( VII. 56. 1 ), sabandhavah (VIII. 20. 1 ), samanyavah ( II. 34. 3 ; 5 ; 6 ; VIII. 20. 1 ).*&gt; The Maruts as birds The Maruts are several times compared with birds. They who are of one mind are invited to the so/tia-libation like a flock of swans ( II. 34. 5 ). Like a flock of birds they fall from heaven ( V. 59. 7 ). Like falcons the Maruts come to the oblations offered to them ( I. 165. 2 ; VII. 56. 3 ; VIII. 20. 10 ).'?0 Stormy clouds flying at high speed lie at the base of such poetic imagination.31 The epithet nïlaprsthâh ( VII. 59. 7) for the Maruts, is very appropriate in this connection. The Maruts and Soma-libation In sacrifices the Maruts are offered with the usual soma- libation, some- times independently, sometimes with %Agni and other gods and mostly with 28 Ibid, 59. 6ab : té ajyestha ákanisthãsa udbhido tnadhyamãso mãhasã vi vãvrdhuh / Also see Rv. V. 60. 5. 29 samanyavah appears to be a pet expression with Grtsamada in connection with the Maruts. He uses the same thrice in one hymn ( II. 34. 3 ; 5 : 6 ). 30 Prof. R. N. Dandekar thinks that because the Maruts were souls of the dead so they have been described as birds : " But perhaps the most suggestive point in this context is that the Maruts are often represented as birds. It may be recalled that according to the primitive mythological thought the spirits of the dead often wander about in the forms of birds." Vedtc Mythological Tracts, 1979, p. 237 ( first published in 1953 ). We would like to observe here that, not only the Maruts but some other gods also have been compared with birds.

The Maruts were born along with the Pj-satïs ( I 7. 2 ). 3 When the Maruts yoke the tawny coloured horses to their chariots, the earth with all its inhabitants is frightened ( I. 39. 6 ) ; As they, drawn by the Prsatls, travel, they shower rains.0'5 The epithet prsadašvasah is often used for the Maruts.:{ ! The ques- tion arises, who these Prsatïs are. The Nigha.jtu says, prsatyo marutam ( I. 15. 6 ). Sãyana while commenting on the word in I. 37. 2 says viddyutyuktä mrgyah . Geldner translates the word as schekeJ 7 Sãyana and Geldner hint at their identity as natural phenomenon. Clouds, being tinged with lightning are the animals of the storm-god Maruts, appears to be a very rational imagery. Horses also in places are stated as the Maruts' animals. 5" The parents of the Maruts The Maruts' mother is Pjrsni and they are called pršnimatarah .;i9 Pfšni bore them in her womb (VI. 66. 3 ; VII. 56. 4 ). She gave birth to the resplendent Maruts ( I. 168. 9 ). Go also is mentioned as their mother ( I. 85. 3 ; VIII. 94. 1 ). Rudra is their father. They are called rudrah , 0 rudriyahn аз Also see Rv I. 23. 7; 10; 88. 3; 101. 9; II. 34. 6; VII. 59. 3; 6 ; VIII. 94. 3 ; 4; 9-12.

To us Práni is the cloud laden with water and so quite naturally the Maruts, the storm-gods, are her children. ( Cf. Keith, op. cit . p. 53 : " Pyšni is the mother of the Maruts, perhaps the spotted storm« clouds " ). On one occasion the Maruts have been stated to be the sons of Bharata ( II. 36. 2 ) and on another as the children of Aditi and heaven (X. 77.2). Rodasi, the female associate of the Maruts Like Stíryã the Asvins' chariot, Rodasi, the symbol of brightness ( tve - sapratíkã ) and the leader of the sky, ascends the chariot of the Maruts for enjoyment and the Maruts place the young lady in their car ( see I. 167. 5; 6 ). The sacrificer invokes the chariot of the Maruts in which the noble and bliss- ful Rodasi has taken her seat ( cf. V. 56. 8-9 ). Griswold holds that Rodasi is " perhaps a personification of the light- ning, since she is described as « self-luminous ' ",47 We also maintain that 42 Ibid.

Geldner is more logical ; MahS- deva got his place in the Hindu pantheon much later. 46 II. 34. 2cd : rudró yád vo maruto rukmavaksasah vrsãjani prsnyah sukrá udhani Ц 46 Prof. R. N. Dandekar shows four stages of the mythology of the Maruts. According to him, in the first stage the Maruts " have been independent divinities and were regarded as the hosts of spirits of the dead. ( 2 ) The Maruts were later associated with Rudra after the latter god was included in the Vedic pantheon mainly as the god of death." In the third and the fourth stages the Maruts were associated with Indra ( op. cit. p. 238 ). We would like to observe with reference to the first stage of the Marut-mythology, as classified by Prof. Dandekar, that, the Rgvedic texts do not give any evidence in favour of the fact that the Maruts were souls of the dead. And, regarding the second stage, it is true that they were very much associated with Rudra but that was only in name ; they had no common platform of activities with Rudra as they had with Indra. We think that, in those days life, in all aspects was quite helpless and insecure be- cause of the total absence of any security measures to fight against tumultuous destru- ctive nature. People often became victims of cruel nature. This destructive aspect of nature got a form in the imgination of the fearful god Rudra. The Maruts, the storm- gods, were also apparently destructive and so a relation was drawn between them and Rudra. But, as storm-gods they had a positive function to perform : as they travelled in their chariot they made the earth pregnant as a man his wife ( cf V. 87. 7 ). 47 Griswold, H. D. : ( 1st.

They are indrajyesthah ( I. 23. 8 ), indravantah ( V. 57. 1 ). Indra on his part is marutstotra ( I. 101. 11 ), marudvrdhah ( III. 13. 6 ), marutta ( I. 101. 8 ) and marutvat ,49 Of all these epithets of Indra, marutvat occurs most frequently. Indrãní introduces herself as marut sakhã .51 In the AV51 also Indra is marutvat . The Maruts earned the right to the .sowa-libation, they got a place in the soma- sacrifice after their association with Indra ( I. 87. 5 ). Whatever favour the Maruts show to their devotees, Indra never contradicts that. All the gods out of Vftra's fear left Indra, only the Maruts were by his side ;5- this story is referr- ed to in the Ait . Br . also. As a result the Maruts enjoyed the mid-day so/wû-pressing along with Indra ; the Marutvatiya graha and the Marutva - tiya pragãtha were introduced in favour of the Maruts ( see Ait. Br. III. 20 ). Their status in the Vedic pantheon was high. A note of serious discord bet- ween the Maruts and Indra is recorded in the Rgvedic hymns from I. 165- 171. The Maruts were being charged by Indra of leaving him alone at the time of killing^Ahi ( ahihatya I. 165. 6). The Maruts, however, retorted by saying that, all the achievements of Indra's life had been possible only because they were by his side and they have the capacity to perform much more. Indra was not subdued and was about to kill his brothers, the Maruts ( I. i70. 2 ). Through sage Agastya's mediation the dispute was somehow put down. Happily did Indra say, achanta me chadayãthã ca nünam , "you have pleased me before and you please me now " ( I. 165. 12 ). Agastya, later discloses the truth to the Maruts that he prepared the offering for them but Indra had 48 According to Sãyana -bhãsya (I. 167. 5 ) Rodasi was the wife of the Maruts.

Out of fear of Indra he concealed the same elsewhere (I. 171. 4).5j The same charge against the Maruts by Indra has been referred to in Vin. 7. 31 also. Based on the hymns to the Maruts the relation between Indra and the Maruts has been discussed so far. We would like to have a glance at the same, as it has been reflected in the relevant Indra-hymns. Indra did not know what point of Vftra's body he should strike at, in order to kill him. The Maruts passed to him the important information and Vrtra was killed ( III. 32. 4 ). India's Vftra-killing was felicitated by the songs sung by the Maruts. On that occasion Püsan and Visnu cooked a hundred buffaloes for the Vrtra-killer and three lakes of soma wers prepared for him ( VII. 17. 11 ). The Maruts being requested sang songs in praise of Tndra and then alone was it possible for the Vftrahã to kill with his hundred-edged vajra his invin- cible enemy ( VIH. 89. 1; 3 ). The Maruts also sang in praise of Indra when he shattered the ninety-nine castles ( of Šambara ) ( V. 29. 6). Inspite of the manifold anthropomorphic description of the Maruts, in the Family Books ( sp. Book V ) they are basically nature gods represent- ing storm, wind and rains. To be precise, they are nature anthropomorphic sed. How and following what evolutionary process they became Indra's friends and associates is difficult to say. In the onward march of the storm lies a sort of uniformity, a kind of discipline. This characteristic is quite patently present in marching soldiers. These common elements might have been the grounds for the transformation of basically storm-gods into warrior gods as has already been thought by Prof. Dandekar. He observes, " The Maruts are like brothers among whom none is the eldest or the youngest ( V. 95. 6 ; 60. 5 ). They are equal in age (I. 165. 1 ) and are of one mind ( VIII. 20. 1 ; 21 ) These peculiarities of the Maruts must have presented to the mind of the Vedic poet the picture of ths formation of well-disciplined sol- diers in their uniforms. When; therefore, the memories of the original chara- cter of the Maruts were being gradually dimmed, the Vedic poets naturally thought of associating them newly with their war-god, Indra."61 03 A conflict between the Indra-cult and the Marut-cult, the upholder of which is sage Agastya, is rtilectcd in this conflict between Indra and the Maruts. 54 op. cit. p. 193. Prof. Dandekar has shown four stages of the mythology of the Maruts. Here we are concerned with the third and the fourth stages. He thinks, because of their discipli- ned formation the Maruts were associated with Indra. And, in the last stage, when Indra came to be looked upon as a rain-god, the Maruts became storm-gods ( op . cit. p€ 230 ). ( Continued on the next page» J</page><page sequence="12">622 ABO RI i Amrtamahotsava Volume The Maruts and Agni, Visnu, Varuna, Väyu, Nirrti etc. But for Indra the Maruts' relation with other gods is rather formal. I. 19 is jointly dedicated to Agni and the Maruts. Throughout the whole hymn the refrain is : marúdbhir agna a gahi. V. 60. 8 invokes Agni and the Maruts together to the .sowa-libation ( also see I. 31. 1 ; VIII. 7. 32). Visnu and the Maruts, his associates, are mentioned together in V. 87. 1. Both Varuna and the Maruts are paid homage together in VÍIT. 41. 1 (a Varuna- hymn ). Vãyu generated the Maruts from the udders of heaven ( I. 134. 4). The singer prays to the Maruts, ' let not Nirrti kill them ' ( I. 38. 6 ). VII. 58. 1 states that the Maruts pervade the heavenly regions from regions of Nirrti.53 Does it hint at their identity as mortals i. e. from mortality they raised themselves to immortality ? Apart from these deities the Maruts are also invoked along with Indra-Vãyu, Brhaspati, Mitrãgni, Püsan, Bhaga, Ädityas, Rta, Brahmanaspati, Ašvins and Usas.5 ^ The Maruts had evidently a distinct place along with other divinities in the Vedic pantheon. The proteges of the Maruts The TIV refers to a number of the Maruts' protégés. Trita had been fighting with his enemies ; the invincible Maruts stood by his side and conse- quently Trita's enemies were defeated.57 The thirsty Gotama besought the Maruts for water. Softened by the sage's prayer they shifted near him a well from another place ( I. 85. 10; 11 ). The Maruts also contributed immensely towards the achievement of the status of a sage on the part Šyavašva (V. 61 ). Called by the sage Ušanas as the well-armed Maruts, brightly dressed with golden head-dresses etc.. proceeded towards him, even heaven cried out ( Continued from p. 621. ) Our findings tell us that the Maruts were earlier storm-gods and later evolved into warrior gods, Indra's associates. In the Family Hymns the Maruts were basically storm-gods but anthrpomorphised. Moreover, their relationship with Indra is depi- cted more in the Indra hymns, belonging to the first mandala, than in the hymns dedicated to the Maruts. The history of the Aryans tells us that Indra was originally a warrior god. When the Aryans, after fighting many battles with the non- Aryans, settled in India then they became an agricultural people and started depending on rains for a good harvest. At that time their necessity was more for a rain -god than for a warrior god. So, quite naturally, the most important warrior god Indra evolved into rain-god. б» Nirrti, in the whole of the В V, has been mentioned in connection with the Maruts twice ( I. 38. 6 ; VII. 58. 1 ) only. Basing on these two instances we find it difficult to draw the conclusion that the Maruts were originally associated with Nirrti as has been mentioned by Prof. Dandekar ( op. cit . p. 236 ). бе See BV I. 14. 3 (Indra-Vãyu, Brhaspati, Mitragni, Pusan, Bhaga, Ãdityas) ; 15. 2 ( Rtu ) ; 40. 1 ( Brahmanaspati ) ; 44. 14 ( Varuna, Asvins and Usas )ã Bf See RV II. 34. 10 ; VIII. 7. 24.</page><page sequence="13">Chakravaäty : The Maruts 623 in fear ( VIII. 7. 25; 26 ). They also gave protection to Turvasa, Yadu and Kan va (VIII. 7.1 8 ). They gave wealth consisting of horses to Bharata (V. 54. 19). Now the question arises, who was Bharata -a fore-father of áyã- vãsva he being the seer of the hymn ? The Maruts have been mentioned once ( II. 36. 2 ) as Bharata's children also.58 Maruts -the maryas The Maruts are often described as mar yah. They are rudrasya maryãh ( I. 6 *. 2 ; VII. 56. 1 ) - the sons of Rudra ; divo maryah (V. 59. 6 ) - the children of heaven. Sãyana interprets maryah as mãrakã manusyarûpâ vã ( see bhãsya of X. 77. 2). Geldner translates maryah as 44 yiingen."59 The nature of the Maruts as storm-gods, as soldiers, is strong and vigorous and so quite naturally maryãh became a very appropriate epithet for them.60 According to Stig Wikander, *mario= Skt. marya = Männerbund i. е. a band of young men. He is of the opinion that, a nong the different ethnic groups of the Aryans there was the custom of initiating groups of young men with observance of special rites. After this initiation which resembles death ( cf. Skt. dvija ) they were considered as reborn. The Maruts are the divine counterparts of such earthly Mánnerbund ,61 To us Wikander's opinion appears too far-fetched.(iJ Louis Renou also holds that the Maruts are a band of " young men " ( marya ).6 5 5S O. H. de. Wijesekara " Rgvedic Bharata ; A survival from Aryan Pre-history Univer- sity of Ceylon Review , vol. VII. 3. 1949, p. 160), observes in this regard, " An ana- lysis of Rudra's character in the Rv shows he is only the primitive hunter deified ( Cp. Pali ludda-ka for hunter) The Maruts are also such hunters ( mar-ut , originally killer )." He further thinks that the warriors are an evolution of primitive hunters. He also thinks, that the Bharatas were fighters from bhr to carry off, hence to rob, plunder, raid ; bhara = battle. So the Maruts who were originally hunters later became warriors, the assoiates of Indra. According to Wijesekara, the Maruts evolved from the Bharatas which, of course, tallies with RV II. 36,2. Since Aryan pre-history is still hypothetical, Wijesekara's opinion cannot be finally accepted. Moreover, the linguistic interpretation of the words rudra and mar ut , given by him, yet remains to be proved. 69 op. cit. p. 84. (i0 The Rgvedic poets had the tendency to use a particular epithet in connection with a particular deity. For example, dasra means * beautiful ' * charming ' in general, but the poets of the R V are fascinated with this epithet especially for the Asvins (Cf.

The following verse is very relevant in this connection : vratamvrãtam ganámganam sušastíbhir agnêr bhamam marútãm ôja ï mahe / ( ИТ. 26. 6ab ) Here vrata , gana or šardhas means a group in general and is quite different from the group of Rudras whose number is fixed at eleven, or the group of Vasus who are eight in all, or that of the Adityas who are always twelve. V. 52. 17, of course, mentions them as seven by seven : saptá me saptá sãkinah , then according to VIII. 96. 8 they are sixty-three : trih fastis tvã maruto vãvrdhãnah . But, they are mentioned forty-nine or sixty-three in the TlV once and for all. In the TS ( II. 2. 5 ) their number is fixed at forty-nine through a story which narrates that Indra, jealous of Vãyu who was in the state of a foetus in Aditi's womb, chopped the foetus into seven parts, and then each of these into seven again, thus making the total number forty-nine. In later Vedic literature seven are the different names of wind.64 In the RV the idea of the Maruts as group deities consisting of fixed number does not exist. They are many Maruts ( marutah ) i. e. plural of the stem marut. They are mentioned twice (VIII. 12.29; 13.28) as Indra's people ( višah ). The idea that the Maruts are Indra's people developed more in the TS and in the Brãhmanas. In the RV the Maruts, apart from being Indra's people, have a separate independent identity which they almost lost in Inter Vedic literature. The Maruts - euhemeristic Once the Maruts are addressed by the sage Kanva, " oh you the chil- dren of Pfšni ! had you been mortal and had I been immortal !

These instances speak of their euhe- meristic origin. Compared to the massive representation of them in the as nature gods these few references are, however, meagre. It has been observed by us that, the more the Maruts get closer to Indra the more they behave like human beings. In a few hymns of the first ( I. 165-71 ) and eighth ( 7, 12 ) marídalas they are represented in the main as Indra's associates, friends and also as rivals. They are depicted quite euhemeristically in those hymns. Such euhemeristic representation of the Maruts led some scholars to conclude that the Maruts were originally human beings. According to Sata- valekar the Maruts were human heroes, great patrons who having decorated themselves with ornaments served their mother-land and so quite naturally go, the mother earth, was their mother. According to him the word marut has been formed from mar " to die " - ye maranaparyantam utthãya yudhyante.ß 7 Nigam Sharma maintains that, as the Rubhus, originally human beings, by their dexterity raised themselves to the status of divinity, so also did the Maruts. They are successful young soldiers of Indra/8 Uma Gupta refers to the RV I. 72.2 and says, "the Maruts - « mortal bands ' with their spouses worshipped Agni for three autumns and thus though ' mortal bands ' won the holy names for worship and dignified their bodies. "ß9 Regarding the opinions of these scholars we would like to comment that, they have given a partial opinion on the identity of the Maruts and have totally neglected the primary aspect of their character which lies in storms, rains and winds, and which has been represented in the majority of hymns to the Maruts. That the Maruts were originally not human beings is also evi- dent from the fact that in the early Vedic age no conflict arose regarding the Maruts' right to the soma-WoMion ; they had been very naturally and with dignity enjoying this right whereas the Rbhus had to struggle hard in achiev- ing this right. Much contradiction arose regarding the Asvins* right to the soma- libation also.70 66 op» cit . p. 48, n. 4 ( tr. by author ).

Some magical elements are added in their character : " Let Indra confound the army ; let the Maruts slay with force ; let it go back conque- red " ( III. I. 6 The singer asks the Maruts to pierce the enemy with baffling darkness ( III. 2. 6 ). Pršni is their mother ( V. 21. 11), but their father is Pašupati ( V. 24. 12 ). They are also the children of height ( I. 26. 3 : pravato napãt ). The Maruts in the Taittiriya Samhitã, Brahmanes and in the Sutras Although the principal traits of the Maruts' character are apparently present in the TS and in the Brähmanas, yet there is no denying the fact that, compared to the Rgvedic Maruts, the Maruts of the later Vedic literature have lost their prominence and grandeur.

In these later Vedic literature they have been permanently placed in the position of deva - višah - divine subjects. It has been already observed that in the A V the Maruts have been transformed from storm-gods to rain- gods and the same trend has been main- tained in the TS also. The TS represents a society which was sacrifice- oriented. So, the Maruts have been referred to in connection with sacrifices only. The Kãríristi is performed for rains. The Maruts have a major part in rain- bringing. They are invoked in many verses in this sacrifice ( see TS II. 4. 7-10 ). As has been already referred to they are represented as seven winds in the Ait. Br . Our conjeture is. as they are wind-gods and rain-gods, so they are kridins ( TS I. 8. 4 ) i. e. playful in their manner. Some war-like elements in their character can also be traced in the TS. In the apratiratha hymn ( IV. 6. 4 ) they are desired to lead the divine soldiers with Indra as their leader. Their martial nature can be inferred from the expressions like marutãm prasave jesyãmi , marutãm ojase svãhã ( TS I. 8. 14; 15). The Maiuts are Indra's friends.8;î They are also indrajyesthâh ť with Indra as their head ' ( TS V. 5. 9 ). Indra killed Vftra but he was not sure whether he had really killed his enemy. The Maruts revealed the truth to Indra on condition that the first offering is to be given to them81. Besides these, the Maruts are invited along with Indra in the Kãmyesti sacrifice. In the §odašin sacrifice they are the participants in the mid-day sacrifice. Besi- des being enjoyers of soma , caru, ãmiksã ( clotted85 curd ), they are also given the seventh limb of the horse in the horse-sacrifice/6 The Maruts were about to devastate the sacrifice ; Prajãpati, somehow, pacified them by offer- ing animal-fat to them ( Tait .

But the TS associates them with this number invariably : " The Maruts with seven sylla- bles won the seven-footed šakvarísB ( I. 7. 1 1 ; I. 8. 2 ) ; the purodaša baked in seven potsherds is to be offered to them, they are seven in troops.83 The most significant development in the mythology of the Maruts which in the TS and the Brãhmanas is observed is that, they are now placed in the position of the subjects of the gods, i. e. devavi&amp;ah . " The Maruts are the subject class among the gods ; verily by subjects among the gods he wins for him the subjects among men " 0 ( TS II. 2. 25 ). " Vaisvãnara is kingly power, the Maruts the people ; having offered to Vaisvãnara, he offers those to the Maruts ; verily he attaches the people to the kingly power He utters aloud ( in the direction of the Agnidh ) for Vaisvãnara, he offers the offerings of the Maruts muttering ; therefore, the kingly power speaks above the people "9l ( TS V. 4. 7 ). From the above statements it becomes evident that the kingly power always had the threat93 from the subjects, and there was constant effort on the part of the royalty to subjugate people. Such elements were not present in the Rgvedic texts. In the later Samhitãs and early Brãhmana period monarchy had been gradually taking shape93 which the Rgvedic Aryans, who had been so busy in fighting against the non-Aryans and settling down in the new land, were not previously familiar with. The Maruts who were resplendent " martial storm-gods " ,94 Indra's associates and friends in the who were strong enough to challenge even Indra's strength, now lose their grandeur, their privileges which they had been enjoying as gods, and are placed in the position of the subjects of the gods. It is true that they had been enjoying ¿-orna-libation along with Indra, the reason, we presume, is, as they were Indra's people so they were royal people, i. e. belonging to the royal entourage, escorting the king to the sacri- fice ; so they must be shown due honour along with their master. They are now associated with sins also. The SB ( II. 5. 2. 7 ) states that the sacrificer's wife who has committed the sin of having intercourse with one who is not her 88 Tr. by Keith, A.

The Maruts are connected with the Ašvattha tree - " Ašvattha is the might of the Maruts " ( TS II. 3. 1 ). A review of the Šrautasutras tells us that the Maruts had been enjoying the same status in the sacrifices as they had been enjoying in the Samhitã- and the Brähmana- period. But in the Gjrhyasutras, to be more specific in the Paras - kara grhyasütra, they have fallen very low. While dealing with the Praustha - /wwfa-sacrifice this Grhyasütra states : Having cooked milk-rice for Indra and cakes, and having put cakes round (the fire), he sacrifices the two ãjya portions and ãjya oblations to Indra, to Indrânï, to Aja Ekapãd, to Ah¡ Budhnya and to the Prosthapadas. After he has eaten ( his portion of the sacrificial food ), he offers bali to the Maruts. For the Šruti says, c the Maruts eat what is not sacrificed ( This bali he offers ) in the Ašvattha leaves, because it is said, 4 The Maruts stood in the Ašvattha tree.' ,,J6 Here we wonder at the poor oblations offered to Indra. Gone is his so delicious pools of ¿o/wa-drink ! If Indra is offered with the milk-rice then keeping in conformity with the general trend in the fall of the standard of offering to the gods, it is quite justified that such a bali is offered to the Maruts, the Maruts who are the ahutadas .9 ' The rites prescribed in the Grhyasutras are performed by the house-holder without any priestly help in a very informal manner, bereft of the pomp of the ¿rawta-sacrifices, so it is quite natural that the oblations offered to the deities were also of quite an ordinary standard, without the grandeur of a šrauta sacrifice. Opinions of scholars on the identity of the Maruts So far, scholars have come up with eight different opinions07 on the identity of the Maruts. A majority of them, right from Yãska, hold that 95 Paraskara Grhyasutra II. 15. 2-4; tr. Oldenberg, H. ; SBE 29, p. 331 86 Paraskara GrhyasUtra has quoted ahutãdo vat marutah from ЬВ IV. 3.:2. 16 in support of the rule that the Maruts should be offered òa/t-offering. In the technical sense the term ah uta is applied to the òa/t-offering. Šankhayana GrhyasUtra (ed. Sehgal, S. R. : Delhi, 1960. I. 107) defines ahuta : ah uto balikarmanã. Prof. R. N. Dandekar identifies the Maruts originally with the souls of the dead. Their association with Ašvattha tree, their being ahutadas are some of the many grounds for such inference ( see op. cit . pp. 236-38 ). Chronologically the Sutras belong to the last phase of the Vedic period. Had the Maruts been originally the souls of the dead, then the references to the Ašvattha etc. were expected in the RV also, the В v being the earliest phase of the Vedic literature. e* The different opinions of scholars on the identity of the Maruts may be roughly summed up as follows ; I. Storm-gods : Heinrich Zimmer, Adolf Kaegi, E. W. Hopkins, H. Oldenberg, K. F. Geldner, A. A. Macdonell, A. B. Keith, M. Winternitz, J. Gonda.

He gives a description of the terrible Indian mon- soon, translates RVV. 83 and in that connection adds " Zweifelsohne hat man manche andere prächtige Schilderung des Gewitters des Zuges der Maruts auf den Südwest Monsun zu beziehen."08 According to Adolf Kaegi, " Rudra's sons and companions are richly adorned, well-armed Maruts, the gods of thunder-storm, the heavenly singers." 9 A. Barth maintains, " Indra's faithful companions, the Maruts, probably the bright ones, gods of storm, of the lightning...".100 Hopkins says about these deities, "They are red storm-gods, following Rudra, their father, and accompanying the storm- bringer Indra... . Their mother is the variegated cow Pfšni, the mother cloud. Their name means shining, gleaming ones... an unadulterated type of nature god. "101 Edmund Hardy holds discussion on the Maruts in the chapter entitled " Regen und Wind " which signifies his opinion on the the Maruts* identity.102 H. Oldenberg accepts the Maruts primarily as nature gods conne- cted with storm and wind " Die Beziehung der Maruts auf Sturm und Gewitter, insonderheit auf den Monsun, der alljährlich die grossen Regen bringt drängt sich auf.

Ml01 To A. B. Keith also the Maruts are, " the deities of wind in their aspect as bearing the storm clouds. "105 We have already referred to the view of K. F. Geldner, an upholder of the view that the Maruts were storm-gods. M. Winternitz also believed that the Maruts were storm-gods. 06 To Jan Gonda, the Maruts were, in the main, storm- gods and were also at the same time benevolent earthly bards and Indra's associates : " Vielleicht sollte man sie für atmosphärishe, besonders gewitte- rige Sturmmächte halten die nach Analogie irdischer Verhältnisse als Helfer, Barden, Heerenschaar Indras interpretiert wurden."107 We have already dis- cussed the view regarding the Maruts* identity of Stig Wikander, to whom the Maruts were the heavenly counterpart of an earthly band of young men and also of Louis Renou, to whom the Maruts were, " a band of young men." The euhemeristic view regarding the Maruts of O. H. de A. Wijese- kara, S. D. Satavalekar, Nigam Sharma and Uma Gupta has been already discussed. According to R. C. Hazra,108 the Maruts were originally followers of an anti-Tndra Iranian god Maruttash - a warrior god, originally a nature divi- nity associated with peasantry and with wind, rain and growth of food-grains. The Maruts which is the Indian name of the individual Iranian divinity Maruttash were defeated by Indra. They submitted themselves before Indra, became his associates and friends and because of their benevolent nature as nature gods enjoyed all the privileges due to a Vedic deity : 4&lt; So, there is hardly any doubt that it was the Maruttash of Iranians who later became the Maruts of India."109 Hazra is also of the opinion that the Maruts were later associated with Rudra - originally a non- Aryan deity, "for giving him a Vedic stamp, and thus making his entrance into Vedic fold easier, they ( the Aryans ) thought it advisable to associate him with the Maruts as their father and progenitor."11 104 op. cit. p. 81. 106 op. cit . p. 152. 16 Winternitz, M.: (1907, 1st German ed. ) A History of Indian Literature , vol.

The Maruts 633 Among the reasons for associating Rudra with the Maruts, as shown by Hazra, one is that, both were outlandish. As pre-Vedic history of the Aryans is still to be explored, so it is very difficult to prove the historicity of such inference. Hazra also thinks that, the group deities, the Rudras i. e. the host of Rudras, were quite different from the Maruts for whom rudrâ h was just an epithet because of their howling nature.111 L. D. Barnett compares the Maruts with the Iranian Fravasis and says ; " The Maruts are a host of genii dwelling in heaven and constantly waging battles in the sky against the power of darkness and evil especially revealing themselves in the lightning and thunders of the storms that bring rains to parched land of Northern India and revive the force of nature .... Owing to peculiar climatic conditions of India, this function of ruling the storm and thereby giving rains has overshadowed the aspects of the Maruts in the Vedic India and misled the modern scholars into regarding them as primarily and originally storm-gods."112 We would like to observe here that, not only to modern scholars, even to Yãska the Maruts were atmospheric gods repre- senting storms and rains. And, it is difficult to infer the Indian counterparts of the Iranian Fravašis from the textual evidences. Many a scholar support the view that the Maruts were in origin souls of the dead and later they evolved into Indra's associates and storm-gods. A. Kuhn, Benfey, Von Schroeder, Meyer, Hillebrandt, Dandekar, Sukumari Bhattacharji belong to this group of scholars. Historically their opinion 111 Ibid . p. 145. Prof. Dandekar, however, thinks just in the opposite direction. According to him, the Maruts were first associated with Rudra, the god of death, and then with Indra, the warrior-god ( op. cit. p. 238n ). In this connection we would like to refer to Ernst Arbman who also maintains that the Maruts and the Rudras, the group deities, were distinct from each other : " Dass die Maruts als Indras Gefolge an den Kämpfen dieses Gottes gegen die Feinde der Götter und Menschen teilnehmen, entspricht nur ihrem leichten heldenhaften Wesen - wie könnte man sie Rudras finsteren Mordtaten beteiligt denken ? " Rudra , Uppsala, 1932, p. 16. We have already expressed our view in this regard. 112 Barnett, L. D. : (1929) " A Study of the Indo-European Psychology J RAS Part iv, p. 737. Barnett refers to ahi-bhãnu (I. 172. 1) ' radiant as serpents ahi-manyu (1.64. 8 ; 9 ) • having fury of serpents' and connects the Maruts, because of their associa- tion with snakes, with the Italian 4 genius ' who was already figured in art as a young man with a snake ( Ibid. p. 738 ). We would like to comment here that, it was quite natural for the Vedic poets to compare the terrible storm with the brightness, fury and violence of a snake without having any connection with the Italian 'genius'. A.B. Keith also thinks in the same light ( See op. cit. p. 39).</page><page sequence="24">634 ABORI I Amftamahotsava Volume might be valid, but the Rgvedic texts do not bear any evidence in support of their opinion. Macdonell says in this regard : " A. Kuhn, Benfey held the Maruts to be personification of the souls of the dead and with his view Meyer and Von Schroeder substantially agree. This origin is historically possible but the RV furnishes no evidence in support of it."113 A. B. Keith also thinks in the same light : " the only other view of importance is that they are the souls of the dead who go in storm and wind but of this at least ÇF has no hint ; nor is the etymology from mr 4 to die ' enough to serve as a base for the explanation, since their appellation may equally come from a root mr * to shine ' or ť to crush either of which would well accord with their figure. "114 Jan Gonda who believes thai the Maruts were primarily storm- gods, comments in this regard : " Anderen haven mit geringen Erfolg versu- cht diese Gottheiten als die im Sturm dahinfahrende Seeisnschaar zu deuten wofür die Texte aber so gut wie keinen Anhalt geben. "115 Conclusion The same deity appears in different forms at different times to his worshippers. Sometimes the god is all benign to his devotees, at others he appears in destructive mood. And, this is quite natural. The same nature with advent of spring and rains shovvers bliss on humanity, and with drought and flood causes massive havoc on it. The Maruts, also in like manner, possess mutually contradictory elements in their character which fact led the scholars of the past and present to see them in different perspectives and draw different conclusions on their identity. The same is the case with many other deities, especially with the Ašvins. The Rgvedic Maruts are basically storm-gods accompanied by rain and wind. As they are storm-gods so they are bright, noisy, full of anger, fearful, equal in form and age; they are like swans with black backs ( nïlaprsthâh ); their mother is Pršni-the mottled cloud, and the fearful Rudra is their father ; Rodasi who according to the Vedic texts is lightning, is their female associate ; their chariot is drawn by spotted deer ( Pr§atis ) which represent clouds tinged with lightning. They are highly anthropomorphic. Being bri- ghtly dressed and decorated with resplendent golden ornaments, carrying weapons in their hands they march forward shaking heaven and earth, forests, mountains and endangering fears in the minds of the earthly people. But, this is only their outward manifestation. At the base of all such descriptions lies nature. The Maruts, the storm-gods, are only apparently anthropo- morphic ; to us they are nature anthropomorphised. v* op. oit . p. 81. ш op. cit . p. 39. ln op. cit. p. 61.</page><page sequence="25">ChakravarTi : The Maruts 635 The martial elements in the character of the Maruts are also very prominent. Guarded by shoulder-bands, with whips and all kinds of weapons in their hands they proceed in their chariots drawn by the Prsatîs, against their enemies to win battles. Their weapons never fail them in the battle- field. They are ferocious and their victory in the fore-front of battlefield is always guaranteed. That they howl, manifestly full of anger, fearful and are all the same in appearance - all this is not only because they are storm- gods but also because they are soldiers. One sees in their warlike activities the function of the invading Aryans. So, they are described as maryas -, a band of young men, and they move in groups ( cf. šardhas, gana , vrãta , etc. ). Among all the gods the Maruts' relation with Indra is the most intimate. They are his friends and associates. In connection with Indra they become more euhemeristic. They sing Indra's praise ; they also quarrel with him. In the episode of slaying Vjrtra, they aided Indra more by inspir- ing him, by singing laudatory songs and giving war counsels than by actually fighting for him. Along with Indra they enjoy the drink of soma in the sacrifices. The wonderful experiences the newly arrived Aryans had when they observed the stormy weather of this new land, India, and the image of the invading hosts left a deep impression in the minds of the Rgvedic poets. Such experiences received poetic expressions in the songs to the Maruts who in some hymns represent the stormy weather and in others the actual Aryan warriors. Two more or less similar charàcters are mingled in one name - the Maruts. It is difficult to say, which of these characters is earlier, as poems belonging to this category are spread all over in the ÇF, irrespective of earlier or later books. The majority of the hymns dedicated to the Maruts, however, depict them more as nature gods than as gods of war. The Maruts, the Rgvedic storm-gods, have been transformed into rain-gods in the AV , TS and in later Vedic literature. They have a major part to play in the Kãrírísti which is performed for rain. This tells us that the Aryans, now settled in India, started depending on rain for agriculture. The society, now has become sacrifice-oriented. In the TS and the Brähmagas the Maruts are mentioned only when it became necessary to refer to them in connection with the narration of sacrifices. The most prominent change in the character of the Maruts, as obser- ved in the later Vedic literature, is that, they are now finally confirmed in the status of the devavišah i. e. the subjects of the gods, whereas in the R V they are very infrequently mentioned in that manner. Thus, a great fall in their</page><page sequence="26">636 ABORl î Amftamahotsava Volurne position is noticed. Though they were offered the usual jwma-libation in the sacrifices, yet it becomes very evident that they have now lost their grandeur, their brightness with which they made their onward march in the Rgvedic era. That they were not deprived of the ^ma-libation, we believe, is because of the fact, they were indra's people, the royal entourage, indrajyesthãh * with Indra as their chief' - the royal people must, by all means, be rendered due honour and hospitality. The constant effort of subjugating the Maruts ( cf. TS V. 4. 7 ) who were divine subjects, are nothing but the reflections of the efforts of subduing the subjects by the newly arisen power of ' kings local overlords of petty principalities. This power was under constant threat from subjects and from the society which was under the rule of monarchy as monarchical rule now has been fully established ( cf. the eighth pancikã of the Ait . Br. ). Till the days of the Šrautasutras the Maruts, though classified as devavišah i. е. ' the divine subjects *, yet were offered due soma libation along with other divinities. While the other Grhyasütras are silent about the Maruts, in the Pãraskara-grhyasutra they were ear-marked as ahutãda, i. е. the eaters of ^//-offering. Bali is a very ordinary type of offering of rice and grain and that also the sacrificer offers after he has eaten his own share i. e. the mere left-overs -definitely signifying a considerable humiliation for the Maruts.116 Contrary to the Rbhus who, born as human beings, raised themselves to the status of solar deities, the gods of fecunditiy, by dint of their noble deeds, the Maruts, originally storm-gods, warrior gods, Indra's friends and associates, proud receivers of ^owa-libation were demoted to the low status of ôa/z'-eaters. Later, in Sanskrit literature Marut is used in the singular and is the name of the wind-god. Like the majority of Vedic deities, the Maruts also have hardly any function to perform in a Hindu rite. iie We have already discussed in this essay that in the Grhya-sutras the standard of offer- ings to the gods, in a general way, sank very low.</page></plain_text>
