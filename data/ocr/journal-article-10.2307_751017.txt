<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALBERTI AND NIAAPETH A STUDY IN THEIR SOURCES By John Onians I1 ALBERTI ' nless I am mistaken the language of this book is both undeniably Latin and reasonably intelligible.'1 Alberti makes this claim about the De re aedificatoria at the beginning of the sixth book. With five books behind him and five still to come, he pauses to review the obstacles that had faced him in preparing a work on ancient architecture and to explain the methods by which he had surmounted them. Later in the same book, he again refers to his intention to write both in true Latin and intelligibly.2 It is clear that he wishes us to remember the difficulties created by Vitruvius's use of language. Though recognizing Vitruvius's inestimable value, Alberti had criticized him for using a language that was Greek for the Latins and Latin for the Greeks and consequently could be understood by nobody.3 Alberti is determined to avoid this in his own work by paying great attention to his Latinity. Not only are his constructions more Ciceronian than those of Vitruvius but he replaces Greek technical terms with others of Latin derivation. A further comparison of Alberti with Vitruvius reveals that the concern for Latinity affects not only linguistic structure but architectural content. For Vitruvius the basic types of temple were the Greek: Doric, Ionic and Corinthian. The Tuscan temple had been treated briefly in a sort of appendix.4 In Alberti by contrast we find, besides a general assertion of the antiquity of the art of building among the Etruscans, a strong suggestion that the so-called Doric form of capital was in use in Etruria at least as early as in Greece.5 Indeed, he implies, if Italy was probably in at the beginning of the development of columns, she certainly provided the culmination to that development by originating a type unknown to the Greeks, which can only be called Italic.6 This type, which we now call Composite, had, of course, never been mentioned by Vitruvius. Hence Alberti could infer that it was not of Greek origin. It was rather a form that figured prominently on surviving monuments in Rome, more particularly on the Colosseum, where it was to be found on equal terms with the three earlier forms. Alberti may even have thought, like Serlio, that its position above the other forms and its character of a blend between the two richest of those, Ionic and Corinthian, was intended from the first to signify the superiority of Rome over Greece.'

Where history failed to supply enough evidence, he could support his argument with a rhetorical sneer: 'if we are to believe that the Greeks invented everything'.9 Alberti's emphasis on the antiquity of Etruscan architecture can partly be explained as a symptom of the endemic Florentine disease of Tuscan nationalism, just as his boast of Latinity is partly inspired by a desire to put Vitruvius in his place. But his concentration on the language and art of ancient Italy at the expense of Greece is one aspect of a more deep-rooted and significant attitude. This emerges in his brief history of architecture, which is also to be found at the beginning of the sixth book. In a summary we are told that the art of building first appeared in Asia, then flourished in Greece and 'finally achieved maturity and perfection in Italy'.10 What he means and more especially why, by the use of the term probatissimam, he hints that the perfection is moral is made clear in the following paragraphs. The architecture of the Asiatic kings was characterized by great size and impressiveness, that of the Greeks, who were both poorer and wiser, was more refined and carefully planned, but the Romans, who came to wealth and power from modest and humble origins, constructed buildings that combined all qualities in moderation. They were disposed 'to blend the grandeur of the greatest kings with their ancient frugality, so that neither did meanness prevent the attainment of functional sufficiency nor did attention to function alone make them stingy in expenditure. Within the limits of these considerations they did all they could think of to increase the delicacy and beauty of their buildings'.11 It is particularly the restraint of the Romans that Alberti would have us admire. The early Romans above all had this virtue. 'The Italians, because of their natural frugality, decided for the first time that buildings should be like animals. For they noticed that those horses whose limbs seemed suited for particular functions usually proved most efficient for those same jobs. Hence they thought that beauty of form could never be separated from function and utility.'12 The same point is insisted on much later; 'Among our forefathers I observe that the most careful and moderate of them took great delight in frugality and restraint, not only in their public and private dealings, but also in building and they thought that no luxury should be allowed to persist among the citizen body.'13 Alberti makes it clear however that, although luxury is not appropriate to the citizen, magnificence may certainly be appropriate to a city, especially to ancient Rome: 'Because architecture had long been a guest in Italy and felt that she was eagerly studied there, she decided to do all she could to render the Roman Empire more admirable in its ornaments, just as had all the other arts. So she gave herself to be thoroughly known and understood, 8 'Quod merito prae his comprobes': De re aed., vii, 6. 9 Op. cit., vi, 6. 10 'Postremo probatissimam adepta est maturita- tem in Italia', op. cit., vi, 3. 11 Op. cit., vi, 3- 12 Op. cit., vi, 3. 13 Op. cit., ix, I.</page><page sequence="3">98 JOHN ONIANS thinking it a shame that the capital of the world and the glory of all nations should be equalled in her monuments by those whom she had surpassed in all other skills.'14 The superiority of Roman architecture was a fitting complement to her superiority in other fields. Alberti's desire to write in pure Latin, his concentration on the columnar forms of Italy and his admiration for the perfection of Roman architecture, all create a pattern. This pattern enhances the reputation of ancient Italy at the expense of Greece. It also distinguishes Alberti's interests and approach emphatically from those of Vitruvius. The ancient writer was still a mouth- piece for the Greek stage of architectural development. Rationality and intellectual refinement are the qualities he most reveres. Alberti is the spokesman for the final, the Roman stage. This, we have seen, was characterized chiefly by its moral quality. The Roman architect was neither miserly nor extravagant, but, while keeping his mind focused on the problem of utility, still did what he could to increase the elegance and beauty of his buildings. There was no hint of such a characterization in Vitruvius and although it does derive from a passage in an ancient text, as I will show later, it was Alberti's idea to introduce it as the principle behind all Roman architecture. His purpose was evidently to claim the same moral quality for his own treatise, which was based specifically on Roman theory and practice. The principle was certainly in harmony with the then prevalent Christian-Aristotelian morality. The indubitable vices of miserliness and extravagance were avoided and the essential goal of utility was obtained. The more dubious attributes of elegance and beauty were only sought within the framework of this principle. Archi- tecture in the fifteenth century felt itself extremely exposed to criticism on moral grounds. The expenditure of money and effort on buildings, even churches, implied an excessive interest in the earthly and the temporal and could often be interpreted as inspired by a desire for personal glory. Proof of the profound influence of this critical atmosphere is found in the fact that no great builder of the middle of the century could afford to leave his reputation undefended. The accounts of the building activities of Branda Castiglione, Nicholas V and Pius II all constitute apologiae on different grounds. Not surprisingly the greatest builder of them all, Cosimo de' Medici, had the most elaborate defence. Timoteo Maffei, in a long dialogue, set about refuting the thesis that the magnificence for which Cosimo was renowned was 'by Christian standards more of a vice than a virtue'.15 As a verbal builder, reconstructing the architecture of antiquity, Alberti too was aware of the need to avoid attacks. There was no better way than by showing that whatever was true of the Asiatics and the Greeks, the Romans who were his authorities were supremely characterized by the morality of their buildings. But Alberti obviously had to do more than just assert the morality of his models, the Romans. He had to integrate morality into the very structure 14 Op. cit., vi, 3. 15 'Vitium magis apud Christianos quam virtu- tem', see G. Lami, Deliciae Eruditorum, xii, Florence 1745, PP. I50ff.

We have already observed how he mentions with obvious approval the delight of the wisest of the ancients in frugality in building and their hostility to the pursuit of luxury by private citizens. Already at the beginning of his treatise he had praised sobriety and criticized the unrestrained desire to build.16 But he needed to show how individual buildings could be moral, too. This he did by applying to architecture a well-known principle, that of decorum. 'That which we should praise first in an architect is the ability to judge what is appropriate'-'quid deceat'.17 He proceeds to apply this principle particularly to the morally more vulnerable secular buildings. A basilica should not attempt to equal a templum. Neither should it be raised on so high a podium, nor should its decoration have the gravitas required in a sacred structure.'8 The architec- ture of private buildings as a whole should be very restrained but it may employ greater freedom in details. Yet although they do not have to follow the same exact rules as public buildings do they should never become ugly or depraved. Public works must attend to gravitas and the letter of the law but private may tend to iocunditas.'9 As an example, Alberti refers to the festivissimus use of figures to support the door lintels of triclinia and of columns copied from tree trunks in garden porticoes.20 The opposition between gravitas and festivitas in the last passage is one that recurs. Town houses should give an impression of gravitas but villas may have the attractive quality offestivitas.21 Even within the town house, the portico and vestibule should tend to gravitas but the inner rooms to festivitas. Whatever happens, in all environments, the qualities should not be mixed: gravitas and maiestas should be kept quite apart from iocunditas and festivitas.22 A similar opposition is seen in his assertion that temples to male gods should be decorated with gravitas and those to female with venustas.23 This is certainly based on Vitruvius's recommendation of Doric and Corinthian for tough and tender deities respectively.24 Earlier Alberti himself had ascribed the quality offestivitas to Corinthian.25 Thus the masculine Doric and feminine Corinthian embody the same contrast. This last observation leads us to the source of Alberti's idea. No such clear opposition is to be found in Vitruvius. Instead we are reminded of Cicero, who says in the De officiis that 'there are two types of beauty. One is characterized by venustas and the other by dignitas. Venustas we should consider a feminine trait and dignitas masculine'.26 Like Alberti, Cicero is insistent that the two should not be mixed. That Alberti's two terms gravitas and festivitas are equivalent to Cicero's pair dignitas and venustas and that he knew this passage is confirmed by the fact that he uses one term from each pair for his own characterization of the masculine and the 16 De re aed., i, 9. 17 Op. cit., ix, I0. 18 Op. cit., vii, 14-. 19 Op. cit., ix, I. 20 Loc. cit. 21 Op. cit., ix, 2. 22 Op. cit., ix, 4- 23 Op. cit., vii, 3- 24 Vitruvius, De architectura, i, 2. 25 De re aed., vii, 6. 26 Cicero, De oficiis, i, 36.</page><page sequence="5">I00 JOHN ONIANS feminine: gravitas and venustas. The reason why he did not throughout use the terms of Cicero is probably because he wanted words to describe character or spirit, rather than merely types of beauty. The words he uses are in any case Ciceronian, being used to mean 'seriousness' and 'gaiety', applied both to manners generally and to rhetoric in particular. If Alberti wanted a model for the application of moral terms to an art, rhetoric provided an excellent one and there are many echoes of Cicero's rhetorical treatises in the De re aedificatoria. Is there other evidence to substantiate the suggestion that Alberti was influenced by the De officiis in his treatment of architecture? In another case, where he talks about architectural behaviour, but not strictly in terms of appropriateness, he refers again to the heights of podia. 'The podium of a private house should not be more lofty (superbior) than is necessary to link it to the adjoining buildings.'27 This means more than just that the podium should match those of neighbours for visual reasons. The use of the word superbus and not altus shows that the greater height would be tantamount to an arrogant claim to greater status. It is thus exactly an architectural expression of Cicero's declaration in the De officiis that 'the private citizen ought rightly to live on terms of equality with his fellow citizens, being neither submissive nor superior (neque summissum et abjectum neque se eferentem)'.28 In a later passage, Alberti even seems to echo the construction of this sentence. He does not approve of the addition of fortifications to private houses, because these are appropriate to the castles of tyrants rather than to the houses of citizens living at peace in a well-ordered state. 'They imply either fear or hostility (aut conceptum metum aut paratam iniuriam significent).'29 In one passage in the De oficiis, Cicero himself deals with architecture. He discusses what is the proper sort of house. 'The object (finis) of a house is to be useful and the design should be made with that goal in mind, but at the same time attention should be given to comfort and dignity.'30 This is evidently the basis for Alberti's characterization of the whole of Roman architecture, which I quoted earlier: the Romans concentrated on the problem of utility but did what they could to create elegance and beauty. As in the previous instance, we note that Alberti uses different words to express a similar thought with a similar construction. This occurs also when Alberti takes Cicero's statement a little farther on that 'a man's dignity is to be enhanced by his house (ornanda enim est dignitas domo)' and expands it into: 'Because we decorate our house as much to adorn our fatherland and family (patriae familiaeque condecorandae) as for the sake of elegance, who will deny that such activity is the duty of a good man (boni viri oficium) ?'31 Alberti here comes as near as he ever does to admitting his debt to this particular treatise of Cicero by his use of the word officium. But this word appears in another passage, where its use is even more significant. Alberti says that the ancients realized that 'different buildings should have different forms because they saw that they differed from each other in purpose and function (fine et oficio)'.32 This is the first case I know 27 De re aed., ix, 2. 28 De officiis, i, 34- 29 De re aed., ix, 4. 30 De officiis, i, 39. 31 De officiis, i, 39, and De re aed., ix, I. 32 De re aed., ix, 5.</page><page sequence="6">ALBERTI AND FIAAPETH IOI of an inanimate object being said to have an officium. Although the meaning of the word is not precisely the same as that it has in Cicero's treatise, where it is the translation of a Greek technical term -rO Ka'lKov, moral duty, it is very doubtful that Alberti understood the subtle changes of meaning the word had gone through in antiquity. What is interesting to observe is that Alberti applies to buildings a word that had usually been reserved for men and that he uses this application as the basis for formulating his theory that different buildings should have different decorative forms- in this case Doric, Ionic and Corinthian. He thus equates the principle of his theory of architectural forms with that of Cicero, who had shown that a man should vary his actions according to his circumstances or his role in life. This assimilation of architectural forms to human actions is possible for Alberti only because he is determined to show that buildings, like men, can be subject to the rules of morality. The principle to which Alberti refers in the last passage discussed is in fact that of decorum, which was mentioned earlier. Not surprisingly, this principle is referred to explicitly by both Alberti and Cicero with equal insistence on its importance. We have already quoted Alberti's statement that the 'first ability to praise in an architect is his capacity to judge what is appropriate (quid deceat)'. Cicero had said that decorum, the Latin trans- lation of the Greek "-r5 rpE-rrov, was so important in morality 'that it cannot be separated from moral rectitude, for what is appropriate is morally right and what is morally right is appropriate.'33 The notion of decorum had, of course, been applied already in antiquity to many arts, as to rhetoric by Cicero and poetry by Horace, but in none of these was it given the over-riding importance here attributed to it by Alberti. His model in this statement can only be the De officiis, whatever the detailed influences from the ancient theory of rhetorical decorum may be elsewhere in the work. Vitruvius had been influenced by the theory in one important passage, but the influence is isolated and comes directly from rhetoric.34 The contrast between Vitruvius and Alberti is seen in the fact that while Vitruvius uses a part of the verb deceo only once in his whole ten books, Alberti frames many of his injunctions with its aid. So far I have dealt only with the influence of the De officiis on Alberti's thought in general and on some detailed opinions in particular. But the ancient moral treatise affected the whole structure of Alberti's presentation of architecture. The place where Alberti reveals most about his working methods is, as we saw, at the beginning of the sixth book. Here, at one point, he declares that he has dealt with the two parts of architecture that concern usefulness and strength (ad usum apta and ad perpetuitatemfirmissima) and that it remains to treat of how grace and attractiveness (gratia and amenitas) are to be obtained. These two qualities, he proceeds to state, derive undeniably from beauty and ornament (pulchritudo and ornamentum), and these will be the subject of the remaining half of the work.35 With the exception of the last book, which deals with restoration and a few other odds and ends, the whole is thus divided into two equal parts, one concerned with functional aspects and 33 De officiis, i, 27. 34 De architectura, i, 2. 35 De re aed., vi, I and 2.</page><page sequence="7">102 JOHN ONIANS the other with decorative. In fact, the two parts run parallel, so that for example in the first book columns are treated in terms of their function and their essential parts, while in the sixth book it is shown that they can be given different sorts of ornament to make them Doric or Ionic, for example. This division has no parallel in Vitruvius, who moves step by step from the elements of architecture to materials, to temples, to public buildings and so on. No previous discussion of architecture had hinted at Alberti's separation between structure and decoration. In the De officiis, however, Cicero introduces his second book with a preface reminding his son that in the first book he has shown how officia are derived from honestas (moral rectitude) and that he will now discuss the relation between officia and the material aspects of life, concentrating on the problem of what is useful and what is not useful (quid utile, quid inutile).36 Indeed, of the three books of the De officiis the first deals with honestas, the second with utilitas and the third with the problem of reconciling those two ideas. The possibility that Alberti's division may be based on Cicero's is suggested first of all by the formal resemblance in arrangement. Not only is the division between the two sections in both cases marked by a linking passage but in both cases the initial sentence of this linking passage summarizes the content of the first section. Moreover, Alberti uses exactly the same idiom to refer to the previous section: superioribus libris where Cicero says libro superiore. It is easy to see the connexion in subject between the first five books of Alberti and the second book of Cicero. Both concentrate on the term utilitas as the heading under which to discuss functionalism, usefulness, expediency and need. The connexion between Cicero's honestas and Alberti's pulchritudo and ornamentum is at first less obvious. Yet Cicero himself explains the connexion in the De officiis itself. 'And it is no mean manifestation of Nature and Reason that man is the only animal that has a feeling for order, for propriety (quod deceat), for modera- tion in word and deed. And so no other animal has a sense of beauty, loveli- ness, harmony in the visible world; and Nature and Reason, extending the analogy of this from the world of the sense to the world of the spirit, find that beauty (pulchritudo), consistency, order are far more to be maintained in thought and deed, and the same Nature and Reason are careful to do nothing in an improper or unmanly fashion, and in every thought and deed to do or think nothing capriciously.'37 Honestas is the quality which the human animus approves in actions. It is the exact counterpart of the pulchritudo that the oculus recognizes in outward appearances. In his treatment of a visual art, then, it was natural for Alberti to devote a section to the discussion of pulchritudo (aesthetic rectitude) as matching Cicero's account of honestas (moral rectitude) in his study of morality. Alberti evidently understood the Platonic theory of man's innate desire for the beautiful and the good, that is harmony, that lay behind Cicero. 'For the eyes are by nature especially desirous of beauty and harmony.'38 And this too he could have derived from a passage in the De oficiis almost immediately following that just quoted: 'You see here, Marcus, my son, the 36 De officiis, ii, I. 37 Op. cit., i, 4. 38 De re aed., ix, 8.</page><page sequence="8">ALBERTI AND DIAAPETH Io3 very form and as it were the face of Moral Goodness; "and if", as Plato says, "it could be seen with the physical eye, it would awaken a marvellous love of wisdom".'39 Alberti makes one significant change in adapting the structure of the moral treatise to his own on architecture. He reverses the order of the two main sections. Cicero had treated honestas before utilitas, because it was obviously a criterion of higher importance in moral decisions. But architecture, as Alberti realized, was not an exactly analogous field. Indeed, it was Cicero who defined the difference for him. Cicero, we remember, had said that the prime object of a house was usefulness and that visual impressiveness was only a secondary consideration in its design. As Alberti had taken over this idea, applied it to the whole of Roman architecture and consequently to the whole subject of his book, it followed that he had to deal with the whole problem of usefulness first and beauty second. This scheme also conformed well with the fact that a building was usually finished structurally before its decoration was brought to completion. It may seem strange that, if Cicero's work had the overwhelming impor- tance for Alberti's treatise which I suggest, it still received no explicit mention. But writers of the period frequently omit direct references to their major sources. Usually they refer to previous works either to display their erudition or to add authority to their own thoughts. No one would have thought Alberti erudite for referring to what was possibly the best-known classical text. Nor did he need to appeal directly to its authority, as the respectability of his ideas and their source would have been immediately recognized by his readers. His personal involvement in the De officiis had already been demonstrated in the Della famiglia, which owed to Cicero's work not only much of the content and phraseology but also the division into three books. The importance of the work for the Renaissance as a whole is unquestionable. Petrarch had said 'you would fancy sometimes that it is not a pagan philosopher but a Christian apostle who is speaking'.40 The De officiis was (with the De oratore, also by Cicero, and with works of Lactantius) one of the first classical books to be printed in 1465 at Subiaco, and was alone in being published in the same year also at Mainz.41 Alberti's use of Cicero is not surprising, but it is revealing. His choice of model demonstrates his awareness that one of the main obstacles to architec- tural development in the fifteenth century was the belief that too great an interest in building in general and in the imitation of ancient architecture in particular was difficult to reconcile with accepted morality. He endeavoured to remove that obstacle by showing that the best of ancient architecture, that of Rome, was in fact only an extension of one of the most widely accepted moral systems. The effect his choice of model had on the future history of architecture and of architectural theory cannot be overemphasized. His division of his work and the whole treatment of his subject in terms of usus andpulchritudo/ornamentum 39 De oficiis, i, 5. 40 Cicero, De officiis, Loeb Classical Library, London 1915, translated with introduction by W. Miller, p. xii. 41 Op. cit., p. xiii.</page><page sequence="9">104 JOHN ONIANS gave the opposition between the two aspects of architecture enormous authority. Applying the Ciceronian dualism to architecture, Alberti formu- lates for the first time the opposition between structure and ornament. He himself did not see the opposition in its extreme form, as for him pulchritudo included proportions, which should be inherent in the structure. But, as the importance of proportion declined very rapidly, the contrast became more and more that between the functional structure of a building and its decoration. The diffusion of this notion from such an authoritative source as Alberti must have played an important part in creating the situation that lasted four hundred years, in which architecture could preserve the same structure while changing with increasing frequency its clothing of decoration. Certainly it has only been a devotion to the same distinction that has allowed architects in the last hundred years to deny the need for any ornament at all and to concentrate on utilitarian considerations alone. If he would not approve of quite such an extreme point of view, Alberti would certainly recognize as his own many of the moral arguments used to support it. Before Alberti there had been no hint of the separation between structure and ornament. For Vitruvius, as for later writers, a building was an integrated whole from the finest carving on its surface to the unformed rubble of its core. II: NIAAPETH To say that Alberti's use of the De oficiis is not surprising is not to imply that it was as inevitable as was his dependence on Vitruvius. But his choice of the best-known work of the most respected author of antiquity as his model was much more obvious than that made by Filarete a few years later. Alberti's work was probably completed in Rome in 1452, that of Filarete in Milan in 1464.42 Although the purpose of both treatises is to improve the image of architecture in general and to develop an interest in ancient architecture in particular, they differ strikingly in form and content. The most obvious difference in form is that Alberti writes in Ciceronian Latin and Filarete in fairly 'vulgar' Italian. The greatest contrast in content is that Alberti writes for a republican aristocracy who worship superi while Filarete speaks as a courtier to his God-fearing lord. These differences can be related to Filarete's different social position, his craftsman origins and his current employment as a retainer at the Sforza court. There are however many more differences which cannot be so easily explained and which are also differences from Vitruvius. Filarete begins his treatise with the Creation in truly Christian fashion but he adds a novel detail, saying that man's body was made by God 'organized and measured, pro- portionate in all its limbs'.43 He then goes on to say that the first architect 42 For the dating of Alberti's work see C.

Thus he establishes all the elements of architecture, the measurements (e.g. feet), the forms (e.g. head/capital) and the proportions (e.g. I : ) from man inscribed in the square. After this preamble, Filarete's lord decides to build a city using this ancient anthropomorphic architecture. This is nearing completion when, at the end of book twelve, a new site suitable for a city is found on the coast of the lord's territory. At the beginning of the thirteenth book it is suggested that building begin there too. Preliminary site exploration is carried out and brings to light some ruins and a golden book, which is a record of a city that existed on the site many years before and contains many architectural descriptions. The book is written in Greek and has to be deciphered by the court scholar. It is decided to rebuild this city, which was called Plousiapolis, as it was and this the lord is enabled to do by the discovery, with the book, of some dust which turns out to be extremely valuable. Building of the two cities proceeds con- currently, but particular attention is paid to expounding the economic, social and educational organization of the first. The treatise proper terminates with the twenty-fourth book. The twenty-fifth book was added only when it was decided to offer the book to Piero de' Medici as well as to the Duke of Milan. It contains an account of Medici building activity. The whole treatise is in the form of a dialogue between the architect and the lord and his son, interspersed with brief narrative sections. It is evident that the treatise is quite different in character from that of Alberti, which follows the Vitruvian model very closely as a ten-book account of an art, with some Ciceronian alterations in structure. It would be very attractive to be able to point to one book as the source of all the new features in Filarete. This is not possible. There is no one book that could have inspired them all. There is however a collection of books that could have done so. This is a group of the dialogues of Plato. The following is a list of these dialogues, with a summary of the main elements which may have influenced Filarete. The Timaeus describes how the divine demiurge designed the universe and man in the image of the universe. The Critias is an account of two separate and different cities, including details of their planning and architectural organization. The Laws contains a description of an ideal city in terms of its laws, political system, society, educational structure and economy. It is also divided into twelve books. All are in the dialogue form. The arguments against even the possibility that Filarete used these dialogues are quite forceful. He mentions Plato only once and then in a very insignificant context. There is no evidence that he knew Greek. In 1460, none of the dialogues concerned were available in Latin translation except parts of the Timaeus. Even Greek manuscript copies were extremely rare.44 All these arguments can be combated. Alberti himself never mentions his main source besides Vitruvius: the De officiis. Filarete does actually hint at his use of an unidentified Greek source. This is the golden book which is dug up at the coastal site and is emphatically described as being in Greek.

Filelfo is referred to several other times by Filarete. He composes the inscription for the Ospedale; he interprets the hieroglyphics on the amphitheatre in Rome; he composes an epigram for a bridge; he recommends the patronage of artists and writers; and finally he interprets the hordini et statuti of the country described in the golden book. Filarete evidently relied on him in all matters of scholarship. We know from Filelfo's side that he too was proud to be a friend of Filarete. The artist is mentioned several times in his correspondence. In a Latin letter of March 1447, he recommends Filarete as: Antonius Florentinus fictor et excussor egregius aeque tempestate nostra atque Praxitelem apud priscos memorant, Copanve, aut Phidian aliquem, et te diligit plurimum et mihi est carissimus.46 Again in 1465 in a Greek letter he recommends him to a friend in Istanbul: He is a good man and one of my best friends.... He is also skilled in many beautiful works and is a particularly excellent architect.47 Filelfo had indeed already referred to Filarete as a 'KOlvbS qn0oS' in a letter dated 1456.48 It is in this last year that we find also in Filelfo's correspondence evidence of his interest in Plato. On 3I May 1456, he writes to Andronicus of Gallipoli, the Duke's librarian at Pavia: 'I have heard that in the Duke's library in the castle there are preserved all Plato's philosophical works. I am very anxious to learn the truth of this from you and especially whether the Laws are there. The latter I would like you to copy for me in your own hand. In return you would be well rewarded.'49 This inquiry about Plato, and particularly the Laws, is followed up in June with a more testy letter reminding the said Andronicus of the earlier request.50 We do not know whether Filelfo received the copy he asked for, nor whether he perhaps had to go to the library himself. Nor do we know for what purpose he wanted to consult the Laws in particular. Fortunately we do, however, know exactly which manuscript he was referring to. The 1459 Pavia inventory has a garbled entry: Platonis greci videlicet disputatio Socratis cum Chritofonte Politie. Timeus Platonis. Christias Platonis. De Lege. Leges Platonis. Phedrus 45 Filarete, xiv, fol. Io2r. Historical and literary parallels to this discovery and study of an ancient book are to be found in W. Speyer, Biicherfunde in der Glaubenswertung der Antike.

Epistole Platonis. Diffinitiones Platonis. Confabulationes Platonis. Demodocus de consilio. Critias de divitiis. Axiochus de morte.51 Not only, then, were all the dialogues that concern us available near Milan, but Filelfo was interested in the very manuscript containing them at a very appropriate time, eight years before Filarete completed his treatise. Having thus shown that Filarete, through Filelfo, could indeed have known the contents of the three relevant dialogues I must now proceed to examine in the case of each invididual dialogue the evidence that he really did. The dialogue that contains the most architectural material is the Critias. In it, Plato puts into the mouth of Critias an account of Attica and the rival city of Atlantis, as they existed nine thousand years before. Critias had the account from his ancestor Solon, who in turn heard it from the Egyptian priests, who possessed written records of that distant time. This mention of the survival of a written account of a lost civilization, complete with details of its architecture and organization, could have stimulated Filarete to introduce his golden book, with its similar account. Plato describes two different cities, the simple Athens and the luxurious Atlantis. Filarete also describes two cities, one Sforzinda designed on fairly rational principles and one on the coast which is a reconstruction of the city of Plousiapolis (Greek, 'Rich City') and contains many much more fantastic and extravagant structures. This is all paid for with the extraordinarily valuable dust which was found with the golden book. In a rather similar way Plato tells that the wealth and magnificence of Atlantis was due to the possession of mines of a fabulous substance called orichalcum. Another of the important ways in which Athens is contrasted with Atlantis is that it is sited on the Akropolis away from the sea, while Atlantis is right on the coast. The same contrast exists between Filarete's two cities. Also in the Critias, Plato says that the city of Atlantis was built of red, white and black rock, because stone of these colours was discovered when digging its foundations.52 In Filarete stones of the same colours are important. The great temple of Plousiapolis was built of such stones (xiv, fol. io8r) and when Filarete goes into the hills to look for marbles he finds them black, white and red, though with a sub-species that is green (xv, fol. I I2r). One of the characteristics of Filarete's buildings is that several of them are surrounded, not just by one moat, but by a whole series of them alternating with rings of land, which are laid out in the form of a maze. Good examples are the castles of Sforzinda and Plousiapolis described and illustrated in vi, fol. 38r and xiii, fol. 99r. Atlantis had consisted basically of a royal palace containing a temple and surrounded by three rings of sea alternating with rings of land, though not in a maze form. It is possible to enumerate further elements common to both books, such as the description of a city sited on a hill in the middle of a plain surrounded by mountains rich in animals and produce, the accounts of land distribution and the detailing of laws and customs. But these 51 E. Pellegrin, La BibliothIque des Visconti et des Sforzas ducs de Milan du XVe sidcle, Paris 1955, P- 310, number B 463. This was probably the same manuscript as a Plato in greco listed in the 1426 inventory (op. cit., p. 98, number A 420) which in its turn may have been the one owned by Petrarch. 52 Critias, I I6b.</page><page sequence="13">i o8 JOHN ONIANS are not so unusual. One detail in Filarete which is unusual, however, is the golden book with its account of the ancient Plousiapolis. The idea for this may have come from Plato's mention that all the legal decisions of Atlantis were written down on gold plates. The Critias is itself only an appendix to the Timaeus, where a more general account of Atlantis is found. But this is in turn only a prelude to the exposition by Timaeus of a myth of creation, beginning with the question 'after what model did the maker of the universe fashion it', and going on to answer 'after himself'. Thus he made the Cosmos as a living creature, a smooth sphere containing everything. He then had his children, the gods, make men and women after the same model but with certain necessary additions. The emphasis throughout is on rationality, the mean, proportion, harmony and order. Right at the outset the Creator is called 'the architect'.53 This could have prepared the way for Filarete's assimilation of man in his architectural capacity to God. Filarete, of course, left out the universe as in the Hebrew creation story it was only man that was made in God's image. Plato says that the Creator decided that all should be as far as possible copied from himself and that his children imitated this in making man.54 Filarete says that God wished that man, just as he was made in His image, should in his turn make something in imitation of himself (i, fol. 5v). In both cases the stress is on imitating God, and on transferring forms and proportions from something higher to something lower. Filarete knew the Vitruvian account of human proportions and was inspired by the Tiniaeus to explain it and give it greater authority by linking it to the Christian Creation story. He took no more elements from Plato than were necessary to make the link. Only one detail of the Timaeus seems to have made a strong independent impression. Neither Alberti, nor Vitruvius, nor the Bible, had paid any particular attention to the head as being more important than the rest of the body. Only in the neo- Platonic tradition and in the canons of workshop practice was the head treated as specially significant. But nothing in such writers as Augustine or Cennini prepares us for Filarete's discussion of the subject. He attaches such impor- tance to the head that he gives the proportions of both men and columns only in terms of head-heights or capital-heights and even eliminates those capital forms which do not have the proportions of the human head. He explains this by saying that the first architects, copying the body of Adam, which was the most perfect, took their first measure from his head, 'il piu degnio membro e il piu bello' (i, fol. 3v). This is closely parallel to a passage in the Timaeus, where the gods when making the first man, start with the head which is the 'most divine [part of the body] and ruler of the whole of it'.55 The head is always the most important element in the dialogue, because it is copied from the sphere of the universe, which in its turn is copied from the nature of the Creator. Plato's Laws is a discussion of every aspect of life in a city community and its surrounding territory. It is in twelve books. Filarete's treatise is composed of twenty-four with the twenty-fifth forming an appendix. A division can be made at the end of the twelfth book. The first twelve books are concerned 53 Timaeus, 28c. 64 Op. cit., 29c and 69c. 55 Op. cit., 44d.</page><page sequence="14">ALBERTI AND DIAAPETH Io9 almost entirely with Sforzinda. The last are not so unified in subject. Although the reading of the golden book and the construction of Plousiapolis in accor- dance with the book's description proceeds quite consistently at first, digres- sions occur about work remaining at Sforzinda. Some of this is also inspired by the golden book. But finally the last three books are quite unrelated and are devoted chiefly to drawing lessons for the lord's son. Probably, however, we should still see the work as consisting of two twelve-book sections, each of which concentrates on a different city and is thus equivalent to the Laws. The corre- spondence with the Laws is most obvious in the last twelve books. There it is specifically a Greek polis that is being described. Many elements in these books of Filarete are paralleled in the Laws, but in no other work that I know. Both Plato and Filarete, for example, give detailed accounts of schools for boys and girls. Both insist on the value of competitions and training in the intellectual and military fields.56 At a later stage both writers describe prisons and the penal system and in Filarete these are explicitly based on the golden book.57 Both divide their prisons into three named sections for different classes of criminals; though Filarete has one building in the country divided vertically into three and Plato has three separate buildings, one in the city centre, one away from the centre and one in the country.58 Following this, both describe property rights.59 Not only is there a correspondence in the sequence of treatment but even in large part in the numbering of the books: prison and legal system are described in Laws vii and viii and in Filarete xvii and xviii; and property rights in x and xx respectively. This could, of course, be a coincidence. But I would interpret it as indicating that Filarete probably had before him a written book-by-book summary of the contents of the Platonic dialogue made by Filelfo. If he had such for the Laws, he may have also had written summaries of the other two dialogues. Filarete says that the golden book was actually 'trascripto' by Iscofrance (xiv, fol. Io3r). The fact that in no subject does Filarete give the same directions as Plato, but relates everything to his own day as surely as Plato did to his, may suggest that what was written down by Filelfo was only a skeleton. Other dialogues in the Pavia manuscript may have influenced Filarete, but I have found no striking connexions. Indeed, none of the major problems of the sources of structure and subject matter remaining after the recent researches of Tigler and Spencer are still unsolved once the Critias, Timaeus and Laws have been brought into the discussion. It is not difficult to see why these three are the important dialogues. The Laws was of particular interest to Filelfo himself and contained a detailed account of a city's institutions. The Timaeus, with its interest in order and proportion and its characterization of the Creator as architect, could easily be connected with architecture-as is proved by its influence on later architectural theory.60 The Critias contains the most architectural material of any Platonic dialogue. A work such as the Republic, which was also available, was much less systematic and concrete than the Laws and consequently much less useful. 56 Compare Laws, vii and viii, with Filarete, xvii and xviii. 51 Laws, x, and Filarete, xx, fol. 165r. 58 Laws, 9o8a, and Filarete, loc. cit. 59 Laws, xi, and Filarete, xx. 60 R. Wittkower, Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism, London 1962, pp. 25, I II, etc.</page><page sequence="15">IIo JOHN ONIANS Having demonstrated Filarete's dependence on Platonic material, we now have to reconstruct how this came about. This has to be done on the basis of inference. Filelfo wanted to consult the copy of the Laws in Pavia in 1456. Eventually he either had the manuscript copied in toto, or went to consult it personally, or arranged to borrow it. At the same time Filarete was beginning the construction of the great Ospedale for the Duke. The two had long been friends and consequently the scholar may have brought to the architect's attention the architectural material in the Plato manuscript. It is possible that Filarete had already decided to write a treatise on building and that this is why Filelfo introduced him to the ancient source. I am more disposed to believe that it was as a result of their discussion of the Platonic material, and at Filelfo's instigation, that Filarete had the idea of writing at all. No reason has yet been given why this architect, who showed no interest in writing otherwise, should suddenly have sat down to write a book about his art. This suggestion is confirmed by the close dependence on Plato of the whole scheme of the work. Moreover, the seminal role of Filelfo may be suggested by the parallel between Filarete's treatise and the Sforziad, a work on which Filelfo was engaged at this time. The Sforziad glorified the ducal family of Milan. It was modelled on the Iliad and consequently was to be in twenty-four books.61 Filarete's treatise was also in honour of the Sforzas, was also in twenty-four books and was also modelled on the work of a Greek writer. It is this last feature which is most important and points most clearly to the decisive role played by Filelfo in the conception of the treatise. Only he can be responsible for its many Greek elements. Indeed, we should not speak of Greek elements but of Greek character. For the result of the fact that the golden book is in Greek is that the ancient architecture that is reconstructed is specifically Greek architecture. Moreover the port and coastal city inherit their Greek names, Limen Galenokairen and Plousiapolis, and are decorated with Greek inscriptions. Indeed the treatise has a Greek character even before the golden book is discovered. Right at the beginning, Filarete mentions only Doric, Ionic and Corinthian columns, omitting all mention of either Vitruvius's Tuscan or Alberti's Italic, although he knew both treatises well.62 Our recognition of the Greek character of the treatise and of the Platonic character in particular now enables us to understand the significance of the name Filarete itself. This is, of course, not a family or baptismal name but one acquired by Antonio Averlino when a man, derived from the Greek tpi\apETroS meaning 'lover of virtue'.63 This word occurs rarely in ancient literature. Much the most accessible example of it was one in the Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle. But the ancient writer who had attributed most significance to the word &amp;pE-r was Plato. More specifically, the last pages of the Laws are entirely devoted to its discussion. The development of this quality in the citizens is the one object of all the laws in the city. We have already observed that Filarete modelled several of his institutions on those described in the Laws. 61 M.

For another person named Filarete see note 72 below.</page><page sequence="16">ALBERTI AND DIAAPETH III He even went so far in adopting a Platonic tone as to call his main educational centre the 'Casa Areti'.64 The notion of virtz was certainly so important in the fifteenth century that it is not strange that Filarete should use it in his treatise. But the fact that he uses not this well-known Latin derivative, but the Greek form, shows that he is alluding to something rather more precise than the generally accepted idea. There is certainly nothing to suggest that he really understood the peculiar character of Platonic areti, but this must be what he has in mind. If the values of his treatise are, at least in this case, the same as those of the Laws it is not surprising that Averlino should have claimed them as his own too. It is probably not insignificant that the first association of a form of the word filarete with Averlino is in the introduction to the treatise itself and that it is used there as an adjective applied by the writer to himself- 'your filareto architect'-not as a name.65 It is likely and indeed appropriate that Averlino only acquired this attribute at the time that he was writing his modern architectural version of the Laws. Presumably he was thus 'christened' by the high priest of Greek culture in Milan, Filelfo. In the concern for aretj displayed both in the treatise and in his own adopted name, Filarete came closer to being truly Platonic than in anything else except his belief in a God who created man with a body that was ordered and proportioned. He could only understand and accept these two aspects of Plato's thought because both could be related to current beliefs. The impor- tance of virtue was a common-place of moral thought and the theory of human proportions had been transmitted from Vitruvius and others into conventional workshop training. But his penetration of Platonic ideas is amazing if we con- sider that Filarete relied throughout on Filelfo as his interpreter and could never really study and assimilate the works for himself. There were few indeed even of the most learned humanists who could have got more from Plato at this period. Ficino had yet to make his complete translation. All this explains the difference between the influence of Plato on Filarete and that of Cicero on Alberti. Alberti assimilates and applies much of the system of thought of the De oficiis. Filarete takes from the Critias, Timaeus and Laws the structure of composition of his treatise, his didactic method and his major themes. Yet the same significance attaches to both authors' choice of model. Both, when trying to discuss classical architecture in a way that would lend it authority in the mid-fifteenth century, turned to texts of ethical philosophy. In view of this common approach it becomes important to establish why their choices were so different. We have seen that Alberti's choice was not surpris- ing; so it is on Filarete's that we must concentrate. The answer lies, I believe, in the very reason why Filarete should have chosen to write a treatise on architecture only a few years after Alberti, in the first place. If we consider the fact that Filarete had a Greek name, reconstructed Greek buildings and dealt only with Greek columns we notice a striking contrast with Alberti, who deliberately removed all Greek words from his Latin vocabulary, who claimed that architecture only reached perfection in ancient Italy and even went to the lengths of inventing an 'Italic' column to prove the point. Filarete's point of view is as assertively Greek as Alberti's is Roman. Because of the chronological sequence, the contrast can only have a polemical intention. If 64 Filarete, xviii, 65 Filarete, Ded., fol. ir,</page><page sequence="17">x12 JOHN ONIANS Filarete knew that the Roman character of Alberti's work was largely a pro- duct of its dependence on the De oficiis it was natural, and almost inevitable, that he should take as his guide a Greek writer on ethics. A choice between Aristotle and Plato could have been decided by Filelfo's discovery of the Plato manuscript, if not by Plato's greater mystery and power. This leads us again to the problem of Filelfo's role in all this. The same reasons that led us to him as the person responsible for the Greek elements of the treatise lead us again to propose him as the man who had the initial idea of writing a specifically Greek treatise. He was well aware that it was because of his understanding of that language that he had a position of authority in the humanistic world. As one of the few Italian scholars who had actually studied in Constantinople (and married a Greek wife) his sense of identification with Greek culture must have been unique. Perhaps this sense alone was enough to make him urge his friend to write a Greek complement to Alberti's work, which was so assertively Roman. But his knowledge of two celebrated texts from earlier in the century may have made him feel that such a reply from Milan was particularly appropriate. Soon after 1400, Leonardo Bruni had written a Laudatio of Florence which had belatedly stimulated Pier Candido Decembrio, about 1435, to compose a Panegyricus on Milan which began by putting both Bruni and Florence firmly in their place.66 The attack on Bruni's work, which he repeated to his friends, was evidently based largely on supposed inadequacies in Bruni's Greek scholarship. Not only did Decembrio introduce Plato and Aristotle in making his case but he gave his work the sophisticated Greek title of Panegyricus, instead of the banal Latin Laudatio used by Bruni. Bruni tried to defend himself in letters by asserting that he too had used Aristides, the Greek source of Decembrio.67 Alberti, like Bruni, was primarily associated with Florence and his exaltation of Roman culture only developed Bruni's ideas. Bruni was the immediate source for his sneer: 'If we are to credit everything to the Greeks,' and the case for Virgil's rank as a philosopher which Alberti was to make in Landino's Camaldoline Disputations had also been supported by the earlier humanist.68 So Filelfo may have felt that it was time once again for Milanese Greek scholarship to show up the southern Latinists. But it is clear that Filelfo's intention was not to antagonize Florence or Florentine scholars as a whole; indeed, it was probably the reverse. After a period of genuine hostility following his banishment by Cosimo, Filelfo was engaged in re-establishing his contacts both with the Medici and Florentine humanists. In 1454, he sent the first four books of his Sforziad to Piero de' Medici and at the same time he had an active correspondence with figures 66 L.

This might be the reason for his unheralded interest in the Plato manuscript in 1456. Filarete, who was him- self Florentine, would have readily joined Filelfo in his attempt to win favour in Florence. He explicitly praises the architecture of his native city in the version of his work dedicated to the Sforza duke, and eventually wrote a separate book on Medici buildings to accompany a copy dedicated to Piero de' Medici. Filelfo eventually achieved his goal of returning to Florence, but only just before he died. The impressive performance of Notilento in the treatise may have played a small part in procuring this. Certainly Lorenzo, who recalled him, was much more seriously involved in Platonism than either Cosimo or Piero. In fact it was only after he had succeeded his father in 1469 that the Academy became a really committed institution and that the work of Ficino made all of Plato accessible.71 Whatever the nature of the connexion between the Milanese treatise and the Florentine Academy it is certain that there was one. For a member of the latter also had the name Filarete.72 This lends weight to the suggestion that in Averlino's case its associations were Platonic. Scholars often judge by appearances, so it is not surprising that Filarete's treatise, unlike Alberti's, has been either neglected or misunderstood. If his accent had been less coarse and his punctuation less erratic the importance of the Greek golden book and the role of Notilento might have been acknow- ledged long ago. Only if we follow these clues does the true significance of the work emerge. It is a uniquely well-documented example of the collaboration between artist and scholar, and an exceptionally early one. Only later was such collaboration in the circle of Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence and at the court ofJulius II at Rome to produce the articulate and intellectual art of the High Renaissance. It is also a landmark in the assimilation of Plato into the European intellectual tradition by a return to the Greek text. Not only does it anticipate the spirit and the achievement of the mature Florentine Academy but it inaugurates a new awareness of the inter-relation between architecture and social organization which depends directly from its Platonic models. Finally, Filarete's treatise is the first work to assume that the highest achievement of ancient art was embodied in Greek rather than in Roman civilization. In this Filarete looks forward to Winckelmann and attempts to 69 A. della Torre, Storia dell'accademia pla- tonica di Firenze, Florence I902, pp. 367-73. 70 Op. cit., pp. 361-7. 71 Op. cit., pp. 585ff. 72 Op. cit., pp. 394 and 402-3. This other Filarete held the post of Florentine herald. His real name was Francesco di Lorenzo. I have been unable to establish when he aquired his nick-name and consequently cannot say whether he imitated or anticipated Antonio Averlino.</page><page sequence="19">114 JOHN ONIANS inspire European art with a new breath that only truly arrived with neo- Classicism. If the architecture that he describes does not have the qualities that we think of as Greek, that is not his fault. Its opulence and complexity derive from Plato's Atlantis, the description of which in the Critias is still one of the fullest architectural descriptions surviving in ancient Greek. The truncated form in which Plato left the dialogue effectively prevented Filelfo and Filarete from realizing that Atlantis was not held up as a model to be imitated. Instead, confirmation that the qualities it embodied were really Greek, could be found in the buildings of the greatest Greek city still surviving, Constantinople. It has been dimly perceived hitherto that Filarete's architecture is influenced by Byzantine churches." We can now see that the domes, mosaics and gold backgrounds, that are recurring features of his buildings, are introduced as essential to an architecture that was distinctively Greek. The break in continuity between classical Greece and Byzantine Constantinople, of which we are so aware, could hardly have been understood by a generation that looked to that city not only for its teachers of classical Greek but for the manuscripts that preserved ancient Greek wisdom. Constantinople was a Greek-speaking polis and 'Greek' was commonly used for 'Byzantine'. Filarete had only seen St. Mark's in Venice, but Filelfo could have provided glowing descriptions of Hagia Sophia. At a time when Constantinople had just fallen to the Turks the feeling that Greek culture should not die with it must have been particularly strong. The treatise seems almost to urge on Francesco Sforza the construction of a new Byzantium, where all that was finest in Greek art and culture would find a new life. But Filarete had never seen the art whose imitation he desired. This he had to do in order to fulfil his dream. In 1465 Filelfo recommends him to a friend in Constantinople. 7 Then we hear nothing. Filarete like Winckelmann vanishes from history before he could visit the monuments of that Greek culture whose praises he had sung. 3 P.
