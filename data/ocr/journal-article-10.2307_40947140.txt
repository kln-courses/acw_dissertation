<plain_text><page sequence="1">Introduction: The Art of American Industry Betsy Fahlman The four scholarly articles published in this issue of Indus- trial Archeology consider a broad range of works by Amer- ican artists in the media of printmaking, painting, and sculpture and explore significant aspects of our industrial heritage from the middle years of the 19th century to the end of the Depression. Chronologically, the articles span a muscular century of vigorous technological development and comprise, in microcosm, an art history of American industry. This theme represents my long-standing scholarly interest in the intriguing relationship between art and industry. These essays were inspired by two sessions at the SIA Duluth conference in 2000, where two of these papers were first presented (da Costa Nunes and Schmers). They are complemented by two other essays, invited especially for this issue (Langa, Kierstead), which is the second devoted substantially to this subject. In 1986, 1 guest-edited a special issue of /A, based on papers presented at the 1985 Newark conference, and my column "Industrial Archeol- ogy in Art" has appeared regularly in S IAN. The visual arts represent an invaluable documentary and interpretive resource for the industrial archaeologist. The core identity of SIA has long been the meticulous docu- mentation typical of HABS and HAER reports. The careful scholarship of primary research and detailed measured drawings undertaken by these agencies has not only amassed an impressive body of factual information, but it has also made emphatically clear the vast extent and histor- ical importance of a heritage that is fundamental to our national cultural and economic identity. Further, it has served as the foundation of a broad advocacy for the preservation and the interpretation of the significant places and objects of our technological and industrial past. However, what is standard for an archaeological report is not necessarily typical of artistic practice. Solidly grounded in the fields of archaeology and history, indus- trial archaeology is by nature broadly interdisciplinary. The visual arts can powerfully convey what artists and, by extension, the larger culture of which they were a part thought about places, machines, and process. Works of art have much to tell the industrial archaeologist regarding the interpretation of site and artifact. But in intersecting with the field of art history, traditional IA scholars need to consider the concept that fact is not always "truth" and that details of function and the interpre- tation of meaning are often divergent bodies of informa- tion. Like the artists who depicted industrial sites and processes, the general public was and is less aware of the specific functions and structures that are depicted. The visual impact and cultural context of individual machines and how they worked can be as significant as a detailed catalog of their parts. One of the most assiduous chroniclers of industry is Amer- ican printmaker Joseph Pennell (1857-1926). Although he took a broadly international view of the subject - only half of the images reproduced in his 1916 book, Pictures of the Wonder of Work are from the United States - he emphati- cally asserted that "it is to America that we must turn" for "the modern rendering of work."1 His themes embrace construction sites, oil wells and refineries, smelters, mines, docks, flour mills, inclines, harbors, pottery kilns, cranes, slag heaps, and railroads. He was inspired by the immense scale characteristic of such sites as well as by the noise, smoke, and activity associated with them. Pennell's images comprise a visual thesaurus of industry, and the subjects recorded in his drawings and prints remain places eagerly visited by SIA members. Typical of the sort of scene that captured Pennell's imagi- nation was Coal Breakers, Shenandoah (figure 1), in which, in a quasi-Biblical rendition, he recorded "the long lines of crosses that are trolley poles - the huge castle a coal breaker."2 This veritable work castle might have been an unusual landscape element for ordinary artists but was a common sight in the anthracite region, as Jadviga da Costa Nunes shows. To Pennell's eye, these structures were as impressive to a modern viewer as the Gothic cathedrals of France, which he also admired. Turning his attention to Europe, he found Schneider's Works at Le Creusot (figure 2) a "volcano of work," and the blast furnaces "its crater." Sublimely impressed by its "seething depths," Pennell gave to it an anthropomorphic quality: "it pants, it roars, and then explodes in fire and fume." The subjective romanticism of such a description is not the language of the objectively and academically 5</page><page sequence="2">Industrial Archeology Volume 28, Number 1, 2002 Figure 1 .

The Great Depression began a decade and a half after Pen- nell recorded his admiring visions, and the 1930s were fraught with economic and social distress, played out against a backdrop of labor unrest and union activities. The image presented of industry is, not surprisingly, often neg- ative, driven by hard experience. In art, unemployed work- ers and their families became a prominent motif in indus- trial scenes. The many printmakers who worked during this period recorded the conditions they saw around them, the black and white of their medium (though some experi- mented with color) graphically conveying their strong opinions and social consciousness. Painters produced can- vases of what is often termed the "American Scene" and worked in the representational modes characteristic of the Regionalist style. They recorded a broad range of scenes relating to industrial archaeology that were common emblems of contemporary life, especially for printmakers. Coal Town by Barbara Burrage (figure 3) conveys a hope- less future for the impoverished children she pictures. For them to escape the feudal poverty characteristic of a com- pany town will be extraordinarily difficult. While the iconic miner was inevitably male, the tragedy of hunger, poverty, and poor health is most graphically inscribed on the fate of the women and children who were their partners. Figure 3.

That such a small return stood between them and complete ruin conveys the slender margin on which residents of such towns lived. Her image gains in resonance by its evocation of The Gleaners (1857, Louvre) by French painter Jean- Fran√ßois Millet. Both convey the repetitive cycle of poverty, whether the protagonists be 19th-century peasants or 20th- century mining families. Lowengrund's figures are dwarfed by the landscape in which they labor, in contrast to the powerful women pictured in Michael Gallagher's prints. Mining is a central theme of these essays, either in the form of coal or exemplified by the symbolic allegory of Vulcan's Progressive Era transformation of the earth's minerals into objects of use through the agency of modern industry. By the 1930s the mythic quality of the search by lone miners for untold riches typical of the Gold Rush era had vanished. Mining was now a vast, corporate enterprise, and its mas- sive alteration of the landscape offered dramatic scenes for the artist. The process of extracting ore evokes something elemental, especially when aligned with the mighty facto- ries that process minerals for industrial and practical use. Operations in the West were conducted on an immense scale, and distance from the urban centers of the East made them more susceptible to romantic treatment. As one of the iconic American copper mining sites, Butte, Montana, attracted Pennell's attention, and he enthusiastically described it as "the most pictorial place in America"3 (fig- ure 5). Visiting the smelter at nearby Anaconda, he discov- ered a virtual volcano, an incredible "endless, rolling, Figure 4. Margaret Lowengrund, Coal Pickers, c. 1936, softground etching, 10 X 13 V% in.

Jadviga M. da Costa Nunes has charted a broad overview of images depicting anthracite mining and miners in Penn- sylvania, giving a valuable introduction to how the extrac- tion of coal and its impact on workers was pictured by artists. She traces this theme from the bucolic "machine in the garden" of the 19th-century landscape painters, through the romantic realism of the artists known as "The Eight," to the gritty conditions of the 1930s. Her essay sets the stage for the more specific focus of the essay by Eric J. Schruers who explores a fascinating episode of the intersection of painting, printmaking, litera- ture, and the popular press as visually depicted by John Willard Raught and Corwin Knapp Linson and written about by Stephen Crane. Helen Langa's article, which is focused on Depression-era prints, also considers images of coal mining as well as dra- matic depictions of the mighty blast furnaces of the steel industry. Her essay links social history and visual culture with that of modern industry. 9</page><page sequence="6">Industrial Archeology Volume 28, Number 1, 2002 Birmingham is indelibly identified with the steel industry, and Matthew A. Kierstead discusses the sculptural colossus that has served as the mutable symbol of that Alabama city. Vulcan, drawing on a long mythic and allegorical history, proved a powerful emblem whose meaning was trans- formed depending on physical context. Collectively these essays deepen our understanding of American industry as seen through the lens of the visual arts. Such a broad cultural consideration provides critical texture to archaeological reports and functional descrip- tions. American artists responded deeply to the industrial- ized landscape, and the images they created provide a reso- nant counterpoint for the industrial archaeologist. Notes 1.
