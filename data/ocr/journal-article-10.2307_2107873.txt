BROCKAUS The Landon School Grafted onto the beginning of Plato's Republic is a short dialogue, rather different in texture from the rest of the work, in which Socrates engages in a discussion of the question "What is justice?" Chief among the participants is Thracymachus, who advances the thesis that justice is that which lies in the interests of the strongest. Thracymachus' claim is ambiguous, but subse- quent discussion clarifies that he intended to say that whatever the strongest believe or say is in their interest is just; their believing it to be so makes it so, much in the manner that the umpire saying "You're out" makes you out. Thus Thracymachus sets forth the anthropocentric position that justice is relative to the wants or beliefs of human beings, or some subclass of human beings. The position which Thracymachus defends is not idiosyncratic (indeed, Glaucon presents a parallel if less robust view later in The Republic), repre- senting a vigorous Mtrain in Hellenistic thought, centered philosophically on the Sophists. These fifth and early fourth century BC thinkers-Protagoras, Hippias of Elia, Prodicus and the real-life Thracymachus-taught the art of eristic rhetoric while holding anthropocentric, relativistic positions con- cerning knowledge and reality. In particular, they denied objectivity to the common distinctions between valid as opposed to merely convincing argu- ments, knowledge and mere belief, reality and appearance, and the good and what is desired. A good deal of Plato's philosophical energies are directed towards dis- crediting the Sophists, whom he characteristically portrays in exceptionally unattractive terms. They possess, he argues, "a sort of reputed and apparent knowledge of all subjects, but not in reality." (Sophist 233c) Parallel to Plato's arguments run those of a long line of thinkers, beginning with Aristotle and Aquinas, each of whom embraces some form of realism.'

The Platonic characterization and subsequent vilification of Sophism is of course not wholly even-handed. Significantly, Sophism embodies a recur- ring theme in western thought, periodically reappearing in guise conforming to the dominant intellectual strains of a particular era. In this essay I shall be centrally concerned with a form of relativism which dominated certain influential schools of philosophy in the 19th century, and which finds one embodiment in pychologism,2 which is roughly the thesis that the meanings of words are mental entities. My attention will be directed towards the nar- rower claims of logical psychologism, the thesis that the principles of logic are very general empirical hypotheses about the operations of the human mind. Psychologism is today unfamiliar, at least in the form in which it was then current, but the issues of which it treats are absolutely central in Western philosophy. Yet the historical center of the great battles between psychologistic and realistic logicians is so far removed from the realm of the familiar, that we must regenerate the philosophical weight of such de- bates.3 To logical psychologism I will contrast an analogously narrowed ver- sion of realism, claiming that logical laws describe objective, necessary con- nections between abstract entities. Such realism carries with it some far- reaching consequences. Since logic seems to represent the pure core, as it were, of all representation, we are inexorably drawn towards a realistic analysis of all language and thought.4 The object of language or thought cannot then be a mental picture or image, but must be seen as something ob- jective, mind-independent. Such a broader realism solves a number of prob- lems concerning meaning and truth, but generates its share of new difficulties. 2 For a brief but broader discussion of psychologist, see Nicola Abbanano's article "Psychologism" in P. Edwards ed., The Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Macmillan, New York, 1967), vol. 6, pp. 520-21. For instance, the term 'psychologism' does not appear in the index of Kneale and Kneale's monumental The Development of Logic (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1962), nor in Quine's The Philosophy of Logic (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1986). In contrast, Robert Adamson's A Short History of Logic (Blackwell and Sons, Edinburgh and London, 191 1), a reprint of articles from the 9th (1882) edition of the Encyclopedia Brittanica, is filled with discussions of both the historical roots and then-current manifestations of psychologism. 4 See Kant's argument in Critique of Pure Reason, trans.

BROCKHAUS</page><page sequence="3">I will concentrate mainly on the psychologism of J. S. Mill and George Boole, mentioning other thinkers-Husserl or Sigwart-only occasionally. I will then present Frege's reaction to psychologism, outline the realistic theory which results from his considerations, and subsequently widen the focus to examine the more comprehensive realism of Russell and Moore, which seems a natural consequence of logical realism. I. The Historical and Philosophical Grounds of Psychologism Of all things, the measure is man: of existing things, that they exist; of nonexisting things, that they do not exist. -Protagoras The term psychologistm' first appeared in Germany in the first half of the nineteenth century, applied to the anti-Hegelian positions of Fries and Beneke. The term is ambiguous, allowing of stronger and weaker interpreta- tions, and often a single author will equivocate between the importantly different senses. Weak psychologism claims that logical principles are in- herent in the laws of mind, and uncoverable by psychological methods, the stronger version that logic is literally a branch of psychology.6 In what follows I will restrict my comments to strong psychologism. The starting- point of either sort of psychologistic argument is usually the same; philos- ophy must be based wholly on psychology, since the only data available to us is that gained through self-examination. But psychologism has much deeper roots in two rather different philosophical movements. On one hand, German psychologism results, in part at least, from a corruption of the Kantian Critical Philosophy; for instance, Christoph Sigwart represents his psychologistic Logic as Kantian and Critical.7 On the other, psychologism found fertile soil in the antipathy towards abstract entities central to British Empiricism. Psychologism thus serves as a sort of nexus between the 5 Unfortunately, lack of space forces me to only occasionally bring into play Husserl's considerable contributions to the demise of psychologist, and also to ignore the vigorous tradition of American Realism. Husserl's comprehensive critique of psychologism is contained in the "Prologomena to Pure Logic," which constitutes volume I of his Logical Investigations, trans. J. N. Findlay (Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1970) (hereafter abbreviated 'LI'). For a brief introduction to the American Realists, see E. B. Holt et al., "Introduction to the New Realism," in R. M.

REALISM AND PSYCHOLOGISM IN 19TH CENTURY LOGIC 495</page><page sequence="4">empiricists and at least one central strain of neo-Kantianism. Let us trace the outlines of its development. Logic, Kant claims, can be characterized as "the science of the rules of the understanding in general" (CPR, p. 93). Within logic we can distinguish general from special logic, the former comprising "the absolutely necessary rules of thought without which there can be no employment whatsoever of the understanding" (ibid.), while the latter involves application of logic to particular subjects. General logic is called applied, when it is directed to the rules of the employment of the understanding under the subjective empirical conditions dealt with by psychology. Applied logic has therefore empirical principles... .Consequently it is neither a canon of the understand- ing, nor an organon of the special sciences, but merely a cathartic of the common understanding. As pure logic, [logic] has nothing to do with empirical principles, and does not, as some- times has been supposed, borrow anything from psycholqgy...8 Pure general logic thus abstracts from all contents of knowledge and is wholly a priori, dealing only with the formal conditions of thought. There is, however, for Kant another sort of pure or a priori logic, which prior to his "Copernican Revolution in Philosophy" had escaped notice. Our concept of an object in general has two components, one empirical and a posterior, the other pure and a priori.9 Given this a priori element, there emerges the possibility of a logic which is simultaneously a priori, and thus universal and necessary, yet which still (since it deals with objects) retains some con- tent. Kant calls this Transcendental Logic: it might be termed the logic of the pure object. Now Transcendental Logic, like Transcendental Aesthetic-the a priori study of space and time-represents conditions which, although they apply to every possible object of human experience (although only to such appear- ances, not to things in themselves), have their ground in the transcendental constitution of the mind of any discursive intelligence. They are therefore not "subjective" in the sense of being idiosyncratic to human minds. However, if we allow the distinction between appearances and things in themselves to collapse, transcendental logic becomes increasingly subjec- tive, merely a set of very general psychological laws. Post-Kantian psychol- ogism thus arises from a misunderstanding of the role of objectivity in the Critical Philosophy. This slip is particularly easy for a philosopher like Schopenhauer, who adheres to the Lockian view that all concepts arise from 8 Ibid., p. 94-95, my emphasis. Compare with Husserl, LU I, pp. 214-15. 9 Compare with Descartes' "ball of wax experiment" in Haldane and Ross ed., The Philosophical Works of Descartes (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1911), vol. I, pp. 154-55, and Hume, op. cit., I/ivf2. 496 RICHARD R. BROCKHAUS</page><page sequence="5">experience, and who generally tends to conflate the phenomenal with the il- lusory. Perhaps it is a natural misinterpretation of Kant. Frege writes: It is because Kant associated [both subjective and objective] meanings with the word ['idea', 'Vorstellung'] that his doctrine assumed such a very subjective, idealist complexion, and his true view was made so hard to discover. The distinction here drawn (between concept and ideal stands or falls with that between psychology and logic.1l This tendency to conflate subjective and transcendental senses of words like 'Vorstellung', and the subsequent psychologization of logic, was given fur- ther impetus by the "scientism" of the 19th century. Leszek Kolakowski writes: In giving up the tradition of German Idealism, philosophy gives up its independence from the sciences. It started regarding itself either as a synthesis of the sciences or as a psychological analysis. Even the new variants of Kantianism shifted to the psychological standpoint, and ex- plained the Kantian a priori not as a set of transcendental conditions on knowledge (valid for any rational being) but as specific qualities of the human psyche, and this led fatefully to generic relativism.11 The increase of philosophical interest in the science of man, pioneered a cen- tury earlier by Hume, was reinforced by the rapid progress of the generic sciences-biology, psychology, anthropology-which constantly empha- sized the relativity of their data. Again Kolakowski's words are apt: On [the view of the 19th century German empiricists] the questions of Descartes, Locke and Kant turned out to be wrongly formulated. Cognitive activity was supposed to reveal its real, biologically determined sense. Cognition is a certain kind of behavior in the human organism, and its function is restoring the equilibrium that is constantly disturbed by stimuli from the environment. The predicates "True" and "False" are not found in experience....They belong to the human interpretation of experience. (op. cit., p. 156) Certain much more general social factors also lent credibility to such ar- guments.12 But although the prevailing intellectual currents offered a cri- tique of absolutism somewhat equivocal support, even for liberals the ensu- ing relativity must have been giddy and unnerving. Challenging as they did the purportedly absolute foundations of society, liberals were led to ask: If the laws of man and society, morality and politics were not grounded in immutable divine law, then where do they find such a ground? One terrifying 10 G. Frege, The Foundations of Arithmetic, trans. J. L.

More comforting by far is the view that moral and social principles are based on certain general principles of human nature. Thus Adam Smith promotes laissez-faire capitalism by extolling its premises as a true estima- tion of the most general features of human nature, and the Benthamites pre- sent a view analyzing morality in terms of human wants, desires and feel- ings. Urged on by higher biblical criticism, even theology attempted to pro- vide itself with a scientific basis; Paley's Natural Theology, for instance, is very much in the temper of the times, with its emphasis on the natural evi- dence for religious claims."3 Further impetus was supplied by the physical sciences; in the field of music, that sacred preserve of the human spirit, Helmholtz showed such supposedly "subjective" phenomena as timbre, harmonics, etc., to be analyzable in terms of physiological reactions to wave motions. Summarizing the effect of the overwhelming trend towards grounding the fundamental principles of society and intellectual inquiry not in philosophy but in the special sciences, John Passmore writes: There was some dispute, acrimonious at times, as to whether psychology, or biology, or an- thropology should be proclaimed "The Queen of the Sciences"; but any metaphysics which laid claim to the title was at once howled down as the Old Pretender.14 In light of the inevitable methodological and societal chaos, it is not in- significant to our examination of Mill's logical theories that prior to A System of Logic the greater part of his energies had been expended in at- tempting to find a via media between absolutism and sceptical relativism, perhaps best expressed in his essays on Bentham and Coleridge.15 Ironically, although psychologism styles itself as providing logic with an objective foundation, it introduces precisely the anthropomorphic relativism which Frege, Russell, Husserl and Wittgenstein were to hold in contempt. If the general intellectual atmosphere of the 19th century proved fertile soil for the seeds of logical psychologism, that thesis also found the techni- cal philosophy of the day congenial. The movement to ground logic in the science of human nature was aided and abetted by a concurrent rebellion against the Aristotelianism of the Schoolmen, the immediate influence being a general antipathy towards formal logic. The two tendencies-psychologi- cal theories of inference and a neglect of formal logic-had been bedfellows 13 Cf.

Compare with Husserl's discussion of Mach and Avenarius, LI I, pp. 197 ff. 15 J. S. Mill, Bentham and Coleridge, ed. Leavis (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1978).

BROCKHAUS</page><page sequence="7">in the British tradition since Locke. Following a discussion in the Essay of the forces which bring- about varying degrees of assent, Locke observes: If we will observe the actings of our own minds, we shall find that we reason the best and clearest, when we only observe the connexion of the proof, without reducing our thoughts to any rule of syllogism. And therefore we may take notice, that there are a great many men who reason exceedingly clear and right, who know not how to make a syllogism....If syllogisms must be taken for the only proper instrument of reason and means of knowledge, it would fol- low that, before Aristotle, there was not one man that did or could know anything by reason and that, since the invention of the syllogisms, there is not one of ten thousand that doth.16 Locke asks: If the syllogism is the vehicle of knowledge, must not men rea- son syllogistically when they reason well? And since that seems not to be the case, what is the real vehicle? Locke's answer is very Protestant; let us observe what each man does in the course of ordinary reasoning. Logic thus becomes an empirical science, where we discover the laws of reason in the same manner that we discover the laws of the planets, viz. observation and hypothesis. If Locke presents us with a pot pourri of anecdote and ad hominem argu- ment, Hume strikes at the very heart of the Aristotelian conception of logic. All sciences, he argues, depend upon the "science of man." Why is this? Hume holds that all reasoning consists in comparing two given things to see what relations hold between them. However, in Treatise I/iii/3 he argues persuasively that of the seven "philosophical relations," only cause and ef- fect allows us to move from a present perception to one not present; only causal reasoning leads beyond the circle of what is immediately present to us, and supports inference. But in I/iii Hume asks, What is the ground of our propensity to make causal judgments? Is the ground rational? The causal principle which underlies such judgments is neither "intuitive" (self-evi- dent) nor "demonstrable" (deducible from self-evident premises). Is it then empirical? No finite series of observations could establish the causal princi- ple. Stuck in his efforts to find a rational ground, Hume suggests in lieu of further search that we look carefully at what happens in the case of a partic- ular causal judgment. But by the middle of I/iii, this examination has ef- fected a sea-change in Hume's argument. Rather than seeking the grounds for a belief in causes, he embarks upon a long and sophisticated analysis of the causes of belief. By the end of I/iii Hume believes that he has put to rest as empty the distinction, dear to the Cartesian tradition, between the causes of and grounds for a belief. Thus logic becomes an investigation of the factors that cause beliefs to be formed and reinforced-an empirical investigation into the principles of the mind which bring about association and thus infer- ence. 16 Locke, Essay Concerning Human Understanding (Dover, New York, 1959), p. 390. REALISM AND PSYCHOLOGISM IN 19TH CENTuRY LOGIC 499</page><page sequence="8">The consequences of this argument are far-reaching. Take for example the question, so central to the Meditations, Does body exist? We may strive to answer this question and others like it, Hume argues, but the fundamental fact is that we have no choice whether to believe in body, or analogously to make causal judgments. We are constituted to thinking in such a manner. Logic thus loses much of its normative element, as the "art" of correct thinking, and becomes rather the endpoint of an investigation into the man- ner and extent in which thought-processes are conditioned.17 It becomes an investigation of the "laws of thought." There is a final aspect of psychologism, quite apart from the considera- tions examined so far, which makes it a comfortable and attractive position. Consider the question, Could there be a logic different from ours? Not merely one which was couched in a different formalism, but a logic which did not (for instance) countenance the Law of Excluded Middle, or the Principle of Contradiction? Various forms of conventionalism admit this possibility, since logic results from certain decisions on our part, while the realist, treating logical principles as representatives of the necessary struc- ture of the world, would hold the suggestion to be incoherent. But each is faced with serious difficulties. The conventionalist cannot tell us what cri- terion of possibility he uses to say that other logics are possible, while the realist must demonstrate the alleged "necessity" of logic. Psychologism presents a convenient way out. By grounding logic in the nature of the mind and thus explaining why we cannot conceive of different logics, it frees us from the task of showing that certain structures in the world are necessary.18 II. Psychologism in Logic and Mathematics. Logic is not a science, separate from and coordinate to psy- chology. To the extent that it is a science at all, it is a part or branch of psychology, distinguished from it on one hand as the part is from the whole, and on the other hand as the art is from the science. -Mill Logic is the physics of thinking or it is nothing at all. -Lipps 17 This is slightly misleading, since flume retains a vestige of this normative element. Contrast the "philosophical" probabilities of I/iii/12 with the "unphilosophical probabilities" of I/iii/13, which, although derivedd from the same principles...have not had the good fortune to obtain the same sanction" (p. 143). Thus the pragmatic rules of Iiii/15, of which Hume writes "Here is all the Logic I think proper to employ in my reasoning..." (p. 175) are apparently justified only on pragmatic or historical grounds. 1 For a discussion of this argument, see Mohanty, op. cit., pp. 26-27. 500 RICHARD R. BROCKHAUS</page><page sequence="9">We must now look more closely at the content of psychologism. It is im- portant to keep in mind that psychologism is a theory of the nature of logic, not a method for judging the validity or invalidity of a given inference. Its realm is not logic proper but the philosophy of logic. At the beginning of The Laws of Thought, Boole offers the following characterization of his treatise: [This work] is designed, in the first place, to investigate the fundamental laws of those op- erations of the mind by which reasoning is performed. It is unnecessary here to enter into any argument to prove that the operations of the mind are in a real sense subject to laws, and that a science of mind is possible.19 In a parallel passage in A System of Logic, Mill approvingly quotes Bishop Whately's Elements of Logic (1826): Logic [is] the science, as well as the art, of reasoning; meaning by the former term, the anal- ysis of the mental process which takes place whenever we reason, and the latter, the rules, grounded on that analysis, for conducting the process correctly....A right understanding of the mental process itself, of the conditions upon which it depends, and the steps of which it con- sists, is the only basis on which a system of logicall rules...can be founded.20 What is logic then about? What is its subject-matter? Mill's answer is sim- ple and direct: Existence, so far as Logic is concerned with it, has reference only to phenomena; to actual, or possible, states of external or internal consciousness. Feelings of sensitive beings, or the possi- bilities of having those feelings, are the only things the existence of which can be a subject of logical induction. (Ibid., II, pp. 133-34.) Since logic deals solely with relations among feelings or sensations or, more broadly, mental states, the science upon which it is grounded will be psy- chology, which has as its subject-matter: (Tihe uniformities of successions, the laws, whether ultimate or demonstrable, according to which one mental state succeeds another, it is caused by, or at least is caused to follow, another. (Ibid., II, p. 243). Husserl quotes a striking parallel passage by the German psychologistic lo- gician Heymans: Just as the chemical formula 2H2 + 02 = 2 H20 expresses the general fact that, in suitable circumstances, two volumes of Hydrogen combine with one volume of Oxygen to form two volumes of water, so (Heymans cites a Boolian syllogistic form] merely represents the fact 19 Boole, op. cit., p. 3. Ironically, it was Boole's work which made it possible to consider logic without psychology. Cf. Kneale and Kneale, p. 407. REALISM AND PSYCHOLOGISM IN 19TH CENTURY LOGIC 501</page><page sequence="10">that, in suitable circumstances, two universal affirmative judgments with a common subject, produce two new particular judgments in consciousness....Why in this case two new judgments are produced [but not in other cases] we are at present ignorant.21 Kolakowski offers a general characterization of the position inherent in these passages: The consequences of thought, then, are not logical consequences of thought but causal rela- tions between the facts of consciousness. To say that the sentence "all dogs are mammals" en- tails the sentence "some dogs are mammals" does not really mean that anything logically fol- lows anything. It simply displays a causal relation between two acts of acceptance related to those two judgments. Some mysterious natural laws connect these two acts in a causal succes- sion of events. Thus, logical rules are relative, if not to individuals, at least to the human species. Thus nothing prevents us from supposing that they have no universal validity, and they might lose it for another sentient being; perhaps they might lose it for us if evolution changes some mechanism in the nervous system. Perhaps there is a world where rational beings think ac- cording to the principle "if p, then not-p."22 If logic is thus not "about" relations between abstract objects, is it then free of any metaphysical commitment? Mill argues that the psychologistic characterization of logic both is and isn't a product of any metaphysical pre- suppositions. On one hand, he is clear that it avoids commitment to abstract entities as the referents of logical terms, and thus has the ontological effect of shifting commitment from abstract objects to minds, which are presum- ably the locus of the psychological laws in question. Yet on the other hand, the characterizations of psychology and thus logic are independent, he claims, of any particular theory of the nature of mind, including his phe- nomenalism; "What the Mind is, as well as what Matter is, or any other questions respecting things in themselves,...it would be foreign to the pur- poses of this treatise to consider." (Ibid., II, p. 420) Analogously, Boole be- lieves that far from depending upon some particular theory of mind, logic provides information which may allow us to choose among competing theo- ries. (Ibid., p. 24) Since both Mill and Boole apparently hold that the truth of psycholo- gism to be nothing short of obvious, why did logicians ever strike upon any other theory? Mill provides an answer, not surprisingly reminiscent of Berkeley's attack on abstract ideas. The argument appears in his discussion of the Aristotelian dictum de omni et nullo-whatever can be truly predicated of a class can be truly predicated of each member of that class. If those of us 20 J. S. Mill, A System of Logic (John Parker, London,1851) vol. I, p. 2; the emphasis is mine. Compare with Mill's definition of psychology in vol. II, p. 243 (hereafter, 'SoL'). 21 Husserl, LI I, pp. 131-32. 22 Op. cit., p. 18. Kolakowski obviously intends the last expression to represent something stronger than material implication, since "p v -p" reduces to "-p V -p," which is not particularly puzzling. 502 RICHARD R. BROCKHAUS</page><page sequence="11">not awakened to Mill's nominalism think of a class intensionally, then the dictum appears to make a claim about some relation between Man- "Something inherent in men and vastly superior to them in dignity," as Mill puts it-and individual men like John Stuart Mill, George Boole, Gregor Princip, Gregor Samsa and so forth. However, "when it is known that a class, a universal, a genus, a species, is not an entity per se, but neither more nor less than the individual substances themselves which are placed in a class," the proposition loses its aura of startling metaphysical importance, becoming "identical" or tautologous. Of previous logicians, Mill writes: Once accustomed to consider scientific investigation as essentially the study of universals, men did not drop this habit of thought when they ceased to regard universals as possessing an independent existence ....23 Thus the dictum strikes us as important insofar, as we do not see that it hides the presupposition that universals have independent existence. Once this pre- supposition is exposed, we immediately see that the path to the ground of logic lies not outward but inward, in the laws of the human mind which lie behind thought and language. In a similar vein Boole asks: What is the logical import of the processes [involved in symbolic reasoning]? Analogies, Mathematical and otherwise, cast aside, what doctrines of intellectual activity remain con- cealed beneath the forms themselves?24 His answer likewise emphasizes an inward turn. This can be seen not only from the title of Chapter II of The Laws of Thought-"Derivation of the laws of the symbols of logic from the laws of the operations of the human mind,"-but from such plentiful passages as "When mental concepts and mental operations are expressed in signs, the laws of those concepts and op- erations become the laws of the signs." (Ibid., p. 232) Thus logic is no more than an outward representation of the psychological law of mental opera- tions. What sorts of psychological laws do Mill and Boole have in mind? What are the candidates for the mental reality which lies behind the symbolic op- erations? Boole withholds judgment, but Mill offers a number of rather simple generalizations about minds, reminiscent of Bk. I of the Treatise. One example of a "law of mind" (which Mill attributes to Hume) is "Whenever any state of consciousness has once been incited in us..., an infe- rior degree of the same state of consciousness..., resembling the former but inferior in intensity, is capable of being reproduced in us..." (SoL, p. 423) 23 Ibid., p. 198. Compare with Berkeley, Principles of Human Knowledge (Bobbs-Merrill, Indianapolis, Indiana, 1957), introduction and passim. 24 G. Boole, Studies in Logic and Probability (Watts and Co., London, 1952), p. 212. REALISM AND PSYCHOLOGISM IN 19TH CENTURY LOGIC 503</page><page sequence="12">That is, impressions produce correlative ideas, which differ from the impres- sion only in "strength and vivacity." Another "law" is the principle of as- sociation, which Mill inherits from his father's Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind, but which likewise can be traced to the Treatise. A sort of "mental gravity" holds between ideas and impressions: 'These ideas, or secondary mental states, are excited by our impressions, or by other ideas, ac- cording to certain laws which are called Laws of Association." (Ibid., p. 424) The willingness of Mill (and Boole) to ground the ancient doctrines of logic on such a paltry psychological basis is an indication of how certain they are that some view like this must be true. Mill's antipathy toward abstract objects in logic anticipates a parallel hostility towards realism in mathematics, resulting in an empiricist theory of mathematical truth which is a traditional bedfellow for psychologistic logic. Mill's analysis of mathematics appears in two places in A System of Logic: the general nature of mathematics is discussed in Volume Il-geome- try in 11/5, arithmetic in 11/6-while an equally important discussion ap- pears in 111/26. In these latter passages, he considers and rejects two popular (British) views of the nature of mathematics, one traceable to Locke, the other to Berkeley. Locke held the truths of mathematics to be merely ver- bal; they represent nothing more than certain conventions concerning the usage of words like 'straight line', 'three', and so forth.25 But Mill contends (quite rightly) that such a view cannot account for the synthetic use of mathematics (e.g., counting my change), as well as being so wildly at vari- ance with common sense that "a person must have made some advances in philosophy to believe it." (SoL I, p. 279) We cannot, on the other hand, ac- cept the Berkelian thesis that mathematical truths are merely about ideas.26 Mill offers as counter-examples such geometric concepts as lines without width, points and so forth; if ideas are mental images, we clearly cannot have a mental picture of a line without width.27 Geometry cannot be (solely) about ideas, then, and analogous arguments hold for arithmetic. Thus, mathematical propositions cannot be construed either as propositions about the meanings of words, or propositions about our ideas. What then is the nature of a mathematical truth? Mill sometimes distin- guishes and sometimes conflates two different questions; For what do math- ematical concepts like "point" and "three" stand? and What is the ground of mathematical principles such as the law of the transitivity of identity? With respect to the first question, Mill will hold that numbers refer to common properties of things, to the second, that mathematical principles are 25 Locke, op. ciL, I, pp. 270-75, II 251-66. 2 Berkeley, op. cit., sect. 12-14, 118-34. 27 Op. cit., I, pp. 279-80. Compare with Treatise., I/ii/1-5. Note the continued assumption that ideas are at bottom mental pictures. 504 RICHARD R. BROCKHAUS</page><page sequence="13">the result of inductions from experience, and thus are neither necessary nor certain. Mill's support of the first claim is based almost wholly on his nominal- ism. All numbers must be numbers of something: "There are no such things as numbers in the abstract. Ten must mean ten bodies, or ten sounds, or ten beatings of the pulse." (op. cit., II, p. 280) However, through some un- specified mental process, we give numbers the property of complete general- ity; "But though numbers must be numbers of something, they can be num- bers of anything." (Ibid.) To say that two plus two equals four is to say that two dogs plus two dogs yields four dogs, two pebbles and two pebbles, four pebbles, and so forth indifferently. With respect to the nature of mathematical principles, Mill contends that the acquisition of number-concepts leads to the discovery of certain em- pirical relations between the collections of things for which those number- concepts stand. For example, we recognize that the two collections XX and XXX can be rearranged to yield XXXXX, and that the angle opposite the greatest side of a triangle is always the largest angle. Note that each of these principles is based on induction from a finite string of experiences and thus contingent. We cannot say, then, that what holds for pebbles and dogs must hold for guinea pigs; "The character of necessity, ascribed to the truths of mathematics, and even ... the peculiar certainty ascribed to them, is an illu- sion." (SoL, p. 25) In summary, the principles of logic represent nothing more than very general psychological laws governing the operations of the human mind. They are therefore contingent, empirical, anthropocentric and historical. Their apparent universal validity is based wholly on the ubiquitousness of the principles of psychology which they represent. Mathematics likewise does not represent necessary truths about relations between abstract enti- ties, but rather contingent empirical principles concerning common proper- ties of groups of concrete entities. An immediate consequence-not unwel- come to Mill-of the loss of certainty and necessity in mathematics is that ethical reasoning no longer suffers by comparison. One problem with this view (certainly recognized by Mill and Boole) is that we generally take logic to be normative rather than descriptive. It rep- resents rules which, rather than describing how people (always) actually think, sets up norms or standards for how people ought to think if they wish to maximize truth-transferring connections between premises and conclu- sions. But if logic is general psychology, then what do we mean by bad or il- logical thinking? Compare; if a newly discovered planet "violates" Kepler's first law, then what we took to be a law in fact was not. Yet we do not react in a parallel manner when someone commits the fallacy of denying the an- tecedent. This disanalogy between "laws of mind" and physical laws repre- REALISM AND PSYCHOLOGISM IN 19TH CENTURY LOGIC 505</page><page sequence="14">sents a serious crack in the facade of psychologism, which Frege will be quick to exploit. III. Frege's Critique of Psychologism [Ilt is important to keep in mind that Husserl and Frege belonged to nearly the same philosophical world, in which a sort of neo-Kantian philosophy prevailed..., in which Hermann Lotze was the towering figure, in which what was labeled as "psychologism" was a widely held philosophy of logic, and in which philosophers were concerned with such concepts as mental acts, Inhalt or contents of those acts, and made liberal use of the concept of Vorstellung or presentation. -J. N. Mohanty Husserl and Frege Logic cannot have any empirical part; that is, a part in which the universal and necessary laws of thought should rest on grounds taken from experience; otherwise, it would not be logic, i.e., a canon for the understanding or the reason, valid for all thought, and capable of demonstration. -Kant, Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals Frege's critique of psychologism, his conceptual realism and the subse- quent broad realism of the early Russell and Moore represents one major breaking-point in the history of philosophy. Since Descartes' sweeping cri- tique of the foundations of knowledge in the seventeenth century, the cen- tral preoccupation of western philosophy has been the justification of knowledge-claims. Frege changed this, or at least initiated a change which has gained increasing momentum since his death. Michael Dummett writes: Frege was the first [philosopher]-at least since Plato-to make a sharp separation between [the analysis of meanings] and [the task] of establishing what is true and what are our grounds for accepting it.. 28 ...[Fregel starts from meaning by taking the theory of meaning as the only part of philoso- phy whose results do not depend upon those of any other part, but which underlie all the rest. By doing this, he effected a revolution in philosophy as great as the similar revolution effected by Descartes...29 These claims may seem overblown to those contemporary philosophers who see Frege mostly as a philosopher of mathematics and an innovator in sym- 28 Michael Dummett, Frege: The Philosophy of Language (Harper and Row, New York, 1973), p. 667. 29 Ibid., p. 669. 'Theory of meaning' for Frege thus takes the position occupied for Husserl by his "new science" of phenomenology. 506 IUCHARD R. BROCKHAUS</page><page sequence="15">bolic logic, but my purpose is not to evaluate Frege's systematic importance. Rather, I will concentrate on two topics: Frege's realistic theory of mean- ing, and his Platonism in mathematics. These will both look backwards, in reaction to psychologism, and forward to the broader realism of Russell and Moore. Frege's first major publication (in 1879) was a small volume entitled Begriffsschrift-"concept writing" or "ideography"-subtitled "A for- mula language, modeled upon that of arithmetic, for pure thought."30 The immediate purpose of the Begriffsschrift is to provide a language free from the misleading oddities and psychological connotations which mar ordinary language, the wider purpose to combat formalism and empiricism in mathe- matics, and psychologism in logic. Frege considered these two projects as in- timately connected. Its chief technical novelty lies in the introduction of the quantifier notation, marking the beginnings of modem logic with its depen- dence on quantified variables. Far from a smashing success, like Hume's Treatise it appears to have fallen stillborn from the presses; the murmurs it did excite among the zealots were largely negative. Perhaps discouraged by the minimal response to his work, Frege published in 1884 a non-symbolic presentation of the central arguments of the earlier work, entitled The Foundations of Arithmetic,31 which included a careful estimation of the re- lation of his thought to that of his predecessors. It is this work, and to a lesser extent the 1893 work The Basic Laws of Arithmetic32 and the famous paper "On Sense and Reference" with which I will be concerned. The fundamental goals of FA are three: to argue against psychologism in logic and Millian empiricism in mathematics, to show instead that numbers are real extramental existents, and to promote the "logicist thesis" that the principles of mathematics are reducible to those of pure logic. Of these, Frege sees the last as most fundamental: "The present work will make clear that even an inference like that from n to n+1, which on the face of it is pecu- liar to mathematics, is based on the general laws of logic...." (FA, p. iv) Towards this end Frege must entertain certain more pedestrian projects. One is the provision of a clear and unambiguous representation of proofs, for 30 I shall refer to the English translation by Stefan Bauer-Mengelberg, published in J. van Heijenoort ed., Frege and Gbdel: Two Fundamental Texts in Mathematical Logic (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1970). Another translation, with associated shorter papers, is published in G. Frege, Conceptual Notation, ed. T. Byrum (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1972). Of particular interest among the additional materials is the short paper also entitled "Conceptual Notation," pp. 90-100. 31 I shall refer to J. L. Austin's elegant English translation, The Foundations of Arithmetic (Northwestern University Press, Evanston,Illinois, 1974), hereafter abbreviated FA. 32 Edited and partially translated by M. Furth as G. Frege, The Basic Laws of Arithmetic (University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1964), hereafter abbreviated as BLA. REALISM AND PSYCHOLOGISM IN 19TH CENTURY LOGIC 507</page><page sequence="16">which the apparatus of the Begriffsschrift is necessary; "Of course the pro- nouncement is often made that arithmetic is merely a more highly developed logic; yet it remains disputable so long as transitions occur in proofs that are not made according to acknowledged rules of logic, but seem rather based on intuition." (BLA, p. 3) The rigorous proofs made possible by the quantifier notation provide the methodological tools for such a reduction, and although without the actual reductions the logicist thesis remains an unredeemed promissory note, the plausibility of the project can be estab- lished. Thus in FA Frege has claimed no more than to have made the logicist thesis "probable." The second project is the banishment from logic of any psychological element, necessitated insofar as psychological intrusions tend to mask such crucial distinctions as "the characteristic mark of a concept and a property of an object" (BLA, pp. 12-13). But most generally, the failure to rigorously distinguish the logical from the psychological promotes conflation of the two, ultimately leading to psychologist, and Frege be- lieves that psychologism entails precisely what Boole, Mill and others sought to avoid: relativism and scepticism.33 Mill defines number in such a manner that (for instance) the number three exists just insofar as there are collections of three things, and has no existence beyond such collections. Arithmetic propositions such as '7 + 5 = 12' represent mere empirical generalizations about the concrete behavior of such collections; if we put seven cookies in a bag, and add five cookies, care- ful counting turns up 12 cookies. Frege's attack on Mill's analysis takes the form of a reduction ad absurdem, claiming that Mill's views necessitate the rejection of certain commonly held mathematical propositions. Note that Frege takes as a datum the truth of mathematics; like Moore, he does not consider the possibility that mathematics might be rather different than we believe. Let us examine a representative Fregean argument. If number concepts have been empirically garnered, and have no reference beyond the empirical, then I have the concept '5' insofar as I once had a sensory presentation of (say) five geese or a basketball team. But what then is the sensory presenta- tion associated with 777864? Lacking such a sensory presentation, what does it mean to say that a number of smaller numbers, which have the the requi- site sensory presentations, are factors of 777864? If the factors of 777864 are real, must not the number itself be? More generally, from whence comes 3 Here Frege echoes Husserl, who took the search for certainty-that is, avoidance of sceptical relativism-to be a constituting mark of Western civilization, and held that failure to pursue certainty indicates the decay of such a civilization. Cf. Kolakowski, op. cit., pp. 7-8. It is interesting to speculate about the relations between Frege's anti- sceptical realism, his extreme political conservatism and the accident of his birth in the auspicious year 1848. 508 RICHARD R. BROCKHAUS</page><page sequence="17">our certainty that every number has a successor? If we accept a Millian anal- ysis of number, certain fundamental mathematical principles become sus- pect. It is of course open to Mill to argue that experiences with cookie-bags lead to habits, which by projection then move us towards higher numbers. Having empirically verified that 2 + 3 = 5, we then internalize a rule which brings us to believe that 777 + 326 is 1103.34 But if we must fall back on a recursive rule for higher numbers, why not be satisfied with 1 + 1 = 2 as our empirical basis, and leave it at that? Further, if the generation of number- concepts depends on rearranging things to achieve a certain sensory presenta- tion, what would happen, Frege sarcastically queries, in a world where ev- erything was nailed down? Must we must hold a rally of all the blind peo- ple in Germany to give a sense to 'the number of blind Germans'? (cf. FA, p. 30) The evident ad hominem element in the preceding (representative) argu- ments might bring the empiricist to answer (for instance) that things in our world are in fact not nailed down. Since it is not incumbent on the philoso- pher of mathematics to explain how number concepts gain meaning in some possible world a great deal different from ours, such attempts at refutation of Mill's position are simply barking up the wrong tree. Frege's retort, which we will examine soon, is that such objections point to a deeper and more serious problem with Mill's philosophy of arithmetic, namely, mud- dling how we arrive at the content of a concept with how we justify its assertion." But Frege is not yet finished with the empiricist analysis of mathemati- cal concept-formation. If I acquire my concept of 5 by observing cookies, how do I then apply it to collections of five which are logically different from cookies? Yet we do speak of five commands, five kinds of proof, and so forth, and it would (seem miraculous if a property (number) derived from observation of cookies just happened to fit any other sorts of collections we chose. Frege writes: It would indeed be remarkable if a property abstracted from external things could be trans- ferred without any change of sense to events, to ideas, and to concepts. The effect would be just like speaking of fusible events, or blue ideas, or salty concepts, or tough judgment. (FA, p. 31) Further, if our number concepts are empirically acquired, from whence come our concepts of zero and unity? Are there sensory presentations associated with them? (FA sect. 20) Imagine a green field, Frege invites us, and then pic- ture one green field; is there a difference in the presentations? If so, which 34 Compare with Hume, Treatise, 1/iv/2 and JIivfl. 35 Cf. FA section 1, and compare with Husserl, LI I, chap. 5. REALISM AND PSYCHOLOGISM IN 19TH CENTURY LOGIC 509</page><page sequence="18">element of the presentation corresponds to the concept of one?36 Note that such objections deal not with an imaginary world quite different from ours, but with the difficulties of explaining the genesis of certain mathematical concepts in the actual world. But a tack which we might call Frege's key argument provides an even more devastating blow to empiricism in mathematics. Treating number-con- cepts as abstractions from collections of things, as representing nothing more than a common property of those collections pushes all consideration of numerical matters towards an idealistic relativism. Homer's Iliad can be considered as one poem, 24 books, such and such number of chapters, of lines, of words, and so forth. Of the Iliad one can therefore say, with equal justice, "This is one" or "This is 24."37 Mill is right that two books are physically different from one, but two boots are physically identical with one pair of boots. If number is some physical property of a collection, then, it should be immune to change with our interests or attention. But the example of the Iliad gives number a subjective or at least anthropocentric look, quite unlike (say) color or mass. If number is not a physical property of a collection, is it then mental? Since number seems a function of our interests and attention, perhaps it is a property of our idea of such a collection. Are numbers ideas, and mathemat- ical propositions relations between these ideas? Frege quotes Berkeley's support for this position: It ought to be considered that number.. .is nothing fixed and settled, really existing in things themselves. It is entirely the creature of the mind, considering either an idea by itself, or any combination of ideas to which it gives one name. Accordingly the mind variously combines its ideas, the unity varies; and as the unit, so the number, which is only a collection of units, doth vary also. We call a window one, a chimney one, and yet a house in which there are many windows, and many chimneys, hath an equal right to be called one, and many houses go into the making of one city.38 Does a rejection of Millian empiricism then lead to Berkelian idealism? Of course not, Frege retorts; neither numbers themselves, nor the principles of their relations and transactions, are mental in any philosophically important sense. 36 Compare with Hume's arguments on the concept of existence, Treatise, I/iilvi, and Kant's, CPR, pp. 210 ff. 3 FA, sect. 21. An analogous problem concerns "dividing a collection"-we can divide a bundle of straw by untying it, by breaking each straw in half, etc. Cf. FA, sect. 23, and compare with Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, (Macmillan, New York, 1958), #48 ff. 38 Cf. FA, p. 33. The quotation is from Berkeley's A New Theory of Vision (Dutton, New York, 1910), section 109. 510 RICHARD R. BROCKHAUS</page><page sequence="19">If number were an idea, then arithmetic would be psychology. But arithmetic is no more psychology than, say, astronomy is. Astronomy is concerned, not with the ideas of the planets, but with the planets themselves, and by the same token the objects of arithmetic are not ideas either. (FA, p. 37) The botanist gives something just as factual when he gives the Number of the flowers' petals as when he gives their shape. (Ibid., p. 34) This point is of central importance for Frege, and he will aggressively press it far beyond what is needed to refute the psychologistic logician or mathe- matician. The objections viewed so far indicate only that psychologism is contrary to numerous widely held mathematical beliefs. But Frege further contends that at the foundations of psychologism lies a confusion; a natural confu- sion, perhaps, but a confusion nonetheless, between the act of conscious- ness-the judgment-and the object of that judgment. But underlying this confusion is a deep-seated belief about the nature of truth. "Surveying the whole question," Frege writes, "it seems to me that the source of the dis- pute lies in our conception of what is true." (BLA, pp. 15) If we want to emerge from subjectivity at all, we must conceive of knowledge as an activity that does not create what is known but grasps what is already there.. .If I grasp a pencil, many changes take place in my body... But the totality of these changes is neither the pencil nor cre- ates the pencil; the internal changes are not the grasping. In the same way, that which we grasp with the mind exists independently of this activity, independent of the ideas and their alter- ations that are part of this grasping or accompany it, and it is neither identical with the totality of these events nor created by it.... (BLA, pp. 23-24.) A proposition may be thought, and again, it may be true; let us never confuse these two things. We must remind ourselves, it seems, that a proposition no more ceases to be true when I cease to think about it than the sun ceases to exist when I close my eyes. (FA, p. vi) Thus an examination of the nature of truth shows that the psychological lo- gician fails to distinguish clearly enough between the idea, the Vorstellung (always psychological for Frege) which constitutes the vehicle of the men- tal act, and the object of that act of consciousness. But what is the ground of Frege's conviction that the alleged confusion is a confusion? Just as Mill might complain that the certainty which Frege ascribes to mathematical propositions is specious, isn't the whole thrust of the Idealist's arguments that the very distinction between idea and object upon which Frege puts so much weight is phony?39 Frege's retort, the weight of which is difficult to assess, is that if the objects of our judgments were merely ideas, there could then be no common ground between speakers, and 9 For instance, Berkeley's arguments in Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous (Bobbs-Merrill, Indianapolis, Indiana, 1954), Dialogue I. REALISM AND PSYCHOLOGISM IN 19TH CENTURY LOGIC 511</page><page sequence="20">language would be impossible. But without common, objective language, there could be no possibility of conflicting opinions: If we could not grasp anything but what was within our own selves, then a conflict of opin- ions would be impossible, because a common ground would be lacking, and no idea in the psy- chological sense can afford us such a ground. There would be no logic to be appointed arbiter in the conflict of opinions. (BLA, p. 17) Unless we are willing to dismiss putative communication, dispute, etc. as mere illusion, we must accept that at least some of our judgments have ex- tramental and thus potentially public objects; Dummett remarks that for Frege the objective sense of a proposition is guaranteed by the publicness of language. (op. cit., p. 680) Rejection of this objectivity entails an extreme solipsistic scepticism which Frege would no doubt deem sterile. Now we can return to our puzzle about number. Numbers are not proper- ties of physical collections, nor are they mental entities, and thus mathemat- ical propositions are not about physical objects or ideas. What then is the status of numbers? Frege's answer is that every number is a self-subsistent abstract entity, a real constituent of the world. "We are driven to the con- clusion that number is neither spatial nor physical, like Mill's piles of peb- bles or gingersnaps, nor yet subjective like ideas, but non-sensible and objec- tive."(FA, p. 37) Frege praises Cantor: I heartily share [Cantor's] contempt for the view that in principle only finite numbers ought to be admitted as actual. Perceptible by the senses [infinite numbers] are not, nor are they spatial-any more than fractions are, or negative numbers...; and if we restrict the actual to what acts on our senses or at least produces effects which may cause sense-perceptions as near or remote consequences, then naturally no number of any of these kinds is actual. (FA, p. 97) More generally, substituting the word 'actual' for 'perceivable', he writes: For me there is a domain of what is objective distinct from what is actual, whereas the psy- chological logicians without ado take what is not actual to be subjective. And yet, it is quite impossible to understand why something which has a status independent of the judging subject has to be actual, i.e. has to be capable of acting directly or indirectly on the senses. No such con- nection is to be found between the concepts [being objective and being actual] and we can even adduce examples pointing in the opposite direction. (BLA, pp. 15-16) Thus no argument which demands a sensory presentation for number can be effective. A second mistake stems from the nominalistic dogma that concepts are generated only by abstraction from (perceptible) particulars. Concepts, Frege argues, can be just as readily acquired through their defining character- istics as through experience of an example. But more importantly, the mode of acquisition of a concept ought not be confused with the nature of that 512 RICHARD R. BROCKHAUS</page><page sequence="21">concept. Thus empiricist arguments concerning the origin of concepts are ei- ther unsound or irrelevant. - Finally, the acceptance of a realistic theory of numbers is hindered by a failure to understand the importance of a principal constituent of Frege's theory of language; only in the context of a proposition does a word have a meaning. If we ignore this "context principle," we are then tempted to look for some characteristic of an isolated word which makes it a meaningful constituent of a given sentence. But the only likely candidate turns out to be an idea or a sensation or a mental image, which we wrongly identify with the meaning of the word, much as William James identified consciousness with certain feelings in the head and upper chest. What are mathematical propositions about? Frege answers that they are about numbers. But an acceptable theory of arithmetic must not only trace the source of mathematical concepts, but also show the ground of the truth of mathematical principles. For Mill '1 + 2 = 3' represents an empirical generalization, for Boole a particular consequence of the general laws of psychology. What is Frege's view? Frege's solution is a form of logicism; the principles of arithmetic are no more than specific instances of the laws of logic, which are analytic. But Frege's usage of that term must be carefully distinguished from the more familiar Kantian sense. For Kant, analyticity is characterized by "containment" of the predicate in the subject, as in "All bodies are ex- tended." But if mathematical propositions were analytic in this sense (which Kant of course emphatically denies, offering '5 + 7 = 12' as an exam- ple of a synthetic proposition) they would not bear for us the interest that they do. Frege rhetorically asks "Can the great tree of the science of number as we know it, towering, spreading, and still continually growing, have its roots in bare identities? And how do the empty forms of logic come to dis- gorge so rich a content?" (FA, p. 22) How can the consequences of the ana- lytic principles of logic extend our knowledge? "The truth is that [mathematical judgments] are contained in their definitions, but as plants are contained in their seeds, not as beams are contained in a house." (FA, p. 101) What does this mean? Logical principles are analytic insofar as their truth arises from relations between concepts. But insofar as those concepts are objective entities, far from representing conventions about words, such analytic principles represent necessary, objective connections between ab- stract entities. Analyticity does not therefore imply triviality or conven- tionality. To play on the analogy with the beams of a house, those principles represent the necessary structure, the "logical framework," of the world. Finally, both formalism and psychologism attempt to provide a ground for logic. But any such attempt, Frege argues, commits something which is rather like Moore's "naturalistic fallacy," and opens the door to the very REALISM AND PSYCHOLOGISM IN 19TH CENTURY LOGIC 513</page><page sequence="22">sort of relativism and scepticism which psychologism was designed to avoid. All such reductive attempts are doomed: The question of why and with what right we acknowledge a law of logic to be true, logic can only answer by reducing it to another law of logic. Where this is not possible logic can give no answer. If we step away from logic, we may say; we are compelled to make judgments by our own nature, and if we do so, we cannot reject this law-of identity, for example; we must ac- knowledge it unless we wish to reduce all our thought to confusion and finally renounce all judgment whatsoever. I shall neither dispute nor support this remark; I shall merely remark that what we have here is not a logical consequence. What is given is not a reason for some- thing's being true, but for us taking it to be true.40 Here Frege implies that support can be found for the principles of logic, but what form could such support take? Is there somefurther science, more fun- damental than logic, in which logical principles find their ground? And if so, is not that science the rightful heir to the title of logic? IV. Logical Realism and the Nature of Logic [The laws of logic] do not bear the relation to thought that the laws of grammar bear to language; they do not make explicit the nature of our human thinking and change as it changes. -Frege If psychologism is rejected, then what account can we give of the nature of logic? Frege's answer begins, interestingly, with the claim that the goal of logic is truth.41 At first glance *:.uth does not seem peculiar to logic; after all, every intellectual discipline aims at truth. But logic has a special inter- est in truth, analogous to the physicist's interest in heaviness or warmth. The logician is not so much interested in whether this or that proposition is true, but in the nature of truth and falsity. This may involve asserting cer- tain propositions as true, but such is not the end of logic. Frege therefore defines logic as "The science of the most general laws of truth."42 Truth for 40 BLA, p. 15. Compare: "Logic cannot have any empirical part; that is, a part in which the universal and necessary laws of thought should rest on grounds taken from experience; otherwise, it would not be logic, i.e., a canon for the understanding or reason, valid for all thought, and capable of demonstration.".

BROCKHAUS</page><page sequence="23">Frege is primitive, so a definition is not forthcoming. But we can delineate the class of entities to which truth or falsity can be legitimately predicated, namely, thoughts. To explicate truth and thus uncover the proper role of the logician, we must turn to Frege's celebrated distinction between sense and reference, which makes it's first appearance in the 1892 paper "On Sense and Refer- ence."43 Consider identity-statements ('a = b'), which appear to assert some relation. But what then are the relata; the objects for which the two expres- sions stand, or the signs themselves? If we choose the former, a puzzling consequence arises. If 'a = b' is true, then a and b are not two objects but one, and thus 'a = b' says the same thing as 'a = a'. Yet the latter is necessary and the former not. As Frege points out, 'The Morning Star is identical with the Evening Star' marks a real advance in our astronomical knowledge, while 'The Morning Star is identical with itself' doesonot. But on the other hand if the putative relation is construed as holding between the signs, then every statement of the form 'a = b' is false, since 'a' and 'b' are obviously different signs. Characteristically resisting the temptation to conclude that identity is thereby defective, Frege writes "It is natural, now, to think of there being connected with a sign..., besides that to which the sign refers, which may be called the reference of the sign, also what I should like to call the sense of the sign..." (op. cit., p. 57) In 'The Morning Star is identical with the Evening Star', we can distinguish the reference of the two expressions-is in each case Venus-from the sense, which is in each case different. The sense of 'The Morning Star' might be roughly the last star visible to the naked eye at daybreak, while that of 'The Evening Star' is the first star visible to the naked eye in the evening. I say "roughly" because to any given reference there will generally correspond a large number of different senses; 'Aristotle', 'Plato's greatest student', 'the teacher of Alexander' and so forth express different senses, but all have the same reference, namely, The Philosopher. The solution to the puzzle concerning identity thus lies in seeing that statements of the form 'a = b' assert that two expressions with different senses have the same reference. In addition to sense and reference, associated with most every human lin- guistic expression are certain mental occurrences-feelings, associations, perhaps mental images-which more or less regularly accompany the ex- pression, and which Frege lumps together as Vorstellungen, "ideas." Ideas are subjective, private, changeable, and "have no fixed boundaries," and it is crucially important to avoid confusing the sense of an expression with the 3 In Geach and Black, trans., Translations from the Philosophical Writings of Frege (Blackwell, Oxford, 1970), pp. 56-78. REALISM AND PSYCHOLOGISM IN 19TH CENTURY LOGIC 515</page><page sequence="24">associated ideas. The reference of an expression, with the exception of special cases like 'my pain', purports to be something objective, while the associated ideas are subjective. But what of the sense? If senses are subjective, Frege argues, there could be no common store of knowledge amongst people, and interpersonal com- munication would be impossible. There obviously is a common store of knowledge, so senses must be interpersonal and objective. With the objectiv- ity of senses, the tripart distinction between reference, sense and idea can therefore be likened to an object seen through a telescope, the real image in the telescope, and the retinal image of each particular observer. The real im- age is not the object itself, only an incomplete and partial representation of it. But it, is not for that reason subjective; it would, for instance, survive the death of all astronomers. The sense of an expression is an objective con- stituent of the world, independent of both particular minds and minds in general. The non-spatio-temporal, non-physical, objective nature of senses parallels the status of numbers in Frege's ontology. We now have the necessary conceptual equipment to answer the question raised above concerning the nature of logic. For Frege logic deals with truth in its most fundamental aspect, qua truth. Although in ordinary language we attribute truth to beliefs, objects, positions, and so forth, the sort of en- tity to which it most basically applies is a thought. We can combine this in- sight with the sense-reference distinction to claim that thoughts are the senses of assertoric sentences, and since senses are objective, so are thoughts. The role of the logician is to deal with thoughts, their properties and their relations, and since they are objective, the realm of logic is wholly distinct from that of psychology. Logic deals with the objective properties of thoughts, and not with the subjective, causal properties of thought-occur- rences. Only a failure to distinguish clearly between sense and idea, and a cer- tain prejudice in favor of the perceptible, prevents philosophers from assent- ing to this claim.44 Logic so envisioned encompasses a good part of what we now call the theory of meaning.45 44 The existence of non-perceptible but real entities entails that there must be some human faculty of knowledge which allows access to them. Frege is thus committed to a non- sensible form of knowledge which might be called a priori in the classical sense. In a letter to Honigswald written about 1924 Frege distinguishes three sources of knowledge: sense perception, the "logical source," and the "geometrical source." Cf. "Sources of Knowledge in Mathematics and the Mathematical Natural Sciences" in Posthumous Writings, pp. 267-77. Frege (like Descartes) believes that sense-perception is unreliable unless buttressed by these non-sensory sources of knowledge, although he holds even them to also be fallible. 45 Cf. Dummett, op. cit., chap. 19. Compare: "Anyone can see from my statements up to this point that for me the pure truths of logic are all the ideal laws which have their foundations in the 'senses', the 'essence' or the 'content' of the concepts of Truth, Proposition, Object, Property, Combination, Law, Fact, etc." Husserl, LI I, p. 144. 516 RICHARD R. BROCKHAUS</page><page sequence="25">The distinction between sense and idea allows Frege to set another task for the logician. Since in human beings thought (and speech) is frequently ac- companied by images, sensations and so forth, confusion of these mental oc- currences with the thinking itself is dangerously easy. If we conflate sense with idea, psychologism ensues and the role of the logician seems to be to investigate the causal laws which govern this play of images and sensations. An analogous danger arises when we confuse a thought or sense with its physical manifestation, as Mill did with Number (we might say that the naive behaviorist confuses the spoken sentence with the proposition). Frege's distinction between reference, sense and idea neatly splits language in two parts, one logical and necessary, the other "psychological" or con- ventional. Both elements are clearly operative in ordinary language; if they were not, all languages would for instance have the same grammar. Thus the logician is presented with the task of "distinguish[ing] the verbal husk from the logical kernel with which, in any given language, it appears to be organi- cally bound up."46 Let's look at an example of the essential and inessential in ordinary lan- guage. In most natural languages any sentence can be put in either the passive or active voice, without change of sense. The sentences 'M gave the document to N', 'Document A was given to N by M' and 'N re- ceived document A from M' express exactly the same thought; we learn not a whit more or less from any one of these than we do from the others. (Ibid., p. 141) The difference between active and passive voice consequently is without significancefor the logician, although in order to have survived in language it must of course have some role. But frequently such non-logical or conven- tional elements of ordinary language hinder the discovery of logically im- portant properties, either by masking those logical properties or by present- ing as essential merely conventional elements. For instance, some thoughts are negative, others positive. Is there in ordinary language some reasonably dependable sign of this logical difference? One obvious suggestion is the oc- currence of the word 'not', as when we say "The President is not wise." However, the sentence "The Pope is bald" is equivalent to "The Pope is not Mohanty writes, "The fundamental concept of logic for Frege is the concept of a truth-value. For Husserl it is the concept of meaning." op. cit., p. 15. On my analysis the difference between the two on this issue is much less. 46 "Logic," p. 142. That there is such a logical kernel present-that is, that our goal is not to replace a logically defective system of thought with another-lies beneath the surface of Frege's thought, contrasting his with Russell's and very strongly impressing Wittgenstein. "My method is not to sunder the hard from the soft, but to see the hardness of the soft." Notebooks 1916-18, trans. G. E. M. Anscombe (Blackwell, Oxford, 1969), p. 44. Wittgenstein goes on to adopt a characteristically Draconian criterion for the non- psychological. REALISM AND PSYCHOLOGISM IN 19TH CENTURY LOGIC 517</page><page sequence="26">hirsute," yet the latter alone contains 'not'. Frege observes that there is no workable grammatical sign of negativity in judgments; although we can say with assurance on logical grounds that there must be negative thoughts, we cannot with the same assurance give an example of one. Ordinary language fails to accurately reflect the logical reality of our thoughts both by failing to provide a consistent sign of the negative thought, and by providing a mis- leading claimant to that title.47 The failure of sentences which express negative thoughts to reflect that fact is but one example of the shortcomings of ordinary language. Frege mentions the confusion, so easy in ordinary language, between object-words and concept-words, which leads to many of the puzzles about number inves- tigated in FA.48 But how can we avoid such problems? One way Frege rec- ommends is the study of foreign languages; since each clothes the same thoughts in different garb we often come to recognize what is essential and what not. But this procedure is neither infallible nor general enough, since languages of the same family-Romance languages, for instance-often share general but inessential traits. Thus what is needed is a system of repre- sentation which abstracts completely from the psychological-conventional component of language, leaving only the essential or logical element. In his Begriffsschrift, his "concept-writing," Frege believes he has found just such a purified language. Of it he writes: If it is the task of philosophy to break the power of the word over the human mind, uncover- ing illusions which through the use of language almost unavoidably arise concerning the rela- tions of concepts, freeing thought from that which only the nature of linguistic means attaches to it, then my "conceptual notation," further developed for these purposes, can become a useful tool for philosophers.49 Since the Begriffsschrift must meet the minimal demands of human percepti- bility and utilize the conventions of writing, it too must contain some inessential components. That human intuition is sensible, for instance, re- quires that we use perceptible signs for concepts, objects and functions, and on a more pedestrian level the pragmatic demands of printing technology re- quire that the array of signs we utilize be two-dimensional. But such dis- crepancies between pure thought and symbolism, Frege argues, are "unavoid- able and harmless," unable to alter the Begriffsscrift's role as the "language of pure thought." 47 The problem of negative thoughts, introduced in ibid., pp. 149-50, is developed more fully in "Negation," Geach and Black op. cit., pp. 117-35. 48 For the concept/object distinction, cf. "On Concept and Object," ibid., pp. 42-55. For the puzzles of number, and their relation to the conflation of this distinction, see FAA, #97. 49 This is from the Preface, Bynum, op. cit., p. 106. 518 RICHARD R. BROCKHAUS</page><page sequence="27">Looking back on the preceding sections, we see that Post-Kantian logi- cians, conflating empirical and transcendental conditions on consciousness, tend to construe the principles of logic as general psychological rules. In ad- dition, the affinity between psychologism and nominalism renders it attrac- tive to the British Empirical tradition. Whether Frege's critique of psychol- ogism is sufficient to flatly refute psychologism and the associated Millian empiricism in mathematics is debatable and debated, but Frege does point out just how much the psychologistic logician or mathematician must be willing to surrender. Maintaining any reasonable kind of necessity for mathematical and logical truths thus requires that psychologism be shunned. The consequence of Frege's argument is that we must demand both that the principles and concepts of logic are mind-independent, that every logical or mathematical judgement have as its object some extramental entity. Although Frege's realistic arguments concentrate on mathematical and log- ical judgements, such realism allows easy and plausible generalization. Such broader realism holds that every (or almost every) judgment has some ex- tramental object which is independent of the act of judging. But in ordinary judgments like "Nixon resigned in disgrace" or "Frege wrote well," what are those extramental objects? The Begriffsschrift has shown that surface grammar can be at best misleading, and as we shall see in the following sec- tion, naive acceptance of surface grammar, when coupled with the realist thesis, produces alarming and damaging paradoxes. The following section examines the robust early realism of Russell and Moore, concentrating on the infelicitous consequences of realism, the parallel inadequacy of ordinary language, and the birth of twentieth century analysis. V. A Broader Sort of Realism For a year and a half now I have been acquainted with your Grundgesetze der Arithmetic, but it is only now that I have been able to find enough time for the thorough study I in- tended to make of your work. I find myself in complete agreement with you in all essentials, particularly when you reject any psychological element in logic ... -Russell to Frege, 1902 When Russell matriculated at Cambridge in 1890, the neo-Hegelian school centered on Bradley, Joachim, and others held, if not total sway, certainly center stage. Russell himself embraced such a position, but under the influence of Moore his youthful enthusiasm for Hegelianism crumbled. He had come to philosophy to find support for the truth of mathematical judg- REALISM AND PSYCHOLOGISM IN 19TH CENTURY LOGIC 519</page><page sequence="28">ments, and was thus constitutionally unwilling to accept the Hegelian the- sis that such judgments were not (wholly) true. Together, he and Moore led an assault from which Absolute Idealism to date has not recovered, and although the philosophical validity of these attacks is open to debate,50 the historical influence of the doctrines of Russell and Moore, as well as their almost total dominance of the British intellectual life of the day, is not.5" Bradley's Appearance and Reality (1893) sets forth an Hegelian posi- tion which although to some extent decidedly non-orthodox (compared, e.g., with the writings of his contemporary Bosanquet), argues for and traces the consequences of two major Idealist theses. The first is the Berkelian claim that esse est percipi; every object of experience is logically dependent on an experience, and subject and object are but two aspects analyzed (perhaps il- legitimately) from the unity of experience. The other is the thesis of monism; reality is in essence unitary and singular, and plurality is the sign of appearance or illusion. Bradley's defense of the thesis of monism is logical, based on the so-called doctrine of internal relations; there are no (real) rela- tions whatsoever, since the notion of a relation is logically defective. Moore assails these twin pillars of neo-Hegelianism in a series of influential papers, the two most important being "A Refutation of Idealism" (1903) and "Internal and External Relations" (1919).52 Additional impetus for the thrust towards realism and pluralism was pro- vided by his Principia Ethica; there he puts forth a devastating critique of subjectivism in ethics, arguing in a manner reminiscent of Frege that 50 Cf. for instance A. J. Ayer, Russell and Moore; the Analytic Heritage (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1970), chap. 6. 51 "I went up to Cambridge at Michaelmas of 1902, and Moore's Principia Ethica came out at the end of my first year. I have never heard of the present generation reading it, but, of course, its effect on us, and the talk which preceded and followed it, dominated, and perhaps still dominate, everything else." J. M. Keynes, "My Early Beliefs," reprinted in his Essays and Sketches in Biography (Meridian Books, New York, 1956), p. 241. "Russell's Principles of Mathemnatics came out the same year as Principia Ethica; and the former, by spirit, furnished a method for handling the material presented by the latter." Ibid., p. 244. Keynes' views on the importance of Russell and Moore were not universally held: "I think if you inquire you will find that neither your brother nor Russell have in this matter of realism convinced philosophers - at least, I was told so at Oxford with some emphasis." W. B. Yeats in a letter to Sturge Moore, dated January 1926. Cf. W. B. Yeats and T. Sturge Moore: Their Correspondence 1901-1937, ed. U. Bridge (Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1953), p. 64. 52 Both reprinted in Moore's Philosophical Papers (Roudedge and Kegan Paul, London, 1922), pp. 1-30 and 276-309 respectively. But see Moore's comments on the theses of these early papers in his "Replies" to the critical papers collected in The Philosophy of G. E. Moore, ed. P. A. Schilpp (Open Court Publishing, LaSalle, Illinois, 1942), pp. 533- 688. 520 RICHARD R. BROCKHAUS</page><page sequence="29">Goodness is a primitive, objective, non-natural property.53 But Russell's Principles of Mathematics provides the ideal stalking-horse, combining a very vivid and wide-ranging realism with an unusual willingness to accept as significant the surface grammar of ordinary language, perhaps in response to the standard Hegelian tendency to regard ordinary experience as not significant.T4 In a review of Meinong, Russell offers a straightforward definition of realism: [E]very presentation and every belief must have an object other than itself and, except in certain cases where mental existents happen to be concerned, extramental; what is commonly called perception has as its object an existential proposition, into which enters as a constituent that whose existence is concerned, and not the idea of this existent; that truth and falsehood ap- ply not to the beliefs, but to their objects; and that the object of a thought, even when this ob- ject does not exist, has a Being which is in no way dependent upon its being an object of thought.55 Consider a homely example: "The cat is on the mat." What is this sen- tence about? A realist might say the cat, the mat and perhaps (if our realist is a sophisticate) the relation of being on. This answer rests on the presupposi- tion that surface grammar-grammar in the grade-school sense-is an accu- rate reflection of logical grammar. The view that ordinary grammar is a rea- sonably accurate guide to "real" grammar has a great deal of attractiveness, particularly in the historical context of the Idealist dogma that appearance must always differ radically from reality. But perhaps most persuasive is the undeniable fact that "The cat is on the mat" is a straightforward, un- problematic example of clarity. If something about its surface grammar is fishy, how do we understand it so well? Such charitable treatment of surface grammar leads Russell to write "It must be admitted, I thiik, that every word in every sentence must have some meaning." If this were not the case, then the occurrence of that word in the sentence would be irrelevant to the meaning of the sentence, and it would not matter whether we included it or not.56 This observation combines 53 Principia Ethica, pp. 6-16. Ironically, Moore's realism might well have been influenced by the strong anti-subjectivist spirit of Bradley's monumental Principles of Logic, vols. I and II (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1883). 54 B. Russell, The Principles of Mathematics (Norton, New York, 1903). I shall hereafter refer to this work as 'PrM'. 55 B. Russell, "Meinong's Theory of Complexes and Assumption," Mind n.s. XIII (1904), p. 204. The three papers of this series are reprinted in more accessible form in Russell, Essays in Analysis, ed. D.

One of the reasons Russell offers in defense of this claim contrasts strikingly with Wittgenstein's later position. "A perfectly meaningless sound could not be REALISM AND PSYCHOLOGISM IN 19TH CENTURY LOGIC 521</page><page sequence="30">painlessly with realism to produce the linguistic correlate of the realist thesis; the meaning of a word is an (extramental) object which corresponds to the word. Every word in a sentence has a meaning insofar as it stands for some object. We might call this the name theory of language, insofar as ev- ery word functions as a name for some entity; nouns stand for things or con- cepts, verbs stand for relations, and so forth. The sledding gets a bit tougher when we turn to logical particles such as 'or' and 'not', and must deal with the question of whether there are logical objects. The charm of such a realistic theory of ordinary language is obvious; it allows us to take surface grammar quite seriously, lending a down-to-earth air to philosophical investigations. It also hints at a sort of egalitarianism. Just as Moore takes the ordinary man's ethical views and his beliefs about what exists seriously, Russell confers the same status on the ordinary man's utterances. The study of grammar, in my opinion, is capable of throwing far more light on philosophical questions than is commonly supposed by philosophers. Although a grammatical distinction cannot be uncritically assumed to correspond to a genuine philosophical difference, yet one is prima facie evidence of the other... .On the whole, grammar seems to me to bring us much nearer to a correct logic than the current opinions of philosophers, and in what follows, grammar, although not our master, will yet be taken as our guide.57 The "current opinions of philosophers" might be typified by Bradley's Principles of Logic.58 There Bradley argues that an examination of negative existential propositions ("There are no unicorns"), singular propositions and others shows us that the apparent grammatical subject is never the real logical subject.59 The real logical subject of every proposition is of course the unitary absolute reality, which can never be reached, but only approxi- mated through successive syntheses. Over against such a position, a little school grammar appears a philosophical oasis in a desert of endless synthe- S1S. This apparently happy view of the syntax and semantics of ordinary lan- guage is not without puzzles, however. Consider the following sentences: (a) The cat is on the mat, (b) The Golden Mountain exists, (c) The Golden Mountain does not exist, (d) The present Queen of England is married, (e) employed in the more or less fixed way in which language employs words." (Ibid.) It does not occur to Russell that, quite to the contrary, the meaning may well be a result of the "more or less fixed way" in which we use the word. This of course is one major theme of Wittgenstein's latter work. 57 Ibid., p. 42. Compare with J. L. Austin, "A Plea for Excuses," reprinted in his Philosophical Papers (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1959), esp. pp. 169 ff. But also compare with Locke, op. cit., p. 390. 58 F. H. Bradley, The Principles of Logic (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1883). 59 Bradley, op. cit., pp. 42 ff. 522 RICHARDR. BROCKHAUS</page><page sequence="31">The present King of France is bald, (f) The round square exists, (g) The round square is round and square. If (a) is about the cat and the mat, what is (b) about? Since there is no Golden Mountain, it is hard to see how that sen- tence can be about it. (c) is even more puzzling with that respect, because its whole point seems to be asserting that there is no Golden Mountain. (d) is true if the Queen has the requisite property, false otherwise. But what of (e)? If there is no present king of France, then common sense would indicate that the proposition in question was false. But is its negation-"The present King of France is not bald"-then true? Or must we reject the Law of Excluded Middle? Finally, even the comforting fall-back position that (b) and (e) are about merely possible entities cannot deal with (t) and (g), which appear to be about impossible entities. Even worse, (g) seems to be analytic and thus true. Faced with such difficulties, several avenues are open to the logician. In 1903 Russell chooses to swallow hard and preserve both the realist thesis and the name theory of language by admitting that expressions like "the present King of France," which appear not to stand for anything, in fact do have objects.60 As a good mathematician, perhaps bearing in mind Frege's warning that we ought not be blinded by a prejudice in favor of the spatio- temporal or "actual," Russell writes: Whatever can be the object of thought, or may occur in any true or false proposition, or can be counted as one, I call a term. This, then, is the widest term in the philosophical vocabulary. I shall use it as synonymous with the words unity, individual, and entity.. ..Every term has being, i.e., is in some sense. A man, a moment, a chimera, is sure to be a term; and to deny that such and such is a term must always be false.61 Thus anything that we can mention is for that reason a term, and the claim that such-and-such is not a term must always be nonsensical. There is an ob- vious difference, however, between the present Queen of England and the (putative) present King of France, which Russell marks by saying that the former exists, while the latter merely subsists or has Being. Russell thus echoes Meinong, who argues that "the totality of what exists, including 60 This is a bit too simple, although it will suffice for our nontechnical purposes. There are denoting expressions which denote nothing; for instance, 'all chimeras' denotes nothing insofar as 'x is a chimera' is false for all values of x; Cf. PrM #72. I take Russell to mean 'nothing existent', since this discussion occurs in the context of an extensional analysis of classes, but N. Cocciarella takes Russell to mean that they denote nothing existent or otherwise; Logical Studies in Early Analytic Philosophy (Ohio State University Press, Columbus, 1987), chap. 3 sect. 2. 61 Op. cit., p. 43. Moore's realism eschews Russell's emphasis on individuals in favor of a more Platonic analysis in terms of general entities which he calls concepts; cf. his "The Nature of Judgment," Mind (1899), pp. 176-93. REALISM AND PSYCHOLOGISM IN 19TH CENTURY LOGIC 523</page><page sequence="32">what has existed and will exist, is infinitely small in comparison to the to- tality of objects," and suggests a new science, the "theory of objects."62 There are of course real problems which stand in the way of this "new science." But it is important to see such robust realism as a natural out- growth of the turn towards common sense on the part of Russell and Moore; that at one stage it cheerfully embraces Golden Mountains, contem- porary French royalty and round squares represents a great philosophical irony. Likewise ironically, analysis-the reduction therapy Russell pre- scribes for this bloated universe-brings back to the philosophical spotlight the old idealist insistence on a fundamental distinction between appearance and reality. The realisms of the turn of the century also mark the advent of the great philosophical schism of the century. Husserl's reification of meanings sug- gests the need to investigate this new realm of real objects, and in the guise of noema, the brave new science of phenomenology embarked on the mission of investigating them. "Analytic" philosophers took quite a different tack from this common starting-point. Questions about the objects of thought can generally be reduced to questions about what we say. The question, How many sorts of things are there in the world?, for instance, reduces to, How many different sorts of things do we talk about? This move from talking about things to talking about language so characteristic of much of the phi- losophy of this century, is often puzzling or infuriating to those who do not understand the development of the theory of meanings; evidence the hostil- ity that such slogans as Quine's "To be is to be the value of a bound vari- able" evince among the unreceptive. Perhaps philosophers need to reflect more on the possibilities of unity suggested by Austin's term "linguistic phenomenology." Both movements, of course, quickly diverged in both their methods and concerns, but at their roots lingers a common realistic heritage. 62 Meinong, "The Theory of Objects," trans.
