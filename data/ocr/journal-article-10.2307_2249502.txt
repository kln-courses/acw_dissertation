<plain_text><page sequence="1">VI.-NEW BOOKS. A History of Indian Philosophy. By Prof. SURENDRANATH DASGUPTA, M.A., Ph.D. Vol. I. Cambridge, at the University Press, 1922. Pp. xvi, 528. We are now living, or trying to live, in a period of conciliation after strife; and there are few more hopeful omens for the unity of the world than the increasing interest in Eastern thought that is now being displayed in Western countries. Our own country has perhaps been culpably slow. Rabindranath Tagore has recently told us that 'if you compare England with Germany or France you will find she has produced the smallest number of scholars who have studied Indian literature and philosophy with any amount of sympathetic insight or thoroughness'. Happily, however, the Indians themselves have now begun to realise that, in a different sense from that in which the phrase was oiiginally used, they must 'educate their masters'. Tagore himself has done very effective work in this direction; and, on the more purely philosophical side, Vivekananda and others have rendered important service. Now at last attempts are being made by Indian writers to introduce us to the whole range of their philosophical development. A comprehensive history by Prof. Radhalerishnan, already well known in this country by several interesting works, has been announced as one of the forthcoming books in the 'Library of Philosophy'; and this has been forestalled by Prof. Dasgupta. On the value of his work the present reviewer is unfortunately not fully competent to pronounce a judgment. A thorough knowledge of Sanskrit would be necessary for this. All that I can attempt is to appraise it from the point of view of an English reader interested in philosophical problems. Although this volume does not cover the whole extent of Indian speculation, it includes enough to furnish us with a general survey of all the main lines of thought. It covers the period from the seventh century B.C., to which the earlier Upanishads are referred, to the beginningf of the ninth century, A. D., when the great commentaries of Sankara. generally recognised as the most influential of all the Indian philosophical writings, were composed. A Western reader, having in mnind the evolution of early thought in Greece, so apparently inevitable that Hegel was able to regard it as governed by the principle of his own dialectic, naturally hopes that an historian of Indian philosophy would be able to show in it a somewhat similar orderly march. But Prof. Dasgupta warns us at the outset that nothing of this sort is to be expected. 'It is hardly possible,' he says (p. 62), 'to attempt a history of Indian philosophy in the manner in which the histories of European philosophy have been written. In Europe from the earliest times, thinkers came one after another and offered their independent speculations on philosophy. The work of a modern historian consists in chronologically arranging these views and in com- menting upon the influence of one school upon another or upon the general change from time to time in the tides and currents of philosophy. Here in India, however, the principal systems of philosophy had their</page><page sequence="2">94 NEW BOOKS. beginning in times of which we have but scanty record, and it is hardly possible to' say correctly at what time they began, or to compute the in- fluence that led to the foundation of so many divergent systems at so early a period.' 'The systematic treatises,' he adds, 'were written in short and pregnant half-sentences (sutras) which did not elaborate the subject in detail, but served only to hold before the reader the lost threads of memory of elaborate disquisitions with which he was already thoroughly acquainted. It seems, therefore, that these pithy half-sentences were the lecture hints, intended for those who had had direct elaborate oral instructions on the subject.' It must be remembered, however, that, in order to bring the evolution of Greek thought into relation with the dialectic, Hegel had to begin with Parmenides and Heraclitus, and even somewhat to invert the historical order of these. If we go back to Pythagoras and Thales, we seem to find somethingf much more nearly resembling the beginnings of Indian speculation; and indeed in these early stages the two lines of thought have so much resemblance that some have been tempted to, refer them to a common origin. Of this there does not appear to be any evi- dence; but it seems true to say that both began as religious sects or brotherhoods rather than as bodies of scientific thinkers; and that Indian philosophy retained this characteristic much longer than was the case in- Greece. The travelling Sophists, coming from the outlying colonies, carrying ideas from one place to another, and subjecting them to open discussion, probably had a good deal to do with the change in Greece. In India it seems to have been the practice, even up to quite recent times, for isolated teachers to communicate their doctrinAs to a few -receptive disciples. At any rate, India does not appear to have ever produced such a master of free discussion as Greece had in Socrates. What we find, on the whole, is a number of separate schools, not much influenced by one another, and consequently not giving rise to any very definite line of progress. In fact, the idea of progress seems to have very little place in Indian thought. But, while there is less continuity in the history of Indian speculation than in that of Greece, it is not without some degree of unity. Its close contact with religion gives it a certain uniformity of tone. When Anaxa- goras called attention to the place of mind or spirit (voDvs) in the structure of the cosmos, he seemed, as Aristotle put it, to be like a sober man among those who idly babbled. This kind of sobriety is found in almost all Indian thinkers. They nearly all regard spirit or soul as the central reality. 'The systems of philosophy in India,' says Prof. Dasgupta (p. 71), 'were not stirred up merely by the speculative demands of the human mind . . . but by a deep craving after the realisation of the religious purpose of life.' Hence, 'with the exception of the Carvaka materialists all the other systems agree on some fundamental points of importance'. One of these is the theory of Karma and rebirth, in connexion with which 'they also agree in believing that this beginningless chain of karma and its fruits . . . has somewhere its end'. Again, 'all the Indian systems except Buddhism admit the existence of a permanent entity called atman, purusa or jiva. As to the exact nature of this soul there are indeed divergences of view.' Further, 'though the belief that the world is full of sorrow has not been equally prominently emph isised in all systems, yet it may be considered as being shared by all of them'. Finally, 'the Indian systems are all agreed upon the general principles of ethical conduct which must be followed for the attainment of salvation. That all passions are to be controlled, no injury to life I in any form should 1I understand this- to mean conscious life. Injury to plant life does not appear to be, in general, forbidden.</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS. 95 be done, and that all desire for pleasures should be checked, are principles which are almost universally acknowledged.' There is another characteristic of Indian thought, to which Prof. Dasgupta does not specifically refer, and which is perhaps not quite so universally present in it as those that he has noted, but which it seems important to notice as it is the source of some of the-most serious diffi- culties that are felt by Western minds in trying to understand Indian philosophy. I mean its tendency to take refuge in what is formless and inexpressible. It is perhaps in this respect that Indian thought is most sharply contrasted with that of Greece. Prof. Burnet has said of the early Greek philosophies that 'what we have to do is not to think them by means of rational coneepts, but to picture them in our minds by means of images. We do not understand the view we are studying till we have done this, and we ought even to be able to draw a diagram of it on paper.' There may be some exaggeration in this ; but at least it may be said that, viewing Greek philosophy as a whole, we find nothing more central and fundamental in it than the conception of Form (Jaov). It appears in the early thought of the Pythagoreans: it is the basis of the metaphysics of Plato and of the logic of Aristotle. On the ouher hand, few things are more striking in Indian thought than the constant effort to escape from name and form (Namarupa). This characteristic is found in the early Upanishads. ' When Bhava was que%tioned by Vaskali, he expounded the nature of Brahman to him by maintaining silence-" Teach me," said Vaskali, "most reverent sir, the nature of Brahman." Bhava, however, remained silent. But when the question was put forth a second and a third time he answered, " I teach you indeed but you do not understand; the Atman is silence ". The way to indicate it is thus by neti neti, it is not this, it is not this. We cannot describe it by any positive content which is always limited by conceptual thought' (p. 45). Spirituality, mysticism, pessimism, asceticism, negativity-these are the recurrent -notes in Indian speculation. This characteristic makes it often very difficult for Western minds (especially those that are accustomed to diagrams) to interpret Indian- philosophies with any clearness. As an instance, reference may be made to Buddhism. Buddhism, like Jainism, is generally classed amongf the atheistical religions. It has been so characterised by its best known English exponents; and this view of it is etntirely confirmed by Prof. Dasgrupta. 'The Mimansakas,' he says (p. 325), ' the Carvakas, the Buddhists and the Jains all deny the existence of Isvara (God).' Mr. Holmes, however, in his interesting book on The Greed of Buddha, main- -tains that the founder of the religion only 'kept silence about' the divine Being; and there appears to be some difference of view amongf the Buddhists themselves with regard to this. And indeed it may be asked whether the rejection of Isvara necessarily implies the rejection of Brahman-i.e. of the unknowable God or Absolute. It is possible that the underrating of form by Indian thinkers is partly responsible for a certain weakness that is sometimes apparent in their Logic. One of the doctrines of the Nyaya school is said to be (p. 346) that, in order to affirm the connexion between smoke and fire ' it is not enough that in all cases where there is smoke there should be fire, but it is necessary that in all those cases where there is no fire there should not be any smoke'. It seems clear that one of these statements is the obverted contrapositive of the other, and consequently does not really add anything to it. Similar errors are, I think, pretty common in the writings of Indian philosophers. Lucidity is seldom their strong point. Their arguments are often suggestive, but hardly ever cogent. They do not bear comparison with the reasonings of Zeno or Socrates. Nor are their</page><page sequence="4">96 NEW BOOKS. definitions always illuminating. According to Kanada, for example, (p. 288), 'Time is defined as that which gives the notion of youth in the young, simultaneity, and quickness'. On the other hand, it is often claimed as one of the great merits of Indian philosophy that its terminology is singularly precise. The Sanskrit words that are employed in it have not been corrupted by popular usage in the way that most of the words that are current in the European languages have been. It is probably true that even Greek suffered in this respect more than Sanskrit ever did. We see here one of the few advantages of keeping scientific study in the hands, of a select class of experts. It is disappointing, however, to find that even in the use of Sanskrit terms one cannot always be sure of the precise meaning; and I think it is the chief defect of Prof. Dasgupta's valuable work that he has not made a sufficient effort to make their meaniing clear to English readers. It may be worth while to refer to one or two instances. Manas is one of the terms for which it is most difficult to find a precise equivalent. It is usually translated 'mind,' with which of course it is etymologically connected; but this does not make it sufficiently definite. It has been suggested that its meaning corresponds pretty closely to ' attention,' especially in the sense in which that term is used by Dr. Ward. When 'mind' is used colloquially as a verb-as in 'mind your own business'-it approximates to this meaning. But sometimes also manas seems almost to correspond to 'intellect' in the sense in which it is employed by M. Bergson, or to 'understanding,' as distinguished from reason. It is, however, somewhat disconcerting to find that in one place (p. 25) Prof. Dasgupta translates it 'soul'. In other passages mind and soul are sharply distinguished. Thus on page 300, in giving an account of the Nyaya-Vaisesika philosophy, it is stated that 'Desire and antipathy also belong to the soul. None of these can belong either to the body or to the mind (manas).' Similarly, on pages 292, 295, 298, 311, manas is translated 'mind,' and pretty definitelydistinguished from 'soul'. Of course the distinction is common enough' in English, as in Tennyson's phrase 'That mind and soul, according well, May make one music as before'; but one would like to have the distinction more precisely explained and more uniformly observed. There seems als ) to be some lack of consistency in the explanation of the 'gunas'. On page 224 we are told that 'the Kasrika speaks of the gunas as being of the nature of pleasure, pain, and dullness (sattva, .rajas and tamas). It also describes sattva as being light and illuminating, rajas as of the nature of energy and causing motion, and tamas as heavy and obstructing.' This appears to be the usual interpretation of the terms. But on page 264 we find it stated that 'Tamas, we know, represents the pain substance'. There can be no doubt that Prof. Dasgupta's book contains a great deal of interesting material; and, coming from one who is a recognised-expert in Sanskrit, it may be accepted as, in general, thoroughly reliable. But its value would be greatly enhanced for English readers if the Sanskrit terms were more fully explained and more consistently employed. The second volume will be awaited with eager anticipation; and we may hope that it will throw much further light on some things that remain a little obscure in the first. The later developments of Indian thought are less well known in this country than its early lispings. J. S.

Pp. xvi, 6i25. It is safe to prophesy that this book will take rank as a classic, not on account of any strikingly new doctrine, although it has much originality of thought, but for its masterly interpretation of the evolution of a central philosophical problem. It places its author among the leaders of modern French thought, with men who like Lachelier and Boutroux, whom we have receAtly lost, are valued for the direction they give to philosophical research. The book itself is admirable in conception, clear in expression, and sustained in interest. Its theme is, the reciprocal work of positive science and speculative philosophy in evolving the new way of thinking the physical reality of the universe, which is called for by the principle of generalised relativity; and, more particularly, the historical stages by which in the last three centuries the concept of physical causality has changed its Aristotelian, anthropomorphic, character and, in becoming amenable to a purely geometrical treatment, has become humanist without ceasing to be scientific. The problem is simple enough. A stone detached from a wall falling on a man kills him; it would not even have injured him had it touched him the moment it became detached. How then did it acquire that addi- tional force from the single difference of the height? This problem has exercised generations of physicists and metaphysicists in ever-repeated efforts to explain it. Suppose, however, that we see the stone hurled on the man by his neighbour who has a grudge against him, then, on the contrary, there is no mystery for we seem to know the causo. Yet it is precisely the same problem except that we have the impression that we understand perfectly both the means used and the end sought. Curiosity is completely satisfied. We think we have found a perfectly natural in- terpretation of a strictly physical event, which in itself is devoid of any explanatory character, when we find there is joined to it an event of psychical origin. It is purely illusory. Like Tennyson's "flower in the crannied wall " the humble fact of everyday experience conceals the whole mystery of man and God and nature. Hume compared the principles of union among simple ideas to the Newtonian law of gravitation. There is the same mysterious inexplicability in each. " Here is a kind of attraction, which in the mental world will be found to have as extraordinary effects as in the natural." (Treatise I. 4.) Is it possible then from the standpoint of pure empiricism to offer a theory of the relations between experience and causality which will satisfy the requirements of modern science? At first sight nothing seems easier. Are we not continually learning from experience in daily life, and are we not thereby supplied with abundant illustration of the natural interpreta- tion of physical causation? This natural interpretation, however, met its complete check in the scepticism of Hume. Hume's scepticism must be answered, for if it is impossible to find in immediate experience anything to justify the law of physical causality, then every bond between pheno- mena is dissolved and the effort of modern thouglht to constitute a science of the universe,Kwithout theological postulates, is compromised. It is the complete failure of pure empiricism to do this which is the ground of the modern idealist theory in philosophy, and the modern principle of rela- tivity confirms it in science. Prof. Brunschvicg begins by examining the two notable attempts in modern times to meet Hume's scepticism from the standpoint of pure empiricism, namely, Maine de Biran's doctrine of internal experience and John Stuart Mill's associationism. The comparison and juxtaposition) 7</page><page sequence="6">98 NEW BOOKS. these two doctrines is very instructive. Maine de Biran's principle is that we conceive substance without inwardly perceiving it whereas we inwardly perceive force and in so doingf at the same time conceive it outside us. Substance and force are distinguished in his theory by a radical difference of rhybhm. Following the notion of substance we go from without to within, following the notion of force, from within to without. But what is there in this inwardly perceived force to convince us that there exist causes or productive forces outside us, like to those we employ in moving our body and which constitute the self-feelingg? This is the crucial question as regards physical causality and Biran's principle cannot enlighten us. Mill's conception is the direct opposite. His theory of induction implies that we can apprehend causality as it exists directly in nature, without the addition of anything by the mind to the actually observed data, by making use of the purely negative process of elimina- tion. We decompose thread by thread the entangled skein of apparent sequences and so allow the regular uniformity of succession to be isolated. The reply to this, according to Prof. Brunschvicg, is that such a process is falsified by the whole history of science. The universe of immediate experience contains less, and not, as Mill's theory supposes, more than science requires. This criticism of pure empiricist method is preliminary to the histori- cal treatment of the problem which is introduced by a consideration of the pre-scientific period of human thought. In this part of his work Prof. Brunschvicg follows the sociological and anthropological studies of the late Prof. Durkheim and of his present colleague Prof. Levy-Bruhl, ,with a view to making clear the nature of the Aristotelian system of the four causes which has imposed itself on scientific and philosophic thought to our own day, and which in particular determined the intellectual organ- isation of experience in the medieval period before the rise of modern science. There is, he tells' us, a contradiction which is explicit in Aristotle and which goes to the heart of the system. It seems equally Aristotelian to say that it is the matter, or that it is the form, which individualisee. There are two divergent and equally dominant tendencies of the Aristotelian philosophy, artificialism and naturalism. In inter- preting the relations of matter and form Aristotle takes by turns the standpoint of a, sculptor and that of a naturalist, For the sculptor the unformed matter pre-exists; in the work of art the form is the principle of individuality. But when we pass to nature and take the standpoint of the naturalist, we see a plurality of individuals of the same species. It is then the form which is homogeneous and the matter which makes the difference. With Descartes and Galileo we enter on the period which Prof. Bruns- chvicg terms that of mechanics, and he traces the development of the concept of physical causality through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to its apparent fixity in the philosophy of Kant. In the nine- teenth century we have the rise and progress of the physical ideas, the most recent of which is the theory of generalised relativity. This com- pletes the historical survey. After following the various historical stages of the evolution of the concept Prof. Brunschvicg discusses, first, 'the constitution of physical causality, and ,next, the phases of human experience, developing the philosophical theory which his historical review has been intended to demonstrate. A quotation from the historical portion will indicate his standpoint better than any attempt to describe it. Referring to Pascal's pessimistic reflexion on the two infinities, that of the infinitely great and that of the infinitely small, " Quo fera-t-il donc, sinon d'apercevoir quelque apparence du milieu des choses, dans un desespoir eternel de</page><page sequence="7">NEW BOOKS. 99 connaitre ni leur principe ni leur fin ? " he says: "The idealism of the infinite is quite different from a mere check to the realism of the finite. Its meaning is to express the unlimited fecundity which modern science reveals in intelligence, and which enables us to define intellectualism, taken in its authentic meaning, as the philosophy of pure activity. Mind is that for which, in Spinoza's formula, all determination is negation, that which in Malebranche's formula, ' se sent toujours du mouvement pour aller plus loin '." On the scientific side, the conclusion which Prof. Brunschvicego draws from his survey of three centuries of positive methods in science, is that in starting from space and time to construct causality, in going from the form to the ground, we get no more than movement, that is no more than the abstract and artificial scheme of the action. This at once suggests Bergson's doctrine that " notre intelligence, telle qu'elle sort des mains de la nature, a pour objet principal le solide inorganis4 ". Prof. Bruns- chvicg, however, finds a difficulty in accepting this theory of the intellect although he is in the fullest sympathy with the general direction of Bergson's thought. His objection is of peculiar interest because it seems to indicate at once the way in which Bergson's metaphysics accords with the relativist principle in science and the way in which that principle is determining the development of Bergson's doctrine. Most criticisms of Bergson's creative evolution have fastened on a certain inconsistency (apparent, whether real or not) due to his realistic attitude in sciencp. Life is the fundamental reality, the vraie duree, and yet it appears de- pendent on some independently existing reality, for it requires the matter on which it will exert the creative power. In the theory of creative evolution it finds this in the inert matter 'of the 'physical universe. It achieves its results by humbling and insinuating itself, in order to turn back the descent which characterises tthe direction of the movemnent of matter. Yet on the other hand Bergson is equally insistent that the solid form of matter is imposed by the intellect, and that the intellect is a mode of life devised to frame the flowing reality, shaping it to accord with the practical form which action calls for. According to Prof. Brunschvicg this concept has its source in the philosophy of mathematics made classical by Kant in the Transcendental Aesthetic. " LX, en effet, avec le nombre entier et la geometrie euclidienne, le monde de la quantit6 apparaissait donne d'un coup, X jamais cristallise dans des formes a priori." Mathematical physics, proceeding by deduction, requires the sacrifice of what experience reveals of the different and specific, of the perpetually mobile and the perpetually new; but we have now reached a point in the evolution of three centuries of human thought when it has become no longer possible to present the realism of quality as an alterna- tive to' the realism ,of quantity. The two realisms are mutually self- destructive, or rather, we should say, both have given place to an idealism in which mathematics is a supple and living instrument, infinitely plastic and marvellously fruitful, able to apprehend and actualise, at least for the intellect if not to the senses, those qualities which the infirmity of our bodily organism and of our perceptive powers would suffer to escape; and also able to give precision and delicacy to our knowledge of those qualities which come within the ranfge of our ordinary perception, binding them together in the universal reality which conditions their becoming. So it is not, Prof. Brunschvicg would say, the intellect which is at fault, it is rather the representative imagination which wants to see a thing where there is only question of understanding a r-elation. Prof. Brunschvicg's conclusion is that strictly speaking there is not and cannot be a philosophy of nature nor even a philosophy of science, the only philosophy is a philosophy of thought (de la pens6e). The historical</page><page sequence="8">100 NEW BOOKS. survey, he tells us, does not presejnt to us a finished picture of scientific achievement, distributed in channels whose course has been marked out in advance, satisfying our taste for symmetry or our mania for order. What it does present is totally different and yet unquestionably richer- the course of the thinking stream itself with its windings and sudden turnings, the placid pools, and the whirlpools and rapids, of its natural flow. Taken at any given momeent, at the present epoch for example, human thought represents no more than a particular point in the rivers' course. Nature, thought of independently of the mind which knows, is an abstraction, and so likewise is science, thought of independently of its becoming. The very complicated curve which would be required to mark out in our present knowledge the configuration of our scientific universe is no more than a momentary cut in the chain which binds together man- kind in one evolution. Other cuts would give different curves correspond- ing to the ideas which different generations have had of the universe. Does a humanism of this form make science impossible and condemn us to subjectivism ? That it does so is the charge which realism is always urging against idealism. If it was ever true of the old idealism it is certainly a wrong interpretation of the new, of the idealism which is based on modern psychology and critical reflexion. The universe which we know is not posterior to ourselves who know it. We know ourselves as individuals occupying a portion of space and living in time, only after having organised, and in organising, our visual and tactile impressions so as to give us a plurality of mobile objects against the successive back- grounds which govern our horizon; and we become conscious of ourselves only as one among these objects. Were we to be unsuccessful in im- posing a reasonable order on the world which surrounds us, we should not be ourselves reasonable beings to ourselves. The universe of idealism is not therefore one which is dissolved in the subjectivity of the individual consciousness; it is that which is imposed on the intellectual conscious- ness, truth's judgment-seat. Such is the general argument and conclusion of this exceptionally interesting and able historical treatise. I have given but an inadequate account of the richness of the material. Prof. Brunschvieg is peculiarly at home in everything which concerns the great mathematical philosophers of the seventeeinth century. One quotation which he has given from a letter of Descartes's (22nd August, 1634) is of curious interest in regard to present problems. It seems a direct anticipation of the actual experi- ment which has revolutionised modern scientific theory. " Si quelqu'un portant de nuit un flambeau X la main, et le faisant mouvoir, jette la vue sur un miroir 6loign6 de lui d'un quart de lieue, il pourra tr6s aisement remarquer s'il sentira le mouvement qui se fait en sa main, auparavant de le voir par le moyen du miroir." H. WILDON CARR. The Misuse of Mind: A Study of Bergson's Attack on Intellectualism. By KARIN STEPHEN. With a Prefatory Letter by HENRI BEIRSON. London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., Ltd., 1922. Pp. 107. It is not always that a philosopher finds an expositor for whose services he can be thankful without any reservation, and there are probably very few who have been as fortunate as Bergson is in the present instance. No philosopher has stood more in need of being saved from his friends. His work came just at the moment when every one was ready for a revolt against the confident rationalism of the nineteenth century, and probably many of those who talked most enthusiastically of Bergson were content</page><page sequence="9">NEW BOOKS. 101 to know little more of him than that, somehow or other, he was the enemy of " intellectualism ". One is reminded of the lady (so pleasantly imagined by M. Abel Hermant) who endowed a laboratory for the production of radium, because she had heard that the discovery of radium proved the bankruptcy of science-and it was impossible to be too grateful for the existence of " a metal so reactionary ". It is one of Mrs. Stephen's main objects to show that the Berzson of popular imagination is not the real Bergson. A first reading, she admits, may leave one with the feeling that his philosophy is " at once too per- suasive and too vague, specious and unsatisfying"; but closer study reveals in him "a coherent theory of reality and a new and promising method of investigating it " i Although there already exist several able treatises on the Bergsonian philosophy, it is not too much to say that the present work will give many people quite a new impression of it. This is because the method of ex- position adopted is as different as can be from Bergson's own method. Mrs. Stephen has so completely assimilated the spirit of her master that she is able to treat his ideas with perfect freedom. As he himself says in the note prefaced to the book, " L'auteur . . . a pu ramener C l'unit6, et presenter avec une grande rigueur logique, des. vues que j'avais 6te oblige, en raison de ma methode de recherche, d'isoler les unes des autres ". Such an achievement demands much more than a mere understanding of the original work; it demands a real freshness of thought, and a high measure of the power of exposition. As regards the last point, Mrs. Stephen writes so well that her book would be a pleasure to read apart altogether from the interest of the subject-matter. The apparent ease of the exposition conceals the considerable skill with which she has chosen her leading conceptions and built up her argument. The whole argument of the essay is, one might say, severely empirical. Throughout, Mrs. Stephen is addressing herself to one main question: What is the nature of the fact with which we are -confronted i'n immediate experience ? The reply being that it is a piece of -duration (the particular phrase used does not really matter, since description in words is impos- sible), two further questions remain, (a) why does the intelligence imrnmediately proceed to describe and explain the fact in abstract terms, thereby falsifying it, and (b) how is it that after all we are able to make use with so much success of descriptions and explanations? I shall not attempt to follow the unfolding of the argument; suffice it to say that the difficulties of the position are always faced frankly. Mrs. Stephen never takes refuge in vague phrases; if she has to use a metaphor, she takes care to point out first that she is about to employ one, and explains just how far it can carry us. Indeed one of the best parts of the work are those pages in whiph she makes it clear how (if Bergson's view of reality is correct) all attempts to describe the immediate facts in words must fail, and explains just what service words can render in the matter. Since words all stand for abstractions, there are really only two courses open to us if we wish to try to describe in words facts which are not abstractions. Either we can resort to metaphor, or we can use abstract terms, always taking care to point out that the logical implica- tions of those terms are not true of the facts. Bergson himself usually chooses the first of these courses. Mrs. Stephen has chosen the second, and her scrupulous care in always pointinog out, whenever she has used a word, that she does not really quite mean what she has said, effectually removes all chance of misunderstanding. The treatment on those lines of the conceptions of " matter" and "memory " is particularly interesting. There are none of those adventur- ous excursions into what one might call the realm of mythology with</page><page sequence="10">102 NEW BOOKS. which Bergson has eilivened his pages; we hear nothing about the effort of spirit to introduce freedom into matter. Mrs. Stephen never wanders far from her problem, What is the, nature of the facts we immediately experience ? and in her pages "matter " and " memory" are only two complementary abstract terms which she employs in the attempt to describe those immediately given facts. It is unnecessary to discuss the question whether Mrs. Stephen's pre- sentment of Bergson's philosophy is a thoroughly faithful one. No one can be so well qualified to decide' as Bergson himself, and he appears to have no doubt on the matter. Nor is this the place to undertake a re- valuation of that philosophy. I shall mention only oiie point which has struck me in connexion with the present book. Somehow, when stripped of the clothing of metaphor in which its author chose to convey his thought, a good deal of the Bergsonian attack on intellectualism appears less startlingly novel than it did when it first came within the view of the English philosophical public. It would be going too far, of course, to say as some have done that Bergsonianism is only one of the many possible variants of idealism or absolutism, that its account of the ultimate nature of reality and of the way in which that reality transcends relational thought differs more in terminology than in substance from the account of Plotinus or the account of Bradley. No doubt Bergson's insistence on change as being of the very essence of reality does strike a new note; though even here it would surely be a mistake to suppose that when a Neo-Platonic mystic talks of God as un- changing he means merely static-and is a " timeless activity " so very different from a " dur6e " in which past and present are not real distinc- tions ? But it is not so much of parallels like these that I am thinking ; the resemblance comes out at least as strongly when we confine ourselves within the limits which the authoress has chosen, and talk of, nothing more transcendental than the nature of immediate experience. It is evident I think that when Mrs. Stephen talks of the logical or abstract way of dealing with reality, the kind of theory which she has mostly in mind is something akin to the New Realism. Constantly she offers to us the alternatives, either a universe of real duration or a universe of "mutually exclusive terms joined by external relations". In Bergson's own exposition the second alternative is scarcely defined so sharply as it is in his disciple's. The technical terms of the New Realism seem to flow naturally from her pen. For this very reason a realist might be inclined to accord to Mrs. Stephen's argumnents a closer attention than to those of Bergson himself-it is more difficult to ignore criticisms expressed in one's own language than criticisms expressed in some other language. But a realist approaching in this spirit Mrs. Stephen's attack on logical abstraction will find stealing over him as he reads a feeling that he has met attacks rather like this before. And whenl he comes on a passage such as that on page 83, " Abstraction involves falsification and so the little fragment of fact to which our attention is usually confined is not, as it stands, reality: it is appearance. We should only know reality as it is if we could replace this fragment in its proper context in the whole field of virtual knowledge (or reality) where it belongs "-when he comes on such a passage the very language seems to take him back to a day before Bergson (or the New Realism either for that matter) was ever heard of. Of course there is more than this in Bergson, and in Mrs. Stephen also. I have deliberately chosen a passage in which she seems to come nearest to Idealism, a passage in which what she says appears least original; and therefore not a typical' passage. I have already, I hope, made it clear that her book is as far as possible from being a mere echo</page><page sequence="11">NEW BOOKS. 103 of any othet writer, even of her own master Bergson. It is, on the contrary, singularly individual in the manner of writing. In the body of the work I have noticed only one misprint-in line 7, page 67. Unfortunately the same standard of accuracy has not been preserved in the printing of Bergson's prefatory letter. Ce qui: should be ce que, and fundamentales has been substituted for fond amentales.

The term " relativity " has come within the last few years to be applied not only to the purely physical theory developed by Einstein and his followers, but to a philosophical system allied to monadism. The result- ing confusion of thought has led some philosophers to think that the success of the physical theory in some way confirms one or other philo- sophical theory. This is not the case: there is no self-consistent philo- sophical system that is not completely consistent with the theory of relativity as stated by Einstein himself, or indeed with any scientific theory whatever, true or false. Any philosophical interpretation of the theory is, in fact, an extraneous addition to the theory itself, made in accordance with the metaphysical attitude of the 'writer making it; the opinion of no scientific man concerning the theory itself need be\ deter- mined by his acceptance or rejection of the metaphysical additions. Realisation of the essential independence of science and metaphysics led Ernst Mach and- Karl Pearson independently to formulate closely similar theories of scientific knowledge that would as far as possible eliminate metaphysics. Complete elimination of a priori beliefs is im- possible, since lmany logical principles (largely relating to classes and their properties) must be used in any case. Nevertheless these writers showed that a very large number of the unanalysed notions of contemporary science could be eliminated, or else defined in terms of more easily intelligible concepts. Realising that all empirical knowledge depends ultimately on our senses, they took sensations as their ultimate data, and specified the function of science as the description and classification of sensations in the most economical way. A concept is valuable in science (and in everyday life) if it facilitates sueb classification, and the only meaning attached to the " reality " of any concept in scientific work is that it is valuable in this way. This description achieved, descriptive science has no further function, and requires no ideas whatever beyond sense-experience and the principles of classification. Such description is, however, not the sole function of science. It can cover only actual experience, and has no direct application to inferences regarding sensations not yet experienced. Now inference is one of the most important functions of science, and it is indeed from the possibilities of inference that it opens up that science derives most of its interest. We cannot, however, pass directly 'from our past experience to any inference regarding future experience without certain' principles of proba- bility, which are not required in purely descriptive science. The only reason given by Mach and Pearson for the invariable practice of adopting the simplest laws that cover the -known facts is that this procedure enables us to describe them in the most economiical way. When the theory of inference is considered, a further and much more important reason is discovered. The number of laws that would fit any given set of facts is always infinite. It has been pointed out by Dr. Dorothy Wrinch and-the reviewer (Phil. Mllag., Nov. 1921, pp. 369-390) that</page><page sequence="12">104 NEW BOOKS. if the simplest law was selected for the sake of convenience alone, we could not attach the high probabilities we actually do to quantitative inferences from simple laws. In fact we attach a specially high prior probability to the simplest law, and it is for this reason that, when simple laws have been frequently, verified, the probabilities of inferences from them approach certainty so closely. Accordingly the current uractice rests on much more inmportant foundations than mere convenience, and to this extent the system of Mach and Pearson has gained in security since it was first formulated. But the discovery of laws and the making of inferences from them do not exhaust the domain of science: for this also includes, hypotheses. In a new hypothesis, some new relation may be postulated between con- cepts already established in science, or concepts with no previous scientific status may be introduced. Hypotheses belonging to the second class acquire scientific interest when the laws found to hold between the newly introduced concepts resemble in formal character the laws already known to hold between concepts of scientific status. To deduce from this fact that the hypothetical anid the scientific concepts are identical is a mistake frequently made. To identify two things because they have some of their properties in common is like saying that heat is the same as water vapour because the equations of diffusion and heat conduction are identical. We can be, and often are, enabled by such resemblances of properties to assign high probabilities to the possession in common of still more properties by a new concept and by concep1Rs already established in scientific knowledge.' There is no limit to the number and complexity of the hypothetical entities and the relations between them that we are at liberty to consider; but thera is a limit to those that are worth con- sidering in science, for it is of no use to adopt hypotheses that suggest no laws that cannot be inferred from laws already known. Expressing this loosely, we may say that it is useless to adopt hypotheses exceeding in number the laws they are intended to correlate. For instance, the kinetic theory of gases accounts for the laws of Boyle and Charles only when we introduce the extraneous assumption that the mean energy per degree of freedom is proportional 'to the measured absolute temperature. Thus two hypotheses are needed to account for two laws, and up to this point the theory is only of mathematical inter3st. It acquires physical interest when it is shown that the laws of heat conduction, viscosity, and diffusion can be included in the theory without further hypotheses. The history of the theory of relativity provides examples of every one of these stages of scientific development. Newton's dynamics supposed all motion to be referable to some standard -system of rectangular co- ordinates; but when his theory was examined closely, it was readily seen that his laws could be expressed as differential equations involving only differences between his co-ordinates and not their absolute values. Further, such differences between the co-ordinates were in fact all that could be measured. Thus Newton's dynamics, so far as it was verifiable, concerned only relative, and not absolute, position and motion. This proposition is called the " principle of relativity '. The notion of absolute position remained perfectly consistent with the Newtonian system: it merely does not, arise in the description of experience or the inference of new experience. It might, however, have happened that some phenomenon, not purely dynamical, would be found to satisfy laws of a specially simple kind when referred to some particular system of rectangular co-ordinates, and many 'attempts to find such a phenomenon were made, but without success. 1 Cf. Dr. D. Wrinch in Proc. Arist. Soc., 1919-20.</page><page sequence="13">NEW BOOKS. 105 In Newton's theory, a body moving with infinite velocity with reference to one set of co-ordinates is moving with infinite velocity with reference to any other set. This is a physical proposition, capable of being tested by physical methods. The startling result of the experiment of Michelson and Morley was that there was such an invariant velocity, but that instead of being infinite, it was the velocity of light. Thus physicists were faced with the task of modifying Newton's dynamics so as to main- tain the principle of relativity and reconcile it with the invariance of the velocity of light. There was nothing new in the principle of relativity itself, which is at old as Newton: the novelty of Einstein's special theory was that it carried out this reconciliation. Further, it was by far the simplest theory that could achieve it. The general theory involves a further mathematical hypothesis that cannot be expressed in non-technical language. The present position of the problem is that the general theory is the simples that fits all the facts, both dynamical, optical, and electrical. This is all that is meant when we speak of a physical law as true, and the status of the general theory is therefore that of a true law. The further extension made by Weyl suggests that if indistinguishable measuring instruments are carried about in two different ways to arrive at the same place at the same moment, they will differ when comnpared again. He shows that by a certain development of this hypothesis he can find functions that satisfy conditions formally identical with the electro-magnetic field equations. The number of hypotheses made on the way, however, appears to be at least as great as that of the laws co- ordinated, and therefore it appears to the reviewer to be only an interest- ing formal property of the electromagnetic field equations; it is not a valuable hypothesis because it suggests no more laws than it postulates, The book under review contains a complete account of the mathematics of the theory of relativity, developed on geometrical lines. It is recom- mended on the wrapper as " enabling the physicist of fimited mathematical attainments to grasp the details of Einstein's theory," but this statement is scarcely correct, since the mathematics is long and difficult, and for the most part expressed in an extremely condensed form. From the point of view of scientific method it suffers from several faults. The geometri- cal method of presentation puts the whole into the form of a hypothesis, and it is extraordinarily difficult to ascertain from the text to what extent any part of the theory fulfils the necessary characteristics of a scientific law. Further, the book is full of statements, presented as striking physical results, which actually amount onlv to slight restatements of what we knew already. The presentation of the physical evidence for the theory is very incomplete, and there is no hint of its present scientific status. This feature is common to all textbooks of relativity, but is possessed to an unusual extent by this one. In short, the book is to be recommended as differential geometry, but not as physics nor as an example of scientific method. HAROLD JEFFREYS. La Religion et La Foi. By HENRI DE1ACROIX. Paris: Librairie F6lix Alcan, 1921. Pp. xii, 462. This solid work on the -psychology of ieligion, by an author to whom we owe a more than usually valuable study of mysticism, is not unworthy to stand beside the captivating Giffords of James. It is written in a style more compressed and (so to say) granular, than we are accustomed to in French, with the result that it is packed very full indeed of research ;and interpretation and original theory, all set out in a wholly impartial</page><page sequence="14">106 NEW BOOKS. spirit. Not that anyone can be quite impartial when writing about re- ligion, even in the r6le of a psychologist. Also from time to time it is diffi- cult to be sure whether M. Delacroix is speaking in propria per-sona or is re- port,ing on a particular type of opinion. When, e.g., on page l28, he wiites - " Not the content of faith imposes it, but at first exterior testimony," it is true enough that here and elsewhere h- is, technically, giving an account of mediaeval Roman thought, and so far he undoubtedly is within his rights. But I have felt more than once in perusing his masterly work as, if the suggestion were being made that the medieval way of thinking about faith is the classic way, and that to think otherwise could only be the result of ignoring the rules of the game. Perhaps this merely in- ductive, and, as it were, statistical manner of settling what faith really is can hardly be avoided by one who occupies the psychological point of view, but it does help to remind us that psychology is only an abstraction after all. The book is divided into three parts. Part 1. treats of implicit faith,. reasoning faith, and trust (fiducia); Part II. of mystic certitude, prophetice inspiration, and fanaticism; Part III. of conversion and doubt. It will be se'en that the bill of fare is crowded with promising items, and that the range of interest is wide but not too wide. At the end a chapter is given to conclusions and prognostications. Reminding us that his work is a study of the manner of believing, not of beliefs, M. Delacroix begins with an analysis of implicit or collectives faith, a type found in many other religions than Catholicism ; it has been called authority-faith. When implicit faith becomes aware of the value of the received authority, it is on the point of modifying its character. We come upon subtle and informing accounts of such things as religious realism and the symbolism of faith, illustrated now from primitive worships, now from the mystery.cults of the Helljnistic period, now from ancient or modern Christianity. There is, too, an admirable section on the psy- chology of the religious crowd, particularly with regard to its teleological unity; for it is animated by a single purpose. The various forms of ecstatic worship are vividly set out. All this, and indeed the whole ex- position, is fully documented. In the next chapter M. Delacroix dwells on the oscillation in faith be- tween rationalism and irrationalism, as when in Catholic theology it is8 held both that 'mysteries are beyond reason and that none the less there are analogies in reason which enable us to understand up to a point. (This term " irrational " threatens to become fashionable in studies of re- ligion, but in fact it is not a happy one; what is really meant is that in specifically religious experience we have to do with values other than purely logical values, so that with equal justice and equal infelicity we might apply it to the experiences of morality and art.) 1 It is an acuate observa- tion (p. 112), that in religion the sense of mystery grows and becomes definite in proportion to the-growth of our knowledge of ourselves and the world; so far from disappearing in the presence of science, it is felt to be inore vital than ever. St. Thomas' teaching on faith is usefully sum- marised. A few good pages are given to the relations, in Catholic doctrine, between the self-evidence of testimony and the authority of the wit- ness. Perhaps the writer might with benefit have raised the question how far faith in God is (or is felt to be) analogous to faith in friends. I have found him less illuminating than I had hoped on the difficult point how -Catholic thought passes from the alleged rationally proved truth that God 1 Besides, why call that " irrational " which in the judgment of its ad- herents alonw imparts meaning, in the ultimate sense, to human life and history ?</page><page sequence="15">NEW BOOKS. 107 exists to the " proved " truth that He has revealed this or that doctrine. And in an all-round discussion of the intellectual conditions of faith it is odd to find not a word said about the immensely significant debate carried onl by post-Kantian Protestant theology, above all in the thirty years covered by the Rtitschlian movement. This probably accounts for the writer's failure-it seems the great omission of his book-to inquire into the relations of faith and history. I do not mean the question whether revelation can actually be given tbrough history, and whether such a. revelation has been given: that is beyond his task as a psychologist. But there are great psychological questions which relate to the normally felt, dependence of faith on historical persons and events, not on moral or nleta- physical generalisations; and a full treatment of this matter would have been welcome. It is surely worth while to ask how what goes on in the mind of one to whom the Founder of Christianity is at once necessary and self-authenticating differs from what goes on in the mind of a characteristic mystic, for whom " these things never happened, because they are happen- ing all the time ". What are the conditions, what is the quality, of that vital interest in the historical personality which is felt in the one case, but not in the other ? Delicate shades in rationalism, and various proportions in which it may be combined with self-surrender to an infinite object, are - brought out with fine and sure touch. There has always been a " rationalistic " strain in Christianity, and in a sense Scholasticism is the great proof. " It is the supreme effort on the part of the religious mind to take full cognisance of all the theses implied in religion and all the intellectual conditions it must satisfy " (p. 183). M. Delacroix includes a brief chapter on the symbolo-fideist movement led by Sabatier and MVelnegoz, but his perceptions in this region are rather less trustworthy. He speaks of it as circling round " a kind of pious sen- sation which awakens faith, keeping it always fresh and always vague This quite ignores Sabatier's view of revelation, still more that of Menegoz. And it is a particularly unfortunate suggestion that symbolo-fideism has its ancient analogue in the allegorical interpretations of Stoicism. Stoicism knew nothing of a historical mediator on whom everything turned in the relations of God and man, but just such a mediator is crucial for the thought of the Paris school. We must not look for too much at this point from a critic who can say (p. 224) that " in the subjective thought of fideism, the believer's spirit is directly the Spirit itself," and that for it " beliefs are produced by sentiments, the sentiments are the supreme reality ". A9 might be supposed, the chapter on mystic certitudq is a notably fresh and lucid piece of work, which could be fitly criticised by no one but a rival master of the subject. Mysticism iLi its many forms and hues is nowhere better displayed with brevity. Ecstasy is a quest of the in- distinct, while yet at the same time the mystic has the feeling that he is comprehending the mysteries intellectually. Apparently in itself mysti- cism is fairly indifferent to morality, and moral action is not so much a result of ecstasy as a revulsion from it ; or, it, may be, derives from other sources. The close tie often existing between mysticism anid music is commented on. It is rightly pointed out that two types of prophecy are known: the ecstatic and the reasoning. Much that is good is said about the mental and oral mechanism of prophecy, but insufficient emphasis, it seems to me, is laid on the moral distinctions between the " false " prophet and the " true ". He who told the people " smooth things " was repudiated by prophetic minds of the higher type. In this account of the working of "grace" in inspiration, too little attention is paid to ethical points ofS</page><page sequence="16">108 NEW BOOKS. attachment in the mind alike of the prophet and of those to whom he ,spoke. Here, as always, religion is sui gnereris, yet its progress can be measured by deepening moralisation. I can do no more than call attention to a specially good treatment of fanaticism, and to a scrupulously fair and full study of conversion which is held to confirm the results obtained in the earlier parts of the book. It is wbll observed that the idea of conversion-what it is and the con- ditions of it-varies with the idea of grace. Students of the modern French mind ought not to leave unread what M. Delacroix has written on the spiritual history of Claudel, Jammes, and most of all Psichari. A similar study of the progress of doubt in the individual mind- is remark- able for a few absorbing pages about Hyacinthe Loyson. One comes to trust the writer's judgment. His criticism of the theory which derives religion straight from feeling per se is sound, but he misses the point, brought out convincingly by recent scholars, that in Schleiermacher Gefilhl is a mode of apprehensioni, to which reality is given. With cautious wisdom he calls the subconscious " one of the conditions of religion," and will not bs tied down to any single law of the connexion between myth and ritual. Near the close there is given an exceedingly able psycho- logical analysis of the evolution of dogmua. Why do French writers so often issue their books without an index? In a work like this, its absence is a grave defect wh ch is in no sense balanced by a not over full table of contents. We should readily ex- change for it the long list of cited authors, most of whom are anyhow quoted with bibliographical detail in the notes. Inlthese last, no reference is made to Otto's Das Heilige, the most important German book on re- ligion for years. One cannot dlose this very fine book without asking whether some- where or othei the limits of the psychological point of view ought not to have been signalised. The, standpoint of psychology, which must -regard the human nmind as moving simply within itself, is not that of faith. In short, cant psychology give an exhaustive interpretation of faith, any more than of free moral action? H. R. MACKINTOSH. Un Romantisme Utilitaire, Jttude sur le mouvement pragmatiste, Vol. III. By RENx1 BERTHELOT. Paris: F. Alcan, 1922. Pp. 428. This is thA third volume of a work of which the first came out in 1911, and was reviewed by me in No. 82. The first volume dealt with Poincare and Nietzsche, the second was devoted to Bergson, while the third, which appears to be intended as the conclusion, is concerned with 'religious pragmatism in William James and the Catholic modernists,' meaning specifically Loisy, Le Roy, and especially, Tyrrell-who, as before, is systematically spelt ' Tyrrel'. Pascal is, strangely, omitted; but there is an appendix on the 'Catholic Nietzschian,' (i. K. Chesterton! It is a little unfortunate that so extensive aild elaborate a study should have been vitiated at the outset by a theory of its subject, and a method of composi- tion, which render it almost impossible, for M. Berthelot to carry conviction. He began with a notion of pragmatism so vague that it seemed to him apposite to label it ' utilitarian romanticism'. Now this was a signal case of defining obscurum per obscurius. 'Pragmatism' is notoriously used ambiguously, like all philosophic terms, especially by its opponents. The reason is simple; it is a 'blanket' term for describing collectively a number of spontaneous tendencies and philosophic doctrines which have something in common, but are capable, And in need, of being distinguished. M. Berthelot's formula, however, does not improve matters, for it, too, is</page><page sequence="17">NEW BOOKS. 109' vague and ambiguous. 'Romanticism' is much the same sort of term as 'pragmatism,' only more so, while 'utilitarian' is a meaningless mis- nomer, unless, and until, it is elucidated by stating the ends for which the 'utilities' referred to are supposed to be means. M. Berthelot, how- ever, nowhere explains precisely what his label means, though he is con- stantly suggesting that for him ' romanticism' means the German literary movement, and 'utilitarian ', the English form of hedonism, so denomi- nated. It- is no wonder, therefore, that he applies his label to doctrines which are not strictly pragmatism at all, like Nietzsche's, and are more akin to Vaihinger's philosophy of 'fictions'. And as he got deeper into his subject, it became manifest that there were forms of pragmatism to which his formula did not apply, e-.g., Dewey's and Sidgwick's. These, therefore, had to be omitted. But it is really quite as arbitrary to call James a 'romantic' (in M. Berthelot's sense) because he expresses sym- pathy with the 'romatntic' (i.e., personal) interpretation of the coulse of events. I As regards method, M. Berthelot's exposition proceeds on the assumption that philosophies are products of the severest inbreeding. Every later philosophy is traced to the ' influence' of one or more earlier, and nothing is allowed for originality, or personal idiosyncrasy, or cross-fertilisation by scientific and vital problems, although in the present volume he makes some use of biographical material in the case of James and of Tyrrell. "Influence,' moreover, is always taken as attraction, although it is plain that many ideas take shape under the influence rather of repulsion and revolt. The result of his excessive devotion\to tracing influences is that M. Berthelot always seems more interested in the roots than in the fruits of a philosophy, and often starts at sdch a distance from his pQint that he never gets to it effectively. For when, after grubbing endlessly among the roots, he emerges face to face with the man he is studying, he too often fails to recognis&amp; his moss salient features. For example, he discusses at great length the influence which his father's Swedenborgianism, Emerson, and Carlyle- also a 'utilitarian romantic'! (p. 23)-may have had on the origin of James's pragmatism; but he has nothing to say about the more obvious and avowed influence of Chauncey Wright and C. S. Peirce, entirely fails to see the fundamental difference between James's psychology and Associa- tionism, and is blind to his revolt against Spencerian naturalism. But then he has not, apparently, used James's Letters, which came out in 1920. Other defects in M; Berthelot's method are due to tendencies to allege inconsistency where he has failed to apprehend a connexion, to make dis- tinctions and to base on them charges of 'ambiguity,' without showing that they affect and vitiate the argument, and to neglect to clinch a criticism by direct quotations or references. The result is that what might have been an illuminating criticism becomes a work which even the enemies of pragmatism will have to use with caution. M, Berthelot begins his attack on James's pragmatism by observing that James uses it in three senses, (1) for the method of testing 'truths' by consequences, (2) for the theory of knowledge which makes it aim at satisfaction, (3) for a pluralistic metaphysic or religion. But the first of these senses does not necessitate the second, nor the second the third (p. 71). The first sense, moreover, is ambiguous, as the ' consequences' concerned may be purely theoretic, experimental, or 'practical' (i.e., material, social or moral). In the second sense the statement that truth is a value or an end means no more than that it is an ideal, and has no special relation with pragmatism. Moreover, values are irreducibly different and may conflict with each other. HEence pragmatism is merely a confusion (p. 152). As a metaphysic or religion, also, pragmatism confuses an 'ex- perimentalism' and a 'moralism'. But its confusion is not great and</page><page sequence="18">110 NEW BOOKS. fertile, like that of Hegelian thought (p. 186). Nevertheless, M. Berthelot finally admits that pragmatism has been a valuable ferment (p. 397). It has produced a number of ingenious and penetrating theories, and kept closer to the scientific movement and the movement of moral ideas than the traditional philosophy, which was sinking into mere erudition. Nor ~should it be regarded -as philosophic Americanism, for it has shown more strength and originality in Europe (p. 395). M. Berthelot's attack on 'modernism' as an apologetic for Catholicism extends over 200 pages, more than half of which are devoted to Tyrr6ll f(and his 'roots'). Though an anti-clerical-himself, he labours to show that no pragmatism can serve the purppse of Catholic apologetic, because it can never show that Catholicism is the only religion which 'works'. To which a Catholic pragmatist would presumably reply that it was enough to show that Catholicism worked better than any alternative. This objection, however, reveals how far M. Berthelot is from under- standing pragmatism. He has never penetrated to its core, probably because he has never observed man's natural pragmatism, of which philos- ,ophic pragmatism gives the rationale. Religious pragmatism is an excellent example. All religions are spontaneously and unconsciously pragmatic, even though their theologians may theoretically denounce the pragmatism they practice in their devotions. For all religions spring from spiritual needs, and commend and authenticate themselves by appealing to the excellence of the consequences of accepting them. James's epoch-making discovery was simply the observation of this fact. Religion is a general and im- portant psychical fact. But this observation was not merely the founda- tion of a new science, the psychology of religion; it was also a challenge to the old logic. Could it safely be assumed henceforth that this psycho- logical fact was devoid of logical significance ? And if not, how precisely could the truth-value of religion be correlated with its psychological urgency ? Men are still far from agreement on the answers to these questions, and perhaps the reason is not merely that the questions are so new. Yet conscious pragmatism is as great a novelty as ever disturbed the complacent somnolence of an erudite tradition. It bobs up everywhere, -and seems to be hydra-headed. But its various heads all belong to the same monster. M. Berthelot has not encountered them all. He has -omitted, e.g., the very fundamental sense in which pragmatism is a theory of meaning, and insists on the desirability of securing a definite meaning as a preliminary to philosophic discussion. Yet meaning is prior to truth, as even formal logic is being driven to admit. Pragmatism, more- *over, can easily pass from meaning to truth, and from,truth to meta- physics, and if the attraction of human interest is intense enough, there is no reason why it should be driven by logical necessitation. A train of real thinking, as opposed to a verbal concatenation of 'propositions,' is never impelled by any absolute necessity, but always picks its way among alter- matives. If, then, in pragmatism, one of its doctrines can intelligibly lead to another, and if all can appeal to the same method, that of empirical -testing by 'consequences,' and can repudiate dumb 'intuitions' and brute 'necessities of thought,' it makes as good a 'system ' as any. M. Berthelot's 'ambiguities', therefore, are harmless, because irrelevant. 'They do not vitiate an argument which holds of all the 'senses he distin- guishes. It is similarly futile to object that 'experimentalismn' and 'moralism ' are not the same. They are not; but they are connected. It -is the moral need for supernatural support that drives men into experi- menting with religions. It is true also that their d&amp;esires, their demands, their values, and their ends are not identical; they can, and do, conflict. But their very conflicts prove that they have comion ground to fight over, and all conflicts are decided by,the same criterion, the value of the</page><page sequence="19">NEW BOOKS. lII ,consequences, as judged by th-ose who have experienced them. For all agree that of alternatives they must always choose the best.: hence inferior ' truths' are doomed to sink into ' errors,' as better v4lues become available. But this process is not, as M. Berthelot thinks, the destruction of truth ; it gives a real meaning to a term that has hitherto been an empty ab- straction. F. C. S. SCHILLER. Bttudes de Philosophie MJdievale. By ETIENNE GILSON. Strasbourg, 1921. Pp. vii, 291. (English agents, H. Mliford, Oxford University Press.) Prof. Gilson's volume of studies, which concerns itself principally with the great figures of St. Thomas and Descartes, is an admirable proof of the real continuity of European thought and the arbitrariness of the dividing lines commonly drawn between the " mediveal " and the modern. In the first paragraph of the Preface we read that " St. Thomas is the first modern philosopher in the full- sense of the word ". That is, he is the first "Western," (after the rise of Christianity, I presume); whose thought is not in bondage to a dogma or a system of dogmas, The four essays which make up the first half of the book are devoted to the exposition of this thesis. In the first of the four, Le sens du rationatism6 chrftien, a lucid account is given of the point of view of those writers of the early middle ages, notably Scotus Erigena and Anselm, who are often regarded erroneously as " rationalists " in some modern sense because of their anxiety to find an intellectual justification for the whole content of Christian dogma. The point to be made is that their " rationalism " is a point of view which even the most orthodox, of our own day have lost and need to recover with some difficulty befQre we can understand them. Our difficulty, as M. Gilson says (and the same thing would be true of our difficulty in dealing with early Greek thought), arises from our in- ability to forget so much that we know. What we forget, in particular, is that before the time of Albertus Magnus and his pupil Thomas, a Christian " philosopher " had no conception of what we call " nature " as an independent object of study in its own right. Erigena or Anselm starts with the assumption that the proper object of all true scientia is God, the " absolutely perfect being ". Now there are two ways of ascending to the knowledge of God; one is from the revelation of Him by His shadow, the visible world, the other is fromi His infallible utterances in the Scriptures, on which the faith of the Church is founded, and the two revelations, being revelations of the same God, must be concordant, when they are rightly understood. But Scripture speaks throughout in symbol and metaphor, and its true sense is not apparent. The visible world is also a system of symbols of the same divine reality, and these symbols, read aright, are the key to the " true sense " of Scripture. We begin by believing Scripture true as a matter of faith ; what the truth it reveals is, we have to discover by the use of intelligbncee Hence the so-called rationalism of an Anselm means simply the employment of the intellect in exhibiting the complete concordance of the two systems of symbols, those of the visible world, and those of Scripture. This is what is meant by the watchword fides quaerens intellectum. , The object of such a rationalism is simply to show that the faith which we begin by believing as wholly and absolutely true is also the real mean- ing of the symbolism of nature. We do not believe the Faith becalise we have established this result, we feel the duty of establishing it because we are already aware of the absolute truth of the Faith. The second and third studies develop the difficulties which beset a conception of this</page><page sequence="20">112 NEW BOOKS. kind. The second, La servante de la the'ologie, deals with the definite programme the Popes had set before themselves in encouraging the- organisation of the University of Paris as a single centre of higher study for Christendom. The intention was that the " liberal arts " were to be studied just so far as they could be enlisted in the service of Christian theology and no further. The irony of history lies in the development by which this very institution became permeated by the spirit of devo- tion to the pursuit of "philosophy" for its own sake, the study of " nature" on its own account, not as a mere collection of symbols of theological truths. In the third essay, La doctrine de la double ve'rite ,we study the way in which this pursuit of natural knowledge on its own account, under the guidance of Averroes and Avicenna, leads to a final breakdown of the earlier conception of the two concordant revelations - "philosophy," no longer the ancilla theologiae, seems to point to the explicit denial of the cardinal doctrines of all theology. It is an interesting and important thesis of M:. Gilson that the Averroists, Siger of Brabant and the rest, have generally been miscon- ceived. The doctrine of the " double truth " was never formally asserted by them, but was urged by their adversaries as the logical outcome of their position. Their own protestations that they honestly believed the dogmas of the Faith was in most cases probably silncere. With the fourth essay, La significction histor-ique du thomisme, we reach the central thesis of M. Gilson's book. Albertus Magnus and Thomas mark a new era in philosophical thought precisely because they have fully rediscovered nature as an independent object of study on her own account. They represent a final breach with the' Augustinian tradition which lies at the bottom of the earlier so-called "rationalism," and is itself derived, in the end, from the doctrine of aVaALaV7roL in the Phaedo. At bottom the older "rationalism" is based an the Augustinian a pm-orism according to which sense is not really a source of knowledge at all. Even in sense-perception, according to the Augustinian doctrine, sensations are, as in the Phaedo, Inere occasions for the mind to turn to the contemplation of "ideas" it already possesses. It is, strictly speaking, God who, as the light of the intellect, directly furnishes us with all natural knoWledge, just as it is God who directly illumines the mind to believe supernatural truth. Albert and Thomas break wholly with this view of knowledge when, following the lead of Aristotle, they reject every vestige of " innate ideas," and leave the mind, apart from the special workings of supernatural grace, nothing more than a " natural light " which amounts only to a capacity for extract- ing "universals" from the particulars of sense.: This entails fateful consequences for both theology and science. In theology it leads to the sharp distinction between such natural knowledge of God as can be got by reasoning analogically from the effect, the empirical world of nature, to its cause, and the " mysteries of the Faith," which must be believed, but are wholly incapable of any kind of philosophical proof. In philo- sophy it leads to the recognition of the world of nature as the one proper object of human science. The philosophy of Thomas is thus not what it has sometimes been called, an "apologetic ". Thomas goes further tharL the Averroists themselves 'in readiness to insist on the impossibility of establishing the dogmas of religion by reason; to attempt the task, according to him, is to expose the truths of religion to the mockery of the unbelieving, who will suppose that the sophistical reasons the apologist puts forward are the real ground on which he believes. The task of apologetics consequently becomes the modest one of merely showing that the " infidel's " objections to a dogma have no conclusive force. In philosophy, the consequence is that the natural world is made</page><page sequence="21">NEW BOOKS. 113 over to us as a sphere for free and independent study; Thomas has re- discovered nature, and that is the justification for carrying back the history of "modern" philosophy to him. M. Gilson rightly dwells on the point that the, Thomist doctrine was honestly felt by the adherents of the traditional Augustinianism to be fraught with the gravest danger to religion, inasmuch as it seemed to make God almost inaccessible to our understanding, and says with as much wit as truth that 'Thomas was the greatest of " modernists, " the one " modernist " who has really succeeded. After a brief but fascinating study of Campanella as a typical example of the intellectual ferment of the end of the sixteenth century, we pass to three essays dealing with Descartes. The chief of them, which, with the essay on the place of Thomism in history, stands out as central in the whole volume, deals with l'inne'isne cart6sien et la th'ologie. It is a piece of work which no serious student of Descartes can afford to neglect. M. Gilson first makes' it clear that the central interest of Descartes throughout lay in working out a doctrine of Physics on at mathematical basis. This, of course, entailed a breach with Thomism; the doctrine of " clear and distinct ideas," required to justify the central position given to mathematics, is largely a return to something like the Augustinian tradition and the reversion from Thomism has to be justified. The question then arises, what earlier influences may have been at work. in helping to put Descartes on this line of thought, and it is shown that we must look for the answer chiefly to Augustinian features in the doctrine of Suarez, which Descartes would imbibe at La Fl'eche, and to similar tendencies in the group of divines and others who formed his society in early life, e.g., in his friend Mersenne. This important study is followed- by an admirable essay, Descartes, Harvey et lta scolastique, in which the, exact extent to which Descartes' doctrine of the circulation of the blood agrees with Harvey, and the precise points in which scholastic influences lead him to defend an ancient error, are luminously explained. The book ends with an essay which in the same way treats with careful detail the points of contact and of divergence betWeen Descartes' Me'te'ores and the treatment of the same subject by contemporary followers of the school tradition. An excellent remark on Descartes' peculiar bent of mind, for which these two studies give occasion, is that Descartes' indifference to experiment, except where it serves to substantiate a deduction from his "clear and distinct " premisses, is such that he is equally ready to use his premisses to " explain " real facts and to explain "facts " which do not exist at all (e.g., the falsely alleged dilatation of the heart at the moment when it " beats"). The whole volume is written with the clarity char- acteristic of the best French work, and fully documented in the most careful manner. A. E. TAYLOR. La MentalitJ Primitive. Par L. LMvY-BRUHL, Membre de l'Institut, Pro- fesseur A la Sorbonne. Paris: Librairie F6lix Alcan, 1922. Prix 25 fr. net. Pp. iii + 537. THIS book admirably illustrates the anecdotal style in ethnology. To any- one who likes to read masses of traveller's tales, for the most part tern from their proper setting, and strung together on a somewhat thin thread of theory, L6vy-Bruhl's new work presents material of absorbing interest. To others it may appear very long drawn-out, and even dull. The general thesis has already been expounded in the same author's book entitled Les fonctions mentales dacns les societe's itnfe'rieures. It is to the effect that the primitive man's ways of thinking are wholly different fromn ours. Again 8</page><page sequence="22">114 NEW BOOKS. and again the author speaks of the thinking which proceeds in the early periods of social development, as "mystical," "prelogical," not answerable to any of the ordinary rules which he believes govern our own thinking. In the present treatise he develops this hypothesis with particular refer- ence to the primitive notions of causality. He shows how the savage tends to attribute multitudes of daily happenings directly to the operation of powers which we regard as " mystical and occult ". He illustrates this tendency in regard to illness, death, dreams, omens, divinatory practices, rites of ordeal, and the interpretation of accidents, misfortunes and success. He displays the same tendency at work in the common primitive attitude towards a conquering white race, and towards the novelties which the conquerors bring with them. He makes a number of very interesting observations with respect to what he calls " Le misoneisme dans les soci6tes inf6rieures," dealing with the way in which the savage reacts to new customs and ideas, and with how the novel, if it is accepted at all, under- goes change. He writes a special chapter on primitive people and modern notions of medicine. Finally he sums up the whole of his treatment by asserting at the end, as at the beginning, that " la mentalitg primitive est ,essentiellement mystique ". It is pretty clear that by " mystical " Levy-Bruhl does not mean merely confused and difficult to understand, although he certainly believes that primitive mentality merits these terms of description. And he does not mean merely that there is an unusual readiness to attribute events to the direct operation of spirits. He does genuinely believe that primitive thought is bound by different rules from those which govern ours. In particular we, he holds, are dominated by the law of contradiction, but the savage breaks this law continually and most happily, because another rule cuts right across the law of contradiction, i.e. the law of participation. Our rule says that a thing cannot be something and not be that thing at the same time and in the same sense. But the rule of the savage, says Le'vy-Bruhl, considers not simply that such a state of affairs is possible, but that it is just what, happens most commonly of all. Consider, says the author, how the primitive man looks upon sudden death, a fact of which he has abundant experience. Such death may be " caused," as we might say, by a wild animal; and he recounts a large number of cases in which the apparent agent is a crocodile. But the primitive man says that both the crocodile and a sorcerer are responsible. It is not that they merely work in conjunction, but that the one is the other, and yet at the same time is different from the other. Levy-Bruhl finds it exceedingly difficult to understand how the primitive understanding can work in such cases. " Their thought," he asserts, as he considers his illustrations, " is not subject to the same logical necessities as ours. It is ruled, in this instance as in many others, by the law of participation. There is set up between the sorcerer and the cropodile a relation such that the sorcerer becomes the crocodile, without, however, being confused with him. From the point of view of the principle of contradiction one or other of two things is necessary: either the sorcerer and the animal make one person, or else they are two distinct things. But prelogical mentality can find a place for both affirmations at once." In all this " prelogical" seems to mean very little more than "not making sharp distinctions in realms within which we sometimes do make sharp distinctions ". It is possible that when the primitive man, seeing his friend's canoe upset by a crocodile and his friend drowned or eaten, says, " This was done by a crocodile; let us therefore punish the sorcerer," he is no more prelogical than are we when we say "This was done by Philip drunk, let us take it out of Philip sober ".</page><page sequence="23">NEW BOOKS. 115 Dr. Rivers in his paper on The Prnimitive Conception of Death, had no difficulty in showing that some of Levy-Bruhl's earlier illustrations of the savage's disregard of the principle of contradiction break down entirely the moment the primitive notions involved are fully understood. The illustrations in La Mentalite Primitive do not appear to be one whit more convincing. There is another point. When Levy-Bruhl compares primitive with modern he is very apt to pit the common and ordinary member of the earlier group against the rare and unusual member of the later. It is all very well to say that the savage ignores "secondary" or intermediate causes. No doubt he often does this. But so do many of us. The man who is " struck " by lightning can still be regarded as selected by Providence, even though the part played by the lightning is at the same time admitted.' Modern psychology is almost as full of references to "psychic energy " as are ancient practical beliefs of references to con- trolling spirits. It is a curious but indubitable fact that no small amount of recent social and abnormal psychology errs, not in that the primitive or the abnormal are wrongly observed, but in that the modern and the normal are hardly observed at all. In any case to compare the ordinary member of a primitive group with the modern scientific expert at work within his own field is hardly fair to the former. Further, any attempt to analyse the nature of mental processes which characterise a stage of social development may easily fall into error if it is strictly limited to a study of certain special departments of activity. Take this one point of the ignoring of intermediate links in a chain of causation, for example. Even in those realms with which he specially deals, this is hardly as complete as L6vy-Bruhl would have us believe. And when we turn to the practical inventiveness of primitive man in regard to the search for food, the provision of dwellings, and the development of material arts it appears that the savage is about as capable of learning from experience as the best of us. And not only so, but within these realms he learns from experience in very much the same ways as we do. Largely because he learned his lessons, we have a great deal more leisure, and can thus refine his methods and apply them, when we so please, to spheres which the exigencies of his life held him from investigating in detail. But there is a considerable territory yet to be explored. It is possible that some future ethnologist, interested in the odd notions of the present aue, may charge us with mysticism and irrationality, much as L6vy-Bruhl has fastened these characters upon the early man. In fact, as one reads this book one is irresistibly reminded of the caution uttered by Dr. Rivers in his Fitz Patrick Lectures on Medicine, Magic, and Religion. He was dealing with the very same branches of culture which Le'vy-Bruhl has chosen to study in the book under review. " There can," he said, " be no greater hindrance to progress in our attempts to understand, the mind of man of lowly culture than the belief so widely held that his actions are determined by motives having that vague and lawless character ascribed by many to the thought of savage man. I believe there is no single department of social life in which it cannot be shown that this view is false." Such a position granted, Levy-Bruhl's new book may be seen to be a collection of very interesting premisses and of very unsound conclusions. F. C. BARTLETT.</page><page sequence="24">116 NEW BOOKS. The New Idealism. By MAY SINCLAIR. London: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1922. Pp. xvi, 333. Realism, on Miss Sinclair's view, is the metaphysic of mindlessness. If it accepts mind at all, it accepts it as a particular local- development of an unminding process. Idealism, on the other hand, accepts the domin- ance and the centrality of mind. She regards both theories as hypotheses, but one may explain better than the other. They are also, she believes, contradictory, and there is no serious third possibility. Her argument, consequently, attempts the overcoming of realism, and looks to idealism for the appropriate supple- ment and improvement. This idealism, however, she thinks, must be new. The old idealism 'has got to move on or go under,' for these new realists have something to say, and they have said it, too, within the last five years. The greatest of them, indeed, are worthy of devout admiration, and Miss Sinclair acknowledges the fact very handsomely. What is chiefly to be learnt from them is that Space and Time must be taken seriously. Accordingly, after some preliminary skirmishing (princi- pally concerning memory and 'external' relations) Miss Sinclair proceeds to a very full discussion of Messrs. Broad and Whitehead; and after a brush with the critical realists and certain observations on the antinomies, she concludes the first (and longer) part of her book with a fifty-page essay on Mr. Alexander. Miss Sinclair has not spared herself in these enquiries. Her scrutiny is always searching and minute. She keeps up a continuous brisk bombardment with the most pertinacious freshness and pith. She is utterly fearless, too, in meeting these formidable antagonists on their own ground-at any rate so long as they write plain English, for she confesses to a certain nervousness lest Mr. Whitehead should slay her with an equation, and not even let her know how dead she is. Something less than an equation, I think, might suffice for her treatment of the compact series (where she finds nextness camouflaged as betweenness); and there are other misses. Per contra there are many hits. In particular, I should like to see a reply from Mr. Alexander. The general plan of Miss Sinclair's critical argument is to let realism refute itself. What she has to prove, however, is that it refutes itself because it leaves mind out, and although she herself seems always to see quite clearly why its mindlessness is responsible for its many disasters, it may be doubted, often, whether she has any reason to expect that her readers will see it too. Even if there are only two alternatives, an undivided sovereignty of mind and an undivided sovereignty of mindless- ness, it is at least possible that realists, even eminent ones, should some- times contradict themselves flatly, and sometimes talk utter nonsense. If so, it need not be necessary to suppose that nonsense becomes sense, or contradictions non-contradictitous just because mind comes in. It must be confessed, indeed, that the triumphant entry of mind in the reconstructive part of Miss Sinclair's -argument brings something like a shock, despite the lavish hints of her critical preparations. " Conscious- ness secures to events their range in Spice, their hold on Time, their past, their present and their future, in a word, their continuity." "In minded Space-Time, motion becomes once more thinkable." Change and substance become intelligible; the problem of the relation of perspectives to Space-Time loses its " relevance ". This is what consciousness does; and when we come to the categories, an " intrinsic, irreducible selfhood beneath and behind all consciousness " does it, so that the idealist has a " fairly easy " career in this region. And so of a host of other problems.</page><page sequence="25">NEW BOOKS. 117 To be sure, Miss Sinclair does not profess to offer more than a tenta- tive justification of her fundamental thesis that 'the being of things is to be willed, and their appearance is to be known'. Hers is an essay towards the reconstruction of idealism, and therefore it is unfair, perhaps, to expect that her hypothesis could be very closely argued over so wide a field. Still, she has at least one positive suggestion to elaborate-her doctrine of the fundamental distinction between primary and secondary consciousness. This, she thinks, settles the realist's problem -of the relation of mind to its objects: Primary consciousness, she tells us, is the whole block immediately present in consciousness. It is alleged to include space and timle, motion, and all the other categories, all concepts and all the raw material of judgment and reasoning, as well as the profound contemplation of some beautiful thing or of some enthralling idea. Indeed, it seems to include everything which is raw, or engrossing, or taken in its first innocence and the razor blade of analytic thought can only get in between it and the secondary act. This secondary consciousness-" the play of the mind round about its object"-is said to include observation, reflexion and meditation, judgment and inference, believing, disbelieving and opining. It is all logic and all scientific knowledge. Thus radium, before it is discovered, exists as a secondary concept, a hypothesis; discovered, it becomes a primary percept; and yet the whole region of discovery, of objects found and not created, is said to belong to secondary conscious- ness. I cannot think this is clear. So far as I can see, Miss Sinclair's main contention is that a primary process (say of perception or memory) ,cannot either affirm or deny that the object perceived or remembered is mental or non-mental, dependent or independent. This is a question for subsequent reflexion if haply it can be solved at all. In this, I think, she is right, but it seems an inadequate basis for the statements I have quoted, and surely it does not support the following sweeping announce- ment "Once admit that primary and secondary consciousness are and are separable," she tells us, "two distinct though related acts of the undivided self, and you can afford to let both consciousness and the cosmos rip. Holding fast by this distinction you can have all the idealism and all the realism you want." The volume concludes with some brief refilexions on ultimate conscious- ness. It defends God's 'dithyrambic and adventurous character, His eternal wildness,' although on an earlier page we were told that one of God's chief functions was to geometrise eternally about pure geometrical figures which the individual consciousness filled with the hardness and softness, the roughness or smoothness, the colour and richness of its own sensa. We learn also that even God's immanent consciousness is com- paratively unreal, and that only His transcendent consciousness is that which truly is. Finally, as touching His omniscience, it is suggested that while God can know everything, He may not choose to know a great deal. Thus He is saved from hearing wicked old men telling naughty stories in their clubs, and Miss Sinclair deduces a remarkable theological consequence which I shall quote in full. " God," she says, " could know everything, but He only knows what He wills to know. He need not listen to all thosee conversations. It is at least possible that man's crimes and imbecilities and falsehoods are precisely what, God doesn't know. And what He doesn't know, He can't foreknow and so prevent. And if He hasn't foreteen evil, then He is not responsible for it." JOHN LAIRD.</page><page sequence="26">118 NEW BOOKS. La Gueerra Eterna e il Dramma dell 'esistenza. By A. AIJOTTA. Second Edition, enlarged. Naples: Francesco Perrella. Pp. xiv, 296. La Teoria di Einstein e le mntevoli prospettive del mondo. By A. ALIOTTA. Biblioteca Sandron, No. 75. (Milan and Palermo, Naples, Genoa, Bologna, Turin and Florence), 1922. Pp. 120. Prof. Antonio Aliotta, who now holds a chair at the University of Naples and edits tho international philQsophic journal Logos, is well known to English readers of philosophy by his book on the idealistic reaction against science, which received critical notice in MIND, No. 84 by Prof. A. E. Taylor, and (the Englisb translation) by Prof. 0. D. Broad irL No. 93. It is to be hoped that his subsequent developments, as represented in these volumes, will receive as much and as favourable notice. For not only do they exhibit a real and important advance in thought, but also a valuable innovation in philosophic exposition. He has prefaced the second edition of this Guerra Eterna with a very interesting autobiographical sketch of his spiritual development, in which he frankly confesses that he has changed, and means to change so long as he lives. The value of such confessions will be appreciated by all who have ever tried to reconstruct the man be- hind a philosophic system, and have laboriously come to suspect that it is the rule rather than the exception for the logical order of the latter to invert the historical order of the former's psychic development. His con- clusions are usually a philosopher's real starting-point, and his premisses but an after-thought concealing the real character of the system. Now in Prof. Aliotta's development the movement was perhaps always more ap- parent than the system: it finds expression in his lively, eloquent and richly-coloured language, and has carried him from a ' dynamical pantheism' of a more or less conventional type towards a theistic affirmation of divine personality, and now to what is substantially a pragmatic humanism. He has, however, abandoned theism, in consequence of the practical object- lesson in the problem of evil afforded by the War. Loss of belief in theism has not, however, entailed abandonment of belief in immortality. His concluding chapter raises, and discusses in a spirited fashion, the burning question of nationalism or internationalism in the world of ideas. Prof Aliotta takes the nationalist side, though not in an extreme form; but he hardly makes allowance enough for the potency of social tradition in moulding and selectina the minds that are then taken to represent the congenital mentality of the society which exhibits them. This assump- tion may not be seriously misleading in cases where the national temper or traditions are initellectualistic or contemplative, as in Greece and India, and perhaps (much more doubtfully) in Germany: but it breaks down woefully wherever the dominant trend of national life is towards practical activity. For the academic life, which everywhere attracte intellectuals naturally inclined to contemplation, then becomes a haven of refuge for dissenters from the prevalent type, in which they can organise themselves so effectively as to repel all intruders of the more normal temperament. The practically-minded societies thereupon tend to leave their intellectuals alone, listening,- it may be,, politely to their doctrines when they have to, but ignoring them in practice, and putting a low social estimation upon their activities. This is what happens in England and America, where it would be quite mistaken to draw inferences from the tone of academic life to that of society at large, and violent contrasts exist between the theories of the one and the practice of the other. Prof. Aliotta's book on the Theory of Einstein begins with a lucid ex- position of its subject (ch. i.), proceeds to a valuable discussion of scientific truth in relation to the principle of Relativity in chap. ii., discusses its</page><page sequence="27">NEW BOOKS. 119 idealistic interpretations in chap. iii., devotes chap. iv. to the 'degrees of truth' (adopting the pragmatic test of acting on a theory to determine its 'truth'), and considers finally individual visions of the world (ch. v.), the relations between scepticism and pluralism (against Rensi) in ch. vi., and the plurality of the subjects of experience (ch. vii.). F. 0. S. SCHILLER. Language, its Nature, Development and O-igin. By OTTO JESPERSEN, Professor in the University of Copenhagen. London: Geo. Allen &amp; Unwin, Ltd., 1921. In this collection of studies Prof. Jespersen ranges over a wide field. Of the four Books into which the work is divided the first deals with the his- tory of linguistic science-the history of philology would perhaps be a more suitable title; the second consists of a richly-documented account of the child's acquisition of language; the third discusses the causes of change in language; and the fourth the wider question of its general development. The second of these sections will be of great interest to those psycho- logists and educationalists who have recognised the importance of the sub- ject. The acquisition of our first language is'the most brilliant intellectual feat that most of us perform, and our procedure here to a large extent fixes our general mental habits. Thus the amusing mistakes of children have their analogues latQr on in the confusions of philosophers. The little girl here instanced (p. 138), who, hearing her mother say, " I will wash you in a moment," answered, " No, you must wash me in the bath," has often enough been heard in philosophical circles protesting against the spatial metaphor 'in the mind'. Prof. Jespersen rightly points out that a linguist is likely to notice many things in children's speech which would be passed over as un- interesting by even the closest observer among psychologists. It is also true, and this may be said without any reflexion upon Jespersen's valuable labours, that the comparative linguist by himself is likely to miss still more. Greater acquaintance with and a more lively interest in psycho- logical questions among students of language is indispensable if advance is to be secured. For the linguist psychology is too often merely a name for Wundt's volumes. Somewhat similar considerations are suggested by the other sections of the work. The reader who notices (pp. 64, 324) the limitations implicit in Jespersen's conception of a ' science of language,' or studies the problems put forward (p. 99) by way of correction for the narrowness of outlook of which he complains, and many similar passages, will feel repeatedly that the present separation of psychology and logic from linguistics is as unfortunate for the latter as it is for the former. " Breadth of vision is not conspicuous in modern linguistics, and to my mind this lack is chiefly due to the fact that linguists have neglected all problems connected with the value of languages " (p. 99). It should be remembered that Jespersen is nearly alone among linguists in his belief that a return to normative considerations is required if the present un- satisfactory state of linguistic studies (very generally admitted to be unsatisfactory, witness Brunot's great work) is to be remedied. rThus the absence even from so liberated an outlook as Jespersen's of any awareness of, for instance, the kind of problems mentioned in Bertrand Russell's introduction to Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus: the prob- lem as to what actually occurs in our minds when we use language, the problem as to what is the relation subsisting between thoughts, words, or</page><page sequence="28">120 NEW BOOKS. sentences, and that which they refer to or mean, the problem as to what relation, if any, one fact need have to another in order to be capable of being a symbol for that other ;-the entire neglect of all such problems is striking evidence of the exuent to which philosophy and philology require to be brought into communication. But both these disciplines are to-day so elaborate that a mastery of one almost necessarily prohibits any active interest in the other and the dis- advantages of this book as a philosophy of language do not make it less attractive either for the general reader or for the psychologist concerned rather with the odd chance lights which linguistic habits can throw upon mental processes than with the psychology of language itself. I. A. RICHARDS. Thte Foundations of -Esthetics. By 0. K. OGDEN, M.A., I. A. RICHEARDS M.A., and JAMES WOOD, M.A. London: Allen &amp; Unwin. Pp. 94. This book follows the plan of taking various theories of wsthetics in turn and considering them, criticising or appraising, the aiim being " not to bring theories into opposition with one another, but by distinguishing them to allow to each its separate sphere of validity. If verbal conflicts are avoided, there will be seen to be many possible theories of Beauty, not one only, the understanding of which maay help in the appreciation of Art." As fourteen views as to beauty are thus discussed within seventy pages the treatment is necessarily very brief. Croce, for example, is disposed of in two and a half pages, though it should be added that those pages con- tain some acute criticism. The aim of the book seems excellent. Indeed the present reviewer would go further than the authors and maintain that a thoroughgoing at- tempt to show even that every theouy of beauty which has received any notable support has some truth in it, would be of value. The weaknesses of the various theories of aesthetics lie, it seems to me, largely in what they exclude. Nearly every one is true so far as it goes. They err in offering as a complete theory of beauty what is only the emphasising of one aspect-perhaps a prominent one-of vesthetic experience. The book under consideration varies very much both in clarity of thought and felicity of expression. Some passages are remarkably acute, especially a few which show a nice satiric vein, and suggest that one at least of the three writers is capable of writing a better book on wsthetics. As it .is, this volume is more likely to be of value to the general reader who wishes to study aesthetics, than to the psychologist or philosopher. One special characteristic of the book consists of frequent literary quotations. Usually, it is stated, these are meant " to provide a concrete illustration of some critical point discussed in the passage immediately preceding, and are therefore not to be regarded as additional commentary. They are intended mainly as a constant reminder of what the discussion is about, and are given as fully as space permits in order that the reader may have this opportunity of escaping from the scientific language of the argu- ment." I take it the humour is intentional here. There are also fifteeen illustrations, mostly excellent reproductions. For these it is claimed that " each adequately, illustrates one or more of the theories discussed, and it will be obvious that all of them are works of high rank ". In some cases neither the illustrations nor the quotations seem happily chosen: at least I have found it difficult to see what theory was specially</page><page sequence="29">NEW BOOKS. 121 -xemplified by some of the illustrations. And some well-known passages would afford better examples of points under discussion than several of those given. The book is very well printed and produced. C. W. VALENTINE. P'undamental Conceptions of Psychoanalysis. By A. A. BRiLL. George Allen &amp; Unwin, Ltd. Pp. v + 344. The material found in this book is taken from lectures given by Dr. Brill, the chief exponent of psychoanalysis in America, at an elementary course in the department of pedagogics of the New York University. It gives a popular and non-technical account of the Freudian doctrines and as such will prove to be of value to the layman who wishes to gain without much effort some knowledge of the main principles of psychoanalysis. It contains little that is original and indeed one is rather tempted to describe it as an excellent abridged edition of Freud's works, except that it is so amply il- lustrated and extended by examples from the author's own experience. Dr. Bi ill is p6ssimistic-as to the value of psychoanalysis as a therapeutic agent, as it can only be used in special cases, but he maintains that the knowledge gained through it is developing a prophylaxis which will not only diminish nervous and mental diseases but will establish newer methods in our system of education, and it is with this object in view that the book has been written. There is no question but that we are much indebted to psychoanalysis for redirecting attention to the paramount im- portance of the impressions of early life, upon which so much stress is laid throughout the book, and in connexion with which the chapters dealing with the 'only child,-' the harm done by fairy tales, and the selection of vocations, provide much valuable information for both parent and teacher: but the statement " whether the individual will be the so-called normal or abnormal person depends entirely on the nature of these early impres- sions " is rather a shock to anyone who has any knowledge at all of eugenics. Dr. Brill is a wholehearted convert to the Freudian faith and like all converts is full of enthusiasm, shows great ingenuity in his explanations and is quite indifferent to criticism. Consistent dogmatism is the keynote throughout and this was essential perhaps for purposes of exposition in the original lectures, but some note of wvarning to this effect seems necessary when the material is issued as a book to a credulous public, for we meet with many unqualified and extravagant assertions, as fur example, " There probably would be no football games were it not for the fact that the participator expects to see at the event his best girl," and " No one can be in any final sense happy, for what he really wants is some- thing that goes back to infantile life ". We are told that criminals dream eonsiderably less than the average normal person and that this is to be expected because the criminal actuaIly realises many more of his wishes; we are also told that the normal person, who thinks he does not dream, is really one who forgets his dreams, but we are not told how in this respect he is to be distinguished from the criminal. Apart from these criticisms this book, as a simple exposition of the Freudian doctrines, is quite sound and calls for no further comment; but it is disappointingf in that no attempt has been made to make a critical survey of the fundamental conceptions themselves or to trace these con- xeptions to their logical conclusions.

By CAMIL;l FLAMMARION, translated by LATROBE CARROLL. London: Fisher Unwin, 1922. Pp. 371. This is the second volume of a trilogy in which the veteran French as- tronomer, now eighty years of age, has set himself with laudable courage to grapple single-handed with the mystery of death, by scientific, that is empirical, methods. The first volume was concerned with the phenomena regarded as proofs of the existence of the soul ' before death,' the third is to deal with events 'after death,' and the whole will no doubt console some people and irritate others, according to their bias. As regards contents, the book is a mass of, stories of supernormal happenings, strung together with only the most obvious comments and little attempt at difficult theoretic analysis. M. Flammarion, being a well-known man of science, enthusiastic, and not too meticulously critical of the confidences made to him by readers of his former works on kindred subjects, has been an in- dustrious and successful collector; but the quantity of his tales is more impressive than their quality. For though he not infrequently draws on the critically-sifted material published by the English Society for Psychical Research, he usually appears to think that all is fish that comes in to his net, and by no means confines himself to first-hand accounts of recent date. This need not, however, condemn M. Flammarion's method, for a story may be both authentic and important, tbough it is evidentially im- perfect; and to have brought his material up to the highest attainable level of such evidence, by cross-examining the witnesses and verifying their statements wherever possible, would have been more than any amateur could have done: it would have required a permanent organisa, tion like the S.P.R., the like of which does not, as yet, exist in France. Indeed it would appear from M. Flammarion (p. 130) that (in 1899 at any rate) he was not allowed to continue his articles on Psychic Research in the Annales Politiques et Litte'raires because so many of their readers threatened to withdraw their subscriptions, 'on religious grounds'. Even this experience, however, has not led him to reflect on the extraordinary psychological paradox revealed by the traditional attitude towards these questions. From time immemorial the human race has loved to circulate ghost-stories, and shrunk with well-feigned horror from the 'impiety' of verifying them F. C. S.
