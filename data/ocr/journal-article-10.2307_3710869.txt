Camara Indiana University Northwest Discussions of Afro-American religious syncretism in the setting of New World slavery are generally suggestive of structural correspondences between the dominant and minority models, but for the most part their primary focus has been on the official posture of the established churches regarding the religious systems of the slaves, as the major determi- nant in the evolution of African religious culture in the New World. This posture was universally one of opposition and it needs to be considered, but at the same time it yields only a partial insight into the dynamics of syncretism. It is important in this connection to explore more systematically the aspect of structural convergence and divergence between the mainstream religions and the African ones. This essay will contrast mainstream (Catholic, Protestant) and minority (West African) structural features, focusing on the nature of ritual life and religious belief in an attempt to illuminate areas of compatibility and antagonism, and to show the impact that this structural dimension had on the interaction between the Christian churches and West African religious culture. This approach is intended to shed further light on the problem of African cultural influence and retention, not only in the comparison of these two countries, but also in the wider hemispheric context. The main thesis here is that the special character of Brazilian Catholicism aided the preservation of religious Africanisms via a strong structural parallelism between the two models, manifested in syncretism and greater accommodation on the part of the dominant church toward the minority one(s). Evangelical Protestantism in the United States, on the other hand, proved inimical to the continuation of African religious practices due to their structural incompatibility, and to the resulting systematic suppression of African cultural traits by Protestant clergymen. RELIGIOUS ETHICS AND THE WORLD The affinity between Catholic liturgical and sacramental structures and West African religious ritual ' has been frequently mentioned in the literature, but the focus has been almost 1. Despite the pluralization of contemporary African religious experience (Jules-Rosette, 1979:219-229; also, Mbiti, 1970:299-342), the emphasis here is on the interaction between Christian religion and 299</page><page sequence="2">300 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS exclusively on the hagiolatrical aspect, i.e. the correspondence between Catholic saints and African nature gods. In this essay the mainstream religious models are analyzed in the context of Weber's typology of religions of salvation (1968). The specific Weberian distinction employed here is not that which addresses the particular type of religion characterized by a "methodology" for achieving salvation, and which is classified as "ascetic" (1968:541). (This methodology bifurcates into a "world-rejecting asceticism," on the one hand, and "inner-worldly asceticism," on the other. To the latter category belongs all ascetic Protestant- ism). The aim of this analysis is precisely to separate the ascetic religious response from the non-ethical type of religion, which can be done by identifying variations within the conception of salvation itself. Such a procedure would enable us, first of all, to assess more effectively the range of variability within the Christian response, which tends to be regarded in toto as ethically-oriented. Secondly, it makes possible the establishment of structural homologies between such Christian variants and religions of the "primitive" type, such as the religions of the African slaves. The application of the Weberian model, therefore, is not intended to characterize traditional African religious systems, strictly speaking, as religions of salvation, but rather, to unveil the structure of the Catholicism implanted in Brazil by the Portuguese settlers, to contrast that with the evangelical Protestantism of the United States, and finally to identify the areas of commonality and conflict between these Christian systems and the non- Christian ones. The question of salvation in Weber is treated latu sensu, and as such takes into account religious responses that have a magical ethic as well, e.g. the majority of West African religious systems.2 At the outset, we are reminded (1968:527) that the traditional conception of salvation cannot be completely separated from the factor of redemption from worldly "traditional" African religion (Mbiti, 1970:1-7). Thus, there is no attempt to incorporate other types of religions that have emerged on the African continent in recent history, particularly new Christian groups, that exhibit different responses-e.g. millenarian, revivalistic, syncretistic-to modern problems. Tradi- tional African religion is not universal, but bound and limited to each particular tribal group. When transplanted to the New World it certainly exhibited this diversity. Yet it must be emphasized at the outset that, for all the diversity of religious background of the West African slaves, the traditional African religious response unified it with a distinctive theological perspective and certain basic principles and patterns of ritual. As Raboteau states: "Beneath the diversity, enough fundamental similarity did exist to allow a general description of the religious heritage of African slaves" (1980:7). 2. The applicability of the concept of salvation to African religion may be explored in relation to the following aspects. First, the association of traditional African religion with an other-worldly orientation may appear problematic, given the "pragmatic" basis of this religion. Yet traditional African peoples subscribe to a concept of the hereafter, which differs from the Christian one in that it does not imply a sharp separation of earthly life from the hereafter. The idea is that the next world is actually located here, except that it remains invisible to human beings (Mbiti, 1970:208). After death, the departed soul must travel to this region, encountering on this journey various degrees of difficulty, depending more or less on the quality of earthly existence of the deceased. The concern with the afterlife is significantly reinforced by the widespread belief among West Africans in multiple souls (e.g. Barrett, 1976:108). At the same time, there is not, strictly speaking , a clearly identifiable ethical component to the afterlife in the majority of African religions, because the afterlife is seen as a kind of continuation of life on earth (Mbiti, 1970). Thus, the element of salvation is conceivable only in the particular sense of a state of salvation achieved on earth, which continues after death. All things considered, the religious ritual of the West African cult, as manifested through offerings and sacrifices to the gods, might be seen as an attempt to change divine disposition through magical manipulation. This means that an effort is made to avert or eliminate the concrete ills ("divinely appointed inflictions," Weber, 1968:437) that may have befallen an individual or group of individuals. As can be seen, the paths to salvation are broadened so as to embrace the systematization of practical conduct that can either be completely oriented towards the world, or towards the afterlife. The main emphasis is on salvation in whatever form, as long as it has practical implications for behavior in the world (Weber, 1968:528).</page><page sequence="3">AFRO-AMERICAN RELIGIOUS SYNCRETISM 301 suffering (the case of political and economical salvation), nor from the malevolent spiritual forces that may affect our terrestrial existence. Beyond that, two major dimensions of salvation must be examined, the first being tied to expectations regarding another world (other-worldly orientation), and the second to liberation from concrete ills (this-worldly orientation). The first case applies to ethically-based religion, which stresses systematization and internaliza- tion in the direction of an ethic of ultimate ends. The stronger the tendency, the greater the tension between this type of religion and the world. The religious response here is grounded in a "sacred inner religious state," and shows an intensification of the inherent conflict between "the religious postulate and the reality of the world...." A clear example of this response is the evangelical Protestantism of the American South in the historical period under consider- ation. In the second case, the tension between religion and the world "appears in a less consistent fashion and less as a matter of principle" (Weber, 1968;576-578). This tendency is characteristic of "primitive" religion, and it was also present in the Catholicism of colonial and imperial Brazil. A this-worldly basis of salvation promotes the attainment of political and economic goals, whereas an other-worldly orientation de-emphasizes social and psychologi- cal bonds with family and friends, as well as "political, economic, and erotic activities" (Weber, 1968:542). There are a number of aspects explored by Weber that serve to differentiate between this- worldly and other-worldly religion. Two of these are especially pertinent to this study: the distinction between magic and religion, and the question of religious ethics and the world. Regarding the magic/religion polarity, two elements of worship, prayer and sacrifice, will be considered. In the context of magic, prayer has a practical basis, assuming the form of technical rationalization (e.g. as in the use of material devices, such as the counting of rosary beads), and aims at the attainment of economic and political objectives. In this mode of worship, prayer essentially represents a form of manipulation and coercion of the deity, via magical formulae. In the context of religion (i.e. ethical religion), the individual resorts to prayer as a form of supplication, and the latter is mainly geared to "irrational," that is, non- economic or other-worldly, goals. Sacrifice, particularly animal sacrifice, is an integral part of magical worship. Similarly with prayer in this mode, sacrifice embodies the instrumental aspect of transaction ("cool and calculated trading") and magical manipulation. In the more purely religious response, on the other hand, sacrifice springs from non-magical motives, and amounts simply to a tribute or gift to the deity. Naturally, the utilization of prayer and sacrifice in magical and religious worship is effected along a continuum, rather than on the basis of a rigid conceptual and substantive differentiation. Be that as it may, as conventionally under- stood, sacrifice is conspicuously absent from ethically-based religion (Weber, 1968:422-424). As for the issue of religious ethics vis-a-vis the world, the focus will be shifted here to the problem of sexuality. The relationship of all religion to sexuality remains "extraordinarily intimate." This-worldly religions show remarkable affinity with, and incorporation of, the sexual element. In this connection, the "orgiastic ecstasy" does not emerge as an end in itself, but as the outcome of the sexualization (through dance, etc.) of the worship ritual, as a particular element in the process of sanctification. Such a quality of religious eroticism was strongly evident in the Luso-Brazilian Catholicism of the colonial and imperial eras. In contrast, ascetic, evangelical Protestantism has kept a hostile stance towards sexuality, pro- scribing "any eroticism that tends to deify the human creature. " Weber links this phenomenon to the problem of rationality. As he puts it: "Rational ascetic alertness, self-control, and methodical planning of life are seriously threatened by the peculiar irrationality of the sexual act, which is ultimately and uniquely unsusceptible to rational organization" (1968:546, 543, 602-604). The this-worldly features discussed here, to wit, a pragmatic orientation to life, a founda- tion of magic and sacrifice, eroticism in ritual song and dance, were all predominant in the</page><page sequence="4">302 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS West African religious systems of the slaves. More relevantly for this study, in Brazil they were also visible in the mainstream religion, as already indicated. This is interesting since, as a formal Christian belief system, Catholicism might seem on first reflection to be structurally closer to Protestantism in the context of the Weberian categories. Yet, upon closer scrutiny it shows tendencies that align it more directly with a this-worldly orientation. This is why the sui generis character of this religion must be stressed from the beginning, so that a fuller understanding of the dynamics of Afro-Christian syncretism can be gained. THE CHURCH AND THE STATE It is generally known that the Catholic Church in Brazil operated under the considerable influence and control of the Portuguese Crown throughout the colonial and imperial periods (Calogeras, 1963:234-235; Wagley, 1971: Chapter 6; Holanda, 1973:84). This immediately suggests significant formal limitations on the part of the Church to exert a deep and pervasive effect on the masses. However, as concerns the dynamics of retention of religious Africanisms on Brazilian soil, the relative absence of pastoral attention and the level of autonomy of the official ecclesiastical structure vis-a-vis the all-powerful Portuguese Crown are hardly the point. It is true, of course, that the overall influence of the Church on the formation of Brazilian culture was immense, governmental circumscriptions notwithstanding. After all, both the Church and the State aimed basically at "total coverage of the society" (Bruneau, 1982:12). Moreover, the Church-State interaction must be analyzed in terms of the sacred/ secular dialectic, whereby temporal interests prevailed in the convents and in the patriarchal economy at large, and the sacred influence was shown in the prevalence of the clerical element in the social and political elites of the country (Azevedo, 1971:153). More important still, the Brazilian slave was drawn into the familial complex of the Big House in a profound and far- reaching way (Freyre, 1956:369, 307-398; Pierson, 1967), and the religious context of "folk Catholicism" practiced in the patriarchal universe of the plantation, not the orthodox version of Rome, was really what constituted the nucleus of Afro-Brazilian cultural interpenetration. Freyre stresses this point: . . . this domestic, lyric, and festive Christianity . . . that created the first spiritual, moral, and aesthetic bonds between the Negroes and the Brazilian family and its culture (1956:372). The marked absence of formalism and rigidity in the religion of the Brazilian masses; the prevention, via the objective circumstances of geography and politics, of an authoritarian, monolithic Christianity; the cultivation of a syncretistic folk religion which stressed existence, above all else-all of these facilitated the rapprochement between the two religious cultures, in that the Africans also practiced their religion unencumbered by formal constraints, and experienced it in the totality of their daily life. At this juncture, two points may be stressed. First, however strict may have been the governmental regimentation of the ecclesiastical institution in colonial and imperial Brazil, this did not impart an anti-religious or irreligious quality to the society (Simpson, 1978:149). It has already been shown how the folk religion permeated social praxis at the basic level of existence. Secondly, any intercultural contact would have to have occurred in relation to a mutually shared cultural situation, in this case, the domestic Catholicism of the Big House (unlike the situation in the antebellum American South, where cultural separation in the religious sphere was the norm, either in the figure of the itinerant preacher, preaching a</page><page sequence="5">AFRO-AMERICAN RELIGIOUS SYNCRETISM 303 special, made-to-order discourse to the slave population; or in the plantation black preacher, spouting white-inspired religious exhortations to his fellow blacks). This paper carries the argument further by suggesting that the African was not only deeply enmeshed in this religion, but also found in it a fertile terrain for syncretization and retention of his/her own native heritage. Of course, Brazilian Catholicism as a whole differed in several aspects from the official version of Rome. In this sense, "public" and "private" religion-the private type being the localized familial Catholicism of the plantation-had essentially the same dialectical basis: ritualistic and mystical on the one hand; experiential, practical, and given to magic on the other. Stated differently, it was a dialectic that opposed and unified the concern with the business of saving souls and that of integrating diverse cultural elements. Yet, the crucial point is the familial integration that underlay the wider process of cultural fusion. By realizing that formal Catholicism was subordinate to the family institution in an even more significant way than to the State, and that folk Catholicism itself exerted a systematic influence over the church (Bastide, in Smith and Marchand, 1951:36; see also Azevdo, 1958:21), greater insights can be gained into the phenomenon of Afro-Brazilian religious exchange. CATHOLIC SAINT VS. WEST AFRICAN ORISHA; THE POSITION OF THE CHURCH The tolerance/intolerance of the dominant religions in the New World societies regarding the slave culture must not be assessed solely in reference to the traditional hostility of dominant cultural models towards minority ones. To be sure, the top echelons of Catholicism and Protestantism officially advocated the quick and large-scale Christianization of the Afri- cans from the earliest stages of the slavery era, and opposed the "heathenism" of their religious ways out of a sense of duty and in-group affiliation. But there was often a gulf between dogma and practice (Bastide, 1978), as we saw to be the case in Brazil especially, owing to the geographical and political problems faced by the Church. The fact remains that in the Luso-Brazilian context we have a clear indication of how the greater Catholic tolerance vis-a-vis non-Christian cultures had less to do with administrative procedure that with struc- tural affinity with West African religious practice. During the greater part of the slavery period, Africans all over Brazil were allowed to hold their native festivals and ceremonies, usually in conjunction with traditional Brazilian celebra- tions. The African religious traits that were most acceptable were those which had counter- parts in the Catholic ceremonial, such as the national kingships and tribal chiefhoods (Bastide, 1978:54; Freyre, 1956;472). The congada exemplifies this religious syncretism. It was the symbolic coronation of the King of the Congo, and it was incorporated into the yearly festival of Our Lady of the Rosary, who became a patroness of the blacks (see Koster, 1966; 136, for a vivid, first-hand account of this celebration). Other foreign observers, such as Ewbanks (1856), who lived in Brazil in the mid-1800s, noticed the extensive black participation in the church festivals, like those of the Holy Ghost, Good Friday, and Palm Sunday. James Wetherell, British consul at Bahia in the 1840s, saw the procession of the Holy Ghost being accompanied by African drums (1860:30). He also noticed that multitudes of blacks congregated at the majestic Our Lord of Bonfim Church during Catholic feasts, and put on a public spectacle of African dances, which he typically interpreted in moralistic fashion as a scene of "the wildest debauchery" (1860:122). The fertile conditions for cultural fusion appear to have shaped the Catholic reaction to the African cultural presence far more than official decree. Whenever the opposition of the Church made itself felt, this had to do with the conventional antagonism between the estab-</page><page sequence="6">304 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS lished cultural community and the minority groups, but it could be significantly intensified/ weakened by the structural relationship between all these groups. In the case of the United States (and the British West Indies as well), the vigorous attack on African "heathenism" by Protestant missionaries seems to have been directly motivated by conflict between evangelical theology and African religious practice. In any event, as pointed out earlier, even if the official Catholic position is made the focal point of the analysis, the chief church-related influence on slave culture on the Brazilian plantation was that of the resident chaplain, whose actions were in turn far more subordinate to the authority of the paterfamilias of the Big House than to the Roman See; and whose involvement with the domestic religion of the plantation was much deeper than his affiliation with the orthodox model of Rome (Freyre, 1963b:70; Bastide, 1978:40-42).3 WEST AFRICAN RELIGION AND LUSO-BRAZILIAN CATHOLICISM The potentialities for syncretism between Catholicism, as practiced in Brazil, and the religious systems of the slaves can be better assessed at this point by listing the major features of traditional African religion, in terms of concrete aspects (content) and structural tendencies (form): (A) Elaborate ritual and sacramental structures (see Landes, 1940; Herskovits and Herskovits, 1942; Herskovits, 1956k; Mbiti, 1970). (B) Magic and divination-this figures prominently in the whole of existence of the African, and comprises the use of, and belief in, charms, amulets, and the like. (C) The cult of the dead-according to Bastide, this religious phenomenon is "deeply rooted in the moral code and the civilization of all the peoples of black Africa" (1978:128). Herskovits adds that the ancestral cult in Africa "is the most important single sanctioning force for the social system and the codes of behavior that underlie it" (1964:300), becoming a length "one of the most important cults . . . in all of West Africa" (1966:85). (D) Polytheism-a basic feature of West African religion is the notion of a High god or Supreme Being, creator of all things (Mbiti, 1970:37). The exalted status of this supreme deity, however, precludes a direct involvement in the ordinary daily affairs of human beings. This becomes the sphere of responsibility of a pantheon or group of lesser divinities and ancestor-spirits. Through these spiritual beings God manifests Himself and controls "major objects or phenomena of nature" (Mbiti, 1970:98). (E) Sacrifices and offerings-the sacrificial element stands among "the commonest acts of worship among African peoples" (Mbiti, 1970:75). It is certainly part and parcel of the rituals of African cults in the New World, regardless of their particular ethnic derivation. (F) Direct deity-devotee relationship-an essential function of the African nature gods is that of mediating between individuals and God. This is so because one cannot approach the High God directly or personally, as already mentioned. Mediation occurs in various forms, such as sacrifice, divination, and spirit possession (Raboteau, 1980:11). In addition to the mediating aspect, ancestor spirits and specific deities become personal gods and the source of selflhood and identification, as well as protection, for each member of the group (see Durkheim, 1965, Book II, for a discussion of this phenomenon). This can be exemplified in the Yoruba cult ritual, when the various deities (orishas) "arrive" and "take possession" of their human intermediaries. Mbiti adds that ancestor spirits act as "guardians of the family 3. In many cases, the chapel was an appendage of the Big House, as were the chaplain's quarters (see, e.g. the floor plan of the Nonrega plantation, in Freyre, 1956:469).</page><page sequence="7">AFRO-AMERICAN RELIGIOUS SYNCRETISM 305 affairs, tradition, ethics, and activities" (1970:108). (G) Hierarchy of power-African deities are differentiated on the basis of their ontologi- cal attributes, jurisdiction over natural phenomena (e.g. rain, thunder), as well as social activities and experiences (e.g. war, diseases) and their male/female personification (Mbiti, 1970:98). (H) No formal separation between the sacred and the profane, between the spiritual and the material. Mbiti states that in African societies religion "permeates into all departments of life so fully that it is not easy or always possible to isolate it" (1970:1). It must be added here that traditional African religious expression is generally inseparable from musical expression (singing and dancing). (I) Pragmatic orientation-on the whole, African religions are geared to the resolution of earthly problems and to the achievement of earthly objectives. Accordingly, patterns of worship are characterized by instrumentality and magical manipulation, e.g. the offering of foods to the nature gods. (J) Collectivism-traditional African religion does not involve an ethically-based, per- sonalized religious experience. Instead, it is a collectivistic, communal affair. In African society one cannot dissociate himself/herself from the religion of the group, any more than from his/her " . . . roots . . . foundation . . . context of security . . . kinship . . . and the entire group of those who make him aware of his own existence" (Mbiti, 1970:3). From a comparative standpoint, the simpler rituals of the evangelical Protestant churches in the United States, those which drew the largest numbers of blacks into the Christian fold, conflicted with the complex ceremonial structure of African religion, whereas the pomp and display of the Catholic liturgy gave the Africans a basis for identification and correspondence. This fact did not escape the observation of the Protestant clergyman James Ramsay, who reported in the 1700s for the West Indies: It must be owned, indeed, that the Romish mode of worship consisting of pomp and ceremony, is better calculated to strike, at first sight, the imagination of ignorant people, than our simple ritual (1784:275). The Rev. Phillipo, a Baptist missionary in Jamaica, conceded that Catholicism probably stood a better chance than Protestantism in gaining converts among the slaves because of "the influence which pageantry and show ever exert over the untutored mind" (1969:244). In the United States, Olmsted noted that the more formal liturgical structure of the Church of England, with its "ceremony and pomp, the frequent responses and chants. . . ," was in fact "admirably adapted" to the African character (1856:123). The same could be said for the complex ritual of the Catholic Church. This level of cultural correspondence can be more readily understood via the examination of the brand of Catholicism transplanted to Brazil by the Portuguese. As suggested earlier, this was not the rigid Catholicism of the Tridentine reforms, with its strong emphasis on dogmas, the sacraments, and orthodoxy of beliefs and practices. Rather, it was a late-medieval religious model, which had been deeply affected by centuries under Moorish influence; a religion, as Bastide tells us (in Smith and Marchand, 1951:334), "softened by North African sensuality and Moslem voluptuousness, but that made place for the saints of the Reconquest, knights caparisoned in iron and with lace in hand:. Additionally, it was a cultural rather than a spiritual ideology, with a greater impact over the social than over individual life (Coutinho, 1943:190). It is not surprising, then, that one would also find a carnal, paganistic quality to this Catholicism. As Freyre (1956:30) describes it, we are dealing here essentially with</page><page sequence="8">306 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS . .. a soft, lyric Christianity with many phallic and animistic reminiscences of the Pagan cults. The only thing that was lacking was for the saints and angels to take on fleshly form and step down from the altars on feast-days and disport themselves with the populace. As it was, one might have seen oxen entering the churches to be blessed by the priests; mothers lulling their little ones with the same hymns of praise that were addressed to the infant Jesus; sterile women with upraised petticoats rubbing themselves against the legs of St. Goncalo D'Amarante. It is also reported that in the 19th century women of patriarchal families of planters who had settled in the city would often buy articles from itinerant merchants, including "rosy- cheeked" images of St. Anthony which became "objects of fervent devotion and, in certain cases, of practices of sexual fetishism" (Freyre, 1963a:32). And the cult of St. John had a basis that was "essentially aphrodisiac, and sexual songs and practices are bound up with his rites" (Freyre, 1956:254). This element of paganism is part of the larger tendency of all folk religion to mix the sacred with the profane. This tendency was evident in the Portuguese tradition of including masked dances and profane singing in festivals of the Church, a custom which remained in vogue as late as 1855 (Bastide, 1978:124). Boxer writes about the "gaily and richly decorated religious processions, with their masqueraders, musicians, and dances" in colonial Bahia, and points out that Portuguese Catholicism tended to "blend the sacred and the profane together in the most intriguing ways" (1964:134). This tendency was particularly widespread in the colonial period (before 1808). The French traveller Le Gentil de la Barbi- nais must have been much scandalized by the Christmas festivities and the feast of St. Goncalo d'Amarante which he witnessed in the churches and convents of colonial Bahia; veritable pagan festivals, with much dancing and revelry, in which clerics, noblemen, top government officials, blacks and prostitutes enthusiastically participated (cited in Freyre, 1956:256-257; Boxer, 1964:134). There is also the report by Tollenare (1956:135) who in the early 19th century saw young men and women dancing nightly at the St. Goncalo Church in Olinda (state of Pernambuco), not without some objection from the clergymen, who sensed that European visitors would surely see in that custom something much too indecent to be witnessed in the house of God. With the advent of the imperial era in Brazil in 1808, this phenomenon showed no apparent signs of decline, judging from the continued reports of observers. John Maw noticed in the Southern province of Sao Paulo in 1809 that religious festivals usually ended with "tea, card games, and dances. " While traveling through the province of Para in the 1840s Kidder also lamented that religious festivities had to be carried out amidst "amusements and follies" (1845:297). As late as the 1880s the Feast of The Purification was followed by "a great ball [which] . . . was kept up till midnight" (Dent, 1886:147). The Rev. Walsh, in residence at Rio de Janeiro in the 1820s, was appalled to see that even many of the religious celebrations and services were attended "with the levity of a puppet-show, and without the slightest regard to solemnity or decorum" (1830:387). It should be further stressed, in this regard, that the treatment of the religious (spiritual) and the secular (material) as undifferentiated elements is one of the most important structural features to bring into focus here, as we attempt to sketch the homological relationship between Luso-Brazilian Catholicism and West African religions. As in traditional African societies, Brazilians did not centralize their religion in the temple and in the sacraments, to the exclusion of the world outside this formal sphere. Instead, religion permeated the daily round of life and was never allowed to take precedence over the exigencies of everyday existence. In the rural setting, the sacred structures of the Church and the familial aspects of the domestic religion of the Big House became intertwined most intensely; on the one hand, the formalism of religious dogma; on the other, the contextuality of familial existence, which is to say, life, in its more fundamental sense, attenuating the rigidity of the former, breaking down the sharp distinctions</page><page sequence="9">AFRO-AMERICAN RELIGIOUS SYNCRETISM 307 between the sacred and the profane (see, e.g. Azevedo, 1958:69). In the particular case of Brazil, this phenomenon also pointed to the larger integration of the affairs of the State and those of institutional religion. Since an all-powerful state dictated the norms for social action in Brazilian society, and since it also upheld vigorously the model of a Catholic existence for all the citizens, there was no need for religious commitment to be expressed in terms of a personal involvement with religious ethics. One simply had to be integrated into the main- stream of Brazilian cultural life to display the behaviors and attitudes associated with Catholi- cism. Hence, the frequent observations by foreign visitors in colonial and imperial Brazil on the emphasis which the population imparted to the external manifestations of the cult, along with a marked lack of solemnity and seriousness during religious services (e.g. Walsh, 1830:387; also see Bruneau, 1982: chapter 1). This specific dimension of Luso-Brazilian Catholicism, i.e. the emphasis on pageantry and festivity, was yet another source of cultural identification for the Africans, owing to their own tradition of observing sacred days and festivals, and penchant for ceremonial elaboration. It was also a carry-over from the Portuguese heritage which emphasized, as Boxer informs us (1964:134), "the external manifestations of the Christian cult." In Brazil this reached such proportions as to cause Fletcher to affirm in the mid-1800s that Catholicism there "in pomp and display . . . is unsurpassed even in Italy" (1879:140). He gives a good account of the religious processions and festivals which he saw in Rio de Janeiro, with the multitudes of the faithful, the pyrotechnic displays, the ringing of bells, the gown-clad dignitaries of the Church and government, the ornamentation of the churches and the images of saints, the bands (1979:ch. IX). Caldcleugh (1825:71-72) reiterates this scenario. "If the quantum of religion existing in a country," he states, "were to be measured by its external signs, no country could possibly possess more than Brazil" (see also the chronicles of Rugendas, 1976:126; and Mawe, 1978:69-72). Luso-Brazilian Catholicism also contained the pervasive Portuguese belief in, and prac- tice of, witchcraft and sorcery. The settlers had brought with them a religious mentality as intensely superstitious as that of their African slaves. The reports of foreign visitors repeatedly highlight this aspect, especially those of the Protestant clergymen. Rev. James Fletcher was offended in his Calvinist sensibilities by what he described as "the marriage between heathen- ism and Christianity," in Rio de Janeiro in the mid 1800s. He saw people in that city offering votive tablets at the altar of their favorite divinity or saint for a recovery from various ailments, just as the ancient pagans had done centuries before. They also offered representations in painting and sculpture of various portions of the afflicted body. "In the Gloria Church," he writes, "may be seen any quantity of wax models of arms, feet, eyes, noses, breasts, etc." (1879:95). The same phenomenon was witnessed by Kidder in a convent in the northern province of Maranhao in the 1840s (1945:244). Fletcher describes another practice that was equally widespread during religious festivals: . the faithful (and others for that matter) can obtain any amount of pious merchandise, in the shape of medidas andbentinhos-pictures, images and medals of saints and of the Pope, etc. These are "exchanged"-never sold-in the church, and fetch round prices. A medida is a ribbon cut to the exact height of the presiding Lady or saint of the place of worship. These, worn next to the skin, cure all manner of diseases, and gratify the various desires of the happy purchasers'. . . Bentinhos are two little silken pads with painted figures of Our Lady, etc., upon them. These are worn next to the skin, in pairs, being attached by ribbons, one bentinho resting upon the bosom and the other upon the back. These are most efficacious for protecting the wearer from invisible foes both before and behind (1879:98-99).</page><page sequence="10">308 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS Kidder (1845:292) saw a great many of these bentinhos as well as beads, crosses, and miniature images for sale, hanging on the door of the Santa Anna church, in the Para province, after having been properly blessed, or sprinkled with holy water. Ecclesiastical wares were often peddled through the newspapers, in connection with a forthcoming feast of the Church. Another centrally-important characteristic of this religion was the cult of the dead, as suggested by this passage from Abel du Petit-Thouars, who saw the following scene in the province of Santa Catarina in 1825: . . . I saw at the rear of the room a platform on which an infant was arranged on an altar, surrounded by lilies and vases of flowers; its face was uncovered and it was richly dressed, with a crown of forget-me-nots on its head and a cluster of them in its hand. Around the altar on which this dead child rested, women were kneeling on mats, singing, after which "there were gay dances" (cited in Freyre, 1963:58). At about the same period Walsh witnessed the practice in Rio churches of keeping the bones of departed ones in cases or boxes, which were then encased into receptacles in the walls of the cloisters. Underneath these boxes, gaudily ornamented shrines were erected, where people prayed (1830:336-337). Ancestor worship was especially noticeable in the Catholicism of the plantation which, as Bastide reports, became a sort of household religion, based on "the worship of the patriarch's guardian saints and of the family dead, who were buried in the same chapel and surrounded by the same reverence" (1978:41). But it also prevailed in the urban context, in institutions such as the "confrarias" or "irmandades" (confraternities or brotherhoods), where much of the syncretic process took place. In Brazil (as in Cuba; Klein, 1969), these agencies came to play a vital role in the social and cultural life of blacks, slaves or freedmen. As early as 1589 the Jesuits in Brazil founded religious organizations for the slaves, the "confrarias," among which stood out the "Confraria das Almas" (Confraternity of the Souls), based on the characteristic Portuguese devotion to the souls in Purgatory (Leite, 1938).4 In the area of hagiolatry, the functional equivalence of the Catholic saints vis-a-vis the West African pantheon was direct and multifaceted, providing a solid basis for the syncretic process. The following points are pertinent: (a) both the Catholic saints and the African "orishas" had anthropomorphic attributes; (b) in the Portuguese religious folklore certain saints, like their West African counterparts, were associated with the control of natural forces, such as Santa Barbara, who was thought to be a protector against lightning. Thus, an immediate correspondence was established with Shango, the Yoruba deity of the thunderbolts (see Pierson, 1967:307); (c) Catholic saints also functioned in accordance with a hierarchy of power, in similar fashion to the West African orisha. In Bahia, for example, our Lord of Bonfim is considered the most powerful and important Catholic saint by the lower classes, and thus becomes identified with Oshala, the greatest of the Yoruba orishas (Pierson, 1967:306); (d) the worship of the saints in Brazil had a strongly pragmatic basis, and was linked to the attainment of material goals, just as in Africa; (e) the faithful in Brazil developed a strong bond and identification with a personal deity, and the latter could be not only their guardian angel but also a particular saint to whom they might have been consecrated in infancy. This deity would provide protection as well as help in the solution of earthly problems. This was homologous to the individual-deity relationship in Africa; (f) also, the profusion of saints which were venerated in colonial Brazil may be seen as a parallel phenomenon to West African 4. Bastide (1978:54) writes of the revitalizing effect that the brotherhoods had, through accommodation and syncretism, on the African religious institutions.</page><page sequence="11">AFRO-AMERICAN RELIGIOUS SYNCRETISM 309 polytheism (this type of parallelism is also suggested in Weber, 1968:518).5 Finally, as much as this was a religion "impregnated with mysticism" (Azevedo, 1971:148), Luso-Brazilian Catholicism was not mystical in the contemplative or illuminative sense (Weber, 1968:544-545), nor was it, for the most part, particularly as practiced in the sugar cane and cotton producing regions of the Northeast, and the coffee regions of the South-brutally or tragically mystical, like the Catholicism of Spain and the Spanish colonies in the New World. It was, instead, a softer and more malleable system, possessing "neither inflexibility of dogma nor puritanism of conduct" (Bastide, in Smith and Marchand, 1951:336). As such, it also mirrored the West African example of non-ethical, pragmatically- disposed religion, by emphasizing feeling over abstract principle, by adapting to political and economic circumstance, by having negligible ethical impact over individual or collective action. This utilitarian quality was grounded on a cost-benefit approach to religion, whereby the satisfaction of immediate needs was attained via magical instrumentality. The mechanism of indulgences, the buying of masses for the departed, etc., represented an economic transac- tion through which special favors from the Church could be granted. "The iniquity of indulgences still obtains," deplored Dent (1886:278), during a period of residence in Brazil in the 1880s. Koster (1966:115) tells us about the cult of our Lady of the 0 (in the Recife area in the early 1 800s), "an avaricious personage, whose powerful intercession is not to be obtained unless she is in return well paid for her trouble. " Similarly, in the African religious context, as befitting the model of "primitive religion," the offering of entreaties and gifts to the various deities aimed not at ethical reparation or an increased awareness of sin; instead it constituted a form of practical exchange, of "calculated trading," to use Weber's term (1968). Herskovits (1944) has noted how devotees in the African cults at Bahia may seek to gain special favors from the cult priest by offering him a new ceremonial drum. WEST AFRICAN RELIGION AND CALVINISTIC PROTESTANTISM This essential property of Luso-Brazilian Catholicism, namely, greater structural com- patibility and overall potential for syncretization with West African religion, has been intro- duced as a determining factor in the process of African religious retention in Brazil. In analyzing Protestantism in the United States the primary focus will be on this aspect also, but the thesis here is that the Protestant influence on African secular and sacred customs was almost always a negative one. Given the structure of dogma and ritual of evangelical Protes- tantism, the latter could only react adversely to the aboriginal religious behavior of the slaves. The vigorous and unceasing attempts on the part of missionaires to suppress this behavior demonstrate this fact. In order to clarify the dynamics of this suppression, it is important at this point to examine some of the basic tenets of Calvinism, an ideology which had a deep and pervasive effect on the evangelical sects of the United States, both as a source of doctrinal authority and an ideological model shaping the basic attitude of the faithful towards the world. As Jordan (1968:199) points out, the similarities among the Protestant sects "were fully as important as the differences," and nearly all of them "shared in common a low-church English Protestantism strongly tinged by Calvinism." Among these sects the Baptists and 5. The structural homologies between the ritual structures of Catholicism and those of West African religion gave rise to what Herskovits calls the "disguise technique" (1972:254), consisting of the slaves' frequent use of Catholic ritual and statues of saints as a cloak for their own religious exercises. This was done in order to trick their more religiously-minded masters into believing that what was actually taking place was Catholic worship (for descriptive detail of the Catholic saint-African nature god correspon- dence, see Bastide, 1978:260-284).</page><page sequence="12">310 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS Methodists exerted the strongest and most consistent influence on the slave population of the South, and they were, according to Raboteau (1980:130),clearly in the ascendancy in that area starting in the late 1700s. It is true that the Baptist and Methodist denominations are not generally associated with Calvinism, and that the latter more properly provides the theological basis for the Presbyterian and Reformed churches. Some facts must be noted, however. The Baptist doctrine is said to have come into being as an offshoot of English Congregationalism in the early 17th century (Hudson, 1982:209, Vol. III); yet it soon split into separate factions, the General Baptists and the Particular Baptists, which followed a moderate (Arminian) and a more orthodox version of Calvinism, respectively. It has, in fact, been asserted that the history of the Baptist Church "has been characterized by an emphasis that has varied from a strong to a moderate Calvin- ism" (Hudson, 1982:210). These Calvinistic tendencies were especially evident in the fron- tier churches of the U.S., leading to the appearance of groups such as the Primitive ("Hard Shell") Baptists (Hudson, 1982:212). Hays and Steely point out that from the late 1700s on the Particular Baptists prevailed over all other Baptist branches both in size and in influence, and their dominant position was "strongly Calvinistic" (1973:160). As for Methodism and Calvinism, if their more specific doctrinal differences are left aside, one finds that they shared a remarkably similar moral outlook, the same basic attitude of rejection of the world, particularly as concerns the element of greatest relevance in any study of African culture: musical and recreational activity, as it is woven into the structure of religious ritual. Like pietistic Calvinism, Methodism regarded "all worldly delights at the least with distrust, at the most with rather violent aversion" (Cameron, 1961:218). This denouncement of worldly diversion was pursued with increased vigor by Wesley's followers. The spirit of self-denial went from its original character as an adjunct to a religious philosophy to become "the goal itself' (Cameron, 1961:218). Among the wide range of terrestrial amusements opposed by Methodism, dancing was "the most severely reprobated" (Cameron, 1961:222). In view of the crucial role played by dancing in the spectrum of African religious life, the significance of this position cannot be overstressed. Be that as it may, the quick and vehement rejection of African religious manifestations by Protestant clergy was not in principle limited to any one particular denomination, although it was far more conspicuous, by virtue of historical circumstance, among the Methodists and Baptists. This suggests that this recriminatory attitude had less to do with the specific doctrinal content of the Protestant sects involved (the variation in content was considerable), and much more to do with theform of their religious response. Thus, the religious manifesta- tions of the African slaves must have appeared, as judging from numerous reports of 19th century ministers, equally alien and intolerable to all sects, uniformly contrary to the Protes- tant orientation as a whole. From this point of view, the doctrinal stipulations of Calvin and his specific reservations regarding the Catholic Church appear to have had an important and far reaching effect on evangelical Protestantism considered in toto, and to have been pertinent to the attitude of Southern clergy toward the religious expressions of the slaves. The dispute between Methodists and Presbyterians over the question of predestination, for example, is not as important here as the fact that all of the evangelical sects alike emphatically disavowed worldly entertainment, material representations of the faith (statues, offerings, amulets, etc.), religious intercession and intermediaries, and so forth. In this sense, they all displayed the same fundamental "moral conduct" (Weber, 1958:96), the same predominant tendencies of aversion to the world (manifested objectively in the repudiation of secular entertainment); of absolute individualism which rules out all religious intercession; and of stressing the absolute transcendentality of God and the corruption of all that was related to the flesh, implying an entirely negative attitude towards all the sensuous and emotional elements in culture and religion (the latter one, for instance, in magic, idolatry, etc.). In Weber's words, this was "a</page><page sequence="13">AFRO-AMERICAN RELIGIOUS SYNCRETISM 311 fundamental antagonism to sensuous culture of all kinds" (1958:105). To the extent that Calvinism provided a basis for the tendencies described above, it constituted a "theoretical attitude toward the world" (Weber, 1968:578), a metatheory which bound together evangelical Protestants of various denominations and formal affiliations. In a similar vein, it can be said that, like the domestic Catholicism of the Brazilian Big House, Calvinism in the U.S. South operated much more as a climate of feeling that affected Protestants of all stripes and persuasions, rather than as a formal philosophical system. We can look more closely at the adversary tendencies of Calvinism towards the world via an examination of Calvin's central viewpoints, as expressed in his landmark opus, Institutes of the Christian Religion (1936). Various aspects of worship and Christian life are discussed; they are subsumed, however under the more englobing structures which make up the Calvinis- tic theoretical attitude towards the world. Reformist religion directed its initial impetus against the Catholic Church because of the latter's insistence on the hierarchy of ecclesiastical authority, complex ritual and sacramental structure, prayers for the dead, and the veneration of the saints. In the "Institutes" Calvin vehemently repudiates all of these Catholic elements. "Romanism" is seen as satanic, its doctrine a "fatal pestilence of souls" (1936:36), where the worship of God "is deformed by a multifarious and intolerable mass of superstitions" (IV, ii, 2). His criticism of the sacramental structure is particularly severe. Although the sacraments are holy exercises for the renewal and solidification of faith in God, they must be administered with the "due decorum" (IV, x, 29). In the hands of the "Papists," however, they become transformed into "degenerate rites" (IV, xiv, 19) and a "gross profanation of the Divine mysteries" (IV, xiv, 4). The Mass, Catholicism's foremost liturgical expression, offers "an intolerable . . . insult to Christ" (IV, xviii, 18), and is "full of every species of impiety, blasphemy, idolatry, and sacrilege" (IV, xviii, 18). All of the Catholic ritual is seen as burdened with an excess of "pageantries, ceremonies, and gesticulations" (IV, xviii, 20); what is more important, it is often conducted in an arcane and inscrutable manner which escapes the comprehension of the faithful. Without the essential mediation of the Spirit, these sacraments are ultimately nothing "but a vain appearance of splendour" (IV, x, 29). The use of images in the temples is classified as idolatrous worship. "All knowledge of God sought from images," maintains Calvin, "is corrupt and fallacious" (I, xi, 5). True religion demands that God be worshipped through no anthropomorphic representation of Himself, and it is cause for great dismay that people should be afflicted with "such brutal stupidity, as to be desirous of visible representations of the Deity" (I, xi, 1). Furthermore, "the Lord prohibits every representation of Him, whether made by the statuary, or by any other artificer, because all similitudes are criminal and insulting to the Divine Majesty" (I, xi, 4). The veneration of saints is subject to equally harsh condemnation. Calvin regards as superstitious the practice by which people's souls are wrested away from the true God and "carried about after various deities" (II. viii, 16). The two aspects of veneration which are relevant here are the visible representation of saints in the form of graven images and intercession, or the use of saints as mediators between the individual and God. As we have seen, the usage of images in itself is deemed ignominious by Calvin. Not only is it abhorrent to God to be worshipped via a a material representation of Himself, but it is an even greater crime to divide His glory by adoring "a multitude of inferior deities" (I, xii, 1). Intercession, according to Calvin, is another theological absurdity, bordering on insanity, inasmuch as the saints themselves must procure access to God Almighty. Christ alone is the Mediator and Intercessor, and the attempt to secure God's blessings through any other channel is unlawful. As Calvin states it: "The office of intercession . . . is peculiar to Christ . . . and no prayer is acceptable to God, unless it be sanctified by this Mediator" (III, xx, 27).</page><page sequence="14">312 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS Tied in with this attack on the veneration of saints is Calvin's wider reprobation of polytheistic beliefs. He summarily rejects the idea that God's honors be distributed among other deities. That the saints, long departed from terrestrial existence, should be worshiped and celebrated in a fashion which befits only the Divine Power, is an abomination which sullies the glory of God to the utmost. A final comment should be made in relation to the cult of the dead, which is associated with Catholic worship. This consists of the practice of prayers and oblations for the departed spirits, and is likewise rejected as contrary to scriptural dogma (III, v, 741-743). In its broader and more essential project, Calvinism aimed at a rejection of the world, this being properly understood not as a withdrawal from the world, but as a rejection of things worldly. This means that although we must appreciate the works of God in nature and enjoy "with propriety and decency" the earthly comforts made available to us through Divine Beneficence, we must be eternally vigilant lest we succumb to the excesses of sensorial gratification, and make the latter an end in itself. It should also be purely utilitarian, a means by which we can be assisted, not retarded, in our passage through the earth. We are thus commanded to use the world "as though we used it not," to "resolutely exert ourselves" so as to banish from our terrestrial existence every "intemperance in eating and drinking, and excessive delicacy, ambition, pride, haughtiness, and fastidiousness (in all sectors of life) . . . every care and affection, which would either seduce or disturb us from thoughts of the heavenly life, and attention to the improvement of our souls" (Book HII, pp. 785-791). The all-encompassing nature of the rejection of the world should be readily evident from the above passage. We can also see the absolute necessity of submerging human reason and will under the will of God. This point is stressed in the doctrine of self-denial, which is foundational to Calvinism. Because the whole of human nature is corrupt and contaminated by sin (Book II, pp. 275-276), we must not seek to glorify it. Instead, we must recognize the evil that emanates from within ourselves, and which directs the totality of our existence towards unholiness. This recognition is never ending, and constitutes the principle of repentance. Essentially, we are dealing with a continuous mode of existing, an unceasing process of spiritual regeneration comprising: (a) the recognition of our perpetually sinful state, and (b) the "mortification of our flesh" (III, iii, 5). Such is the ethical basis supporting the Calvinist project of rejection of the world. A number of important aspects are immediately revealed to us. We can see, for example, that the roots of ascetic guilt are found in this attitude of perpetual vigilance against sin. We can see the absolute reliance on formal law as a guiding principle of life. More importantly, it is clear that the repudiation of the sensuous is not limited to specific elements, but ultimately, to all that is most purely human. The dissociation from sin and iniquity amount fundamentally to a "denial of ourselves," of all our "selfish considerations" (III, vi, 2). Certainly, the repudiation of physical gratification as such is a crucial dimension in this attitude, and the most pertinent one with respect to the attack of Calvinistically-oriented Protestantism on the "material" aspects of primitive religion. Calvin's words to the effect that the "deliverance from the body is an introduction into complete liberty" (111, ix, 4) are crystal-clear in their practical implications. The aspect of fasting is of interest here. For if Calvinism upholds abstention from food as a valid exercise in sanctification, it is in its broader figurative sense, i.e. as a symbolic renunciation of the sensuous, that fasting takes on greater significance. We must live in a perpetual fast, characterized by "frugality and sobriety" toward all that is sensorially pleasurable; ultimately, from all that is most spontaneously human. At this point, the two interrelated levels of this ethical position can be established: (a) the specific level of sensorial gratification, and (b) the more inclusive level of human delibera- tion. The first case is forcefully addressed by Calvin in his exhortation that by divesting ourselves of all corporeal influence we are introduced into complete liberty. The second case</page><page sequence="15">AFRO-AMERICAN RELIGIOUS SYNCRETISM 313 is the notion that in order for us to be entirely free of sin and iniquity, we must strive for all- encompassing self-denial. Both of these levels are crucially important as we examine the stance of Calvinistically-oriented Protestantism towards particular and general features of this- worldly religion(s). The distrust of sensorial and emotional pleasures is directly relevant for the specific question of African worship patterns (i.e. the elements of song and dance). The surrender of human will and reason to formal religious law bears on the experiential, this- worldly foundation of West African religious models. The total rejection of the individual, discussed above, is regulated and made possible by strict adherence to abstract legal principle, namely, to scriptural law. In this formulation of religious experience, trust is logically found in a universal, atemporal system of rules, a "course of instruction for all ages" (I, vi, 2), the complete observance of which must be the basis of Christian life. In the law we have not only a reference point for recognizing our own sinful nature, but also a constant source of control for the latter. The law "restrains the violence of the carnal desires" (II, vii, 10). In this way, sanctification and salvation are achieved through the systematic dependence on scriptural law. Its abandonment, on the other hand, is "detestable sacrilege" (I, ix, 1), and leads to damnation. With such a formalistic and universalistic basis of rejection of the world, Calvinism is directly opposed to "primitive" religion, exemplified here by both West African religion and Luso-Brazilian Catholicism. These religious orientations prioritize existence and particularism over abstract universal principle. Given this structural conformation of Calvinism, it remains for us to address the issue of philosophical universality of this religion, specifically with regard to the existence of guide- lines for the dissemination of Calvinist thought to the non-faithful. The aim here, therefore, is to establish the existence of a sense of mission, a proselytizing spirit, a concern with preaching to, and the conversion of, the heathen. It stands to reason that the power of Calvinism over non-Christian culture should be measured in reference to the efficacy of the proselytizing efforts of its priesthood. Furthermore, this power would be intensified if every member of the Calvinist congregation were entrusted with the office of spreading the Word, thus making up collectively a formidable array of Christian warriors against non-Christian cultures. In this connection, Calvin's position is clear in the idea that the possession of the blessings of true religion is not meant to be confined to those only whom God has entrusted with such blessings; rather, they are to be shared, "dispensed for the benefit of our neighbors" (III, vii, 5). He explicitly invokes God's command: "Go preach the Gospel to every creature," and thus secures for Calvinism divine legitimation for the apostolic office. The entire world of creation, in all its human diversity, is to be "reduced to obedience in Christ" (IV, iii, 4), and Calvinist apostles must not, accordingly, be deterred in their efforts to spread the gospel by whatever obstacle-be that ignorance, indifference, or defiance. The task of opposing untrue faiths and proclaiming the true one must be met with enthusiasm and diligence by everyone; it must not be "confined to public discourses, but extend also to private admonitions" (IV, iii, 6). SOUTHERN RELIGION AND THE SILENCING OF THE DRUMS The preceding analysis of Calvinism had two fundamental goals. First and most impor- tantly, to stress the underlying Calvinist attitude of distrust of the world; secondly, to reveal the more concrete denunciations of the theologian from Basel of what he saw as the heathen, idolatrous constitution of "Papism." With respect to the latter point, it is not unreasonable to suppose that all other forms of religion that were structurally similar to Catholicism would</page><page sequence="16">314 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS have met with equally fiery condemnation. The West African religious systems are a case in point, as we review their basic traits: complex ritual, magico-religious orientation, the cult of the dead, sacrifices and offerings, and mediation by religious intermediaries. This being the case, the evangelists of the slavery period in the United States, deeply influenced by the Calvinist world-view, logically would have antagonized the religious manifestations of the slaves which, like all forms of "popery," were considered to be heathenism of the worst sort. As will be shown, social pressures against the continuation of African culture in the U.S. were in fact realized through the efforts of the missionaries. Our specific interest here is, of course, the suppression of religious culture. But since African peoples as a rule make no formal distinction between the sacred and the secular, we must consider the Protestant reaction toward African culture in general. Some of the aspects of this culture might, at first glance, appear to be purely secular, but are in fact closely interwoven with the religious experience. No better examples can be cited than general musical expression, i.e. dancing, drumming, and singing. Metraux's report on Haitian voodoo (1959) emphasized this intimate relationship of dancing with worship patterns. The dancing theme is also closely related to African religious mythology, religious initiation, and funeral rites (Mbiti, 1970). As suggested above, the stern character of Calvinism, with its avoidance of all undisci- plined behavior and sensorial gratification, coupled with the apostolic zeal, would seem to have led the Calvinist-oriented ministers and preachers of the Old South to oppose vigorously the this-worldly religious practice of the Africans, particularly in its more sensorially-stimu- lating aspects, such as dancing. After all, these clergy were the closest and most important source of ethical and spiritual authority for the black population in the antebellum period. The record shows that this is precisely what happened. Writing in reference to the 19th century, a time when Protestantism made great inroads among U.S. blacks, Phillips informs us that "in the evangelical churches dancing and religion were held to be incompatible. At one time on Thomas Dabney's plantation in Mississippi, for instance, the whole Negro force fell captive in a Baptist revival and forswore the double shuffle. 'I done buss my fiddle an' my banjo, and done fling 'em away,' the most music-loving fellow on the place said to the preacher when asked for his religious experiences" (19918:314). Another writer (Jackson, 1930:110) states that the conversion into the Baptist doctrine normally led them to quickly abandon "their banjos, fiddles, double-shuffle and break-down." In the Sea Islands slaves were taught, again by the Baptists, that dancing and instrumental music were sinful, but they managed to insert these elements into their religious worship through the spirituals and what is known as the "ring shout" (see Johnson, 1930:150- 151).6 The accounts left to us by 19th century travelers in the Southern U.S. tend to confirm these investigations. Sir Charles Lyell noticed on the Hopeton plantation in Georgia that slaves were "passionately fond" of dancing and music, but more than twenty violins had been silenced by the Methodist missionaries (1950:363). Fredrika Bremer, traveling through ante- bellum South Carolina and Georgia, writes about the amusements of the slaves, saying that in these states "the preachers have done away with dancing and the singing of songs" (1968:117, Vol. It). This same observer was told by a planter that: . . . the Methodist missionaries, who are the most influential and effective teachers and preachers among the Negroes are very angry with them for their love of dancing and music, and declare them to be sinful. And whenever the Negroes become Christian, they 6. According to first-hand reports (e.g. Payne, 1969:253-255) and other sources (e.g. Marks, 1974:87- 88), there is reason to believe that the ring form of religious dancing was not confined to the Sea Islands area, but occurred in other parts of the United States as well.</page><page sequence="17">AFRO-AMERICAN RELIGIOUS SYNCRETISM 315 give up dancing, have preaching meetings instead, and empty their musical talents merely in psalms and hymns (1968:290, Vol. 1968:290, vol. I). Olmsted, writing in the 1850s, comments on earlier times, when: . . .the slaves were accustomed to amuse themselves, in the evening and on holidays, a great deal in dancing, and they took great enjoyment in this exercise. It was at length, however, preached against and the 'professors' so generally induced to use their influence against it, as an immoral practice that it has greatly 'gone out of fashion' (1856:128). But even in earlier times the growing evangelical influence on secular entertainment is revealed in reports such as that of Philip V. Fithian, who lived in Virginia as a plantation tutor in the mid-1770s. He tells us that the religious zeal of the (Ana) Baptists led to the "entire Banishment of Gaming, Dancing, and Sabbath-Day diversions" (1943:96). This basic opposition prevailed everywhere in the South, as well as in other Protestant settings in the New World.' This fact is richly documented in several reports for the British West Indies (see, e.g. Goveia, 1965; Green, 1976; Simpson, 1978) showing that the Protestant suppression of slave culture in those islands was equally harsh and systematic. In Protestant areas where Africanisms persisted despite this opposition, other factors were at play. The West Indies are, of course, a case in point, but we must consider for that area the nature of the masters' reaction, first of all to aboriginal slave culture, and secondly, to missionary activity (masters in the Caribbean area were much more oppositional, even violent, toward the work of the missionaries than in the American South). 7. It must be noted, of course, that slave dancing and entertainment remained a typical feature of plantation life throughout the slavery era, the opposition of the evangelical churches notwithstanding. However, the multiple-legal, social, ecclesiastical-impediments to African culture shaped the pattern of slave dancing in the U.S. away from the African matrix, and towards the European end of the acculturation continuum. The prevalent use of the fiddle and banjo (but mainly the former), as opposed to the African drum and other African instruments (see Southern, 1983, especially pp. 43-47; 182-183; also, 53-54, 134-136, 178-179), was but one manifestation of this phenomenon. Whereas in Brazil and in Caribbean settings the African character of black dance and instrumentality was at once apparent to anyone familiar with West African dance forms, in the United States, it is pointed out (Herskovits, 1972:270), "pure African dancing is almost entirely lacking except in certain subtleties of motor behavior." The area of Louisiana may be an exception in this regard, but it must be treated separately because of the particular nature of its colonization. As for the religious dimension proper, the Africans were able to insert their religious dances into the emotionally-charged atmosphere of the camp meeting revival. But even in that special situation, they were not immune to the disapproval of the evangelists. Regarding the all-black, unsupervised plantation religious exercise, it may have retained elements of style (not content) from the African background (on this point, see Rawick, 1974; Blassingame, 1979; Escott, 1979; Raboteau, 1980), but it was also greatly inhibited by a very harsh and effective system of surveillance (on the patrol system of the South, see Henry, 1968). Ecstatic religious expression emerges as the key feature of black folk religions, both during and after slavery. Black worshipping patterns, especially in the countryside, have indeed remained strongly emo- tional, atheological, experiential. Writers like Frazier (1964) believe that this is largely due to the white revivalist influence of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, who had a central role in the mass conversion of the Africans to Christianity, and set a model of religious behavior for them. Others, such as Raboteau (1980:67) argue that the whites themselves might have been influenced by the worship style of the blacks. Herskovits (1972) supports this latter view and adds that blacks in the U.S. managed to retain thefonn of African religious excitement (i.e. rhythmic clapping, ring dancing, styles of singing, moving, etc.) and "reinterpreted" it in the context of evangelical Protestantism. Whatever the case may be, it remains a fact that Protestantism hindered the survival on American soil of well defined, readily recognizable, full- blown retentions of African worship.</page><page sequence="18">316 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS We have examined here the relationship of Catholicism in Brazil and Protestantism in the United States with West African religions, in the framework of Max Weber's typology of religions of salvation. Catholicism, as practiced in colonial and Imperial Brazil, differed from the orthodox version of Rome for having a complex of ritual and belief that brought it much closer to "primitive" religion, as exemplified by the religious systems of the slaves. In reference to the category of this-worldly religion, this brand of Catholicism was a structural analogue to the West African religions. The other-worldly, ascetic Protestantism of the U.S., on the other hand, was antithetical to them. The basic dichotomy in the analysis, therefore, is not between Christian and non-Christian models, but between this-worldly and other-worldly ones. From this perspective, the structure of worship and ritual of the different groups can be contrasted much more effectively. The official posture of the ecclesiastical powers in relation to the native religion of the Afro-Americans was normally one of antagonism, regardless of whether these powers wore Catholic or Protestant stripes. However, this oppositional stance became attenuated, even transformed, by the variable of structural convergence, in the case of Catholicism, and exacerbated by structural divergence, in the case of Protestantism. The latter invariably proved the more belligerent of the dominant religious bodies in contact with non-Christian cultures. Metraux corroborates this fact by reporting that in Haiti the various fundamentalist sects were unrelenting in their attack on voodoo, because this religion was equated with satanism, and, as such, "treated with total intransigence" (1959:351). Herskovits writes in the same vein that in the New World "the aggressive proselytizing activities of Protestantism made the retention of the inner forms of African religion as difficult as its outer manifestations" (1972:233). The greater malleability of Catholicism in Brazil and the marked antipathy of Protestant- ism in the United States towards the religion(s) of the African slaves have been demonstrated in this essay. As indicated, the coexistence of Protestant and West African religious content, particularly as concerns the ritual and liturgical dimensions, proved difficult from the begin- ning; whereas the ritual life of Brazilian Catholicism allowed, in dialectical fashion, for significant levels of syncretism as well as preservation of ethnic identity for the minority group, within the larger process of national consolidation.
