<plain_text><page sequence="1">Contemporary Thinking About Primitive Religion By William J. Goode We are crossing a historic threshold in the scientific study of religion. We move from an era of the unprovable insight, to one of systematic observation. We step from an epoch of individual contemplation, to one of collective onslaught on the problems of religion. The new analysis, as opposed to the old, does not look for universal theological truths in other religions, but rather seeks sociological generalizations. Our sources of fact become more than the doctrines written by religious leaders, and come to include as well the attitudes, decisions, and actions of ordi- nary men. Finally, our perspectives become wider. We are no longer confined to a) our own society, to b) the historical tradition of the western world, or even to c) that of the major civilizations of the world, such as Egypt of the New Kingdom, China of the era of Shi Hwang Ti, Assyria of Asshurbanipal, or the final days of the Mayans before the intrusion of the Europeans. We now draw into our focus d) all socie- ties whose religious systems and religious behavior we can describe accurately and in adequate detail. We are required, then, to grant equal intellectual and scien- tific importance to the religious systems of the Dahomey and the Augustan Romans, the Zuñi and the Tibetans, the Lacandones and the Unitarians: In short, to the primitive as to the "civilized" religions. Now, it is true that certain religions have had greater impact upon our personal lives, because they form part of our group tradition - the Hebrew, for example. This fact does not make them more fundamental than primitive religions in our research into the major structural facts about religious systems. That is, the scientific importance of a reli- gious system is not increased in the slightest by its personal or groupai importance to the researcher. Our generalizations must fit the "primi- tive" religions as well as the "civilized". Before accepting this blunt assertion, let us first look briefly at the bases of this distinction, to see whether there are any differences between primitive religions and the religions of civilizations, which would be obviously necessary and germinal in the development of scien- tific theories about religion. An examination of the distinction is parti- cularly worthwhile, for it is too often accepted without question. This distinction had its origins in a commonsense observation. This observation was no more than a self-evident assumption until the Darwinian notions about biological evolution were extrapolated and generalized beyond biological theory, to the social sciences. The observation was made by</page><page sequence="2">Contemporary Thinking About Primitive Religion 123 every explorer, missionary, traveler, hunter, and ethnologist who brought us data about primitive tribes, from the middle 16th Century until the beginnings of the 20th Century. In commonsense terms, the report was this: The natives are "backward". They do not understand what we understand, or according to our ways. Their tools are poor. Their societies seem crude, poor, undeveloped, simple, homogeneous, and in summary - within our habit-bound thoughtways these societies often appear equivalent to those of primeval man, perhaps of the early Neolithic period. That theoretical edifice, extrapolated from solid biological theory, swiftly collapsed at the turn of the 20th Century, just as all previous attempts to build social science upon the models of other sciences have collapsed. One sub-field of Darwinian thought, that of ecology , did stimulate a minor field of sociology, social ecology, but the latter has had to develop its own techniques and theory. The parent science can stimulate; it rarely furnishes important substantive propo- sitions. The major facts about social structures can not be classified or organized, much less interpreted, by reference to biological evolution. We came back, perhaps sadly, to the hard work of patient observation of our own facts, small-scale hypothesizing, and tiny bits of theory, won with difficulty from awkward data. However, the old distinction did not die. A second foundation was used, and once more the old idea lived on as a habit of thinking. In its second transformation, it leads us to take for granted an unproved relationship that is always implicit in it: a correlation or association between 1) technological advancement on the one hand, and 2) socio- structural patterns on the other. We can of course rank almost all known societies along the continuum of scientific and techno- logical knowledge. The stone cultures of Australia and Tierra del Fuego would fall toward the lower pole, and of course the Western culture complex would be at the other extreme. It is the other variable that is recalcitrant, that of sociostructural patterns. We have no scientifically validated laws which can then predict which institutional and speci- fically religious patterns will be found for any given level of techno- logical development. We have no systematic or reliable body of social theory that represents even the beginnings of unsteady but fruitful steps toward understanding social change. Until we do, this evolu- tionary assumption - i. e., an assumption about patterns, regularities, of social change - is useless and even harmful to our thinking. Until we have made such a step, we shall not even know in what ways the distinction might be theoretically strategic. It is a mere literary cliché to refute this frequent distinction by com- menting that the ancestors of those same Europeans who evolved this observation into systematic social theory would in their own</page><page sequence="3">124 William J. Goode epochs have been regarded as "primitives" by the subjects of Iknaton or Alexander, or perhaps by even those of Asoka. We all know that the main locus of advanced learning and technology has shifted from one great civilization to another. This literary answer is irrelevant. The question is, rather, along what dimensions the distinction between primitive and civilized religions can be scientifically important. Let us look at some of the dimensions or factors that are often used as a basis for this distinction. 1) The field anthropologist knows, even if Paul Radin had not made such eloquent polemics about the matter, that the primitive religious belief ist not homogeneous. There are atheists and believers, reli- gious traditionalists and creators, in any primitive society. 2) We cannot distinguish these beliefs by their simplicity . The complex inter- weaving of belief, legend, myth, and dogma among the Murngin is as far-ranging and intricate as that of most civilized religions. Doubtless, the rituals of the Dahomey are more complex than most. By compari- son, most bodies of Protestant ritual und belief seem barren and unde- veloped. 3) Although there is considerable integration between religion and political power in most primitive societies, as there is in our own, there is also conflict: We cannot assume a perfect harmony merely be- cause we have not bothered to collect all the discrepant facts. 4) We cannot even say that Western society is worldly, while primi- tive cultures are constantly suffused by and oriented toward religion. Many of our own fairly recent historical epochs of the West were deeply concerned with religion, and at least one primitive society has gravely debated whether to change religions (e. g., the Manus) for worldly rea- sons. 5) We are certainly too sophisticated in our generation to think of primitive religions as somehow „magical", while our own are "truly" religious. All major world religions have a considerable magical con- tent, and the folk beliefs in those religions have strongly developed magical patterns (e. g., the Catholic). 6) Moreover, after the monumen- tal work of Pater Schmidt, we can no longer assume that primitive reli- gions have no ethical content, as contrasted with our own. 7) We are also not permitted to think of primitive religions as changing only very slowly , in contrast to civilized religions. Aside from the serious problems of measuring ideational or ritual change (and if we cannot measure it, we cannot presume to claim that one religious pattern changes more rapidly than another), we simply have no data on indi- genous social change among primitives. Primitives claim that little change has occured: "Things have always been so", just as do peasants. But we cannot accept that claim when we have no historical records by which to test that assertion. Moreover, once we move from modern We- stern civilizations, it is clear that many Eastern societies (even urban</page><page sequence="4">Contemporary Thinking About Primitive Religion 125 ones) have gone long periods without much change. Thus, the variable of rapidity of change is not useful as a distinction between primitive and civilized religions. Not even the energetic American exponents of that empty, value-laden concept, "culture lag", with all their rese- arch into technical and social change, have ever succeeded in a) measu- ring ideational or ritual change; b) correlating ritual and technological development; or c) demonstrating how slowly primitive religions change. In sum, when we seriously compare the behavioral facts of primitive religions in all their richness of emotion, variation, complexity, inter- relationships with similar facets and areas of "civilized religions", we understand that a) the similarities are greater than the differences; b) the differences among the many primitive religions are just as wide as differences among civilized religions; and c) even if the distinction should later become strategic, we have no theoretical or empirical grounds for using it now. The fact that one occupation (the anthropologists) concentrates on primitives, and another (the socio- logists) upon civilized nations is no more than an interesting fact in the history of social science, and this fact does not validate the distinction. All these facts require us to assent to a still further conclusion: we must not let this (often unconscious) habit lead us to identify primi- tive religion with primeval religion. We are absolutely barred from ever understanding primeval religion. We shall never have the necessary data. We cannot extrapolate from artifacts, such as pre- sumptively sacred figurines or altars, to the religous meaning of these objects. These meanings, the patterns of social interaction in reli- gious behavior, can be abstracted and deduced (though poorly) from a) writings, or from b) observing and interviewing living human beings. They cannot be discovered by studying the physical objects alone, and for primeval man we have only these last data. Upon almost any com- plex of physical objects an almost infinite variety of religious and social patterns can be imagined and developed. It is the meanings that are primary. Without these, the objects will forever remain mute. The reli- gions of primeval man will remain forever unknown to all social scien- tists, though doubtless many poet-scientists will persuade themselves that they have intuited these meanings. These related propositions do not assert that a) there is no evolutio- nary pattern; or that b) there are no differences between primitive and civilized religions. Rather, we assert that except for technological deve- lopment we have no worthwhile theory of evolution for social struc- tures and particularly for religious structures; and that b) the differen- ces that do appear between civilized and primitive religions have not been shown to be theoretically strategic.</page><page sequence="5">126 William J. Goode If this time-worn distinction be properly viewed with skepticism, then another mental bias must be thrown out: the belief that the scientifically most fundamental description of a primitive society must refer to its pre-European phase. This prejudice is a corollary of the above distinction, and contains all its weaknesses. No primitive society is, or ever was, "pure". All have had many contacts with other socie- ties, and thus may have changed gradually through these contacts. The search for "untouched" primitive societies is a literary, not a scientific, quest. It parallels the old search for "pure" races, and has just as little intellectual significance. If we are looking for social patterns, for social laws, for modes of interaction, for an understanding of social behavior, we must understand these phenomena where we find them. A primitive society undergoing rapid social change because of contact with Western European culture is just as rich a source of social data as the geogra- phically and socially most isolated culture in the world. From the foregoing argument, a further inference is clear: there is no theoretically important distinction between anthropology and sociology (or, indeed, between either of these and social psychology) if we are ana- lyzing religious institutions. Now, in social science we seek pattern, order, laws, generalizations. We know that our sciences are crude. Both our data and our laws do not have the rigor of even, say, 18th Century chemistry. Therefore, we are likely to generalize prematurely. This, however, is no danger so long as we are dedicated to judging the worth of our generalizations by a stubborn analysis of the facts. Our premature generalizations may be destroyed, but if we stick to the facts even our premature theories will be improved cumulatively . Let me, then, attempt these tasks in the remaining paragraphs: 3) Offer some tentative generalizations about religious patterns; 2) Spe- cify one major task that lies immediately before us; and 3) Suggest some of the operational consequences that flow from an acceptance of the position outlined here. Although Durkheim's work was based upon several false premises, it was productive of important hypotheses. In a study published several years ago, I attempted 1) to build upon some of his correct notions, 2) to offer a serious critique of theories of religion, and 3) to take several steps forward in the sociology of primitive religion. In the remaining space, it is possible to do no more than to reproduce some of these gene- ralizations; the careful student can see immediately that they could now be further developed in a more systematic and detailed fashion1. They 1 See William J. Goode, Religion among the Primitives, Free Press, Glencoe, 111., 1951, esp. pp. 52 - 55.</page><page sequence="6">Contemporary Thinking About Primitive Religion 127 are presented here only to suggest the beginnings of generalized hypo- theses. 1. Human societies distinguish between secular and sacred things, as defined by the group attitudes in the society. 2. These sacred things include various objects, among which are to be found natural forces and animals; or inanimate objects, deities, acts, areas, words, gestures, etc.; and it is the religious context which defines whether at a given time an otherwise secular object is trans- formed into the sacred. 3. The socialization process, which sometimes includes specific cult training as well (adult socialization), inculcates knowledge of and respect for the sacred. 4. Conformity with religious prescriptions will usually give support . to other institutions and to common (or groupai) goals, due to the integration of the social structure at the common-value level. 5. The religious practitioners gain certain advantages from their relationship to the sacred, such as prestige, power, and goods. 6. The supernatural entities, or gods, are not always held to have bodies like men, but their values, attitudes, perception, and thoughts are "anthroposocial". That is, their "personalities" are like those of members of the society. This is evidenced by these facts: a) The deities take notice of man's actions; b) The deities act broadly to further man's welfare, such welfare conforming closely to the society's desires; c) The deities desire human attention, and are pleased by honor paid to them, as well as displeased by neglect; d) The deities usually punish men for not acting in accordance with the rules of the society, such punishment usually occurring in this world; e) The deities are not invariably "good", for they may also have "moods", and some are whimsical or destructive at times; f) The relationships between deities and men, and among deities, are also conceived in such social terms, in that there will be com- munication, promises, reminders, approval, and perhaps even threats. 7. There is a body of religious belief common to the society, which may not always be developed into a "doctrine", but which constitutes the meaning of ritual . These beliefs treat the origin and nature of the deities, and their relationships to men. punishment, the nature of human souls and their destiny, etc.; and impute order and sense to the cosmos.</page><page sequence="7">128 William J. Goode 8. Religious rituals make many actional demands upon men, and thus form the link between religion and other spheres of action, so that one can observe the concrete interrelationships of the reli- gious system with other social action: by diverting, increasing, or decreasing production, distribution, and consumption; and shifting or strengthening the political structure. 9. The sacredness of objects and of rituals is based upon their sym- bolic character, as representative of the will or action of the deities, or as objective embodiments of religious belief. 10. Rituals are not thought of as contractual in character, but they will contain frequent requests for favors. 11. Magic and religion are not dichotomies, but make up a conti- nuum along several identifiable dimensions, and are distinguished only ideal-typically. Some of these dimensions are: specificity of goal desired, manipulative vs. cajoling attitude, type of professional-client relationship, collective vs. private ends, etc. The fuller hypothetical development and empirical testing of such beginnings require, however, an acceptable typology of religious systems: our generalizations will be correct only under specified con- ditions and for specific institutional complexes. We cannot go far in any generalizing scheme, until we have identified the variables which at different values create different types. There are in any science only few generalizations that fit nearly all its phenomena; most laws apply to sub-sets of phenomena. We must therefore find out what in our area, religious institutions, are the major elements, types, classes ' - and to do this, we must begin to identify the major characteristics and variables that go to make up such types. This is fundamental, and the answer will not be found in some evo- lutionary scheme, or in moral evaluations, or in rankings of technologi- cal advancement. My own attempt to do no more than suggest some of these was certainly not satisfactory. It was developed merely to show that certain religious systems varied from one another along theoretically important dimensions, and that therefore generalizations applying to all of them would not often occur by accident. Here, we may outline these dimensions without discussing them, only to show in what direction such a conceptual development ought to go. 1. Variation in religious personnel a) Extent of formal training; b) Degree of identification between secular leaders, and the sacred leaders and followers. 2. Variation in type of societal matrix a) Degree of emphasis upon affectivity vs. affective neutrality;</page><page sequence="8">Contemporary Thinking About Primitive Religion 129 b) Self-interest vs. collectivity orientation; c) Universalism vs. particularism; d) Functional specificity vs. diffuseness; e) Ascription vs. achievement. S. Variation in sacred entities: from highly abstract, distant entities not clearly defined; through broad, natural forces; to various de- grees of anthropomorphism in gods and spirits; to animals, plants, and other natural objects. 4. Variation in ritual a) Development of symbolism; b) Degree of elaboration of ritual. 5. Variation in religious belief a) Beliefs about the soul; b) Explanations of rituals; c) Punishment and expiation; d) Origins of gods and men. Even if these tentative suggestions are rejected, a major typology must be created, using those variables which mainly determine religious patterns, and structure the religious institutions. It is through these institutions that the major social structural forces of the society are implemented, or made active. It is only through the institutional pre- scriptions, through the institutional definitions of appropriate role be- havior, that men are made to want to do the things that must be done if the society is to survive. As I now view the problem, here are some of the operational and procedural consequences that seem to flow from the exceedingly con- densed theoretical position outlined above: 1. We are thus forced to turn away from the fascinating but unans- werable question as to the "ultimate reality" of religion. We cannot know scientifically what lies behind religion. What we can know is in this world: the institutional patterns, the social behavior, the human meanings and emotions of religious action. 2. We shall attempt to remain on one major emergent level, the socio- logical, in our analyses, in order to obtain the maximum generalizing power. When we move from this theoretical level to that of psycho- dynamics or the economic, we shall at least be aware that we have shifted levels. We shall not use the variables of one level as specious solutions of problems at another level. 3. Our studies will be cross-cultural, comparative-historical, so as to obtain as wide a range of data as possible. Only thus shall we be able to develop adequate generalizations. This will require international cooperation between scholars who dedicate themselves to the analysis of religion. 3 Sociologus V, 2</page><page sequence="9">130 William J. Goode 4. We shall try to formulate specific hypotheses as deductions from, or inductions to, our general laws. We cannot have a cumulation of knowledge without negating some existing hypotheses. We cannot negate hypotheses unless they are specific enough to he disproved . To assert that "religion is somehow integrated with other institutions", for example, is doubtless correct, but it is impossible to disprove its correct- ness or even its fruitfulness until we deduce detailed hypotheses from it. We are not daring enough in our thinking unless we formulate such specific hypotheses as permit disproof. This means, as a corollary, that we can then begin to specify the conditions of social structure under which given hypotheses are correct. Disproof is not accomplished by merely citing a negative case. The negative case may, rather, give us a clue to understanding under what definite conditions the previous asser- tion is correct. All scientific laws contain, implicitly or explicitly, a statement of the conditions under which they hold. 5. We shall begin more systematically to formulate research designs, in as close a logical and concrete approximation to the controlled expe- riment as is possible. Ample evidence is now available, from the best of social science research, that this can be done. The fact that we as scientists cannot ourselves change the value of the variables in a given case does not lessen the logical rigor of a good research design: the astronomer, the cosmogonist, the meteorologist are even more help- less than we to "experiment" with the physical world2. With good research design, we can at least begin to locate the more important variables and phenomena. . 6. These facts mean that we abandon salon Freudianism, just as we have already abandoned vulgar Marxism, as being a literary pose rather than serious attempts to develop a cumulative body of tested generali- zations. We are no closer to "the real factors" of religion when we seek psychodynamic interpretations, than when we look for economic interests. Both these represent potentially important theoretical contri- butions, but not refuges (akin to the older refuge of instinctualism) from the stubborn analysis on a single major theoretical level. 7. We then recognize, when trying to understand any concrete reli- gious system, that religious behavior, emotion, and meaning, are not a homogeneous pattern, but must always be described as statisti- cal distributions: For any given characteristic, not all people will fall at the modal point, but some will be distributed between this point and the extremes. For shorthand purposes, we can say that the Manus are "ascetic, profit-seeking, secular, ghost-ridden" people, but not all of 2 See further elementary comments on this point in: William J. Goode and Paul K. Hatt, Methods in Social Research, New York, McGraw-Hill, 1952, Chapters 5 - 8.</page><page sequence="10">Contemporary Thinking About Primitive Religion 131 them are - and this fact is of great importance in interpreting social patterns. We must, therefore, attempt to analyze these deviants ; and not in merely personality terms, since one may be socially deviant and psychologically quite normal. All major social structures pro- duce deviants through pressures on particular social positions. It is the experience of empirical research that the analysis of deviants yields important clues to understanding major social patterns. 8. We shall expect to find various areas of conflict between 1) reli- gious institutions and 2) other institutions. After all, they lay claim to time, energy, goods, and people, and all these are limited. In concrete cases, open conflict will not be actual, but it is always potential. We can specify it abstractly, when we make structural analyses. We are also required to seek it in the social roles that individuals play: The same man is husband, father, brother; acolyte, hierophant, religious apprentice, priest; subject, citizen, or subordinate chief* These conflicts are neither accidental nor mysterious. We must know more of them. 9. We must therefore ascertain the mechanisms by which actual or potential conflicts are mitigated, avoided - or perhaps intensified. Again, we search on both the grand level of sociostructural analysis, and on the more concrete level of social roles. As we gain more know- ledge of such mechanisms within our own societies, we shall know much better which questions we must ask about any society, or any religious system. Conclusion . In the brief compass of this paper, I have attempted to accomplish the following four tasks: 1) State the relationship between the social analysis of primitive religion, and that of civilized religion; 2) Suggest the beginnings of some generalizations about primitive reli- gions; 3) Point to the need for an adequate typology of religion, so that we may begin to collect comparative data about all known reli- gions; here I have merely noted a few of the variables that might be useful in such a typology; and 4) Outline some of the operational conse- quences for our research into religion, which appear to be necessary if we accept the prior argument. The tone of certainty and arrogance in these pages is due to brevity alone. The tasks ahead are difficult, and we shall win our new know- ledge no more easily than our predecessors won theirs. Nevertheless, the goals are worthy of our best talents, and the vistas ahead are exciting. Synopsis Die heutige Auffassung von primitiver Religion In der Erforschung der Religion vollzieht sich z. Z. eine entscheidende Wendung: an die Stelle der spekulativen, nicht beweisbaren Schau tritt die 3*</page><page sequence="11">132 Rüdiger Schott systematische, nach allgemeingültigen soziologischen Aussagen strebende Be- obachtung. Diese richtet sich nicht mehr allein auf die religiösen Führelper- sönlichkeiten und ihre Lehren, sondern ebenso auf das religiöse Handeln und Erleben des Durchschnittsmenschen. Sie mißt den „primitiven" Religio- nen die gleiche wissenschaftliche Bedeutung bei wie den Hochreligionen. Da- mit verliert die herkömmliche (wiewohl ohnehin nur für die technische Ent- wicklung zutreffende) Unterscheidung von „primitiv" und „zivilisiert" ihre Berechtigung. Auch die häufig vorgenommene Gleichsetzung von „primitiv" und „urtümlich" ist unzulässig: da prähistorische Kultgegenstände u. ä. nicht erkennen lassen, welche Bedeutung sie für die Menschen besaßen, bleibt die „urtümliche", d. h. der schriftlosen Vergangenheit angehörende Religion für die soziologische Forschung auf immer verschlossen. Auch die heutigen „pri- mitiven" Religionen sind niemals „rein", d. h. ohne Beeinflussung von an- deren Kulturien zu betrachten; so vermindert sich ihre wissenschaftliche Er- giebigkeit auch durch den Kontakt mit der europäischen Kultur nicht. Die künftige Forschimg bedarf eines Gerüstes von - vorerst nur hypothetischen - Generalisierungen über religiöse Formen; sie verlangt nach einer - wenn- gleich vorläufig nur theoretisch aufzustellenden - Typologie der religiösen Systeme; und sie nötigt zu einer Reihe methodologischer Konsequenzen, so etwa zum Verzicht auf eschatologische Erkenntnisse und zur Beschränkung auf die empirisch zugänglichen religiösen Phänomene.</page></plain_text>
