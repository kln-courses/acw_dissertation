<plain_text><page sequence="1">SENTIMENTAL FABULATIONS, CONTEMPORARY CHINESE FILMS: ATTACHMENT IN THE AGE OF GLOBAL VISIBILITY Rey Chow. New York: Columbia University Press, 2007,304 pp. After the influential Primitive Passions: Visual ity, Sexuality, Ethnography and Contemporary Chinese Cinema established Rey Chow as one of the most original scholars in cinema studies, her second book on Chinese films, Sentimental Fabulations, provides us with a collection of no less ingenious readings of popular and icono clastic works by such diverse Chinese directors as Zhang Yimou, Wong Kar-wai, Tsai Mingliang, and Ang Lee. Bringing them together under a discursive umbrella by the name of "the senti mental," Chow examines their culturally spe cific fantasy structures as well as their engage ments with the complexities of globalization. Although often equated in common usage with affective excess, the sentimental, trans lated into Chinese as wenqing zhuyi or "warm sentiment-ism," is redefined by Chow as a mood of endurance and accommodation, "a disposition of making compromises [with] that which is oppressive and unbearable" (18). The Chinese films that dramatize such heart-wrenching situations as poverty, familial conflicts, exile, illness, death, and loneliness, however, tend to affirm and perpetuate "an indomitable collective will" embodied by the patriarchal family, clan, village, or nation. Thus, Chow finds filiality, the "age-old moral appara tus" of subjectivization, to be "at the heart of Chinese sentimentalism" (22). In her own dense and sophisticated intro duction, Chow not only offers a novel explica tion of the title, but also sheds light on the various ways her book fits into and contributes to the larger discipline of cinema studies that is increasingly entangled with the study of group cultures. The succinct summary of Western film theory, from the hopeful futurism of Walter Ben jamin to the feminist critique of Laura Mulvey, eventually focalizes on the paradigm shift from the ontology of the filmic image (Bazin) and cinematic modes of signification (Metz) to the study of narrativity and ideology. Following Mul vey's "repressive hypothesis"?the notion that the cinematic image has repressed something existing beyond it?critics since the 1980s have "complicated the differential between gaze and image" in terms of group cultural identities (9). The resulting "fetishization of identity," however, can still be broken down into two camps: those who equate artificial images with the lives and histories of "real" cultural groups and those, like Chow, who do not insist on such "anthropomorphic realism." In the case of East Asian cinema, Chow proposes to see Asian ness itself as a "commodified and reproducible value," sustained by and contributing to the flows of capital, rather than to go on an "icono phobic" search for some authentic, continuous Asianness beyond the cinematic images. "Part of my goal in this study is to argue that Chinese cinema since the 1980s is an inherent part of a contemporary global problematic of becoming visible" (13), defined as "a matter of participat ing in a discursive politics of (re) co figuring the relation between center and margins" (11). In a sense, Chow's study attempts to put the study of Chinese films (back) in dialogue in?or rather, in the middle of?Western cinema studies, in order to stall the trend of its ghet toization in the history of Chinese culture. Scat tered here and there in the book are critiques of what she calls "geographical and chronological compartmentalization exercises" that aim at no greater goals than "information retrieval and canonization" (15,150). Hence in her read ings of two Hong Kong films made around 1997 (Wong Kar-wai's Happy Together and Peter Chan's Comrades, Almost a Love Story), Chow deliberately steers free of linking the films to Hong Kong's return to the PRC.

The nine chapters-each a close analysis of one or two individual films that can be read independently from the rest?are grouped by theme into three parts: remem brance of things past, experiences of migrancy (especially by women), and films about disen franchised populations. I shall discuss selected chapters that I have found particularly insight ful or provocative. By way of continuing her tenacious defense of Fifth Generation directors against criticisms of orientalism and inauthenticity, the first chapter presents Chen Kaige's Temptress Moon (1996) as an allegory about (the impossibility of) homes and origins. Just as the classic oppo sition between home and seduction has broken down in the film's narrative, Chow argues, the movie screen is the site of the director's own homecoming and seduction all at once. As Chen self-consciously borrows from films such as Bertolucci's The Last Emperor (1987), "the homecoming that is filmmaking (about one's own culture] inevitably becomes a process of citation and re-viewing and ... of being (re) seduced with the sights/sites of others" (43). Although one might wonder if such cunning ever crossed the director's mind, one must ap plaud Chow's brilliant extraction of allegory and profundity from the most incredible plots and seemingly clich?d images. Finding the "long-standing bias in modern Chinese literary studies for realism" (147) overly oppressive, Chow never treats any film at its face value, but rather reads them as fables?not so much of the Chinese nation or any specific his torical situation, but rather of "global visibility." Borrowing Gilles Deleuze's concept of visibilities, which are "not defined by sight but are com plexes of actions and passions," Chow defines "global visibility" as "the ongoing, late capitalist phenomenon of mediatized spectacularization in which the endeavor to seek social recogni tion amounts to an incessant production and consumption of oneself and one's group as im ages on display" (9,23). Subject to her search ing analysis, films become three-dimensional autostereograms that yield hidden patterns and unexpected logics beyond?or beneath? their alluring surfaces. Therefore, even Zhang Yimou's Not One Less (1999), widely acclaimed by mainland critics for its "return to realism," is seen as a critique of the "usurpatory nature of the mediatized image and its tendency to can nibalize human labor" (164). As Chow incisively points out, despite the protagonist's strenuous physical efforts, "it is when [she] transforms herself into an image on metropolitan television that she finally and effortlessly accomplishes her mission" (161). To take another example of an innovative, if somewhat counterintuitive reading, Chow discovers two orders of images meshed together in Happy Together? documen tary-style images and their magical, dreamlike counterpart?whose coordination she likens to "the relationship between a promiscuous lover and his faithful partner" (61). Many chapters in the book open with co gent outlines of major threads of Western theory?including Lacan, Derrida, Marx, Freud, Foucault, and Heidegger?to be applied to the films under discussion, which, by not quite "fitting" the Western theories or by reconcil ing dialectical opposites, modify, diversify, or update them, in several cases, however, the theoretical preface seems a bit superflu ous to the main thrust of the argument. For instance, it is not altogether fleshed out how Heidegger's ruminations on homelessness and humanism?as well as his silence on the Holocaust?can shed light on Li Yang's Blind Shaft (2003), a dark tale of crime in illegal Chinese mines. Similarly, a history of sexuality according to Freud and Foucault bears only a tenuous connection to her otherwise excellent analysis of Wayne Wang's Eat a Bowl of Tea (1989) and Ang Lee's The Wedding Banquet (1993) with respect to their biopolitics. The main thrust of her argument stands well on its own: female adultery and homosexuality are both patched over at the end by patriarchal ideology "with its resilient power to neutralize and normalize everything" (135). In the case of The Wedding Banquet, the time-honored ob session of Chinese patriarchy with procreation also "feeds elegantly into the trends of con temporary transnational capitalism" (141) by 60 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 61.3 / FALL 2OO9 ?2 9 BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS</page><page sequence="3">purchasing the reproductive labor of a female illegal immigrant. What I found to be the most illuminating and enjoyable parts of Sentimental Fabulations are moments when Chow herself seems sentimen tally?rather than polemically?appreciative of a particular director's work. Such is the case with Tsai Mingliang, whose film The River (1997) is read less for any hidden rhetorical agenda than for its themes and aesthetics in relation to its auteur's larger body of work. As Chow perceptively observes, Tsai's scenes "resemble those of a sparsely decorated stage set on which it is human bodies... rather than human minds that become the primary sites of drama ... The household in Tsai's work is therefore a key archeological find, its members being the walking exhibits of a collective order that has survived in the form of ruins" (184,188). Whether read as a unified study of an endur ing mode of signification in Chinese cinema or as selected fragments to gain insight into spe cific films and directors, Sentimental Fabula tions is a thought-inspiring work of scholarship that does justice to the stimulating films that, in Chow's words, have "revitalized cinematic discourse in the West" (14).
