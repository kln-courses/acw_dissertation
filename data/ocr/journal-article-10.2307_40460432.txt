<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bedouin Religious Practices in Sinai and the Negev Abstract. - The bedouins* extreme exposure to the desert's harsh environment, and their scant recourse to help in the event of adversity, have made their quest for the means to attenuate their fears particularly strong. This quest has led them to adhere to practices that give them the sense of exercising a degree of control over the recurrent afflictions of nature. Among these practices we find the recourse to fatalism, attempts to propitiate Allah, the concept of agents of evil, the creation of taboos, and the belief in the power of magic. Although these various devices do not form a single integral religion, yet, in their appeal to the supernatural, they constitute the bedouin's true religion. It is the purpose of this paper to present some of these practices, as witnessed and understood by the author, and to indicate their relatedness to the natural environment of bedouins past and present. It is also proposed that, while Islam provides a caption for the overall religious identity of the bedouins, it is but one of several belief systems practiced by them simultaneously. Moreover, the survival of the bedouins' pre-Islamic, environment-oriented, practices during the fourteen centuries since the advent of Islam indicates that they have served the bedouins well [Middle East, Bedouins, Religion, Islam, Magic, Ecology] Few cultures reflect so complete an adaptation to a natural environ- ment as that of the bedouins. The scarcity of water in the desert has defined, in both scope and detail, the way of life of a people determined to dwell there. The requisites for survival in the arid desert have left their imprint not only on the bedouins' economic pursuits and standard of living, but also on less tangible domains such as social organization, social values, legal proce- Clinton Bailey (10 Ussishkin Street, Jerusalem) studied Islamic culture and Middle East history at Hebrew University, Jerusalem (B.A. 1962), and at Columbia University, New York (Ph.

So encompassing is this direct link between en- vironmental stimulus and cultural reaction, that one is initially surprised to find a particularly vital area of bedouin life- religion- which seems to be an artificial imposition on the bedouin experience. Islam, the official religion of the bedouins, is a system of beliefs formulated by a non-bedouin, the pro- phet Muhammad, in order to provide spiritual solutions to the environmental problems of sedentary people, rather than nomads. By observing the religious practices of the bedouins in Sinai and the Negev, however, the nature of the bedouin connection to Islam becomes clearer. Islam, while providing a caption for the overall religious identity of the bedouins, is in fact but one of several belief systems practiced by them simultaneously. It is the purpose of this paper to present some of these paral- lel systems, as witnessed and understood by the author during thirteen years of ethnographic fieldwork (1967-1980), and to indicate their relatedness to the natural environment of bedouins past and present.1 1 . The Bedouin as a Muslim The conditions of bedouin life, even in such peripheral areas of the "bedouin world" as Sinai and the Negev, have made it difficult for a bedouin to lead an orthodox Muslim life in the formal sense.2 The constant need to seek pasture in the remote reaches of the desert has always rendered the official Islamic religious institutions inaccessible to him. Only few of the se- veral hundred bedouins the author has known, for example, ever entered a mosque. Few, as well, ever availed themselves of religious personnel such as a For comparative ethnographic material on the religious practices of other Be- douin and non-Bedouin Muslims, the reader is particularly referred to Baldensperger 1893; Canaan 1927; Blackman 1927; Jaussen 1908; Musil 1928; Westermarck 1926; Westermarck and Zwemer 1920. During the period under study the bedouin population of Sinai and the Negev numbered 100,000. Most of this population, although Muslims, had not had sufficient contact with settled Muslim communities in Egypt or Israel to change their traditional re- ligious practices significantly. The exceptions were bedouins living in the northern Negev, the coastal strip of northern Sinai, and the area of south-west Sinai. Many of these be- douins, having become semi-sedentary agriculturists or wage-laborers, were exposed there- by to Muslim religious institutions, and began practicing Islam in a more orthodox man- ner. The material presented in this paper, however, was gathered primarily among tribes still pursuing the traditional bedouin way of life as camel and goat raisers. Their religious condition, therefore, remained largely unchanged from that of bedouins throughout the century. Much of the information was collected among the 'Azãzmah confederation in the central Negev and the Tarâbîn and Tiyãhã confederations in central and southern Sinai, with whom the author maintained close contact. Nevertheless, many of the practices observed in any one group proved, through investigation, to be common to all the tribes that were studied. For the composition of the tribes of Sinai and the Negev see al-'Arif 1934; Bailey and Peled 1975; Murray 1935; Musil 1908.</page><page sequence="3">Bedouin Religious Practices 67 sharVah3 judge to settle disputes, a ma'dün to perform a wedding, or offi- cials to record births, marriages, divorces, or deaths. The distance of be- douin camps from centers of population has also precluded the acquisition of religious instruction for the youth at schools or mosques; and the fact that bedouins generally camp in small, isolated groups has eliminated the possibility of obtaining even a rudimentary religious education from itiner- ant teachers. The normal religious instruction of a bedouin child has there- fore comprised random items of pertinent information that he overhears from his elders, and a deliberate visit or two that he pays to a market settle- ment where someone imparts to him the essentials of prayer. Such visits are made when a boy is in his late teens and able to keep himself "clean, regard- ing ritual impurity" (naztfmin an-nijis); i.e., when he "knows how to cleanse himself of urine and seminal excretion" {ya'rif yinazzif min al-bowl wil- mayyah).4 As a result of so scant an education, Muslim religious practice among the bedouins suffers from much omission, confusion, and commission. One may encounter confusion, for example, in matters as basic as the appointed times of the five daily prayers (al-fara'idh) officially required by Islam. Thus, a bedouin might include the voluntary mid-morning prayer {salãt adh-dhuha) among the farâïdh, confusing it with the mandatory mid-afternoon prayer (salât al-'asr) which he omits, failing to distinguish between the latter and the early-evening prayer (salât al-maghrib)} At funerals, too, one may witness men arguing over the proper form of prayer for the dead- and, not uncom- monly, choosing the wrong form. For example, instead of standing and reci- ting four takbïrat (glorifications of Allah) they may perform four rak'at (prostrations).6 3 Pronunciation: t is pronounced as "th" in "think" ~z, dh, and d are pronounced as "th" in "this" g is pronounced as in "give" 4 ('ayn) and 9('alif) are pronounced as in "car," grief, ' and blue diphthongs: ow is pronounced as in "cow" ay is pronounced as in "day" tanwtn is shown as an, un, in gh is pronounced as a French "r" (Paris). 4 Communication from Swaylim Sulaymãn 'Id Abu Bilayã of the 'Azãzmah Sarã- hîn tribe (central Negev). 5 Such confusion regarding the correct times tor prayer was observea m tne re- mote central Negev and central Sinai among tribes of the 'Azãzmah, Uhaywãt, Badãrah, Huwaytât, and TarãbTn. Examples of garbled versions of standard Muslim prayers among the bedouins were also recorded by the chief officer of the Beersheba District (1929- 1939), 'Ãrif al-'Arif 1933:251-253; see also Jaussen 1908:291. 6 The author witnessed such a performance of the prayers at the bunal ot bhaykh Sulaymãn Salîm Muhaysin Ibn Sari' of the Tarãbín as-Sarãy'ah at Nuwayba' at-Tarâbïn on the west coast of the Gulf of 'Aqabah, on August 30, 1973. For the standard Muslim prayers for the dead, see Shorter Encyclopaedia of Islam 1953: " Salât IV."</page><page sequence="4">68 Clinton Bailey Anthropos 77.1982 Another example of confusion is in the concept of malãykah which the bedouins have changed from its Islamic context. In Islam, the mala'ikah (sing, malak) are angels who accompany a person during his lifetime and record his good and bad deeds in anticipation of Judgement Day (yowm ad- dln)P The bedouins, albeit, adopted the spiritual character of the malãykah, but changed their function. Considering that the word malak derived from the root m-l-k, which means possessing or ruling, rather than m-l-a-k (angel, as in Hebrew), they conceived of the malãykah as "rulers or owners of the ground" (mulük al-ardh). The bedouins hold that, kull shibr min al-ardh mamlük, "every span of the ground is possessed," or kull shibr min al-ardh mar'T, "every span of the ground is under custody." Although the malãykah are not necessarily evil (shayn) they, like the bedouins themselves, are jealous of the territory that belongs to them. There- fore, if a bedouin encroaches upon the territory of some malãykah by lying down or pitching a tent without their leave, they may retaliate by striking him while he sleeps. An attack of the malãykah, called amr ardhlyah (a de- cree from the ground), may result in infirmities such as wij* al-jism (rheuma- tism; lit., body pains) or junün (madness; lit., the action oí jinn). A prudent bedouin, therefore, seeks to mollify the malãykah by requesting their protec- tion, as he would of a fellow bedouin in a strange land. He does this in an appendage to his bedtime prayer: A 'üdu billah min ash-shaytãn ar-rajïm A 'üdu billah min ar-rãy al- 'adîm A 'üdu billah min al-fagr al-magtm Bismillah ar-rafjLmãn ar-rafyîm Y ãhum mulük al-ardh, innã fal-'ardh Wismillah ar-rahmân ar-rahïm May God protect me from accursed Satan May God protect me from destructive slander May God protect me from endless poverty In the name of Allah the merciful and compassionate O rulers of the ground, we seek refuge in your honor, and the name of Allah the merciful and compassionate. Another bedouin bedtime prayer, reflecting the confusion that results from a fragmentary knowledge of religious matters is directed to an 'Alt ar- Rifaï For the concept of malãykah in Islam, see Shorter Encyclopaedia of Islam 1953: "Mala'ikah." Bedouins in other Middle Eastern deserts call the ground spirits jinn or 'a/a- nt (cf. Doughty 1888/1: 177, 300f.; Jaussen 1908: 318ff.; Musil 1928: 411-417; Wester- marck 1926/1: 262-413 for an extensive treatment of the belief in jinn in Morocco). Most of the above information on malãykah was initially communicated to the author by Swaylim Abü Bilãyã of the 'Azãzmah Sarãhín.</page><page sequence="5">Bedouin Religious Practices 59 Anã dãkhil 'al Allah I seek protection with Allah wa'al 'AH ar-Rifa't and with 'Alî ar-Rifâ'ï 'an al-'agrab um ad-dinãbah from the tailed scorpion wash-shibât_ abù shinãbah and the mustachioed millipede8 wal-lifï um ajnãbah and the side-winding viper9 wal-hãm az-zurãgah and the slithering black cobra 1 ° wal-'ankabüt um al-gubür and the spider that fills graves. * * The 'AH ar-Rifâ'ï referred to in the prayer, is, in fact, Ahmad ar-Rifâ'ï who founded a dervish order, the Rifa'ïyah, in the twelfth century. As the Rifa'i- yah in Egypt are famous as snake charmers (hawãyah; sing, hawï) (see Lane 1860: 390 ff.) the reputation of ar-Rifâï, himself, filtered through to the be- douins of Sinai and the Negev as a great "healer of snake-bite and scorpion sting" (hawï, in bedouin terminology).1 2 Ignorant of the Rifâ'ïyah order, however, the bedouins imagine the great healer as having been a holy man, "a friend of the Prophet himself, and one favoured by Allah." The bedouin misnomer of 'AB may be a remnant of the nickname Abu 'Ali, as 'All was the name of Ahmad ar-RifãTs father. (For the life of Ahmad ar-RifãT, see Shorter Encyclopaedia of Islam 1953: "al-Rifa'L") Other confusions often stem from the need to compensate for their ignorance of the religion. For example, the Islamic prayer, al-Fãtikah (the first chapter of the Qur'an) is notably over-utilized by the bedouins. In addition to its prescribed use they will "raise" it (yigïmu al-Fãtihah)-i.e.y recite the prayer holding forth the hands, palms up, as if literally raising it- on any occasion of a religious nature such as finishing a sacrificial meal or even viewing the new moon.13 The simple seven-lined prayer, which the Lat. Scolopendra Cingulata, whose bite is painful but not lethal. The bedouin term Ufi is applied to the Echis Colorata, the Cerastes Cornutus and the Aspis Vipera varieties of snake. The term derives from the image of "alternate co- lors" (l-f-') reflecting the spotted backs of these varieties. Lat. Walterinessia Aegyptia. The same term (hãm) is used by bedouins as far afield as Kuwait (see Dickson 1949: 470ff.). The bedouins have a legend (related together with the prayer by Humayd Sal- man as-Saddãn of the 'Azãzmah Sarahîn) that the 'ankabüt (lat. Paragaleodes Judaicus, whose bite is painful but not lethal) upon receiving the gift of speech swore that "whom- ever I bite will reach the grave" (maldughï ghayr yitubb al-gabr). To avert the effect of this oath when a bedouin is bitten, his family take a neighbour's goat, slaughter it, and put its entrails into water with which they wash the bite. Finally, they dig a grave, place the victim of the bite into it for two or three minutes, and thereby break the spell. For a similar practice in Morocco see Westermarck 1926/11: 356. Hawï literally means "one who can deal with a hayyah (viper)." While yigïmu generally means to perform (a prayer), the bedouins take it more literally to mean "raise." The act of "raising" the fãtihah with upturned hands is associa- ted with two allusions in the mind of the bedouins. The first is of actually conveying the prayer upwards, toward heaven, where the object of the prayer presumably abides. For example, the fãtih,ah, "raised" after a sacrificial meal offered to one's ancestors is thought to "reach the dead and, if they be sleeping, may wake them up" (al-fãtihah towsil al- mayyitin widã hum, al-mayyitin,nayimïn mumkin al-fãtihah tiwâ'ï hum), [Communication</page><page sequence="6">70 Clinton Bailey Anthropos 77.1982 Qur'an (Sürah 15: 87) indeed recommends be "constantly repeated," is ap- parently over-utilized by the bedouins to compensate for their general igno- rance of other official Islamic prayers. In this sense its use may be seen as a commission- an addition to, or improvisation on, Islamic ritual. Such commissions are rife among the bedouins. At burials, for example, while filling in the grave, they say: Yã rahím. Yã rahïm O Merciful. O Merciful Tirham al-gabr al-magïm Have mercy on the eternal grave. 14 Or, when slaughtering an animal, they may say: Anã adakkïkï I slaughter you Wa Allah yizakkïkï God makes you pure Hillaytt lid-dab h You are proper for slaughter Wa frallalki nabikï % Your prophet deemed you proper Allahu akbar Allah is great. 1 s All of his obvious defects as an orthodox Muslim notwithstanding, the bedouin considers himself an excellent member of the faith. In support of this conviction he could point to his observance of the major Muslim holi- days 'Id al-Fitr and id al-Adhha; his practice of male circumcision; his zealous concern for the modesty and propriety of women; his compliance with the Muslim injunction on having more than four wives simultaneously; or his fulfillment of commandments regarding burial, such as the washing of the corpse and laying it in the grave on its right side facing Mecca. Most be- douins the author has met could also claim to observe the month-long fast of Ramadhãn- in some years, at least. Finally, the fervor of the bedouin's daily prayers, although rarely performed five times as prescribed, also attests to his acknowledgement of Allah, the God of the Muslims, as the singular ulti- mate source of good and evil. 16 from Swaylim Abu Bilãyã of the 'Azazmah Sarãhm.] The second allusion is of honoring an object by raising one's hands to one's mouth, kissing them, and extending them to- ward the honoured object, as the bedouin does upon concluding the fãtihah. This ritual show of deference upon viewing the new moon was witnessed among the Jabãlíyah tribe in southern Sinai (cf. Musil 1928: Iff. regarding the joy of the Syrian Ruwalã tribe at seeing the new moon). The author first witnessed this rite at a burial among the 'Azazmah Mas'udïyïn at Bïr al-Mashãsh in the Negev, March 10, 1973. The author heard this formula uttered by members of the 'Azãzmah Sarãhm and Tiyãhã al-'Awãmrah (central Sinai) tribes. Owing to their migrations bedouins commonly pray alone. Those who have be- come semi-settled, however, may construct a temporary mosque in the style used in Arabia at the dawn of Islam: a row of stones laid out to form the border of a room with an entrance from the north and niche (mihrãb) indicating the direction to Mecca ( al- qiblah) to the south. Such a mosque (called musallî, "place of prayer") may be seen at the oases of Dahab and Nuwayba' al-Muzaynah on the coast of the Gulf of 'Aqabah, where bedouins of the Muzaynah tribe congregate in August to harvest their dates.</page><page sequence="7">Bedouin Religious Practices 71 2. Bedouin Non-Islamic Practices Bedouins are not the only human beings- Muslim or otherwise- who resort to unorthodox beliefs and practices as psycho-spiritual aids in coping with the hardships and unpredictability of life. Yet, their extreme exposure to the desert's harsh environment and their scant recourse to help in the event of adversity, have made their quest for the means with which to atten- uate their fears particularly strong. In frequent years of drought they watch the ewes and the camels become barren, their lambs and calves die for lack of milk, and finally the entire livestock wane for lack of pasture. Flash- floods in the desert wãdt often take their toll of flocks and herds, as well as people and property. Chill desert nights and cold winter days reap their toll in high infant mortality and pulmonary diseases that find no cure. Finally, encounters with wolves, snakes, and scorpions often prove fatal, not only to the bedouins' livestock, but to themselves as well. The primitive medicine practised by the bedouins, while not entirely ineffective, is insufficient to deal with the many infirmities to which they are subject. Occasionally they are aided by a fyawï, who is skilled at sucking the poison out of scorpion stings and mild snake-bites. Cauterization (kayy)y a rudimentary form or accupuncture, is often used in attempting to cure rheumatic and arthritic pains, and even, eye cataracts.17 The bedouins also utilize desert plants with medicinal and narcotic properties to treat light maladies such as headache, head cold, toothache, bee-sting, purulent sores, and intestinal cramps.18 If, however, such primitive remedies do not work, there exist few, if any other recourses to aid. Even when modern medicine is theoretically available, poor communications place it beyond the bedouins' reach. Similar- ly, when drought occurs over a wide area, most bedouins must sit by and suffer, their ability to migrate being very limited. The resultant decimation of a bedouin's livestock will leave him nothing to sell and consequently nothing with which to buy sufficient food for his family, sufficient clothing to keep them warm, and even enough goat-hair with which to weave a water- proof and warm tent. The bedouin thus lives in constant fear of the recur- rent afflictions of nature, afflictions over which he has no control. It is not surprising, therefore, that in order to retain peace of mind, he adheres to beliefs and practices that give him the feeling of exercising at least a degree of such control. Although these various devices do not form a single 17 Communication from Sãlim 'Owdah Sälim at-Timtãwí of the 'Azãzmah 'Asïyât, who showed the author cauterization marks on his left temple made when he was a child to check an incipient cataract (shahbih; lit., "greyness"-a reference to the grey film that covers the eye). According to the bedouins shahbih begins with the appearance in one eye of a small grey dot with a black tail, called um day Uh, "the tailed one." Cauterization for cataract is also applied to the underside of the upper eyelid. 18 Bailey and Danin, in their study of 300 desert plants (1981), found 50 plants that were utilized for medicinal purposes.</page><page sequence="8">72 Clinton Bailey Anthropos 77.1982 integral religion, yet in their appeal to the supernatural they collectively constitute the bedouin's true religion. In attempting to understand the be- douin as a Muslim, therefore, we must not view this "natural" religion as an adjunct to Islam, but rather Islam as merely one facet of the natural religion which bedouins in the seventh century A.D. appended to other facets in order to strengthen their sense of security. a) Fatalism One method for contending with "outrageous fortune" is fatalism, the belief that events are predestined, that there is nothing one can do to avert them, and that adversity must be accepted as a matter of course. Bedouin fa- talism is reflected most clearly in the attitude towards death. Condolences, for example, usually seek to diminish the importance of death with phrases such as: wa'd Allah hagg, "meeting with God is a certitude," yãmã bimüt yãmã bïruh, "people always die- people always pass away," or kullu birüh, "everyone passes away." A reflection of this attitude to death may also be discerned in a poem composed in Sinai by a bedouin father when his tiny daughter was bitten by a snake, and died.19 Despite the sadness, so apparent in the poem, its conclusion is fatalistic, with even a touch of ironic humor. Talabtak, ya rabb, yã wisV al-matãlib Tirfa ' 'annã jimV al-balãwi Jatnã al-manãyã tua shãlat ghawãlinã Wa dawwagatnã al-murr 'ugb al-halãwí Shayy 'at bintï biliddit al-khãtir Wa jatriï bintï bi-nãrin itkãwi Unzur ijmaylt shãbik an-nãb Linnï hadîk al-ltyah sirt hãwt Jownt itnïn arjãl sanãdíd Wal-kull minhum Hndhã bid-dama' dãwt Lã budd inmüt winzür al-manãyã Wa yãkil minnã ad-düd kull ash-shahãwt Though I asked you, O God, who can grant each request To lift all harm from upon us, The fates came along and our dear dispossessed And after the sweet gave us bitter to taste. I had sent off my girl with hardly a thought But behold here she comes burning with fright. Then as camels' teeth here are clenched so tight, Thus were mine as I tried to suck at her bite. Then two brave ones passed by and stopped to alight, But even such heroes wept at the sight. No matter, for the fates visit all one night And the worm will eat each of us with great delight. The composer of the poem, 'Id Imfarrij Musa'id of the Tarabïn Hasãblih tribe in south-eastern Sinai recited it to the author on March 13, 1971 at Mayyit Sawwãnah on the 'Ijmah plateau.</page><page sequence="9">Bedouin Religious Practices 73 Fate as death (usually envisaged in the plural: manãyã) is conceived of as women who snare the doomed with rope. Lines from another poem from Sinai20 depict this image clearly: Low $irt tayr tul 'umrak tihúm Ahkãm rabbak ghayr tinfid bi-mïad Wa low §irt mãbayn as-smã win-nijüm Habí al-manãyã wayn mã tigurtah sãd Be you even a bird flying ever about God's will in the end must be carried out. Even if you hover between sky and star, The rope of fate will snare you wherever you are. In matters of lesser moment than death, fate is commonly referred to as naslb (lit., that which is "set up" for one). A popular proverb, using the imagery of hospitality, says: Vzim wikrim-wa akl al-'aysh nasïb, "Invite a guest and honor him- but whether or not he'll eat your bread, fate will decide." b) Attempts to Propitiate Allah While fatalism may be helpful to a bedouin in contending with misfor- tune, the passive anticipation of events is evidently not sufficient to provide him with peace of mind. Human nature impels the bedouin to employ more active means to control his fate. Chief among these means is to curry favor with the ultimate source of good and evil, who, since the beginning of Islam, and perhaps before it (Hitti 1937: lOOf.), has been called Allah. The source of good and evil is depicted by the bedouins as he who grants either latitude (wusa6) or constriction (dhig), latitude being identified with the good because of its association with spacious grazing lands and free- dom of movement in search of new pastures. Thus a bedouin poet in north- west Sinai begins a poem: Yã Allah, tilt bi-amrak al-wusa* wadh-dhig wa inak tiwassï'hâ balash az-zulãmih O Allah, according to your order, life is either wide or narrow And if you decree it be wide, there will be no wrong.22 To dispose Allah toward granting him a spacious existence, a bedouin is careful to demonstrate his appreciation of God's bountifulness on every occasion. One way is to "whiten his face" (yibayyidh wijh Allah). When, for 20 The poem was composed by 'Anayz Salim Swaylim al-'Araydhah of the Tarã- bín Hasablih but was recited to the author by 'Owdah Sãlih Imbãrak of the Muzaynah Ra- wãhlah at Wãdí Gharandãl in south-west Sinai, in November 1968. In the bedouin dialect ghayr means "must; garat means to throw. 22 The composer of the poem, Sabâh Sãlih al-Ghãnim, of the 'Ugaylï tribe recited it to the author on October 24, 1970 at Rab'ah oasis in north-west Sinai.</page><page sequence="10">74 Clinton Bailey Anthropos 77.1982 example, a bedouin celebrates a holiday or private event- such as a wedding or circumcision- he flies a white flag (rãyah baydhã) over his tent, to ac- knowledge that there would be no celebrations but for the goodness of God. The custom, perhaps an anthropomorphic assimilation, may be borrowed from daily interpersonal relations, whereby a bedouin flies a white flag to enhance the reputation of someone who has done him an extraordinary favor. Dikr Allah, "bearing God in mind," is another means of currying favor with the Almighty by constantly reaffirming his omnipotence as opposed to man's insignificance. Whenever one plans, embarks upon, or completes, an enterprise- whether major (a raid, a journey) or minor (a meal)- one remem- bers to invoke the name of Allah as the aegis of the enterprise. Bedouins, therefore, never make plans without saying in shã Allah, "if God wills," or tawakkul Allah, "with trust in God." When beginning an action they say, bismillah ar-rahmãn ar-rahïm, "I do this in the name of Allah, the merciful and compassionate," and when finishing they say al-hamd lillah, "may Allah be praised." A third and highly revered means of pleasing God is the ancient custom of giving him gifts, particularly by sacrificing the bedouin's most cherished possession- his livestock. Sometimes the gift is made directly to "the face (i.e., honor) of God" (wijh Allah); at others, to various intermediaries. In the former case, the bedouin upon cutting the victim's throat says: Yã wijh Allah al-kartm Hay di minak wa tirja' lak O honorable and bountiful God this victim has come from you and is returning to you.23 Unless it is specifically a "holiday sacrifice" (dhahïyah 'ïdïyah) per- formed on the Muslim festivals, a sacrifice made directly to God is called fadawt, meaning "a ransom" (cf. Hebrew cognate pidy on). By presenting this gift to Allah, the bedouin hopes to ransom from danger, or ensure the well- being of things dear to him, such as his children, his flocks, or his tent. To specify what he is ransoming, moreover, he daubs it (yihannih) with the vic- tim's blood. Sacrifices offered as thanksgiving when danger has been averted are also called fadawi, the intention being to ransom the objects that have already experienced relief from future danger too.24 The bedouins also give sacrificial gifts to various intermediaries in an attempt to influence the source of good and evil indirectly; indeed, this is their chief religious ritual. The most highly considered intermediaries are the 23 The author first heard this prayer among the Tiyãhã al-'Awämrah in east- central Sinai. It seems to be common to all the bedouins of Sinai and the Negev. 24 Cf. Doughty (1888/1: 499) who relates that a bedouin host once sent him the meat of a goat he had sacrificed for the health of a sick camel, claiming that "now. . . [the camel] will certainly begin to amend." See also Jaussen 1908: 36 Iff.</page><page sequence="11">Bedouin Religious Practices 75 'ulyã or 'ulãyã (sing, will or wall), dead saints believed to be close (adj., wall) to Allah.25 To qualify as a will after death, one must show evidence of en- joying God's special blessing (barakah), which, among bedouins, may be ma- nifest even in secular success, including the attainment of wealth by raiding or smuggling26. Any material success under desert conditions is deemed ex- traordinary. Thus, we find, too, that the wilt is often a tribal ancestor, who was presumably wealthy enough to practice polygamy, begot numerous children, and set the basis thereby for a large kinship group which ultimate- ly formed the nucleus of a tribe.27 Other 'ulyã are reputed to have had unusually spiritual personalities or to have performed supernatural deeds. Shaykh Zuwayyid whose tomb is in northeastern Sinai could fill a food bowl by merely looking at it.28 Shaykh al-A'sam at 'Aslüj in the Negev could walk great distances in a short time al- though he was lame.29 Shaykh Humayd at Nuwayba4 at-Tarâbîn on the coast of the Gulf of 'Aqabah, sustained, during years of prolonged drought, the women and children of seven families whose men had deserted them in despair.30 At the head of Wãdf al-Akhaydhir in Jabal Ya'laq (in western Si- nai), is the shrine of the forefather of the Ahaywãt Safãyhah tribe, Sulaymãn al-Mijrib, who died under miraculous circumstances. He and his people were migrating from southern Sinai where they had quarrelled with the Muzay- nah. It was summer and when he suddenly died, there was no accessible wa- ter with which to wash his corpse. Suddenly a single cloud appeared in the sky releasing rain on the spot where the little group sat fretting. Then, as 25 The noted Qur'änic commentator al-Baydhãwí (d. 1286 A.D.) defined the 'ulyã as "those who are near to God through their obedience, and whom God equips with the gift of his mercy" (quoted by Goldziher 1971/11: 264). 26 The author witnessed such a wili in the making. Shaykh Sulaymãn Salïm Mu- haysin, of the Tarãbín as Saray'ah, had been a renowned smuggler who provided employ- ment for many bedouins in his smuggling networks. After his death in 1973 his tribesmen began constructing a domed tomb over his grave, at Nuwayba* at-Tarãbín, to serve as a shrine (mazar; lit., visiting place). Musil (1928: 419f.) tells of a wili in the Syrian desert whose claim to holiness was that he "undertook countless raids and returned from them all." (For an extensive study oibarakah, see Westermarck 1926/1: 35-261). Among the 'ulyã who are considered tribal forefathers one could mention Sal- man Abü Sãkhnah of the 'Azãzmah Sawãkhnah in the central Negev; Swaylim, of the 'Ayãl Swaylim section of the 4Azãzmah Sarãhín, buried at 'Ayn Gudayrãt in eastern Sinai; Shaykh Farãnjah of the Muzaynah confederation in southern Sinai; Shaykh 'Atï- yah of the Tarãbín confederation in Wadi Watir; Nijm of the Uhaywãt Nijmãt at Bïr as- Sinnï in central Sinai; Sa'úd of the 'Ayãydah confederation on the 'Ijmah plateau; Nasrãl- lah of the Huwaytãt Fara'íyah, at 'Ayn Hijïyah in central Sinai; and Humayd Abü Jurayr of the Suwãrkah Jurayrãt, west of Jabal Maghãrah in northern Sinai. 28 Shaykh Zuwayyid zãd aUbãtyih bi-'aynih.- Communication from Shaykh Salã- mah 'Awwäd Mas'üd of the Suwãrkah Zuyüd.

Two distinct signs were thus given that Sulaymãn al-Mijrib's grave should be a shrine.31 Some shrines admittedly contain no more than the spirit of the holy man, such as that of 'Alï Abu Tâlib in Wãdi §ulãf in southern Sinai. Long ago, when attacked by raiders, the ancestors of the Owlãd Sa'îd prayed to 4 Alï Abu Tãlib, the Muslim Prophet's son-in-law, to help them. When their camels turned into white stones which the raiders ignored, they realized that their prayers had been answered. Therefore, they built at that spot a shrine to which the Owlãd Sa'ïd make a yearly tribal pilgrimage.32 Bedouins are careful to make at least one annual pilgrimage (ziyãrah; lit., "visit") to the shrine of a will. Some "visits" are traditionally tribal, en- tailing dozens of families holding their pilgrimage on a designated day,33 but most are made in small groups, often just the limited family. In either case the intermediate intention of the ziyãrah and the offering (ziwãrah) are the same: to demonstrate "submission to the saint" (takhdhV an-nafs lil-wilï) and "to curry his favor" (at-tagarrub minih)34. The prayer the bedouins utter upon slaughtering the ziwãrah indicates their overall goal, which is to ask for intercession. On a pilgrimage with the 'Azãzmah to Salman Abü Sákhnah, in the Negev, the author heard it pronounced thus: Ya Abü Sãkhnah, hay dì ziwãrtak O, Abü Säkhnah, this sacrificial victim is yours. indakhkhilhi 'alayk We are placing her under your protection; wa inta dãkhil 'ala mowlak You, who enjoy the protection of the lord. At that, the bedouin slits the animal's throat letting the aortal blood spurt out on the tomb, or nearby, "as a sign" ('alãmah) that he has perform- ed the slaughter. If, however, he wishes to slaughter the animal elsewhere, he will suffice with amputating the animal's ear (jad' al-widin) and dripping its blood (towkif ad-dam) on the tomb.

He hopes that they, too, will intercede on his behalf.35 The sacrifice is thus seen as enabling him tc "en- gage the services of his ancestor" (yistãjir fï mayyitih), according 'o the dictum: Lugimtayn fi batn jãy a ' Two morsels in a hungry belly tizãhirak yowm al-wigãya' will help you (lit., keep your back up) when you fall. The bedouin believes that the ancestor shares in the sacrificial meal. Every Thursday night (the eve of the holy day) during Ramadhãn, for example, the bedouin offers his ancestors a sacrifice of "bread soaked with clarified but- ter" (fatt bi-samn), the bread in accordance with the alliterative injunction: 'ãsh wãldayk min ma hãshin ïdayk, "sup your parents with what your hands have gathered." Indeed, the sacrifice itself is called "commensality" (mi- lãb).36 As a rule, however, the sacrifice is a slaughtered head of livestock, the bedouin's dearest possession. The first such sacrifice is offered the day an immediate kinsman dies. It is called idfãnah (the "burial" sacrifice) if the funeral takes place that day, and irsãdah (the "vigil" sacrifice) if the person has died in the evening and the funeral is to be held on the morrow. After the Islamic, forty-day period of mourning the ma 'ãzí ("condolence") sacri- fice is offered; and on the day preceding 'Id al-Adhhãf a sacrifice called dhahiyit 'id al-mawãt (the sacrifice of the Feast of the Dead) is made for those who died within the past year.37 Another ritual petition to an intermediary, thought to be Hellenistic m origin,38 is the visit to 'ülyä who have no tomb. They are "the Men of the Land and the Sea" (rijãl al-barr wal-bahr) who reside in the Mediterranean, and are venerated by the tribes that engage in fishing along Sinai's northern coast. Each autumn they come to the coast where they immerse themselves, their livestock, and their tents in the shallow water and slaughter a goat be- 35 Communication from Swaylim Abu Bilaya of the 'Azãzmah SarãhTn. For an analysis of ancestor sacrifice in Islam, in general, see Goldziher 1967: 209-238. The author first witnessed this ritual among the 'Azãzmah Sarahin and the 'Azãzmah 'Asíyãt in January, 1972. The bedouins present at the ritual considered that the butter on their hands served as a sign to their ancestors- who witness it in a dream (ury ã) -that they have not been derelict in their obligation. 37 The preceding information on sacrifices for the dead was communicated to the author by members of the 'Azãzmah Sarãhín and 'Azãzmah 'Asíyãt. However , two informants-Muslih Sãlim Sulaymãn Ibn 'Ãmr of the Tiyãhã Sugayrãt and Humayd Salmãn as-Saddãn of the 'Azãzmah Sarahîn-considered the irfidah sacrifice contrary to Islam (and thus improper), because it takes place before the deceased has received his due; namely, a burial. 38 An Israeli historian, Barslavi (1946: 295-298), argued that the sacrifice to the sea is a Dionysian rite performed at Rafah during the Hellenistic period.</page><page sequence="14">78 Clinton Bailey Anthropos 77.1982 fore emerging. Then they wrap its feet, entrails, and head in the skin, which they throw into the sea, crying, Hadã 'ashãk yã bahr, 'This is your dinner, O Sea". 39 Urn al-Ghayt, "the Mother of Rain," is another ancient will without a shrine, to whom the bedouins appeal when the winter rains are late in com- ing. First they create her in effigy by draping a white cloth over crossed sticks decorated with colored tassels and embroidered strips. They next slaughter an animal and daub the doll with its blood. Then the women carry it around the camp singing: Yã sãyig al-matar, süg It matar, "You who drive the rain forward, drive the rain to me"; or Um al-Ghayt, ghíttnã O Mother of Rain, send rain upon us Billi towb ra'tna Moisten the dress of our shepherd. ° c) Agents of Evil Despite his considerable efforts to predispose Allah in his favor the con- tinued occurrence of evil must evidently puzzle the bedouin no less than other members of the human family. Like them, therefore, bedouin society has developed the concept of agents of evil, animate and inanimate, from which much of the world's evil is presumed to derive. Being able to identify these agents, and perhaps take action against their evil, is in itself a relief to the bedouin, imbuing him with a sense of control over his destiny. The evil eye, 'ayn al-hãsid (lit., the eye of an envious person), is one such agent of evil. According to the bedouin the evil eye is possessed by a person whom God wishes to punish by making him "discontent with his lot" (mish miktafi bir-rizig Uli 'indih).41 Such a person, his heart divested of faith, is depicted as "empty-hearted" (galbih fãdhí) or, more commonly, "empty-souled" (fãrigh an-nafs). The void thus created is filled by Satan (ash-shaytãn) who enters his heart and "distracts him from the thought of Allah's bountifulness" (yisallth min dikr Allah); that is, he makes him en- vious. No longer guided by God, moreover, the envious person is harmful, especially by casting a "glance of the eye" (ghushsh al-'ayn). The bedouins are ever fearful of encounters with an evil eye. In their opinion, "most deaths arise from people [with the evil eye] whereas few come from God directly" (aghlab al-manãyã min an-nãs; galli al-wähad yi- müt min Allah). Similarly, a bedouin proverb holds that "most graves are 39 The author witnessed this visit to the sea by bedouins of the Suwãrkah con- federation at Bardawîl on September 5, 1973. Cf. Shuqayr 1916: 354; Canaan 1927: passim ; Murray 1935: 156f. 0 The author witnessed this rite among the 'Azãzmah Sarahïn in the central Ne- gev in January, 1977. Cf. Musil 1908/III: 8ff.;Jaussen 1908: 3 23-330; Murray 1935: 156. 41 The following information regarding the evil eye was initially communicated to the author by Humayd Imsallam of the Muzaynah Darãrmah (southern Sinai) and Sãlim 4Alï Abú Julaydãn of the 'Azãzmah 'Asïyat (Negev). (cf.Westermarck 1926/1: 414-478; Blackman 1927: 21 8-222 ;Jaussen 1908: 376-380; Baldensperger 1893û: 216.</page><page sequence="15">Bedouin Religious Practices 79 the result of envy in people's hearts" (aktar al-gubur min as-sudür). There- fore, they take precautions, particularly in regard to persons thought to have the evil eye, persons whose presence has preceded past misfortunes. When approached by such a person a bedouin will, for example, extend an open right hand in his direction and mumble the following curse: Ikhsa ilayk; hadd Allah min sharrak, "Be off; may Allah avert your evil." On the other hand, any well-intentioned bedouin, lest he, himself, unwittingly be carrying the evil eye, says upon approaching another's children or live- stock, Dikr Allah 'alayhum, " I invoke the name of Allah upon them." This is considered the best protection against the evil eye as "Satan fears nothing but the name of Allah" (ash-shaytãn mã biykhãfilã min ism Allah). Invoking the name of God belongs to a category of actions employed against the evil eye called khizi ash-shay tan, "confounding the devil." For example, bedouins often refrain from naming a male infant (tasmïyit al-wa- lad) during its first year lest they attract the attention of an evil eye. For the same reason small male children are disguised as females by dressing them in a woman's bonnet (ugah; diminutive for a child's bonnet, wigãyah), females rarely being the objects of envy. Another device is to fasten a sprig of the Capparis Decidua (Ar. tundub, alternately shundub) to a child's bonnet. Because the root of the name, n-d-bt is derived from the image of "lamentation," it confounds the evil eye by giving the impression that evil has already befallen, and there remains nothing to covet. Yet a further device is to hang the bones of dead animals on treasured objects.42 Among the less ubiquitous agents of evil in the desert are the witches (sing., ghülah) that inhabit caves and mountain crags. They take on the form of women who devour men and boys- after enticing the former and snatch- ing the latter- the victims being single bedouins travelling and camping alone. To overcome a ghülah, a bedouin must outsmart, and then kill, her. Several stories, heard among the Tarãbín in southern Sinai relate the victory of cunning bedouins over their female assailants.43 Accursed landmarks may also be agents of evil, embodying spirits that afflict passers-by who are not on their guard. For example, in Nagb ar-Rak- nah, the main pass that joins southern and central Sinai, stands a large square rock (eight square meters) near which many camels are said to have thrown their riders.44 Similarly, whenever bedouins in the Negev used to make pil- grimage to the tomb of 'Umrï in Wâdï al-Abyadh, they met with unsuitable 42 The author witnessed a camel's bones attached to diesel motors used to draw water from deep wells at 'Ayn Um Ahmad Oasis, and at BIr al-'Ugdah, both in south-east Sinai. 43 One such story pertained to the snatching of a boy into a cave called Juhrit al- Ghülah near 'Ayn Um Ahmad; it was related by Sãlim Sulaymãn Salïm Ibn San'. Another story pertaining to an attempt to seduce a lone bedouin near the tomb of Shaykh 'Atïyah in WadrWatïr was related to the author by 'Anayzãn Sãlim Swaylim al-'Araydhah. The author visited this rock on April 5, 1971, in the company of Shaykh 'Ubaydãllah Salãm 'Owdah of the 'Ulaygãt Zumaylïyïn (south-west Sinai).</page><page sequence="16">80 Clinton Bailey Anthropos 77.1982 weather and resultant mishaps. Hence, to be safe from the evil spirits at these places, a bedouin must show his mettle. It is considered incumbent on the passer-by to stone them, curse them, and, if possible, even defecate and urinate upon them (al-'Arif 1933:263f.). d) Taboos Like agents of evil, taboos, too, are apparently designed to make a be- douin feel that he possesses some control over his fate. By refraining from breaking a taboo a bedouin believes that he spares himself undue trouble. If, for example, he does not wish to die on the spot he will be careful not to fell a terebinth trçe (butum; lat. Pistacia Atlantica)45. To avoid falling ill, he will even refrain from trimming certain other trees.46 Another form of taboo is the period of interdiction, during which a be- douin is forbidden to undertake new initiatives- journeys, raids, even sexual relations with one's wife- lest the outcome be unfortunate. Such periods occur once a month from June through October, when the moon is seen against the background of the Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius constellations. The name of the period is as-smayyih, reflecting its duration of seven nights each month, samh being a bedouin euphemism for the Arabic word for seven (sabas) (Bailey 1974 è:592 ff.). Other bedouin taboos relate to ritual impurity {najãsah) which comes from contact with elements containing the essence of life e.g., blood, seminal excretions, or animals that have human qualities. According to the be- douins, for example, anyone who has had contact with seminal excretions (janãbah) either through sexual intercourse or auto-ejaculation, is impure (nijis) and must neither touch human beings, nor pray, without first bathing his body. If he touches another person, that person may become ill and per- haps die; if he should pray in this condition he will incur the displeasure of Allah.47 A menstruating woman is also nijis and her very presence may cause harm to people with open wounds such as wounded men (musawwa- btn), circumcised children (mushawwahtn at-tuhür; lit., those deformed by circumcision) or women after childbirth. The latter, if visited by a menstru- ating woman may henceforth become barren (makbüsah; lit., attacked) 48.

Animals with human traits are nijis and must not be touched. Bedouins refrain, in particular from petting dogs, although these are necessary for guarding the flocks. The explanation is that "the dog is of the same clay as a human being (al-kalb min tïnit ibn adam); he eats people's food, drinks their water, enters their tent und gards them"49. Similarly, bedouins refrain from eating the meat of wild animals with features or characteristics that seem human. A porcupine (anís), for example, is considered "like a person; his hand is a child's hand, and his ear is the ear of a human being" (hü zay al- insãn; yadih y ad al-'ayil, u widnih widin ibn adam).50 The owl (bümah; lat. Athena Noctrina) is also taboo being endowed with human intelligence (rãsih milyãn; "his head is full")51. e) Belief in the Power of Magic Prevalent among the bedouins, in their attempt to control destiny and the environment by supernatural means, is the recourse to magic. Although the means are many, they generally fall into the two categories defined by the English anthropologist, James Frazer. The first, sympathetic magic, holds that nature can be influenced through the medium of like objects, objects that look, sound, or act alike. The second category, contagious magic, holds that things which have once been in contact continue even afterwards to act on each other." While a catalogue of bedouin magical practices would be exhaustive, some examples will illustrate the nature of their application. Three amulets (haraz; sing., harazah, from the verb yihriz, "to protect") may be worn as prophylactics against the evil eye because of their resem- blance to an eye: a cowrie shell (wada') because of its shape; a blue stone, because blue eyes are particularly dangerous; and a lump of alum (shabbih) 49 Communication from Humayd Salman of the 'Azãzmah Sarãhm. 50 Communication from Sãlim 'Alï Sãlim Abu Julaydan of the 'Azazmah 'Asïyat. The bedouins have a legend that the original porcupine was the transformation of a man called Khamïs ("five") who underwent this metamorphosis as punishment for washing his hands with camel milk, an act which angered the anbtyã (prophets). Hence the hands with the five fingers remained part of the porcupine's physique to remind bedouins that Allah gave them camel's milk specifically to "sustain them from starvation" (yigithum "an al- mowt). 51 Communication from Swaylim Abu Bilãyã of the * Azazmah Sarahïn. A be- douin legend relates that when the Prophet summoned all the birds, the owl refused to come until a dog was sent to fetch her. When asked why she deigned to come only with a dog, she said gïmtïzay gïmit al-kalb, "my worth is the worth of a dog." Frazer 1959: 35ff.- All but one of the following examples of magical devices were initially communicated to the author by his closest associates among the 'Azãzmah Sarahïn and 'Azãzmah 'Asryãt tribes of the central Negev, and all were known to mem- bers of other tribes with whom the author discussed them. Anthropos 77.1982 6</page><page sequence="18">82 Clinton Bailey Anthropos 77.1982 because its translucense resembles the substance of the eyeball.53 Other cures for various disorders are also based on visual similarity. To cure a purulent sore (hibin), for example, a stone called hùbinïyah, containing white spots (resembling puss) surrounded by red lines (resembling blood), is worn on a string around the neck. Worn around the neck, too, a piece of bone- coral ( imshãshah; lit., a marrow bone) is used to induce lactation in nursing- mothers, it being believed that the open passages of the coral have a salubrious effect on the passages in a woman's breast. To cure a sore eye, a bedouin hangs a coin with a hole in the middle from his head-cloth just over the side of the eye. Similarly, any gold object may serve as an amulet against the ill effects of contact with a menstruating woman, such as post pregnancy sterility (kabsih). Menstruation being a monthly occurrence, the source of its danger is conceived of as residing in the moon. Hence, gold jewellery or coins, resembling the golden visage of the moon, may nullify its ill effects.54 The dried head of a horned viper (rãs al-hayyah al-magrünah)ss is worn around one's neck in a little leather pouch as an amulet against a "run of bad luck" (garinah; lit., that which keeps parallel to one). As the term garinah is derived from the image of parallel in the Arabic root g-r-n, the parallel horns (gam; pl., gurün) on the viper's head are considered an effective antidote to bad luck. Grindstones (rahï), which are parallel too, are also used to combat a garïnah, although too heavy to wear as an amulet. If, for example, a be- douin's flock is blighted and, every few days, another ewe dies, he may place his upper and nether grindstones on opposite sides of a flat wâdï, and have the flock pass between them. The importance of rhyme in an unlettered society manifests itself in the prevalence of amulets and cures used because they rhyme with a partic- ular harm-phenomenon that the bedouin wishes to overcome. For example, a piece of flintstone (sawwãn) is often tied to an infant's bonnet because it rhymes with "women" (niswãn). Hence, the bedouins say, as-sawwãn fi 'uyün an-niswañ, "flintstone against the (evil) eyes of women." Similarly, 53 According to the same concept of sympathetic magic, shabbih is used in divining the person who cast an evil eye, because,when placed near a fire, it changes shape, taking on forms which indicate whether the person is male or female, aged or young. Cf. Murray (1935 : 168f.) for the use of gold against the afflictions of the moon in northern Sudan. Marx (1973: 424) states that the bedouins consider it propitious to perform a circumcision on the night of the full moon. While Marx offers no explanation for this belief, one wonders if the "golden" full moon in itself, may not be considered an antidote to its own influence via menstruating women. 55 Lat. Cerastes Cornutus. The word hayyah is a generic term for snake. While the Arabic dictionaries attribute its derivation to the root h-y-yy meaning "to live"(e.g., al- Munjid, Beirut 1969; Hava 1915; Wehr 1966), it is more probable that hayyah derives from the root fr-xv-y, meaning to "curl up" which is characteristic of a viper. Morphologi- cally, this would be similar to the noun layyah from the root l-w-y, meaning to "coil up." Layyah, which in general means "a coil" is, in Egypt, a colloquial term for snake, as well.</page><page sequence="19">Bedouin Religious Practices 83 crushed leaves of the tar f ah tree (lat. Tamarix Nilotica) are an ingredient in a cure for the scratched eye (tarfat al-'ayn) of a camel, for no ostensible reason other than the similarity in the names. By the same token, a cure for warts (talül) is to cover them with "underground dust" (trãb mazlùl) from an "anonymous grave" (gabr majhül). The Arabic name of King Solomon- Sulaymãn ibn Da'üd (the son of David)- is itself an antidote against snakes because it rhymes with the word for reptiles: düd. Owing to this rhyme, the bedouin imagination has extended King Solomon's legendary influence over animals to an ability "to tame reptiles" (hü aljam ad-düd). 56 Thus, when bedouins sleep on unfamiliar ground they add the following formula to their prayers: Allah al-mughayyir May Allah who effects every change yighayyif ad-düd change the course of the serpent taht al-hasã al-jamüd neath the solid pebbly surface dikr Sulaymãn ibn Da'üd in memory of Solomon, David's son. Objects that contain qualities, or act in ways, similar to a desired effect, may also be used to attain it. Bedouins' who have trouble hearing, for exam- ple, hang a small sea-shell from their skull-caps behind their ear. This amulet (called mãdinah, "the place of the ear"), legendarily conveying the sound of the distant sea, is thought to have a salubrious effect on a plugged ear. Like- wise, bee's honey, being ever moist, is fed to a nursing infant in order to immunize him against excessive thirst. God's word, the greatest antidote to evil, constitutes an amulet in the form of Qur'anic quotations written down and placed in a leather pouch. This particular kind of amulet, called a hijãb (lit., that which shelters), is worn as protection against any kind of bad luck.57 Traditionally auspicious numbers, such as seven and forty, are also thought to be connected with beneficial phenomena. A widespread cure for sundry physical maladies is al-arba'ïnt"ihe forty," consisting of the juices and saps of forty species of plants mixed with olive oil and clarified butter. In order to avoid post pregnancy sterility (kabsih) a new mother must wear gold for forty days as a prophylactic against menstruating women. A cure for kabsih, on the other hand, is for each of seven families to slaughter an ani- mal, mix the blood of the seven sacrifices (sab (ah adh-dhahãyã) with water, and bathe the afflicted woman (al-makbüsah) with this concoction on seven consecutive mornings (sabf sabãhãt). Likewise, the cure for an aching joint (fikãk) is to wrap a strand of camel hair (wabar) around it seven times. 56 See, e.g., 'Abd al-Wahhãb al-Najjãr (n.d.: 318-348) for popular Muslim stories about King Solomon's influence over animals. 7 Most bedouins being illiterate, the hijãb is prepared for them by a non-bedouin. One such acquaintance of the author was Mahmûd Muhammad Abu Badr, the member of a former peasant family from the Gaza area that lived among the Gudayrãt as-§ãni' sec- tion of the Tiyãhã (northern Negev).</page><page sequence="20">84 Clinton Bailey Anthropos 77.1982 The number five (khamsah) as represented, for example, by the five upright fingers of the extended hand may symbolize life and vitality, and as such, serves as an antidote against the evil eye. A bedouin proverb says, al- khams bi-mãl, wal-khams bi-rijãl, "five in capital and five in men." The ca- pital referred to is (1) winter wheat and barley (planted on the fringe of the desert) whose growing period is five months; (2) goats and sheep whose gestation period is five months; and (3) camels and horses whose pedigree must be certain and pure for five generations. The reference to men concerns the blood-revenge group (al-khams) in which co-liability pertains among men who have shared a common, male-line, ancestor within the past five genera- tions. These two elements (mal and rijäl) are the most vital in bedouin life. The bedouin also believes in the power of contagious magic, by which contact with an object can either immunize him against the dangers of an identical object or transfer to him the qualities of that object. To immunize a baby against the danger of scorpion sting, for example, scorpions ("three black, three yellow") are caught and burned. The ash is then applied to the mother's nipple when the child, a month old, is nursing. "After that," the bedouins say, "even if a child holds a scorpion in his hand and is bitten he will merely laugh it off, for the poison will cause him no pain." Simi- larly, to cure a child or an animal afflicted by an evil eye, a tiny piece is surreptitiously cut from the clothing of the person suspected of casting it. The cloth is then burned and the afflicted object made to inhale the smoke of the "burning piece" (ktür; akin to the Hebrew cognate qtõret, "in- cense"). Qualities and abilities may be acquired from contact with their sources, especially via the mouth. An infant may be endowed with strong intuition, for example, by imbibing a tiny morsel of a crow's heart as he suckles. His father will have caught a live crow, laid it on its back, quickly opened its chest and snatched out the heart. Crows, reputed to fly off before an ap- proaching enemy comes into view, are thought "to have an understanding of unseen things" (hü yifham al-ghayb). Hence bedouin parents are eager that "their child's heart be like the heart of a crow" (galbih zay galb al-gharãb). By the same token, a man may restore his sexual vigor by imbibing the dried and pulverized penis of a sea turtle (hagal) which "mates with the female sea turtle (wabsih) for forty days".58 The ability to suck poison from scorpion stings and minor snake- bites, hawãyah, is also transferred by mouth. For example, one elderly hawï59 related how he received his ability, when still a baby, from a hawï who, stopping off at his family's tent to rest, placed some of his spittle into the 58 Communications from two bedouin fishermen in the Gulf of 'Aqabah, 'Ãyd 'Awwãd Jum'ah of the Muzaynah Sakhãnah and Jum'ah 'Id Dakhilãllah of the Tarâbïn Hasãblah.

Snake-bite may also be overcome by drinking oil in which the skin of a monitor lizard (azlim; lat. Varanus Griseus) has been boiled. The thick-skinned azlïm, resident of the sand dune, is known by the bedouins for its imperviousness to snake- bite, as well as its ability to kill snakes with a blow from its horned tail. 3. Conclusion: Ancient Traditions Survive under Unchanging Conditions When a bedouin indulges in a non-Islamic practice, he does not do so in a spirit of deception. On the contrary, he is incredulous if not indignant when informed that what he is doing may be pagan; and he can produce "proof" that it is indeed part and parcel of Islam. When bedouins marry, for example, they dispense with the usual Islamic religious precepts and per- sonnel, marriage to them being more a social and political, rather than re- ligious event. The bedouin marriage ceremony consists of two parts. In the first, the betrothal ceremony, the father of the bride cuts a blade of grass or stalk of grain and hands "that which is cut" (al-gasalah) to the prospective groom. In the second, the sanctification (hillïyah) of the marriage, the groom sprinkles the blood of a sacrificial goat or sheep on his bride. Neither cere- mony is prescribed by Islam, but the formula, bi-sinnt Allah wa sinnt rasülih, "by the tradition of God and that of his apostle," is uttered with the perfor- mance of each (Bailey 1974a:113f., 126f.). Another non-Islamic custom the bedouins traditionally attribute to Is- lam is the milãb, the offering to one's ancestors of bread soaked in clarified butter, during the month of Ramadhãn. According to the bedouins "it is obligatory for the Muslim to commemorate his departed ones every Friday during Ramadhãn" (mahtüm (ãl-Mislim an yudkur mowtãh fî-kull Jum'ah fi Ramadhãn), because it is "required by the Qur'an" (dhurüñ fil-kitãb).60 Both the above practices, however, antedate Islam. The gasalah be- trothal ceremony is the biblical "cutting of a covenant",61 appropriate be- cause marriage between bedouins, in the present as in the past, is primarily the formation of a covenant between families. Equally biblical is the exten- sion of the hands toward the new moon-already considered pagan in the book of Job (31:26-27)-and the use of the blood sacrifice to propitiate God.62 Similarly, the bedouin's use of oil in the milãh offering as a sign of covenant between himself and his ancestors may be a direct descendant of the scar of circumcision which served as a sign of covenant between Abra- ham and God (Genesis 17:11-13); or later, of two Arabian bedouins who would mark their covenant by wiping oily hands on the pre -Islamic Ka'bah (Robertson Smith 1903: 58; cf. note 36 supra). 60 Communication from Swaylim Abü Bilãya of the 'Azãzmah Sarãhln. 61 Heb., kritat brït (Deut. 34:27 -Joshua 4:7; Samuel 1, 18:3; Nehemia 10:1).

The ritual was called mihãsh, "marked with scars'' (Robertson Smith 1889: 479f.). Later, but still in the pre-Islamic period, blood was replaced by the use of some type of unguent (idãm, as it is still called today) in the forming of a covenant. 63 Bedouin fatalism is also inherited from the pre-Islamic period, and although it became a notable characteristic of Islam, itself, it is more pro- bable that Islam adopted the bedouin attitude to life rather than the oppo- site (Ringgren 1955: 86f. et passim). The prophet Muhammad, impressed by the Judeo-Christian concept of a Day of Judgement, preferred the Arabians to believe that their ultimate destiny depended on the correctness of their own religious behaviour; but the predisposition to fatalism among the Arabian bedouins reportedly proved stronger (Gibb 1949: 38ff.). Even the imagery of fatalism is largely unchanged from what it was in pre-Islamic times (Ringgren 1955: 9-29, 63-68, 86-95). The word for fate, manTyah (pl., manãyã), was current then, too (cf. the Hebrew cognate manah, "portion"), and one of the known deities of ancient Arabia, the goddess of destiny, was indeed called al-Manãh. Similarly, the pre-Islamic image of "ropes of fate " (asbãb al-manãyã) still enjoys currency among contemporary bedouins as in the proverbs: lã manly ah bala asbãb, "there is no death without ropes," i.e., without being fated, and hull sabab min Allah, "each fate comes from God"?4 Other examples from the ancient terminol- ogy of fatalism that are in use today, are ajal wi-kitãb, "the preordained time," and magadïr (pl. of migdãr, "measure"), which may also be found in bedouin proverbs. For example, ma yinhã imgaddarãt as-sow ilã bulúgh-hã means "nothing stops fated evil except its occurrence." Even the contempo- rary bedouin's attempts to change his fate by propitiating God were current before Islam, including the practice of "remembering God's name" (dikr Allah). Hence, pre-Islamic bedouins embarking upon an enterprise are thought to have uttered "in the name of al-Lãt," or "in the name of al- 'Uzzah" (Shorter Encyclopaedia of Islam 1953: "Basmallah"). From the foregoing it is amply evident that, stimulated by the desert in which the bedouin continues to dwell, his fears and the means he employs to alleviate them have remained largely unchanged from what they were in pre-Islamic times. Fatalism, propitiation, the quest for intercession, the in- vention of agents of evil, and the recourse to magic have all been practices In Sinai and the Ncgev, the contemporary bedouins signify the covenant with their ancestors by using oil mixed with bread or grain-cereal. The addition of grain-cereal may have arisen from a corruption of the name of the ancient scar-ritual, mihãsh, to mã flash, "what is gathered," as in the dictum 'ãsh xvãldaykmin mã has hin idayk, "sup your parents from what your hands have gathered," i.e., grain. The present author once mistranslated a line of contemporary bedouin poetry, ghadã bi-asbãb, as "he's gone and there's a reason," whereas the correct translation should be: "he has been caught in the snares of fate" (see Bailey 1972: 84f.).</page><page sequence="23">Bedouin Religious Practices 87 endemic to the desert environment in which Islam, ironically, was born. The existence of these environment-oriented practices not only reflects the be- douin will to contend with the dangers of the desert, but their survival near- ly intact for almost one thousand four-hundred years, and under conditions of non-coercion, also indicates that they have served the bedouins well.
