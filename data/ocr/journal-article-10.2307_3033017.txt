<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ethiopian Famine Cultural Survival's new Report RICHARD PANKHURST Ethiopia, which was hit in the mid-1980s by a highly publicized famine, is, as U4ited Nations figures show, ond of the poorest countries in the world. It is, however, the recipient per capita of virtually the least foreign investment and long-term development aid. International assistance has tended to flow from European 'metropolitan' powers to their former colonies and dependencies: Ethiopia has as a result been punished for the crime of maintaining her age-old independence. This economically underprivileged condition has been intensified in recent years by the Cold War, for several Western powers - who provide the country with 9/lOths of all development assistance - have denied, or strictly curtailed, development aid to Ethiopia because of her current military dependence on the Soviet Union. Another consequence of Ethiopia's current international alignment has been the excessive politicization of famine on the part of some western writers, who, like the authors of the publication by Cultural Survival Inc. reviewed here, Politics and the Ethiopian Famine, 1984-1975 (Jason W Clay and Bonnie K. Holcomb, $10), seem more intent on discrediting the present Ethiopian government than on producing an objective assessment of tho famine. The historical introductio -i, which is supposed to place this Cultural Survival report in context, displays little grasp of the subject, and is marred by many inaccuracies, only few of which, for reasons of space, may be mentioned. The authors, who seem to forget the unifying efforts of Emperors Tewodros and Yohannes, assert (p 7) that Emperor Menilek was the 'first' to envisage an Ethiopian empire. They go on to remark (p 15) that prior to his reign, the title of King of Kings had been 'primarily' claimed by Tigrayans. This claim was in fact made by only one Tigrayan - Menilek's immediate predecessor Yohannes, whereas it was made by a succession of Ethiopian monarchs since the medieval period. Coming to more recent times Clay and Hoilcomb observe (p 17) that 'accounts of Haile Selassie's return to Addis Ababa in the 1940s indicate that the Wollo Oromo spat on him as he passed through their areas', which would seem to have been a difficult feat as his journey did not take him within a hundred miles of Wollo. It is further stated (p 12) that the British, after reinstating him on the throne, 'even shaped the new constitution' which is therefore dubbed an 'imported' one (p 15). This constitution, which was not promulgated until 1955 - 14 years after the liberation - was actually drafted in Addis Ababa by a high level Ethiopian committee, and the only foreign advisers, as explained by one of their number (Spencer 1984), were not British, but American. Clay and Holcomb, who seem oblivious of the fact that the United Nations federated Eritrea with Ethiopia, assert, once again entirely incorrectly, that the former Italian colony was a United Nations 'mandate' (p 15) whose 'independence' was scheduled according to a United Nations timetable! (p 14). Such confusion sets the tone for the remainder of the work, much of which is based in hearsay rather than serious research. We read for example (p 5) that the Ethiopian population has been variously estimated at between 32 and 45 million, and that assessment has 'always been more an art than a science! It would, however, have required little scientific rigour to discover that an Ethiopian census was taken in 1984, and that the first volume, published that year, gave a population figure of 42 million, which should at least be cited. The main body of the work sets out to present an independent account of the famine of 1984-5. However, despite lip-service (p,25) to the 'debate over the nature of refugee testimony' and an acceptance that 'information derived from refugees provides only a part of a complex picture' the report in fact relies almost entirely on refugees, and fails to consider the growing body of literature on famine. The so-called 'scholars and specialists' statements about the causes of famine' (p 31) turn out to be no more than newspaper reports and statements by 'liberation fronts', while the classic works on famine, such as those of A. Sen (1981) and Mesfin Wolde Mariam (1984) as well as countless others (see J. Seeley's bibliography of 1986), are ignored. Nor is any significant use made of reports by the many non- governmental organizations operating in the country, nor of United Nations agencies, let alone of the Ethiopian government's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission. A semblance of academic respectability and impartiality is conjured up by the use of statistics. Scrutiny of this data however gives rise to some concern. The researchers spent only two months in Sudan, much of which was occupied in travelling between sites. Only 250 people were interviewed, and no more than 100 interviews were random. Most of the samples were too small to be meaningful, for example we learn (p 106) that 6.7% of a sample of 15 persons, i.e. one individual, was a woman. No less remarkably it is stated (p 75) that only one person from Shoa and one from Gondar were interviewed, and that they were therefore 'lumped together under the category "Wollo etc" - but we are not told how many interviewees were from Wollo. In several cases questions were not asked to the full sample. We read (p 89) that 60% of those interviewed had seen people die, but the 'remainder were not asked the question' - so that, as the report observes with faultless if dubious logic, 'everyone asked the question had seen people die' Another problem with the information collected is that it is not always explained. There is for example no attempt to indicate why the Tigrayan refugees (p 77) were 20 years older, i.e. twice as old, as those from Wollo. Another weakness arises from the fact that refugees were on occasion interviewed in groups, so that, for example, (p 43) men answered 'even when questions were Dr. Richard Pankhurst is a scholar of Ethiopian affairs with a particular interest in the historical dimension to famine. Five of his articles on famine, originally published between 1961-1973, have recently been republished in a book entitled The History of Famine and Epidemics in Ethiopia prior to the Twentieth Century (2.50 from Central Books) by the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, Addis Ababa. Dr Pankhurst was formerly Director of the Institute of Ethiopian Studies, Addis Ababa University, and is presently Librarian of the Royal Asiatic Society. We note that the conclusions of a recent report by Survival International, entitled Ethiopia's Bitter Medicine: Settling for disaster, are very similar to those of Cultural Survival, in their view that 'Resettlement, far from being a humanitarian venture of famine relief is an immense exercise in ethnic engineering designed to "combat tribalism": to build national unity by dismantling ethnic differences.' Survival International quote (SI News No 11, 1985) the Ethiopian Government UN representative's reference to SI as a 'politically motivated organisation, acting as an instrument of bandits and terrorists echoing the propaganda of secessionalist elements against the unity and territorial integrity of my country'. An earlier report by SI, entitled Resettlement in Ethiopia: an Evaluation had been submitted to the UN sub- commission on the prevention of Discrimination and the 4</page><page sequence="2">directed to women only' Several omissions in the study are admitted by the authors themselves. They note for example, (p 18) that 'a grave weakness in our research design was introduced when we did not directly inquire about nationality in our survey. As a result we were unable to know how people from Wollo would identify themselves! More worrying is the use of case material presented out of context in the form of short statements which in fact often contradict the statistics. For example in the new camps in north-eastern Sudan Wad Kauli and Fau II, 900%7 and 1000%o respectively of the respondents are classed (p 47) as having fled because of drought, food shortage or insects, but most of the statements are selected to illustrate the argument that the flight was occasioned by Ethiopian Government policies. The report gives implicit, and uncritical, support to the Tigray People's Liberation Front in 'escorting' 100,000 'refugees' from Ethiopia to Sudan (p 42) and the resultant 'organized 'exodus' (p 51). Despite such attempts to play down natural factors, and to exaggerate political ones, a few statements reveal the economic nature of much cross-border migration. Particularly interesting in this respect is an informant quoted as saying (p 48) 'My village has had drought for six years. Two years ago I started working in Sudan, for three months. Last year I worked more. Now it's hard to work in Sudan at all, so I came as a refugee' Similarly, despite the loaded nature of many of the questionnaires, 93.70%o of respondents from Tigray and 66.407o of those from Wollo attributed the famine to drought and/or insect pests (p 84). Most of the text, as well as the case material quoted, seeks, on the contrary, to attribute decline in production to Ethiopian government policy. The report's dependence on dubious statistics, and apparently scarcely less reliable testimony from refugees, introduces a considerable degree of political bias. This can be illustrated in the discussion of death rates in resettlement centres. Though the authors admit that 'death rates must be treated with caution' they cite refugee estimates (p 99) of a daily mortality of 33 to 270 deaths per 10,000. They then take the lower figure, halve it, and halve it again, thereby reducing it by 7507o, and suggest that 50,000 to 100,000 settlers may have died by July 1985. They then conclude with the statement that 'refugees insisted that "Everyone will be dead or gone by next year"?' The weakness of reliance on poorly recorded testimony of refugees is likewise apparent from the false statement (p 99) that resettlement centres are 'comprised almost entirely of adults'. The report concludes with the argument, which is entirely unproven even by the researchers' own statistics, that famine in Ethiopia 'resulted primarily from government policies' which are 'establishing a social and economic system that will produce starving people for generations to come' (p 194-5). These allegations made in such an unscholarly publication are so one-sided and extreme that they can only be accounted for in terms of the selective use of data to support a preconceived political standpoint. The report at best provides a partial view, in both senses of the word, and is at worst a deliberate and systematic attempt to give only one side by omission and selective presentation. It is a travesty of scholarship. To give the authors their due they have not joined some critics of the current Ethiopian resettlement programme in accusing the Ethiopian Government of genocide or in likening the resettlement centres to Hitler's concentration camps. These charges, to those like the present reviewer who have seen the resettlement schemes, appear palpably disingenuous, and would seem to imply lack of understanding either of the Nazi camps or of Ethiopian resettlement policy. Hitler's camps, we should not forget, had one basic and overriding aim: the physical elimination of a people. The Ethiopian government scheme seeks to do the exact opposite: to save life by moving people from drought-stricken and soil-eroded areas of the north and centre of the country to the more fertile, and better-watered, south-west. Resettlement in Ethiopia was, it should be recalled, first proposed and planned by the World Bank, and it is surely not a coincidence that the implementation of this policy became a matter of American and other Western criticism only after the swing of international alliances on the Horn of Africa took Ethiopia out of the Western fold. Resettlement, which at most affects only 10% of the population of any region from which settlers are coming, represents only one of several policies presently being carried out by the Ethiopian Government, including among others: well-digging, dam-building, terracing, and reafforestation in the drought stricken areas. By far the largest number of settlers, contrary to some assertions, are not being transported from war- torn Tigray, but from the relatively peaceful regions of Wollo and Shoa. Ethiopia is a poor and economically underdeveloped country. Resettlement is therefore being carried out 'on a shoe-string', and the centres, like the country at large, face many difficulties - and shortages. Ill-informed criticism, like that of Cultural Survival, will not send the settlers back to their eroded homelands, but, if heeded, can only discourage the supply of aid to a country in which over six million people are expected to face famine this year. Agencies unhappy about conditions in the resettlement centres should respond to the Ethiopian Government's appeal by going in to help. Protection of Minorities at its session in August 1985.
