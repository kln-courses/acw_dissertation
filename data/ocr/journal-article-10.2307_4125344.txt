<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARINA KAPLAN Reading an Absent Sense: Tununa Mercado' s En estado de memoria "To write, 'to form,' in the informal, an absent sense. An absent sense (not an absence of sense, nor a sense that would be lacking, potential or latent). To write is perhaps to bring to the surface something like absent sense, to receive the passive impulse that is not yet thought, being already the disaster of thought. Its patience." -Maurice Blanchot, The Writing of the Disaster BLANCHOT'S QUOTATION IS ONE OF THREE epigraphs to Jean-Luc Nancy's book called, appropriately, The Sense of the World. Nancy's starting point in this study is to remind us that "sense" and "world" have a tautological relationship to each other and that both are becoming void of any meaning. Writing in 1997, and in France, he asserts that "there is no longer any assignable signification of 'world.' " Immanuel Wallerstein agrees with Nancy to the extent that he defines ours as an age of transition from one economic system-capitalism as we have known it-to a new one that is as yet undecipherable (63). Paul Bove, for his part, calls this same period "the interregnum" between state and super- state (or no state), a "place and time when there is as yet no rule, when there are ordering forces but they have not yet summoned their institutional rule into full view" (385). Whether philosophically, economically, or politically, then, the "sense of the world" is "subtracting itself, bit by bit, from the entire regime of significa- tion available to us" (Nancy 5). Therefore history, politics, philosophy, art, world, are not the names of subsistent realities in themselves but the names of concepts or ideas, entirely determined within a regime of sense that "is coming full circle and completing itself before our (thereby blinded) eyes" (4). We are traversing the end of the world of sense as we have known it. Predictably, this impasse affects, or should affect, academic disciplines.' In our case, it is the institution of literature that finds itself framed by the disappear- ance of "world" and shadowed, at present, by an alternative force that makes inoperative the literary. In what follows, I want to stay within the bounds of the crisis of literature by exploring a text that withdraws from the economy of mean- 1 Wallerstein adds that the crisis of the capitalist world economy carries with it the end of our institutionalized disciplinary ways of knowing, and of contesting, the changing world system in which we live.

Hillis Miller, Bill Readings, andJohn Beverley.</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /224 ing and patiently produces absence. In Tununa Mercado's En estado de memoria (1990), the experience of exile during the years of two military dictatorships in Argentina is the literal absence of ground. This thematic concern, however, is exceeded by a practice of writing that suspends the willful sutures of the now disappearing regime of sense as it brings representation to crisis. In this way, it transforms literature into an unstable performance whose true protagonist is language and whose negative force suggests that the story of an experience of the self can no longer be told. As such, Mercado's book is an autobiography that has mutated into icriture and here will be an enabling pre-text to meditate on how the institution of literature questions itself in "the age of transition." En estado de memoria creates a "world" from which signification is, to a large extent, leached before our eyes. This happens on one slope of its literary space, a slope where writing eludes redemptive sublations and exscribes life.2 But this is not, for the most part, how it has been read. On the contrary, several interpreta- tions treat its language as if it served the expressive functions of communication. Jean Franco, for example, describes it as a "deeply philosophical not to say ethi- cal work that examines subtle states of consciousness in a way that is unusual in Latin American literature" (253). She avers that it is a difficult text to classify, but she nevertheless stabilizes it, calling it both a memoir and a novel, and highlights in it the suffering of a consciousness unprotected from the horrors of everyday life (254). Basing her commentary on narrative as representation, and on the unexamined notion of a consciousness as individuality, Franco is able to tell us what this text means, what it is about-not an easy thing to do in the case of En estado de memoria and therefore a welcome starting point. This positive interpre- tation, however, forecloses the text's intense questioning of representation-which is probably what the word text actually means. As a supplement to studies such as Franco's, in what follows I will concentrate exclusively on that other slope of the literary space, which is made up of furtive and dense moments when the referen- tial function of language falters and mimesis is unworked. I will therefore be interested in those textual events that remind us that icriture cannot be summa- rized, that in it we do not know who speaks, and that we cannot read it. We can only write it.3 As we begin to read, we expect litigation against an intolerable state of affairs: the deaths and disappearances carried out by the Argentine Armed Forces dur- ing their sinister state of terror from 1976 to 1983.4 And there is, of course, quite 2 I use the term slope following Maurice Blanchot's descriptions of the paradoxes of the literary space, descriptions elegantly summarized and analyzed by Rodolphe Gasch&amp;.Jameson identifies the "other" slope that interests me here as the "non-Euclidean language" of high- and late-modernism (Singular Modernity 147), a language that Jameson distinguishes from the minimalist elements of realism in some of the texts he discusses. SReadings such as Franco's focus on whatJulia Kristeva would call the symbolic or phenotext of En estado de memoria. The phenotext denotes language that serves to communicate, "which linguistics describes in terms of 'competence' and 'performance'" (Kristeva 87). It presupposes a subject of enunciation and an addressee. Kristeva differentiates this from the genotext, which is a process or a practice that she links to the circulation of pre-symbolic drives and that produces structures that are ephemeral and non-signifying-the non-Euclidean second slope, in other words. 4 Mercado was away from Argentina twice: in France, from 1967 to 1980, immediately after the military takeover by Gen. Ongania in 1966; and in Mexico, from 1974 to 1987, during the cata- strophic period of the Per6ns's presidency and the subsequent reign of terror. En estado de memoria refers mostly to the second period.</page><page sequence="3">READING AN ABSENT SENSE/225 a bit of that, both explicit and implicit. Idelber Avelar, for example, considers this book to be part of the literature of postdicatorship mourning. I discern, how- ever, other elements that diverge from this historical frame, interpolations of a diverse regime of phrases that, for lack of a more precise word, we can call po- etry or irony, provided that poetry and irony are understood as interruptions of mimesis and the stability of genres as social pacts.5 The first sentence of En estado de memoria alerts us to such lines of flight. The book opens with the remembrance on the part of the narrator of someone called Cindal, who pleads unsuccessfully to be admitted for psychiatric consultation while the protagonist and others are in the doctor's waiting room, and who later hangs himself that evening: "The name of Cindal, whose spelling I ignore, re- turns time and again accompanying a man and a phrase of that man ceaselessly repeated in the waiting room of a psychiatric office. .. ." Something like a topic seems to emerge, perhaps the unfortunate role of psychiatry as portrayed through- out this first chapter. But the passing remark about spelling, which is extraneous to the plot and confuses the pathos of the scene, disturbs this thematic concern. A few lines further on, musing with bitterness on Cindal's subsequent suicide, the narrator thinks that Cindal, "whose name comes to my mind with regularity always accentuated on the letter i,... was allowed to die because his demand could not be met" (8).6 This time it is the spoken accent that disrupts realism. The insistence on breaking the mimetic pact in these particular ways, neither of which is germane to the storyline in any way whatsoever, draws attention to the figure of paronomasia, characterized precisely by the mobility of spelling and accent. This rhetorical figure can transform the hermeneutic activity of interpre- tation into a random process of selection wherein we are forced to guess, not decode, the meaning of a trope. If we respond to the challenge, we can propose, for example, that Cindal is a paronomasia of Celan. Both Mercado and Paul Celan wrote after a historical catastrophe. Celan was in self-imposed psychiatric care (for which Cindal pleaded), and Celan committed suicide (like Cindal). Other parallelisms could be mentioned (and some will be below), but my point for now is that our reading of a story has been disrupted. The realistic depiction of a patient asking for help in some medical office in Buenos Aires recedes in favor of a different theme: the struggle between modern poetry and history, encrypted here in the potential allusion to the German-writing, Romanian-born, Jewish poet Paul Celan. With its "spelling" and "accent" ignored, its "demand," like Cindal's, unmet and allowed to die, such poetry does not litigate directly. It does not speak the language of the institution or the state. Its negativity, barely visible, thus facili- tates an overconfident reading that reduces "Cindal" to a flesh-and-blood an- thropomorphic character (the episode is usually read like this) by narcotizing the two mystifying phrases. If, however, we acknowledge the tension between the 5 My understanding of poetry as "interruption" is based on Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe's reading of Paul Celan's description of his art (see below). For irony as interruption see Paul de Man's "The Concept of Irony." A more general treatment of the topic can be found in Astradur Eysteinsson's study of Modernism (179-242). 6 Page numbers refer to the 1998 Argentine edition of this text. Translations are my own.</page><page sequence="4">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /226 literal and the rhetorical (which haunts the whole text), we then find that the disquiet produced by "useless" figures such as paronomasia becomes productive. It enables the deconstruction of the hierarchical opposition between hegemonic sense (realism) and subaltern non-sense (the interruption of poetry or irony), not by bringing the latter back to the fold of common sense, but by potentially making the literal and anthropomorphic another rhetorical trope. In that case, we can think of Cindal, but also of the narrator herself, as tropes. On this other slope of the literary, writing avoids imaginary representation or narcissistic iden- tification and disrupts what Roland Barthes had called the bad faith of the first- person narrative (Writer Sollers 46). From this point on, we suspect that we will no longer be writing about a story or a self, both pretexts, but about a practice. Since writing frays the edges of genealogy as identification, Paul Celan's name enters our reading only as an imperfectly connected desire, the result of a hesi- tant or even arbitrary divination. This undecidability of the word is the effect of a particularly destructuring rhetorical figure, implicit paronomasia, which is what we confront here. In it, the original word never appears in the text, but instead remains latent, its shape uncertain, exposing "every word in the text to the possi- bility of being an alteration of some lost paradigm, which stubbornly withdraws from rational or divinatory reconstruction" (Hamacher 234). In our text, "Cindal" is the first example of such words or syntagms presented as disfigurations of a doubtful or irrecoverable original. Paul Celan's perhaps most famous poem (also his first in print and his first under the pseudonym Celan) was "Todesfuge" ("Death Fugue"). Written in Ger- man in 1944 or 1945, it was first published in a Romanian translation in 1947, when Celan was in Bucharest. Its title in Romanian was "Tangoul Mortii," "Tango of Death," and this was also its original title in German. John Felstiner informs us that at the Janowska concentration camp not far from Czernowitz, where Celan grew up, Jewish fiddlers and accordionists were ordered to play a well-known tango with new lyrics-now called "Death Tango"-for use during marches, tor- tures, grave digging, and executions.7 The musical score of this "Death Tango" was based on Argentine Eduardo Bianco's pre-war European hit, which Bianco and his band had played in Paris in 1939, and, later that year, performed for Hitler and Goebbels. At Auschwitz the orchestra also played tangos, and in other camps the prisoners called any music played when a group was led to death a "tango" (Felstiner 28-30). Could Tununa Mercado have been thinking of this whole situation, or of the particular poem with its first title under erasure? Perhaps it is the concentration camp of Celan's poem and the detention and torture centers of Argentina, as well as the disappearances of people in her own country, that form a historical lineage and so link the two texts. We could continue posing questions such as these, but the truth is that we have no way of knowing how to answer them. Implicit paronomasia does not produce a paradigmatic order but an asymptote, as if it were not a symptom but a ravishing of the symbolic order. And it produces what might be called archive fever, by its resistance to confirming whether Cindal 7 For a photograph of camp prisoners playing this piece in 1942, see Felstiner 30; the reference to the recording of this tango is on 297n23.</page><page sequence="5">READING AN ABSENT SENSE/227 is a person, an anthropomorphic character, an allusion, or even the first in a potential explosion of implicit paronomasia strewn everywhere and thus intensi- fying in us the terror of the infinite. From the reader's point of view, Celan's name functions like Ferdinand de Saussure's hypogram or paragram: it is the name under the name.8 Like Saussure's disseminated words, this paronomasia also has, in the end, no strict empirical validation. Perhaps a firmer footing for the random encounter of these texts can be provided by Theodore Adorno's memorable question: Is poetry possible after Auschwitz? (Adorno 34). What kind of writing do we expect after a catastrophe? Perhaps it is the import of Adorno's question, and not primarily the "tango" or the connec- tion of death camps and torture centers, that mightjustify our reading in Cindal a paronomasia of Celan. From those enigmatic first interruptions of the story line, we could then assume as a hypothesis that, like Celan's poetry, En estado de memoria will also wrestle with the untimely role of poetry in times of distress. "Untimely" would mean here an interruption or a dislocation of coherence. To continue with Celan, an unverifiable allusion now taking center stage as an extra-diegetic guide in our reading, we learn that for him mimesis, "art," the "beautiful," and representation-in sum, the poetic-are forms of alienation where life is benumbed. They constitute an automatism that it is the difficult task of poetry to break (Lacoue-Labarthe 41-70). Consequently, "poetry" is for Celan an untimely interruption of the benumbing consistency of sense. In 1965, as he was undergoing self-imposed psychiatric care (what Cindal wanted), Celan told a friend: "I don't musicalize anymore, as at the time of the much-touted 'Todes- fuge,' which by now has been threshed over in many a textbook." And then added: 'As for my alleged encodings, I'd rather say: Polysemy without mask..." (Joris 21). This is a dream of writing: to leave behind the social domain of programmed mnemonics and to elude the law that requires us to return language to some form of stable referentiality. Mercado similarly allows polysemy, as in this particu- lar example of Cindal, to infiltrate her subject and to disturb our notions of emplotment and of self. But she retains their facade, unleashing an oscillation in which prose masks the eruption of poetry as hypogram. The initial disorientation produced by the contraction of narrative into the spectral voice of poetry does not end here, but is subsequently shattered in a shocking second-degree interruption. This occurs a few pages later, when the narrator distances herself from Cindal's "autoconmiseraci6n" (self-pity) and his speaking "a voz en cuello" (his shouting, or howling). Whether this refers to Cindal, who had committed suicide, and/or to one of the great poets of the twentieth century, the narrator's disturbing register of diction and emotion pro- duces an instant decathexis of our own relation with the text itself.9 The only 81 refer here to Ferdinand de Saussure's study of hypograms in Latin Saturninan poetry, carried out in the first decade of the twentieth century. In this lesser known work, Saussure thought he had found, disseminated across the words of a poem or prose work, the name or hypogram that consti- tuted the point of departure of literary composition (Words upon Words xi). He worked on this project between 1906 and 1909, but did not publish its results. The study was edited by Jean Starobinski and published in French, in 1971, with the title Les mots sous les mots, and in English, in 1979, as Words upon Words. " "As soon, however, as one begins to speak about what one reads, as soon as one compares what one has read with what one has requested or thought one requested, doesn't the reader, become commentator, inevitably turn into the persecutor of the work?" (Lyotard 114).</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /228 useful engagement with this idiolect is to test whether this surface individual manifestation of (bad) taste can be read as a symptom of a more widespread unease throughout the work. One is tempted to give stature to the gesture by considering it a violent expul- sion, the mark of the return of nonsublimated, nonsymbolized anality, sadistic and aggressive. This return suffuses language with paragrams and glossolalia, says Julia Kristeva (152). In that case, and reversing Kristeva's sequence of cause and effect, the initial "sense" of implicit paronomasia (a form of glossolalia), which had suggested that this book would have something in common with Celan's poetry, is now sundered by nonsublimated aggression. This severance is con- firmed by an explicit denegation of poetry when, paraphrasing but not identify- ing verses of Dylan Thomas, the narrator confides a secret: that the sap of the poem, "the force which through the green stem drove the flower, the same that drove my green age," is in reality a perfect inducer of ulcers and gastritis (9). It is the lyric that is here denied, unmasked as the temptation of false transcendence -a temptation whose strength would explain the equal and awkward strength of the rejection. If the real struggle in literature is that of genres, then it is prose here that severs itself from the lyrical longing for the Absolute and introduces poetry as the derailment of shared sense. Celan, for his part, gives us an alternative way to read such discord (Lacoue- Labarthe). In his Meridian Speech, he focuses on the nature of art as marionette, those "puppets" and their "wires" of which Georg Biichner writes in his play Danton's Death. The puppets' grand phrases on the way to the scaffold, their "tri- umphant pathos and proverbialism," are disoriented by Lucile's cry: "Long Live the King!" (Celan 402-403). Celan posits that Lucile's is not a reactionary procla- mation but is instead the interruption that derails the automatism of "-alas, Art!" As such, her cry is "poetry." An invisible difference is thus introduced that separates the political semantics of the exclamation from its formal function as dissonance. In similar fashion, I would perhaps valorize dissonance in Mercado's current example solely for the rupture of identification it performs. In general, in this and other instances, the repeated and unpredictable disturbances of co- herence in her text cut the puppet's wire and work against idealization. Thus, Mercado's writing enables us to consider questions, but provides no answers, as to what kind of writing we expect after a catastrophe. Perhaps the illusion of literature is rejected in her text because it would contaminate the memories of the dead-or perhaps because the theatrics of revolution would mask the soli- tude of revolution.10 Because we do not know, we have to countersign a docu- ment whose intention is cryptic. What we do know is that the story itself, even the empirical knowledge that we so much request from her text, is marked by apha- sia or reticence, while repeated interruptions populate its other, spectral slope. Writing entices us to counter-read. The discord introduced by the indifferent rejection of self-pity and howling dismembers the body of the writer and the poet, or the writer as poet. Cindal (Celan?) is left, when we last see him, genuflecting in a characteristic modernist 10 This solitude, although not thematized as such, can be read in the amazing work of reconstruc- tion of the times of revolution in Anguita and Caparr6s.</page><page sequence="7">READING AN ABSENT SENSE/229 pose of anti-hero. Ultimately, it is the body of Orpheus the poet (Paul Celan, Dylan Thomas) that is dismembered and whose ghost returns in a later scene in a London hotel as if to confirm the erasure of one literary form of traditional transcendence: the lyric, the poetic, the symbol-alas, Art. The preceding commentary, which appears to exceed the textual detail that prompted it, is what will now allow me to generalize. This writing takes a distance from any form of faux transcendence, presented as such either through its denegation or through its absence. The lyric-the lyric as the beautiful, as meta- phor and coherence-is denied here, in this chapter. Representation itself will be rejected in a later chapter, in which the thematic key is explicitly avoided, portrayed as the frequent "picklock" for the infinite doors of narrative (104). Politics, for its part, deprived of all specificity, becomes a marked absence, an empty mausoleum in the melancholy house of Trotsky. As it forestalls any and all transcendence, as it does not say what we want it to say, such writing produces an absent sense, as if sense and its absence were abyssal mutual feints. Contributing to this is the effect of a radical irony, manifested in the preceding example by implicit paronomasia, but equally strong and bewildering in other moments of textual catachresis when we cannot distinguish between reference and orphan- ing. "Whose spelling I ignore": Werner Hamacher reminds us, in his reading of Celan, that reference and orphaning are, in German, Verweisung (reference) and Verwaisung (orphaning), homophones distinguished only by a written vowel (252). This appeal to the materiality of the letter is similar to that in Mercado's textual moments when polysemy, overflowing the boundaries of theme or genre, challenges the comfort of the conventional fit of context with paratext and text. Orphaned words return writing and reading to an experience of limits-from the Latin ex-perieri, a crossing through danger (Lacoue-Labarthe 18). The scene of reading, a motif within so many literary works of the past, from Don Quijote to Madame Bovary, seems to happen here outside the text and profoundly qualifies the legitimacy of any interpretation." From that spectral slope, we can reduce the anecdotal (the memoir, the autobiography, the often flimsy phenotext) to a pretext of ex-perieri as danger. All this displaces the habitual reading for the plot, and moves us from the linear reading of the age of the book to a focus on the dehiscence within words themselves. On them this text allows work to take place, and thus will make us wonder, when we reach the last page, whether the narrator's return to Argentina means a restoration of the individual self. Irony, or poetry as interruption, introduces the scene of the other and therefore disrupts the dia- lectic of story as transformation of the same. The notion of the book is challenged here, the book understood as the condi- tion of possibility for meaning, totality, systematicity. All the moments of undoing in En estado de memoria point us towards a different place, a heterotopia closer to Blanchot's, for whom the book and its transcendental meaning are but a strategy for evading the radical absence at the heart of language and culture. The book is " Nora Catelli has lucidly studied scenes of reading in literary works of the last two centuries, tracing the constructive function of the representation of reading in the nineteenth century through the gradual exhaustion of its efficacy in the late twentieth century. She concludes her study by asking a question that we cannot yet answer: whether with material supports other than the book something akin to the experience of Literature will continue to exist.</page><page sequence="8">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /230 a ruse by which "writing goes towards the absence of the book"' (Blanchot, qtd. in Critchley 98). Mercado's memoir becomes a ruse when, with the change of ge- stalt from one slope to the other, the signified disappears and the signifier be- comes a perplexingly opaque material thing. This opacity brings out the desire in the substance of language, producing an anasemic erotics that designifies sym- bolic exchange. This is not at all the ludic function of literature, but rather a practice of writing that produces "the distress of the infinite," whose consequences Blanchot ex- plained as follows: If to write is to surrender to the interminable, the writer who consents to sustain writing's essence loses the power to say "I." And so he loses the power to make others say "I.". .. The notion of charac- ters, the traditional form of the novel, is only one of the compromises by which the writer, drawn out of himself by literature in search of its essence, tries to salvage his relations with the world and himself. (27, my emphasis) En estado de memoria engages, or engages us, with the interminable, one of whose modes of manifestation is precisely that neither Cindal nor, later on, Ovidio Gondi, nor, later still, Andr6s, the homeless writer or his doubles in the square, nor, ultimately, the narrator herself, function as anything more than those compro- mises of which Blanchot speaks, wisps of characters whose reality is shadowed and erased by the possibility of being other. Ovidio Gondi, for example, may well have been a real person in the author's life and thus has a place in her supposed memoir. Having been forced to flee to Mexico during the Spanish Civil War, and now working as an editor, he does not want to return to Spain or to renew any affect with his past. The narrator decides to go in his stead to his hometown in Asturias. Her mission, she says, wavers between restitution and melancholy (54). All this is plausible enough and may be true in an empirical sense. However, when the train that takes the narrator from Madrid to Oviedo ascends through the clouds, the scene begins to acquire the derealized outline and motionless time of a dreamscape. As Gondi had warned, "You have to go through the clouds ... All that is unreal" (53). Upon arriving at the "doors of heaven" (54), she encounters an old man who had been a friend of Gondi. While he performs "Celtic rituals," this proverbial old man, like a Prop- pian function, shares with the narrator, or recites, a list of reverent and spare recollections. In the midst of them, one of his sentences completes the estrange- ment effect: "Here Ovidio read to me a poem about boats" (55). As if bewitched, on the other side of the clouds and of the real, the name Ovidio resonates with that of its namesake, the author of the Metamorphoses, Publius Ovidius Naso, whose name in Spanish is Ovidio and who we know wrote poems-unlike Gondi, about whom all we know is that he is an editor. This other Ovidio was banished from Rome in AD 8 by the emperor Augustus and died in exile in AD 17. Both Gondi and Ovid, both Ovidio and Ovidio, belong to the large family of those who spend the end of their days away from their motherland. The narrator could be one of them. Before proceeding with the uncertainty introduced by the name Ovidio, we should expressly note that its effect, once recognized or hallucinated (a product of the strong stylization of the prose), is to transform the realistic scene of an autobiography into an ironic history of art. As she is getting ready to leave the</page><page sequence="9">READING AN ABSENT SENSE/231 Spanish town, the narrator casts her gaze on old retirees sitting in the sun and doing nothing in the paralyzing heat, retirees among whom Gondi would now find himself had he returned to Spain. It was better for him that he had not come back, she concludes. If we now reread this entire scene as a trajectory that moves from a mythic territory at the doors of heaven to the final unadorned calculation about productivity and/or retirement from history (the retirees in the square)-in other words, if we give the word mythic its full literal weight- then Ovid[io] reading his "poem about boats" is a blinking cursor in the center, the name under the name that stands for literature and that appears halfway between myth and productivity-or between societies banded around their name and their foundational stories and societies like ours based on the speedy ex- change of profitable information (Lyotard 181). The scene thus becomes an ironic description of the place of literary studies today, or a compressed history of literature. If "Ovidio" and his "poem about boats" are indeed an opening of language to the other, two elements need analysis. The first is the prosody of the old man's recitation, organized like a stylized list or catalogue around the repetition of the deictic "here" and whose rhythm we might now be anxious to compare (not quite successfully, of course) with distant narratives in which Ovid took a part: distant narratives of the war of Troy, revisited perhaps as a blurry and mythic antecedent of the fall of the Spanish Republic and the translation of empire from the left to the right. For example, here is Virgil's Aeneas narrating to Dido how the Trojans return to the beach to read the traces there of the Greek army: They take pleasure in going out and looking at the Greek camp, the deserted places and abandoned shore: this was where the Thessalians used to pitch their tents, and there the cruel Achilles. This was the place for their fleet, and here they used to fight in battle. (Aeneid 2.27-30, qtd. in Barchiesi 197). Ovid reworks this scene in his Heroides, where Penelope writes to Ulysses narrat- ing how the Greek heroes re-evoke for their wives the fall of Troy: When the tables had been set someone would give a show of the fierce battles, painting the whole of Troy with a few drops of wine. "This is where the Simois flowed; this is the land of Sigeum; this was where old Priam's lofty palace stood. This was where Achilles pitched his tent, and there Ulysses; this was where the mangled Hector terrified the horses into bolting. (Heroides 1.31-36, qtd. in Barchiesi 198) The allusion to Virgil in Ovid's text makes it impossible to decide "whether this is a trace of the Trojan war or of Virgil's text about that war." The sequence of deictics points the reader of Ovid both towards an absent reality being imagined (the war of Troy) and towards an absent model text (Virgil's) (Barchiesi 198). Unlike these classic examples, however, the deictics in Mercado's writing point, if they point toward anything, toward an absent tradition that has become unrec- ognizable. Yet the prosody also imperceptibly contributes to the overall sense of estrangement and conjures the apparition of a ghost. The deictic "here" is charged with unhomely overtones, since it is precisely when we no longer know what "here" refers to that we enter the uncanny. Older models of authority and grounding, once conveyed by allusion and in- tertextuality, begin to approach mere noise-in Willy Thayer's words, intertex- tual material now reduced to "amputated members of an unknown language"</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /232 (281). Thayer's conclusion-that it is impossible to assimilate such noise in the "box of resonance" of writing-becomes still clearer if we focus on a second ele- ment: names rather than prosody. We recall that the title of one of the two collec- tions of letters Ovid wrote in his unhappy exile was Epistulae ex Ponto. Ponto, in Ovid's title, is the ablative of the name given to the Black Sea province of the Roman Empire: Pontus, from pontus, i.e., sea. His are thus Letters from the Black Sea. That is his "poem." But ponto as a nominative means boat.12 Thus, "the poem about boats" substitutes, if that is what is going on, Ovid's ablative for a nominative and again intensifies the play with homophones (Ovidio/Ovidio, Ponto/ponto). The effect of this (mis) recognition is to cut short our initial an- ticipation of making sense. Reading in the name "Ovidio" an allusion to the pain- ful condition of banishment would have confirmed that we know what we are doing: we are reading about poets in exile, with Ovid's lamentations as the au- thoritative model, whether sincere or not.13 But the confusion between homo- phones (Ponto is not ponto) transforms reference into orphaning. Paradoxically, this orphaning is not a cancellation but an intensification of the spectrality chal- lenging monolingualism. It is a second-degree interruption: first the transcen- dent meaning of Ovid(io) and poem suspends the story itself and transvaluates the anecdote into Art, and then the pun interrupts the interruption, its absur- dity cutting short the harmonious domain or faux transcendence of "-alas, Art!" Hermeneutic expectations fade, if they are not outright aborted, when the semic dilation of the traditional allusion turns out to be a different issue alto- gether: that of an origin here discovered to be the translation of a "wrong" gram- matical case. The mimesis of exile in its literality is thus disowned. It is undone by the effect of parabasis, or what Friedrich Schlegel also called the "buffo" (de Man 178), both of which shatter our confidence that we know what we do when we read. Here, this occurs when what appeared to be a metaphor, a figure of similarity (I am like Ovid!), turns out to be a pun. The poetics of the pun is also a politics that attacks our notions of language as transparency. Understood as the particularity of the homophones to a given lan- guage (none of this would have occurred in the English translation, where Ovid is not Ovidio: in English there is no ghost), both paronomasia and the pun can be connected literally to the "mother tongue" and its absent word,14 or meta- phorically (as here) to a "mother" literature whose absent names, reduced to 12 I thank my colleague Nancy Shumate for her help here. 13 "Ovid's undoubted rhetorical gifts have caused him to be dubbed insincere and even heartless, and he seems indeed to have lacked the capacity for strong emotion or religious feeling. Judged, however, by his gift for fantasy, Ovid is one of the great poets of all time." "Ovid." Encyclopedia Britannica. Mercado's text could be dubbed "insincere" unless we concede that self-reflexive irony is, pre- cisely, a meditation on writerly "sincerity." Ovid's art has interesting parallels with Mercado's that should be further explored. Specifically, the Ars amatoria was Ovid's first masterpiece, while Mer- cado's Canon de alcoba, which is a strange ars amatoria, was her first important book. Ovid's Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto, both written in and about exile, describing his miseries and appealing for clemency, would then correspond to Mercado's En estado de memoria. 14 This is what Lacanian psychoanalysis calls lalangue. "This register is nothing other than that which absolutely distinguishes one language from every other one: a singular mode of making puns ... By that it [lalangue, the mother tongue] also makes itself substance, possible matter for fantasms, inconsistent ensemble of places for desire" (Jean-Claude Milner, qtd. in Ulmer 178).</page><page sequence="11">READING AN ABSENT SENSE/233 hypograms, release the work of semiosis from within the confines of institutional form (i.e., genres, plot, anthropomorphism or linguistics) and disseminate it into writing. As lexical selection loses motivation and legitimacy, as the buffo's impertinence destroys narrative coherence, the pun produces an an-esthetic ef- fect that dislocates representation and sends reading back to the broader and urgent interrogation of art itself. Mercado's writing is no longer literature, whose residue, however, it carries like a secret difference within the same. Noise is all that is left of old literature since the time when Hegel pronounced it dead: "art is henceforth for us a thing of the past."15 This dramatic statement could be replaced by the following: "[Lit- erature] is on a continuum with those forces by which it has habitually proclaimed itself to be menaced," the networks of power-serving knowledge (Bersani 198). Or, today, it could also be rephrased as the question of whether, without the material support of the book, any future experience of Literature will still exist (Catelli 198). Writing knows this. It is not only Mercado's friends and so many others that have died in Argentina, nor is it only Revolution, with all its faults, that is dead: it is also the institutional form that could once represent them. Writing, therefore destitute, puts literature under erasure, as it illegally engages in a dangerous consorting with literature's ghosts, only to disavow them. This is writing's second slope. As in anamorphosis, focusing on moments of writing intensity makes invisible the life of the plot, while doing the opposite, reading for the plot, requires the suppression of what will then amount to illeg- ible blotches or disturbing noise. They are the blotches whose spelling and ac- cent we ignore, or the noise of unnerving paronomasia and unexpected puns. Unlike the anamorphic skull in Holbein's "The Ambassadors," these hypograms or paragrams are here potentially inscribed anywhere: there is no guaranteed angle of visual perspective or any privileged acoustic site from which to detect and regularize the unknown spelling or the noise of polysemy. The interruption (the buffo, parabasis) is thus an event, its unpredictability and potential ubiquity homologous to history's state of emergency. The formal model of a coherent story is interrupted by the absurd, noise, poly- semy, the buffo, the hypogram, parabasis. It is interesting that an entire epoch of modern art has necessitated such a variety of terms to convey the interruption of the mechanical aspects of meaning, and I have allowed Mercado's text to con- jure them in order to contextualize her writing within the broad archive of mod- ern reading, catastrophe, and the unworking of sense. In concrete terms, and purely for the purpose of illustration, the pattern is applicable to recent U.S. history, in which "9/11" functions as the shock that disorients the "story" of American exceptionalism, the buffo whose spelling and accent the boilerplate of such a history ignored. The event is initially perceived as an enigmatic phrase that, like Mercado's, is not anticipated by the plot. It produces terror, as does reading paragrams (as Saussure knew). Interpellated by that interruption, all the differ- ent genres of discourse-political, speculative, historical, religious, military- will go into high gear and rush to link the "noise" of the heterogeneous phrase to their own stories. They will hasten to regularize its spelling and name it once 15 Qtd. in Nancy 130.

But the interruption, in writing and in history, has a virus-like quality and silently keeps proliferating. The syntax of this writing, therefore-the form or even the template, and not the content-is what represents history; the ground of sense is now reduced to a mere anecdote overwhelmed by the interruption of the event. The repeated identification and its immediate shattering represent history as it is lived by many in the interregnum and as it was lived in other places, such as Argentina, for a very long time. This is an appropriate point to attempt to anchor this vague periodization in the "autobiography" itself, beyond the well-known history of the Argentine Armed Forces organization of murder, torture, and disappearances that sent the narrator into exile in Mexico and that was, after all, not an auton- omous happening. We could do so by focusing on a specific scene in London's Hyde Park, when the narrator confuses the flag of Iran with the Mexican flag and runs towards the group of people surrounding it. She runs home, she thinks. The discovery that the flag is not Mexican and that she does not understand the language of the people surrounding it is a humorous moment of shock for a displaced and very dejected Argen-Mex.'6 In passing, the narrator mentions that terrorists have taken over the Iranian embassy-thus the presence of Iranian onlookers in the London park. This could be a reference to a real event in 1980, a minimalist moment of otherness within the awe-inspiring recent Iranian revo- lution."7 The confusion of the flags then could be read, at the symbolic level, as a marker of periodization: the Cold War is the period when the flags of Mexico and of Iran, by which I mean the flags of any two Third World countries, could be "confused" to the extent that installing a Shah in one place or supporting a military junta in another responded to the same political and economic logic; the Iranian Revolution, the background to this particular scene in the text, ini- tiates the change in the world of sense that will be complete ten years later when the Soviet Union collapses (and when this "book" is published) and the world Left goes into disarray. It is the arc of time that extends, for my purposes, from the violent anticolonialism encapsulated in Che Guevera's call to create two, three, many Vietnams, an anticolonialism which was subsequently utterly destroyed (in Argentina, in this case) and whose shards reach us today transformed into some- thing like a delinking from Occidentalism and a struggling for economic coun- terglobalization. Or terror. En estado de memoria, written at the midpoint of this broad metamorphosis and remembering Guevara as one of the dead, is in a state of suspended animation, with a woman in the center uselessly running home to an equivocal flag and shivering in the wrong "clothes" (more on this below). Therefore, this model is in more than one way unlike Holbein's anamorpho- sis, which is grounded in a transcendent pre-modern view of meaning as the 16 Argen-Mex is the nickname given by Mexican writer Paco Ignacio Taibo II to the many Argentine exiles or refugees in Mexico during the times of state terror in Argentina. Things have changed in Argentina in ways that are too many to enumerate here, but I want to add that the thirtieth anniver- sary of the coup, in March 2006, was repudiated in massive protests in Argentina and was, for the first time, also observed in Mexico in official recognition of that country's solidarity with the refu- gees.

In Mercado's writing, the flit- tering change of gestalt does not come to rest on sense either as premodern transcendence or as modern political signification, but creates instead a parody of our (hi) story in which the shock of interruption and the disappearance of ground seem to be no longer the exception but the rule. This is parody under- stood not as comic or complacent, but as the moment of "a vertiginous non- mastery"'8 on the part of the traditional author and of the reader, of a generalized anxiety brought about by potentially ubiquitous idiolects before they are nor- malized. The anxiety of idiolect, in Jean-Francois Lyotard's words, is also the marvel of the encounter with the other and a mode of the threat of Ereignis. It is the nothingness of a "what-is-to-be-linked" (143)-the nothingness, for example, of the phrase "here Ovidio read to me a poem about boats," a phrase whose resonance disrupts the story and whose exegesis overpowers the plot. Or, for example, the nothingness (within the grand scheme of things) of an explosion in a building, different from explosions in other buildings, and whose compa- rable and equally infinite exegesis has led to wars and horror and has overpow- ered the predictable story of the self. The undoing of literature as representation is confirmed when the narrator, ready to return home after her initial exile in France and her work as a professor, tears up and incinerates all her class notes for the teaching of Latin American literature. This burning of the notes, however autobiographical it may have been, functions, in my view, as a mise an abyme of the text's own constant undoing. What is incinerated is the institutionalization of literature, reminding us through this gesture of the "institutionality of this institution, but of an institution that can only consist in passing itself off as natural" (Derrida, Given Time 1 169). We can read the narrator's action as the burning of the institution or of her false naturalization. Or of both. In either case, we are dealing with identity papers here. And it is this condition of having no institutional legitimacy that writing assumes at the limit of or beyond literature. It looks like literature, but it is noth- ing. It looks like prose, but it demands that we read parts of it word for word, and even letter for letter-in other words, as poetry. Therefore, what Mercado's read- ers treat as an autobiography, a testimonial novel, an example of the criolla gen- der essayl9-all of them social pacts that frame and control interpretation, as well as examples of the storyteller's art, and all, ultimately, books-has a signifi- cant second slope that constitutes a writing. It is a critique of genres that burns the institutional identity papers as it ungrounds literature and returns it to a state of emergency. This is the way in which writing accompanies history. 18 See Derrida: "To use parody or the simulacrum as a weapon in the service of truth or castration would be in fact to reconstitute religion..,. in the interest of a priesthood of parody interpreters. No, somewhere parody always supposes a naivety withdrawing into an unconscious, a vertiginous non-mastery. Parody supposes a loss of consciousness, for were it to be absolutely calculated, it would become a confession or a law table" (Derrida, Spurs. Nietzsche's Styles [1978], qtd. in Rose 191). 19 En estado de memoria has been read as a novel (Franco), as fragmented memoirs and a testimo- nial novel (Avelar), as a novel, autobiographical fiction, and personal testimony (O'Connell), and as an example of the subgenre of the "criolla gender essay" (Castillo 106-107). Other readings thematize exile within the genre of autobiography.</page><page sequence="14">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /236 The function of the institution of (modern) literary history, writes Michel de Certeau, is tirelessly to restore referentiality: "In this fashion, it transforms the text into an institution, if we define the institution as the instrument which ren- ders credible the adequation of discourse and reality" (32). And literary history could not by itself have enough power to produce this credibility. All institutions must work together, each supporting the other in a network which constitutes the web of belief. But of course it is that "web of belief" that is in tatters today.20 Unrestrained by themes and story, free from characters or psychology, writing stops being a communicative function as it dodges the management of cultural mnemonics (Cohen 224). Unlike mimetic genres, writing works its way towards the impossible dream of an ungraded supply of phrases from all regimens, and linkages from all genres-towards a "multitude" that preserves the incommensu- rability of genres and does not neutralize their differend (Lyotard 158). Celan, Thomas, Ovid (and we could mention other names), the tragic, the gothic, the autobiographic and the comic, the buffo and the radical irony that undoes the allegory of tropes, the perplexing anacoluthon-in their mutual interruptions and their differend, all come together as a multitude that shares, within the gen- eral intellect of our times, the outside of a dying regime of sense with other disorganized and evanescent real multitudes-of piqueteros, neozapatistas, dalits, sans papiers, landless peasants, and a host of unaffiliated social and antisystemic movements that would begin to rise soon after this text was published. They all maintain a critical distance from the ideology of institutional representation, whether it is political parties or Literature. Writing seems to accompany the mul- titude-not the people, nor the instituted representatives of the Hobbesian people as one. Writing and the "multitude" trying to regain their bearings in Argentina in 1990 accompanied each other barely knowing each other, on opposite sides of a then wounded state: writing insinuates the waning of modern literature as the institution of the (national or universal) bourgeoisie while the multitude sug- gests the emergence of the desire of new forms of representation (Mignolo, Santos). Writing is a residual moment of negative reading at the time when memory studies, ethnic studies, and cultural studies emerge to transform and pluralize the archive and supplant or decrease the institutional space of literary studies. As such, it has the attraction of ruins, which call upon us to reconstruct a lost world. The initial living memory of Mercado's supposed memoir does not lead to anamnesis. Instead, it seems to slide invisibly into hypomnesis, understood as repetition of the signifier, memory as memory of the other. Mercado refers to some of these questions in her essays on writing. For example, she confirms the effect of uncertainty about the "I" and its objects when she acknowledges that her writing involves the appropriation of the text of another (Martinez-Richter 20). Her writing is a process, Mercado's explanation begins, that occurs while dreaming about the reading and writing of another. But this description is im- mediately and imperceptibly transformed into what is not quite the same: "Seguir 20 For a sampling of analyses of our current situation, see Slavok Zizek, particularly his argument with the U.S. academy, and-for Argentina in the late 1990s-Ricardo Forster and the interviews in Javier Trimboli.</page><page sequence="15">READING AN ABSENT SENSE/237 escribiendo en suefios el libro que se ha estado leyendo" ("To continue writing in our dream the book that we have been reading"). This anacoluthon that changes dreaming of someone's writing to writing it ourselves in our dreams, is then expanded as a secret process of "vampirism," a "theft," says Mercado, not of another writer's theme, or anecdote, or topic, but of the "soul" of the text of another ("... un robo... del alma de un texto ajeno" [Martinez-Richter 20]). This process, with its unresolved tension between desire and aggression, is not unidirectional, however, and is not without consequences. The self and the life are themselves vampirized by the barely discernible agon of souls in which it is impossible to distinguish who is the subject and who the object of dreaming. The result is that ghostly phrases of desterrados of the single language, and also, per- haps, the specious syntax or even the counterfeit money of the secret of litera- ture, inhabit this text and preserve it against the interpellation of the institution, which demands signification and exchange value. Such writing is evanescent. In it, the materiality of language and the antino- mies of text interrupt the referential and unwork the automatism of sense. And yet we keep looking for meaning and permanence through, not in, its words. This is particularly so in the case of prose, in which, more than in poetry, "writ- ing, sensible matter, artificial exteriority [is viewed as] a clothing" (Derrida, Of Grammatology 35). Perhaps it is not unrelated that the narrator lives in clothes, she tells us, inherited from others. Again, I repeat myself: however autobiograph- ical this detail of the clothes may be, for telepathic readers the word has another, alternative meaning: clothes, material writing, the letter that distinguishes refer- ence from orphaning. Saussure concluded that the effect of writing on truth is "wrong (vicieuse) " and is "really pathological" (qtd. in Derrida, Of Grammatology 38). If we agreed with Saussure, the Saussure who abandoned as hopeless the study of hypograms, we would be predisposed to interpret the last paragraphs of Mercado's text as a happy healing, the predictable homecoming to the fold of sense and to a putative common ground of representation. We would be tempted to be done with writing. Indeed, the last chapter has been reassuringly read as reconnecting representation and the polis (Avelar, Moreiras) and completing a process of mourning. While reasonable, such an interpretation appears to be a willed return to older forms of story as dialectical transformation, a return which consigns ecriture to the domain of Saussurean pathology--or "delirium" in the words of Alberto Moreiras. It is possible that in the (U.S.) academy, redemptive endings are a sine-qua-non for the genre of pedagogy as bildung. Or, more gen- erally, there may be a profound and irreducible antinomy between modern prac- tice (text, criture) and teaching, as Barthes suspected (The Rustle of Language 27, 28). The arrest of permanent parabasis by historicism could be understood, then, as a negotiation with the social production of the web of belief. On its other anamorphic "slope," however, En estado de memoria can be read as a practice that explores, in the pregnant year of 1990, enunciation and memory as alterity within the proper, a story that has no beginning and no end (Giordano). Unlike Antigone, or unlike the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo, whose struggles it does not emulate, such a practice of writing does not directly defend an alternative law. Politically, it is in search of its rule, caught between the museum of Trotsky</page><page sequence="16">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/238 and the homeless mad Peronista in the square, in suspended animation when the country's return to formal democracy coincided with the world's time per- ceived either as the positive end of history or as the negative "closure of every dem- ocratic emancipatory project."21 A narrative that is no longer narrative, by being extreme, forces us to decide. We cannot read writing: as Barthes taught us, we can only write it. And in doing so, bereft of paradigms, we can either bear witness to the eruption of the other by attempting to explain the idiolect or we can forget differends by "advocating a given genre.., .for the sake of political hegemony" (Lyotard 142, 181). I have chosen to avoid the return to an older epistemo-critical model (the author, sig- nification, presence), because doing so is, in the end, of indifferent value within the broader context of writing. I have chosen instead to investigate a few poten- tial idiolects that can then serve as a starting point for a meditation on literature and in which the representation or the story of the individual-which is our story-is stealthily and repeatedly upstaged by the buffo and terror. That is an alternative form of realism. Willfully destitute (assuming that anything here can be labeled willful), writing's relation to literature reminds us, apres coup, that a whole cast of writers of literature and writers of theory, for which this reading of a text acts as a possessed medium, constitutes a colectivo that is gradually becom- ing uncanny. At the level of metacommentary, and not of the self or of the socially sanc- tioned ego, the blockage of allusion that the interruptions ultimately perform is a symbol of the bracketing of that literary filiation once understood as redemp- tive authority or as epistemic ground. It has now become incalculable and un- verifiable. In this way, writing returns us to the dream of the radical undoing of literature as system, as if it were only in its own self-negation that literature's intelligence could live-on today.

This gradual allowing of the voices of others-i.e., the voice of Homo sacer-to be heard, ignores, says Zizek, the fact that the democratic public space is a mask: ultimately, in today's post-politics, "we are all Homo sacer" (100).</page><page sequence="17">READING AN ABSENT SENSE/239 Barchiesi, Alessandro.
