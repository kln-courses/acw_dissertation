London: Institute of Germanic Studies, London University, 1972. The object of this essay is not, we are told, to claim that Goethe was the author of unique and original scientific theories, but rather to show that his "wayward but in- triguing" views were the product of tradi- tions which were still flourishing in his day, and to indicate that his originality did not lie in any specific ideas, which were soon super- seded anyway, but in his use of science in a comprehensive theory of life. Goethe is thus presented to us not as a scientist but as a philosopher of nature. His science is then presented as a matter of selection, rejection, and new synthesis from a number of tradi- tions or paradigms which were available at the end of the eighteenth century. The three traditions which Nisbet dis- cusses are Neoplatonism, Empiricism, and Rationalism. He is cautious about discover- ing "influences" on Goethe from particular scientists or philosophers, but he does bring out the importance of Herder, and through him of Charles Bonnet and of Bacon. The difficulty about picking various traditions against which to look at Goethe or anybody else is that even ordinary people do not perfectly exemplify any tradition. But as a schema it seems to work here in that it makes Goethe's science intelligible. Goethe, like many of his contemporaries, disliked "systems" but clung firmly to various general views. Under Neoplatonism, Nisbet brings out Goethe's belief in the Leibnizian Great Chain of Being and the associated conviction of the harmony and unity of nature and of its intelligibility to the human mind. Everywhere Goethe saw analogies, some of which seem to us far- fetched and anthropomorphic-which to Goethe was attractive. Beneath the variety of forms and phenomena Goethe sought for archetypes or Urphanomene in which a quality was revealed in a striking fashion. Under Empiricism, we see Goethe as an experimenter, working in the Baconian manner from observation to observation rather than in the hypothetico-deductive style of Descartes or Newton. He believed that one must not isolate phenomena and thus lose the vision of unity; nor must one abstract, for this is to oversimplify. The Urphainomene at which one must aim are then genuine phenomena, but they have an ideal quality for they strikingly display some quality. Goethe's Baconianism is thus, like Cole- ridge's, Platonic rather than technological. Polarity was a striking feature of the Urphdnornene, and Goethe was ready to see everywhere opposing elements coming to- gether to form a whole-as were many contemporary chemists. Goethe's science was thus descriptive rather than mathematical or causal, and</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 65 * 2 * 227 (1974) 287 under Rationalism we find described his rooted opposition to applied mathematics and to causal explanations, both of which seemed oversimplifications in which a few elements in a situation were artificially isolated and in which phenomena were for- gotten in a neoscholastic infatuation with formulae. Since nature is a web of relation- ships, crude teleology must go as well as causality. It is valuable for the historian of science to know about those like Goethe who took a keen interest in science without making major contributions to science as now taught. For it helps us to see the wood for the trees and to see how science was regarded, and what was regarded as science, in the past, which is after all the chief task of the historian of science. Nisbet's essay, like Petry's notes to his trans- lation of Hegel's Philosophy of Nature, shows us a keen intellect trying to impose order on the science of his day and to bring it into relationship with other human interests and activities. Goethe is particularly interesting in that he was by conviction an amateur, very conscious of the price to be paid for speciali- zation and professionalization. Nisbet's at- tractive and well-written essay shows the value, to the historian if no longer to the scientist, of a comprehensive vision-if like Goethe he can avoid losing himself in abstraction.
