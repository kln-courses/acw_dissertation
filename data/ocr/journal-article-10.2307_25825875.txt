<plain_text><page sequence="1">43 THE EXCHANGE Deja Vu DAVID L. BERQUAM Some recent queries in "The Ex change" had been frustrating reference workers everywhere before their appear ance here. A good example is the search for the origin of the "ghosties and ghoulies" prayer (RQ 16, No. 3, Spring 1977). The prayer is included in a number of collections and is commonly assigned a Scottish origin. Octave S. Stevens, Dis trict of Columbia Public Library, and Paula Gannaway, Lubbock (Texas) Chris tian College Library, located this version (titled "An Old Cornish Litany") in G L. Adshead's An Inheritance of Poetry (p.365): From Ghoulies and Ghosties, And long-leggity Beasties, And all Things that go bump in the Night, Good Lord deliver us. Other versions of the poem appear in E. H. Sechrist's Poems for Red Letter Days ("Litany for Halloween"), W. H. Cole's Poems for Seasons and Celebrations ("Old Spell"), the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations ("Cornish"), and The Scots Book (''Invocation") by R. M. Douglas. Evelyn Greenwald, Southern California Answering Network, Los Angeles, points out that the "ghosties and ghoulies" ques tion has appeared several times in Notes and Queries. According to an entry in the December 1955 issue (vol. 200, p.547), On each occasion a Scottish origin has been suggested, although no definite proof has Tricky questions, notes on unusual in formation sources, general comments con cerning reference problems and their so lutions are wanted for "The Exchange."

There seems no justifica tion for associating it with Cornwall, even though it has appeared there on picture post cards and souvenirs for a great many years. In another note from the same issue (p.548), A. Francis Steuart writes, tlI think I found it in an old paper in the Cor tachy Charter Chest in Angus." SCAN librarians who worked on this problem add, "We don't know what the Cortachy Charter Chest is, but it sounds impress ive." Indeed it does! "Exchange" readers successfully de termined the nature and purpose of the "Gleaners," but it may be impossible to identify the particular group described in RQ (16, No. 3, Spring 1977). Paula M. Strain, the Mitre Corporation, McLean, Virginia, writes, . . . familiarity with a number of similar pic tures in family albums dating from the period 1900-20 suggests to me that this is likely to be a picture of a Sunday School class, with the inset portrait of an older woman being the picture of the teacher. In rural areas at that time, Sunday School was a much more social activity than it is at present, and the classes held special exercises and programs, had group pictures taken, and gave themselves names. 'The Gleaners" was a not uncommon name; it appears in the identification of two different church groups in my family album?one in West Virginia, one in Kansas. I'm afraid that this sort of reference ques tion is forever unanswerable without some clues from the original owner of the photo graph. When photographs aren't labeled, there is very little that can be done to re trieve information lost when the memories of those concerned are no longer available to consult. Dorothy Jacob, Idaho State University Li brary, Pocatello, also remembers "Sunday</page><page sequence="2">44 FALL 1977 RQ School classes for young (and not-so young) ladies, in the 1920-30 period, called 'The Gleaners/" According to Mary Glenn Hearne, Nashville (Tennessee) Pub lic Library, a class with that name still flourishes in a local United Methodist Church. Finally, several readers pointed out that the "Gleaners" was the organiza tion for young ladies in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. EASY RIDERS From Colorado State University at Fort Collins, Betty L. Hacker writes, "One of our patrons remembers seeing a picture and accompanying text describing 'hitch hiking hummingbirds' in a magazine pub lished during the period 1945-65. He believes the magazine to be National Ge ographic, but a search of its cumulative indi ces as well as Reader's Guide for those years was unsuccessful. The source is thought to be a popular periodical, not a scientific journal, and the patron further believes the text de scribed hummingbirds hitch-hiking on Canada geese. The scientific name for this occurrence is phoresy, a non-parasitic relationship in which one species is carried about by another. I hope we can find some help in verifying our patron's memory. 'The Exchange' is our last resort." BACK TO SCHOOL Part of a poem submitted by Jean O. Smith, Buhl-Henderson Community Li brary, Sharon, Pennsylvania, has been tentatively identified by "Exchange" readers. The first four lines of Smith's puzzler (RQ 16, No. 3, Spring 1977) re semble the third stanza of "Tell Me Why," a song associated with the campus tradition of dormitory and sorority "candlelightings." Here is the song as it appears in D. and B. Best's Song Fest (p.131). Tell me why the stars do shine, Tell me why the ivy twines, Tell me why the skies are blue, And I will tell you just why I love you. Because God made the stars to shine, Because God made the ivy twine, Because God made the sky so blue, Because God made you, that's why I love you. I really think that God above Created you for me to love; He picked you out from all the rest, Because He knew, dear, Td love you the best. Mary Jane Kayes, Madison, Wisconsin, comments, "The song was sung while a candle was passed around a circle of women (who did not know to whom the candle belonged) until it was blown out by the owner, thereby announcing her recent engagement. Usually, the engagement ring was attached to the candle in some way, for all to admire." WHO'S WHO "The question we would like some help with is one we have had several times in this area," writes Evelyn Greenwald, di rector of SCAN. This is a list of famous persons or celebrities dead and living who were adopted. We have come up with the following list so far: Gerald R. Ford, Arthur Linkletter, Gen. James Ga vin, Edward Albee, James Wainwright (ac tor), and James Gordon MacArthur (actor and adopted son of Helen Hayes). Three his torical figures, who were not formally adopted, but might be said to have "taken" adoptive fathers were Edgar Allan Poe, Henry M. Stanley, and Alexander Hamilton. The authors Goertzel and Goertzel in their 1962 study, Cradles of Eminence, of charac teristics of prominent persons had this com ment (p.221): "The lack of foundlings or adopted babies among the Four Hundred [their list of prominent persons who were studied] raises a question as to the reason for the absence of unusual achievement among children who never knew who their parents were." Emma F. Andy, Morrisson-Reeves Li brary, Richmond, Indiana, has a patron who is curious about the identity of Zoe Cass. The only information any of us can find is that this name masks the identity of a well known author. I have searched Contempor ary Authors, Current Biography, Biography Index, two volumes of pseudonyms, and Reader's Guide. Indiana State Library has checked the Ohio College Library Center and the New York Times Data Bank. TEATIME "Exchange" readers located more than half a dozen sources with information about the origin of the teabag (RQ 16, No.</page><page sequence="3">FALL 1977 RQ 45 3, Spring 1977). Among these The Book of Firsts by P. Robertson is unique in credit ing this innovation to Joseph Krieger of San Francisco. Other sources name Thomas Sullivan of New York as the in ventor of the teabag but disagree about its date of introduction. According to The Tea Cookbook by W. I. Kaufman and Tea by J. Shalleck, the teabag first appeared on the market in 1908. An earlier date, 1904, appears in The Book of Coffee and Tea by Joel, David, and Karl Schapira and The Enriched, Fortified, Concentrated [etc.] Foodbook by J. Trager. Sullivan's motive for introducing the teabag appears to have been entirely commercial. Shalleck's Tea (p. 117) states: The tea bag originated in the stingy impulse of Thomas Sullivan . . . who . . . sent out tea samples in little silk bags instead of the larger tins. Strangely enough, he received orders for the silk bags, not for the tea they contained. Whether Sherlock Holmes could have visited New York when teabags were popular remains a mystery. Marjorie Pet ers, Wheaton (Illinois) Public Library, ex amined a copy of The Annotated Sherlock Holmes (vol. 1, p.65) and concluded that "Holmes was in retirement and keeping bees on Sussex Downs ... a few years before the first appearance of the teabag." But Ruth Kelly, Rosenberg Library, Gal veston, Texas, notes that: According to Michael Harrison's The World of Sherlock Holmes, Mr. Holmes was born on January 6, 1854, and was more or less ac tively involved in criminology until his last case in 1914. The actuality of a historical anachronism depends upon when he visited New York. Is there a Baker Street Irregular in the house? MORE NEW QUERIES Milbourne O. Wilson, Dallas, Texas, thinks we may need a new word in the language. We have the word anthropomorphism: the at tribution of human motivation, characteris tics, or behavior to inanimate objects, ani mals, or natural phenomena. Shouldn't we have a word which attributes animal charac teristics to inanimate objects? As an example, take the cavorting, snorting, bucking, kicking, etc., of a car in an animated cartoon, the ex pression of anger in its headlights, or its race-horse stance at the starting line. There may be a word for all of this and other simulated behavior, but I am not famil iar with it. Patricia Stevens of Atlanta, Georgia, has a quotation she hopes readers can identify. She warns that it may not be remembered very accurately. And so I [offer?] Melpomene this modest mead of praise And crown my aging graying locks with Del phic oric lays. Finally, Jean C. Montgomery, librarian for Bridgewater (New Jersey) Raritan High School East, hopes someone will recognize the author and source of the fol lowing paraphrases.
