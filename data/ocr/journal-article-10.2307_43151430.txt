<plain_text><page sequence="1">DIMENSIONS OF THE SHEKHINAH: THE MEANING OF THE SHIUR QOMAH IN JEWISH MYSTICISM, LITURGY, AND RABBINIC THOUGHT* Marvin A. Sweeney Academy for Jewish Religion California Claremont Lincoln University and Claremont School of Theology The article discusses a Jewish mystical text that paradoxically takes up the measurements of the body of G-d in the context of a tradition that forbids corporeal, finite, or tangible depiction of the Deity. Consequently, scholars have been at a loss concerning its interpretation. Many resort to invective, labeling the work "a monstrosity" or "a malignant growth on the body of Judaism." But others note its metaphorical or midrashic character, insofar as it appears to draw out the meaning of biblical texts that project a sense of G-d's corporeal presence, and its gargantuan physical dimensions for the body of G-d that are beyond normal human comprehension. Three major aspects of the Shiur Qomah are considered: its relation to biblical texts that appear to de- scribe G-d in physical terms; the incomprehensibility of the measurements given; and its liturgical character, with the descriptions of G-d's body inter- spersed among elements of prayer and benediction that point to some form of heavenly worship. The paper concludes that the liturgical dimension is key: the readers are confronted with G-d's unimaginable size in the context of a heavenly but recognizably Jewish service and thereby prompted to consider before whom they pray. 1. Introduction The Shiur Qomah (nQlp HiPttJ, "The Measure of the Body [of G-d],") is one of the most problematic, controversial, and misunderstood writings in the entire Jewish tradition.1 The Shiur Qomah is known primarily for its dis- cussion of the measurements of the body of G-d. For example, Shiur Qomah section B states: from the place of the seat of His [G-d's] glory and up is [a distance of) 1,180,000,000 parasangs. From His glorious seat and down is 1,180,000,000 parasangs. His height is 2,300,000,000 parasangs. From the right arm until the left arm is 770,000,000 parasangs. And from the right eyeball until the left * This paper is a revised form of a public lecture presented at the Academy for Jewish Religion California, June 13, 2010.

The skull of his head is 3,000,003 and a third parasangs. The crown of his head is 600,000 parasangs corresponding to the 600,000 Israelite minions. Thus, He is called the great, mighty, and awe- some G-d.2 A parasang is an ancient Persian measurement, equivalent to about three- quarters of a mile.3 The concluding statement, "Thus He is called the great, mighty, and awesome G-d," justifies the immense measurements given for G-d's body. The Shiur Qomah grows out of the merkabah mystical tradition of the late talmudic period.4 It is an attempt to elaborate upon the experience of the priest and prophet Ezekiel, whose vision of G-d in Ezekiel 1-3 stands as the foundation for the Jewish mystical tradition. Particularly important in this respect is Ezek 1:26, which describes the presence of G-d in anthropo- morphic terms, namely, "and above the expanse over their heads was the semblance of a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and on top, upon this semblance of a throne, there was the semblance of a human form." The Bible prohibits the representation of G-d in human or any other tangible form. And interpreters should note that as a priest of the holy Jerusalem Temple, Ezekiel is careful throughout the vision to use the language of simile to avoid any statement that G-d can be so portrayed.5 Nevertheless, the Shiur Qomah does portray G-d in human terms, and its interest in the measurements of the body of G-d therefore raises serious theological ques- 2 See M.

He argues that anyone who would conceive of G-d in such a corporeal man- ner should be considered a heretic, an Epicurean, in a category with animals, and as having brains filled with the lunacies of old women." Abraham ibn Ezra on the other hand, quoting R. Ishmael, maintains that, "anyone who knows the measurement of the creator is certain to have a share in the world to come" (commentary to Exod 33:2 1).12 Modern scholars have not always been enthusiastic about the work, but research points to the importance of the Shiur Qomah in the development of Jewish mysticism. Heinrich Graetz (1817-1891) viewed the Shiur Qomah as part of his overall understanding of mysticism and Kabbalah as "malignant 6 But see B. D.

He claimed that the work was a monstros- ity that was smuggled into Judaism during the ninth century by Jews who sought to imitate the work of Muslim sectarian mystics concerned with the dimensions of G-d's body.13 Elijah Benamozegh (1822-1900) argued that the Shiur Qomah was an authentically rabbinic forerunner of Kabbalistic thought that employed bodily description as part of a larger attempt to con- vey the true character of G-d's glory.14 Philipp Bloch (1841-1923) regarded the Shiur Qomah as a text designed to teach Jewish children something of the majesty and greatness of G-d and of mathematical computations.15 Adolf Jellinek (1820-1893) recognized the antiquity of the Shiur Qomah from Rabbinic times and argued that it is a midrashic elaboration on the portrayal of the bridegroom in Canticles 5. In Jellinek's view, the dimensions of the body of G-d are so great as to be beyond human comprehension.16 Moses Gastor (1856-1939) held that the Shiur Qomah was written in Jewish Gnostic circles interested in filling the gap left by Gnostic literature by providing a full description of G-d. 7 Gershom Scholem (1897-1982) main- tained that Jellinek's link between the Shiur Qomah and Canticles 5 was weak and argued instead that it is a second century elaboration on Ps 147:5 composed as part of a larger Merkavah Rabbah text.18 Saul Lieberman (1898-1983) agreed that the Shiur Qomah was an early Tannaitic exposition of Canticles 5, adding that the text portrays G-d as a youthful warrior at the Red Sea or at Mt. Sinai.19 Ithamar Gruenwald offers little that is new apart from his observation that the text is intended for public recitation. Accord- ing to Martin Cohen, the Shiur Qomah is an early work that influenced Sefer Yetzirah and laid the foundations for the Kabbalistic notion that the divine 13 H.

Vita Daphna Arbel demonstrates that the portrayal of the body of G-d in the Shiur Qomah grows out of Mesopotamian mythology concerning Marduk and other Mesopotamian gods.23 Peter Schäfer holds that the con- cern with the dimensions of the body of G-d derives from portrayals of the angels in Merkavah literature, such as Metatron, who states in 3 Enoch, "I was enlarged and increased in size according to the measurement (nyiy) of the world in length and breadth."24 Several important factors grow out of this research, namely, 1) the in- terest in the Shiur Qomah in midrashic elaboration on earlier biblical texts concerned with the portrayal of G-d; 2) the incomprehensibility of the measurements given; 3) the mythological portrayal of G-d as the creator and primary power of the universe; 4) and the role of the Shiur Qomah in public recitation. I would like to build on this research by noting the liturgical ele- ments of the work and arguing that the Shiur Qomah is fundamentally a li- turgical text intended for public recitation. The various depictions of the measurements of G-d's body are interspersed among liturgical texts that, when read together, construct a heavenly liturgy based upon the standard Jewish prayer service. The incomprehensibility of the divine measurements observed by Jellinek is deliberate. 5 Such a technique is intended to impress the audience of the Shiur Qomah with the majesty of the divine presence. By placing the divine measurements in the midst of a heavenly liturgy, the Shiur Qomah prompts those engaged in Jewish worship to attempt to imagine themselves before the incomprehensible grandeur and glory of G-d. In order to demonstrate this hypothesis, the present paper first examines the inter- relationships between the Shiur Qomah and the biblical texts noted above, that is, Ezek 1 :26, Canticles 5, and Ps 147:5. It then turns to the construction of the prayer service that provides the basic structure of the Shiur Qomah' s presentation of the divine measurements. 21 M. S.

The Midrashic Character of the Shiur Qomah Although Judaism forbids the physical portrayal of G-d as idolatrous, the Bible is filled with statements that suggest a physical character for G-d. In Gen 1 :26, G-d proposes, "Let us make humankind in our image." Numbers 12:8 quotes the deity as saying, "with him [Moses] I speak face to face, and he beholds the form of YHWH." According to Isa 33:17, "Your eyes will see the king in his beauty." According to Ezekiel 1 :26, the prophet saw "a throne in appearance like sapphire and seated above the likeness of the throne was something that seemed like a human form." Psalm 147:5 main- tains, "Great is YHWH and abundant in power, His understanding is above measure." And Cant 7:8 states, "This is your body like a palm tree and your breasts are like its clusters." All of these texts are understood in one form or another as references to the portrayal of G-d, and exegetes have struggled throughout the history of Jewish interpretation to ensure that they are not read as expressions of idolatry. Indeed, Hos 12:1 1 provides a key criterion for reading such passages as metaphors: "I spoke to the prophets; it was I who multiplied visions, and through the prophets I speak in similes/ silence."26 The ark of the covenant would have served as a tangible symbol for the presence of G-d in the holy of holies of the First Temple. Thus, the Bible's references to YHWH, who is enthroned above the cherubs, are attempts to portray the divine presence in relation to the cherubs associated with the ark and the temple's inner sanctum (e.g., Isaiah 6; Ezekiel 1). But the absence of the ark in the Second Temple would have prompted mythological specula- tion concerning the portrayal of the divine presence, both during the Second Temple period itself and in the centuries following the temple's destruction. Thus, Daniel 7 portrays G-d as one "ancient of days" with a garment like white snow and hair like lamb's wool. G-d's throne is described through the imagery of fire streaming forth before G-d and the myriads of attendants. Hekhalot Rabbati dispenses with portrayals of G-d altogether and focuses instead on the seven levels of heaven through which the mystic traveler must pass and the many angels who must be acknowledged on the journey to the throne of G-d. We have already noted Ezekiel's portrayal of G-d in Ezek 1 :26, but let us consider the full text in Ezek 1:26-27: 26 For discussion of Hos 12:11, see M. A. Sweeney, The Twelve Prophets (BO; Collegeville: Liturgical Press, 2000), 1:125.</page><page sequence="7">Hebrew Studies 54 (20 1 3) 113 Sweeney: The Shekhinah And above the firmament which was above their head, like the appearance of a stone of sapphire, was the likeness of a throne, and above the likeness of the throne was a likeness like the appearance of a human being upon from above. And I saw like a sight of hashmal, like the appearance of fire encasing it round about, a vision of His loins and above and a vision of His loins and below. I saw what was like a vision of fire, and it was shining all about. As a Zadokite priest, Ezekiel is fully aware of the prohibition against the physical portrayal of G-d - here in human form - and interpreters have already observed the book's extensive use of the language of simile to avoid a direct statement that G-d takes any tangible form. Readers may further note the use of the imagery of fire, and earlier wind and water, to portray G-d because these elements are tangible, but they function admirably as metaphors insofar as they have no inherent delimitation to their forms. Rabbinic literature recognizes the problem here and includes Ezekiel 1 among the texts that may be expounded only by a sage who knows his own knowledge {m. Hag. 2:1). In discussing this statement, the tractate's Gemara makes it clear that such physical portrayals of G-d are acceptable but they must be properly interpreted and expounded because of the knowledge of G-d that they convey. For instance, the Gemara cites the case of a young boy with exceptional ability who understood the meaning of hashmal (Vniyn, probably a precious or semi-precious stone) in Ezek 1 :27 and began to ex- pound upon it. A fire immediately consumed him because he had not yet reached a fitting age to engage in such interpretation.27 Likewise, the Gemara recounts the famous legend of the four who attempted to enter 0TI2 (orchard; here understood as an appearance before the throne of G-d). Of the four who made the attempt, only Rabbi Akiba was successful, because he possessed the knowledge and qualities that the other three lacked. Thus, the Gemara maintains that one must approach such texts carefully, and it holds out the example of Rabbi Akiba, arguably the greatest sage of Jewish tradi- tion, as an example of the person it takes to expound upon such texts properly.28 Interpreters may consider the Song of Songs, an example of ancient love poetry in which a woman anticipates union with her lover, generally in very explicit sexual terms. Rabbinic tradition regards the Song of Songs as an 27 For discussion of this passage, see M. A.

In- deed, m. Y ad. 3:5 indicates an ancient debate as to whether the Song of Songs should be included in the Bible. Rabbi Akiba ultimately rules in favor of the book, declaring it to be the holy of holies of the sacred Scripture that was revealed to Moses at Mt. Sinai so that the book is now read as part of the liturgy for Passover. Canticles 5:10-16, which has played an important role in the discussion concerning the Shiur Qomah , is an example of the wasf genre, a poetic form employed in ancient Egyptian love poetry to provide explicit descriptions of the body of the male or female lover.29 In this case, the lover is male: My beloved is clear skinned and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand. His head is finest gold, his locks are curled and black as a raven. His eyes are like doves by watercourses, bathed in milk, sitting by a brimming pool. His cheeks are like beds of spices, enhanced by perfumes. His lips are like lilies, dripping flowing myrrh. His hands are rods of gold, filled with beryl; His belly a tablet of ivory, decorated with sapphires. His legs are like marble pillars set in sockets of fine gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as the cedars. His mouth is sweet and all of him is delightful. This is my beloved, and this is my darling, O daughters of Jerusalem. The imagery is clearly erotic, and when applied to an understanding of the presence of G-d, describes G-d metaphorically in profoundly human terms. Of course, we do not know that the male lover must represent G-d and the female lover Israel. And so the portrayal of the female lover in Cant 7:2-10 might also describe G-d: How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O daughter of nobles! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master's hand. Your navel is like a round goblet - mixed wine shall not be lacking! Your belly like a heap of wheat entwined with lilies. Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle. Your neck is like a tower of ivory, your eyes, pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bath-Rabbim, Your nose is like the Lebanon tower that looks toward Damascus. Your head upon you is like crimson wool, the locks of your head are like purple - A king is held captive in the tresses. 29 See R. Murphy, Song of Songs (Hermeneia; Minneapolis: Fortress, 1990), pp. 169, 171-172.</page><page sequence="9">Hebrew Studies 54 (201 3) 115 Sweeney: The Shekhinah How beautiful you are, how lovely! Love with all its rapture! This, your body is like a palm, your breasts are like clusters. I say, I will climb the palm, I will take hold of its branches; May your breasts be like clusters of grapes, may your breath be like the fragrance of apples, And your mouth like fine wine. Let it flow to my beloved as new wine, gliding over the lips of sleepers. Here we may especially note verse 8, "This, your body is like the palm, your breasts are like clusters," particularly because the Hebrew word "jriDlp (your body) is employed in reference to the female lover. It is, of course, the same term that appears in the title of the Shiur Qomah. The following proposal to climb the palm and take hold of its branches could be understood then as an act of adherence to G-d, and the portrayal of the woman in the Song of Songs could be easily read as a metaphorical portrayal of G-d. As mentioned above, Scholem also cites Ps 147:5 as a biblical reference clearly related to the Shiur Qomah : rD"in ttjvto Vnj (great/big is our L-rd, and mighty of strength).30 This verse also describes G-d in tangible terms, this time those of size and strength. But the significance of this verse is tied to its gematria associations. Interpreters have observed that the Hebrew phrase ro'rm (and mighty of strength) has a numerical equivalence of 236, that is, waw = 6, resh = 200, beth = 2, kaph = 20, and heth = 8. Cohen argues that this number is significant for the Shiur Qomah because it provides the basis for the assertions in section B that the height of G-d is 2,300,000,000 parasangs and that of G-d' s crown, 600,000 parasangs. Reflection on a verse from the Psalm that portrays G-d in sexual terms, like the Song of Songs, forms the basis for calculating at least some of the basic measurements for G-d' s body employed in the Shiur Qomah. In sum, the above examples indicate that the Shiur Qomah represents midrashic reflection on biblical passages concerned with tangible portrayals of G-d. Some of them, such as Ezek 1 :26-27, Song of Songs, and Ps 147:5, provide the basis for the text's interest in the measurements of G-d' s body. 3. The Liturgical Character of the Shiur Qomah The next stage of our discussion is a consideration of the liturgical character of the Shiur Qomah. Hints of such a character are already evident insofar as some view the Shiur Qomah as a text that calls for reflection on 30 G. Scholem, On the Mystical Shape , pp. 23-24.</page><page sequence="10">Hebrew Studies 54 (201 3) 1 1 6 Sweeney: The Shekhinah the presence of G-d and that is designed for public recitation. But an over- view of the text further demonstrates that it includes all of the basic elements of a Jewish prayer service, albeit modified to portray a heavenly liturgy. Section A of the Shiur Qomah begins with the superscription, nnipn nao rumo Tjy (The book of the body, topics concerning the chariot).31 Immediately following, the Shiur Qomah begins with a very familiar prayer that initially corresponds to the opening paragraph of the Amidah, nnK ļim -man bnjin bxn npy tòni pn^ tòn dîton tòn utiun tòni urÒN " pòy mum (Blessed are you, O L-rd, our G-d, G-d of Abraham, G-d of Isaac, G-d of Jacob, the great, mighty, and awesome G-d, G-d Most High), But then the text diverges from the standard form of the Amidah, D'OU? rmp D'odori ļbo Nin nriN pNl (Creator of heavens and earth, You are king, king of kings), in place of the expected San rmpi D'aio OHon bau (the one who keeps fidelity and who creates everything). Indeed, as the Shiur Qomah's version of the opening paragraph of the Amidah continues, it focuses on the divine throne and the fiery presence of G-d upon it, "And your seat on the throne of glory and the celestial creatures ascend to the throne of glory. You are fire, and your throne is fire, and your celestial creatures and servants are fire."32 Readers will recognize that the version of the opening paragraph of the Amidah presented in the Shiur Qomah is influenced by biblical texts that associate G-d with flames, namely, Ezekiel's depiction of a flaming presence of G-d in Ezek 1 :26-27, Isaiah's portrayal of the seraphs as flaming angels around G-d in Isaiah 6, and Daniel's description of a stream of fire breaking out from below the throne on which G-d sits in Daniel 7. The emphasis on fire thus suggests a heavenly vision of G-d, leaving little doubt that the liturgy accompanying it is a heavenly one, analogous to the earthly liturgy that Jews perform as part of the standard worship service on earth. Turning to section B, readers see a concern not with liturgy but with the dimensions of the body of G-d.33 Rabbi Akiba is the speaker in this section, and he reports what Metatron, the angel of the presence of G-d, has revealed to him. The statement, partially quoted in the beginning of the present arti- cle, is followed by a series of unpronounceable names concluded by the familiar benediction from the Shema, dVijò ìniuVo ms Diy ļmi Nin Tm 31 M.

Here, readers see an interest in relating the dimensions of the divine body to a key statement from Amidah concerning G-d's size and other qualities as well as to a statement from the Shema concerning G-d's eternal royal glory. But they must also consider the concrete numbers cited here. As observed above, these numbers are derived in part from the numerical equivalencies of the statement concerning G-d's stature in Ps 147:5, that is, the 2,300,000,000 parasangs of G-d's height are derived from the numerical equivalent 236 of the phrase ro'in (and mighty of strength) in Ps 147:5. The number 230 is accounted for in the height of G-d, and the remaining number 6 is then related to the 600,000 who witnessed G-d's revelation of Torah at Mt. Sinai in Exodus 19 (see Num 2:32). The opening statement of section C reads, "And all who know this secret are certain to acquire the world to come."34 Following references to G-d's protection of the righteous, the text appears to presuppose the Kaddish that marks the conclusion of the Amidah in the standard Jewish prayer service. But of course it deviates from the standard form, bbrb D'ITI uruN "p'a1? tik ļVn -im ļbn Vra ļbn Vraròi to'? onròi raw1? (and therefore we are obligated to praise, beautify, glorify, and to exalt, to bless, and to magnify the great king, the mighty king, the strong king). The passage goes on to heap praise upon G-d for all of G-d's actions on behalf of creation and Israel, much as the standard form of the Kaddish does in the Jewish prayer service. To be sure, G-d's qualities are here magnified beyond those of the standard Kaddish, but that reflects the role that this Kaddish plays in a heavenly liturgy. And readers may note that in section Cx, an alternative paragraph identified by Cohen for this portion of the Shiur Qomah, a new and embellished version of the prayer Mi Kamokha (11QD 1Q; Who is like you?) appears: "Who is like our L-rd? Who is like our G-d? Who is like our King? Who is like our Savior? There is none like our G-d. There is none like our L-rd. There is none like our King. There is none like our Savior." Again, the embellishments of this version point to a heavenly liturgy. Turning to section D, readers encounter an initial quotation from Rabbi Ishmael.35 He is well known as the sage who established the thirteen princi- ples of exegesis as well as the figure that plays a key role in the narration of the Hekhalot Rabbati, a Merkavah text that relates an attempt to ascend 34 M.

Here Rabbi Ishmael makes a statement that is remarkably akin to the Kedushah section of the Amidah: "I saw the king of kings of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, as He was sitting on an exalted throne and His soldiers were standing before Him to the right and to the left." This statement then intro- duces another section concerned with the bodily measurements of G-d. Rabbi Ishmael recounts how Metatron spoke to him and how he asked Metatron about the measurements of the body of G-d. He reproduces Metatron's lengthy account of the size and holy names of each of G-d's body parts, including the feet, the soles of the feet, the calves, the thighs, the loins, the heart, the neck, the head, the mouth, the beard, the face, the cheeks, the forehead, the eyes, the arms, the shoulders, the palms of the hands, the fingers, and so forth. Upon concluding this description, section D once again quotes the familiar statement from the Amidah, "Therefore is He called the great, mighty, and awesome G-d." Again, the measurements of the body of G-d are placed in liturgical context. Following a large number of sections concerned with descriptions of the holy and awesome presence of G-d, section M then comes forward with another familiar statement from Jewish liturgy akin to the Aleinu prayer re- cited near the conclusion of the Jewish service.36 Section M reads, biD 'pi1?« nwan Via ihn -prvVi -priarôi iVuVi "pu1?! -pN3t7 Trau?"? innxm iiwnn DTin ti rwajn bo 'piVn ninwjn (We are obligated to praise you, to beautify you, and to bless you, and to magnify you, and to crown you, and to declare your unity, O L-rd of all beings, G-d of all souls, G-d of all life, the Life of Lives, the First and the Last). Again, the modified form of a standard liturgical prayer points to a worship service in the heavenly realm, beyond our normal experience. It is followed by the concluding section of the Shiur Qomah, section N, which calls upon the readers to fall on their faces before G-d who resides in heaven, and continues with a detailed por- 37 trayal of the heavenly temple and all of its retinue at a time of worship. Cohen's alternative Section Nx concludes with statements that the worship- pers are to go out into the world to do acts of Torah following their encounter with the divine. This survey of the Shiur Qomah points to a very significant feature of this text: it intersperses the portrayals of G-d's presence and the measure- 36 M. S.

As observed above, the modified nature of these prayers and benedictions points to a heavenly liturgy in which the worshippers perform the major sections of the Jewish worship service before G-d, whose bodily measurements are provided among the major segments of the liturgy. 4. Conclusions This paper must now ask, what does the preceding discussion demonstrate? First, readers must note that the Shiur Qomah is based in reflection on scriptural texts that portray G-d in tangible terms or that suggest such a por- trayal. Ezekiel 1, the Song of Songs, Psalm 147, and other pieces noted above indicate that, like many other Near Eastern cultures, ancient Jews em- ployed physical bodily imagery to portray the presence of G-d. Readers must also recognize that such portrayal is considered metaphorical, as indicated in Hos 12:1 1 and elsewhere. Indeed, the names that the Shiur Qomah gives to the body parts of G-d are apparently intended to express divine qualities, although it is not always clear what they are. Insofar as the tangible portrayal of G-d is intended to provide a foundation for reflection on the divine character, the Shiur Qomah takes up such portrayal as a means to engage in such reflection Second, readers must recognize the numerical component of such a por- trayal. Gematria appears to play a role in the Shiur Qomah'' s reflection on the body of G-d. This discussion has noted that Ps 147:5 yields the number 236 when read through the lens of gematria and that this number is instru- mental in calculating major dimensions of the divine body in the Shiur Qomah. Other numerical dimensions may be similarly derived although in- terpreters have yet to identify all of them. But there is another dimension to the numerology, apart from the recognition of the numerical equivalents themselves, and this is the gargantuan dimensions employed in the Shiur Qomah. It maintains that G-d's height is 2,300,000,000 parasangs. Although that is a calculable number, it is a figure beyond normal human comprehen- sion, one that would make God comparable in size with our solar system. Such a feature is an indispensable aspect of the Shiur Qomah' s depiction of G-d: the divine presence is massive, but it is also beyond human capacity to</page><page sequence="14">Hebrew Studies 54 (20 13) 120 Sweeney: The Shekhinah grasp in a meaningful way. The point of such numbers is not to limit the divine presence; it is to demonstrate its overwhelming character. Third, the Shiur Qomah has a liturgical dimension insofar as it is com- posed and structured around the major elements of the Jewish prayer service. It includes versions of the Amidah (including the Kedushah), the Shema, the Kaddish, the Mi Kamoka, and the Aleinu, with the depictions of the divine body interspersed among these liturgical elements. Such a strategy is quite deliberate insofar as the Shiur Qomah intends to place its readers in the context of worship of G-d's divine presence. But in doing so, it reformulates the Jewish liturgical pieces so that the prayer service could be identified as a heavenly one. In the context of the Merkavah or Hekhalot literature, such a strategy is hardly surprising as this literature constantly employs liturgical dimensions in its portrayals of the divine and human attempts to relate to G-d. But here readers must recognize that the liturgical structure is founda- tional, that is, liturgy sets the structure of the text, with the depiction of the body of G-d intended to be read within the context of that structure, not vice versa. When this fundamental feature of the Shiur Qomah is recognized, readers must conclude that the text employs the bodily dimensions of G-d as a means to address its readers, asking them to imagine the overwhelming presence of G-d before them as they pray. In sum then, the Shiur Qomah is not an embarrassment or a monstrosity as some past scholars have argued; it is an attempt to reflect on the presence of G-d in the context of Jewish worship. By portraying the tangible and im- mense presence of G-d in the context of Jewish prayer, the Shiur Qomah emerges as a text that asks its readers to remember before whom they pray and to reflect upon the deity before whom they live throughout their lives in the world of creation in which G-d has placed them.</page></plain_text>
