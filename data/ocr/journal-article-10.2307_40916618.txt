<plain_text><page sequence="1">6 A Late Minoan IB town shrine at Palaikastro Jan Driessen This Chapter explores the spatial context of the Kouros in more detail and argues for the identification of its architectural context in Building 5 as a shrine,1 exam- ining the possible function of this shrine, a question closely related to the function of the statue. Some ad- ditional thoughts are devoted to the original location of the statue. THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE SHRINE Construction in the central zone of the town at Roussolakkos, Area 6, came to a halt before the Minoan eruption of Thera in the LM I A period and resumed in LM II.2 This struck us as odd, at the time of excava- tion, especially since the LM IB habitation period at Roussolakkos is characterised by over-crowded build- ing plots and, as pointed out in Chapter 2, part of the open area surrounded by Buildings 1, 3, 4 and 5, called the Plateia, was encroached upon by the occupants of Building 1 . Area 6, which measured at least 47.0 x 3 1 .0 m, was abandoned, left open, and enclosed by a stout wall; the only function of the area in the LM IB period, contemporary with the Palaikastro Kouros, was for drawing water from two wells, which had been dug at this time. It has been suggested that this area served to concentrate livestock within the urban confines after the troubles caused by the Santorini eruption (Trou- bled Island, 82-3, 233). This may be so, but there may be more to it. The wells in Area 6 were gradually given up and filled in during the LM H-IIIA/B periods, partly with rubbish from surrounding destruction lev- els. Hence, Well 605, in the NE corner of the area, con- tained, amongst other objects, a fine but broken ser- pentine rhyton fragment depicting dolphins.3 At least part of this rhyton was covered in another material, possibly gold, as suggested by the prepared lower sur- face. From the other well, 576, several fragments of large, weathered ammouda horns of consecration were recovered, and at least three pairs of slightly different dimensions could be reconstructed (PK igç4/ç6, 261, fig. 19). There can be little doubt that all of these ob- jects belong to the ritual equipment of a Neopalatial structure. One of the possibilities, suggested in the pre- liminary report (PKigg4/g6, 261-2), is that these items derived from the fine mansion in the SE part of Area 6. Since this building was dismantled before the Santorini eruption, whereas these items came from LM HIA-B levels in the wells, it is perhaps more likely that another source should be sought. We have mentioned above, in Chapters 1 and 2, how Rooms 1 and 2 of Building 5 were reoccupied during the LM II-IHA period. One hypothesis then is that the rhyton and sacred horns originally came from Building 5. This is suggested by the possible ritual connotations of the architectural modifications. Indeed, considering the facts that: i. The Plateia was closed off and aggrandized, in- volving actions of exclusion and concentration. Earlier entrances to Buildings 3 and 4 were blocked, ii . The NW part of Building 5 was given ashlar façades with masons' marks, which are the first to be dis- covered at Palaikastro. In this regard, the symbolic value of ashlar must be stressed: it signposts power and ritual and it must have been immediately clear to a Minoan that something special was to be ex- pected behind these walls.4 Moreover, it can be shown that masons' marks, and especially double axes, have specific ritual connotations, enhanced by their repetition (Hood 1987, 205-11). iii. The doorways of Rooms 1 and 2 were given an axial alignment and are both very wide. This operation therefore was intended to direct and concentrate traffic and attention but also allow participation, iv. Room 1 was given a fine paved floor pointed with red stucco and bright wall frescoes. Again, public display seems to be intended. The paving seems to have acted as a 'red carpet', sign-posting something to be expected in the next room. v. The NW part of Building 5 was closed off from the rest of the building, which was accessible via a sepa- rate entrance. This act of separation should be seen in connection with the ashlar refurbishing of the NW rooms. 1 For methodology, see especially J. W. Wright 1994; 1995; Fernandez 1988 and Marinatos 1993. 2 As shown by a wall with associated deposit, including a ritual double vase, found during the 1996 season (PK igç4/ç6y 242- 4)- 3 PK igç4/çò, 226, fig. 13. Cf. another rhyton fragment found during the early explorations 'in a trial east of town', which surprisingly still retained part of its gold foil covering and showed a charging boar (PKU 136-7, fig. 118). 4 On the symbolic aspect of ashlar, see Driessen 1995, 71-2.</page><page sequence="2">88 JANDRIESSEN vi. A pit, a special receptacle, covered by slabs, was placed centrally near the door of Room 2. These features imply a specially constructed location with controlled circulation pattern and access and the involvement of public display and great investment in the architectural idiom which is here the attention- focussing device. The court in front and the two axially placed wide entrances allowed participation by a larger community. The square can hold about 50 people, closely packed. Since the Roussolakkos settlement in its heyday may well have counted more than 5000 in- habitants, it is obvious that only a small proportion could have participated in whatever ritual was taking place. On the other hand, the ritual may not have been public at all but rather ephemeral, involving discrete, punctu- ated, individual visits. It seems reasonable then to suggest that the North- west Unit of Building 5 was set apart during LM IB for ritual or cult purposes. Shrines represent liminal zones, areas where ritual activity connects this and the world beyond. The consecration of an area originally apparently purely domestic was done through archi- tecture. In addition, the size of the chryselephantine statuette found here and the care given to its manufac- ture are well in line with the care given to the architec- tural embellishment of this part of the building and of this quarter of town, involving the square. These cult rooms consisted of two sizeable spaces with axial door- ways, accessible via steps from the Plateia. This would provide us with a communal cult area, or a town shrine, acting together with the Plateia in front. The position of the shrine on what may have been an important ac- cess road from the harbour may also be relevant. The Northwest Unit of Building 5 may then be re- constructed with full ashlar walls at ground floor level. It is difficult to envisage how the building looked from the N, from the open Area 6, during LM IB. The ashlar SW wall of Room 13 must have been visible. The back- drop of Building 1, a structure built entirely in ashlar, would have increased an impression of opulence, if in- deed it still stood at this time.5 In Chapter 2, the archi- tectural evidence for windows on the upper floor was discussed. It is possible that the ammouda slab found on top of the ivory torso served as a base to support a column which stood in a window, looking out over the Plateia above the main entrance to Room 1 with its fine paved floor and plastered receptacle.6 It is perhaps also worth repeating that a serpentine block with smoothed upper face was found in Room 2, SE of the pit which may itself have served for libations. This stone is dif- ferent from the building debris encountered normally, nor does it seem to have been used in manufacturing processes. At the same time, its shape does not really invite a comparison with known baetyls, which are much rounded as evidenced at Palaikastro (the cross-roads between Roads B-M-D-G), Gournia and Malia (Pal- ace Court) or iconographically.7 Nevertheless, this pos- sibility cannot be excluded. The well-stocked storage Room 13 allowed the shrine an economic independence or provided for consumption during ceremonies. Although there are set topographical locations for par- ticular types of shrines, such as peak sanctuaries, there is no standard or typical Minoan architectural form for a temple or even for a cult room, leaving aside the lustral basins.8 There can be little doubt, however, that, within palatial settlements, the palaces themselves or parts of these (West and Central Courts) were the main focal points of cult and ritual gatherings and the locus of public ceremonies,9 which served both the settlement and the surrounding territory. By implication, the rep- etition in the lay-out of the palaces should agree with a specific set of ritual prescriptions. Outside the urban environment, however, the situation may have been con- siderably different, as illustrated by the Middle Minoan Anemospilia Temple,10 although even this shrine may owe its existence to its dependence on the Iouktas peak sanctuary. Iconographie sources, however, leave no doubt about the importance of some kind of ritual build- ings, dubbed aedicula by Furumark, 'a small construc- tion of somewhat differing form, composed of archi- tectural elements such as columns, horns of consecra- tion and concave altar bases'.11 An ashlar building then was a frame, a proper milieu for ritual action: 'it was not a temple one was supposed to enter, or where ritu- als could be held, but was apparently of symbolic sig- nificance and sufficient in itself (Furumark 1965, 91). 5 This remains to be shown by the study for the final publica- tion of this complex structure. 0 An alternative source, îrom a pillar supporting a balcony over- looking the Plateia from the SE, is shown on Jerome's recon- struction at FIG. 1 . 1 1 . 7 For baetyls see Hood 1989, 17-21; Warren 199 10, 353-63; 1990^ 193-206. See also Renfrew 1981, 79, fig. 31, for the baetyl in front of the Shrine at Phylakopl. 8 To the list of Lustral Basins in Troubled Island, 60, add now a recently excavated example from the West Town at Knossos, referred to and illustrated in ADelt 47 (1992), 556-7, fig. 2. Rutkowski 1973, 290-3 assumed that temples in the Aegean did not have an established ground plan but were recognisable from their specific tripartite façades, perhaps decorated with running spirals. 9 See e.g. Pelon 1984, 61-74; Hood 1995, 393-407; Marinatos !993&gt; 38-39; Dickinson 1994, 277-8. 10 Most recently discussed in Sakellarakis and Sapouna- Sakellaraki 1997, 269-82; see also Lebessi and Muhly 1990 for the sacred enclosure at Symi which was more of an architecturally elaborated landscape in its main phase than a real building. 1 1 Furumark 1965, 91; Rutkowski 1901,1 1-34 and bchoep 19940, 204-06, fig. 22 for different types of aediculae depicted in Minoan iconography (esp. types A, B and C); Morgan 1988, 68-87, esp. p. 85 where she identifies a building because of its association with horns of consecration as *a shrine or a place which can be used as such when occasion calls'.</page><page sequence="3">A LATE MINOAN IB TOWN SHRINE AT PALAIKASTRO 89 Urban (as opposed to rural) buildings specifically set aside for cult seem, however, not to have formed part of mainstream Minoan ritual tradition until an advanced stage, except perhaps in regions where peak sanctuar- ies were absent, as at Middle Minoan Malia (see Schoep 19940, 20-4). The urban buildings given the label 'Town Shrine' by Hood12 comprise 'a building or roofed structure set apart for cult and having its own entrance from the out- side world, not incorporated in a dwelling house or pal- ace and approached through it. Some public shrines were evidently free-standing with paths or open spaces all around them. . .but others. . .although forming inde- pendent units with separate entrances, appear to have had one or more of their outside walls built against those of other structures, from which, however, there was no access. The inference is that these shrines, unlike the domestic ones inside palaces and houses, served a wider public than a single family or household, whether the population of the settlement at large, or a section of it united by ties of kinship or initiation'.13 Hood's obser- vations may be linked to Renfrew's seminal work on Aegean cult practices (Renfrew 1985). Indeed, one of the primary criteria for the identification of ritual con- sists in the focussing of attention. 'In communal acts of worship', Renfrew argues, 'this invariably requires a range of attention focussing devices. These are spatially and temporally specific: that is to say the acts are per- formed at special places, and these places are often or- ganised to facilitate the focussing of attention' (Ren- frew 1985, 18). The archaeological correlate for this is a special building set apart for sacred functions, often involving conspicuous public display and hidden ex- clusive mysteries, whose practice will be reflected in the architecture (see also J. W. Wright 1995, 341-8). With this in mind, we may briefly consider the Cretan evidence. Hood's list of 'Town Shrines' includes those at i. Gournia; ii. Fournou Korifi; iii. Agia Triada;14 iv. Koumasa;15 v. Malia Stratigraphical Museum; vi. Malia Sanctuary of the Horns; vii. Pseira; viii. Palaikastro Block 11; ix. Agia Irini on Kea; x. Rousses Chondrou16 and xi. Kannia-Mitropolis. Numbers ii, iv, v and vi need not concern us since they are either Early or Middle Minoan, while i, iii and xi are examples of typical LM III shrines which have since become better known.17 The 'Temple' at Agia Irini (ix) on Kea and the Shrine at Phylakopi on Melos offer certain points for compari- son with the Northwest Unit of Building 5 at Palaikastro from an architectural point of view since both are free- standing, axially organised structures. At Phylakopi, the identification of the LH HIA-B building as a shrine largely depends on its contents, although the axiality of its plan also sets it apart from domestic structures.18 The 'Temple' at Agia Irini is our most impressive ex- ample of a public shrine in the Aegean (see e.g. M. E. Caskey 1981, 127-36; 1986). Built early in the MBA, the building largely kept its plan throughout eight cen- turies of occupation. The axially placed, off-centre en- trances offer a parallel for our Building 5 situation. The evidence for LM I town shrines in Crete is not plenti- ful, with only vii and viii presenting convincing cases. The public shrine identified by Hood in areas 24, 38- 40 and 41-43 of Block II at Palaikastro (viii) is based on the excavation during the 1902-06 campaigns of an area where pottery, ritual objects - including bull's head rhyta and animal bones - accumulated. Although this may, in fact, represent destruction debris transported and dumped into the area, which was abandoned dur- ing or after the LM I A period,19 its composition ap- pears to derive its ritual association from its similari- ties with deposits in peak and rural sanctuaries, but its architectural context is not clear. This leaves the exam- ples at Gournia and Pseira. It can be argued that these, as is the case for Palaikastro-Building 5, are also LM IB town shrines. Although most of the contents of the Gournia shrine (i) are Postpalatial, the construction of the building is clearly Neopalatial, but must date rather late in that period since the building was constructed on top of an earlier Neopalatial structure (Russell 1979, 27-33; Rutkowski 1987, 58-62; Troubled Island, 56, 213). It belongs to an orderly part of the Neopalatial town, with traffic channeled towards its entrance. It consists of a single room, measuring about 3.0 x 4.0 m, and ac- cessible via three steps, as is the case with Building 5. Likewise, recent soundings in the Pseira 'shrine' also date it to a post-Santorini phase.20 Here too, traffic was 12 See Hood 1 977, 1 58-72 and the additional comments in Gesell I983, 93; see also the various contributions to Sanctuaries and Cults; see also Marinatos 1984, 22-3 who identifies shrines at Akrotiri on the basis of the occurrence of frescoes with reli- gious iconography, cult equipment and architectural features (such as large windows facing squares, interconnected rooms or simDlv laree soaces where DeoDle can eratherV 13 Hood 1977, plates A-D for comparative plans. 14 Dated to Neopalatial times by Hood 1977, 163, but recent soundings established its date as LM IIIA2-B (La Rosa 1984, 185-7). 1 5 Georgoulaki 1 990, 5-23 questions its identification as a shrine. 16 This may rather have been a normal house with a domestic cult area (Troubled Island. 219). 17 See the interesting remarks by Peatfield 1994, 19-36. 18 Renfrew 1985; the attention in the publication given to the architectural and spatial context, plan and reconstruction of the building (apart from its theoretical background, esp. p. 18- 19) is rather limited, in contrast to that given to the finds; see especially the architectural details (op. cit., 369, 374), and com- ments p. 390 about the scale, position and masonry, and p. 435-6 for possible parallels, although the axial symmetry and the occurrence of a bench is stressed. Renfrew (op. cit., 435), argues for a Cycladic origin of the built sanctuary with large cult images but fails to discuss the precise function of the cult area nor the possible functions of cult areas in general. 19 The presence of white ash is explicitly mentioned, a feature which we now tend to associate with Santorini tephra. 20 Building AC, cf. Betancourt and Davaras 1988, 215-18; Pseira II, 126-30 and Gesell 1985, 132.</page><page sequence="4">90 JAN DRIES S EN channeled to the SW side of the building and access was via steps and an offset entrance. Fragments of moulded plaster, belonging to at least one female figure, identi- fied as a goddess by the excavator, are said to have fallen from the upper floor into a portico opposite a small paved court (Seager 1 910, 15, pl. V; Kaiser 1976, 299- 302; Troubled Island, 246). The recent re-examination by P. P. Betancourt and K. Davaras has clarified its plan and architectural history and underlines the special sta- tus of the building within the Pseira community. The E wing in the country house at Kannia- Mitropolis clearly had a cult function, but again there is debate about its date (Levi 1959, 237-65; Hood 1977, 169-71; Troubled Island, 206-07) - LM IB and/or LM III. There are arguments, however, for associating the E part with the poor construction in front of the E façade, which has been tentatively identified as a tripartite shrine similar to the example at Vathypetro (Driessen and Sakellarakis 1997, 63-77; Troubled Island, 176-8, 206; Shaw 1978). If correct, both shrines, Kannia- Mitropolis and Vathypetro, may be added to the list of community cult places. Apart from these four parallels dating to LM IB, there is a possibility that House B2, recently excavated on the island at Mochlos, also served as the ritual cen- tre of the island during the LM IB period (Soles and Davaras 1996, 184-94; Troubled Island, 243). Surpris- ingly enough, this building, like Palaikastro Building 5, seems to have been rebuilt with an ashlar façade after the Santorini eruption. Moreover, some of the Palaces also underwent modifications in precisely this period to incorporate ritual areas {Troubled Island, 58). Both at Malia and Phaistos, several rooms were blocked off from the rest of the complex and given new entrances from outside (see Driessen 1997, 67-85). Within these rooms there are clear signs of ritual activity: at least five figurines and ritual equipment in Room 10 at Phaistos, and terracotta feet, tripod tables and a sand- stone altar with mason's marks (a star and a cross) in room XVIII: 1 at Malia. Both shrines had become inac- cessible from within the structures, at least at ground floor level, and this again provides parallels for the situ- ation in Building 5 at Palaikastro. Using this evidence, Driessen and Macdonald have recently suggested that a considerable change occurred in the ritual landscape of Crete during the crisis years after the Santorini erup- tion {Troubled Island, 54-61). Peak sanctuaries were mostly given up and cults were concentrated within set- tlements. Hence, urban, free-standing shrines came into use, a custom which would expand in Postpalatial Crete (Peatfield 1994). Palaikastro-Building 5, or rather Rooms 1, 2 and 13, may be placed somewhere between the urban shrines and the palatial examples,21 where some rooms were entirely closed off from the ground floor apartments and were given ashlar walls, wide door- ways, frescoes and plastered paving. Therefore, the unit may have served as the ritual centre for a large part of the town, if not for the entire settlement. The fact that several of the examples of town shrines (Gournia, Kannia, Kea) are re-used in LM III may be an argu- ment for religious continuity. I would not exclude the possibility that the LM II-HI successor of the LM IB Palaikastro shrine also had a ritual function. The ar- chitectural lay-out is remarkably consistent and Room 2 is given a bench, a characteristic feature of shrines elsewhere. Unfortunately, the room was found empty so that the question remains open.22 The following features seem then to characterise Minoan urban shrines of the LM IB period:23 i. Access from a major circulation artery, preferably a square, ii. Access through a stepped entrance, perhaps so planned for symbolic reasons, iii. Wide entrances, iv. Axial alignment, v. Architectural embellishment. THE FUNCTION OF THE SHRINE There is a wide variety of Minoan cult places, usually identified on the basis of the discovery of votives (do- mestic or palatial sanctuaries), sometimes on the basis of architectural form (lustral basins, sacred spaces on courts, tripartite shrines) or on a combination of topo- graphical features and votives (caves, peak sanctuaries, spring sanctuaries and/or sacred enclosures).24 The identification of the Northwest Unit of Building 5 as a public shrine is supported by the above architectural and spatial observations. The built environment dic- tated an artificial milieu for the ritual action and deter- 21 The NE orientation of the Northwest Unit of Building 5 at Palaikastro does not betray any immediate recognizable ritual significance. Compare with the E orientation of the Kannia- Mitropolis, Vathypetro and Mochlos shrines (as well as most of the palaces cf. Shaw 1977, 47-59), the W orientation of the entrance of the Gournia shrine, the SE orientation of those at Pseira, Phylakopi and Agia Irini. See also van Leuven 1978 for the orientation of mainland shrines. To be consulted (with some caution) is also the paper by Blomberg and Henriksson 1996, 27-39- 22 Close-by to the E, however, some twelve fragments of discarded terracotta figurines were found together with LM IIIA2/B pottery (PK 1988, 434, fig. 14; PK iggo, 133, fig. 9 nos. 4, 5). N of the area, in Building 4, more figurines were found, one also showing the belted warrior (PK iq88, 432, fig. 12, 13). 23 Cf. Fernandez 1985, 259 on the orientation o' buildings and rooms, the access, internal organisation and circulation pat- tern, size and furniture. 24 Rutkowski 1972, 39; Marinatos 1993, passim; Barshinger 1987; van Leuven 1981, 12, prefers to distinguish simply between natural and built sanctuaries; Dickinson 1994, 266-7 distin- guishes between buildings which are or incorporate shrines, open-air sites, caves and tombs; for a critical assessment, see Fernandez 1985.</page><page sequence="5">A LATE MINOAN IB TOWN SHRINE AT PALAIKASTRO 91 mined the amount of space, the length of time, the number of people and the type of activity. Built shrines can have different functions, however, and the variety of cultic assemblages on Minoan Crete warns us against generalisations. Nilsson's often cited definition of a shrine as 'a separate building set apart to be the abode of the deity and to shelter its image and paraphernalia' (Nilsson 1950, 77) seems rather limited and Rutkowski's 'cult place' is a better definition to start from as it implies notions of topography, ritual actions and religious beliefs: 'the cult place must be clearly de- scribed from the point of view of the topography, so the boundaries have to be drawn between the holy place and the secular surroundings, and features such as al- tars, cult objects, images, sanctuaries, votive offerings, etc. have to be present. The second of the connotations is concerned with what happens at the cult site - for instance, the rites performed by priests, processions, dances, cult mysteries, and the making of sacrifices. And finally, coming to the third connotation, the cult place is so called because of its connection with religion - people came to it because there were manifestations of the deity there, or because it was a place where a being with superhuman powers dwelled or which such a be- ing visited' (Rutkowski 1972, 16). Although already more useful, this definition implies certain preconceived ideas about religion and cult activity in general which need to be proven. Elsewhere, Rutkowski simply dis- tinguishes between a 'sanctuary' in the narrow sense of a building intended for use in a wide range of cult prac- tices, and public buildings accessible to the entire popu- lation of a town or village which are labelled 'temples'.25 If the difference between the terms used is one of par- ticipation, the scale of the building involved would pro- vide us with a reliable indicator. However, he (and oth- ers) regard 'Temples' also as the dwelling-place of some divinity. If so, an aniconic or anthropomorphic image should be present. Since such cases are extremely rare on Minoan Crete (excluding the LM HI period), as we will discuss below, the island apparently counted very few temples indeed. One should then perhaps better distinguish between: i. Cult areas which served to house a cult statue per- manently or occasionally, without themselves hav- ing major relevance since the statue is taken out at festivals. In these cases, the building acts more as a repository than as an actual liminal meeting point. ii. Cult areas which were considered as home of the gods on earth and therefore as some kind of Holy of Holies. Depending on the nature of the religion, the shrine may only have been accessible by the initiated and the priests, or provide space for a larger community of worshippers. iii. Cult areas serving for ritual actions inviting the epiphany of the divinity.26 Here the shrine serves as a milieu for the action and its architectural mani- festation as such bore symbolism. Clearly the archaeological correlate of each type of shrine involved will be different. Moreover, case and context of the Palaikastro Kouros are unique in that they are not paralleled by other examples. The ques- tion of the specific function of the building at Palaikastro then is closely related to the function of the chryselephantine statue (PK 1987, 267). Human im- agery in religious contexts can have different meanings. Renfrew distinguishes between four categories:27 i. Representations of anthropomorphic deities, ii. Representations of abstract deities, iii. Votaries or images of worshippers, iv. Votive offerings, representing either the deities or humans.28 Moreover, a representation of a deity does not always represent a cult statue and the different categories can occur at the same time. With regard to the Aegean, it is evident from find circumstances that the Palaikastro Kouros is difficult to compare with the 55 statues and figurines from the shrine on Kea or the approximately 20 figures from one room (but only a single larger one) in the Temple at Mycenae. Again we have to be careful not to make generalisations since temporal and spatial differences may exist within Crete itself. Since the con- text of the Palaikastro Kouros is unique, comparative evidence can never provide definitive answers. 25 Rutkowski 1972, 17: only Gournia and Karphi are labelled Temples; Rutkowski 1973, 291 describes temples as 'a divini- ty's house, keeping its image or its paraphernalia'. 26 For rituals in general, see Hargrove 1979; for Minoan ritual action, see Warren 1986; For Marinatos 1984, 22, a shrine served to accomodate priests only who could perform rituals on behalf of the community, which itself would be gathering in a nearby open space. 27 Renfrew 1985, 22-3; 372-3; cf. Warren 1986, 33: 'An image, a central focus of activity, could have been understood either as a plain image of a divinity without any immanent power, a cult statue pure and simple, or as an image which was a vehicle of divine power, either temporarily during ritual (like the baetyls) or permanently, or as an image which was a concrete expres- sion of a divinity envisioned in an ecstatic epiphany, or as a permanent image or model of a priestess conducting ritual such as an enacted epiphany. As with the believed anthropomor- phic presence which we have argued lay behind painted or engraved representations of divinity, so too in the latter three of our proposed understandings of images a believed real pres- ence is implied' (his italics). 28 Cf. Alroth 1989, 15, on the relationship between the appear- ance of votive figurines intended to represent a deity and that of the cult image itself in Early Greek sanctuaries. She con- cludes that such an influence is rarely detectable (p. 106). Furumark (1965, 91) assumed the opposite for Minoan votives: 'these so-called goddesses probably represent priestesses who during the rite appear in the goddess 's image, and represent her. They can therefore give us an idea of the type of ritual, also possibly a suggestion of the character or identity of the god- dess in question' (his italics).</page><page sequence="6">92 JAN DRIES S EN The main question for Minoan Crete up to 1450 BC is whether three-dimensional representations of anthro- pomorphic deities existed at all. Hägg and Marinatos, accepting non-anthropomorphic cult objects such as stalagmites, stalactites, pillars, fetishes and baetyls with- out much hesitation, are much more reluctant to ac- cept the existence of anthropomorphic cult images on Minoan Crete (Marinatos and Hägg 1983, 185-201; cf. Matz 1958, 28-43). They accept the evidence for life- size human statuary but assume that these portray votives, representing either worshippers or divinities. This, they argue, is because the epiphany of the deity was central to Minoan religion and the rituals involved the appearance of the divinity, something which could take place at any time and anywhere, but preferably outside. Since they doubt the existence of cult images, they likewise do not accept the existence of specific ar- chitectural forms that can be described as 'Temples' on Minoan Crete (meaning the abode of the deity). They make some salient points which need consideration. First of all, it must be noted that the idea of epiphany does not necessarily contradict the existence of cult stat- ues. The lack of a standard architectural form does in- deed suggest that 'Temples' as defined by Nilsson as abodes of the deities do not find a place in Minoan cult. This may, however, still imply that specific architec- tural units served either as repositories of images which, on certain occasions, served the epiphany of the deity, or units which formed the built environment for spe- cific cult actions. The difference would be that between a freely accessible communal shrine, a strictly control- led repository from which the image was taken solely during ceremonies, and a building which existed in its own right. Secondly, there can be no doubt that large and even life-size anthropomorphic statues existed on Minoan Crete, in terracotta, stone, faience or composite mate- rials. Large terracotta statues depicting humans are rare on Crete before LM II-IHAi. Most of the Petsophas male figures, for instance, are less than 0.20 m high al- though there are examples from other contexts ap- proaching 0.50 m.29 One notable exception is the frag- ment of a large human face from Petsophas which may originally have been 1.00 m high.30 On Iouktas, how- ever, Karetsou found fragments which must have come from clay male idols of a height of at least 0.80 m (Karetsou 1981, 146). The largest figure from the Tem- ple at Agia Irini on Kea, however, would have stood more than 1.5 m high and several statues approach 1 m. Later statues, from Crete, the Mainland or the is- lands, vary in height but again rarely exceed 0.75 m. In stone, there is an EM stone figure from Samba which is 0.675 m high (Sapouna-Sakellaraki 1983, 44- 74) and a roughly half life-size marble arm from the Room of the Stone Vases in the Palace at Knossos (Evans 1900, 31). A mould fragment for an approximately life- size hand (in bronze ?) was also found at Phaistos (Laviosa 1968, 499-510). Perhaps the best parallel for the Palaikastro Kouros is provided by three faience figures, about 0.30 m high, the so-called 'Snake Goddesses' from the Temple Re- positories at Knossos, stratified at about the time of the Thera eruption.31 Some indirect evidence for the existence of larger statuary is provided by the terracotta feet in the shrine in the Palace at Malia and those from the Temple at Anemospilia.32 Together with five feet from Room G3, NE of the Temple at Agia Irini and other examples from the Palaces at Phaistos and Zakro and from houses at Sklavokampos, Mochlos-Limanari and Gournia,33 these may very well have served to support wooden statues or xoana. The other evidence listed by the Sakellarakises, including the heavy steatite wig weighing six kilograms {PM HI, 419-22, fig. 288) and the bronze locks from the Knossos palace, originally thought by Evans to be- long to a statue 2.80 m high,34 also seems to corrobo- rate the existence of such composite statues.35 Thirdly, it has to be admitted that the evidence for Minoan cult statues is somewhat circumstantial and con- troversial.36 The identification of an anthropomorphic deity or the interpretation of a human image as a cult statue is partly helped by the quality, scale, gesture and 29 Rutkowski 1 99 1, 22. A terracotta torso of a belted warrior in the Museum of Fine Arts at Boston (Annual Report 1992-93, 22) is preserved to a height of 0.14 m and could have stood originally about 0.50 m (compare with the torso of the Palaikastro Kouros). 30 PK II, 375, Plate XII.34; Hood 1978, 106, n. 132; Rutkowski 1 99 1, 80, wonders whether the face could not have belonged to a vessel. A male warrior from Kannia-Mitropolis (H. 0.385 m) is probably LM III (Renfrew 1985, 421-2). Female figures are usually even smaller. 31 PM I, 500-10; Troubled Island, 141; the largest figure is 0.342 m (reconstructed); the other, a headless female figure, is 0.20 m (to neck, but restored); a third figure, more or less preserved to the waist, would have been slightly taller; see also Panagiotaki 1993, 49-91, esp. 54-9 on some other pieces from the same context. 32 Sakellarakis and Sapouna-Sakellaraki 1997, 530-9 for a de- tailed discussion citing all the relevant literature. 33 Troubled Island, 6 1 ; Sakellarakis and Sapouna-Sakellaraki 1 997, 531 citing other examples; see Donahue 1988, 211 and passim for xoana. 34 PM III, 522-5, fig. 366; Marinatos and Hägg 1983, 194; Hägg 1995, 367, prefers to see these as belonging to several, smaller statues about 0.30 m tall. 35 See also P. M. Warren's review of Renfrew 1985 in Antiquity 60(1986), 155-6. 36 Dickinson 1994, 265. Most authors m fact do not accept their existence before the LM III period, e.g. Matz 1958; Furumark 1965, 91.

The quality of the statue. Although in part circu- lar reasoning, the finest statue in a deposit is al- ways identified as the cult statue. ii. The scale of the statue. As mentioned above, those Aegean statues identified as cult images are either quite tall, when found on their own, or exceed the associated figures in height. Thus Evans calls the largest faience statue from the Temple Repositor- ies the Goddess whereas the two smaller images are labelled attendants, priestesses or votaries (PM I, 500-10, fig. 377). iii. The gesture of the statue. Minoan ritual idiom in Neopalatial times follows set gestures. Hence, male and female votaries are almost always depicted holding one hand to the brow. The gesture of the Belted Hunter, as discussed in Chapter 9, is re- served for very few Minoan pieces and recurs in other types of iconography. iv. The number of the statues. As Hood observed (1977, 169-70), Minoan town shrines are usually devoid of finds, an observation which applies to Building 5 at Palaikastro and the so-called Shrine on Pseira. The Sakellarakises also rightly draw at- tention to the fact that the terracotta feet found in the MM Anemospilia Temple or those found in the LM I Palaces or shrines elsewhere were usu- ally not accompanied by other dedications (Sakellarakis and Sapouna-Sakellaraki 1997, 532- 3) - this in contrast to peak, rural and domestic sanctuaries where representational terracotta votives abound. This is of course negative evidence but it could imply that a wooden cult statue (a xoanon) or indeed an anthropomorphic cult statue was considered sufficient for ritual focus and that it was 'without rivals for attention' (Renfrew 1985, 23). v. The context of the statue. Except for the number and presence of votives, the architectural context and location of the statue should be conclusive. Un- fortunately there are only rare Cretan contexts be- fore LM II in which a statue seems to take a spe- cial position. Apart from the Anemospilia xoanon, there is the 'spouted goddess' from EM II Fournou Korifi, found fallen from a bench.37 The special context of the Snake Goddess from the Temple Repositories may, in the present writer's opinion, also be in favour of an interpretation of this figure as a cult statue,38 although its original location re- mains problematic. The palatial shrines of Malia and Phaistos can also be described as special con- texts: accessible from the outside and not commu- nicating with the rest of the complex, they have ritual equipment which may have included an an- thropomorphic image. Room 10 in the West Wing of the Palace at Phaistos was fitted with benches and on these stood at least five female figures, though only one was completely preserved (H. 0. 17 m) (Festos II, 114, fig. 62; Troubled Island, 197). Room XVIII: 1 in the South Wing of the Palace at Malia contained some ritual pottery as well as a small stone altar and two terracotta feet,39 which could have belonged to a xoanon. A combination of these five criteria was used to inter- pret the Phylakopi assemblage: the sheer number of fig- ures in the different rooms suggested that they were votives or images of votaries, also alluded to by their gesture, with the arms held forward. Only the 'Lady of Phylakopi', standing 0.45 m high in a specific locus in Room A and with a different gesture, was a good candi- date for a cult image. Thus, both the height, the ges- ture and the exceptional materials used for the Palaikastro Kouros support the suggestion that the statue was more than an ex-voto, especially since ex- votos rarely or never show up on their own without other cult paraphernalia.40 Nevertheless, it is striking that active cult areas in- volving anthropomorphic representations remain a rar- ity in the Minoan archaeological record. Except for EM Fournou Korifi and MM II Anemospilia, all other evi- dence seems to cluster in the LM IB period. This raises the possibility that we should regard this phase as an aberration, as a transitional phase without which the later Mycenaean occupation and cults on the island are more difficult to understand and one which provides a prelude to the later situation.41 If the hypothesis that the Palaikastro Kouros was a cult statue is accepted, the representation of an anthro- pomorphic divinity, we still have to face the question of whether or not the statue was used for permanent dis- play and devotion. If the Central and West Courts of 37 Warren 1972, 78-87, 209-10; 1977, 137-47 for a full discus- sion. 38 As suggested by Hood 1078. m and Panagiotaki io&lt;n, 8«&gt;-7. 1Q Troubled Island* 184. (for references). 40 The statue may have been quite new when deposited but there does not seem to be sufficient evidence to suggest a workshop situation (see comments by Evely in Chapter 1 above). Al- though Palaikastro has produced other exquisite ivories and seems to have supported its own craftsmen (Hood 1978, 121), and some ivory pegs and a disc as well as bronze chisels and tweezers were found in room 9 of Building 5 (FIG. 1.9: 1 and 6, PLATE J/ and cf. PK ig88, 426, plate 6od.e), as well as a collection of bone and ivory plaques and strips hidden in Room 13 (PLATE 4 c, and cf. PK iggo, 130, plate iod), a workshop context such as that at Knossos is lacking, nor were any gold foil or ivorv scrans found elsewhere in the building 41 Troubled Island, 94-7, esp. 96, for the suggestion that this rep- resents a 'crisis cult' (La Barre 1971, 3-7), somewhat similar perhaps to the rather unusual ritual context found by Warren in his excavation behind the Stratigraphical Museum at Knossos (Warren 1981, 155-67).</page><page sequence="8">94 JAN DRIES S EN the palaces were meant for rituals and public festivals, as suggested by iconographie sources, it is clear that communal gatherings were a prime feature of the ritual activities involved. Several frescoes also stress that 'dis- play' or ritual equipment was a major concern.42 At first glance, participation in rituals by larger groups outside the Palaces seems rather the exception than the rule, since the size and amenities of the urban shrines dis- cussed earlier can only have involved a few dozen peo- ple at most. Remembering that the so-called Palace Treasuries contained ritual equipment, especially in- cluding finely decorated stone rhyta and other para- phernalia, which was probably to be used for public display and ceremony in other locations such as the Courts, we may ask whether the Palaikastro Kouros was intended to be 'housed' in a shrine, the NW rooms of Building 5, where it might have been displayed, or whether this building served only as a repository, from which the statue was brought occasionally to a larger gathering place outside? All LM IB shrines,43 whether urban or part of Palaces, have in common that they are situated close to larger courts or open spaces. The 'shrines' at Palaikastro, Pseira and Gournia are located on corridor-like (even processional) roads leading to open areas, which, at Palaikastro are either Area 6 or the open terrain E of Building i. The tripartite organi- sation of the façade of Building i, adorned with at least one pair of horns of consecration {PKiq8j, 265), would provide a suitable backdrop for any ceremony.44 This possibility cannot be excluded, partly because it would help to explain the enormous investment put into the construction of Building 1 and its architectural link to Building 5 via an ashlar screen wall alongside the Plateia. As mentioned in the introduction to this Chapter, Area 6 remained unoccupied during LM IB, apart from two wells. The different pairs of stone horns found in one well and the serpentine dolphin rhyton found in the other well could then conceivably also have played a part in a larger ritual, giving Area 6 the appearance of a sacred enclosure (cf. Lebessi and Muhly 1990, 316, fig. 1). In view of the epiphanic character of Minoan reli- gion, one could conjecture that the statue usually rested in the receptacle in Room 2 with only its base as an aniconic marker visible through the open doors. One could, in such a case, assume an initial ritual display or an appearance of the Palaikastro Kouros in Building 5 itself, involving a restricted group of initiated in the Plateia, and followed by a solemn procession in which the Kouros was brought to an open area where the en- tire community could participate. Appealing as such a hypothesis may be, it remains just that.45 THE ORIGINAL LOCATION OF THE STATUE As discussed in detail in the previous Chapters, the torso, feet and head of the statue were found on the surface of the Plateia beneath destruction debris whereas the legs were lying on the floor of Room 2, about 10 m away. Both deposits were clear LM IB de- struction deposits. The spatial separation between the fragments is most likely due to human agency, perhaps an act of malicious vandalism, during which the statue was deliberately broken into different parts. As pro- posed by Moak in Chapter 5, the distribution and dis- persal of fragments in the square and the traces and modalities of damage observed on the individual pieces, suggest that the statue with its base was taken outside into the Plateia. The statue may have been held by its higher legs in a person's right hand and crashed in a southwesterly direction, face first, into the right-hand stone door-post of the main entrance of Building 5. This action would have shattered the face and could have caused both the stone skull and upper torso to fly to the NE. The heels with pegs inserted in the wooden base of the statue, covered with Egyptian blue and golden dots, must have come off the legs and front part of the feet at the same time. Holding just the legs in his hand, he seems to have thrown these through the open doorways into Room 2, which may already have been burning at this point. We can only guess at the motives for such a malicious destruction. Iconoclasm can cer- tainly not be ruled out but there are other possibilities: a desperate attempt by the occupant of the house to keep the statue from leaving the site by breaking it; sim- ple malicious destruction as part of the loot of the town (perhaps from anger that the statue was not in pure gold); or destruction of religious symbols which were too closely associated with a certain elite. There is some evidence from other LM IB sites on Crete which sup- ports this last possibility since most stone rhyta with figurative representations and many stone horns of con- secration were also found broken.46 A combination of the social and religious motives is also a possibility: the rarity of anthropomorphic images in shrines,47 their temporal concentration in the LM IB period and the obvious elite connotations (the materials, the ashlar building) may imply that both the statue itself and what 42 Stressed by the new frescoes of Xesti 4 at Akrotiri, Thera, where a man carries elaborate cult equipment (Ergon 1996, 75, fig. 61). 43 It also remains a possibility that the Palaikastro Kouros was kept in the pit in Room 2 of Building 5 which, as at Knossos, could have served as a repository for ritual equipment. *-+ /»rit d Ci ,. 1 __/* * * ..-•.* /* 1 - _ - _ t^____ 44 L.I. önaw 1970, 420 on ine use 01 iriparuie iaçaucs as appro- priate backdrops for still incompletely known ceremonies that were carried out in front of them, usually within courts'. 45 The precise ritual is now no longer identifiable: see Warren 1986, 13 ff. for dance, baetylic, robe, flower and sacrifice ritu- als. 46 Troubled Island, 109; for other suggestions, see Rehak 1994, 1-6; 1995, 435-60. 47 Hägg 1995, 367 also sees an emphasis on anthropomorphic figures in religious iconography during LM I.</page><page sequence="9">A LATE MINOAN IB TOWN SHRINE AT PALAIKASTRO 95 it stood for invited enmity, causing its eventual shatter- ing. The final position of the fragments, however, betrays little about the original location of the piece since, if the above reconstruction of its depositional process is accepted, the final resting place of the statue - in an accidental primary deposit - does not have to corre- spond with the location where it was originally dis- played. For the present writer, however, there is little doubt that the statue indeed derives from Room 2 in Building 5. Room 13 seems out of the question because of its function as a magazine, although one might argue that the statue was hidden at some point behind one of the storage vases, together with the other ivory fragments. Most Minoan cult areas and shrines seem to have in- cluded storage areas (Gesell 1983, 93; Pilali-Papasteriou 1987, 179-86). These could have given the shrine some economic independence or allowed the distribution of food and drink during specific festivals. In favour of Room 1 are its architectural and plaster decoration and initially, before the excavation was com- pleted, we had conjectured that the statue might have stood on the low plaster dais in Room ic (see watercol- our reconstruction at PLATE N b). In this case, how- ever, the small partition wall between Rooms ia and ib would have hidden the statue from view by anyone en- tering the building from outside. Nor would the wide entrance to Room 2 have been necessary. The paving and fresco decoration of Room 1 seem to serve rather as a sign-post, a 'red carpet' somewhat similar to the raised walks in palace courts, signalling the way of ap- proach to the main focus of ritual. Thus Room ia can be seen as a transitional or ante-room, a vestibule.48 Evidence in favour of Room 2 is that: i. The legs were after all found in this room, together with some other tiny gold and ivory fragments. ii. It only makes sense to block the doorways from Room 2 into the rest of the building if this room had a special function. iii. The same observation applies to the refurbishing with ashlar: this operation served to monumentalise three rooms, i.e. they were set apart as an entity. i v. The slabbed pit in front of the entrance of Room 2 may have served as some kind of treasury, similar to the Kasselles and Temple Repositories at Knossos, or for libations, as suggested by the pres- ence of an amphora next to it. The serpentine block (0.385 x 0.20 x 0.23 m) in Room 2 may conceiv- ably have been a baetyl. Its worn upper surface implies intentional rubbing. v. The axiality of the wide doorways as well as the 'red carpet' in Room 1 serve as attention-focussing devices for Room 2. vi. Finally, in other axial sanctuaries with cult images, it is always the inner room which serves as the 'Holy of Holies' (e.g. Kea-Temple Room 1; Phylakopi- Shrine Room A). The statue must have stood on a wooden base in which the pegs for the feet would have been concealed. This base was undoubtedly painted with Egyptian blue and decorated with golden flecks, as discussed by Moak. It may be conjectured that this wooden base resembled a small square stone base from the Mt. Kophinas Peak Sanctuary (KO Za i). This measures o.n x 0.08 m and is 0.063 m high. Its upper surface shows two small cavities, undoubtedly to support a similar (but smaller ?) statue and its side is adorned with a Linear A in- scription.49 It may further perhaps be conjectured that statue and base stood on a higher pedestal. A fine re-used ashlar block (0.72 x 0.46 x 0.26 m) was incorporated into a LM III bench in Room 2 and it would make a good candidate for such a function. Stone pedestal and wooden base would have stood to a height of about 0.80 m. Including the statue, 0.50 m high, this would give a height of 1.30 m. Its most likely location would then perhaps be in a line behind the steps, axial doorways and pit, close to the partition wall with Room 13, and very visible from the Plateia, when the doors were open (see David Parfitt's drawn reconstruction at FIG. 6.1). 48 Cf. Gesell 1983, 93; Rooms ib-c could have served as prepa- ration areas or spaces where other cui tic equipment was stored. 49 I owe this suggestion to Dr. I. Schoep.</page><page sequence="10">96 JANDRIESSEN Fig. 6.1. Reconstruction of a town shrine for the Kouros at Building 5. Drawing by David Parfitt.</page></plain_text>
