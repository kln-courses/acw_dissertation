<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CHILD MANIFESTATION OF SIVA IN CONTEMPORARY HINDU POPULAR PRINTS KNUT A. JACOBSEN Summary God posters have become one of the most visible aspects of popular religious culture in South Asia. In this article I argue that the God poster industry has created opportunities for iconographic innovations, but that the God posters nevertheless build on traditional sacred narratives and conceptions of the Hindu gods found especially in the Hindu epics and the Puranas. Even if the iconographic representation of the child manifestations of Siva is something new, these God posters rely on the presence of the child manifestations of Siva in the sacred narratives of the Hindu tradition. While only some of the episodes of Siva as a child till now have been depicted in the God posters, it is not unreasonable to expect that more episodes involving the manifestation of Siva as a child will be depicted in God posters in the future. During the last one hundred years colourful prints of the Hindu gods, usually called God posters, have become one of the most visible aspects of popular religious culture in South Asia.' There is hardly a Hindu home, shop or workshop without one print or more on the wall or on the pija table.2 God posters are printed in many different sizes, 1 For studies of Hindu God posters see Joshi 1994; Neumayer and Schelberger 2003. For an evaluation of the influence of the God poster industry on Hinduism, see Smith 1995, and Inglis 1995. 2 The most important use of God posters is for darsan, a ritual auspicious viewing of God. The God posters help to make the daily paja at home possible and they demand much less work than do sculptures and figures. Not all God posters, however, are darian pictures. A second type of posters is the Mtla poster. They portray various situations from the sacred narratives. In these pictures, in contrast to the darian posters, the eyes of the gods are not looking at the devotee, therefore they cannot be used for darian. In addition to these two types the posters from pilgrimage places (ttrthas) are very popular. A fourth category of posters depicts holy persons or illustrates religious doctrines. ?

It is usually recognised that one of the most innovative contributions to Indian iconography of the God posters is in the expansion of the idea of the child-god.3 God posters portraying Krsna, Rdma, Hanuman, Ganesa, Murugan, Pdrvati and also Siva as children are these days available for sale in the market in India and abroad. Even if narratives about the child manifestation of some of these gods may be found in the sacred scriptures of the Hindu tradition, the best known being those of Krsna, their portrayals in the God posters are often iconographic innovations. During the last fifteen years posters have been produced depicting Siva as child. The traditional ways of representing Siva in sculptures and paintings do not usually include a child manifestation.4 The God posters of Siva as a child represent therefore something new (see Figure 1). It may be tempting to reject God posters of Siva as child as the free fantasy of the artists, as Hindus, and scholars, when I ask them, often do. The lack of information about Siva as child also in the academic accounts gives the impression that these God posters depict something totally new, that they are based only on the imagination of the artist. Even Sudhir Kakar in his study of childhood in India (Kakar 1981) does not mention anything about Siva as child although he makes 3 Pal 1997. The child manifestation of Siva is however not mentioned in the essay. 4 Siva is represented in sculptures and pictures in principally five forms. First, he is the Lord of Yoga. As the Lord of Yoga he sits in lotus position on a tiger skin. He has a snake around his neck, the moon in his hair and the river Gafiga flows from his matted hair. His second form is as Nataraja, the Lord of dance. He dances within a circle of fire on a dwarf who symbolizes ignorance. The dance expresses Siva as creator, preserver and destroyer of the universe. In his other forms he is usually portrayed together with a woman or a symbol of the female principle. His third form is as a family man portrayed with his wife Parvati and the two children Skanda and Ganesa. His fourth form is aniconic. He is represented with the liniga, his sexual organ, and this is his most common manifestation in temples and sacred places in India. Siva's litiga is placed within a yoni, the female sexual organ. This represents the union of Siva and his female power, Sakti. His fifth form also represents the union of Siva and Sakti but in anthropomorphic form. In this form called "the God that is half female" (ardhanartivara) he is a person that is half male and half female.</page><page sequence="3">The Child Manifestation of Siva in Hindu Popular Prints 239 Figure 1. God poster depicting Siva as child.</page><page sequence="4">240 Knut A. Jacobsen plenty use of the sacred narratives about Siva and the study contains a long appendix about the child in Hindu mythological traditions. In this article I document that several narratives of Siva as a child are found in the epics and the Puranas and argue that the modem God poster industry which for the first time has made this divine manifestation well known, has based its drawings not only on artistic creativity, but also on knowledge of the sacred scriptures. What is new is the iconographic representations, not the figure depicted.5 The flourishing God poster industry is depicting a variety of themes and events which were never previously represented in pictures, but the themes and events are nevertheless often from the sacred narratives. Sacred narratives of Siva as a child are found in the sacred texts of Hinduism and some of the posters do indeed illustrate sacred narratives found in the Saiva Purdnas. The artists re-actualise themes from the Purdnas and in that way they follow the tradition of the founder of the Hindu God poster industry, Raja Ravi Varma.6 Siva as child is known in the 5 Joshi writes: "Sometimes it is believed that an artist has unlimited freedom in giving form to the formless. In fact, the choices and imagination of artists are limited. Limits are imposed by the descriptions of the gods and deities found in epics, prayers, hymns, and in other religious texts" (1994:2). 6 The God poster industry goes back to the artist Raja Ravi Varma (1848-1906) who, influenced by English landscape paintings, made romantic pictures of the Hindu gods and goddesses as they are portrayed especially in the Puranas. Varma's pictures were first sent to Europe to be printed and the printed pictures were returned to India to be sold there. Varma thereafter started the first printing press for God posters in India. The success of Varma led a series of new artists to produce pictures for the growing God poster industry. The most influential after Varma was C. Kondiah Raju (1898- 1976) from Chennai. His pictures were however printed in quite different numbers. While Varma struggled for days to produce a few hundred prints from his press, already in the 1950ies factories could produce several hundred thousand prints a day. Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu became established as the centre for the production of prints and each of the biggest companies there such as Sankareswari, Orient, and Coronation, print more than ten million prints a year. The most productive and popular artists such as M. Ramalingkum, a student of C. Kondiah Raju, who produced over one hundred pictures a year, each printed in more than 100000 copies, must be one of the most popular artists in the world (see Inglis 1995).</page><page sequence="5">The Child Manifestation of Siva in Hindu Popular Prints 241 scriptures and the God posters depict several of these stories. What are new, therefore, are the iconographic representations, not the themes as such. The iconographic innovations are more related to technological transformation and less to religious change. Technological innovation, however, has made popular a form of Siva that previously hardly any Hindus knew about and has therefore influenced contemporary popular conceptions of the god. The child god posters are expressions of the growing popularity of the child manifestations of the gods, especially Krsna, in recent times. The child gods often symbolise innocence and benevolence, and their popularity reflects, perhaps, religious change following from increased urbanisation and the growth of the urban middle class. Siva as a Child The child manifestation of Siva has in fact a Vedic basis. Siva as child is known already from the Sathapatha Brahmana 6.1.3, a text which is difficult to date, but is most certainly from before the common era. The name Siva means "auspicious" and was one of the epithets of the Vedic god Rudra. Rudra might be derived from the Sanskrit root rud that means "to cry" or "to howl." Rudra is the one who cries (rodati). The name has perhaps its background in his child manifestation. Rudra in Sathapatha Brahmana is identified with Agni and is one of his forms. He is born from Prajapati. In the later adaptations of this story in the Purdnas, Brahma becomes Rudra's father.7 Prajapati asked Rudra when he was born, "Why do you cry?" Rudra answered that he cried because he needed a name so that he could be liberated from evil, preferable several names so that he could be liberated again and again. Prajipati answered, "You are 'Rudra.' " He receives thereafter eight names that connect him to fire (Agni), water (Sarva), plants (Padupati), wind (Vayu), lightning (Asani), rain (Bhava), the moon (Mahideva), and the sun (1iana). These are the eight forms of Agni and the child (kumdra) is the ninth form. The name Rudra is identified with Agni, fire, so that the final 7 See for example Vayu Purana 1.27, part 1, pp. 176-81.</page><page sequence="6">242 Knut A. Jacobsen number becomes eight.8 The child enters the other eight forms, for one never sees the child, only the eight manifestations, the text says. Siva has, according to the later theological and mythological traditions, eight cosmic forms: water, fire, air, heaven, earth, sun, moon, and the sacrificer. This is Siva in the shape of the empirical universe, while his child manifestation is hidden, the text says.9 Siva Manifests Himself as a Child to Fulfil the Wish of the Childless for a Child The Vedic Rudra was worshipped partly because he had the power to fulfil the wish for a son.10 Siva as lir~ga is an obvious fertility symbol. Siva as lirfga is therefore worshipped for the sake of increased fertility, also human fertility. Also the manifestation of Siva as child is connected to the wish of the childless for a child. In the Skanda Purana and the Siva Purana the story of the childless Visvanara and Sucismati is told." Sucismati wanted a son, and when she thought about the son she wanted, she realised that she wanted a son who was similar to Siva, that is, the child image of Siva appeared to her. Viivdnara thought that it had to be Siva who had wished this through her and he therefore went to Varanasi, the city of Siva. There, he worshipped Siva in the form of a lifiga and performed asceticism for a year. He wondered about which lirnga to worship as the most efficient means to get a son. The text therefore lists the different linigas of Varanasi and says 8 Rudra is here associated with rain and lightning. This connects him to the shining light and to the fertile water. 9 There is an interesting connection between the child-god and the organising of the universe. The child-god is the world and is hidden in the world. In the later texts of Kashmir Saivism, the idea that Siva is hidden in the world manifestation is emphasised. His participation in the world manifestation is connected to the principle of play (lila), but in this system the mythological aspects of Siva are not emphasised. For 11d in Kashmir Saivism see Biumer 1995. 10 Maity 1989:38. 1 Skanda Purdna, Kai-khanda, Pirvardha, chapter 10, pp. 90-117; Siva Purana, Satarudrasamhita, chapters 13-14, pp. 1123-39.</page><page sequence="7">The Child Manifestation of Siva in Hindu Popular Prints 243 that the most efficient lifnga is the Viresvara (a name of Siva) lifiga. After having performed the ritual for thirteen months, Visvanara saw an eight year old boy whose body was smeared with ashes and tangled hair, manifest himself on the Vireivara linrga. Viivdnara understood that Siva had manifested himself in the form of a child and he praised him as the ultimate reality, as having all cosmic functions and as the fulfiller of all wishes and as being old, young and a child all at once. Siva in the form of a child guaranteed to fulfil the wish of Sucismati for a son and that he himself would be born as their son in the form of Grhapati, "Lord of the house." The praise that Visvdnara had sung, Siva said, is such that he who repeats it three times a day will get the wish of a son, a grandchild and riches fulfilled. Thereafter Siva in the form of the child manifestation was born as the son of Sucismati and Visvdnara. All kinds of auspicious events marked his birth: flowers fell from heaven, the water in all the rivers became crystal clear, and the air became free from dust, the wind carried pleasant fragrance and the animals also became filled with peace and calmness. All kinds of supernormal beings, sages and gods came to greet the child. The text describes the beautiful child and the pleasure of receiving a child: "Through a child a human being conquers the earth," and, "A house without a son is empty, both in this life and after death there is nothing better than a son, there is no greater happiness than a son, there is no greater friend than a son." One God poster (Figure 2) depicts Siva as a young boy and might be related to this story. Here the manifestation of Siva as a child is related to the liniga and the fertility aspect of Siva. One of the functions of the child manifestation is to give hope to the childless. Persons who wish for a son should therefore worship Siva as a liniga while they concentrate their thought on the child manifestation of Siva. The Vireivara liniga is still worshipped in Varanasi to fulfil the wish for a son.12 The only statues of Siva as a child have been found in Bengal dated from the 12 Cf. Eck 1982. Eck writes (358): "The 'Hero's Lord,' a self-manifest liriga in which Siva appeared to a young boy-hero, the foster child of the matrikas. Later, Siva appeared out of this lifnga as a young boy and granted the devout Viivdnara the</page><page sequence="8">244 Knut A. Jacobsen Figure 2. Siva as a young boy.</page><page sequence="9">The Child Manifestation of Siva in Hindu Popular Prints 245 eleventh century and later.13 These statues depicting Siva together with a goddess were connected to the belief that the worship of the child manifestation of Siva was able to cause the childless to receive a son. The statues should assist the believers to keep the image of Siva as child in their mind.'4 This is one of the most important functions of the child image of Siva. The child-god posters of Siva may similarly have functions connected to human fertility. One God poster (Figure 3) depicting Siva as child with the liriga seems to belong to this category. Another God poster depicting Siva and Parvati as children (Figure 4) might have the same function. Siva and Anasuyi The child manifestation of Siva as the fulfiller of the wish for a child is also associated with Anasuya, the famous mother of the god Dattitreya. In the Puranas it is described that Anasuyi and her husband Atri performed tapas to obtain a son and Brahma, Visnu and Siva, pleased with them, agreed to become their sons.15 They are born as Soma, Dattdtreya and Durvasas. In a well-known story the same three gods were going to test the chastity of Anastiya when her husband Atri was absent. They asked her to serve them food while naked. Anastiya then sprinkled water on them and transformed them into babies. Then she took off her clothes and started breastfeeding them. I have not yet found God posters of this episode, although an artist in Banaras gave me a photograph planned to become a poster in boon of a son, who became Vaigvdnara, also known as Agni. Known today as the Atmavireivara, this liniga is still worshipped for the boon of a son." 13 Trivedi 1967. 14 Such a cultic use of the God posters of Siva can be found in India today. In the temple of Vindhyavasini in Vindhyachal, I observed the poster of Siva as a child on the wall inside the temple. This temple is for the goddess as giver of fertility and riches. It is possible that the poster of Siva as child was put up to attract persons who performed rituals to get the wish for a son fulfilled. 15 DevT Bhdgavata Purdna 4.16.6-9; Siva Purdna, Satarudrasamhita 19.24-27; Skanda Purana 5.3.103.1-109.</page><page sequence="10">246 Knut A.

Siva Manifests Himself as a Child to Calm a Furious Goddess In several sacred narratives Siva transforms himself into a child to remove the manifestation of the destructive face of the Goddess. Several God posters illustrate this sacred narrative (Figures 6 and 7). According to one sacred narrative, Kali was called on to kill the demon Daruka who threatened the whole cosmos with destruction.16 The demon had received the boon that only a woman could kill him. First, Indra and the other gods, dressed as women, tried to kill him, but they were without success. They then went to Siva and asked him to go to the Goddess and try to convince her to take on the task of killing the demon. Pdrvati, accepting the task, then went into the body of Siva with a part of herself. From the poison which Siva always carries in his neck after the churning of the ocean (the reason he is called Nilakantha ["blue-necked"]), she made a new body. Siva thereafter created Kali from his third eye. Kali therefore has two parts, one part is from the benign goddess and one part is from Siva. The part she receives from Siva is the dangerous world destructive poison. After having seen Kali all the other gods became extremely frightened and ran away. Kali thereafter killed Daruka. The whole universe was shaken by the violence and fury of Kdli. Skanda Purdna says: On the cremation ground Avanti Kali cried several times. Because of this all the living beings of the whole world became dumb and paralysed as if they were dead. Thereafter Rudra took the form of a child to save the universe. Rudra approached her on the cremation ground while he cried. Kdlikd then became full of care, took the child on her lap and nursed him while she said, "Do not cry." In the disguise of a child being nursed, Siva consumed the anger that came from her body. (1.2.62.9-12) The same story is also found in the Litiga Purdna: Bhava became a child because of his magic power (mayd) and placed himself on the cremation ground that was full of corpses and ghosts. I~vara cried there as to 16 Liriga Purdna 1.106; Skanda Purdna 1.2.62.</page><page sequence="13">The Child Manifestation of Siva in Hindu Popular Prints 249 Figure 5. Siva as child on the lap of a goddess.</page><page sequence="14">250 Knut A. Jacobsen calm the fire in her mind. When the Goddess saw the child who was really isana, she was tricked by his creative power (mayd). She lifted him up, kissed him on his head and nursed him to her breast. (1.106.21-22) Siva transformed himself into a child to manifest the beneficial side of the goddess in order to save the world. Kili took Siva in her arms and started to nurse him and at that moment her fury disappeared. Siva took the destructive poison back to himself so that it again was under his control. After having given up the form of a child, he again appeared as who he really is, he showed himself in the eight forms, i.e. as the universe. These eight forms are the same forms that he received through getting names according to the previously mentioned story in the Sathapatha Brahmana. Refreshed by the milk of the goddess, Siva danced the tdndava dance in the twilight together with ghosts and other twilight beings.17 Siva danced in a fury surrounded by his flocks (ganas) to the sound of the drums that destroy the universe at the end of a cosmic cycle.18 The destructive power had again been transferred to Siva, but also Kali participated in the dance and the gods paid homage to her. The destructive power of Kali was now controlled. In the Skanda Purdna version, the other gods begged Siva not to abandon his form as a child because they were afraid that Kli again should become violent. They believed, correctly, that it was the presence of Siva as a child that turned KIll into a non-violent mother. But the child answered that the gods should not be afraid of Kali because she was now kind. Siva nevertheless created 64 boys whom he placed as protectors (ksetrapdlas) against the fury of Kall. The presence of these children in the world makes sure Kili manifests her benign side. In this sacred story, Siva transforms himself into a child so that the goddess hides her dangerous side and manifests her benign. Siva becomes a child so that the goddess can become motherly and he can retrieve the poison.19 In this story, the poison flows from Siva to his wife so that she can become fierce, and back again to Siva when her 17 Kramrisch 1981:411. 18 Basham 1954:310. 19 Kramrisch 1981:411.</page><page sequence="15">The Child Manifestation of Siva in Hindu Popular Prints 251 work is done so she again becomes benign. When Siva becomes her son, the Goddess becomes a benign mother and he can retrieve the poison. Thereafter Siva dances the destructive dance that expresses that the poison is again contained in his body. God poster Figure 6 depicts Siva as a child, as an adult swallowing poison, and Kdli, and refers to this sacred narrative. There are other variants of this story. In one version about the swallowing of poison the roles of Siva and the Goddess are reversed. After Siva had swallowed the poison, Kili knew that the only way to save him was for her to nurse him. She could not nurse him, however, since he was her husband. She therefore transformed herself into the goddess Tira and transformed Siva into a child and nursed him with her milk to save him. Some of the poison entered the breast and therefore women have a dark ring around the nipple, the story says.20 God poster Figure 7 might depict this narrative. In both of these stories the poison that came into being when the ocean was churned, is transferred between God and the Goddess. When the poison is transferred both parts are transformed. Siva Manifests Himself as a Child Who is Caught by a Crocodile According to the Brahma Purana's narration of the marriage of Siva and Parvati, Siva, making himself ready for the marriage, transforms himself into a child twice.21 After the arrangement of the "ceremony of selection of husband" (svayamrvara) had been agreed upon, Siva bade her farewell after first informing her that he thought her unattainable. Soon after she heard the cries of an unhappy child from the lake close to where she sat. Siva had taken the form of a child and had entered the lake to play, but once in the lake he had been attacked by a crocodile. The child asked the crocodile for mercy since he was the only child and his parents would kill themselves if he died. But the crocodile pulled the boy further and further ashore. PIrvati then asked the crocodile to let go of him. The crocodile, as a condition for freeing Siva, demanded 20 McDaniel 1989:89. 21 Brahma Purana (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass 1985), part 1, 183-201.</page><page sequence="16">252 Knut A.

Siva as child and the churning of the ocean.</page><page sequence="18">254 Knut A. Jacobsen that Parvati should give up all the religious merit she had won through her asceticism. This Parvati accepted because, the text says, to save a Brahmin is more important than her own religious merit. I have found no God poster to illustrate this episode. In one God poster (Figure 4) Siva and Parvati are both portrayed as children, but I am not aware of a Puranic story in which Siva manifests himself as a child for the child P~rvati. Siva Manifests Himself as a Child on Parvatf's Lap After Siva has played in the water with a crocodile, all the gods come to Parvati for her svayamvara.22 Before a svayamvara a woman announced that she would select a husband and males would come to display their powers and riches. During this ceremony Siva again takes the form of a child. The reason, the text tells us, is to test Parvati. Siva transforms himself into a child and goes to sleep on Parvati's lap. The contrast between this and what a man usually does in the svayamrvara is striking. Parvati, the text says, "saw the child lying in her lap and with the help of meditation she understood who he was and she become delighted. She received the man she wanted to choose." A mother marries a child. The gods get angry when they see a child lying in the lap of the goddess in what is supposed to be her svayamvara. They probably think they have been tricked. Indra then tries to kill the child. His hands, however, are paralysed and he is unable to throw his weapon. Brahma knows that the child is Siva and he pays homage to him: "You are the unborn lord, you never grow old. You are the creator. You are both purusa and prakrti. You create prakrti and transcend it. This woman (Pirvati) is prakrti who is your instrument in creation. She has taken the form of your wife and has come to you as the cause of the world." The sleeping child symbolises perhaps the passive purusa principle. "He is the unchanging purusa," Brahma says about him. The Goddess is the active principle and God is the passive witness. The 22 This part of the story is found also in Linga Purana 1.102.</page><page sequence="19">The Child Manifestation of Siva in Hindu Popular Prints 255 sleeping child is a symbol of the passive self, ultimate reality, while the mother symbolizes the creative principle.23 The theme of Siva as a child on the lap of Parvati is found also in the Mahabhdrata, Dronaparvan and Anusisanaparvan. After Siva had destroyed the city of Tripura, Parvati came to look at the burning of the city. While she overlooked the city, a boy suddenly appeared on her lap. The Goddess asked the gods who the boy was, but the gods instead of answering the question got violent and tried to kill the boy. As in the previous story, the hands of Indra were paralysed. This also happened to the other gods. They went to Brahma who said that Siva had become a child for the sake of Ptrvati. The gods then paid homage to him. Also in the story of Grhapati this theme is found. Viivanara and Sucismati are informed that their son might die from Indra's thunderbolt. When the boy was twelve, Indra became angry and threatened to kill the boy. The reason Indra gave for this was that the parents had worshipped Siva instead of himself. The boy became frightened but Siva said that the thunderbolt would not harm anyone who is devoted to Siva. The rivalry between Siva and Indra is a topic well known in the Hindu mythology. I have not found a poster illustrating this theme, may be because the rivalry between Siva and Indra is of little concern to contemporary Hinduism. Themes Some episodes of the sacred narratives of Siva as a child have already been depicted in the God posters, and more episodes will probably be depicted in the future. Various themes are encountered in the narratives. Several God posters illustrate Siva's connection to fertility. A common theme in the sacred narratives is that Siva becomes a child so that Ptrvati or other women can become mothers. One of the ritual contexts is that Siva becomes a child so that women who perform paja to him can become mothers. Siva as the liniga is connected to fertility and Siva's rivalry with Indra has also to do with this aspect. 23 See Jacobsen 1999. In Mandakya Upanisad dreamless sleep is seen as the state closest to atman.</page><page sequence="20">256 Knut A. Jacobsen Siva as child exemplifies the principle of divine play, ltliM.24 He transforms himself into a child to play in the lake or to make fun of the other gods. The child is specially suitable to symbolise the principle of lil. God does not act because of duty to preserve the world (dharma), nor are his acts necessary consequences of previous acts (karma), nor does God act because of desire (kdma). God acts in spontaneous freedom (svatantra). Siva as a child might illustrate this freedom of the divine. God poster Figure 8, depicting sleeping Siva as a child, might be related to this theme, the child Siva lying down to rest after having played. Even if several episodes from the narratives of Siva as child are depicted in the posters, Siva in the narratives appears different from Siva in the God posters. Siva as child in the posters looks sweet and innocent like Krsna as child. Siva as child in Figures 1 and 3 seems to convey a vision of Siva inspired perhaps by the playful innocence depicted in the God posters of Krsna as child. Siva as a child in the narratives, however, does not radiate the innocence of paradise, as child-gods often do. Siva in several of the narratives is associated with the destructive side of the divine and has a difficult relationship to his wife/mother. Siva as a child is connected to poison and destruction as well. Even as a child Siva is involved in balancing the amount of poison in the world, i.e. to control the destructive forces. Several God posters illustrate this theme. Siva carries the end of the world within himself. Kerenyi, in a classical comparative study of the child-god (Jung and Kerenyi 1971), writes that the child-god often is related to the sun and the sunrise and the beginning, when creation was new and fresh. This is not valid with respect to Siva, although he is related in some sacred narratives to the sun, but in the sense of its destructive burning heat. Siva as a child is connected to the moon. The twilight and the night are his favourite times of the day, and he is connected to the end-time, not 24 An alternative to the understanding of the world as illusion (mdyd) or emptiness (iiinyatd) in South Asian religions is the understanding of the world as lIId, play. According to this view the world is full of God. The world is then a real manifestation of God and is interpreted as a result of his play.</page><page sequence="21">The Child Manifestation of Siva in Hindu Popular Prints 257 rd ?re rC O \VI) b~3 C a d) d) od</page><page sequence="22">258 Knut A. Jacobsen the beginning. Siva's lTli is exemplified by the tandava dance in which he dances at the cremation ground. Even in his Klla he remains the God of destruction.25 Siva's childhood is in the same way as the liniga-yoni and ard- handri-vara, a form of God in union with the Goddess. He constitutes the male half of the unity of the male and the female when he sits on the lap of the goddess. When Siva transforms himself from man to a child the woman in the relationship is transformed from wife to mother. The mother goddess in Hinduism is ambivalent, she has two principal sides: destructive and creative.26 The child gives rise to her creative as- pect and hides her destructive aspect. By Siva being transformed into a child, the destructive Kali becomes transformed into a creative mother. She becomes Tara or Pdrvati. Siva's weeping causes Kali to manifest her motherly affectionate side and then she is no longer dangerous. Several God posters of Siva as child illustrate this theme. The central theme in the myths about Kali and Siva is that Kali threatens to de- stroy the world but Siva saves the world from destruction by taming her. The most common way for this to happen is for Siva to lie down on the ground. When Kali recognises him as her husband she becomes calm. Siva becoming a child is a variation on this theme. The mother has two sides, the destructive and the creative. Siva as a child reveals 25 Krsna, the most well known child manifestation, and Siva exhibit quite different aspects of Ifla. Krsna points to the spontaneous freedom of God, that God is above the rules of society, a world without duties in which God is totally absorbed in his own play without any thought for anything else. He expresses the innocence of childhood. The child is free from ritual duties and is not yet incorporated into society. Krsna steals and lies, not because he is evil, but because he is the master of 1I&amp;1, divine play. He is God beyond dharma. He belongs to a world without moral or social conventions. As a youth he continues the play, now with the women of Vrndavana. Krsna's childhood has been understood as a picture of the bliss of paradise. The child Krsna, according to David Kinsley, sends a message about the spontaneity and freedom of God, and he radiates "a transcendent aloofness from the world that arises from God's utter self- absorption and self-delight" (Kinsley 1975:18). 26 Berkson 1995.</page><page sequence="23">The Child Manifestation of Siva in Hindu Popular Prints 259 the creative side and hides the destructive one.27 The adult Siva lies down on the ground and when Kali sits or stands on him her destruc- tive aspect is hidden by means of her union with the male. As a child Siva lies down on the ground and weeps so that Kali hides her terrible side and manifests her benign side. Siva as a child causes the benign side of the Goddess to become manifest. 27 Theorisations inspired from Freud and Jung around mother and child, even if they are not directly connected to Siva, can perhaps have some value to bring forth some aspects of this mythology. This type of theorising will be interested in a man who is transformed into his wife's weeping child and who is nursed by her. According to Jung, inspired by thinkers such as Erich Neumann and Heinrich Zimmer, a strong independent ego is the goal of the psychic process. The strongest hindrance for this development is a mother who denies her son freedom and independence. The archetype that expresses this aspect of the development, they thought, was the great mother with a weak youth. She shows herself sometimes as terrible and in this way kills the ego. But precisely her repulsive side gives the ego an opportunity for freedom. The Goddess, according to Zimmer, represents a regression to childhood and absence of individuality, and a rejection of values such as individual effort (cf. Kinsley 1975:130). Carmel Berkson (1995), another interpreter of myths who works within this paradigm, building on Freud, Jung and Campbell, has given a Freudian interpretation of Durga. She interprets the demon fighting Durgd as the son who attempts to fight for freedom from the dominant mother. But when the son attempts to fight, the mother becomes furious and unable of being conquered. If the son again becomes a child and sits on her lap, she becomes the kind mother. I do not want to commit myself to the kind of metaphysics this kind of theorising presupposes, but clearly the transformation of Siva from adult to child and the simultaneous transformation of the Goddess from terrible to beneficent, has interesting implications. Many of the sacred narratives about Siva as a child conform to the pattern of these theories. Siva who lies down on the cremation ground to calm down the terrible Kdli, a woman made of a part of his wife, exemplify these events. The crocodile that pulls Siva into the water of the lake (the undifferentiated origin of creation) makes Parvati give away all the religious merit earned from her asceticism, which belongs to the destructive aspect of the goddess, to become a mother. Siva returns to his source because water is a female principle of creation in Hinduism. Siva is then suddenly born by appearing on the lap of Parvati in the svayamvara ceremony. The goddess was going to witness the presentation of the suitors' powers, but instead became a mother who was to marry a child sleeping on her lap.</page><page sequence="24">260 Knut A. Jacobsen Siva represents the coming together of opposites and alternates between destruction and creation. Parvati is also involved in these alternations. She performs asceticism to get Siva interested in her in order to give birth to a son, Skanda, that is, in order to become creative. The poison that flows between Siva and Kali, the subject of several God posters, illustrates how the destructive and creative forces move between them. Siva carries the poison that would have caused an untimely world dissolution if no-one had offered to carry it. It gets transferred to Parvati as a manifestation of Kali. Parvati plus poison becomes Kali. In order to calm Kali, Siva needs to get the poison back. The poison and Parvati need to be separated for the world to be preserved. Siva transforms himself into a child and Kali because of this becomes benign. Then Siva can take back the poison from her breast. The poison is a side product of the churning of the ocean and is necessarily present on the earth. It can't disappear although it can move between the God and the Goddess. Someone has to carry the poison to preserve the earth. Siva saves the world by taking the poison back into his body. He thereby causes the Goddess to become benign. But in another version of the myth the Goddess had to intervene to save Siva by giving him breast milk as the antidote to the poison of the world. This shows that the God and the Goddess clearly form a unity, as shown in Figures 6 and 7. Conclusion The God posters of Siva as a child are not the result only of the creativity of contemporary artists. Even if Siva's child manifestations are seldom mentioned in the academic accounts of the mythology of Siva, narratives of these manifestations are nevertheless found in some of the sacred texts. The textual references and technical interpretations of these narratives given in this article are probably unknown to most Hindus and the success of the God posters of Siva as a child is not due, probably, to the theological meaning of his manifestation. The recent appearance of the child images of Siva in the God posters is probably due to the general popularity of the child-god posters. Not only baby Siva, but Krsna, Ganega, Rama, Murugan, Hanuman and</page><page sequence="25">The Child Manifestation of Siva in Hindu Popular Prints 261 others are being pictured as babies in the God posters. The avataras of Siva in the Puranas were probably created as imitations of the avataras of Visnu in an effort to counter the popularity especially of Krsna and Rama. However, the Siva avataras never became popular like the Visnu avataras. The emergence of Siva as a child in the popular prints the last fifteen years might be a response to the success of the prints of the child Krsna. That the child manifestation of Siva has now become part of the Hindu iconography is related therefore to the commercial success and interests of the God poster industry. The new medium has provided new opportunities. The good reception of the child god posters in general might mirror sociological changes in contemporary India. The popularity of the child gods might reflect the rapid urbanisation (one third of India's population now live in cities), increasing economic prosperity, better availability of health services and the growth of the middle class and the television culture. When people move from villages to cities their conceptions of the divine change. When gods and goddesses move from villages to cities their ferocity is often replaced by benevolence and kindness.28 The iconographic representations of the divinities in the cities in general often appear gentle and benign. Urbanisation also shifts focus from the welfare of the village to the welfare of the family, and especially one's own children. Child gods represent family values. Today, it seems, the child gods express urban, middle class and family values. The child gods often symbolise innocence and purity. The child is a god without anger, he usually does not punish. One approaches him therefore without fear. The child god is a god one approaches with parental love. He represents the innocence of paradise and this aspect of the divine transcendence. The child god is perhaps well suited to attract the urban middle class in a period of economic growth and increased security. The narratives of Siva as child do not support this interpretation, but his appearance as an innocent child in the god posters does. Most Hindus are probably ignorant of many 28 See Padma 2001 for a discussion of this phenomenon with respect to Hindu goddesses.</page><page sequence="26">262 Knut A. Jacobsen of the narratives of Siva as child. The god posters of Siva as a child owe their success, probably, not to the theological meaning of Siva's child manifestation as revealed in the narratives, but to the quality and motives of the posters themselves and, perhaps, to the attractiveness of child gods in general. New themes from the mythology are continuously being represented in the God posters, also themes that were never represented icono- graphically before. My purpose in this article has been to show that even if the depictions of the child manifestations of Siva in the God posters represent an iconographical innovation, these God posters rely on the presence of the child manifestation of Siva in the sacred texts of the Hindu tradition. While only some of the episodes of Siva as a child till now have been depicted in the God posters, it is not unreasonable to expect that more episodes involving the manifestation of Siva as a child will be depicted in God posters in the future.
