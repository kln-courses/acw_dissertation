<plain_text><page sequence="1">HISTORICAL CONTINGENCY AND THE PREHISTORIC FOUNDATIONS OF MOIETY ORGANIZATION AMONG THE EASTERN PUEBLOS Severin M. Fowles 8 Walters Crescent, The Mumbles, Swansea, Wales, UK SA3 4BB Past discussions of Eastern Pueblo moiety organization in the American Southwest have been dominated by structural-functionalist positions and have proposed that moieties emerged in this area in order to facilitate the social integration of large, aggregated villages. This paper revisits the question of moiety origins from an archaeological perspective, presenting new data from the ancestral Northern Tiwa region that document the presence of a dual division as early as the late thirteenth century at the large village of T'ait6na (Pot Creek Pueblo). Consideration of the village's position within the local historical trajectory suggests that moieties were initially established there as a means offormalizing the social relationships between a local population and a recently arrived group of immigrants. The paper ends by arguing that these sorts of specific historical phenomena must be granted greater causal significance in the explanation of Eastern Pueblo moiety origins. THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE HISTORIC PUEBLOS of the American Southwest is classically understood as varying along a west-to-east gradient with matrilineal clan systems dominant among the Hopi and Zufii pueblos in the west and ceremonial moiety systems dominant among the Tanoan pueblos of the east (Eggan 1950; Fox 1967; Parsons 1924). In the present paper, I am concerned with the latter systems and their prehistoric origins. Several ethnographers have considered this issue, most speculating that the Eastern Pueblo moieties emerged as an organizational adaptation to cope with either the major community dislocations of the post-Chacoan era, the resulting increase in the population density of the Rio Grande Valley, the adoption of irrigation techniques, or some other such variable (e.g., Dozier 1970; Eggan 1950:315-17; Hawley 1937; Wittfogel and Goldfrank 1943). All of these hypotheses, however, have been difficult to evaluate owing to a lack of research specifically designed to examine the emergence and development of moiety or dual division patterning in the archaeological record. I seek to rectify this situation here by considering in detail the case of prehistoric moiety formation in one portion of the Eastern Pueblo world to see what light can be shed on the process within the region as a whole. The area of particular interest-the ancestral Northern Tiwa territory or Taos district, as it is known archaeologically (Figure 1)-will no doubt be regarded as an unlikely choice for Journal of Anthropological Research, vol. 61, 2005 Copyright ? by The University of New Mexico 25</page><page sequence="2">26 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH those familiar with the existing ethnographic literature on the Eastern Pueblos. Indeed, the two Northern Tiwa pueblos, Taos and Picuris, have traditionally been viewed as exhibiting relatively weak moiety organization during historic times, and it is typically assumed that the same was true in prehistory. In the discussion that follows, however, I report on new archaeological data suggesting that the antiquity of moiety organization in the Northern Tiwa region is much more substantial than previously thought. A number of lines of evidence now indicate that dualism emerged as a dominant principle in the social organization and ritual life of the ancestral Northern Tiwa by the dawn of the fourteenth century, and I argue that these patterns represent the local emergence of a moiety system that was genealogically related to those of historic Taos and Picur's. Explaining why this system-which may have been among the first in the Rio Grande Valley- emerged when and where it did demands that we pay close attention to the complicated sequence of immigration and ethnic conflict that directly preceded it, a task that is undertaken in the second half of the paper.

A counterpoint also runs through the discussion, however, that has to do with the more general problem regarding the relative explanatory weight given to structural-functionalist versus historical approaches in archaeological analyses of social organization. There has been a tendency in much Southwestern archaeology to treat patterns such as moiety divisions as structures that "naturally" arose to meet existing organizational challenges, group solutions that were cut of whole cloth and that necessarily functioned to enhance community cohesion and integration. However, it almost goes without saying that every social organization is the result of an ongoing negotiation between individuals and subgroups with partially competing agendas, pieced together using the strategies and social categories that history has made available (McGuire 1992:251). All social structures, in other words, are historically contingent to some degree and must be analyzed as such. As we will see, the case of moiety formation among the Northern Tiwa highlights this larger point and reminds us of the degree to which structural-functionalist analyses are limited in their ability to explain social change. CEREMONIAL MOIETIES OF THE EASTERN PUEBLOS As an anthropological concept, "moiety" was originally introduced in 1920 by Lowie (1961:118), who used the term in reference to tribes that were socially partitioned into halves or dual divisions. While Lowie was particularly concerned with exogamous moieties that functioned as large clans (or sibs, in the terminology of the day), he also acknowledged that moieties need not be related to marriage regulation or kinship at all (1961:132-33). The latter sorts of dual divisions were what Leslie White (1959:159) later referred to as the "social function" type of moiety to indicate that they regulated aspects of society other than marriage. White also referred to such divisions as "ritual" moieties because it was very often the case that their primary significance was to the ceremonial organization of a community. The moieties of the historic Eastern Pueblos were of this latter, "ritual" type. While in most cases moiety affiliation was based on patrilineal inheritance, in practice membership was relatively flexible. Women, for example, frequently joined the moiety of their husbands (if they were not already of the same moiety), and children were occasionally recruited into their mother's birth moiety for specific religiopolitical reasons (e.g., Ortiz 1969:44). Rather than as a means of organizing kin relations, Eastern Pueblo moieties were much more important as structuring principles in community ritual and leadership. The moieties of each village operated as complementary and relatively interdependent ceremonial institutions that assumed control of different aspects of the ritual sphere and alternated community leadership positions on seasonal and, in some cases, yearly bases. As we will see below, dualism more broadly was also a fundamental element in the symbolism and cosmology of many Eastern Pueblo villages. Since the early days of anthropological interest in the subject, the Tewa villages in the vicinity of modern-day Santa Fe and Espahiola have been considered to provide the "purest" or most elaborate examples of moiety organization. Ortiz's</page><page sequence="4">28 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH (1969) classic study of the Tewa at San Juan Pueblo described the social and symbolic complexity of this system in extraordinary detail, and it is largely through his work that modem scholars have come to understand moiety organization in the Eastern Pueblos generally. Indeed, the presence of less-pronounced moiety systems among neighboring peoples such as the Tiwa or Keres is frequently regarded as an artifact of the incomplete diffusion of the system out of its Tewa heartland (e.g., Eggan 1950:315; Ware and Blinman 2000:397). Below, I take issue with this position somewhat. For the moment, however, let me merely note that we have much to learn about the Eastern Pueblo moieties by considering the development of these supposedly "secondary" systems among the Tewa's neighbors. In what follows, therefore, my interest is with the Northern Tiwa- speaking pueblos, Taos and Picurfs, and with the process by which moieties emerged among their prehistoric predecessors. Compared with those of the Tewa, the historic moiety systems of the Northern Tiwa are less well known. Parsons's (1936, 1939) brief descriptions of the two pueblos and Stevenson's (n.d.) notes from her ethnographic work at Taos during 1906 and 1910 are the primary sources relevant to the subject, and neither source approaches the level of synthesis achieved in Tewa ethnography. Furthermore, both Parsons's and Stevenson's work suggests that the Northern Tiwa moieties of the early twentieth century were less elaborate than those of the Tewa. Nevertheless, it is also clear that dualism was conspicuous in many aspects of Northern Tiwa socioceremonial organization and symbolism, and it will be useful to establish a few of these aspects as a preface to the subsequent discussion of ancestral Northern Tiwa moieties in the next section. At both Taos and Picuris, moiety organization was expressed as a matter of north versus south,' and this directional quality may be taken as a first principle underlying Northern Tiwa dualism at both a conceptual and a material level. Taos was and is, for example, famously divided by a river that flows through the open plaza with named architectural complexes on either side--Hlauuma or "North House" and Hlaukwima or "South House" (Figure 2). There are no existing native reports that residence within these architectural divisions had an explicit connection with the moiety system itself. Historically, at least, moiety affiliation was instead determined by one's kiva membership, and it was the position of these kivas in either the northside or southside group that was significant (Parsons 1936; Stevenson n.d.). In this way, the Taos moiety system was similar to that at Picurfs Pueblo where ceremonial membership in either the huota (Northside People) or the hukwita (Southside People) was required and patrilineally inherited but was not correlated with household location (Brown 1973:97, 1979:273). At Taos, moiety organization was also expressed in at least two other immediately visible social contexts. In the realm of leadership, the division was reproduced through the existence of two socioreligious positions, each of which was associated with a different moiety or kiva cluster. The Big Earring Man of the north group and the Cacique (and/or Water Man) of the south group were the two principal leaders of the community (Parsons 1936; Stevenson n.d.: File 3.1), and it was through these positions that a degree of balance in the distribution of social</page><page sequence="5">MOIETY ORGANIZATION AMONG THE EASTERN PUEBLOS 29 TT /1 Hlauuma i i (North House) Hlaukwima ( / O = 1 story O = 2 story = 3 story 0 50 m Figure 2.

In a more tangible sense-at least for the outsider visiting Taos or Picurfs Pueblo-the moiety system was also evident in the annual relay races in which north ran against south (see Brown 1973:98). These were community-wide events in the sense that all Pueblo members participated either by running, officiating, or actively encouraging the runners along. While the races were far from adversarial (both sides had the common goal of helping the sun in its course across the sky through the ritual [Parsons 1936:96]), they were a highly visible context in which moiety affiliation was crystallized. Taos oral traditions and historic ceremonial patterns reveal that each moiety clearly had seasonal associations as well-southside with summer and northside with winter-that provided a basis for the alternation of leadership over the course</page><page sequence="6">30 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH of a yearly cycle. As among the Tewa, for example, the Taos origin story recorded by Stevenson (n.d.: File 2.19) primarily documents the migrations of and interactions between the Summer People and the Winter (or Ice) People, who are viewed as having joined forces in the past to form the core of the Taos community. Although various other named Peoples were incorporated into this core group, the Summer and Winter People continued to be viewed as comprising the major membership of the historic kivas in the southside and northside groups, respectively. Careful reading of Parsons's (1936) compiled ceremonial calendar further reveals that the ritual obligations of the Cacique or Water Man (southside) were predominantly in the summer, while those of the Big Earring Man (northside) were predominantly in the winter. Of related interest is the fact that both moieties were in possession of an anthropomorphic stone fetish-the White Mountain Society owning one for the northside and the Old Axe Kiva owning one for the southside (Parsons 1936:75, 77). Appropriately, the northside fetish was referred to as "White Mountain" and thus may be considered to have winter associations, while the southside fetish was referred to as "Summer Eagle-tail" with an obvious summer connotation. The indigenous significance of the moiety division extended further still. The southside or Summer moiety was symbolically associated with agriculture whereas the northside or Winter moiety was associated with hunting (Stevenson n.d.: passim), in keeping with similar trends throughout the Pueblo world. Fenton (1957:316; see also Beals and Siegel 1966:144; Ellis 1974:49) also reported that the north/south division had gender connotations, the north kivas having been conceptually coded as "male" and the south kivas "female" (cf. Tewa gender/ spatial symbolism in Ortiz 1979:285). Data regarding inter-moiety relay racing collected by Parsons (1996:986) further suggest that the northside and southside moieties were associated with "Sun" and "Moon," respectively. Additional expressions of dualism among the historic Northern Tiwa might be explored; but the important point, I hope, has already been made: moiety organization-and dualism in general-suffused much of Taos ceremonial life. Having just argued for the importance of this dual system, it must be acknowledged that the Taos "moieties" do not appear to have had any formal indigenous names (contrary to the situation at Picuris). At least, no such names have ever been recorded by ethnologists at the pueblo beyond those referring more specifically to the architectural halves of the village (see Parsons 1936:77, n. 38). Nor is there any explicit mention in the origin story regarding the development of the moiety system, a curious situation given the prominence of moieties in the mythology of the neighboring Tewa with whom the Northern Tiwa clearly shared a variety of cultural characteristics. The question therefore arises as to whether the relatively extensive patterns of dualism at historic Taos Pueblo resulted from the borrowing of partial elements of the moiety system from the Tewa (as most scholars have accepted) or whether the patterns have some deeper and more substantial basis in Northern Tiwa prehistory itself. This question can only be meaningfully addressed using archaeological data, and it is to these that we now turn.</page><page sequence="7">MOIETY ORGANIZATION AMONG THE EASTERN PUEBLOS 31 THE ANTIQUITY OF DUAL ORGANIZATION AMONG THE PREHISTORIC NORTHERN TIWA Existing evidence suggests that the ancestral Northern Tiwa have continuously occupied the Taos district of northern New Mexico for just over a millennium. While extensive and little-studied Archaic sites document a much deeper human presence, the first pueblo-style settlements appeared relatively abruptly in the district sometime during the tenth century AD. These initial settlements took the form of semi- or fully subterranean pithouses and small unit pueblos that were already part of a mature architectural tradition; as such, they probably represent the immigration of Pueblo groups from the west rather than a truly local development out of a Late Archaic population base. Recent efforts to develop a district-wide ceramic seriation (Fowles 2004a: App. C) suggest that a second major wave of immigration occurred at the end of the twelfth century following the breakup of the Chacoan system in the San Juan Basin. At this time, the unpainted ceramics of the Taos district underwent a punctuated change-notably, surface decoration switched from incised designs to smeared indented corrugation texturing, and overall vessel morphology changed from more conical to globular bases and from direct to flared rims. Local architecture also rapidly changed from a preponderance of dispersed pithouses to the exclusive use of unit pueblos. Analyses of survey data further suggest that population levels in the district markedly increased during the early thirteenth century (Fowles 2004a: App. D), probably as a direct result of groups from the south and/or west contributing their numbers to the growing local communities. I will return to this sequence of immigration and population mixing below. For the moment, however, let us focus instead on the events that took place during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries on the heels of these demographic changes. In the chronological sequence of the northern Rio Grande, this period comprises the latter half of the "Coalition period" (AD 1150-1325), an aptly named block of time during which communities throughout the region were actively coalescing into relatively large village complexes (Crown et al. 1996; Fowles 2004b; Snead et al. 2004). The ancestral Northern Tiwa developed in step with these regional trends, for by the late thirteenth century the entire populace of the Taos district appears to have resided in three principal centers. One of these centers-Cornfield Taos-is almost completely unknown from an archaeological perspective (see Ellis and Brody 1964). A second-the early component of Picurfs Pueblo-has been partially excavated, but much of its patterning was heavily altered as a result of continued reuse and rebuilding during the subsequent Classic and Historical periods (see Dick et al. 1999). Our understanding of late Coalition period villages in the Taos district must therefore depend upon the third village- T'aitina (Pot Creek Pueblo) (Figure 3)-of which a great deal is known as a result of archaeological excavations that have been ongoing at the site throughout much of the past half century (Adler 1995; Crown 1991; Fowles 2004a; Wetherington 1968; Woosley 1980).</page><page sequence="8">32 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Roomblock 8 4 / magnetic north 2003 Roomblock 7 Room Roomblock 5 Roomblock 10 R = d Roomblock 6 Roomblock 3 ". i -m Roomblock 2 Figure 3. Map of prehistoric T'ait6na (Dashed lines indicate probable walls.) An extensive database of tree-ring dates documents that the occupation of T'aitina was relatively brief (Crown 1991; Crown and Kohler 1994). Most of the surface architecture at the site was constructed after AD 1260, and the village as a whole was abandoned in 1319 or shortly thereafter. This brevity of occupation empowers archaeological interpretation for it means that much of the patterning in material remains was only minimally affected by prehistoric processes of reuse at the site. Here, then, is an appropriate context in which to consider whether or not the moiety system of the historic Northern Tiwa had roots that extended back in time as far as the early fourteenth century. The challenge thus becomes a methodological one: How would we expect such a system to have been physically marked in prehistory?</page><page sequence="9">MOIETY ORGANIZATION AMONG THE EASTERN PUEBLOS 33 The Architectural Signature of Dualism Past efforts to identify moieties in prehistoric Pueblo contexts have uniformly found architectural patterns to be most revealing, the assumption being either that moiety organization necessitated duplicates of things such as residential zones and meeting places or that architecture was used as a fundamental medium for expressing dual symbolism (Clemen 1976:127-28; Fritz 1978; Hill 1970:36; Lowell 1996; Rohn 1971:39-40; Vivian 1970:80-82). With respect to the Northern Tiwa tradition itself, recall that an architectural division between north and south kiva groups has been one of the most dramatic materializations of moiety organization at Taos Pueblo historically. Had a genealogically related system been present during the Coalition period, we might expect to find a similar division at T'aitina. It is of considerable interest, therefore, that the architectural layout of the earliest component at T'aitina followed a roughly bipartite structure that physically divided the community into recognizable northern and southern halves. The map of the site's total architecture only suggests this division in a somewhat confused manner owing predominantly to the effects of additional construction during the second half of the site's occupation. Tree-ring data instead suggest, however, that the initial village took the form of a tight cluster of five discrete "unit pueblo-like" roomblocks, each with its own partially enclosed plaza and associated subterranean kiva (Figure 4). And when we consider only this early component of the site, a dual north/south pattern emerges much more starkly. Simply stated, each of the southern roomblocks is C- or U-shaped, whereas the two northern roomblocks are L-shaped. The close morphological similarities of the roomblocks within each half of the site in contrast to those of the opposing half might be viewed as sufficient evidence that some sort of meaningful social division between north and south groups--one that was ancestral to the historic Northern Tiwa moieties- also governed the initial layout of T'aitona. Let us consider these differences in somewhat greater detail, however. The north-south division of the early roomblocks at T'ait6na can be identified not only in their broad morphological patterns, but also in the specific architectural orientations of the two roomblock groups. Those of the northern group faced due east while those of the southern group faced southeast.2 At first glance, this difference might seem a minor one. Here, however, it is critical to note that earlier architecture in the region unwaveringly faced southeast. Following Northern Tiwa ethnography, the prominence of a southeastern orientation in the pre-T'aitdna architecture of the Taos district is best explained as the result of a ritual focus on the point on the horizon at which the sun rises at the December solstice (Fowles 2004a:276-80). Indeed, both Taos and Picuris consider the sun to be in its weakest state at the December solstice-thus the brevity of its time in the sky-and in need of the greatest assistance via human ritual observance. Historically, at least, much of the community's prayer was designed to bring back the warmth and productivity of summer following the trials of winter. In this sense, a significant portion of their ritual life was "oriented" toward the December solstice, and it comes as little surprise that most prehistoric architecture was similarly oriented as a means of</page><page sequence="10">34 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH June solstice sunrise position OP . = Early component S-construction magnetic north C = Late component 2003 construction December solstice sunrise position Figure 4. Comparison of northside and southside roomblocks at T'aitina reinforcing this point. The question then becomes why the builders of the northern roomblocks at T'aitina broke with long-standing tradition and instead aligned their structures due east. If we accept that the southern roomblocks at T'ait6na purposively faced the December solstice, then it is probably no coincidence that by facing due east the northern roomblocks were effectively oriented toward the sunrise location at the June solstice. Indeed, we know from Taos ethnography that while the December solstice was an especially important ritual period, the June solstice was also an occasion for major ceremonial observance (Ellis 1974:140). Given such a cultural</page><page sequence="11">MOIETY ORGANIZATION AMONG THE EASTERN PUEBLOS 35 backdrop as well as the widely noted Pueblo inclination to imbue architectural details with religious significance, it is reasonable to suppose (1) that each half of T'aitona was purposively aligned on one of the two solstice sunrise locations and (2) that this reflected the two major nodes on the community's ritual calendar. Recalling that the moiety system at historic Taos Pueblo also involved a seasonal division between summer and winter, we might draw the further conclusion that these architectural patterns were related to symbolic seasonal differences between the two roomblock groups: north with winter and south with summer.3 It is plausible, then, that during the Coalition period T'aitina was not only divided into north and south, but also into winter and summer. One final architectural pattern deserves our attention. While the bulk of both roomblock groups was composed of lower-story storage rooms, upper-story living rooms, plazas, and central kivas, a small number of formal grinding facilities were also present at T'aitona. Two large mealing bin rooms as well as two smaller rooms with limited numbers of bins have been excavated, all of which were located in the site's three southern roomblocks (Figure 3). The nearly complete excavation of Roomblocks 4 and 5 and recent testing in Roomblocks 7, 8, and 9, in contrast, failed to locate any comparable rooms (Fowles 2004a). In short, while excavation coverage is somewhat biased toward the southern half of the site, sufficient evidence exists to conclude that specialized grinding facilities are either absent or at least much smaller in the northern half of the site. T'aitina's southern roomblocks, then, appear to have been uniquely viewed as the culturally appropriate location for assembly-line corn processing. Is it therefore possible that a more general symbolic association between the south and agriculture was also present, one that mirrored the patterns of symbolism among the historic Northern Tiwa? This seems likely. Using architectural evidence alone, we have no means of explicitly testing whether or not the complementary symbolic association between north and hunting was present at the village level (but see below). However, one part of the puzzle is better then none at all. Taken together, these data suggest that dual patterning was already present by the late thirteenth century among the ancestral Northern Tiwa. Furthermore, they suggest that the critical divisions between north/south, winter/summer, and hunting/agriculture--divisions that were fundamental to the historic moiety system at Taos Pueblo-had already emerged as symbolic oppositions used to organize the village as a whole. Ritual Kiva Offerings and Dual Symbolism The village-wide patterning in T'ait6na's architecture goes a long way toward establishing that a dual division of some sort was present by the start of the fourteenth century. Let us now consider, as a second line of evidence, the manner in which dualism manifested at a much more intimate level within the boundaries of a single kiva. The ritual architecture of T' aitana was dominated by small, subterranean kivas of the sort that had been common throughout the northern Rio Grande since the start of the Coalition period. At least one semi-subterranean Great Kiva was also</page><page sequence="12">36 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH present at the site, although excavation (Wetherington 1968) and the subsequent dating of tree-ring samples from the fill (Crown 1991) have strongly suggested that the Great Kiva remained in an unfinished state when the village as a whole was abandoned. Until recently, it was assumed that a third type of ritual facility, commonly referred to as a D-shaped kiva, was absent from the ancestral Northern Tiwa tradition, despite the widespread distribution of such kivas throughout the neighboring Tewa area during the late Coalition period (Carlson and Kohler 1990:9; Hubbell and Traylor 1982; Steen 1977:11). Recent excavations, however, have revealed that at least one D-shaped surface kiva was also constructed at T'aitona (Fowles 2004a). The kiva in question (Room 822) was attached to Roomblock 8 (Figure 5), and while attempts at both tree-ring and archaeomagnetic dating proved unsuccessful, stratigraphic evidence suggests that the kiva was constructed, briefly used, and then decommissioned sometime during the early or middle portion of the site's occupation. Here, we will only be concerned with the events surrounding the abandonment of the structure and in particular with the objects deposited as offerings on the kiva floor. As a number of researchers have observed (Walker et al. 2000; Wilshusen 1986), the "abandonment" or formal closure of kivas throughout the prehistoric Pueblo world tended to occasion very specific ritual activities. Floor or wall features within a kiva such as sipapus or ventilator openings might be filled with sand or plastered over; special offerings might be deposited on the floor; and kiva roofs often were formally collapsed via either the intentional burning or the partial dismantling of the roof. Whether this represented an effort to desanctify an old ritual space so that another could be established elsewhere, to protect a former place of worship or connection with the spirit world from potential future interlopers, or to achieve some other desired end is unclear. Be that as it may, there can be little doubt that the closure of a kiva was a carefully orchestrated affair. A particularly large amount of ceremony surrounded the closure of the D- shaped kiva at T'ait6na. The ventilator was plugged with rocks and a deer antler was wedged into its interior opening. The main vigas of the room were removed, and the roof was forcibly collapsed. Prior to the latter event, however, a large number of objects were carefully laid out on the floor, the most dramatic of which were the remains of a 1.5-year-old human infant that had been placed immediately north of the ashpit. The infant had been decapitated and his or her head was not present within the room; however, the formality of the burial and its overlying slab stones clearly indicated that more than simple violence was involved. A more detailed interpretation of the burial has been offered elsewhere (Fowles 2004a:605-7); for the moment let us focus simply upon the distribution of additional objects that were placed alongside the infant. Almost all of the other objects on the floor were found surrounding the child in the eastern half of the room, and it is especially interesting that, within this eastern half, the floor objects can be divided into two groups: those with animal or hunting associations located to the north, and those with plant or agriculture associations located to the south. In the northeastern quadrant, for example, were a variety of faunal remains, including: (1) the articulated bones of a five-month-old</page><page sequence="13">MOIETY ORGANIZATION AMONG THE EASTERN PUEBLOS 37 A = Decapitated infant burial F = Fragmentary remains of two newly B = Portions of a mature deer antler born dogs and an immature deer forelimb G = Bird cranium (as yet unidentified) C = Bison 3rd phalange H = Deer/elk antler in ventilator opening D = Partial beaver cranium E = Dog burial (disturbed by later intrusive pit) SF North G WAnimal Hunting Hearth e - - H complex L South Plant SK Agriculture 0 2m I = Yucca matting L = Fused corn cobs and husks J = Fibrolite axe M = Fire-hardened digging stick tip K = Piflon pine cone scales (dotted N = Intact Taos Plain jar (overturned line indicates densest concen- and covering two corn cobs and tration) a pine cone) Figure 5. Map of the abandonment offerings on the floor of Room 822, a D-shaped kiva at T'aitina dog that had been partially disturbed by a later, intrusive pit; (2) the fragmentary and largely disarticulated remains of two very young canids under three months old; (3) a cluster of deer remains, including the articulated lower front forelimb of an immature individual and a relatively large portion of the antler of a mature individual; (4) the isolated cranium of a beaver, and (5) the isolated cranium of a medium-size bird. Interestingly, following the closure of the kiva, a pit was dug into the fill alongside the still-standing northeastern cornerpost and yet another dog-this time a decapitated dog-was interred just above the floor. In short, the objects deposited in the northeastern quadrant of the kiva both during and after its closure included a preponderance of animal remains. A very different assemblage of floor objects was found in the southeastern quadrant. Rather than bone, a large number of macrobotanical remains were</page><page sequence="14">38 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH unearthed, including an unburned portion of a woven yucca basket or mat and a dense concentration of carbonized pine needles and twigs, the latter most likely the remains of pine boughs that had been deposited on the floor in their entirety before being burned. An intact Taos Plain "bean pot" had been placed on the floor next to the southeastern cornerpost; it was found overturned and covering two corncobs and the remains of pifion pinecones. A dense pile of carbonized corn cupules, cobs, and husks was also found in the southeastern quadrant. Given the lack of evidence of burning elsewhere in the structure, it is likely that the corn had been intentionally set on fire, probably as a formal offering associated with the closure of the kiva. Two final objects from the southeastern floor area are worth mentioning, both of which were agricultural implements lying on either side of the pile of corn. The first was the fire-hardened end of what appears to have been a gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) digging stick, and the second was a fibrolite axe of the sort that are known to have formerly played critical roles in the clearing of agricultural fields (Caywood 1966:26; Fallon and Wening 1982:75; Richard Ford, personal communication 2001). The floor of the southeastern quadrant of the kiva, therefore, might be described as adorned with a variety of offerings related to agriculture and plants. Considered together, then, the patterning of closure objects left on the floor of the D-shaped kiva expresses the same dualism that we have already noted at the village-wide level. The nature of the closure objects, however, permits us to see particular symbolic associations with much greater clarity: north/hunting/animal structurally opposed south/agriculture/plants. Recall that this is precisely the same symbolism that was a fundamental part of the historic moiety systems at Taos and Picuris pueblos. Summary With respect to the question of the antiquity of the Northern Tiwa moiety system, posed earlier, we can now state with confidence that its main components-e.g., socio-ceremonial divisions between north/south, winter/ summer, hunting/agriculture, etc.-were already in place by the start of the fourteenth century. As we have seen, these divisions deeply structured the ritual life of T'aittina's occupants; indeed, dualism was a highly redundant pattern that was replicated at a variety of community levels. Whether this meant that the community itself was divided into two groups for ceremonial purposes only or that these divisions had a larger, social and perhaps even initially kin-based salience is, as yet, unclear. Nevertheless, it does indicate that moieties were adopted in some form at least as early in the Taos district as in the ancestral Tewa region to the south and west. One cannot, therefore, simply explain away the historic Northern Tiwa moieties as the product of piecemeal cultural diffusion or borrowing that occurred well after the mature system had been established in neighboring areas. Thus are we led to the larger questions of why and how moiety organization emerged in the Eastern Pueblo tradition-and among the ancestral Northern Tiwa in particular- in the first place.</page><page sequence="15">MOIETY ORGANIZATION AMONG THE EASTERN PUEBLOS 39 A HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE ORIGIN OF NORTHERN TIWA MOIETIES Were we to follow traditional models, we might be tempted to answer such questions by arguing that moiety organization was an effective means of social integration that emerged as an adaptation to the new social challenges associated with the shift to aggregated village life.4 Lowie (1948:247), for example, discussed the moiety system cross-culturally as "a form of organization that naturally and, in some cases, inevitably arises from demographic conditions." In other words, we might posit that as the scale and density of communities increased, dual divisions evolved as a relatively egalitarian means of managing decision-making and submerging social tensions. This, indeed, was the sort of model originally suggested by Eggan in his discussion of the moieties of the Eastern Pueblos: Dual organizations in a broad sense are devices to organize and regulate rivalry and opposition in order to serve the purposes of the group as a whole ... they control ceremonial rivalry by regulating competition and dividing responsibility in channeled areas (Eggan 1950:302). Eggan's thesis is a classic example of a functionalist model of tribal religion with affinities to work such as Gluckman's (1963) on African rituals of rebellion. In this tradition, the purported function of ceremonial organization-here, the moiety or dual division system-is to redirect social tensions into highly structured ritual contexts in which those tensions are able to be safely expressed and overcome. By an unspecified trick of social alchemy, rivalry is transformed into solidarity: "Rivalry between the moieties ... [becomes] a way of fostering tribal solidarity and of nourishing a healthy esprit de corps" (White 1959:162). Thus it is concluded that the clear advantages to the community as a whole are, in and of themselves, sufficient reasons for both the emergence and perpetuation of the system. The central problem with such explanations, however, is that they mystify social change by unrealistically implying that structures "naturally and inevitably arise" as systemic adaptations following abstract principles of organizational logic. In practice, social life is much more complicated. Not surprisingly, when actual examples of moiety formation have been documented throughout the world, quite particular historical events are frequently found to assume causal priority. Lowie (1961:136-7), indeed, had noted as much in 1920, citing, for example, the case of the Masai in which a moiety organization formed as a result of two kin groups uniting in social opposition to a third. (Lowie referred to this as an example of the "secondary origin of moieties.") A more detailed example of emergent moiety organization, however, is to be found in Michael Smith's (1960:139-40) analysis of political development among the Kagoro of Nigeria. At the time of Smith's study, Kagoro society was divided into two moieties: the senior Ankwei moiety and the junior Kpashan moiety. The Ankwei moiety was composed of those social groups that claimed traditional residence within-and ownership of-Kagoro country; consequently they assumed primary ritual leadership of Kagoro society as</page><page sequence="16">40 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH a whole. The Kpashan moiety, on the other hand, was a relatively recent creation, pieced together from a congeries of unrelated refugees who had joined the Ankwei during the nineteenth century to escape the military predation of the Hausa-Fulani. As newcomers and guests of the Ankwei, the Kpashan moiety was granted few ritual prerogatives. The case of Kagoro moiety formation is a rich one that paints a detailed picture of how a dual organization might actually be constructed over the course of real, historical time. Two points in particular deserve special emphasis, however. First, Smith's analysis reveals that the moiety system was consciously constructed by a dominant people to deal with the sudden presence of relatively large numbers of immigrants in their midst. Dualism, from one perspective then, was thrust upon the Kagoro by the currents of history rather than by a systemic response to their economic practices or population scale per se. Second, Kagoro moiety organization was designed so as to institutionalize a set of ritual and political inequalities; it did not, in other words, lead to the establishment of a fully egalitarian or reciprocal relationship between the two divisions, such as is ,commonly assumed to be the case in moiety systems generally. If I have lingered on the Kagoro case, it is only out of a conviction that somewhat comparable sorts of dynamics were involved in the emergence of moiety organization among the ancestral Northern Tiwa. To explore this possibility, let us briefly consider the larger historical context in which the early Northern Tiwa moieties were set. The thirteenth century was a time of major population realignments throughout the Pueblo world. Archaeological research suggests that Pueblo groups from the San Juan Basin and other western homelands were actively flooding east and had begun to produce the complex linguistic/ethnic heterogeneity encountered by the Spanish in the sixteenth century in the Rio Grande Valley (Ford et al. 1972; Wendorf and Reed 1955). Demographic studies based on survey data from the Santa Fe district (Crown et al. 1996; Dickson 1979) and the Pajarito Plateau (Orcutt 1999) clearly document this population increase in the ancestral Tewa regions (see also Stuart and Gauthier 1988:51). In the Taos district, a recent synthesis of existing survey data from the Rio Grande del Rancho drainage also indicates that population peaked during the early thirteenth century as a result of a wave of immigration into that area that probably began during the late twelfth century (Fowles 2004a:889-915). Given that the Northern Tiwa village of T'aitina arose on the heels of these population changes, any explanation of the origin of its moiety organization must come to terms with the role played by the historical intersection of local and foreign populations. Indeed, it is quite likely that during the early thirteenth century the "ancestral Northern Tiwa" were less a coherent ethnic entity than they were a multi-ethnic and multilingual congeries of autochthonous and immigrant groups living in uneasy relations with one another. In this regard, it is particularly interesting that the last of the sites within what we might refer to as the purely "indigenous" tradition--that is, those late twelfth century or terminal Valdez phase pithouse sites dominated by Taos Incised pottery-typically contain skeletal assemblages characterized by</page><page sequence="17">MOIETY ORGANIZATION AMONG THE EASTERN PUEBLOS 41 extraordinarily high levels of violent death. Decapitation, crushed bones, axe wounds, multiple informal interments, and so on, are all exhibited in these assemblages with much greater frequency than during any other local prehistoric period (Fowles 2004a:362-65; Whitley 2000). It appears, then, that the arrival of immigrants in the Taos district was marked by violence and led to the demise of many of the dispersed local residents. In the Pueblo Southwest we are rarely led to model such a "conquest" or subordination of a local community by a group of immigrants, despite the fact that this was a common occurrence in tribal social contexts elsewhere in the world (e.g., Godelier 1986:85-89; Kelly 1985). This is partly attributable to the fact that all our ethnographic or ethnohistoric observations come from a period in the development of Pueblo societies when large, defensible villages were already a universal way of life. As we know from a number of well- documented examples, immigrating groups during the Historical period were typically incorporated into already established communities only on the conditions set by the local communities themselves (e.g., Dozier 1966b; Ellis 1979). But the situation would have been very different during the Coalition period as immigrant groups from the west-accustomed as they were to the more centralized social organizations within the Chacoan and Mesa Verdean systems-encountered the dispersed and decentralized local populations of the Rio Grande. Might a moiety system have been adopted, in part, as a means of coming to terms with the cultural heterogeneity of the Taos district in the aftermath of such a confrontation? Might the encounter between a group of autochthons and a group of immigrants have prompted the institutionalization of a dual division as the population coalesced into a few large villages?5 This scenario becomes all the more plausible when we also consider the strong possibility that deeply seated notions of socioceremonial dualism may have already been part of the intellectual baggage brought by western immigrants into the Rio Grande Valley at the close of the twelfth century. Indeed, there can be little doubt that dualism was a major structuring principle during the preceding Pueblo II period in Chaco Canyon and, by extension, in much of the greater Chacoan world. This case has been made on architectural grounds with respect both to the division between Bonito great houses and Hosta Butte villages (Vivian 1970, 1990) as well as to the structural principles underlying individual great houses (Fritz 1978) and the mortuary complexes therein (Heitman and Plog 2003). Andrew Duff (personal communication 2004; also Lipe and Ortman 2000:108) has made the interesting observation that such Chacoan patterns may have also been ancestral to the bilateral structure of many thirteenth-century villages in the Mesa Verde region, some of which were intentionally situated in such a way as to be divided by a small spring and its runoff (e.g., Sand Canyon Pueblo and Goodman Pueblo [Varien et al. 1996: Fig. 7.4]). Compare such Mesa Verdean sites, bisected as they were by drainages, with (1) the Tewa tradition that their moiety groups once lived on either side of the Rio Grande (Ortiz 1969) and (2) the division of modern Taos Pueblo into north and south complexes on either side of the Rio Pueblo de Taos (the latter, a comparison already noted by Lipe and Ortman 2000:108). The similarities are obvious, and we might therefore suppose that these patterns, as well</page><page sequence="18">42 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH as the larger traditions of community dualism of which they were a part, were simply variants on a common theme-a theme, perhaps, that was recycled once again at T'aitona to deal with the new social challenges of the Coalition period.6 Of course, no Pueblo community ever lived in a conceptual vacuum. Despite the occasionally stringent rules of intercommunity secrecy (Brandt 1980), we know that certain basic notions were circulated over wide areas (Adams 1991; Crown 1994; Ware 2001:84; Ware and Blinman 2000), and the bipartite division of community and cosmos would appear to have been one of those notions that had a regional, long-term manifestation. Nevertheless, my sense is that whatever pan- Southwestern account of the development of Pueblo dualism is ultimately written, it will necessarily be a complicated one composed of a tangled web of diverse intellectual tangents rather than the coherent evolutionary story of a single grand idea. In this sense, it would be incorrect to explain away Eastern Pueblo moiety organization as simply the old Chacoan seed of dualism, transplanted and flowering in the fertile soils of the Rio Grande Valley. To do so would be to ignore both the transformative historical experiences of Pueblo III immigration and ethnic conflict as well as the contributions of the Rio Grande autochthons themselves who appear to have had only limited prior participation in Chacoan culture. Instead, we must struggle to understand the emergence of Eastern Pueblo moieties as the product, to borrow a phrase from Bloch (1977), of the past and the present in the past. As we have seen, the archaeological remains in the ancestral Northern Tiwa region already permit us to do this to an extent, but we stand to gain even more by consulting Taos oral history, which, interestingly, echoes the archaeological narrative in a variety of important respects. Members of Taos Pueblo, for example, maintain that the core of their community initially formed as a result of the intersection of two ethnic groups: the Winter (or Ice) People and the Summer People (see Stevenson n.d.: Files 2.19, 2.29, and 3.2). These two groups are described as originating in different homelands, speaking different languages, wearing different clothes, practicing different economic strategies, etc. For some time, each group lived in ignorance of the other; but there came a day when a small group of Winter People, while out on a hunting expedition to the south, happened upon the settlement of the Summer People. Taos oral history suggests that this initial meeting was brief and peaceful. However, it was later discovered that the Winter People had fundamentally tainted the community of the Summer People, so the latter traveled north on the warpath seeking revenge. Arriving at the northern settlement, the Summer People used their superior ritual and military skills to conquer and subdue the Winter People, after which, so the story goes, the father of the Summer People proclaimed the following words of victory: "Now you are my child. Now I have a good large family (referring to the Winter People)."... The father of the Summer People continued addressing the Winter People, "Now we are as one family. If you desire, come to where I live. We will have summer and we will also have winter"... [And so,] the Winter People moved from their home to a point much nearer to the Summer People [Stevenson n.d.: File 2.29].</page><page sequence="19">MOIETY ORGANIZATION AMONG THE EASTERN PUEBLOS 43 "We will have summer and we will also have winter"-this, I suggest, may well have been a way of saying that the ancestral Northern Tiwa were to have a Summer or Southside Moiety and a Winter or Northside Moiety. In the version of the Taos origin story recorded by Espinosa (1936:133), we are told that the joint settlement of the Summer and Winter Peoples (a.k.a. the Feather and Day Peoples) was located in the Rio Grande del Rancho drainage. Presumably, this settlement was T'aitjna itself, the large late Coalition period village that we have already seen was organized around a dominant principle of dualism. The words of the father of the Summer People, quoted above, also alert us to another interesting possibility. Note that in addressing the conquered Winter People, he referred to them as his child. The term "child," as used in this context, would not have been intended as commentary on the addressee's age in absolute years, nor would it have been a metaphor indexing an affectionate or parental relationship. Rather, "child" must here be read as a specific and culturally charged category that in historical times has been used to refer to a relationship of religiopolitical subordination (Brandt 1980:141; Brown 1979:262; Fowles 2004a:42, 735). Based on the origin story, then, it is reasonable to speculate that the Summer People incorporated the Winter People into their ranks as a lower- status group. Is there any archaeological evidence of comparable inequalities within the dual divisions at T'aitdna? Artifacts provide no such evidence: the ceramics associated with the southside roomblocks, for example, are no fancier than those of the north; turquoise and jet are extremely rare throughout the site; and mortuary offerings were characteristically few in all parts of the village. Architecture, on the other hand, tells a slightly different story. First, the southside roomblocks are noticeably larger and have greater evidence of multistory construction than those of the north. This difference in scale and elevation would have been all the more impressive given that the southern roomblocks were perched on what appears to be a natural rise some three meters above the prehistoric ground surface of their northern counterparts. All in all, the architecture of the southside or Summer moiety at T'aitina would have been by far the largest and most visually impressive portion of the village. Second, recall that only the southside roomblocks were equipped with large mealing bin rooms. However these facilities were used-whether in a ritual or an economic capacity, or both-they were undoubtedly controlled by the southside group. As in the origin story, then, architectural evidence does indeed suggest that the moiety system initiated at T'aitina was not the result of the union of two entirely equal groups. To summarize the above argument, I have suggested that it was the intersection of resident and recently arrived populations that provided essential raw material for the reinvention of dual organization at T'aitona. Two village divisions for two formerly distinct ethnic traditions-this, I suspect, represented the redeployment of inherited ideas to socially and conceptually organize the new experiences of immigration and ethnic conflict that are well documented in both Northern Tiwa oral history and archaeology.</page><page sequence="20">44 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH EASTERN PUEBLO MOIETY ORGANIZATION AND FACTIONALISM It is precisely at this point, however, that the advocate of a structural-functionalist position might interject: Inasmuch as the Northern Tiwa moiety system was conditioned by prevailing historical realities, perhaps its origin was not an entirely "natural" phenomenon. But isn't the system itself still a clear example of an organizational adaptation that arose to resolve the inherent social tensions that would have existed in such a newly aggregated and multiethnic context? We must respond to such questions, I think, by asking in return what evidence exists that moiety organization was effective in "resolving" social tensions at all. Indeed, T'ait6na was abruptly abandoned in AD 1319 or so (Crown 1991), only two or three generations after the dual division was established. When the villagers left, some of T'ait6na's rooms were in the midst of construction, others remained filled with stored corn, and one room in particular housed the "badly treated" bodies of two individuals (an adult woman and an infant) who had suffered violent deaths shortly before or during the abandonment process. The picture is one of a community that had intended to remain in the village for a longer period of time, but that was forced to leave in the face of unanticipated problems. Given the near absence of whole vessels or other usable objects on the floors of the late- component rooms, these "unanticipated problems" appear not to have involved some sort of major attack on the village from without. Rather, it is more likely that the problems arose within the resident community. Regarding this possibility it is particularly interesting to note that oral histories recorded at both Taos and Picurfs pueblos attest to a past factional dispute that led to the breakup of what was once claimed to have been a unified ancestral Northern Tiwa community (Fowles 2004a:706-7). Rather than promote social cohesion, then, it is entirely possible that the institutionalization of dual divisions with the T'aitiSna community instead bred irreconcilable differences and, ultimately, village fission. This last point highlights yet another drawback to past functionalist models of the origins of Eastern Pueblo moiety organization. By wedding themselves to the position that moiety relationships necessarily fostered community solidarity, such models leave little room for the possibility of internally driven social change as a result of intra-community competition and factionalism. Indeed, most treatments of moiety" organization have granted moieties far too much structural stability, as they have Eastern Pueblo villages in general. It is a common perception, for example, that the Eastern Pueblos were traditionally more tightly "integrated" than their Western Pueblo counterparts, the latter of which are viewed as having been more prone to dissention and village fission. Fred Plog (1978:363-64) expressed this clearly when he wrote that there are strong structural units within any Western Pueblo village but not within either Eastern Pueblo or Keresan villages. Moieties [in the latter villages] crosscut one another too much to be strong. In this sense, the Western Pueblo village is at least potentially a number of different villages, whereas the Eastern Pueblo village is a village, period.</page><page sequence="21">MOIETY ORGANIZATION AMONG THE EASTERN PUEBLOS 45 Why is this presumed to be so? Plog suggested that the Western Pueblos were essentially built to fission as an adaptation to their riskier, more variable environments whereas the irrigation and greater environmental predictability of the Eastern Pueblos led them to attain a higher level of social stability through the development of interdependent dual divisions (cf. Dozier 1960:150-51; Wittfogel and Goldfrank 1943). There are two major problems with this model, however. The first is that most Eastern Pueblo villages did break apart during the late Coalition and Classic periods, T'aitina being among them. Granted external forces were often at play, but we can assume that internal divisiveness was also a significant factor in many cases. The second problem is that there is no shortage of references to serious factionalism in the ethnographic record of the Eastern Pueblos (e.g., Fenton 1957; Fox 1967:58-62; French 1948; Lange 1990:391-92; Whitman 1947). Some factional divisions, in fact, ran along moiety lines in a manner that directly contradicts Plog's assumption mentioned above. The famous case of long- term factionalism at Santa Clara Pueblo in which the Summer Moiety was pitted against the Winter Moiety provides a dramatic example. Superficially, Santa Clara factionalism was also driven by a contest between "progressives" and "conservatives." As was the case in the Orayvi split (Levy 1992; Whiteley 1988), however, the resulting contest was underlain by much deeper power negotiations within the indigenous ritual system itself. Dozier (1966a:177) observed that the Summer Moiety traditionally had greater control over village religiopolitics and that this was an inequality to which the Winter Moiety took offense. The events surrounding the split are revealing: The most important result of the schism was the breakdown of community co-operation. The co-operative activities of the two moieties in communal ceremonies such as the transfer rituals disappeared. The large plaza dances, which required the participation of the whole village, ceased to be performed.... Since membership in the esoteric associations was drawn from members of the village as a whole, without regard to moiety affiliation, their proper performances of ceremonies and retreats was also seriously hampered. In some cases members of these associations refused to sever their membership and continued to carry out their activities. In a few instances duplicate organizations arose complementing the moiety system; in others, where only a few members of one moiety were represented, such individuals simply dropped out (Dozier 1966a:179; see also Aitken 1930; Hill 1982:190-201; Parsons 1974:90). The Santa Clara case presents us with an example of a factional split along moiety lines that, in prehistoric times--or, more accurately, in pre-reservation times-would have led to the fission of the village into two separate communities (Dozier 1966a: 177). Already, each moiety had begun to individually replicate the ritual positions of the other, a process of mitosis that was on its way to the creation of two fully autonomous ceremonial systems. Intermarriage between the two moieties was even significantly curtailed (Dozier 1966a:180).7</page><page sequence="22">46 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Plog's assertion that "the Eastern Pueblo village is a village, period," therefore, is clearly incorrect. True, Eastern Pueblo moieties have come to be predicated on a principle of complementarity, and, as Ortiz (1969:123) revealed, there are typically a number of structural mechanisms that account for how such villages "can be divided and integrated at the same time." Nevertheless, this system only works insofar as community members are willing to make it work, and herein lies a critical point. Simply because the dual divisions within a particular society are interdependent at one point in time does not mean that they are inherently or necessarily bound in solidarity. Moieties are not, as White (1959:160; see also Ortiz 1969:84) sought to describe them, like two magnetic poles that together form an unbreakable and balanced unity. For whatever reasons it may arise, factionalism is a process in which individuals are forced to pick sides, and the presence of numerous cross-cutting social, ritual, and/or economic ties simply means that community members have a variety of options regarding which of those ties they emphasize, and which they ignore or even terminate (see Beals and Siegel 1966:156-57; Yoffee 2004). In such contexts, moieties become alternate lines of social division that can act as the social mechanism or emblem of factionalism, as can clans. CONCLUSION In the above discussion I have sought to document (1) that the Eastern Pueblo moiety system was already present by the late Coalition period and (2) that this system-among the Northern Tiwa, at least-may have been initially adopted as a means of negotiating the historical intersection of different ethnic groups during a period of heightened demographic instability and migration. I have argued that we can see the clear archaeological signature of dualism at the early village of T'aitona in such things as the distribution of closure objects on the floor of a ritual facility and the morphology and orientation of architecture at the level of the village as a whole. Relative to those of the other Eastern Pueblos, therefore, the Northern Tiwa moieties were neither late developments nor were they simply borrowed in piecemeal fashion as a sort of ceremonial veneer. Indeed, T'aittina currently provides us with the earliest substantial evidence of moiety organization anywhere in the Rio Grande region. This is not to say, of course, that the original notion of dualism was itself born in the Taos district during the late thirteenth century; as I have noted, the underlying principles of Eastern Pueblo moiety organization appear to have a much deeper ancestry. Nevertheless, it is clear that "dualism" had a new and profound relevance to the Coalition period residents of the Rio Grande Valley, quite likely as a metaphor for understanding (without really resolving) the emergent social conflicts between western migrants coming out of the Chaco and Mesa Verde traditions, on the one hand, and the more decentralized indigenous populations, on the other. Accepting this, we must further acknowledge that inherited notions of dualism would have been substantially transformed in the process by virtue of their application to new problems. Consequently, the emergence of Eastern Pueblo</page><page sequence="23">MOIETY ORGANIZATION AMONG THE EASTERN PUEBLOS 47 moiety organization, like all historical phenomena, must be simultaneously viewed as both derivative and creative. Let us not, therefore, settle for structural-functionalist analyses in which moieties are portrayed as group adaptations to such things as the decision-making challenges in large, aggregated populations, the managerial demands of new agricultural techniques, etc., as they may have existed in a given prehistoric "present." In the case of the Northern Tiwa I have argued that their moieties can only be satisfactorily understood with reference to the specific cards-the intellectual inheritance, past ethnic encounters, and unresolved conflicts-that history has dealt them. Additional cases should be similarly placed in their own particular historical trajectories to examine why a dual division may have been adopted as an appropriate means of organizing society in lieu of other options at given points in time. This is to say that we must always pay close attention to the ways in which social patterns-such as the moiety divisions discussed herein- were historically contingent. Indeed, if we are to say that societies are adaptive at all, then it must be acknowledged that they adapt not just to present exigencies, but to those of the past as well. Social memories, descendant identities, lingering ethnic biases, and the like are all tangible components of human communities and provide rationales for individual and group action that can-and often do-result in outcomes that are poorly suited or even maladaptive to the current social or economic situation when considered in isolation. As such, they can sow the seeds for future internal contradictions and ongoing community change. These last observations, of course, merely amount to a reiteration of the old critiques of structural-functionalism generally: that as an interpretative framework it is fundamentally ahistorical and-when rigidly adhered to-provides no means of breaking into questions regarding the origins of, or change in, those structures over time. Nevertheless, these are critiques that remain especially germane to much archaeological research and bear repetition.

In the following discussion, the past tense will generally be used despite the fact that many of the patterns described probably continue to characterize Taos and Picurfs Pueblos today. 2. As determined by the alignment of kiva features. 3. The pueblos conceptualize the solstices somewhat differently than does the Western world. Among the Hopi, for example, "summer" is conceived as beginning at the December (our winter) solstice and ending at the June (our summer) solstice (Parsons 1939). We have little information from the Northern Tiwa themselves on this matter; but it is telling, perhaps, that at Picurfs the term for December solstice translates as "summer-turning"-in other words, as the moment at which the sun turns back towards the summer (Parsons 1936).</page><page sequence="24">48 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Furthermore, in the Taos origin story (Stevenson n.d.: File 2.29) it is the Summer People from the Southside kiva group-endowed as they are with the mythic lightning arrows- who were able to melt the ice and snow of winter and return the world to its green, productive state. Within the native system of thought, then, it is the Summer People who would be expected to focus their ritual energies on the December solstice. 4. Adams (1991) presents similar arguments regarding the origin of the katsina cult. 5. This is not to say that either group-the "locals" or the "immigrants"-was internally homogeneous with respect to cultural heritage or even language. Nevertheless, as was the case in the Kagoro example, it is likely that the tumultuous population dynamics within the Taos district during the early thirteenth century had a dichotomizing effect in which households emphasized their cultural solidarity with one or the other social category. The violence that accompanied the Coalition period immigration into the region may have made such side-taking imperative. 6. Regarding this possibility, the fact that members of Taos Pueblo regularly make religious pilgrimages to, and consider ancestral, Chimney Rock Pueblo (Andrew Gulliford, Center of Southwest Studies, Fort Lewis College, Durango, Colorado, personal communication 2004)-an eleventh-century Chacoan Great House that was dominated by dual Great Kivas-may be particularly significant. On the larger issue of the historical connections between Chaco and the Eastern Pueblos, see Ware 2001. 7. A tendency towards moiety endogamy, in fact, existed at most of the Tewa villages (Parsons 1974:91) and at Jemez Pueblo (Sando 1979:425). This pattern is quite interesting given that it indicates that the structural relationship with, arguably, the most "integrative potential"--that of intermarriage between the two moieties-was not a strong part of the Pueblo moiety tradition. This nicely highlights, once again, one of our central observations in the present essay: that the Eastern Pueblo moieties must not be solely interpreted as systemic adaptations that functioned and were designed to build village-wide solidarity.
