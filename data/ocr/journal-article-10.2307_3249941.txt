<plain_text><page sequence="1">SONYA RHIE QUINTANILLA AYAGAPATAS: CHARACTERISTICS, SYMBOLISM, AND CHRONOLOGYI T he large, intricately carved stone plaques, such as that illustrated in Figure 2I, called "dydgapata" in epigraphical hybrid Sanskrit generally have been understood as Jaina votive tablets of hom- age, which were produced in the north Indian city ofMathura during the first century B.c. and first century A.D. Although scholars writing over the past hundred years discussed some of these unique plaques in the context of studies in early Indian sculpture, no systematic analysis of the known cor- pus of at least twenty-eight dydgapa.tas has hitherto been advanced.2 This article aims to present a more accurate definition of dyagapatas and a clearer understanding of their function and symbolic relief carvings, while orienting them within a broader and more precise chronological scope. I I wish to express deep appreciation to Pramod Chandra, George P. Bickford Professor of Indian and South Asian Art at Harvard University, for his teachings and his ever-helpful advice and concern with my work. For their generous assistance and valuable comments, I would also like to thank Michael Witzel, Wales Professor of Sanskrit at Har- vard University; David Gordon Mitten, Loeb Professor of Classical Art at Harvard University; Richard Salomon, Professor of Asian Languages at the University of Washington, Seattle; and Dr.phil. Oscar von Hintiber, Professor fiir Indologie, Freiburg. I am also indebted to Dr. R. C. Sharma, director of the Bharat Kala Bhavan, Banaras Hindu University; Dr. N. P. Joshi and Dr. S. D. Trivedi, former directors of the State Museum, Lucknow; Mr. Girraj Prasad, Mr. Moolchand, and Dr. Jitendra Kumar, former director of the Government Museum, Mathura; J. E. Dawson of the National Museum, New Delhi; Mr. S. M. Sethi, curator of the State Museum, Himachal Pradesh; Dr. Michael Willis, curator of Oriental Antiquities, the British Museum, London; and Ms. Zsuzsanna Renner of the Ferenc Hopp Museum of Eastern Asiatic Arts, Budapest, all of whom were indispensable in affording me the opportunities to study and photograph dydgapatas. Research and travel in India and Europe were funded by grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and Harvard University. 2 Some noteworthy publications, among the many that refer to ayagapatas, include the following: Vincent A. Smith first published a group of ten ayagapatas, mainly from Kaikali-Tila at Mathura in Thejain Stupa and Other Antiq- uitiesfrom Mathura (Archaeological Survey of India, New Imperial Series XX; North-Western Provinces and Oudh, V: Muttra Antiquities, 19oo). J. E. van Lohuizen-de Leeuw published her ground-breaking insights into the early date of several dydgapatas in The Scythian Period: An Approach to the History, Art, Epigraphy and Paleography of North India from the Ist Century B.c. to the 3rd Century A.D. (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1949). U. P. Shah, in Studies in jaina Art (Banaras: Jaina Cultural Research Society, 1955), 77-84, presented incisive descriptions of nine ayagapa.tas with valu- able interpretations regarding elements of their carvings, inscriptions, and dates. N. P. Joshi provided the most com- prehensive list of dydgapatas given to date in "Early Jaina Icons of Mathura," Mathura: The Cultural Heritage, ed. Doris M. Srinivasan (New Delhi: American Institute of Indian Studies, 1989), 332-67. Other important contribu- tions were made by V. S. Agrawala, particularly in Indian Art: A History of Indian Artfrom the Earliest Times up to the Third Century A.D. (Varanasi: Prithivi Prakashan, 1965) and "Catalogue of the Mathura Museum III: Jaina Tirthaikaras and other Miscellaneous Figures,""Journal of the U.P. Historical Society, XXIII (195o), 35-37; by Debala Mitra, "Mathura: Early History,"Jaina Art and Architecture, I, ed. A. Ghosh (New Delhi: BharatiyaJnanpith, 1974); by Prudence Meyer, "Bodhisattvas and Buddhas: Early Buddhist Images from Mathura," Artibus Asiae XLVII, no. I, (1986), Io7-42; and by R. Sengupta, "TheJaina Ayaga Platforms at Mathura- An Interpretation," Bulletin ofMuse- ums and Archaeology in U.P.IX (1972), 23-29. 79</page><page sequence="2">The available archaeological, literary and epigraphical evidence suggests that dyagapatas were integral elements of sacred precincts, where they were venerated as objects of worship and possibly used in meditation and teaching. Furthermore it will be suggested that these plaques may have been produced in other regions as well as at Mathura, and there is a distinct possibility that they were used by members of a number of religious traditions other than that of the Jaina community. Careful stylistic considerations of their relief carvings and inscriptions reveal that dyagapatas fall into two major categories, namely the diagrammatic and the pictorial, and they probably were made throughout a period spanning at least four hundred years. As we shall observe, a study ofdydgapatas is essential for a fuller understanding of the artistic developments and cultural history of India, par- ticularly during the otherwise obscure period before the reign of the Kusdna emperor Kaniska in the early second century A.D.3 PART I Defining Characteristics ofAiydgapatas Before discussing the chronology ofdydgapa.tas and the meaning of their carvings, I shall first attempt to define them, so that they can be identified and distinguished from other kinds of plaques or slabs. The meaning and etymology of the word dydgapata is controversial, and the diversity of the carvings on the objects inscribed as dydgapata contributes to the difficulty in determining a suitable definition for all of them. However, we can identify some unifying features, which I shall discuss in Part I of this study, along with other issues such as the sectarian affiliation, original context, possible func- tion, and information regarding the donors ofdydgapatas. Definition and Classification The customary translation of the word dydgapa.ta as "votive tablet of homage" neither accurately nor fully conveys its meaning. No textual or epigraphical reference that explicates the meaning or function ofdydgapatas seems to have come to light, and the interpretations suggested by the few schol- ars who have undertaken a philological or etymological analysis of the word dydgapa.ta have been var- ied and often conflicting.4 3 For the purposes of this article circa first quarter of the second century A.D. serves as the date marking the beginning of the reign of the Kusana emperor Kaniska. This approximate dating seems to generally concur with most studies put forth regarding the problem of the date of Kaniska, including some of the latest numismatic and epigraphic evi- dence, as particularly provided by the Rabatak inscription. See inter alia Joe Cribb and Nicholas Sims-Williams, "A New Bactrian Inscription of Kanishka the Great," in Silk Road Art and Archaeology 4 (1995/96), 75-I42. However, the date of Kaniska remains controversial, and the possibility of the beginning of his reign dating during the last quarter of the first century A.D. remains open. Cf. G. Fussman, "L'Inscription de Rabatak et L'Origine de L'Ere Saka," Journal Asiatique 286, no. 2 (1998), 571-651. 4 V. S. Agrawala suggests that dydga is derived from the Sanskrit word daryaka (from the root \/ri), meaning "wor- shipful" or "honorable" (Indian Art, 231). However, in the dialect of Prakrit in the region of Mathura at this time, drya should become dya, not ayd (see Appendix no. xv, notes). R. Sengupta suggests that dydga is derived from the Greek word agyieus, which refers to an apotropeic pillar associated with the god Apollo (op. cit., 23-24). Both V. S. Agrawala and R. Sengupta consider the word dayaga to be a version of the word dyaka, which is found in Amaravati 80</page><page sequence="3">The compound word dydgapa.ta seems to occur only in the donative inscriptions carved upon the objects themselves; ten examples of the word survive.5 It is a compound formed by the two words "ayaga"and "pa.ta"(Sanskrit patta). The meaning of pa.ta is uncontestedly rendered as "plaque" or "slab". However, the meaning of the wordadydga is more obscure, and the type ofcase-dependent com- pound relationship between ayaga and pa.ta is also uncertain. Aydga seems to have been a rare word, since it occurs only once in the Rdmdyana and once in the Mkahdbharata;6 it also is found twice in the Jaina divination text, the Angavijjda, which probably dates to around the fourth century A.D. These literary references and their later commentaries assist in interpreting the meaning ofayaga. In the Radmdyana the bow in Janaka's palace, which was a gift from the gods that could be strung only by Rdma, is called an "ayagabhftam", and it was venerated in the palace as an object of worship.7 One commentator on this passage calls the bow a "dhanuradyadga," 8 while another explains dydgabhZ- tam as "yajanfyadevatd-bhftam."9 "9Bhftam" refers to a being, or something that has become something else or is likened to something else. "Devatd" means "divinity", and "yajanfya" means "to be wor- shipped." Therefore, it seems that dydga was understood as a yajaniyadevatd, or "a divinity to be wor- shipped." Hence, the bow in Janaka's palace, which was under worship, can be understood as an object that was like something sacred that was to be worshipped like a divinity (yajaniyadevatd), or as noted more specifically in the other commentary, a dhanurdyaga, meaning "a bow (dhanus) that is [like] a divinity to be worshipped." This meaning ofdyaga as something divine to be worshipped also seems appropriate in the other textual contexts. In the Mahdbhdrata the Sarasvati River is described as being beloved of the gand- inscriptions. James Burgess, Heinrich Liiders, and K. Gopalachari translate dyaka as "entrance" or "something at the entrance" (derived from the root \/yd plus the prefix d- meaning "to enter or approach"). See. Sengupta, 23-24. 5 Appendix inscription numbers ix, x, xi, xvii, xviii, xix, xx, xxii, xxiii, and xxiv. 6 A computer search of the entire Mahhdbhdrata and Rdmayana was performed in order to locate the word dydga, which was found only once in each text. 7 The Rdmdyana of Vdlmiki with the Commentary (Tilaka) of Rdma, Part I, ed.

Gregory Schopen discussed the similar difficulty with translating the compound "caityabhbta," and he con- cluded that -bhfta was intended to establish a comparison. Gregory Schopen, "The Phrase 'sa prthiviprade'a' caitya- bh to bhavet' in the Vajracchedikd: Notes on the Cult of the Book in Maha-yana," Indo-Iranian Journal XVII (1975), I47-81. 81</page><page sequence="4">harvas, yaksas, and devarsis, and having become like an ayaga of the gods themselves.Io The Sarasvati River was considered a holy river, even in early Vedic sources, and the land abutting the river served as the sacrifice ground of the gods, and thereby was sacred to the gods., Thus it is plausible that the holy Sarasvati River was described as being "like something that had become a divinity to be wor- shipped even by the gods" (dydgabhutam iva devatdandm). In the Angavijjda, written in Prakrit, the word dyaga occurs twice, first in a list of essential ele- ments of the world: mountain (parvata), ocean (sdgara), earth (medini), river (nadi), temple or sacred place (cetiya), and ayadga.I In this list our working meaning ofayaga as a divinity to be worshipped or a sacred object would be appropriate, especially following the word for temple or holy precinct (cetiya). The second occurrence of the word dydga is in Chapter 27 of the Argaviajjd where it appears in the con- text of the ritual of welcoming guests. Theprasdda is called dydgabali, which refers to a food-offering for one who is to be honored.'3 From the contexts provided by these literary sources, we seem to approach a meaning of the word dydga, such that dydgapata may best be understood as a plaque of a divinity or sacred object to be wor- shipped. This meaning of the word implies that dydgapa.tas themselves may have been objects of wor- ship, rather than ornamental platforms for receiving offerings, slabs that adorned the exterior face of stipas, or votive offerings to other images, as scholars have propounded.14 The meaning of the word dydgapa.ta, suggests that the objects to which it refers may in some way represent a divinity, supreme being, or a sacred object that is to be worshipped or venerated (yajaniyadevatd). The visual analyses of their carvings presented below in Part II seem to support this conclusion. Io tdm yaksa-gandharva-maharsi-kantdm aydgabhutam iva devatdndm sarasvatim prft-yutYS carantah sukham vijahrur naradevaputrdh Mahdbhdrata (AraZyakaparvan) III.I74.24. Translation: "The Sarasvati, beloved of the yaksas, gandharvas, and seers, has become like an dydga (a divinity to be worshipped) of the gods, and the sons of gods among men (the Pandavas) wandered about [in that region] with joy, spending their time happily."

S. Mishra considered dydgapatas to be renditions in stone of rafrgavalis, temporary decorative offerings made of colored powders or paints used in the worship ofJinas. See R. S. Mishra, "Ratigavali in Jain Literature and Early Jain Art,"Jain Art and Architecture, ed. R. C. Dwivedi (Jaipur: Center forJain Studies, g198o), 2. V. S. Agrawala interprets aydgapa.tas as being pupphdidhanas or puspagrahani-vedikids or "flower-offering platforms" provided at sacred sites to receive offerings of flowers made to other objects of worship. (V. S. Agrawala, Indian Art, 231.) U. P. Shah equates dydgapa.tas with balipagttas, which he states should be understood as platforms on which lay srdvakas or srdvikds placed their offerings to tutelary deities or Jaina gods (U. P. Shah, "Varddhamana-Vidya-Pata,"Journal of the Indian Soci- ety of Oriental Art IX [1941], 46), although elsewhere he does acknowledge that dydgapa.tas should be considered objects of worship. 82</page><page sequence="5">In form ayagapa.tas are broad, flat stone plaques, usually measuring about two to three feet square, though some are slightly rectangular, and about three inches thick. They are covered on only one face with carvings that can include iconic figures, celestial and mythical beings, auspicious symbols, and vegetal ornamentation.I5 The carvings on dydgapatas fall into two major types that I term "diagrammatic" and "pictorial." The former type is more common, since twenty-one diagrammatic dydgapa.tas survive, while there are only seven pictorial types. Diagrammatic ayagapa.tas have crowded, variegated imagery carved within a circular format in the center and a square format towards the extremities. (See, for example, figs. 18 and 2I). The constant, distinguishing feature of the diagrammatic type is the small central circle in which is depicted a sacred object, such as a stypa, cakra, lotus, or, most commonly, an image of a seated Jina (a supreme liberated being among the Jainas). This central object is surrounded by a symmetrical arrangement of w-shaped nandydvarta symbols,'6 except in one instance, the Year Twenty-One Aya-gapata (GMM 35.2563, fig. 11),'7 wherein the central lotus is immediately sur- rounded by the curving arms of a svastika. The diagrammatic dyagapa.tas are carved with varying degrees of complexity, some having a curved fish-tailed svastika surrounding the innermost concen- tric ring of o-shaped nandydvartas, as well as circular bands filled with flying celestial beings or com- prised of twisted garlands (figs. I3-I4). The carvings in the outer, square-format borders of dia- grammatic dyagapa.tas can include maigalas,,8 pillars (stambhas), composite anthropomorphic and theriomorphic creatures, and an inscription. (See, for example, figs. 14 and 22). 15 Some dyagapa.tas are carved on their reverse sides; however, upon close examination we can conclude that these reverse carvings are not contemporaneous with the main dydgapata carvings. They appear to have been added at a later date for a separate purpose. 16 The nandydvarta symbol, also known as a triratna, triiula, tilakaratna or nandipada, is a curved, trident shaped sym- bol (w), the outer prongs of which are much broader, often terminating in fish-tails, than the central pointed tine. It is usually included in sets of mangalas (see footnote 18), but in some contexts where it is found alone in combina- tion with a lotus flower, it can refer to the presence of the divinity, Jina or Buddha (e.g. fig. 32). Oscar von Hiniiber and Anna Maria Quagliotti cogently argued for its having been called a nandydvarta in early texts, hence this nomen- clature shall be followed in this article. Oscar von Hiniiber, "Das Nandyavarta-symbol," Zeitschrift der Deutschen Mor- genldndischen Gesellschaft, Supp. II; XVIII. Deutscher Orientalistentag I, b. 5 (1974), 356-65; and Anna Maria Quagliotti, Buddhapadas (Kamakura: Institute of Silk Road Studies, 1998), 79-94. 17 The dydgapa.tas will each be identified by the name of the donor in its inscription, when available, and the spelling of each name is transliterated directly from the inscription without Sanskritization. However, when damage to a plaque leaves no trace of a donor's name, it will be identified by a descriptive title or by its find-spot, if known. Oth- ers without surviving inscriptions, adequately distinctive descriptive characteristics, or known find-spot are desig- nated by the museum in which they are housed, if it is the only dydgapata in that museum, or by its year date, as is the case with this dydgapata, called the Year Twenty-One Ay-gapata. Those plaques that are called by another term besides "dydgapata" in their inscriptions will be designated by that term, such as "Silipa.ta" or "dyavati," which were probably synonymous with dydgapa.ta in these contexts. 18 Mangalas are auspicious symbols that are particularly popular in early Jaina art, though pervasive throughout the art of India. At this early period their number and content may vary according to text, sect, region, and time period, but they generally include the svastika, Srivatsa, nandydvarta, varddhamdnaka (powder flask), bhadrdsana (throne), purnakalasa (overflowing pot), darpana (mirror), and matsya-yugma (pair of fish) in various combinations. See, for example, U. P. Shah, "Astamafigala," Studies injaina Art, io9-Iz. 83</page><page sequence="6">Pictorial dydgapa.tas, on the other hand, are characterized by a large, main object or image, often flanked by worshippers, that fills most of the surface space of the plaque. The main object or image ofa pictorial dydgapata is sometimes a stnpa (fig. 26), cakra (fig. IO), or sthdpana (fig. 2), but it also may be a divinity (fig. 17), a monk (fig. 30), or aJina (fig. I5). Pictorial dydgapatas do not display the proliferation of detailed imagery and design organized in the abstract structure of concentric circles set within a square format as typifies the diagrammatic type. Instead they are more illustrative, with emphasis on a larger-scale object or figure of veneration. Regional Attribution and Sectarian Orientation ofAydgapa.tas All extant plaques that are termed dydgapa.ta in their inscriptions have been found in the region of Mathura.'s9 However, some evidence suggests that ayagapatas were used in regions other than Mathura, at sites such as Ahichhatra, KauSambi, and Amaravati. The Namdighosa ILyagapata (RBS J.686a, fig. 20), may have been discovered in Ahichhatra, about one hundred and fifty miles north- east of Mathura, but the circumstances surrounding its discovery are controversial at best.zo How- ever, it is carved in the Mathura red sandstone, which suggests that it was probably made in Mathura and exported to Ahichhatra.2- Another plaque, the Bhikhu Phagula Sild (Allahabad University Museum, fig. 6), though it is considered a buddhapdda, and hence not included in my list of twenty- eight dydgapa.tas, is very similar to the pictorial type of dydgapa.ta,z since the Buddha's footprints form the large, central worshipful element, and the border of the plaque is carved with decorative I9 Most of the dydgapa.tas from Mathura apparently have been found from the mound called Kafnkali-Tila; others have been discovered at sites known as Kathoti Kud, Chaubiapada-Tild, and Maholi. See Appendix. 2o There is conflicting evidence regarding the circumstances of the discovery of the Namdighosa Aya-gapata (Rajgir Bodh Sangrahalaya, Gorakhpur, J.686a). In a quote provided by Georg Bihler, Alfred Fdihrer reported he excavated this dydgapata from the ruins of a Buddhist vihara ("monastic quarters") in Ahichhatra. (See G. Biihler, "Specimens ofJaina Sculptures from Mathura," Epigraphia Indica II [I894], 314, footnote 8). Unfortunately Fiihrer's documen- tation has proved untrustworthy in a number of instances. (See H. Falk, The Discovery ofLumbini [Lumbini: Lumbini International Research Institute, 1998], esp. I3-15). Heinrich Liiders and Georg Bifhler, contradicting an earlier assertion, state that this dyagapata was found in Mathura at the Jaina stupa site of Kafnkali-Tila. (H. Liiders, "A List of Brahmi Inscriptions from the Earliest Times to About 400 A.D.," Epigraphia Indica X, Appendix [1912], no. 95, hereafter referred to as "Liiders' List"; G. Bibhler, "NewJaina Inscriptions from Mathura," Epigraphia Indica I [1892], 39, footnote 34.). V. A. Smith, however, does not include the Namdighosa Ayagapata in his otherwise apparently comprehensive compilation ofdydgapa.tas and other finds from Kifnkali-Til- (Smith, op. cit.). This omission suggests that the Namdighosa Aya~gapata may not have been from Kailkdli-Tild after all. In light of this confusion, it can only be concluded that the find-spot of the Narmdighosa Ayagapata, the discovery of which is shrouded in uncertainty, may be either Ahichhatra or Ki?kali-Tila. 21 A number of images were exported from Mathura to Ahichhatra during the Kusana Period, including a standing Bodhisattva Maitreya (NMD 59-530/1) and a seated kapardin type of Buddha dated to the Year 32 (NMD L.55-.25). R. C. Sharma, Buddhist Art, Mathura School (New Delhi: Wiley Eastern Ltd., 1995), figs. 94 and 88. zz22 G. R. Sharma identifies the Bhikhu Phagula ?ild as an aydgapa.ta. G. R. Sharma, History to Prehistory (Allahabad: Department of Ancient History, Culture, and Archaeology, University of Allahabad, 1980), 9-1o. Cf. A. Ghosh, "Buddhist Inscriptions from Kaudambi," Epigraphia Indica 34 (1960-6), 14-16. It seems that the dydgapa.tas and pddukd slabs are closely related types of objects, and in some instances, such as the case of the Bhikhu Phagula ilia, they are not appreciably distinct in fundamental form. To follow in Part II is a discussion of howpddukad slabs aid in our understanding of the symbolism and function of dydgapa.tas. 84</page><page sequence="7">mangalas, the remains of a nara-makara, 23 and other vegetal ornament. It was found at the site of the Buddhist Ghositarama Monasteryl4 near Kausambi, on the Yamuna River, about three hundred miles southeast of Mathura, and is made of the local, gray stone from the region of Kausambi rather than the red Mathura sandstone. Moreover, there is some epigraphical evidence which suggests that ayagapa.tas were in use in association with the Buddhist stzipa at Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh as well.2s5 Besides representing examples of daydgapa.tas from regions other than Mathura, the Namdighosa Ay-agapata, the Bhikhu Phagula Sila, and the epigraphs referring to cetiyapa.tas, cakapatas, and sothikapatas from Amaravati also provide evidence for the possible use of daydgapa.tas by Buddhists. However, the identification of the Bhikhu Phagula Sil- and thepatas from Amaravati as aydgapa.tas is not completely certain, nor is the identification of the N-mdighosa Ay-gapata as Buddhist.-6 Nevertheless, the possibility for the existence of Buddhist dydgapatas should remain open in light of the collective evidence supplied by the Namdighosa Aya-gapata, the Bhikhu Phagula Sild, and the Amaravati inscriptions. Moreover, some fragmentary dyagapa.tas from Mathura could be Buddhist in orientation, since the remaining motifs are common to both Buddhists and Jainas, but their frag- mentary nature makes it impossible to determine the religious tradition to which they originally belonged. Some indirect epigraphical evidence implies that that aydgapatas were used by Hindu sects. An inscription on a large stone slab from Mirjapur Village in Mathura (GMM 79.24) records the gift of fildpa.tas with the image of Sri, donated by the wife of Mulavasu, the Brahmin treasurer under Maha-ksatrapa Sodasa.27 The inscription states that filapa.tas were donated together with a tank, a gar- 23 A "nara-makara" is a composite creature with the head and torso of a man and bifurcate legs in the form of makaras (fish-tailed crocodilian creatures with serpentine bodies). This composite creature has also been called a mahoraga (or "great serpent"), but it is half makara, not half serpent. Therefore it seems more accurate to call this creature a nara- makara, a term found in the Aupapdtika-sitra (sitra 5), an early canonical SvetambaraJaina text, in a list of creatures carved upon stone slabs (fildpa.tas) set up in sacred spaces (caityas). Furthermore, these creatures are sometimes depicted with legs in the form of complete makaras (Chamunda-Tila Capital, GMM 72-7). 24 The Ghosita-rama monastery near Kausambi was apparently a major seat of the Mahasamghika sect of Buddhism. 25 Three different inscriptions from Amaravati mention the dedication of a plaque with a wheel (cakapata), plaques with a svastika (sothikapa.ta), and a plaque possibly with a stupa on it (cetiyapa.ta). For the relevant Amaravati inscrip- tions see Ltiders' List Numbers I253, 1287, and I225, respectively. See also van Lohuizen-de Leeuw, I15; Agrawala, Indian Art, 232-33; and Sengupta, 23-29. Unfortunately, we cannot be sure that these various "patas" mentioned in the Amaravati inscriptions are the same type of object as the dydgapa.tas from Mathura, for we do not know to what they refer. They may simply refer to drum slabs carrying images ofcakras or caityas, of which there are many at Ama- ravati, and these drum slabs are distinct from dydgapatas. 26 There is no sectarian-specific element on the Namdighosa Aya-gapata, since the central figure is missing (fig. 20). It is interesting to note, however, that its inscription (Appendix no. xi) does not contain the usual formulaic invoca- tion to the arhats that is found on Jaina dydgapatas. Furthermore, the endless knot symbol is incorporated into the grapevine at the upper median side of the plaque - a symbol that is not found on any of the Jaina dydgapa.tas, but is seen on the Buddhist Bhikhu Phagula Sila (fig. 6). Aside from the purported find-spot of the Namdighosa Aya-gapata (see footnote 20 above), these are the only shreds of evidence that indicate its possible Buddhist orientation. 27 The Mirjapur stele inscription reads as follows: I. svamisya mahdksatrapasya Slumddsasya gdamjavarasya brdhmanasya 2. Segravasagotrasya mflavasusya bhdryaye vasusya matare 85</page><page sequence="8">den, an assembly hall, a well, and a pillar, which items apparently were associated with a temple com- plex. Since the broader term ildpa.ta ("stone plaque") was sometimes used as a synonym for the term ayagapa.ta,28 this inscription could mean that aydgapa.tas carved with the image of Sri Laksmi were gifted to a temple, which was probably of a Hindu denomination, since the donor was the wife of a Brahmin. Furthermore, a similar, but fragmentary, inscription from Jam-lpur-Til- in Mathura records the gift of a fildpata along with other temple accouterments by the Brahmin Malavasu him- self, but the portion of the inscription identifying the image on the Sildpa.ta is lost.29 Another inscrip- tion from Mathura records the dedication of a jildpa.ta and other elements of a temple complex by Kulxta in the context of devotion to Siva.30 Although the actual plaques referred to in the Mirjapur, Jam-lpur, and Kul-ta inscriptions have not been discovered or identified, these three inscriptions contain evidence for the possible establishment offildpatas by followers of Hindu religious traditions in the context of a temple setting for the sake of honoring and worshipping deities such as Sri Laksmi or Siva. It is also possible that aydgapatas were used in connection with the popular worship of nature divinities, including yaksas and ndgas. The early Jaina canonical text, the Aupapdtika-sutra, refers to 3. kauSiklye pdksakdye kdaritd puskarini imasim yamada pu - 4. skaranindrm purva puskarani dramo sabhd udapdnad stambho firiye prati[md] 5. ye lildpatd ca Translation: "Kausiki Pa-ksaka, mother of Vasu and wife of Malavasu, treasurer ofSvami Mahaksatrapa Sumdrsa (Sodasa) and a Brahmin belonging to the Segrava gotra, caused the eastern of the twin tanks, a garden, an assembly hall, a well, a pillar, and stone slabs with the image of Sri to be made." Since this inscription records donations made during the time of the treasurer of Svami Mahaksatrapa Sodasa, it is datable to the first two or three decades of the first century A.D. Arguments for this dating of Sod.sa are given below in footnote 90. Cf. a transcription, translation, and interpretation of the Mirjapur inscription in R. C. Sharma, "New Inscriptions from Mathura," in Mathura: The Cultural Heritage (1989), 308 ff. In the Namdighosa Ayagapata inscription (Appendix, no. xi), multiple dydgapa.tas are recorded to have been donated, so the Mirj*apur inscription is not unique in its dedication of more than one plaque. See also the Amaravati inscription (Ltiders' List no. 1287) that records the donation of multiplepa.tas carved with svastikas. 28 The Sivayaa Aya-gapata (SMLJ.255, Appendix no. xxii, fig. 27) is called "dydgapa.ta" in its inscription, while the Vasu Silapata (GMM Q.2, Appendix no. iii, fig. 26), which is of the same form and with the same type of carving as the Sivayasa Ay-agapata, is called a "iildpata" in its inscription. Therefore, it appears that dydgapatas could be called either by this more specific name or by the more general term Sildpata. V. N. Srivastava equates the term Sildpa.ta with dydgapa.ta, but without offering an explanation. V. N.

Sircar suggests that the broken part of the Jamailpur inscription may have originally included a reference to the image of Vasudeva, instead of his consort Sri, whose image is mentioned in the Mirj*apur inscrip- tion, since the former was dedicated by the Brahmin M-lavasu and the latter by his wife Paksak-a.

The known stone plaques that are identified specifically as dyagapatas are Jaina in sectarian ori- entation, since they are carved with images ofJaina tirthankaras (also "Jinas"), nudeJaina monks (fig. 19), or they have inscriptions which invoke the "arhats,")) which at that time referred toJinas, the lib- erated beings of the Jaina religion (see Appendix). However, it must be remembered that the largest fraction of the surviving aydgapatas were apparently discovered from the one Jaina site of Knrika- li-ila. We must be aware that that the future discovery of sites affiliated with other sects may yield non-Jaina dydgapa.tas, since, as we have seen, some evidence implies that dyagapatas may have been used by the followers of a number of religious traditions. Original Context, Donors, and Chronological Parameters of Aydgapa.tas Since the aydgapa.tas do not evince traces of mortises, tenons, or slats, and since most of their carv- ings extend to the edges of their surfaces, it seems that they were neither free-standing like steles, nor clamped or inserted into supports with slats. Hence, it seems that they were either built into a vertical wall,33 or, most probably, they were displayed horizontally, placed flat upon a pedestal. A bas relief carved in the spandrel of a tympanum dating to the early first century A.D. (NMD J.555, fig. I) depicts abbreviated representations of diagrammatic dydgapa.tas lying flat upon pedestals 31 Aupapatika-sitra, sItras 2-5, 2nd ed., (Bombay: Agamodaya Samiti, I916), Io-II. See also Shah, Studies inJaina Art, 67-70 and 83. V.S. Agrawala specifically states that dydgapa.tas were originally placed upon pedestals and used in the worship of yaksas. See V. S. Agrawala, Prdcina Bhdratitya Lokadharma, Jfianodaya Granthamala- Series, No. 3 (1964), I30. 32 This inscription, carved on a large sandstone slab, was found at Jamalpur-Til-a and is now in the State Museum, Luck- now. That such a lengthy inscription records solely the installation of a fildpata in a shrine (sthdne) points to the importance of the Sildpa.ta as an object of worship within a sacred precinct. It probably dates to the late second cen- tury A.D., given the late-Kusana paleography and epigraphic conventions. For an impression, transcription and translation of the inscription see G. Blihler, "New Jaina Inscriptions from Mathura," Epigraphia Indica I (1892), 390, No. XVIII; and Ltiders' List, no. 85. 33 The Nra-yana Vataka inscription from Ghosdndi in R-jasthan, dating to around the first century B.C. might indi- cate that stone slabs similar to dyagapa.tas were inset into a wall, since the inscription contains the phrase "pajda Sild prdkdro." See Ltiders' List No. 6; and D. C. Sircar Select Inscriptions Bearing on Indian History and Civilization, I (Cal- cutta: University of Calcutta, 1965), 90, no. 3. It is also possible that they were set horizontally into the ground, as the edges of many dydgapa.tas are only roughly finished. Round metal plaques, called manda in Newari, are inset into the ground next to Buddhist stipas in Nepal, and they are used in Newari Buddhist ritual contexts to this day. (This information was conveyed via e- mail from Gautama Vajracharya of the University of Wisconsin on November 27 and 30, I998.) These modern mandala plaques may represent distant echoes of the dydgapatas, which seem to have been set up outside of stipas as well, as seen in the tympanum spandrel in the National Museum, New Delhi (fig. i). 34 V. S. Agrawala and Debala Mitra also have associated these bas relief representations in the tympanum spandrel in the National Museum with dydgapa.tas. See Agrawala, Indian Art, 231; and Mitra, op. cit., 64. 87</page><page sequence="10">next to a stufpa.34 They can be identified as dydgapa.tas by the quadruple w-shaped nandyavartas sur- rounding concentric circular elements, seen clearly in the leftmost representation.35 Also, they have two beaded borders which may represent the rows of marigalas often found on dydgapa.tas (see for example fig. 22). Since the reverse sides ofdydgapa.tas originally seem to have been uncarved, and since many were meant to be viewed from more than one direction,36 we shall conclude that diagrammatic dyagapa.tas were probably placed horizontally in this manner. As such they could be venerated by cir- cumambulation. The pictorial dydgapa.tas were also likely to have been set up in a similar manner, since some of them were intended to be viewed from more than one direction (fig. 2). However, since some of the pictorial types, such as the Amohini Ayavati (fig. 17) and the Vasu Silapata (fig. 26) are so vertical in presentation and visually oriented to only one direction, we cannot dismiss the possi- bility that some were set up vertically, perhaps built into a wall, though currently there is no con- clusive evidence to confirm this possibility.37 The tympanum spandrel, which shows dyagapa.tas laid horizontally upon pedestals, also depicts them in association with aJaina stupa precinct (fig. I).38 In addition to the visual evidence in the tym- panum spandrel and the archaeological report stating that many of the dydgapatas were discovered at a vihdra or at a monastic complex such as Kafikali-Tila,39 epigraphical clues also provide indications concerning the original contexts in which they were set up. A number of inscriptions refer to loca- tions that may have been the places where dydgapa.tas were installed. The inscription on the Vasu Silapata (Appendix no. iii) records the installation of the stone plaque (ildpa.ta) within the sanctu- ary (dydtane) of the Nirgrantha arhats together with a shrine (devikula), an assembly hall for worship (dydgasabhd), and a tank (prapd). As we noted above, the Dadhikarnna inscription states that the lildpata was set up within a shrine (sthdne), and the Mirjapur, Jamalpur, and Kul-ta inscriptions record the installation offildpatas within what seems to have been Hindu temple complexes.40 Fur- thermore, a fragmentary inscription in the Indian Museum, Calcutta (N.S. 6482) refers to the set- 35 Sadashiv Gorakshakar considered these objects to be carpets laid over empty seats. The Peaceful Liberators:]ain Art fromn India, ed. Pratapaditya Pal (Los Angeles, 1994), 103. The other representations of empty seats from this date, however, generally are shown with back rests. 36 Sometimes the inscription is meant to be read from one direction, while the subject matter of the carving is oriented to another, as, for example, in fig. 2. In other examples, the relief carvings are oriented to two opposite directions (fig. 22), or they are about equally viewable from all directions (fig. I4). 37 When the Vasu Silapata was discovered, it had been reused by being built into the wall of the Holi Gate at Mathura. See Smith, op. cit., 61, pl. CIII. 38 The remains of a Jaina ardhaphdlaka monk are visible at the broken left side in the middle register of the tympa- num. Moreover, the alignment of deities in the center, with the female deity in the center of the bottom register concurs with the figures on an identifiably Jaina tympanum of the Kusana Period in the State Museum, Lucknow (B.zo7). (See Srivastava, op. cit., fig. 4.) Hence, along with its purported find-spot at the Jaina stzupa site of Kanikali- Tila, the combined evidence favors aJaina affiliation for this tympanum. 39 Smith, op. cit. 1-4. Alfred Flihrer conducted the original excavations at Kaflikali-Tila, but, as noted above (footnote 20) his reports have proven to be untrustworthy, and the attributions of objects in the State Museum, Lucknow to Kafkali-Tifla cannot all be confirmed. 40 See above footnotes 27 and 29. 41 Like the Mirjapur and Jamalpur stele inscriptions, this inscription is dated to the time of Mahaksatrapa Sodasa.

This inscription suggests that the plaque was found in aJaina monas- tic complex, which, as we know from the intact Western Indian cave temples, could include small shrines with sacred objects or images. The place name in the Nramdighosa Ayagapata inscription (Appendix no. xi) is more difficult to interpret, for it mentions that multiple dydgapa.tas were "set up in a bhamdira." Unfortunately, the meaning of bhamdira is unclear; it might be the name of a park in Mathura,41 which perhaps could include a temple or shrine that was provided with a number of these plaques as their objects of worship, but this interpretation is uncertain. Viewed collectively, the evidence from the bas relief in the tympanum spandrel (fig. I) and from these various inscrip- tions suggests that dydgapa.tas were set up horizontally upon pedestals in sacred precincts, be they temple sanctuaries, stupa complexes, or monasteries. The inscriptions on the dydgapa.tas indicate that they were caused to be set up by lay people from various occupations, including actors, goldsmiths, and courtesans along with their families. Only the Bhikhu Phagula Sila was donated by a Buddhist monk. (For a list of the donors' names and occu- pations, see the end of the Appendix.) The majority of the donors were women. Among the fifteen dydgapa.tas in whose inscriptions the donor's name or gender-indicative attribute (such as wife or daughter) survive, eleven were donated by women,43 while only four were given by men.44 Almost all of the Jaina ayagapa.tas are inscribed with the phrase arahata pujdye, indicating that they were set up for the sake of worshipping or honoring the arhats (meaningJinas), while the Bhikhu Phagula Sil- states that it was established for the sake of worshipping all the Buddhas (budhdndm pujaye). Thus, as was suggested earlier in the discussion on the meaning of the epithet "dydgapa.ta," these plaques appear to have been objects of worship that probably formed part of the repertoire of sacred objects within a monastic or temple setting, and they were donated by various members of the lay community. As for the time period during which dydgapa.tas were made, scholars in the past generally have considered them all to be roughly contemporaneous, but no precise dating or chronology of the aya- gapa.tas has been offered. In Part III below, I will present a summary of my arguments for a relative chronology of the dydgapa.tas, but at this juncture I will simply provide the temporal parameters within which dydgapa.tas seem to have been produced. Sculptural and epigraphical evidence attest that they date as early as the mid-second century B.c., thus coinciding with the advent of surviving stone sculptural production in Mathura. This date for the oldest stone dydgapa.tas could suggest, as line is clearly only to the right of the -da- aksara, giving the reading de. However, prasddo would not be problem- atic; instead it would mean that the lildpata was set up with the temple rather than in the temple. 42 See Theo. Damsteegt, Epigraphical Hybrid Sanskrit (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1978), 254. This interpretation ofbhamdira in the Namdighosa AIyagapata inscription further complicates the attribution of this plaque either to Kafikali-Tila or to Ahichhatra. Another interpretation of bhamdira is that it refers to a "treasury" or "storehouse," given the similar- ity of the word with the Sanskrit bhdanddra, but this phonetic shift is improbable. See the discussion in the Appen- dix, no. xi. 43 Appendix nos. iii, x, xv, xvi, xviii, xx, xxii, xxiii, xxv, xxvi, and xxviii record female donors. 44 Appendix nos. ix, xi, xvii, and xix record male donors. 89</page><page sequence="12">is the case with other lithic objects and architectural pieces, that the stone sculpture tradition begin- ning in the mid-second century B.c. at Mathura represents the continuation of a pre-existing sculp- tural tradition in perishable materials such as wood or clay. Thus, the history of the production of dydgapatas may have extended for an indeterminate time prior to the second century B.c. when they apparently began to be carved in stone. The latest among this group of twenty-eight dyagapatas can be attributed to the beginning of the third century A.D.; the Kana Plaque, for example, is dated to the Year 99, probably in a Kusana era (SML J.623, Appendix no. xxviii, fig. 30), and it displays the emphasis on the iconic figural tra- dition of that period. Although it is true that the majority of the surviving dydgapatas date to the period between the mid-first century B.C. to the end of the first century A.D., the production ofaya- gapatas spanned at least four centuries. It apparently waned, however, during the early and middle Kus-na period, a phenomenon that may best be explained by the escalating interest in three-dimen- sional anthropomorphic iconic imagery in the early second century A.D. PART II Symbolism and Function In this section I shall present an interpretation of the relief carvings first of the diagrammatic types of dydgapatas followed by that of the pictorial types. The proposed interpretation of their imagery leads to a further understanding of the likely function that both kinds of dydgapa.tas served, proba- bly in the context of devotional practice. Although the types of imagery found on diagrammatic and pictorial dydgapa.tas seem to differ significantly, they nevertheless could have served similar purposes - the former apparently functioning on a more esoteric level than the latter. Diagrammatic Aydgapa.tas Since we lack textual or epigraphical records that specifically explicate the meaning and function of daydgapa.tas, we must look to other sources and to the more well-known meanings of analogous types of objects for assistance in interpreting the complex imagery on dydgapa.tas. Diagrammatic dydgapa.tas share a number of traits with early carved stone chatras ("umbrellas" or "parasols"), in that they both have a central circular focal element, surrounded by maigalas, vegetal ornament, and animals, both real and mythical (fig. 33). Moreover, while most are circular, a number of stone chatras and indi- vidual canopies are square in format, like dydgapa.tas.45 Hence, an investigation of the significance of early stone chatras from Mathura and the variegated imagery found thereon may shed some light on the meaning of the dyagapa.tas. In his exegetical article entitled "Usnisa and Chatra," A. K. Coomaraswamy insightfully explained the profound significance of the chatra in ancient India by drawing upon references found in numerous textual sources of the Vedic tradition, and much of the following discussion of chatras is based on his conclusions.46 45 See for example the squLiare canopy GMM 76.I2 in R. C. Sharma, The Splendour of Mathura, Art and Museum (New Delhi: D.K. Print World, 1993), fig. 40. 46 A. K. Coomaraswamy, "Usnisa and Chatra," The Poona Orientalist III (I938), I-19. 90</page><page sequence="13">Chatras, which are emblematic of divinity or kingship, carry symbolism which is deeply rooted in the Vedic tradition and is explicated in the Vedas and the Upanisads.47 The umbrella of a Uni- versal Man - a Buddha, Jina, or cakravartin - contrasts to a parasol or umbrella used by an ordinary person in that it functions more as a nimbus; it represents the emanation of light of the liberated being, deity, or king, rather than serving as a protection from sun or rain.48 Therefore, the solar sym- bol of the full-blown lotus is carved in the center of every chatra, and the spokes of the chatra ema- nating from the central lotus represent the sun's rays (fig. 33).49 The chatra as a whole represents the domical roof of the world, which is pierced at the center by a pillar, the axis mundi, that simultane- ously connects and separates the heavens and the earth. This pillar is analogous to the staff of the umbrella.5o The high-noon sun, represented by the full-blown lotus at the center of the chatra, is located at the apex of the dome, at the point of penetration by the pillar. Above the sun, beyond the domical roof of the world sit the arhats, or literally "qualified, enlightened persons," in meditative equipoise, in a paradise that is devoid of the bonds and suffering of mundane existence. Thejaim- inTya Upani.ad Brdhmana (I.6.I) states that one who hopes for salvation must pass through the sun to the realm of immortality above the dome, and if he does so, then he is "qualified," i.e. an arhat.55 The sun, which is the light of truth, is the door through which only the enlightened may penetrate.5 47 Although the extant diagrammatic dyagapatas are Jaina in orientation, the Jaina tradition stems from Vedic sources, and it retained, assimilated, and translated many essential Vedic conceptions. As A. K. Coomaraswamy maintained, Jaina art - along with the art and iconography of any Indian religious tradition - cannot be profoundly understood or ultimately explained without considering their roots in the Vedic metaphysical tradition. See A.K. Coomaraswamy, "'The Conqueror's Life' in Jaina Painting: Explicitur Reductio Haec Artis Ad Theologiam,"Jfour- nal of the Indian Society of Oriental Art III (December I935), I28 and I44. I found the Vedic sources elucidated by A.K. Coomaraswamy to be more relevant than extant Jaina texts for understanding the imagery on diagrammatic dyagapa.tas. The earliest known Jaina texts significantly postdate most of the dydgapa.tas by at least several hundred years, and their descriptions involve imagery not reflected in the carv- ings of the dydgapa.tas. Furthermore, the early Jaina texts that describe the realms of liberation and other cosmolog- ical aspects belong to the canonical Svetambara Jaina tradition rather than the pre-schismatic, unorthodox Ard- haphdlaka sect, which was apparently the sole sect ofJaina monks active at Mathura during the second century B.C. to first century A.D., when most of the knownJaina dydgapatas were produced. We should not impose all later canon- ical Svetambara ideals onto imagery made for the Ardhaphalaka Jains, unless there is evidence that they were espoused. The Ardhaphalaks seem to have adopted a number of Brahmanical practices and ideals, including, per- haps, aspects of cosmology that are reflected in the imagery of the dydgapa.tas, which may further justify my use of Vedic sources for their explication. For a further discussion of the Ardhaphalaka sect in pre-Kusana Mathura and their apparent assimilation of Brahmanical practices and ideals, see my "Closer to Heaven than the Gods:Jain Monks in the Art of Pre-Kushan Mathura," Marg, March 200ool. 48 Coomaraswamy, "Usnisa and Chatra," 5. 49 The ribs or "rays" of the chatra are called raimivatim, or "possessing beams of light or splendor" (Vdijasaneyi Samhitd, XV.63). 5o The Datakumdracarita contains the phrase "brahmanda-chatra-dan'da," or "staff of the umbrella of the Brahma-egg; the Brahma-egg refers to the universe. See Coomaraswamy, "Usnisa and Chatra," 6, footnote I. 51 "If it be so, if he is qualified (arhat), then'when he has reached the full term of life (sarvam dyus eti)... (sic) ascending these worlds... (sic) he escapes through the midst of the Sun (ddityam samaydtimucyate); that is the hole of the sky (divas chidram); verily like the hole in a cart or chariot-wheel, even so is the hole of the sky; it is all covered up by rays (raSmibhih samchannam)." Coomaraswamy, "Usnisa and Chatra," 12. 52 See thejaiminlya Upanisad Brdhmana I.5.3, III.I4.3, and IV.I5.2, and the Chdndogya Upanisad, VI,8.5. 91</page><page sequence="14">This arcane Vedic conception of the symbolism of the chatra as the dome of the sky and the world view in which the arhat sits at the ocular apex of the dome, beyond the sun-gate, seems to form the basis for the Jaina conception of the liberated beings, arhats or Jinas, who sit in meditative equipoise at the apex of heaven, free of the trammels of the universe. The Jaina diagrammatic dyagapatas may visually represent this worldview.53 A full-blown lotus flower is carved in the center of the Okarana Ay-gapata (fig. 3), and it, like the central lotus of the chatra, may be understood as a representation of the sun atop the axis mundi at the ocular apex of the dome of the sky. Similarly, the wheel in the center of the Cakra Ayagapata of Matharaka serves as an another solar symbol (fig. 14).54 The central circle on the Fishtail Svastika Ayagapata of Dhanamitra (fig. 13) depicts not only a full-blown lotus in the central circle, but also an arhat, or Jina, seated in meditation, superimposed over the lotus. This arrangement visually seems to depict the liberated being seated in the immortal realm above the dome's perforation, beyond the sun at the top of the axis mundi pillar. Thus, the dia- grammatic dydgapa.tas may be interpreted as two-dimensional visual representations of the dome of the sky, with the mandatory central circle depicting either the sun itself in the form of a lotus, or the arhat who sits directly above the high-noon sun in the realm of immortality - the place that the Jaina worshipper or practitioner wishes to attain by becoming "qualified" (arhat) through following the teachings of the Jinas.55 Most of the diagrammatic dydgapa.tas have nandydvartas, usually four in number, immediately surrounding the central circle. In certain contexts, a nandydvarta placed upon a full-blown lotus flower (hereafter called the "nandydvarta-and-lotus symbol") can be understood as a symbolic repre- sentation of the sacred presence of either a Jina or a Buddha, particularly when it is depicted upon a pedestal under worship, or when it stands in for the image or figure of a Jina or Buddha in a narra- tive or devotional scene (fig. 32). If, as on the Okarana Ayagapata (fig. 3), the central circle of a diagrammatic dydgapa.ta is formed by a lotus flower, then each of the four abutting nandydvartas com- bines with it to form a complete nandydvarta-and-lotus symbol that can itself be a non-figurative representation of the arhat. On an dydgapa.ta like the Sihanamdika Ayagapata (fig. 21), the central circle contains the image of the arhat himself (in lieu of the shrouding sun in the form of a lotus) and the four nandydvartas share the central circle as a base. These four nandydvartas combine with the arhat rather than a lotus, thus both symbolically and iconically seeming to render the Jina's presence fac- ing out to each of the four directions. The only difference between revealing aJina rather than a lotus in the central circle is that the former depicts the liberated being beyond the sun, while the latter depicts the concealing sun itself, as is seen on chatras. Both, as we have noted, are conceived as aligned 53 Since all the surviving diagrammatic aydgapatas appear to be Jaina in sectarian orientation, the current discussion focuses on the interpretation of their carvings within a Jaina cosmological context. 54 See footnote 5I. 55 Alexander Soper briefly discussed one ayagapata in terms of the dome of heaven, but he attributed its form to an adaptation of western Christian ceilings and concepts of the dome of heaven and did not consider the concepts of the Vedic tradition, which are fundamentally distinct in meaning. Alexander Coburn Soper, "The 'Dome of Heaven' in Asia," Art Bulletin XXIX, no. I (March 1947), 226-27, fig. I. 92</page><page sequence="15">on the same axis; therefore it is consistent with the diagram of the dome of the sky to have either the sun or the arhat depicted in the central circle.56 The nandydvarta may allude to the teachings or doctrines expounded by the arhat, in particular the "three jewels" of dharma, namely true insight (samyak-darsana), right knowledge (samyak-jdana), and proper conduct (samyak-cdrita).57 Hence, the quadruple nandydvarta-and-lotus/ larhat symbols on the diagrammatic dyadgapa.tas can be understood to refer to the emanation of the presence of the arhat through his teachings into the four directions of the universe.58 A number ofJaina texts refer to the samavasarana ofaJina, explicitly stating that celestial beings and both real and mythical creatures assemble to hear the teachings of the Jina, who is simultane- ously visible from all four directions.59 This description resonates with the carvings on the dydgapa.tas, for each of the four nandydivartas simultaneously faces the four directions as aniconic representations of the same arhat who is depicted in the shared central circle. Furthermore, most of the diagrammatic 56 The nandydvarta symbol can also be understood as being a two-dimensional representation of half of a vajra, which consists of a central pillar, like a sacrificial post, surrounded by four or eight prongs that meet from all directions at a common center. Thus, the nandydvarta symbol implies multi-directionality from a single central pillar, which may be rendered two-dimensionally as a full-blown lotus, since the axis mundi pillar pierces the apex of the sky at the point of the high-noon sun. See A. K. Coomaraswamy, Elements of Buddhist Iconography (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, I935), 14-15, 67 footnotes 23-24. 57 A. K. Coomaraswamy, "Notes on Indian Coins and Symbols," Ostasiatische Zeitschrift (1927/28), 180; and Padman- abh S. Jaini,jaina Path of Purification (Berkeley: University of California Press, I979), 200oo. 58 The Koliya Gana Ayagapata (GMM 2o-21.16o03) represents a unique exception among the diagrammatic ayadgapa.tas (fig. 31). Its central circle contains a stipa. Connecting the central circle to the corners of the plaque are two nandyd- varta-and-lotus motifs combined with a honeysuckle; the nandydvartas point in toward the central circle rather than away from it. A seated figure of a Jina in dhyadna-mudrd connects the inner circle to the median edge of the plaque. Considering the breaks at the bottom broken edge of the plaque, it is probable that there was a similar Jina figure surrounding the central circle in each of the four directions. Compared to the carvings on all the other extant dia- grammatic ayagapatas, those on the Koliya Gana Aya-gapata seem to be inverted. The nandydvartas face in rather than out, and the outer Jina figures are oriented with their heads facing the edge of the plaque rather than the cen- tral circle as does the Jina figure in the outer ring of the Fishtail Svastika Ayagapata (fig. 13) and the British Museum Aya-gapata (fig. 37). Further it has a stipa is in the center with Jinas outside the center, instead of the converse (fig. 13). The stfipa in the center can also refer to the axis mundi, as the stipa also is penetrated through its center by a sym- bolic pillar, the top of which emerges out of the apex of the dome of the stipa. The Ko!iya Gana Ayagapata may rep- resent a later development in Jainism at Mathura, for it seems to date to around the third century A.D., about two hundred years later than the other diagrammatic types. It does, however, demonstrate that the tradition of carving diagrammatic dyagapatas continued up to this late date. The imagery on this unusual dydgapa.ta recalls the sarvato- bhadrikd images popular during the mid to late Kusaga period, wherein four seated or standing Jinas are arranged around a central pillar topped by a chatra. The stiSpa in the center of the Ko!iya Gana Ay-agapata can refer to both a pillar and to the presence of the Jina, but the carvings on this plaque seem to emphasize a connection between the Jinas in the four directions and the central stapa rather than emanation from the center. 59 Samavasarana, which literally means "assembly," refers to the crucial event in the life of every Jina wherein gods, fantastic creatures, and other beings gather in a celestial temple setting to listen to the Jina's teachings. Descrip- tions of samavasaranas are found in numerous Jaina texts, including the Trisas.tisaldkdpurusacarita of Hemacandra, parva I, sarga 3, vv. 422zz ff., GOS. Vol. LI, 190 ff. and 334 ff.; the Mahdpurdana (or Adipurdana) 22.76-312; the Rdya- paseniya-sitra, R. C. Sharma, "Art Data in Rayapaseniya," in Bulletin of Museums and Archaeology in U.P. IX (I972), 38-44; and many others. For other references see U.P. Shah, Studies injaina Art, 85, footnote 5. 93</page><page sequence="16">aydgapa.tas include representations of celestial beings in postures of worship in the outer rings (figs. 13, 14, and 23 for example) and real and mythical creatures along the borders (see figs. 3, 9, Io, 14, and 18). The large curved svastika that is found on some dyagapatas - either springing directly from the central circle (fig. II) or from the second concentric circle containing the four nandydvartas (figs. 13 and 24) - may indicate that the realms depicted outside of the central circle are within the world of birth, death and rebirth. In the Jaina context the svastika can be symbolic ofsamsdara or cyclical exis- tence, the four arms denoting the four possible types of births within samsadra.60 Thus, in a diagram- matic dyagapata like the Fishtail Svastika Ay-gapata of Dhanamitra (fig. 13), only the central circle represents the immortal region of liberated beings, while the remainder of the diagram refers to the universe, the realm of samsdra. The outermost concentric ring of some dyagapatas, such as the Fishtail Svastika Ayagapata of Dhanamitra (fig. 13) and the Chaubiapada- Ay-gapata (fig. 23), contains flying celestial beings, both male and female, in the act of venerating various objects of worship, including a stipa, a caitya-vrksa, an image of the tirthadfkara, a nandydvarta-and-lotus symbol, and a stylized throne (bhadrdsana). These symbols are found at the median of each side of the dydgapata at the point of contact between the outermost ring and the square frame, and they are also aligned with the central prong of each of the four nandydvartas. As some Vedic sources imply, heavenly realms are viewed as being circular or domical, while the earth is understood as being square.61 Hence, the inner circular sections of dia- grammatic dydgapa.tas may be interpreted as depicting the heavens, while the outer square frame may represent terrafirma. Thus, each of the sacred symbols under worship by the celestials may be viewed as the various embodiments of the presence of the arhat that are found in the world, both in celestial and earthly realms, since they are located at the meeting-point of the circle and the square. The dharma and the sacred presence of the arhat, who exists in the immortal realm of the central circle, emanate from the center into the four directions, as indicated by the nandydvartas. They are then reified or embodied in various forms, such as the stfpa and the caitya-vrksa, that are available to gods and men - beings within samsdara - for veneration. The spandrels of several diagrammatic dyagapatas comprise composite atlantean creatures, called nara-makaras or nari-makaras, supporting the circular elements (figs. 13-14, 23-24). They have either a male or female torso, and fin or rodent-like ears with bifurcate serpentine legs that end in fish-tails. They represent the waters of the cosmic ocean on which the metaphoric "hut" of the world floats and It must be understood that the complete descriptions of samavasarana scenes significantly post-date the dya- gapatas, and only some fundamental ideas regarding the samavasaranas may be germane to an interpretation of the carvings on dyagapatas, since the notion of the Jina's samavasarana is likely to be of considerable antiquity. The concept of the samavasarana has been related to the meaning of dydgapatas in recent years by some schol- ars, but they do not explain exactly how the samavasarana is manifested in the carvings on the plaques. See Jaini, The jaina Path of Purification, I92; and Stephen Markel, in P. Pal, The Peaceful Liberators:Jain Artfrom India, II9. 60 The four samsaric destinies, or "gatis," refer to births as gods (devas), humans (manusyas), hell beings (ndraki), and animals and plants (tirya#ca). See Jaini,Jaina Path ofPuriJfication, O108 and zoo. 61 In Vedic literature the roof of the metaphorical cosmic hut, box or chariot, equivalent to the sky, is sometimes con- sidered to be circular while the floor, or the earth is square. See the Rg Veda, VIII, zo.8 and Coomaraswamy, "Usnisa and Chatra," 16. 94</page><page sequence="17">is supported. Their posture evocatively depicts them supporting the dome of the sky with their heads, hands and coiled tails. A number of diagrammatic dyagapa.tas have fewer concentric circular elements, such as the Sihana-mdika Ayagapata (fig. 2I) and the Acala Ayagapata (fig. 22); instead they have figures or sym- bols arranged in a square format around the quadruple nandydvartas. In this type of dydgapa.ta, the top and bottom borders are filled with mangalas, while a depiction of a composite pillar (stambha) is carved in the left and right borders. Since the mangalas and the stambhas are placed within a square format, they may be understood as elements found in the world, since the square sections of the plaques seem to be indicative of the earth, as noted above. Stambhas are often set up outside the gate- ways or vedikds of stupas, marking the location of the sacred site, just as the lion pillar of A'oka was erected in front of the southern gateway at the Buddhist Stupa I at Sanchi, for example. The Sihanamdika and Acala Ayagapatas both have one pillar that is topped with a cakra, which probably represents the wheel of the dharma propagated in the world by the teachings of the Jina. The other pillar on these dydgapatas is topped by an elephant, in the case of the Sihanamdika Ayagapata, and by a seated lion, in the case of the Acala Ayagapata. These animals may be identified as the cognizance of the individual Jina who is depicted in the center, the elephant being the standard of Ajitanatha, while the lion refers to Mahavira.6- Aydgapatas like the Sihanamdika Ayagapata and the Acala Aya-gapata seem to portray a variation of the two-dimensional diagram of the domical roof of the world, but they exclude the scenes of worship by the celestials, and instead place greater emphasis on the auspicious symbols and markers found in the earthly world, such as the astamarigalas and stambhas. Some diagrammatic dydgapa.tas are simpler, such as the Okarana Ayagapata (fig. 3) and the Shimla Museum Ayagapata63 (fig. 9), which have the central circular element surrounded by the four nandyd- vartas, with lilies or honeysuckle motifs in the interstices, and a wide square border filled with cir- cumambulating animals, such as a bull, winged lion, rhinoceros, winged horse, and winged dragon. The appearance of these animals recalls the assembly of animals at the samavasarana ofaJina, as noted above. They are also much like the animals that are often carved on the coping stones (usliisas) of 62 The inscriptions on neither of these two dyagapa.tas identify the specific Jina who is seated in the center. However, the Vasu Silapata, which also has a pillar surmounted by a seated lion (fig. 26), much like the one in the Acala Ayagapata (fig. 22), has an inscription that specifically invokes Mahavira, whose cognizance is the lion (Appendix no. iii). Hence, the animal capitals on such pillars may in fact be related to the animal symbols of the individual Jinas, just as the animal cognizance of the particular Jina was carved on the pedestal of tirthankara images in later periods. 63 N. P. Joshi conjectured that the Shimla Museum Ayagapata, which is fragmentary, originally had a large curving svastika, similar to the Fishtail Svastika Ayagapata of Dhanamitra ("Early Jaina Icons from Mathura," fig. 34.2). However, the positioning of the remaining fish-tails, two of which are pointing towards the honeysuckle motif in the corner, indicate that they are the ends of nandyavartas rather than the curving arms of a svastika. Also, the hon- eysuckle motif itself, which points towards a corner with a rounded bar for a base is of the same type as those found in the corners of other dydgapatas that have quadruple nandydvartas surrounding the central circle, such as the Sihanamdika Aya-gapata (fig. 21), the Acala Ayagapata (fig. 22) and the Namdighosa Ayagapata (fig. 20). Unlike the nandydvartas in these three aydgapatas, however, the fishtails of the nandydvartas on the Shimla Museum Ayagapata seem to point out rather than forward. This outward pointing of the ends of nandydvartas is seen in the makara-shaped nandydvartas on the Chaubiapada Aydgapata (fig. 23). 95</page><page sequence="18">vedikds that surround stupas or other caityas, such as those found at the Buddhist establishments of Bharhut, Bodhgaya, and Amaravati. Thus, the central part of these simpler dydgapa.tas can be under- stood as the dome of the sky, analogous to the dome of a stupa, while the outer square edge with cir- cumambulating animals may be analogous to the vedikad surrounding a stupa, which demarcates the sacred from the mundane world. Despite their numerous variations, the diagrammatic dyagapatas all have centrally-placed circu- lar elements set within a square framework with carved imagery that can be understood in terms of a cosmological diagram of the domical roof of the world. The central circle always contains a repre- sentation either of the sun, in the form of a full-blown lotus or a sixteen-spoked chakra, or of the arhat, who sits beyond but directly above the high-noon sun in the liberated realm of immortality. The presence of the arhat is seen to emanate out from the center as seen in the nandydvartas that face the four directions, found on nearly all diagrammatic dydgapatas, along with various types of aquatic imagery, that evoke the on-going life and propagation of his presence and his dharma. The outer rings and square frame represent the world of samsdra, sometimes indicated by the large curving svastika and often by celestial and earthly beings, auspicious symbols, pillars, and symbols of the arhat. Pictorial Aydgapa.tas We have noted already that the pictorial dydgapa.tas bear a formal resemblance topddukd slabs, which are square or rectangular plaques that depict the footprints of the Buddha in the center surrounded by auspicious symbols and vegetal ornamentation. Pictorial dydgapa.tas and pddukad slabs both have a large, centrally-placed sacred symbol or icon surrounded by matigalas, floral ornamentation, or wor- shippers. Hence, just as chatras aided in the interpretation of diagrammatic aydgapa.tas, pddukd slabs may help us discern the significance and function of pictorial dydgapa.tas. Pddukd slabs are objects of worship, and the footprints indicate the presence of the divinity or liberated being.64 This is visually confirmed by carvings that depict the Buddhist pddukd slabs sur- mounted by chatras and in the process of being worshipped by devotees (fig. 7). The footprints are symbols (pratika) used to denote the "tracks" by which the devotee is able to recognize and follow after the Buddha or other liberated being.65 A plaque that can be considered both apddukd slab and a Buddhist type ofpictorial dydgapa.ta is the Bhikhu Phagula Sila- (fig. 6). Likepddukad slabs, the Jaina pictorial dydgapa.tas depict representations of the manifest presence of the arhat, divinity or venera- ble monk to be worshipped as it can be recognized by devotees on earth. One form in which the manifest presence of the arhat is recognized by devotees on earth is that of the anthropomorphic icon. A fragment of a pictorial type ofJaina ayagapa.ta in the Ferenc Hopp Museum of Eastern Asiatic Arts in Budapest depicts an anthropomorphic image of a Jina seated in dhydna-mudrd as the main central object of worship (fig. 15). As we saw in connection with the seated Jina figure at the bottom of the outermost ring of the Fishtail Svastika Ayagapata of Dhanamitra (fig. 13) and on the British Museum Ayagapata (fig. 37), the Jina's worshipful presence can be venerated in the form of the anthropomorphic icon.

Two pictorial dydgapatas, the Sivayasa Ay-gapata (fig. 27) and the Vasu Silapata (fig. 26), depict a stupa as their main central element.66 Two flying Jaina monks (cdrana-munis) and composite celes- tial beings (kinnaras) are shown in the act of venerating the stzupa, while two female dancers are depicted on the vedikd surrounding the stzupa. As we saw on the top median edge in the outer ring of Fishtail Svastika Ayagapata of Dhanamitra (fig. 13) astupa, like the anthropomorphic icon, is another form under which the emanated presence of the arhat can be worshipped. Thus, this type ofJaina pictorial dydgapa.ta, which is square in format, can be understood as a full-scale representation of that particular embodiment of the presence of the arhat within the world, which in the diagrammatic types of dydgapa.tas is depicted in the outer edge, to be venerated by gods and human beings. While the diagrammatic ayagapa.tas appear to depict the domical roof of the world with the realm of liberation in the center, the pictorial dydgapa.tas are illustrative of the forms of worship within the samsdric world. It is interesting to note that the cdarana-munis, accomplished Jaina monks (here identifiable as belonging of the Ardhaphdlaka sect67) who have gained the power to fly through the air, are depicted 66 Two fragments in the Lucknow Museum, one of which depicts a cdrana-muni and a kinnara (SML J.Io5), while the other portrays only a kinnara (SML J.Io6), may have formed part of two other dydgapatas similar to the Sivayaa iyagapata and the Vasu Silapata, since they also both show part of an umbrella that probably would have surmounted the stupa. They are not, however, included in the list of dydgapatas, since they are too fragmentary to make a posi- tive determination. They could possibly be from a narrative panel instead. 67 Monks belonging specifically to the Ardhaphdlaka sect of Jainism are identifiable by the uniquely characteristic piece of cloth (colapatta) worn over the left forearm.The Ardhaphdlakas may also be called ekasdtaka nigaqnthas (Skt. nirgrantha). They are described by Buddhaghosa as eken'eva pilotikakhadndena purato paticchddanakd. (Manorathapurani III.394, 2ff.). See Dieter Schlingloff, "Jainas and Other 'Heretics' in Buddhist Art," inJainism and Prakrit in Ancient and Medieval India, N. N. Bhattacharyya, ed., (New Delhi: Manohar, 1994), 71. They appear on three dydgapatas (figs. 19, 26, and 30), several pre-second century A.D. sculptures (SML J.354/6o9, SML J.IoS, Brooklyn Museum of Art 87.188.5, and the NMDJ.555 tympanum, side B), and on at least twenty-five pedestals ofJina images from the Kusana Period. (See Joshi, "Early Jaina Icons from Mathura," footnote 15.) The Ardhaphadlaka Jaina sect arose before the official Svetambara and Digambara schism of the late first century A.D., and its adherents seem to have settled only in Mathura, as no evidence of their presence in any other region has come to light. The surviving donatory inscriptions from Mathura indicate that the Ardhaphdlaka Jainas had prominent monas- tic foundations and a broad base of lay support that rivaled those of the Buddhists at Mathura. Their appearance in many dozens of Mathura sculptures also underscores their prominence in monastic foundations at Mathura from at least the second century B.C. until the third century A.D. By the turn of the fourth century A.D. little trace of them remains, and they seem to have become subsumed within the Svet-ambara sect. The popularity of Naigamesin, who is found in Svetambara versions of the birth of Mahavira, and the coincidence of the gana, kula, and jakhd names of Ardhaphdlaka monastic subdivisions noted in inscriptions with those found in canonical Svetambara texts suggest that the Ardhaphdlakas shared more commonalities with the Svetambaras than with the Digambaras. Also, on the image of Sarasvati from Mathura (SML J.24), dated to the Year 54, an Ardhaphalaka monk appears together with a figure who is probably identifiable as a clothed Svet-ambara monk. This evidence, combined with the emphasis on Jaina nuns in the Mathura sculptures and donatory inscriptions of the Ardhaphdlakas, suggests that this sect was doctrinally closer to the Svetimbaras during the Kusana period; therefore it is most plausible that they would have become assimilated with the Svet-ambara sect rather than the Digambara. Before the Kusana Period, however, when- 105</page><page sequence="28">above the Rinnaras, thus suggesting that they surpass celestials in the hierarchy of beings. The supe- rior status of the monks is in keeping with the fundamental Jaina notion of the parcaparamesthins, wherein monks and acaryas are viewed as beings superior to gods and other celestial beings.68 Inci- dentally, Ardhaphdalaka monks are depicted in the elevated position of the central circle of the Parsvanatha Aydgapata, flanking the iconic representation of theJina Pdrivanatha (fig. 18). Their spe- cial status derives in large part from their ability to mediate between the earthly world and the realm of the Jina. A yaksa and yakst, known as the attendant dasanadevatds of a Jina, serve as messengers or protec- tor divinities associated with each Jina, and they can also mediate between the arhat and the inhab- itants of the earthly world. The bejeweled male and female figures flanking the central Jina of the Chaubiap-da Ayagapata (fig. 23) may be identified as his sasanadevatds. At the lower corners of the Vasu Silapata (fig. 26) are two ogival niches, each with its own vedikad, placed in the outer wall of the raised terrace flanking the stairway leading to the stupa. A male figure, identifiable as the yaksa Naigamesin by his goat head and the infant grasped in his left hand, 69 stands in the niche at the left. In the other niche stands an image of a yak.si who may be identified as a Sdasanadevatd of Mahavira, since Mahavlra is invoked in the accompanying inscription (Appendix, no. iii).70 Both the yaksa everJaina monks are depicted in Mathura sculpture they are all Ardhaphdlkas. Even throughout the Kusana period, until the third century A.D., sculptural and epigraphical remains show that the Ardhaphdlakas seem to have been the strongest sect ofJainism in Mathura. Only a few representations of either completely nude (Digambara, e.g. SML J.Io8) or clothed (?vetdmbara, e.g. SML J.24) Jaina monks appear in Kusana sculptures from Mathura, in contrast to the plethora of Ardhaphdlaka representations. Regarding the tenets of the Ardhaphdlaka sect, almost nothing is known. The various Medieval versions of the Bhadrabahucarita mention a splinter sect of monks who donned a piece of cloth during a famine in order to cover their frontal nudity so that they would be more successful in receiving alms from the laity. (See P. S. Jaini, "Jaina Monks from Mathura: Literary Evidence for their Identification on Kusa-na Sculptures," Bulletin of the School of Ori- ental and African Studies LVIII, part 3 [11995, 479 ff.). We may infer that the Ardhaphalakas also used the colapatta to cover their nudity, as is demonstrated in the second and third century A.D. representations ofArdhaphdaka monks (fig. 3o). This apparent concern with lay reception, indicated by their use of the colapatta, may have been carried over into other aspects of Ardhaphdlaka practice as well, such as the popularization of the anthropomorphic representa- tions of the Jinas in the art of their monastic foundations. Their use of the colapatta to cover their nudity during the Kusa-na Period may also reflect a stage in their gradual integration within the fully clothed Svetdmbara community of monks. 68 For a discussion of the padcaparamesthis, or "five supreme beings," (arhat, siddha, dCrya, updhlhyda, and sddhu), see Shah, jaina-Rupa-Man.dana, 41-45. 69 For the identification and function of Naigamesin see U. P. Shah, "Harinegamesin,""Journal of the Indian Society of Oriental Art xix, (1952-53), 24 ff. Naigamesin, a yaksa who presides over childbirth, is associated with Mahavira, for, particularly in the ?vetdmbara sources, he was responsible for transferring the embryo of Maha-vira from the womb of the Brahmin Devanandd to that of the Ksatriya queen Tri-ald. The story of the transfer of the embryo is found in the Acdranga Sitra, 2.3, sitra 176 (SacredBooks of the East, XXII, 19o0 ff.) and in the Kalpasitra (SacredBooks of the East, XXII, 222-29). 70 Although U. P. Shah asserts that no yaksa and yaksipair are to be found flanking a tirthankara prior to about the fifth century A.D. (jaina-Rapa-Mandana, 21z), the evidence of the Chaubiapadd Ayagapata and the Vasu Silapata suggest that the yaksa-yaksi association with a specific Jina began as early as the first century A.D. This early association is reasonable, considering the popularity of yaksa and yak.si worship at these early dates and the tendency to incorpo- rate such folk divinities into the Jaina pantheon. io6</page><page sequence="29">Naigamesin and the yaksi are identifiable as divinities, since each of their right hands is raised in abhaya-mudrd, indicating freedom from fear, and since they stand in a sacred space demarcated by a vedikd. Another pictorial dydgapa.ta, the Amohini Ayavati (fig. I7), depicts a large female figure stand- ing frontally and hieratically under a candrasdld arch, her right hand held up in abhaya-mudrd, with her left arm held akimbo. Her posture evokes that of the yaksi or sdsanadevatd in the lower right niche of the Vasu Sil-apata (fig. 26). In size the central figure of the Amohini Iyavati is larger than any of the surrounding figures, who stand in more natural poses of veneration. One flanking female figure holds a chatra while the other holds a cauri ("fly-whisk"), which are emblems of divinity; another offers a garland, and a diminutive figure, perhaps representative of a child, holds her hands in a~jal7- mudrd. These aspects suggest that the central figure is a yakst, or other female divinity, that has been incorporated into the Jaina pantheon, since she stands in the same manner as other yaksis of the early centuries B.C. and A.D. Since the inscription on the Amohini Ayavati opens with an invocation to the arhat Mahavira (see Appendix, no. xv), perhaps she can be identified as the sasanadevatd of Mahavira, and possibly the same divinity as the one portrayed in the lower right niche of the Vasu Sil-apata (fig. 26), which also invokes Mahavira in its inscription. Thus, this pictorial dydgapa.ta depicts the wor- ship of a Jaina divinity, rather than the arhat himself. 7 One pictorial dydgapa.ta, the Kana Plaque, dating to the early third century A.D., depicts two figures as the main objects of veneration (fig. 30): an Ardhaphdlaka monk and a female divinity, who are being worshipped by four small figures, one of which is a ndga. The large female figure stands with her right hand in abhaya-mudrd and her left arm akimbo, like the yaksls on the Amohini Ayavati and the Vasu Sil-apata (figs. 17 and 26, lower right). To her left, the monk, identified as "KanaSramana" in the inscription (Appendix, no. xxviii), carries a short whisk broom (rajoharana) in his raised right hand, and he probably clasps a small mukhapa.t.tikad in his left hand.72 Over his left forearm is draped a short, rectangular cloth which he uses to conceal his genitalia. This cloth identifies him as a monk of the Ardhaphdlaka (also ekasd.taka nigan.tha) sect ofJainism,73 like the monks flanking the image of Par"van-atha in the center of the P-arvan-atha Aydgapata (fig. 19) and the cdrana-munis venerating the stupa on the Vasu Silapata (fig. 26). We have noted that these monks attained reverential status as 71 Some scholars have suggested that the central female figure on the Amohini Ayavati represents Trisala, the mother of Mahavira (Shah, Studies injaina Art, 79). This interpretation is improbable, since we have no other example of a queen who is depicted alone in the manner of a divinity from this time period. It is not until much later, in medieval Jaina manuscripts, that Queen Trisala is depicted in art, and then usually in the narrative context of the birth of Mahavira. Similarly, the mother of the Buddha Sakyamuni, Queen Ma-ya, is only portrayed in narrative contexts, and she is not depicted as a divinity to be worshipped in her own right. It thus seems more plausible that the figure on the Amohini Ayavati is a yaksT, since yakss were frequently depicted and worshipped as divinities, particularly at this early date (A.D. 15). Later texts and temple inscriptions provide several names for the yaksi or sasanadevatd who is specifically associated with Maha-vira; these names include Aparajita-, Siddhayini, and Siddhayika (see Shah,Jaina- Rupa-Mandana, 217). 72 Jaina monks use the rajoharana to sweep away small insects and dust particles from the pathway before them as they walk, and they hold the mukhapat.tikd over their mouths while speaking in order to prevent insects or other living beings from inadvertently entering their mouths. 73 See above, footnote 67. Io7</page><page sequence="30">mediators between the Jina and devotees of the world, as did the sdsanadevatd yaksis, one of whom probably is represented by the female figure in abhaya-mudrd on the Kana Plaque. The narrow register at the top of the plaque contains a stzpa in the center flanked by four Jinas, two on each side. This arrangement of the four Jinas seated on both sides of a stzipa is similar to the description ofasamavasarana in the Rdyapaseniyasitra, (sftra 36), wherein astipa is described as being in the center of an assembly hall, and fourJinas sit inparyaOkdsana around the Stifpa.74 We may infer from the placement of the Jinas at the top of the plaque that they are seated in the immortal realm of the liberated, while the female divinity and the monk exist in the earthly world, to be venerated by lay worshippers and chthonic deities, such as ndgas. They are objects of veneration in part because of their special connection and association with the Jinas, as evinced by the presence of other yaksis and Iramanas in the central circles of diagrammatic dydgapa.tas who accompany the Jinas themselves (figs. 19 and 23). The Simitra Ayagapata (fig. 2) represents another variety of the Jaina pictorial type ofdydgapa.ta. Its main central element has previously been identified as a bhadrdsana, or stylized throne, which is one of the astamangalas, and, as we saw in the outer ring of the Chaubiapada Ay-agapata (fig. 23), it is a symbol that can be an object of worship when indicative of the presence of the arhat. More specifically and accurately, however, the symbol on the Simitra Aya-gapata may be identified as a sthd- pana. The formation of the object on the Simitra Ayagapata, with the parallel horizontal rectilinear bars connected by two diagonal bars, recalls textual descriptions of sthdpanas, or crossed sticks that symbolically represent the presence of the acarya.75 A monk sets up the sthdpana before him while preaching or meditating, to serve on the one hand as a corrective witness to his discourse and on the other as a display of reverence to his acarya.76 Textual sources describe the sthdpana as consisting of two or more crossed sticks that are easily collapsible and portable. The sticks themselves could have complex ornamental carvings, like the bars of the object on the Simitra Ay-agapata. A beam would be placed under the sthdpana along with lotus flowers (vard.taka), both of which are present in the Simitr- Ayagapata.77 If the main central object of the Smitra Ayagapata does depict a sthdpana, it would depict a symbolic image of a high-ranking dramana, an object of veneration, like the anthro- pomorphic representation of the Sramana portrayed on the Kana Plaque of around the third century 74 See R. C. Sharma, "Art Data in the Rayapaseniya," Bulletin of Museums and Archaeology in U.P. IX (1972), 41. 75 The sthdpana also appears with simpler carvings on the Aya-gapata Fragment with Knotted Rhizome, Sthapana, and Nandyavarta (SMLJ.I28, fig. 4). 76 "Literally [sthdpana or sthdpandcdrya] means installation of the (figure or symbol) of the dcarya, when he is not per- sonally present." Shah, Studies injaina Art, 113. In form and meaning the sthapana is probably related to the bhadrdsana, for it seems to be an abstract represen- tation of an empty seat or throne, indicating the reverential presence of a venerated figure who is physically absent. The empty seat sometimes indicates the presence of the Buddha in bas reliefs from various early Indian sites. (See, for example the worshippers adoring the invisible presence of the Buddha indicated by the empty seat from a cross- bar medallion from Amaravati in Douglas Barrett, Sculptures from Amaravati in the British Museum [London: Hunt, Barnard, and Co., 1954], pl. xxxiv.) 77 For a discussion of the sthdpana, see Shah, Studies in jaina Art, 113-14; he quotes from the sixth century A.D. Viesdvasdyaka-mahdbhhdsya ofJinabhadra Ksama-ramana, the Guruvandana-bhdsya section of the Samghdcdra-tikad of Devendrasuri, and the Pindaniryukti with commentary (Devachand Lalbhai Pustakodhara Fund. No. 44, 1918, 3-7). lo8</page><page sequence="31">A.D. (fig. 30). Depicting the sthdpana as a symbolic representation of a framana would be analogous to depicting a stapa or other non-figurative depiction of the Jina's presence on a pictorial dydgapata. Hence, the Simitra Ayagapata seems to be a portrayal in stone of the wooden prototype of a sthdpana. Such a representation in a permanent material would be useful in the context of a vihdra where teach- ings or meditation would have taken place regularly. In sum, the two types ofdydgapatas, the diagrammatic and the pictorial, appear to represent two modes of devotional art that were particularly popular before the large-scale, three-dimensional anthropomorphic representations ofJinas became mainstream. The diagrammatic types in the Jaina tradition may best be interpreted as cosmological diagrams, each with unique variations, depicting the dome of the sky with the arhat seated in the central circle surrounded by symbols of his emana- tion into the world and the worship of those symbols. The Jaina pictorial dydgapatas, on the other hand, are less esoteric, for they depict forms of worship found in the world. They include symbols or icons that indicate the worshipful presence of a liberated being, divinities, or high-ranking monks who are specially associated with Jinas as mediators between the mundane and immortal worlds. Function of Aydgapatas As for the function of the dygapa.tas, they probably should be considered objects of worship, as their name and imagery imply, that apparently were set up in a sacred precinct within a monastic or tem- ple setting. We may derive a clue as to the original function of the Jaina aydgapa.tas from the proba- ble appearance of a sthdpana as the central object of the Simitra Ayagapata (fig. 2). The Simitra Aya-gapata could be understood to have served the same function as a wooden sthdpana, i.e. as a sym- bol of the presence of the acarya which functions as a check on the behavior during meditation and teachings of the monks and, predominantly, as a token of veneration. Likewise, the other types of dyagapa.tas may have served similar functions, those aydgapatas indicating the sacred presence of a Jina being of a higher level than those indicating the presence of the sasanadevatds or high-ranking sramanas. The presence of the Jina on the dyagapatas would oversee the propagation of the dharma by monks while they preach, thus explaining the emphasis on symbols of teaching and dharma, such as the emanating nandydvartas and the cakras found on so many of the dydgapatas. Aydgapa.tas also would have been venerated by all devotees, monks and laymen, as is suggested by the relief carving in the tympanum spandrel that shows laymen bringing offerings to the sti;pa and the dydgapa.tas (fig. I). Aydgapatas also may have been related to the Jaina painted cloth prayerpa.tas, examples of which only survive from the Medieval period, such as the Varddhamana-Vidya-Pata discussed at length by U. P. Shah.78 Thesepa.tas include an invocational mantra or a prayer preceding the donatory colophon, written in a panel beneath the painted image of the arhat who is flanked by his adsanadevatds and sur- rounded by worshippers. Similarly, the inscriptions on the ayagapa.tas begin with an invocation that may be viewed as being a kind of mantra: "Adoration to the arhats" (namo arahatdndm) or "Adoration to the arhat Vardhamana" or "Adoration to the arhat Mahavira" (nama arahato vardhamdnasa or namo arahato mahdverasa). They also typically end with the phrase "for [the sake of] honoring the arhats" 78 See Shah, "Varddhamana-Vidya-Pata," pl. III, and for the prayer and dedicatory colophon see pages 44-45. Tibetan Buddhist thangkas may also share in this tradition. iog</page><page sequence="32">(arahata pujdye). The consistent presence of these mantras on dydgapa.tas suggests that they may have been used in association with prayer or meditation. Such invocations are not as consistently present in the dedicatory inscriptions on toranas, vedikads, or other solely architectural elements. This inter- pretation concurs with the function of the sthdpana, which, like the cloth prayer pa.tas, was used by monks during meditation. Another similarity between the later Jaina mantra-patas and the Jaina dyagapatas is that they both can be divided into two basic types, diagrammatic and pictorial. The diagrammatic types of the cloth mantra-patas had tantric diagrams that practitioners (sddhus) were instructed to worship with offerings.79 The other type ofmantra-pata is called a citrapa.ta, or "image plaque"; citrapatas were non- tantric and were worshipped in Jaina temples, and they could represent a variety of subjects.80 The examples of these two classes of medieval clothpatas may furnish a further clue regarding the use of the early stone dydgapatas. The diagrammatic type ofdydgapatas also may have been used by monks or lay practitioners as an aid in meditation. The Tattvdrtha-sutra, one of the few early Jaina texts that detail the meditation practices (dhydna) of the Jainas, describes the various types of meditation that a practitioner performs. One type of dhydna involves meditation upon "the structure of the universe and the interplay of causes that bring souls to their particular destinies (samsthdnavicaya).'))8 Since our analysis of the imagery on diagrammatic dydgapa.tas led us to conclude that they appear to depict a two-dimensional cosmological diagram of the domical roof of the world while often revealing the position of the liberated arhat outside the boundaries of samsdra, perhaps the diagrammatic ayd- gapa.tas served as aids to the Jaina practitioner in meditation on the structure of the universe and samsdra. Samsara and the notion of the cycles of birth and rebirth in the world are visually represented on some diagrammatic dydgapa.tas by means of the large, curving svastika (figs. II, 13, and 24). The practitioner may himself have the opportunity to become liberated or "qualified," i.e. to become an arhat, by following the doctrines (dharma) that emanate from the Jina into the world - as is visually represented on diagrammatic dyagapa.tas by the quadruple nandydvartas - and by honoring the sacred symbols, divinities, monks and acaryas within the world through prayer andpu-ja. The pictorial aya- gapa.tas, like the later citrapa.tas, were perhaps more accessible to lay followers, but still they func- tioned as objects of worship, like buddhapddas, the veneration of which would be meritorious for the devotee. PART III Brief Chronology of the Aydgapa.tas As we noted above, the extant dydgapa.tas range in date from around the mid-second century B.C. to the early third century A.D. Among the twenty-eight known aydgapa.tas a variety of sculptural styles are represented that are consonant with those of other sculptures, i.e. there is no unique "dydgapadta 79 Ibid., 47. U.P. Shah also references the "Vardhamana-Vidya-Kalpa" ofVacaka Candrasena on this point, 24. 80 Ibid., 47. 81 Tattvartha-sutra, ix.36. See Jaini,jaina Path ofPurification, 253. IIO</page><page sequence="33">style." Very few dated objects survive prior to the second century A.D., but fortunately two ayagapa.tas from this early period do contain dates in their inscriptions, namely the Year Twenty-One Aya-gapata (Appendix no. vii) and the Amohini Ayavati (Appendix no. xv), which is dated to the Year 72 (figs. 11 and 17 respectively). Although neither of these year dates is explicitly associated with an era, a pre- ponderance of evidence suggests that they both should be reckoned to the Vikrama or Azes Era of 57 B.C.82 In that case the Year Twenty-One Aya-gapata can be dated to 36 B.C. and the Amohini Ayavati to A.D. 15. As we shall see in the brief chronological survey outlined below, these two benchmarks aid in establishing a relative chronology of the dydgapa.tas. Most of the surviving ayagapatas are datable to the first century B.C. and the first century A.D., a period during which the evolution of hitherto lit- tle-studied sculptural styles can be further refined because of the evidence supplied by the dydgapa.tas.83 The Second Century B.C. Three dydgapata fragments can be attributed to the second century B.C. on the basis of their stylistic characteristics that concur with those of other reliefs datable to this time. The finely-wrought Simitra Aya-gapata (fig. 2) appears to represent the earliest surviving example of an ayagapa.ta. Its sharply delineated detailing and hardness of flattened forms offset against areas of plain ground space are matched only by carvings dating to around the mid-second century B.c., such as those on the Bud- dhist railings from Bharhut, dated by inscriptions to the time of the Shungas, or other sculptures from Mathura, including the male cauri-bearer (GMM I.I5) and the yaksF from Mehrauli in the National Museum (NMD 59.539).84 The Okarana Ayagapata85 (fig. 3) and the Ayagapata Fragment with Running Animals (SML J.618, fig. 5) represent a slightly later phase, perhaps dating to around the end of the second century 82 It is generally accepted that the Vikrama Era postulated in later inscriptions and colophons is equivalent with the Azes Era found in numerous early inscriptions. See inter alia Joe Cribb, "Western Satraps and Satavahanas: Old and New Ideas of Chronology," Ex Moneta: Essays on Numismatics, History and Archaeology in Honour of Dr. David W. MacDowall, Amal Kumar Jha and Sanjay Garg, ed. (Nashik: Bapu, 1995), 153; and Richard Salomon, "The 'Avaca Inscription and the Origin of the Vikrama Era,"Journal of the American Oriental Society CII (1982), 66-68. Since this era, beginning in 57 or 58 B.C., is most probably identified with the beginning of the reign ofAzes in the early inscrip- tions, I will refer to it as the Azes Era rather than the Vikrama Era. The Amohini Ayavati, which includes the name of Mahaksatrapa Sodasa, should be dated to the Azes Era on the basis of a complex series of arguments summarized below in footnote 90. There is precedent for attributing dated inscriptions of the first century B.C. and first century A.D. to the Azes Era. In addition, as will be shown below, the sculptural style and paleography of the Year Twenty-One Ayagapata does not concur with sculptural styles preva- lent during the twenty-first year of any other known era. 83 In this article I shall not embark on lengthy arguments about dating. I plan to include the more complete arguments and evidence for the dating of the dydgapatas and other pre-second century A.D. sculptures from Mathura in a future publication. 84 For a photograph of GMM I.I5 see J. P. Vogel, Catalogue of the Archaeological Museum at Mathura (Allahabad: Super- intendant, Government Press, United Provinces, 191o), pl. XXI; and for a photograph of the Mehrauli Yaksi see Agrawala, Indian Art, pl. LIX. 85 Stella Kramrisch dated the Okarana Aydgapata to the second century A.D., but she did not offer any reason for this late dating. The carving of the Okarana Aydgapata is not consonant with the styles of the Kusdna period. Stella Kram- risch, Patna Museum Catalogue of Antiquities (Patna: Patna Museum, 1965), 21. III</page><page sequence="34">B.C.86 The flat, shallow forms are less finely detailed than those on the Simitr-a Ayagapata, but the figures are composed of stiffly moving, abstracted shapes articulated by simple, unmodulated, incised lines. These features combine to suggest a date of no later than circa IOO B.C. The First Century B.C. The first century B.C. witnessed a greater spectrum of styles on the dydgapatas, since as many as nine ayagapa.tas appear to be attributable to various time periods throughout this century. The "Fragment of-tusika Ayagapata" (SMLJ.260, fig. 8) and the Bhikhu Phagula Sila (fig. 6) are examples of plaques datable to the early first century B.C. Although a relatively high proportion of empty background space remains, and the forms are simplified and geometric with only incised-line detailing, the carv- ings are softer and less rigid than those on the Okarana Ayagapata (fig. 3). Other plaques that probably were made in the early to mid-first century B.C. are the Shimla Museum Ayagapata (SMHP J.247, fig. 9) and the Ayagapata Fragment with Cakra (GMM 15.569, fig. Io). Although they are both quite fragmentary and worn, particularly the latter, they evince some early traits of simplicity in shapes and linear detail, which are tempered by more rounded modeling and by the infusion of a new softness and vitality unseen in the earlier examples of the second cen- tury B.C., such as the Okarana Ayagapata (fig. 3). By the mid-first century B.c. a discernible movement away from linearity and abstraction and towards a greater softening and sense of naturalism occurs. This trend is exemplified in the carvings of the Year Twenty-One Ayagapata, which as noted above is dated to 36 B.c. (fig. II). In contrast to the earlier fragments of the second and early first century B.c., the bas relief carvings on the Year Twenty-One Ayagapata exhibit an organic vigor in their gently swelling forms, which are crowded together leaving little exposed plain ground space. The articulation of the contours is slightly tenu- ous and irregular, thus imparting a soft and fresh impression. These characteristics are unlike those of the Kusaga period, to which time this plaque has previously been dated.87 Ornament datable to the early Kusana period is confident, standardized and refined (fig. 33), with each element demar- cated by thin, brittle lines" and, by the late second century A.D., ornament becomes even more schematized. Hence, it is improbable that the Year 2I date of this plaque should be reckoned to the Saka Era or any other Kusana era. Instead, the Azes Era of 57 B.C., which was in use during the first centuries B.C. and A.D. especially by rulers in the Gandhara region,89 is more appropriate. The ebul- 86 The Ayagapata Fragment with Knotted Rhizome, Sthapana, and Nandyavarta (SML B.I28, fig. 4) also may be con- temporaneous with the Okarana Aya-gapata (fig. 3) and the Ayagapata Fragment with Running Animals (fig. 5), since it evinces the shared traits of revealing empty ground planes, simplified incised line detailing, and a similarity in shape and spirit of the nandydvarta with those on the Okarana Ayagapata. However, this fragment is so small that it is difficult to ascertain a definitive judgment as to its dating. 87 N. P. Chakravarti, Archaeological Survey oflndia, Annual Report (1935-36), 113; V. S. Agrawala, Catalogue ofthe Mathura Museum, Part III, Jaina Tirthankaras and Other Miscellaneous figs., p. 37; and Joshi, "Early Jaina Icons from Mathura," 333. 88 See, for example, the carvings on the chatra of the famous Buddha (inscribed "Bodhisatva") image dedicated by the monk Bala in the Archaeological Museum, Sarnath (fig. 33), and the floral carvings on the Buddha images dated to the Year 23 from Sonkh and the Year 32 from Ahichhatra during the Kusa-na period. See Sharma, Buddhist Art, Mathura School, figs. 80 and 88, respectively. 112</page><page sequence="35">lient ornamental style of the Year Twenty-One Ay-agapata is more in keeping with pre-Kusana carv- ings such as those from the gateways of Sanchi Stapa I. Therefore, I submit that the Year Twenty- One Aya-gapata represents an important, rare dated relief from Mathura prior to the first century A.D. A more eroded dydgapata, the Ay-gapata Fragment with A'oka Flowers (SMLJ.257, fig. 12), may also be dated to the mid-first century B.c., around the time of the Year Twenty-One Ayagapata, since it exhibits many of the same traits. The adoka blossoms that originally occupied the central area of this plaque display the same soft pliability in the grooved petals and undulating forms as is seen on the Year Twenty-One Ayagapata (fig. ii). The traits of organic vitality, horror vacui, tentativeness of line and irregular forms, along with some elements of conservatism, such as the retention of a sim- ple curving svastika in the lower border, combine to suggest that the Aydgapata Fragment with A'oka Flowers should date to the mid-first century B.C. Perhaps the most spectacular examples of dydgapatas that have been discovered as yet represent the height of the late first century B.C. style at Mathura. The style that seems slightly tenuous in the Year Twenty-One Ayagapata comes into full maturity with confidence and sophistication in the carvings of the Fishtail Svastika Ayagapata of Dhanamitra (fig. 13) and the Cakra Ayagapata of Mdtharaka (fig. I4). The relief carvings on these plaques perpetuate the trends of horror vacui, vital- ity, and softness that characterize art of the mid-first century B.c., while adding a keen interest in textures and heightened complexity. A sense of surging movement, which has been intensified since the carving of the Year Twenty-One Aya-gapata (fig. II), is noticeable in the rendition of these two plaques. The dydgapa.tas of this period are characterized by rich vitality, but also by a soft quality, as though the forms have been carved from a substance softer than stone. There is also an evident inter- est in detail and whimsical shapes and forms, such as the various incised outlines of hearts, teardrops, and other shapes carved on the serpentine legs and bodies of the composite creatures in the borders and spandrels. A distinctive figural style becomes apparent in these two dydgapa.tas (figs. 13-14). Although they are all well-modeled with soft, fleshy forms, the female figures are distinguished by their segmented torsos; each of their waists is articulated as a short cylindrical segment from which her breasts and hips flare, and often a horizontal incised line demarcates these three elements. At this period the male figures are distinguished by their corpulency; their full, soft bellies hang over their belts. These dis- tinctive figural styles will be carried on into the first century A.D. The Ferenc Hopp Museum Ayagapata (fig. 15) also appears to date to around the end of the first century B.C. The figural style of the central Jina, with his broad face and torso, short neck, double- outlined almond-shaped eyes, slight smile, and corpulent belly concur with the male facial and figural types of this period. The softness and richness notable in the carving of the ornament and ma igalas in the borders of the Ferenc Hopp Museum Ayagapata betray its proximity in date to the Fishtail Svastika Ayagapata of Dhanamitra and the Cakra Ayigapata of Matharaka (figs. I3-I4). The quality 89 See, for example, the Indravarman Casket inscription of the Year 63 of Azes. (Richard Salomon and Gregory Schopen, "The Indravarman (Avaca) Casket Inscription Reconsidered: Further Evidence for Canonical Passages in Buddhist Inscriptions,"Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies VII, no. I [1984], Io8.) Another is the Kalawan (near Taxila) Copper Plate Inscription of the Year 134 of Azes. See Sten Konow, "Kalawdn Copper-plate Inscription of the Year 134,"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, (October 1932), 62. 113</page><page sequence="36">of the pattern texturing the garland which hangs from the chatra compares favorably with the twisted garland pattern surrounding the third concentric ring of the Fishtail Svastika Ayagapata of Dhana- mitra (fig.I3). The vitality of the curving foliate arms of the ornament in the upper border and the thick, dotted srivatsa also resonate with the ornament found on the Year Twenty-One Aya-gapata (fig. II), the Fishtail Svastika Ayagapata of Dhanamitra and the Cakra Ayagapata of Matharaka. Thus, while the Jina figure seated in the central circle of the Fishtail Svastika Aya-gapata of Dhanamitra (fig. 13) is depicted in small scale, the Jina on the Ferenc Hopp Museum Ayagapata is a unique early bas relief depiction of a larger-scale iconic Jina figure (fig. 15) probably dating to the end of the first century B.C. The First Century A.D. The second dated dydgapata, the Amohini Ayavati (fig. I7), contains the year date of seventy-two in its inscription along with the name of the Svami Mahaksatrapa Sodasa. Like the Year Twenty-One Aya-gapata, the Amohini Ayavati's date also should be reckoned to the Azes Era, thereby producing a date of A.D. 15.90 If this is correct, then the Amohini Ayavati provides essential evidence for deter- mining that the reign of Mahaksatrapa Sodasa should date to around A.D. y15. By extension, other 90 The date of Mahaksatrapa Sod-sa crucially hinges on the dating of the Amohini Ayavati, for only the Amohini Ayavati inscription contains both a reference to Sodasa as well as a year date, though the era is unspecified. In the Amohini Ayavati inscription, Sodtsa bears the title "Svami Mahaksatrapa," whereas in the Kharosthi inscription from Mathura on the lion capital in the British Museum, Sodasa is a "Ksatrapa," while his father, Rajuvula, is called a "Maha-ksatrapa." (See Sten Konow, in Kharoshthi Inscriptions, Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum II, pt. I [1929] 30 ff.). Hence, the Amohini Ayavati should postdate the Mathura lion capital inscription. This Mathura lion capital inscription can be dated between 2 B.C. and A.D. 6 for the following reasons. This inscription also refers to Mahaksatrapa Kusuluasa Patika. In the Taxila Copper Plate Inscription dated to the Year 78 of the Maharaja Moga (Maues), Kusuluasa Patika is an "heir apparent" (yauva) to his father, the Ksatrapa of Chukhsa, Kusuluka Liaka. (See Konow, Kharoshthi Inscriptions, 23-29.) Since most scholars agree that Maharaja Moga's reign began in circa 80 B.C., then Patika was still an heir apparent in circa 2 B.c. Hence the Mathura lion cap- ital inscription, wherein Patika has become a "Mahaksatrapa," must postdate the Taxila Copper Plate inscription, i.e. circa 2 B.C. The British Museum's lion capital inscription must be earlier than A.D. 6, because its inscription also contains the name of the "heir apparent" (yuvardaja) Kharaosta, who by A.D. 6 had become a yaguraja, or "clan king," accord- ing to a series of inscriptions on a silver goblet reliquary and a stone reliquary, the latter of which is dated to the Year 63 of the Azes Era, equivalent to A.D. 6. (For this last chronological sequence on the reliquaries, see Richard Salomon, "Silver Goblet Reliquary Inscriptions of Kharaosta and Indravarma,"Journal of the American Oriental Society CXVI [1996], 418 ff; and Richard Salomon and Gregory Schopen, op. cit., 107 ff.) The Year 72 on the Amohini Ayavati, when reckoned to the Azes Era of 57 B.c., renders the date of A.D. I5. The date of A.D. I5 both postdates A.D. 6, the terminuspost quem non for the lion capital inscription, yet still falls reasonably within the lifetime of Sod-sa, who was a Ksatrapa during the time of the carving of the lion capital inscription. Other known eras render a date that is either earlier than 2 B.C. or too late to reasonably fall within the lifetime of Sodasa. With regard to the controversy surrounding the reading of the year date in the Amohini Ayavati inscription as either 72 or 42, the former is the most plausible. The Year 42 of the Azes Era would yield a date of I B.c. for Mahdksa- trapa Sod.sa, which is prior to the circa 2 B.C. terminus ante quem non for the Mathura lion capital inscription. Fur- thermore, Liiders gives a lengthy and convincing argument to support the reading of 72 rather than 42, based on comparisons with other inscriptions and manuscripts in which the digits appear, and the reading of the digit on the Amohini plaque itself is clear. See Heinrich Liiders, "Das Zeichen fiir 70 in den Inschriften von Mathura aus der 114</page><page sequence="37">objects dated to the reign of Sodasa which do not contain year dates can thereby be attributed to the early first century A.D. as well. Although the figural carvings are quite worn, the segmented style of female torso is discernible. The texturing of the gently swinging, rounded garlands continues from the type of texturing seen on the dydgapa.tas dating to the late first century B.C., and the foliate ornament in the voluted capi- tal at the left closely recalls both in form and style the ornament in a corner square of the Cakra Ay-agapata of Matharaka (fig. 14) and in the top border of the Ferenc Hopp Museum Aya-gapata (fig. Iy). Further complexity in postures and spatial relations distinguishes the Amohini Ayavati from the late first century B.C. group of dydgapatas; for example there is some foreshortening seen in the tilt of the chatra above the head of the central female divinity, in contrast to the chatra over the head of the Jina on the Ferenc Hopp Museum Aya-gapata. The dated Amohini Ayavati is particularly valu- able in the attribution of other figural sculpture to the period of Sodasa. The P-arvana-tha Ayagapata (fig. 18) and the Namdighosa Ayagapata (fig. 20) are also datable to the early first century A.D., i.e. during the time of Maha-katrapa Sodasa. The shallow relief on these diagrammatic ayagapa.tas evinces a new and unique style of ornamental carving that emphasizes del- icacy and naturalistic lyricism, which is consonant with the style of relief carving seen on two sepa- rate doorjambs dated by inscription to the time of Sod-sa, namely the Vasu Doorjamb (fig. 35) and the Mora Doorjamb (figs. 29 and 36).9' Overall they have a more calm, unified and lace-like appear- ance in contrast to the rich surging quality of the plaques from the late first century B.C. (figs. 13 and 14).92 Saka- und Kusana-Zeit," Philologica Indica (G6ittingen: Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht, I940). (I would like to thank Dr. Brian Domitrovic of Harvard University for his assistance in translating this article.) It is important to note that the terse summary of the complex series of arguments given here for the date of circa A.D. I5 for the Amohini Ayavati and Mahaksatrapa Sodasa is the most cogent, in my view, given the confluence of surviving evidence, but it is not infallible. The realm of early Indian epigraphy is fraught with uncertainties; for example, we cannot be completely sure about the rigidity of the ranking system used among the Indo-Scythian satraps and the Apraca kings, and the beginning of the reigns of the Saka kings Maues and Azes cannot be pinpointed with precise certainty. However, in order to progress our understanding of the history of the first centuries B.C. and A.D., we must utilize the available evidence to the best of our abilities in order to propose a history that is at least reason- able and free of internal contradiction. 91 The doorjamb dedicated by Vasu (GMM 13-367, fig. 35) and the doorjamb from Mora (SML J.526, figs. 29 and 36) both exhibit the similar distinctive lightness, delicacy and sophisticated elegance of shallow vegetal carving as is seen on the Parivandtha and Namdighosa Aiyagapatas (figs. 18 and zo20). The Vasu Doorjamb is dated by inscription to the reign of Mahaksatrapa Sodasa, while the Mora Doorjamb, which is carved in the same style, was discovered along with an inscription on a separate stele dated to the reign of Sodasa (GMM Q.I; Liiders, Mathura Inscriptions, 154). Joanna Williams argues that the relief carving on this doorjamb dates to the late third or early fourth century A.D. (Joanna Gottfried Williams, The Art of Gupta India: Empire and Province (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1982),13-14. However, since its style concurs with that ofa number of other sculptures datable to the period ofSod-asa, I hold that the inscription is contemporaneous with the doorjamb carvings. 92 The Ayagapata Fragment with Overlapping Rosette/Palmette Border (SML B.146, fig. 16) may also be datable to around the early first century A.D., but it is so worn and fragmentary that it is difficult to determine its date from an analysis of its carvings. However, the closest analogue to the remainder of its carvings can be found in the carvings on a doorjamb from Jankhat, Farukhabad District, U.P. (Kannauj Archaeological Museum 79/218), whose carvings 115</page><page sequence="38">The figure of the Jina and the two attendant Ardhaphdlaka monks in the central circle of the Parsvanatha Ayagapata represent examples of the male figural style of this period, with their corpu- lency, broad faces, short necks, double-outlined almond-shaped eyes and slight smile (fig. I9). This bold figural style had already begun to gain prominence by the end of the first century B.C., as seen in the Ferenc Hopp Museum Ayagapata (fig. I5). It became prevalent during the time of Sosasa, as seen on the Amohini Ayavati (fig. 17) and the Parivanatha Ayagapata (fig. I9), and it contrasts with the delicacy of the contemporaneous ornamental carving. The British Museum Ayagapata also appears to have been carved around the time of Sodasa at the beginning of the first century A.D. (fig. 37). Though the slight erosion of the plaque's surface has caused some of the delicacy of the detail to be muted, the gentle curling fronds and clear, elegant foli- ation seen at the base of the pot and the nandydvartas are matched only by other ornamental carvings of the time of od-asa, such as the asoka rhizome at the left of the Vasu Doorjamb (fig. 35). The bold rendering of the figures with broad chests and short necks, along with the soft, limpness of the crossed legs of the Jina on the British Museum Ayagapata also cohere with the modes of portrayal seen dur- ing the early first century A.D. Two dyagapatas, the Sihanamdika Ayagapata (fig. 21) and the Acald Ayagapata (fig. 22), hint at the beginnings of standardization and regularity in their carvings which suggest a further matura- tion of the sculptural style of the first century A.D. The ornamental carving of these two plaques is rendered in a more regular, almost mechanical mode, lacking the organic dynamism of the late first century B.C. or the delicacy of the early first century A.D. Tightness and elongation begin to modu- late the form of the seated Jina in the center of the Sihanamdika Ayagapata (fig. 2I), indicating a new trend in figural style. However, they do retain the richness of textures and softness of carving that betray their pre-second century A.D. date, as they are not as refined and crisp in style as the early sec- ond century A.D. Kusana material datable to the reign of Kaniska (fig. 33). By the late first century A.D. dygapa.ta carvings begin to closely foreshadow the sculptural styles of the Kusana period of the early second century A.D. Reduced interest in rich textures or details is notable in the carvings of the Chaubiapadd Ay-gapata (fig. 23) and the Amoghadatta Ayagapata (fig. 24) - a trait held in common with Kusana period relief sculpture. The stiff, regularized grapevine rhizome of the Ay-gapata Fragment with Grapevine Border (GMM Q.3, fig. 25) has lost the light- ness and delicacy that characterized the one surrounding the Namdighosa Aya-gapata of the time of Mah-ksatrapa Sodasa (fig. 2o). The flying figures on the Chaubiapada Ayagapata (fig. 23), Amogha- datta Ayagapata(fig. 24), the Aydgapata Fragment with Grapevine Border(fig. 25), the Vasu Sila-pata (fig. 26), and the dancing figures on the Sivayala Ayagapata (fig. 27) display a tightening and smooth- ness in their limbs which were unseen in the soft fleshy forms of the earlier plaques, but will be fur- ther developed in the more powerful and aggressive figural styles of the Kusama period. However, the figures retain some softness and corpulence, which will have disappeared by the second century A.D. The billowing upper garments articulated by broad parallel lines represent the trend towards probably slightly predate those datable to the time of Socdasa. For a photograph, see J. Williams, op. cit., fig. 8. Although Williams dates the Jankhat doorjambs to the third century A.D., a number of stylistic, epigraphic, and paleographic reasons argue in favor of a date in the late first century B.C., despite the inscription of Virasena on the inner side, who probably is not to be identified with the Naga king known from coins. II6</page><page sequence="39">simplicity and boldness in the depiction of details and textiles; gone are the more naturalistic irreg- ular pleats rendered with modulated lines of the late first century B.c.93 The Second and Third Centuries A.D. Among the surviving ayagapatas only two seem to be possibly attributable to the second century A.D., corresponding to the early and mid-Kusana period - a time that witnessed an efflorescence of sculp- tural and architectural production. If, as the current evidence suggests, dyagapatas were less popular during this century, then this waning in popularity perhaps could be explained by a turn towards an interest in three-dimensional, anthropomorphic representations of the Jina and Buddhas. In partic- ular, the four-sided sarvatobhadrikad types of sculptures, like diagrammatic ayagapatas, similarly emphasize the four-directional cosmological aspect ofJainism. However, a couple of fragments, prob- ably of dydgapa.tas, may be datable to the second century A.D., although they are quite effaced, and other ayagapa.tas attributable to the early to mid-Kusana period may be discovered in the future. The Jivanamda Aya-gapata (SML J.44, fig. 28) and the Laghaka Ayagspata (SML J.25I, fig. 34) were prob- ably both dydgapa.tas originally, and the dry quality of their carving suggests that they might date to the second century A.D. The Kana Plaque (SML J.623, fig. 30) and the Ko!iya Gana Ayagapata (fig. 31) represent the two dyagapa.tas that are probably datable to the third century A.D. The Kana Plaque is dated in its inscrip- tion to the Year 99 (Apendix no. xxviii), and given the consonance of its stylistic features with other sculptures dated to the late Kusana period, it can be attributed with some certainty to the early third century A.D. The dry, formalized stiffness, minimal interest in design elements, exaggerated linear- ity, and a turn towards abstraction especially in the facial features are pervasive in the sculpture of the late second to early third century A.D.94 So little remains of the carvings of the Ko!iya Gana Ayagapata (fig. 31), that it is difficult to make a positive determination regarding its date. However, the scratchy simplicity of the traces of patterning, the silhouette of the Jina, the stiffness of the hang- ing garlands from the chatra of the central stapa, and the paleography of the characters in the inscrip- tion all point to a late Kusana dating for this fragment. Hence, as we have seen, the corpus of known dydgapa.tas represents a spectrum of styles spanning the centuries from as early as the mid-second century B.C. to the third century A.D. In summary, the combination of epigraphic, literary, and sculptural evidence suggests that the unique plaques known as dyagapatas were objects of worship, carved with reliefs that are arranged around a central figure or symbol for veneration. Although there is some evidence to imply that Bud- dhists, Hindus, and followers ofyaksa and ndga cults may have used them, most of the surviving dyd- gapa.tas are identifiable as Jaina. Aydgapa.tas can be classified into two major types, the diagrammatic and the pictorial; the former seem to depict two-dimensional cosmological diagrams, while the lat- ter emphasize modes of worship and devotion within the world. The diagrammatic and pictorial types of dydgapa.tas may have been used by Jaina monks during meditation and teaching, the former type 93 J. E. van Lohuizen-de Leeuw identified the traits of corpulency and the billowing scarves with pre-Kusaga styles of the first century A.D. See van Lohuizen-de Leeuw, The Scythian Period, 16O-6I. 94 An example of a late-Kusdna sculpture exhibiting these characteristics is the seated image of the Jina Aristanemi (GMM B.I5), dated to the Year 57, perhaps of the Era of Kaniska II. See von Mitterwallner, op. cit., pl. 67. 117</page><page sequence="40">perhaps on a more esoteric level than the latter. Aydgapatas seem to have been made at least as early as the mid-second century B.C., and they continued to be produced into the third century A.D., but their popularity seems to have abated with the proliferation of iconic anthropomorphic images carved in the round, particularly of the four-directional (sarvatobhadrika) type. Since dydgapatas are richly carved with a variety of figural and ornamental imagery, as well as epigraphs, they are a uniquely valuable source for our understanding of the art and religious culture of Mathura, particularly of the first century B.c. and first century A.D. 118</page><page sequence="41">APPENDIX List of Aydgapatas with Inscriptions and Epigraphical Notes In order of museums and museum accession numbers as follows: THE BRITISH MUSEUM i.

In other inscriptions that mention the location where the plaque was set up, either the meaning of the locale (bhamdire) is uncertain (the Namdighosa Ayagapata inscription, below no. xi), or the inscription is so fragmentary that it is not clear whether the locale (vihdre) is the place at which the dydgapa.ta itself was set up (the Ko!iya Gana Ayagapata inscription, below no. vi). The fact that the Vasu Silapata (fig. 26) is called a fildpata in its inscription, though it is carved with almost identical imagery as the Sivayasa -yagapata (fig. 27), which is called an dydgapata in its inscription (below, no. xxii), leads us to infer that the words "Sildpata")) and "dydgapata" were some- times used interchangeably. Aydgapa.tas seem to be a more specialized subset of fildpatas, such that all dydgapa.tas are fildpatas, but not all fildpatas are necessarily dydgapa.tas. iv.

Notes: The inscription is on the back of this dydgapata fragment, and the text area measures 14 1/2 x 5 I/2 inches, enclosed within a border of overlapping rosettes that are carved in low relief. It is not oriented to the same direction as the relief carvings of the dydgapa.ta itself on the obverse. The inscrip- tion on the reverse of this dydgapata fragment is probably not contemporaneous with the dydgapa.ta carvings on the obverse. The paleography of the letters points to a dating, probably late in the sec- ond century A.D., thus suggesting that the dydgapata was reused at a later date to record the dedica- tion of a temple, shrine, or palace (prasdda) by a woman named Pusa. The dry, scratchy carving of the rosettes in the border on the reverse further supports the later dating for the inscription on the back of the plaque. Aydgapatas were frequently reused, perhaps supplanted in the temples or monasteries by three- dimensional images, for their reverse sides provided broad, flat areas of finished, uncarved stone. Other dyagapatas whose back sides were used for different purposes at later dates, include the JIvanamda Ayagapata (SML J.44, fig. 28), whose reverse was carved with an image and another inscription; the Laghaka Ayagapata (SML J.25I, fig. 34), which was recut into the form of an archi- tectural lion capital with a tenon; and the British Museum Ayagapata (19Ol, 12-24, Io.

The letters are scratchy and sans-serif, and most likely of a third or fourth century A.D. date, which also seems to correspond to what is left of the carvings. The inscrip- tion is to be read from the right and top sides of the plaque, thus it is not oriented to the same direc- tion as the stupa in the central medallion or the seated figure of the Jina. The idkhd, or "branch", most commonly found in connection with the Koliya gana and Thanikiya (Sthaniya) kula is the Vaira sdhd, so we can confidently postulate the name Vaira, or some form thereof, before the word Sa(khdto). (See Kana Plaque, SMLJ.623, below no. xxviii.) These are all names of divisions and subdivisions in the SvetambaraJaina monastic hierarchy, the Ko!iya gana apparently being the most prominent, as it appears more often inJaina inscriptions than the names of other ganas. This inscription confirms that dydgapatas were made and used by this specific Jaina sect and that this dydgapa.ta probably was set up in the vihdra of a monastic compound. vii. 35.2563 Year Twenty-One Ayagapata (fig.

Joshi'o' refer the date in the Year Twenty-One Ayagapata inscription to the Saka Era of 78 A.D., there are a number of paleographic, epigraphic, and stylistic reasons that argue in favor of the earlier Azes or Vikrama Era of 58/57 B.c. The long form of the "di" aksara in the first line, and in the second line, the rounded form of the "sa," and the bulbous ca" are all pre-Kaniska characteristics that become significantly altered by the time of the inscrip- tions dated to the reign of Kaniska and his successors. Also, N. P. Chakravarti points out that typi- cally in Kusaga inscriptions from Mathura, the date is given in seasons and fortnights, and the name of the month is also usually given.102 Although the convention of dating in fortnights is not perva- sive during the Kusaga period, this inscription follows a mode of dating found in earlier epigraphs, stating the date only with the year, month and day numbers.1o3 These paleographic and epigraphic reasons, taken in conjunction with the artistic style of the carving on the plaque, suggest that this dydgapa.ta dates prior to the Kusaga Period, and it may be reckoned to the Azes Era, like the Amo- hini Ayavati (Appendix no. xv), thereby providing us with a date of 36 B.c. for this daydgapa.ta. The unusual spelling of arhat as "ari[ha]ta," instead of the more common arahata, is mirrored by the spelling of devikula (instead of devakula) in the Vasu Sila-pata inscription (Appendix no. iii). viii. 48.3426 Chaubiapada Ayagapata (fig. 23) from Chaubiapada-Tila, Mathura circa late first century A.D. red sandstone H. 15 in. x W. 26 in.

Thus, the few early dated inscriptions from the Northwest or the Deccan may not be able to aid in the attribution of an era for this dydgapa.ta.

It occurs in a position that, in other inscriptions, corresponds to the placement of one's occupation. LUiders and Damsteegt tentatively suggest trans- lating vdnika as "musician" or "singer"'04 (cf. nataka, meaning "dancer" or "actor" on the Sivayasa Ayagapata, SML J.255, below no. xxii). Another possible translation is "merchant." Vdnika may also be a family or clan name of the donor's father, in which case the translation would read: "An dya- gapata was set up by Sihanamdika, son of Simhaka of the Vanika (gotra) and son of a Kosiki, for the sake of honoring the arhats." Ko'iki refers to the gotra of the mother, and it is often found in dyd- gapata inscriptions and on other inscriptions datable to the time of Sodasa.1o5 The long -pd syllable in dyagapd.ta is unique among the extant examples of the word. Padta, accord- ing to Monier-Williams refers to "breadth, expanse, or extension," which is a rather unsatisfactory translation for this context. Its occurrence may best be explained as an orthographical error, which is not uncommon in mixed-dialect inscriptions. The inscriber may have intended to write dyagapa.td, thus referring to the donation of several dydgapa.tas, as is seen in the Namdighosa Ayigapata (RBS J.686A, below no. xi), but of this we cannot be sure.

The "bha-" aksara seems to be followed by a -ya, not a -ra. Thus it is more likely that it was dedicated by "Okarana's wife" (bhaydye), as is common on dydgapa.tas, rather than his brother. 104 Liders' List, index, 222; Damsteegt, Epigraphical Hybrid Sanskrit, 253. 105 See the Simitra Ayagapata (Appendix no. xxiii) and the Mirjapur stele inscription of Kau iki Paksaka, wife of a Brah- min (above footnote 27), and the reference to a kauSi(ki)- on the Vasu Doorjamb inscription (Government Museum Mathura 13.367; Liders, Mathura Inscriptions, no. 115).

Notes: The meaning of bhamdira, which names the location in which the dydgapa.tas were set up, unfortunately is unclear. Damsteegt states that it refers to the name of a garden or park in Mathura.I0s Previously it was thought to be related to the Sanskrit word bhanddara, meaning "treasury" or "store- house," however the phonetic shifts from bhanddra to bhamdira are unexpected and not easily expli- cable. Liiders hesitantly suggests that it may refer to a tree or a storehouse.'o9 The word sovanika is a synonym for hairanyaka, meaning goldsmith.,1o In another inscription on the rim of a bowl surmounting a male head from Sadar Bazaar, Mathura (GMM I2.26o), there appears to be a reference to the t"vihdra of the goldsmiths" (suvanakd)."' This Sadar Bazaar inscription sug- gests that perhaps the guild of goldsmiths donated money for the construction of Buddhist vihdras, which may have contained a treasury or storehouse (bhamdira), at which Buddhist dydgapa.tas and figures with ablution bowls may have been set up. Hence, this Namdighosa Aya-gapata originally might have been from a Buddhist site, but there is no satisfactory proofofthis other than the untrust- worthy assertion of A. Fiihrer and the coincidence of other Buddhist pieces having been donated by goldsmiths.." Interestingly, the long d ending of dygapatd and its modifying participlepratithdpitd means that the word dydgapatd, is either feminine singular or masculine plural. Since we have so many other examples of the word dydgapata that are masculine, the latter is the most plausible interpretation. Hence this inscription must be understood as recording the dedication of multiple dyagapatas. STATE MUSEUM, HIMACHAL PRADESH xii.

In the year seventy-two of Svami Mahaksatrapa Soddsa, in the second month of winter, on the ninth day, [this] dyavati was set up by Amohini, a Kochi, a female lay disciple of the ascetics, wife of Pala, son of Hariti, together with her sons Palaghosa, Pothaghosa, and Dhanaghosa. The dyavati is for the sake of honoring the arhats." Notes: The year date, which has also been read by some as forty-two, has been convincingly estab- lished as seventy-two by Heinrich Liiders, and this reading of the date is the most plausible given the known chronology of the ksatrapas in Mathura and other regions during this time."3 "Ayavati" (or Sanskrit "Alryavati") may be an appellation of the female figure (perhaps a idsanadevatd) depicted in the center of the plaque, meaning "She who possesses favor or excellence." On the other hand, this appellation may also refer to the dydgapa.ta itself, under a synonym with feminine gender, for the word 113 See above, footnote go. 127</page><page sequence="50">dyavati appears where dydgapa.ta would appear in other inscriptions, i.e. immediately preceding "pratithpita" and "arahata pujdye." Hence it seems there is some correlation between the use of the word dyavati and the word dydgapa.ta. Here the word dya-vati is probably derived from the Sanskrit drya, since the a vowel of the second aksara is short, in contrast to dyaga, which seems unlikely to be a Prakrit derivation from a-rya+ ka. The family or clan (gotra) name of Amohini, here rendered as "Kochi" (Sanskrit Kauts7) is also seen in the Amoghadatta Ayagapata inscription (SMLJ.264, below no. xxvi) in its variant form of "Kotsi," and it also occurs in the Buddhist cave temple inscription at Kuda, Maharashtra, as the clan name ("Kochhi") of the mother of a local chief (mahdbhoja).I'4 "Hariti" may also refer to the gotra of the mother-in-law, if it does not refer to her name specifically. xvi. J.44 Jivanamd-a Aya-gapata (fig. 28) from Kafika-li-Tila-, Mathura circa second century A.D. (?) buff sandstone H. 6 in. x W. 9 in. (15.o x 23.o cm.) Obverse Inscription: ... (bha)[ya]ye jzvana-mddye... Translation: "... by Jivana-mda, [wife of] ... Notes: The carvings on this simple fragment are clearly legible, and since the first two extant aksaras form the ending -[yd]ye, we can extrapolate that they originally formed part of the word bharyd, mean- ing "wife". This fragment probably formed part of an dyagapa.ta, and the proportions of the one-line epigraph to the stone are similar to those of the Ayagapata Fragment with Asoka Flowers (SMLJ.257, Appendix no. xxiv, fig. I2). Reverse Inscription: I. siddham namastvarhadbhyah 2. maha-radja mahdksatrapa mahd-... 3.... Translation: "Hail! Adoration to the arhats! The Great King, the Great Satrap, the Great ... Notes: The inscription on the reverse of this fragment is carved on a pedestal of a frontally standing figure, only the lower legs and feet of which survive. It probably dates to the third or fourth century A.D., since the i superscript curves exaggeratedly over the letter, as it does in inscriptions dated to the early Gupta Period. Furthermore, the opening invocation "siddham" is indicative of a late Kusana date (cf. Kana Plaque, dated to the Year 99, SML J.623, below no. xxviii). Hence, SML J.44 repre- sents an example of an dyagapa.ta that was reused at a later date. The reusing of dydgapa.tas is fairly common, since their back sides provide a flat clear surface. (See also the British Museum Aiyagapata, the GMM Q.3 Ayagapata Fragment with Grapevine Border and the SML J.25I Laghaka Ayagapata, for example). 114 Liiders' List no. 1058. I28</page><page sequence="51">Neither Biihler nor Liiders noted the remains of the ha- aksara at the current broken end of the second line."5 Hence, they and others after them have assumed that "Mahdraja Mahdksatrapa Ma-" refers to a Satrap King named Ma-. However, the existence of the -ha immediately following the last ma- is clear, which suggests that yet another title beginning with mahd- followed mahdksatrapa or that the name of the ruler began with Maha--. The third line is unfortunately damaged. xvii. J.248 Cakra Ayagapata of Matharaka (fig. 14) probably from Kafikali-Tila, Mathura circa late first century B.C. red sandstone H. 34 in. x W. 34 in. (87.0 x 87.0 cm.) I. namo arahato mahdvitrasa mdtharaka(sa) (kd)lavddasa sd(kam) bhaydye sivarakhitdye aya[gapa.to] Translation: "Adoration to the arhat Mahavira! The dydgapa.ta of Matharaka, a kdlavdda, and his wife Sivarakhitt" Notes: Liiders' interpretation of the word "[kd]lavudda as referring to an occupation"II6 seems more plausible than the translations offered by other scholars including Bi*hler"7 and Shah,II8 who inter- pret it as the name of an inhabitant of Mathura. "Kalavada" perhaps means "wine-seller" (Sanskrit kalyavdla), however this interpretation is by no means certain. It is also found in the Simitra Aya-gapata (see below no. xxiii) and in donatory inscriptions from Sanchi St-pa I (Liiders' List nos. 330, 522-23, e.g. "Gift of Datta, the Kalavada from Vidisa), but these inscriptions offer little clue as to the meaning of the word. Liiders also suggests that the word could be a title of a high-ranking official, since "kdla" is found as such in Kharosthi documents from eastern Turkestan."9 He further cites the usage of M[d]thuri kalavad[d] in the inscription on the base of the female figure of Tosa from Mora, saying that since no proper name is associated in this case with the occupation, then it must be a title. "Ma-tharaka" is probably a proper name, rather than "an inhabitant of Mathura." Close examina- tion of the inscription on the Cakra Ayagapata reveals that the second aksara appears clearly to be "tha" not "thu,"'0 and it would be unusual to have both the long d in the first aksara as well as the - ka suffix if the word were to denote an inhabitant of Mathura. For these reasons, we shall consider "Matharaka" to be a proper masculine name, either derived from mdtha, "one who churns or deals in 115 Biihler, Epigraphia Indica, vol.

See G. Biihler, "NewJaina Inscriptions from Mathura," Epigraphia Indica, I (1892), 390, no. XVIII; and Liiders' List, no. 85. Madhara or Mathura is cited as the name of a gotra in Mehta and Chandra, op. cit., 592. Hence, Matharaka of our inscription could refer to a member of this gotra. Izq</page><page sequence="52">buttermilk," or from Mathaka, "a destroyer," or it may be similar to the patronymic name "Mathava found in the datapatha Brdhmana. It would make sense to have a masculine proper name precede the occupation, like "Pothayajaka kd.lavd.la" in the Simitra iyagapata (SMLJ.256, below no. xxiii). Liiders and Biihler postulate the word sd[hd] after [kd]lavdda, but in the other instances wherein this preposition ("with") is used, it always has a short sa- for its first ak.sara. In the Cakra Ayagapata inscription, however, the long sd- is clear; therefore, unless it is an orthographical error, perhaps it is better to postulate sd[kam], meaning "jointly" or "together with." The instrumental -ye endings of bhaydye Sivarakhitdye should then be understood to mean "with [his] wife Sivarakhita-." xviii.

Banerji was able to decipher much of it when he took it into the sunlight in 19z12, and the above transcription is fairly legible from a rubbing made by him at that time.,, The final aksara of the second line is probablypa-, which sug- gests that this inscription ended with the word patisthdpita, meaning "was set up. xix.

Notes: The va- aksara following arahato in the first line is quite clear, as are the first two aksaras of dyagapa.ta, which, along with the surviving ornament consisting of an arc of what was once a circu- lar twisted garland and the end of a fishtail, lead to the identification of this piece as almost assuredly having been an dyagapa.ta in its original state. The reverse side of the surviving fragment has been recut in the form of a seated lion on a platform with a tenon below. 121 R. D.

Notes: Much more of this inscription is legible in the rubbing published by Bilhler'" than can be read directly from the stone now. The "dhitu" in the first line is not in the instrumental case, but this also occurs in the Vasu Silapata inscription (GMM Q.2, above no. iii), where most epithets of the donor are provided with the -ye or other instrumental ending, except for dhitu, which was undeclined. The name Acala is found twice among the inscriptions at Sanchi Stupa I.Iz3 The name of the donor's father is unusual, and previously has been read as "Mala... na," but names are not known to begin with mala-. Instead, it is possible that the first two aksaras are mola or mala. Nana also exists as a man's name, so it seems plausible that the father of Acala was Malanana or Molanana. We may also consider the possibility that this name is of foreign origin, which may explain why it is so unusual. xxi.

Notes: Biihler and Liiders postulate the name "Sivaghosaka,"I-4 but the "-sa" aksara is unlikely given the remains of the letter, which seems to form the lower left corner of a triangular character, proba- bly either va or ma. This inscription has been published as being dedicated by "the wife of Sivaghosaka," but, there is space enough for six more syllables in the lacuna between the gho and the bharyd, which suggests that other information was provided, and casts doubt as to whether or not this plaque was dedicated by the wife of Sivagho-, or if this is the name of another relation, such as a father. Therefore, since the name of the donor or the donor's husband is so uncertain, it seems best to identify this plaque by the name of the Jina Parivanatha, who is depicted in the center surmounted by the serpent. 122 Epigraphia Indica, vol.

An dydgapa.ta was caused to be made by Sivayasa, wife of the actor Phaguya'a,... for the sake of honoring the arhats." Notes: What remains of the inscription is extremely clear, and there is little controversy regarding its reading. Natakasa is from the root V/nat, meaning to dance, act, or mime. Bilhler and Smith'2s prefer the translation "dancer," apparently in connection with the appearance of the dancing girls on the railing in the carving. Dancing girls are a common motif, however, so there is no reason that their appearance should inform the translation of the occupation of the donor's husband, so I here follow Monier-Williams in the translation of"((nataka" specifically as "actor," especially given the male gen- der of the donor's husband. Either actor or dancer is probably acceptable. xxiii. J.256 Simitra Ayagapata (fig. 2) from Kafika-li-Tila (?), Mathura circa mid-second century B.C. dark gray sandstone H. 18 in. x W. 29 in.

An dydgapa.ta was set up by Simitra, of the Ko iki [family], (wife of?.) the kdlavada, Pothaya'a(ka), son of Goti." Notes: "Pothaya'a(ka)" works well as a name for the husband or other male relation of the donor, espe- cially since the -yala suffix seems fairly common in names of this period, as seen, for example, in the names "Phaguyaa" and "SivayaSa" on the SivayaSa Ayagapata (Appendix no. xxii), and the name "Bhadrayafa" on the Acal  Ayagapata (Appendix no. xx). The -ka suffix is a common suffix that denotes derivation. The word kdlavdtla is difficult to translate, and it has been variously rendered as "black serpent" or as an unknown place name or personal name. However, it probably is best understood as an occu- pation, since a word denoting a profession occurs in this syntactical position in other inscriptions. It possibly refers to a seller or distiller of wine (Sanskrit kalyavdla, kalyapdla, or kallavdla). However, 125 Ibid., 2oo, no. 5; Smith, op. cit., 25.; and Liiders' List no.

The word at the beginning of the second line and immediately preceding kosikiye, may be "bhaydye" or "wife," as has been suggested, but we cannot be sure whether it was another relational word such as daughter or daughter-in-law, etc., since this word has entirely disappeared. xxiv.

Translation: "... (this) [dyd]gapata (was set up for the sake of honoring the) arhats" Notes: Pujaye would have probably followed arahata on the next line. Thus this part of the fragmen- tary inscription was probably parallel to the closing line of the Amohini Ayavati inscription (SML J.I, above, no. xv). xxv.

(pra)tis.thdpito Translation: "... was set up by -tusikad." Notes: The -ye ending is instrumental, and therefore "-tusika" may have formed the ending of a woman's name, perhaps the name of the donor, the second half of whose name is based on the San- skrit root \/tus, "to please". Alternatively, "-tusikd" (Sanskrit -tusikad) may also form the last three akaras of vaitusika, which refers to a type of hermit ascetic or sanydsin. Vaitusika hermits may be either Buddhist or Jaina, and they are mentioned in texts dating to the last several centuries B.c., such as the Baudhdyana Dharmasutra (333, 337). "-s.thdpito" (sic) is the remains of pratisthdpito, a past passive participle meaning "was set up" or "established." 127 Liiders, "Seven Brahmi Inscriptions from Mathura and its Vicinity," Epigraphia Indica XXIV, 204, footnote. 3. 133</page><page sequence="56">xxvi.
