<plain_text><page sequence="1">[ 17 ] 2 TWO RING-FORTS AT GARRYDUFF, CO. CORK By MICHAEL J. O'KELLY Plates I-XX [Read 8 May, 1961. Published 31 January, 1963] The two ring-forts which are described here lie on a prominent knoll in the range of hills which divides the eastern part of Cork Harbour from a rich agricul tural hinterland extending northward to include the valleys of the rivers Bride and Blackwater. Nearby modern towns are Fermoy, twelve miles to the north west, and Midleton, nine miles to the south. The knoll commands extensive views to the north over the river valleys mentioned and this may have been a determining factor in the siting of the structures, especially as there are the remains of three other ring-forts within the towniand, which occupy less com manding positions. \ The sites were excavated in the summers of 1945 and 1947 and short prelim inary reports on Garryduff I were published in Antiquity, XX (1946), 122-6, and in the Journal of the Cork Historical and Arch ological Society, LI (1946), 164-9. For convenience of reference the two structures have been called Garryduff I and Garryduff II. Garryduff I produced not only structural information, but also a large number of finds, some of which are of considerable interest, while the closely adjacent Garryduff II yielded no finds but provided clear evidence of an unusual type of entrance. Garryduff I will be dealt with first and will be followed by the report on Garryduff II. GARRYDUFFI This^site was first brought to notice when some objects from it were presented to the Museum at University College, Cork, by the landowner, Mr. W. O'Mahony, who had become interested in the structure and who had dug some trial holes within the enclosure in the hope of finding a souterrain. From Mr. O'Mahony's description of the nature of the soil in the holes which he had made it was clear that there was a considerable habitation deposit on the site, and since one of the finds made by him was a fragment of post-Roman pottery, it appeared likely that f?ll excavation would give useful results. As will appear below, our hopes in this regard were justified. The ring-fort lies on the highest point of the eastern end of the knoll at a height of 531 feet O.D.1 It thus occupies a commanding position and can be 1 Its exact position will.be found on the O.S. 6" scale sheet Cork no. 55, W: 1-2; N: 14*1 cm.

It overlooks such an extensive terrain that its site may have been chosen because of this very fact, though as will appear below, so little was found in the way of arms or weapons that purely military considerations cannot have been the dominant influence in the minds of the builders of the fort. Before excavation the structure had the appearance of an earthwork^-no stone building showed anywhere in the rounded profiles of its bank and there was no evidence of collapsed stonework in the partly filled up external ditch (pis. I and II). The entrance was on the east, a simple gap in the bank lying opposite what appeared to be a causeway across the ditch. While the ditch and external face of the bank supported a dense growth of coarse vegetation, the interior was a smooth, grass-covered, bowl-shaped, hollow. The whole of the interior was excavated quadrant by quadrant, sections were cut through the defences and the entrance area was fully exposed. Soon after jr^e commencement of the work it became obvious that we were: dealing not with an earthwork as we had at first supposed, but with a stone-built structure surrounded by a rock-cut ditch. The bank had consisted of an outer and an inner stone facing with a rubble core. The Bank Complete excavation revealed the following sequence of events in the original construction of the bank. The position of the ditch was first set out and the turf and humus over this area were stripped off and piled inside the inner edge of the cutting. This is clearly shown in all the sectional profiles by a considerable thickening of the old turf in this position (pi. II, northern profile^ layer A). The builders next excavated some rock (red sandstone shale) which they threw up and spread out to level off an annular area or platform on which the rampart was to be built (pi. 11^ northern profile, layer B). Because of the natural slopes on the north and south the platform is thickest on these sides. This was now covered with a layer of soil and finely broken rock chips,.which, if not trampled down deliberately, received a considerable amount of trampling during the construction of the bank (pi. II, northern profile, layer C). Some courses of the inner facing of the rampart were then laid down on the platform and more excavated rock was thrown up behind them (pi. II, northern profile, layer D). When this had risen to a height of about 2' 6 * (measured behind the inner facing), it was again trampled down, as is shown by a band of fine compact material containing some soil (pi. II, northern profile, layer E). Further courses of the inner facing were then laid and the same process repeated. The outer facing was well preserved on the south where it was built about 5' inside the outer edge of the rock-chip platform, thus creating a sort of berm along this si4e of the ring-fort. The facing had completely collapsed on the west and east, but that it had formerly existed was clear from the fact that the ditch contained many stones of the type used in the facings elsewhere. The ditch on the north contained fewer stones and so it is possible that an outer face had never been built on this side. On the other hand, the modern field fences around the site and especially the fence built on the counterscarp bank around the whole of the</page><page sequence="3">O'Kell y?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 19 southern half of the fort, had stone facings some of which may well have come from the bank. The bank as thus constructed had a thickness of 13' 6" on the south (where both faces were preserved), but on the west it may have been greater, for here the core of rock chips had a maximum thickness of 21' 6\ Where best preserved the internal face was 4' high and the external face 4' 6". A curious feature of the bank was the occurrence in its core of the bands of finer material. On first glance these appeared to be turf-lines and as such, suggested that the bank had been built in stages with intervals between the various periods of building. This prob lem has, however, been discussed at length elsewhere2 and it has been shown that they cannot be regarded as turf-lines and that hence, while the rampart was built in stages as suggested above, there was no interval of any consequence between the stages. A further feature of interest was that the old turf-line under the bank and indeed, also under the whole fort, had a marked blue-grey colour with, in places, a strong purple tint. It was wet and sticky and very clay-like to the touch. This unusual colour of the stratum was undoubtedly due to a chemical action which had taken place subsequent to the building of the fort and was not a deliberately laid floor of specially procured material, as has been suggested in the case of other monuments.3 The quality of the building work was excellent in those portions of the rampart facings which had remained undisturbed (pi. IV, a, b; pi. VI, b). The stone used was mainly of two kinds?small, thin flat pieces of the red sandstone shale which had been quarried from the ditch and boulders of a greenish sand stone, also of local origin. From the northern side of the entrance all the way around to a point on the N.W. (A on plan, pi. Ill), the facing stones were exclus ively of the green stone, though chips of the red shale were used as spalls for bedding and levelling (pi. IV, a). This same form of building had been used for a distance of 18 feet southward from the entrance to point B (plan, pi. III). From B around to C on the south-west the small flat pieces of shale had been used almost exclusively. At B there was a very clearly marked junction of the two styles of masonry (pi. IV, b). This was not a vertical joint and there was no evidence to suggest that it should be taken as indicating a later repair. Because of the way in which the green stone overlapped the shale-building it would appear that the shale portion had been completed first. It may mean, however, that there were two groups of men, each of them favouring different kinds of raw materials, though it is more likely that as soon as all the conveniently collectable green stone had been used up the builders took to using the larger pieces of shale which had been already quarried from the ditch and which lay about under their hands. As the plan (pi. Ill) shows, however, there was on the western side of the fort a very curious joint in the masonry of the facing at D. It is possible to 2 See O'Kelly: " Some Soil Problems in Archaeological Excavation " in f.C.H.A.S., LVI (1951), 29 f?. 8 See O'Kelly: ibid.</page><page sequence="4">20 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy interpret the evidence of this feature in two ways?on the one hand to show that there were two periods of building, on the other that there were three. It will be seen below that the two-period interpretation fits in well with the observed fact that there were two periods of occupation within the fort itself. Two-period Interpretation The lower part of the face from A to D consisted of a foundation course of green stone over which, to a height of 1' 6* to 2', the building was in shale (PL V, a, b). From C to D the building was in a mixture of green stone and shale (pi. V, b). These two runs of wall were not, however, in a continuous line?CD overlapped AD at D, and there was no bonding of the stones at this point (pi. VI, a). This shows that CD (at the point D at any rate) is later than AD, but since the primary habitation deposit rested directly on the surface of the rock-chip platform on which the walls were built and ran to the bases of both but not under the base of CD, there can have been no appreciable interval between the building of AD and CD. Though this was a curious way to effect the junction of two pieces of wall built at approximately the same time, the absence of habita tion refuse under CD seems to rule out the possibility that CD was a repair or a re-building effected during the primary occupation of the fort. If, then, these two pieces of wall, AD and CD, be regarded as being approximately contempor aneous and belonging to the primary period, the second period is represented by the wall XYZ which is unquestionably later than ADCB. The XYZ wall was built after the upper part of ADCB had collapsed and on the west and south sides of the fort was set behind the line of the original face (plan, pi. Ill and pi. VII). Furthermore, the sectional profiles show (pi. II) that the secondary habitation deposit ran over the collapse of the original face to stop at the base of the newly-built XYZ wall. Thus the latter is securely related to the second period of the fort. Three-period Interpretation If, on the other hand, the curious junction of AD and CD at D is taken as an objection to the interpretation suggested, allowance must be made for the possibility that AD represents the first period, CD a second period and XYZ a third; but such a three-period interpretation does not fit with the two-period occupation of the fort as a whole as indicated by the habitation deposits. The upper habitation deposit overlay the collapse of the entrance to the fort, a fact which shows that at the time of this second occupation a defensive entrance was no longer necessary. Why, then, was the bank face rebuilt on the XYZ line at this time ? It seems probable that this was done merely to give shelter to the occupants from the south and west winds. The Entrance Unfortunately, both ends of the bank at the entrance were extensively destroyed. On the south side the inner-face, jamb-face and outer-face were completely erone and though the rubble core was much collapsed, it was possible</page><page sequence="5">O'Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 21 to determine the line followed by the built facings. The north side was in a similar condition except that a few stones of the foundation course of the jamb face were still in position. While a considerable portion of the stones collapsed from the facings were found overlying the primary habitation deposit, some of them had been removed. Perhaps they had been used for the XYZ rebuilding of the inner face of the bank along the west and south of the fort as explained above. This rebuilding seems to have been done more to provide shelter than as a fortification. Nothing is known, therefore, of any special features which the built jambs may have had. Here, as elsewhere, the bank had been built on the platform of rock chip pings, the edge of which had been held in place on the north side of the entrance by a roughly laid stone revetment. Such a revetment was necessary here because of the steepness of the natural slope towards the entrance passage and down to the ditch on the outside. Only the four stones of this revetment which had remained in their original positions are shown on tHe plan (pi. III). This revetting of the edge of the rock chip platform had again the effect of creating a five-foot wide berm on the north side of the entrance. j The entrance passage itself was somewhat asymmetrical in its general relationship to the enclosure. The thickness of the northern jamb was 10' while that of the southern was 12' 6". It will be observed from the plan (pi. Ill) that the passage was wider (9') at the outer than at the inner end (4'). The external width was, however, narrowed to an effective width of about 5' by the placing of two substantial posts (P and Q, plan, pi. Ill), one on either side of the outer end of the passage. Post-hole P had a diameter of 2' (depth 2' 4") while Q measured 1' 6" in diameter (depth 2' 2"). These two holes were joined together by a clearly-marked trench running across the passage. This had an average width of-Vsand a depth of 1' 3". It seems reasonable to conclude that this trench had held a wooden threshold log against or upon which the bottom of a wooden gate rested. Whether this was a hinged gate, hung on one post and closing against the other, or a shutter-like contrivance which could be erected and placed against the posts and threshold log (to be held in place by wooden spars fitting into slots in the jambs), there was no means of determining. Running outward (that is to the east) from the holes P and Q were two short trenches (average width and depth V and 9" respectively) each ending in a post-hole (R and S). R measured V 5" in diameter and V 4" in depth, while S was V 9" in diameter and depth. The trenches must represent wooden palis ades which served to narrow the entrance passage still further since the distance between their outer ends was approximately 4'. This arrangement of lateral palisades would have made it more difficult for a body of attackers to rush the gateway. Leading southward from post-hole S was a further trench (average width and depth 1' 3"). While this may have held tall posts forming a further pro tective palisade on this side of the entrance, it may be that the timbers which it contained were short stakes put down to prevent slip of the foundation course of the stone facing. The gate and palisades were evidently intended to form a strong</page><page sequence="6">22 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy entrance. The entrance stood opposite an uncut causeway of rock lying between the ends of the ditch. The latter were so cut that the causeway became wider towards the outside (pi. I) where it was 16' across. Measured at the inner edge of the ditch-ends it was 11' wide. The Ditch Though the ditch was everywhere rather wide and though there was a rather steep upward slope from its inner edge to the base of 'the bank, it was not a very deep cutting anywhere except for a short distance on the northern side of the entrance causeway. Shallow though it was, it added something to the defensive strength of the ring-fort, but in the main it was more in the nature of a quarry ditch (to provide material for the core of the bank) than a specially provided addition to the defences. "' The sectional profile varied considerably from place to place. Just north of the entrance it had a rathef flat-bdttomed U-shape 17' wide at the top, 12' 6" at the bottom and 6' deep (maximum). On the south of the entrance it was 17' 6" wide but had a depth of only 1' 6". On the west the width of the rock-cut portion was 17' and at this point the depth was 4' ; on the south, width 17' 6", maximum depth 3' 6"; on the north, width 17' 6", depth 4'. The greater depth arid inore deliberate cutting of the ditch on the north of the entrance may be an indication that the work commenced here, perhaps finishing on the south side of the entrance. By the time this point was reached, probably enough of quarried filling for the bank had become available and so a shallow cutting was sufficient. Even though the ditch was not unduly deep the building up of the rock-chip platform, coupled with the natural conformation of the ground, gave a remark able height between the bank top and the ditch bottom. This measurement was greatest on the south where it was 19'; on the north and wests sides it was 18' 6"; while to the south of the entrance it was 12' 6". If allowance is made for the amount of denudation and collapse which had taken place it will be. seen that the structure must originally, have presented a formidable appearance. In quarrying the ditch picks of some kind were used for everywhere pick marks were visible in the rock and in numerous quarried chips in the bank filling. The Interior of the Fort Complete excavation of the interior revealed the rather irregular shape of the enclosed space which was neither oval nor circular and it could be seen that the entrance was asymmetrically placed. Measured to the built facings, the maximum diameter (in a north-east south-west direction) was found to be 06 feet. There had been two main periods of occupation of the site?the primary period, which began immediately after the fort had been built, and the secondary, after a partial collapse of the inner face of the bank had taken place- These two periods were indicated by dense black layers of habitation refuse clearly separated from one another in the area near the bank by the material collapsed from the face (see sectional profiles, pi. II), less easy to differentiate, from one another over the central area of the enclosure. IndWd in this central area the</page><page sequence="7">O'Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 33 two layers could be distinguished only where thin spreads of brown soil containing small chips of stone from the collapsed bank-filling had spread inward over the fort, or where pavements occurred which, from their stratigraphical position in the profile, could not possibly belong to the primary period. Though there cannot have been a long interval between the two occupations, it will be convenient to deal with the features of each period separately. The structural remains of both periods are shown on the one plan for it is likely that at least parts of the principal domestic structures of period I continued to stand above ground during period II. PERIOD II The surviving features of this upper stratum are fragmentary and unsatis factory. They consist of three areas of paving along the south and south-east sides of the enclosure (plan, pi. III). A rectangular hearth with stone slab surround is associated with one of these, while two other isolated hearths occur, one in the north-west which had a square setting of slabs, the other in the south-east, semicircular in form. These pavements and hearths suggest dwelling floors which may have been huts, but owing to the softness and intense blackness of the soil post-holes could not be identified with any degree of reliability except where a stone packing had been used; so while it is probable that the hearths and pavements represent huts, there is little in the way of definite post-hole evidence which can be brought forward in support of this contention. Of the two hearths in the south and south-east, the rectangular example was very carefully surrounded with stone slabs set on edge and the floor of the space enclosed was cobbled over with small stones. It had seen considerable use for not only were its stones well cracked from the heat, but the burnt material was allowed to accumulate within it until the stone surround was completely hidden and the ash and charcoal had spread over the surrounding area. Internally the hearth measured Y 6" by Y 3" and the maximum depth of burnt material associated with it was 8." The maximum dimensions of the paved area immediately north of the hearth were 8' 6" by 7' and though the slabs of shale used were rather roughly laid, they constituted a good floor. Near the north-west corner of the pavement there was a single but very definite post-hole which measured 1' both in depth (from the pavement surface) and in diameter. There must have been other post-holes around this floor, but as explained, they could not be identified despite ? careful search. The hearth and pavement rested on the surface of the material collapsed inward from the-bank,-while the post-hole at the north-west edge of the pavement passed through the tail-off of this layer and down into the surface of the primary habitation deposit. It is quite clear, therefore, that this living-floor belonged to the secondary period of the fort. The semicircular hearth in the south-east quadrant was again resting on the surface of the collapse from the bank, therefore it also belonged to the secondary</page><page sequence="8">24 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy period. The stone setting was heavily burnt and heat-cracked. It consisted of small slabs set on edge having a dimension of 3' across the horns of the arc The charcoal layers which filled it spread out over the stones on all sides.and had a maximum depth of 7". There were no post-holes or other features associa ated with it. To the north-west of the semicircular hearth, but still in the sputh-east quadrant, there was a square area of pavement measuring 7' by 7', the eastern edge of which formed a straight line running north and south. At the north a^. south corners of its western margin were-two post-holes marked by stone slabs set on edge. Several of the stones used in this pavement were slabs of shal?, some of them having maximum dimensions of over 2'. The slabs were again laid on the tail-off of the inward collapse from the bank and so the pavement belongs, to the secondary period. Some 10' in from and a little to the south of the southern jamb of the entrance passage there occurred another small area of well-laid paving. This had $ maximum dimension of 4'. It was embedded in the upper layer of habitation refuse which here, as elsewhere, was of a dense black colour and contained char coal and animal bones. No hearth or post-holes were associated with it and it is impossible to say whether or not it formed part of a hut floor. In the north-west quadrant at a point 8' inside the bank-facing there was an isolated, but well-constructed, hearth of approximately square plan. It was constructed of four stone slabs set on edge having an overall dimension of 1' 6*' each way. The hearth was filled with, charcoal and- ash to the level of the tops; of the slabs. The structure lay on the surface of the collapse from the bank and it therefore belonged to the secondary period of occupation. When the habitation refuse which surrounded it had been removed and the surface of the underlying collapse Jhad been cleaned, a careful search was made for post-holes, but none were found. It is possible that this was a hearth at which open-air cookery was done. The upper habitation layer with which the features described were associated everywhere ran up over the collapse of the bank-facing and on to the body of the bank itself. On the west and south sides tnis deposit terminated at the base of the rebuilt face 1?YZ, but elsewhere tailed-off irregularly along the sloping surface of the rock chippings forming the core of the bank. In the entrance area it wa&amp; clear that the jambs had fully collapsed before the secondary occupation began for the upper habitation deposit overlay the collapsed material and spread over the bank core on either side of the original opening. It is clear from this that the secondary occupants had no need for a defensive wall around their huts since there was no attempt at a rebuilding of the entrance. The rebuilding of the , inner face on the XYZ line must have been done, therefore, to provide shelter rather tharr to re-fortify the enclosure.</page><page sequence="9">O'Kell y?Two Ring-forts at Garry duff, Co. Cork 25 PERIOD I In period I two houses had been built within the enclosure, both of them free-standing structures occupying most of the central area. House I This house occupied the west central area and its main supports consisted of wooden posts. The habitation deposit (containing animal bones and numerous objects) which covered all of this area gave no clue as to the nature of the walls of this structure. If they had been of stone, turves or mud, some evidence of these materials should have remained in the ground when the final collapse or abandonment took place. If the walls had been of wattle and daub little evidence of this would remain unless the house had been destroyed by fire, in which case some of the baked or burnt clay might be expected to survive. In the absence of any of these evidences one can only suggest that the material used was of such a perishable nature as to leave no identifiable trace. If the walls had been of timber this material would have decayed away or perhaps it was removed after abandonment of the site. There was also the further difficulty that the plan of the house could not be recovered despite the fact that numerous post-holes were found. The softness and intense blackness of the deposit here made it impossible to distinguish the primary and secondary deposits from one another as there was no change in its character from the surface of what must have been the secondary deposit down to the old ground-level. Post-holes could be recognized with certainty only when they had penetrated the old ground surface. It is certain that all of the post holes shown are not of the same age?some of them must have been dug down into the old ground surface from higher levels when repairs and rebuildings of the house were carried out. The result is that we are left with a collection of post-holes which do not form a sensible plan. By selecting certain holes and excluding others one can arrive at a number of plans, but since none of these can be definitely identified as the original plan, the question of the shape of the house must remain indeterminate. On the plan, pi. Ill, we have enclosed the post-hole area within a dotted line. Within the post-hole area there was a hearth of approximately circular shape almost 5' in diameter. There were no stone settings as in the case of the three secondary period hearths. The first fire had been lighted directly on the old ground surface and the hearth had gone on in use for a considerable time as the ash and charcoal had built up to a thickness of 14" suggesting that it may still have been in use when period II began. In turn this would suggest that the period I house was still standing and that it was occupied or re-occupied at this time. Several very small post-holes occurred around the margin of the hearth. These may have held pot hangers of some kind. Just north of the hearth there was a rectangular rubbish pit with rounded corners measuring 3' 6" by 2' 6" by 1' deep measured from the old ground surface. A number of small finds came from</page><page sequence="10">26 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy it including a few fragments of pottery. Outside the western margin of the post-hole area there was another rubbish pit of irregular shape. It had a maxi mum diameter of 4' and a depth (from O.G.L.) of 9". Two post-holes had been made in the northern end of it. House II House II stood to the east of House I and was also built of posts. It is marked by a smaller number of post-holes and all of them almost certainly belong to the earliest phase of the occupation. They are cut deeply into the undisturbed ground. Unlike House I, the plan has not been confused by the insertion of extra posts in the course of repair or rebuilding and so it is clear that the structure was a rectangle, the long axis of which lay north and south. The overall dimensions are about 21' by 10'. The arrangement of the posts is rather peculiar. Near the centre of the floor are three large post-holes set in a line and so close together as almost to form a trench. The depth and diameter in each case is 2'. The northern end of the house is marked by two holes approximately 7' 6" north of the central three. These are V 6* deep and Y in diameter. At 8' south of the central three are two more large holes (!' diameter, 15" deep) which perhaps formed the main supports of the south wall, while 2' 6* south of these are three smaller holes (8* diameter, depth 1'). Apart from these, there are only four other holes, two which are asymmetrically placed in the floor of the southern half of the house and two which He in the line of the western wall of the northern half. The greater part of the floor of the southern half of the house was covered by a paving set directly on the old ground surface. The hearth was also in the southern half of the house near the north-east corner of this area. The first fire had been lighted on the old ground surface, but as the deposit built up it spread on to the edge of the adjacent paved area. The maximum diameter of the hearth was 2' 6* and the depth of the deposit was 7*. A small fragment of paving remained in the south-east corner of the northern half of the house. Again, there is little evidence as to the nature of the walls except for those on the west and north of the northern half. Here the old ground surface was covered by a thin spread of redish brown soil containing many small pebbles. The nature of this layer was such as to suggest a wall of gravelly mud or turves which had collapsed and had been washed down to form the deposit as found. It is not easy to visualize the original form of this house, but it may be assumed that it had a low thatched roof of rather rounded form supported on the three main centre-posts and the four corner-posts. The three southern posts may have formed a sort of portico or pent-house at this end of the building. Gravelled Entrance Passage A considerable area stretching from the eastern side of this house right down through the entrance passage as far as the edge of the trench, which may have held the threshold log, was covered by a 3" layer of water-rolled gravel cobbling</page><page sequence="11">O'Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garry duff, Co. Cork 27 laid on and trafnpled well into the old ground surface. This was evidently done so as to provide a hard dry passage through the entrance and into the centre of the enclosure. Two Low Standing Stones Two low standing stones were found in the enclosure, one 5' inside the bank face near the entrance and the other almost diametrically opposite and 6' in?ide the bank face at the west. Both were set in sockets dug into the old ground surface, and their bases were packed with soil and not with stones. The eastern stone had been set in position before the gravel cobbling was laid. It measured 3' 9" by 9" on plan and was 2' 8" high. The western stone measured 1' 3" by 9'' by 2' 6" high. There was no obvious explanation for these stones and it may be that they were put down as markers in the original setting out of the site. THE FINDS The finds are grouped under the materials from which they are made?-gold, bronze, iron, stone, etc. It has been pointed out that there were two occupation levels within the ring-fort, a fact which became clear at the beginning of the excavation. A careful note was kept, therefore, of the occupation level from which each object came, and in the descriptive catalogue which follows the finds from the lower layer, i.e., Period I, are dealt with first in each group and are iollowed immediately by those from the upper layer (Period II) in trie same material. It is hoped that this arrangement will enable comparisons between the Period I and II objects to be made more easily than would be the case if two completely separate lists were made. It will be noticed that the majority of the finds came from the upper level and therefore belong to Period II. GOLD Bird Ornament (pi. VIII, fig. 1) This ornament was the only object in gold from the site and though very small in size (maximum dimension 14 mm.) it is of special interest from several points of view. It was found near the centre of the enclosure embedded deeply in the old turf below the base of the black habitation deposit a little to the south of the south-east corner of House I. It could only have come into this position by having been dropped on and trampled into the ground at or before the beginning of the occupation of the site, for the primary and secondary habitation deposits were clearly distinguishable from each other here because of the presence between them of a thin layer of brown sterile gravelly soil representing the tail-off of the inward extension of the material which collapsed from the bank at the end of period I.</page><page sequence="12">28 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy The ornament is in the form of a bird?the short outline and the upward quirk of the tail suggest that it was meant to represent a wren. It is ingeniously made from a thin plate or foil of gold the central area of which is beaten up to a concavo-convex form so as.to suggest the /'roundness" of the bird's body. A strip all around the raised or convex portion is left flat. On the front a rope motif occupies the whole of this flat strip?two lines of beaded wire with, between them, a twist composed of two strands of beaded wire. That this is a two-strand twist can be seen with certainty for a short distance at the top of the bird's head. Elsewhere, the solder is so thick that it obscures the underneath strand and makes it appear that the rope effect was achieved by the use of single short lengths of beaded^wire set diagonally. The line of separa tion between the upper and lower parts of "the beak is marked by a straight length of beaded wire, while theTegs (?) or ends of the wings (?) are suggested by triangles edged with beaded wire which project beyond the line of the body. The convex area within the rope motif contains five S-scrolls in beaded wire, neatly fitted together to fill this rather awkward space. Each of the three scrolls occupying the area nearest the beak has a large and a small spiral, while the spirals in the remaining two scrolls are all of the same size. The central knop of one large spiral appears to have been positioned so as to represent the bird's eye. Where the wire comes to the centre of the spiral its end is recurved on itself to create the knop that is found in each scroll in this position. The solder does not fill the little loop formed by this recurvature so that each spiral has a central dot or " eye." It is abundantly clear that the whole of this decoration is filigree work, that is a soldering on of the beaded wire to the surface of the plate; where two of the scrolls have suffered damage (in antiquity) the connecting part between a large and a small spiral has lifted slightly from the backing, and the similar portion between the adjacent spirals has been severed and one^end of the break stands clear of the surface of the plate. The solder, which was run in t? fasten the wire to the plate, evidently consists of an alloy of copper and gold for where it can be clearly seen its colour is much redder than that of the gold itself. Where the relief is high the beading has been worn off the outwarcj surface of the wire, though it remains on the lateral surfaces. In the lower areas and in sheltered hollows the beading has remained well preserved and it can be seen that the beaded effect was achieved by some means such as rolling the wire on a surface on which very closely-set and very fine parallel grooves had been made., The beads are not blobs of metal attached one by one to the wire. The wearing down of the beading shows that the ornament was exposed to a light rubbing, perhaps against a fold of a garment or against some other part of the wearer's clothing. The concave area at the back of the ornament has airelongated^oval outline. A narrow strip of gold foil was bent around on itself to a tube-like form of sectional outline similar to that of the concavity and a length of very fine plain gold wire was tied around the outside of the " tube " so that it should keep this shape and not open or unbend itself. One end of the tube was then inserted into the concave hollow and gold-solder was run in to make it a permanent fixture.</page><page sequence="13">O'Kelly?Two Ringrforts at Garryduff,Co.

Some of the tongues have broken off in antiquity and others ^re damaged but, nevertheless, this structural arrangement can be seen when the object is studied under high magnification. BRONZE Period I Objects The number of bronze objects from the lower level, that is from Period I, is small, but some of them are not without interest '. They have come from all parts of the interior but particularly from the vicinity of the two house structures. Disc Pin (fig. 2, no. 121) This object when first uncovered was in bad condition, but it could be seen that it consisted of a short pin to the loop head of which had been fitted a loose disc. The drawing was made before attempting to remove the object from the soil. It was found that the disc was reduced^to little more than a green stain and it proved impossible to take either the pin or the disc from the soil whole. Both are now in a fragmentary condition. The overall length of the pin is approxi mately 7-5 cm. The loop appears to have been made by flattening the upper end of the pin and bending over to shape. Internal diameter of loop, 5 rnm. The disc was quite plain and approximately -5 mm. thick-while its diameter was 3 cm. A D-shaped hole had been made in it near the edge through which the loop of the pin had been passed before closing; thus the disc was loosely held to the head, of the pin. Disc Pin (fig. 2, no. 285) Similar to the last except that the pin is well preserved while no part of the disc remains. As before, the details of the object were recorded before removal from the ground as it was obvious that the disc could not survive disturbance. The pin is 6-5 cm. long overall and as before, the loop at the head is^formed by a flattening and bending over of the metal. The loop is somewhat smaller (at 3 mm.) than that of no. 121. The lower end of the pin is neatly flattened and curved forward, presumably to give it a better grip when thrust-into the clothing. Th? disc appeared to be much the same as that of no. 121, its diameter being somewhat less at 2-5 cm. Armstrong illustrates4 a group of closely comparable pins with thin plain discs such as those of our two examples. He regarded them as being " derived from the contemporary annular brooches " and he claimed that his " illustrations 4 Arch ologia, LXXII (1921-22), 77 and fig. 1, nos. 13-20.</page><page sequence="15">O'Kell y?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 31 show the gradual deterioration of the type in which the aperture becomes reduced until the pin-head loses its brooch-like pin, becoming a thin metal disc attached to a stem." One of the pins illustrated by him (his fig. 1, no. 18) is said to have come from one of the Strokestown crannogs, Co. Roscommon. Ring Pin (fig. 2, no. 123) The pin, poorly preserved, has an overall length of 8 cm. approximately. The head was heavily corroded and so its detail was not determinable but presum ably it was similar to other ring pins (to be described below) which came from the upper or Period II level. The ring is of " key-ring " type?that is, a piece of wire shaped to a spiral form. Armstrong5 has called it the " double-ring " type. The surface of the wire forming the ring is milled, that is, covered with fine, close-set, parallel grooves except in that part of it which passed through the hole in the head of the pin. As indicated, Armstrong figures four pins of this type which he would date to the early sixth century. Lagore6 has produced a number of examples of the type and one of them has been placed in Period I of that site and dated to the seventh century. Two examples have come from Carraig Aille II, dated eighth-tenth century,7 and more recently one has been found at the Letterkeen ring-fort in Co. Mayo.8 In the discussion of the latter the excavators discount the late evidence from Carraig Aille II and " accept a fairly early date for the Letterkeen ring-pin?probably about the seventh century." Mrs. Alison Young suggests a seventh-eighth century date for a similar Scottish pin.9 Ring Pin (no. 157, not illustrated) Only a part of this object had survived. The point of the pin had disappeared completely by reason of corrosion as also had the loose ring or disc (see nos. 121, 285 and 123 above) which must originally have been held in the head. The latter is formed by flattening the bronze and then bending round to form a circular loop or eye. This portion of the object is also heavily corroded. A feature of several of the pins from Garryduff, one which apparently is not common in the pins from other Irish sites, though it can be seen in bone examples at Lagore and in various pins from the recently excavated site at Dooey, Co. Donegal,10 is that they exhibit a swelling at a point roughly midway along the shank, presumably to ensure that the pin would have a better grip when thrust into the clothing. The feature is present in the example under discussion, though it is not as 6 Arch ologia, LXXII (1921-22), 75 and pi. XII, fig. 1, nos, 2, 6, 8 and 9. ? Hencken, P.R.I.A., LUI, C (1950), 72. 7 ?

Cork 33 strongly marked as in some others from the site.11 The overall length of the surviving portion is 6*3 cm. ; diameter of shank 3 mm., and 3*5 mm. at swelling. It was found in the lowest part of the habitation refuse just over the old ground level near the post-hole area in the south-west quadrant of the site. Two Rings (fig. 2, no. 368) These are small, somewhat roughly made, and are of the " key-ring " or spiral form. Both came from the old ground-level within the enclosure, one from the northern area (fig. 2, no. 368) and the other (no. 160, not illustrated) from the western side; both unquestionably belong to the earliest period of the site. They are simply made from bronze wire 1*5 mm. thick. The ends of the wire in each example are reduced in thickness so that the ring should not be over bulky where the overlap takes place. These rings are similar to two others (fig. 2, nos. 541 and 542) and to that in pin no. 489 (see below), though the milled decoration is absent. Diameters 10 and 13 mm., respectively. Ring (no. 124, not illustrated) Small bronze ring, originally continuous in form but now broken at one point. It is not clear how it was made, but it seems to have been cut out of sheet bronze. Its section is thin and flat and even if large enough, which it is not (internal diameter, 14 mm.), it could not have been worn comfortably as a finger ring. It is 1 mm. broad by *5 mm. thick. Found in the refuse just above old ground-level, near the post-hole area in the south-west quadrant. Mount (fig. 3, no. 546) This object, made of thin sheet bronze, was found in a number of fragments which can be fitted together. Only a small portion is missing. Its form will best be understood by looking at the illustration. The curves of its outline are not arranged symmetrically and it is clear that the object was not fitted to a strap end. Three of the original four rivets are present and, having passed through the object and through the material to which it was affixed, each pair was then passed through a strip of bronze before clinching. One of these strips survives and the fact that it is out of place shows that the object had been detached from the leather or cloth (to which it had been affixed) and broken before it was lost. It is difficult to say what purpose the object served. Period II Objects A much greater number of bronze objects came from the upper or Period II level than from the lower. As was the case with the Period I objects, those from the upper level came from most parts of the interior of the fort, but particularly from within and around the post-hole area. 11 A somewhat similar feature is to be seen on a bronze pin from Lagore. See Hencken : P.R.I.A., LUI, C (1950), fig. 14, no. 216. Stevenson has suggested that the swelling may have a late Roman or fifth-century origin?cf. P.P.S., XXI (1955), 282-294. c</page><page sequence="18">34 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Ring Pin (fig. 2, no 491) Though somewhat corroded, no. 491 is a good example of this type of ring pin. The upper portion of the head has been dissolved away and there are spots of heavy corrosion on the shank and on one half of the ring. Despite the damage to the head of the pin, the form of the greater part of it can be seen. More or less square in horizontal section, it terminated above and .below the perforation in circular collars or fillets the surfaces of which were grooved horizontally. A lozenge-shaped panel is produced on each of the two principal faces by'cutting away small triangular areas at the corners (see/fig. 2, no. 491). A third of the way down the shank from the head there is a narrow band of milling composed of four fine, closely-set grooves. Above these th? section of the shank is circular, but immediately below them it becomes square with rounded arrises. This square-sectioned portion swells gradually to a maximum at almost the exact centre of the pin and then decreases, the section becoming circular again towards the point. Below the head the section is 3 mm. in diameter and 4m? at the maximum point of the squared portion. The total present length of the pin is 12-3 cm. The ring is made from a spiral of milled wire arranged in key-ring fashion. The maximum diameter of the section of this is 2-5 mm. and it thins down to slightly less than 2 mm. at both ends. The length of about 1 cm. of the wire which passes through the perforation in the head was left plain, presumably because the milling would have been subject to wear as it jogged about in the perforation. A length of 7 mm. near one end of the spiral is also plain, but this is hardly intentional and it looks as if the craftsman forgot to complete the surface working here. The overall diameter of the ring is 3*3 cm. The pin was found associated with the secondary hearth in the upper habitation level in the north west quadrant of the enclosure. Ring Pin (fig. 2, no. 360) Very similar to the last except that the ring, which is plain and unmilled, is less well preserved and the tip of the pointed end of the pin is gone. The head of the pin is again of the square-sectioned form with lozenge panels on the faces due to the removal of triangles at the corners. The collars or fillets above and below the perforation are square in form and are also grooved horizontally. The perforation is well worn, suggesting that the pin had been in use for a long time, The present overall length is 10-2 cm. The section of the shank is circular throughout, Ipeing 3 mm. in diameter below the head. There is a sudderi swelling to 4 mm. at a point 5-7 cm. below the top of the head and below~this there was a gradual taper to the point. The ring was made from a spiral of plain wire, again arranged in key-ring fashion, and 2 mm. thick at maximum, narrowing to 1 mm. at the ends. Its overall diameter was 2-9 cm. It was found within the post-hole area just below the turf and on the surface of the upper layer of habitation refuse.</page><page sequence="19">O'Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 35 Ring Pin (fig. 2, no. 489) This is smaller and was less well made than the last two examples. Neither was it as well made as was no. 123 from Period I described above. The head o? the pin was, however, clearly the same as nos. 491 and 360, in having the square horizontal section, the lozenge facets and the fillets or collars above and below. The lower collar was certainly grooved and the upper one may have been. The pin is 8-8 cm. in overall length and has a circular section throughout. The diameter below the head is a little under 3 mm., but at a point 44 cm. below the top of the head it suddenly swells to 3*5 mm. after which it tapers off to the point. The ring, which was poorly made, is not circular and is small, 1*6 era. in overall diameter. The milling is again present, but the grooves are more widely spaced than in the examples described so that the effect is rather coarse. It was found at the base of the turf covering the habitation refuse which ran on to the top of the bank at the north-west side and undoubtedly belonged to the latest period of occupation. Rings from Pins (fig. 2, nos. 541, 542) In this group are included five rings or parts of rings which appear to have belonged to pins of the above types. No. 545 is a fragment from a milled ring similar to that in no. 491 (?g. 2) and when complete would have given a ring of approximately 3 cm. in overall diameter. No. 542 is a fragment from a small milled ring similar to that in no. 489 (fig. 2) where the ring is roughly made, is not circular and is small in size; overall diameter, 1-5 cm. No. 541 covers two well preserved plain spiral rings of small size, each 1*3 cm. in overall diameter, and no. 119 is a fragment from a similar ring. All of these have come from just below the turf and from the surface of the habitation deposit in the post-hole area. Ring Pin (fig. 2, no. 375) Only the pin survives here and in many respects it resembles those just described, but is not identical with them. The head has the lozenge facets and has a circular fillet or collar at the point of junction with the shank, but it did not have the upper collar?the head was, as it were, truncated just at the point where the upper collar should have begun. The upper flat surface of the head has a circular depression in its centre, but this is not deep enough to enable it to have been set with any substance such as glass or enamel. The head might be said to be " polygonal " in the sense in which Hencken uses the word in describing some of the pins from Lagore. A closer parallel comes from the Ballinderry II crannog.12 In this example the collar below the head is missing but otherwise it is very similar to the Garryduff pin. It is fitted with a plain ring not of key-ring form. Hencken dates this plain Ballinderry II pin to about 600, though the more elaborate and ornamented ring pin with polygonal head from Ballinderry I crannog is dated to about 1000. The Garryduff pin is likely to have had a plain non-spiral type of ring similar to that of the Ballinderry II pin and not any of the more elaborate types as found at Lagore and elsewhere. 12 Hencken: P.R.I A., XLVII, C (1942), 44 and fig. 18, no. 651.</page><page sequence="20">36 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy The shank of the pin is circular in section throughout. It is 3-5 mm. in diameter below the head but at a point 5*2 cm. below the top of the head the shank suddenly swells to 5 mm. in diameter after which it tapers off to the point. The lower end of the pin is bent upward into a hook (in antiquity) but this seems an accidental feature. It was found below the turf and in the upper part of the latest habitation deposit within the post-hole area. Ring- or Disc-pin (fig. 2, no. 483) This pin is well preserved but the ring or disc which was held in the loop in its head is gone. A disc is allowed for because the form of the loop is the same as that in the disc-headed pins nos. 121 and 285 described above. The loop is formed by flattening the end of the pin and bending it round to form an eye. Thesurface of the loop was. then decorated with incised parallel grooves. There is not much wear on the inside of the loop. The latter is now distorted and is no longer circular, but its original diameter must have been about 6 mm. The shank of the pin has a circular section throughout and is a little over 3 mm. in diameter below the head. At 3-5 mm. below the top of the head there is the usual sudden swelling to little over 4 mm. after which there is a graduaL taper to the point. The overall length is 8 cm. Found just below turf and in the surface of the latest habitation refuse to the north of the post-hole area. Pin (fig. 2, no. 373) This pin is unusual and I have not been able to find any very close parallel for it in the published Irish material. Its form will best be understood from the illustration. It is complete and measures 9-8 cm. overall. The shank of the pin, has a rectangular section throughout, sharply rectangular in the lower part and with rounded arrises in the upper, and almost all surfaces show minute striations which are undoubtedly file marks. That these marks can be so clearly seen suggests that it had not been worn in the clothing very much for even this use/ should have polished out the tool marks in certain parts of the pin if not all along the shank/ It appears, therefore, to have been lost very soon after making. The lower portion, which has a graceful curve, widens gradually to about the mid-point of the whole object and then narrows to form the upper portion which also is curved, though not so strongly. The top of the upper part then widens and thins out in such a manner that it was possible for its artificer to roll it over into a loop or eye. The form of this eye is such that it would not be suitable for taking a loose ring, and the arrises of the eye are sharp and exhibit no trace of the wear which such a ring should have produced. Furthermore, the curvature of the shank is such as to suggest that when thrust into the clothing, the loop or eye would have been at the back and not very visible. The section of the metal at th? point indicated on the drawing is 5 by 2 mm. It was found in the upper habitation layer in the north-west of the enclosure near the post-hole area. The curious curvature of the shank of this pin is reminiscent of the double curvature seen, for instance, in the bone objects called " toilet articles " from Lagore13 and elsewhere. 13 Hencken: P.R.I.A., LUI, C (1950), 191, fig. 103.</page><page sequence="21">O'Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 37 Bronze Pin and Key (fig. 2, no. 5B) These two objects, though not actually joined together when first uncovered, were found very close together in the soil. The key had in its looped head frag ments of a spiral of bronze wire which appeared to be the remains of a " key-ring " formerly holding both together loosely. Both appear to have been made from the same quality of bronze for both have patinated to exactly the same light green colour. The key is of the normal type used with the barrel-padlock and the arrises of its shank are sharp and show no signs of wear. The same is true of the perforated foot?sharp arrises everywhere and none of the scratches or abrasions which one would expect use to have produced. This suggests that after manu facture it may not have been used as a key. One face of its shank has a decoration of three groups of cross-hatched square punch marks. Four of the marks are at the lower end, three a little above the centre and three more just below the end ?f the loop of the head. The overall length of the object is 8 cm. and the section of the shank near the centre point is 3 by 1-5 mm. The pin, originally quite straight, now has some slight irregular bends which appear to be accidental. Its head is looped in exactly the same manner as the head of the key and its section is circular throughout (2-5 mm.) except for a short distance at the point where it has been flattened, the hammering having been done on one side only. This flat area has three cross-hatched, square punch marks similar to but slightly larger than those on the key. Overall length 7-8 cm. One must assume that the key was made for use as a key and that it was linked to the pin so that it could be kept safely by attachment to the clothing. If the pin were thrust through the garment so that the flat punch-decorated end protruded (enabling the decoration to be seen at close quarters at any rate), the ring attachment to the key would have permitted movement sufficient to allow the hole in the key to be passed over the protruding point of the pin, thus converting the whole into a sort of safety brooch. This, of course, would not have prevented the key from being used for its original purpose?the brooch could be opened and taken out at any time?but the similar decoration on both the pin and key suggests that the " brooch potentiality" of both together had been realized. Keys in bronze and of this size and type but without the decoration have come from all periods at Lagore14 and from Lough Faughan Crannog, County Down.15 They appear to be objects which have Roman origins (see similar iron keys below, p. 54). Two Disc-head Pins (?) (fig. 3, nos. 100 and 543) Both of these objects are poorly preserved and so it is not possible to say for certain whether they were pins^or large buttons or some other kind of ornament. If they were pins, they must have had something of the general form of the " sunflower " type?that is, a large disc fixed at its centre to the end of a right "Hencken: P.R.I.A., LUI, C (1950), 80 and fig. 20, nos. 1003 and 1008. 15 Collins: U.J.A., XVIII (1955), 59 and fig. 9, no. 24.</page><page sequence="22">38 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy angle bend at the top of the pin. These two objects are not, however, of bronze throughout?they consist of a bronze disc made from very thin sheet metal set into a concavo-convex iron backing. In no. 100 what appears.to have been the stump of the shank of the.pin remains. Electrolitic action has increased the amount of corrosion but the arrangement of bronze disc and iron backing is quite clear and it is not obscured by the rusting of the iron. The overall diameter of no. 100 is 5-3 cm. while the diameter of the bronze disc itself is 4-7 cm. No. 543 is less well preserved. Its original dimensions cannot be ascertained, though there is no doubt that it also is made from a bronze disc affixed to an iron backing. Both were found in the upper" habitation level in the south-west quadrant within the post-hole area. Finger Ring (fig. 2, no. 347) This object was found not within the fort but in the uppermost level of refuse inthe ditch at the north side of the entrance. It would appear to have been accidentally thrown out with the refuse deposited here. The ring consists of a plain band of circular section. Approaching the bezel, the section becomes oval and leads gracefully to the oval flat which forms the bezel itself. The surface of the oval panel has a decorative design of incised curving lines enhanced by four chip-carved triangles. I have not been able to find a parallel for the ornament, but a ring of identical form and size has come from Lagore.16 In the latter the bezel has a simple incised cross by way of decoration. Diameter of the ring, 2*5 cm. overall ;Tong axis of bezel 1 cm. ; diameter of section of ring, 2 mm. Tweezers (fig. 3, no. 56) This consists of a simple strip of spring bronze bent around to form a small toilet tweezers. Overall length, 4 cm.; width and thickness of metal strip, 4 znm. by 1 mm. It was found in the upper level of refuse in the south-west quadrant of the interior and within the post-hole area. This type of object appears to have Roman origins and the Garryduff example has already been listed by ? Riordain in his paper17 " Roman Material in Ireland," where the Ballinderry ornamented example is also figured. Lagore^8 has produced an example which is also made of strip spring-bronze and is undecorated. This latter is, however, of a somewhat different form to the Garryduff tweezers. Button (fig. 3, no. 585) This consists of a disc of thin sheet bronze *2 mm. thick and 2*6 cm. in diameter. The central area, which is 1-5 cm. in diameter, has been beaten up from the back to a low dome shape. The metal is so thin that it could hardly have.survived in use without some support. Apart from this there are no perforations by means of which it could have been sewn on to the clothing.

Discs from Lagore,19 though in general similar to the Garryduff example, all had perforations for fixing. This was found in the habitation refuse which had run up over the top of the stonework of the bank and hence unquestionably belongs to the latest period of the site. Sewing Needle (not illustrated) About half of this object has survived. The eye for the thread is missing and so it is not certainly a needle but it is so fine and so sharply pointed that a needle seems more likely than any kind of pin. Its present length is 3-8 cm. and the maximum thickness is slightly more than 1 mm. Three needles are known from Lagore, one of them from Period la of that site and there is one well preserved needle from Garranes. The Garryduff example belongs to the last phase of occupation and came from the surface of the refuse in the ditch at the north side of the entrance. Two Loops or Ring-mounts7, (fig. 2, nos. 88 and 289) One of these, no. 88, was in a corroded and fragmentary condition when uncovered, while the other is well preserved. No. 88 was very carefully made, the section of its loop being rectangular with the arrises rounded and polished off. The ends of the loop curved gracefully into the rectangular flats, each of which has a small rivet still in place. The rivets are so short that the loop must have been fixed to a thin bronze sheet rather than to wood or leather. Diameter of loop, 1*2 cm. overall; length of rivets, 3 mm. diameter 1 mm. No. 289 is much less well made, being a mere strip of square-sectioned metal bent to a loop forni'witrftheends turned outward and flattened to take the two very short rivets which still remain. These are counter-sunk in the flats of the loop and likewise were counter-sunk in the thin metal plate ta which the loop was fixed.

Also, the surfaces are rough as they would be to give the tang a good hold in a handle. The broader end, however, exhibits two sloping facets which are clearly the result of chisel cuts. The section is 4 mm. square at the broad end and 2 mm. at the other. 19 P.R.I.A., LUI, C (1950), 83 and fig. 20, no. 1245.</page><page sequence="25">O'Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co.

IRON OBJECTS A very large number of iron objects came to light from all parts of the interior of the enclosure as well as from the entrance area and from the rubbish dump in the ditch at the north side of the entrance. The objects were, for the most part, so heavily corroded as to make cleaning or treatment very difficult. Cleaning was done where possible so as to ensure accurate identification of the objects and so as to permit satisfactory drawings of sections and profiles to be made. Some objects were elaborately treated in an attempt to prevent further decay but despite this, rusting has continued. Since the objects themselves cannot be effectively preserved, a sufficient selection of them has been presented in the drawings herewith. PERIOD I Knives (fig. 4) Eleven knives or parts of knives came from the lower level of occupation and from all areas of the interior of the ring-fort. Owing to the heavy corrosion and to varying amounts of wear from sharpening during use, shapes vary considerably and in many cases it is not possible to be sure what the original form may have been. An attempt at classification of forms would, therefore, be mis leading. In general they are similar to the knives from other sites of comparable age. Three representative examples are given in fig. 4, nos. 138, 298 and 596. The dimensions vary as follows : overall lengths from 68 to 102 mm. ; tang lengths from 22 to 50 mm. ; blade widths from 10 to 15 mm. and blade thickness from 3 to 5 mm. These dimensions have little detail value for the objects have suffered so much from corrosion that they may originally have been larger by several millimetres, but they do serve to give a general impression of size and proportion. The shapes vary considerably also but this seems largely due to the amount of wear which has taken place in use and from repeated sharpenings. One knife illustrated (fig. 4, no. 298) has recognizable traces of a bone haft adhering to its tang.</page><page sequence="26">42 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy PERIOD II Knives (fig. 4) Fifty knives" or parts of knives were found in the upper level of occupation and again came from all parts of the enclosure and from the ditch at the northern side of the entrance. As with the lower-level knives, corrosion and wear from sharpening while in use have made it difficult to ascertain the original forms of several of them though the outlines of others have been reasonably well preserved. A representative selection 'of cthe knives is given in fig. 4. Some, as for instance, no. 512, seem to have had curved &gt;backs and straight cutting-edges while the reverse is true of no. 316. Traces of handles are preserved in a few cases, nos. 27 and 78, the best example being no. 78 in which the handle was clearly of bone. Overall lengths vary from 71 mm. to 147 mm.; tang lengths from 40 mm. to 60 mm.; blade maximum widths from 11 mm. to 22 mm. and blade maximum thicknesses from 3 mm. to 5 mm. ., ' . , Two upper-level knives seem to be different from all others found on the site. They are nos. 292 and 292a (fig. 4). The first has a blade which, in size and shape, is similar to those of the common knives from the site, but in place of the usual tang there are the remains of what appear to be two iron rivets passing through the blade near its butt-end. These may have held it to its haft, but no trace of the latter survives. No. 292a may have been of the same form, but this is not certain as the butt-end of the blade is gone and there is no trace of rivets or tang. In this case the blade is long, 140 ;mrn., and its back edge is gently curved. Its cutting edge is not quite straight, but the slight hollowing may be due to wear from sharpening. Spear-heads (fig. 5, nos. 136, 218, 226 and 492) Two objects which can be recognized with certainty as small iron spear-heads came from the interior of the enclosure, as did also two other fragmentary objects which may be the blades of spear-heads. All are illustrated in fig. 5. PERIOD I This example was found trampled into the old turf near the post-hole area and definitely belongs to the early part of the occupation. It is socketed and has a small leaf-shaped blade (fig. 5, no. 492). Overall length, 127 mm.; length of blade, 66 mm. ; maximum width of blade, 27 mm. ; thickness of blade, 10 mm. Diameter of mouth of socket, 18 mm. An old find from Lagore20 is of similar form to this but is smaller. PERIOD II The second recognizable example is of the same general form a?d size, but is very poorly preserved (fig. 5, no. 136). In fig. 5, no. 218, we illustrate a thin blade which might well be the blade of a knife or small dagger.

There is no trace of tang or socket, but it is more likely to have had a tang. Length, 73 mm. ; maximum width, 22 mm. ; thickness, 4 mm. This was found in the surface of the upper habitation deposit where this ran over the edge of the built inner face of the enclosing bank. No. 226 (fig. 5) is a fragment of a similar object, though the blade was broader and in general, bigger. It is impossible to say if this was a knife, dagger or spear-head. Length, 75 mm. ; maximum width, 36 mm -Shears (fig. 5, nos. 376, 478 and 479) Seven pairs of shears or parts thereof were found on the site, and all are of a form common on Irish and continental sites from the later part of the Iron Age to mediaeval times 21. PERIOD I Two fragmentary examples have come from the lower level and both were of small size. One blade and part of the attached shank of no. 76 (fig. 5) survive. The blade length is only 33 mm. and maximum width is 11 mm. The second lower-level shears (no. 511, not illustrated) is broken at three points but is other wise reasonably complete. Its total length is 90 mm. PERIOD II Four pairs from the upper level are complete, though heavily rusted; part of the bow-end of a fifth has also survived. Four of them have the expanding form of spring bow, but the shanks of the fifth (fig. 5, no. 376) do not expand before curving around to the bow. Lengths vary from 110 mm. to 214 mm. Awls (fig. 6, nos. 170, 523, 550, 556, 565, 569 and 569a) Nine objects which appear to have been awls were found, all of them from different places within the ring-fort. Three, 170, 523 and 565, are from the lower level, the other six from the upper. Careful cleaning has enabled us to determine that in each case about one-half of the length has a circular section tapering to a point and the other half has an angular section also tapering. The ^objects are, therefore, thickest at the centre where the round and angular portions run into one another. The overall lengths vary from 71 mm. to 125 mm. No trace of a handle survives, though it is likely that for convenience of use all of them would have been fitted with bone, antler,22 or wooden hafts. Because of the marked rectangularity of the sections of the angular portions of nos. 565, 569 and 523, it is possible to argue that these are narrow chisels rather than awls 21 See Hencken: P.R.I.A., LUI, C (1950), 112 and fig. 45, and " Cahercommaun," Extra Vol. R.S.A.I., for 1938 and ?

Garryduff I?Various iron objects</page><page sequence="30">46 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy and the matter cannot be firmly determined since it cannot be said with any certainty which end was hafted. The balance of probability is, however, in favour of the awl interpr?tation. v One of the Period II awls (569a) is the best-preserved and is also the smallest. The tang is of oblong section and near the centre this runs into a section which remains oblong but now has rounded corners, the section becoming smaller for part of the way towards the working end and then spreading once more into a flat spatulate drilling element. This form is very close to certain drill-bits used in fine work at the present day. Iron awls have come from several Irish sites including Carraig Aille,23 Cah?r commaun,24 Lagore,25 Ballinderry II.26 Chisels (fig. 7, nos. 48 and 186) Two chisels were found, both in. the upper habitation level and they therer fore belong to Period II. No. 48 is a socketed large chisel measuring 150 mm. overall, its blade having a maximum width of 15 mm. The diameter at the mouth of the socket is 20 mm,^ This is similar to an old find from Lagore,27 but even more closely resembles an example from Carraig Aille.28 The second (no. 186) is tanged and much smaller. Overall length, 93 mm.; blade length, 47 mm. ; maximum width of blade, 17 mm. ; thickness of blade, 4 mm. The tang has a rectangular section. Saws (fig. 5, nos. 493 and 494) These saws were found in the upper level of occupation, one in the north-west of the enclosure, the other in the south-east; both belong to Period II. Neither example is complete but enough survives in each case to indicate the^riginal form. In- no. 493 one end of the blade and the mounting shank are gone, but th? other end of the blade and shank are complete. It is clear that the blade and shank were all of one piece, that is, the blade was not detachable as in the modern hack-saw. The upper end of the shank widens to a roundel through a hole in the centre of which a short nail was passed. This entered the end of what may be assumed to have been a wooden handle set parallel to the blade. In effect the instrument became a bow saw like the modern hack-saw though, of course, the blade was not under tension as it is in the modern version of the tool. There are seven teeth per 2 cm. of length and they run right to the end under the shank. Present maximum depth of the blade is 12 mm/and present thickness is 1-5; mm. and this is thinner due to rusting and scaling than it was originally. 28 ??Uord?in: P.R.?.A., LU, C (1949), pp. 81 and 98, figs. 11, nos. 456, 460 and fig. 21, nos. 137 and 139. 24 Hencken: R.S.A .1., Extra Volume for 1938, p. 48, fig. 29, no. 512. 25 Hencken: P.R.I.A., LIII, C (1950), 110 and fig. 42, nos. 239 and 1646. 2?

Cork 47 Where the teeth are well preserved the depth of the trough between a pair of points is 3 mm. so that, in general, the saw would have given a rather coarse cut. There is no evidence to show that alternate teeth were set to left and right (to open the cut) as in the modern saw. In no. 494 the whole of the blade is present, but of the mounting shanks only the stumps remain. The method of mounting on a handle parallel to the blade must have been the same as in no. 493. The length of the cutting edge is 105 mm. and again the blade and shanks are all of one piece. Accumulated rust makes it difficult to assess the thickness of the blade, but it can hardly have been less than 5 mm., while the depth is 21 mm. In this saw there are six teeth per 2 cm. and thus* it is somewhat coarser than no. 493. Saws of a similar form are known from Carraig Aille I and II.29 Lagore has produced two saws of a different style, if indeed they are saws at all, and there are two small saws amongst the old finds, but the evidence that they are from Lagore is inconclusive.30 Dividers or Calipers (?) (fig. 4, nos. 7? 95 and 581) These three objects have come from the upper level, two from the south-east quadrant of the interior and one from the north-west. All belong to Period II. They are somewhat enigmatic and their identification as &lt;? dividers " or " cali pers " can be regarded as no more than a suggestion. A very similar object is recorded from Cahercommaun, Co. Clare,31 and is treated in the report as a knife, but the statement in the text does not agree with what can be understood from the drawing. The text says that the object " had a short wide tang with a rivet hole/' while the drawing gives a section of this " tang " and shows it tapering to a knife edge. Another example is known from the ring-fort at Oldcourt, Skibbereen, excavated by the late Conchubhar ? Cuilean?in.32 The three examples from Garryduff are clearly not knives, and on this ground the Cahercommaun and Oldcourt objects are unlikely to be knives of any ordinary form. The objects consist of a flat portion.at one end of which there is a hole and at the other a tapering tang-like projection (fig. 4, nos. 7, 95 and 581). The flat parts do not seem to be knife blades for they do not taper to cutting edges. It is possible that if two of them were put together by means of a rivet through the holes, the ' tangs " would then become the points of a (&lt; caliper " or " divider " for scribing circles. We know that such instruments were used at Garryduff for some of the stone trial-pieces bear circles scribed in this way (see below). Against this it may be said that when the points were closed in they would lie side by side and not in apposition as they do in the modern caliper. Because of this they would not be suitable for scribing very small circles. No. 95 29 ? R?ord?in: P.R.I.A., LU, C (1949), 79 and 98, and figs. 11, no. 34; 21, no. 148.

Cork 49 is the best-preserved of the three?the others have suffered heavily from cor rosion?and measures 9-5 cm. overall. The " tang " is 3-5 cm. long. The flat portion measures 1-5 cm. wide by almost 4 mm. thick and the diameter of the hole is 4 mm. Nos. 7 and 581 are very similar in size and corm. On the other hand, if a pair of them were riveted together in the manner suggested and if the " tangs " were fitted with handles, they could perhaps be used as shears for cutting small pieces of sheet metal, but unless the handles were of small diameter in section, they would foul one another and prevent the blades from working to the full length of the cut. Alternatively, if a single example were fixed to the edge of a piece of hard wood, the objects might have been used in the manner of the small modern paper-trimming guillotine. For either of these uses the blade would not taper to a knife-edge but would have a flat working edge as in a scissors or shears. A fourth example (fig. 4, no. 95a) from the upper level of habitation refuse in the south-west quadrant, and therefore also belonging to Period II, is appreci ably larger in its tang which had a length of 15 cm. and a sectional diameter of 1 cm., but the blade portion is only slightly larger than that of no. 581. Though heavily corroded the stub of a rivet is recognizable in the hole at its end and the opposite end of the blade narrows and neatly rounds off into the circular sectioned tang. Overall length of blade, 6-5 cm. ; average width, 1-7 cm. ; thick ness, 5 mm. at back edge, 3 mm. at " cutting " edge. The end of the tang has been corroded away and there is no evidence that the tang had been thrust into a haft made of wood, bone or other material. Socketed pronged tools (fig. 5, nos. 322 and 509) Ten examples of this type of tool were found, only one (no. 509, fig. 5) of which came from the lower level (Period I). The rest are from the upper level of occupation and therefore belong to Period II. No. 322 (fig. 5) came from the collapse of the outer face of the bank at the north side of the entrance while another (no. 293, not illustrated) came from the upper level of the refuse in the ditch at the same place. The rest are from all quadrants within the enclosure. The tools consist of a flat spade-shaped blade which, instead of a cutting edge, is provided with three short pointed teeth. The upper end of the blade narrows and above this narrowing two flanges or wings are turned inward to form an open socket to take a wooden haft. Though all are small, the sizes vary from 7 cm. long (no. 322) to 4 cm. (no. 150). Maximum blade widths also vary very much, as do the socket sizes. Well-preserved teeth are 5 mm. long. The two which are illustrated are the best-preserved of the Garryduff group, and though the others have suffered in varying degrees from corrosion, all of them are clearly identifiable. Nos. 193 and 193a (not illustrated) consist in each case of two of the tools of identical shape and size put together by forcing the wing-flange of one socket into the opening of the socket of the second so that the blade portions and the points on their edges, make an approximate register with one another. An exactly similar case is known from another Irish site, the D</page><page sequence="34">5o Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy " Spectacles," at Lough Gur, Co. Limerick.33 Why they should have been put together in this way is not easily explainable since we do not know what the tools were used for at all. Various suggestions have been made and these have been recently discussed briefly by Piggott34 who gives references to all the other known Irish, Scottish and continental examples. Piggot points out that the objects seem to fall into two groups, one group belonging to the Roman period, the other belonging to the post-Roman dark ages. The Irish examples are all from the Early Christian period, as are also the Scottish parallels. A new group of six bronze " combs " from a late Roman site at Chalton, Hants., England, has been published by Mr. S. S. Fr?re, F.S.A.35 The objects are made from flat pieces of bronze and have no sockets, but they are provided with the same kind of small teeth -as in the socketed iron"objects from Ireland and elsewhere. In these late Roman objects the number of teeth varies from five to seven and Mr. Frere reiterates the view that the tools are unlikely to have been used in weaving. ' Because there were six together at Chalton, the suggestion i? made that they belong to some sort of multiple tool, and since they came from a lynchet on an agricultural site, " wool combing or carpentry rather than pottery decoration or the marbling of paint or scoring of tiles or plaster suggests itself. "36 Ring-pins (fig. 8, nos. 61, 85, 166, 173, 357, 477, 480, 495, 496). Nine complete, or almost complete, ring-pins were found, all except one (no. 480) being from the upper level or Period II. They have come from all parts of the enclosure as well as from the rubbish in the ditch at the north side of the entrance. The state of preservation varies very much, but as can Be seen from the illustrations, several were well preserved enough to leave do doubt not only as regards identity of the objects themselves but also to make clear the nature of the ring structure/which, as can be seen in nos. 495/496 and 480, was of key-ring form. In the main these iron ring-pins are smaller than the bronze examples from the site, though no. 173 has a long shank and the ring of no. 495 is large. Note the very small ring in no. 357. It is not possible to say whether any of the rings had the milled decoration which is to be seen on some of the bronze pins since corrosion has affected the,surfaces so much. Overall lengths vary from 6-5 cm. to 12*5 cm. and ring diameter from 1 cm. to 2-5 cm. Iron ring-pins similar in general character have corne from Carraig Aille, Lough Gur,37 and from Cahercommaun, Co. Clare.38. Six straight pins which, though heavily corroded (fig. 8, nos. 47, 47a and 168), can be seen to have loop-heads, may be the shanks of ring-pins from which the rings have disappeared. All six are from Period II. 33 ? R?ord?in: P.R.I.A., LU, C (1949), 103, and fig. 22, no. 1. 34 Piggott: P.S.A.S., LXXXVII (1952-53), 193.

This is heavily corroded, but seems to have consisted of .a flat disc from the centre, of the back of which there protruded a straight pin bent at. right angles (sunflower pin fashion). Only the stub of the shank remains and gives a slight indication of the right-angle bend. It is pos?ible( however, that the object was merely a large circular-headed nail which became bent in use. Diameter of disc, 3 cm. , No. 525 is a pm of similar form and there is no doubt of its identity as such despite corrosion. Its disc head is small, being only 1 cm. in diameter and the surviving portion of the shank is 6 cm. long and of circular section. A pin of very similar form but slightly larger and in bronze is known from Garranes, Co. Cork.39 Five other pins, one from Period I (no. 299) and four from Period II (nos. 2?5, 314, 315 and 521) are all similar to one another., They have straight shanks and the tops are bent over to form a sort of solid circular flat which overhangs the' shank. Three almost exactly similar pins are known from Carraig Aille, Co. Limerick.40 " Bifid Pins " (fig. 8, nos. 583, 591) Four of these objects were found, three in the western half of the enclosure and one in the refuse in the ditch at the north side of the entrance. Two belong to the upper level or Period II and two to the lower level or Period I. The best-preserved specimen, which comes from Period I, is no. 583 (fig. 8) and in this the general features of the type can be tolerably well seen. The straight shank appears to have had a rectangular section which t?pers down to a flat point. The upper, end of the shank is cloven into two rectangular-sectioned arms which splay outward a little from one another. The ends of these arms are rolled over outward to give the solid cylindrical ^ knobs " which give a finish to the object at the top. Overall length-is 10 cm. No. 591 is from Period ?I, and though less well preserved, can be seen to be similar, except that the tops of the arms are vo\\o?4nward. The arms forming the bifid portion are shorter than in iio. 583, but the sliank appears to have had a rectangular section, as in that instance. The two other examples, nos. 133 and 558 (not illustrated) are poorly preserved but are more like 591 than 583, as the bifid portions are also short. Due to the amount of corrosion it is impossible to say whether the tops of the arms are rolled inward or outward. The National Museum has a comparable pin to these but it is in bronze and comes from the shore of Lakefield Lake, Co. Cavan, not far from a crannog. The suggested date is Early Christian period.41 The National Museum also has an iron example from Mr. P. J. Hartnett's excavation at Feltrim Hill. This is &gt; very similar to the Garryduff pins. ?

They came from all quadrants of the interior and from the rubbish in the ditch at the north side of the entrance. Except for some variation in size (lengths, 8-5 to 11*8 cm.), all are very similar to one another and all should be compared with the bronze example described above /fig. 2, no.,58). All consist of a straight flat bar of iron widening towards the foot, which is bent over at a-right angle and contains what originally was a square or rectangujar hole. When' the foot was pressed into the barrel of the lock, this hole closed the springs together, permitting the two parts of the lock to be drawn apart.

It is described in the text as an " iron handle " but its form and size suggest that it is an iron key of the Garryduff type. The absence of the necessary perforated foot can be due to corrosion.

Cork 55 area and may therefore have been used on the door of one of the houses. It is, very heavily rusted, so much so that little could be done to preserve it. This being so and, since the details of its parts could not be seen because of the rust, it was thought well to dissect it. Examination in this way gave quite a clear picture of its structure, even though the internal features of the barrel were very oxidized. The barrel and bow (fig. 9) which together form a U-shape, had been made from a single piece of metal, which, to begin with, consisted of a rectangle of iron with a narrow strip projecting from the centre of one short side. The rectangle was then bent round to form a tube or barrel, the line where the edges met being clearly distinguishable. The internal diameter of the tube thus formed was 1-2 cm. The projecting strip was next bent so as to give barrel and strip together a U-form. A disc of iron (1-2 cm. in diameter) with a rectangular hole in its centre was fitted into one end of the barrel (at A, fig. 9) and the other (that at the round base of the U) was left open (B, fig. 9). The second part of the lock consisted of a disc of iron, 1-7 cm. in diameter (C, fig. 9), to the centre of which the end of a bar of rectangular section, D, was fitted. The length of this bar was shorter than the length of the barrel of the lock. Two iron spring strips (E and F) were welded to the free end of the bar so that the springs spread out, one on each side of the bar as shown. An arm, G, arising out of the edge of disc C was provided with a slot perforation, H, which slipped over the end of the bow when the two parts of the object were put together in the locked position as in the lower diagram. To open the lock the key J was inserted into the open end of the barrel (lower diagram) and as it was pressed inward, the hole in its foot passed over the springs closing them together sufficiently to allow them to pass out through the hole in disc A (upper diagram), thus permitting the two parts of the lock to be drawn completely apart. A very similar lock was found at Cahercommaun, Co. Clare43 and there are springs and keys for such locks from Lagore.44 Wood-Martin45 illustrates an object which is said to have come from Lag;ore and which appears to be another complete lock. The barrel in this instance is square-sectioned. The type appears to be of Roman origin but continued to be used until perhaps late mediaeval times. In the National Museum, Dublin, there is an iron fetter dredged from the mud at the point of confluence of the River Black with the River Barrow in the townland of Oldgrange, Co. Kildare. The fetter was provided with a barrel lock similar to those dealt with here and the suggested date is " Early Iron Age, probably sub-Roman. ' '46 ?Hencken: R.S.

There can be no doubt that it is the^type of small anvil which would have been usedA)y a craftsman for fine work. It came from the uppermost layer of habitation refuse which lay upon the final collapse of the bank and therefore it belongs to Period II. It is made from a solid block of iron of square section measuring 3 cm. by 3 cm. at the'top or working ^surface, tapering slightly downward to 2-5 cm. by 2-5 cm. at the base. From the centre of the base a tapering spike projects, also of more or less square section. This would have been driven into a wooden block Fig. 10.

The height of the body of the anvil is 7-8 cm. From the centre of one face of the body a conical boss projects. This is placed near the top of the anvil and is to be compared with the similar but much larger and longer conical protrusion found at one end' of the present-day black smith's anvil. Total projection of the boss is 2 cm. The working surface of the top of the anvil may have been quite flat origin ally but due to use it has become slightly convex, the edges being lower than the centre. Also the hammering on this upper surface has caused the metal to spread somewhat at the edges.</page><page sequence="41">O'Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 57 No parallel in iron is known to me in the Irish material, though there are the small bronze anvils which would have been used in the same manner as the Garryduff example by craftsmen doing fine work. These, however, seem to be of late Bronze Age date as, for instance, the anvil in the Bishopsland, Co. Kildare, hoard.47 Ladles (fig. 10, nos. 481, 482) Two of these objects were found, both within the enclosure. No. 481 came from the upper level of occupation in the south-east quadrant and overlay the collapse of the inner face of the bank. It belongs, therefore, to Period II. No. 482 was found in the north-west quadrant at the bottom of the primary occupation layer and belongs to Period I. The two ladles are very similar to one another, the only differences being the disc termination of the handle of no. 482 which is not found in no. 481, and the slightly larger diameter of the bowl of no. 482. The larger ladle has an overall length of 18 cm. while the smaller is 17 cm. The handles are approximately the same lengths in both, but the bowl of no. 482 has a maximum diameter of 9-4 cm. while the same dimension in no. 481 is 8 cm. Maximum depth of the bowl in each case is slightly over 1 cm. Parallels come from Ballinderry II Crannog where two examples were found in the Early Christian stratum.48 Hencken originally suggested that this stratum was perhaps begun in the seventh century and that it may have con tinued through the eighth and into the ninth,49 but in his more recent discussion of it he gives its central period as 550-650 A.D.50 Other similar ladles have come from the crannogs around Strokestown, Co. Roscommon and are in the National Museum, Dublin, and Wood-Martin51 figures two said to have come from the Lagore crannog. Hencken52 figures from Lagore an object which he calls " a small iron dish," and which is 84 cm. in diameter; its general appearance suggests that it is another ladle with its handle missing. This example comes from his Period lb, the first occupation of the site, which he dates to the seventh century. Sickles (fig. 7, nos. 47b, 47c) Two of these objects were found, one (no. 47c) by the landowner in the course of his exploratory digging and one (47b) by us during the course of our excavation.

Its length measured (in a straight line) from the tip of its blade to the end of the tang is 13 cm.; maximum width of blade, 2-5 cm.; thickness, 7 mm. Of no. 47b about half of the blade survives and this is heavily corroded. Judging from its curvature this example seems to have been slightly smaller, but one cannot be certain of this because of its corroded state. Amongsit Irish sites from which similar sickles have come are Ring-fort 2 at Cush, Co. Limerick,53 and Church Island, near Valencia; Co. Kerry.54 The latter occurred at an indeterminate point in the stratification and may have belonged to the Early Christian stratum or to the time between the end of the primary monastic period and the beginning of the late mediaeval (secondary) occupation. The example from Cush was, however, much earlier (Early Jron Age at latest) in the opinion of the excavator of that site. It is a type of agricultural implement which had a long life in this small size. A larger and more curved sickle is known from Leacanabuaile, Co. Kerry.55 Bill-hooks or Slashers (fig. 10, no. 102) One of these objects was found, as well as a fragment of what may have been a second, but the latter is too corroded to be certain pf the identification. Both came from the upper level of occupation in the south-west quadrant of the interior. ,,/ v No. 102 was a large implement since it's present length is 22-7 cm. despite the fact that the top of its blade is missing. The3urviving part of the blade is 9 cm. long, 5-5 cm. wide and is 1*5 cm. thick on the back edge. The socket for the haft is of the open type being formed of flanges forged up from each edge of the stub of the blade. It would take a haft 4 cm. in maximum thickness. Similar, though better preserved, bill-hooks have been found at Lagore56 and at Ballin derry I.57 The former was unstratified, but Hencken considers that it is of the usual Early Christian type which he suggests has a La T?ne-Roman origin. The Ballinderry example was found below the floor of House I and should belong: to the earliest phase of that site.

Garryduff I?Various iron objects The plate is made from a strip of iron slipped through an iron ring of rectangular outline, the ends of the strip being then bent towards each other into full register and cut to a triangular outline with rounded apex. The tongue of the buckle passed through a hole in the strip at the fold. The material of the strap to which the buckle was affixed was placed between the ends of the strip and was held in place by a stud with hemispherical head, the shank of which passed through the tail of the buckle to be held at the other side by an iron ring which (as a straight piece of wire) had been pushed through a hole in the end of the shank of the stud. This form of fixture is still used to-day for the buttons of linen overall coats. The maximum dimensions of the buckle are : length, 54 cm. ; width, 3 cm. The National Mus?um, Dublin, has acquired a bronze buckle,</page><page sequence="44">6o Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy highly decorated with enamel and amber, which has come from Rathtinaun towniand on the foreshore of Lough Gara, Co.

Donegal.60 Toilet Implement (?) (?g. 11, no. 594) This object was found in the lower part of the, refuse in the ditch at the north side of the entrance to the ring-fort, a, stratigraphical position which suggests that it belongs to an early period of the occupation, though it cannot be said with certainty to belong to the primary period., It consists of a shank, square in section, which ^is flattened at one end to form a small spatulate blade of triangular form set askew with respect to the axis of the shank. The other end now has a swelling accretion of rust which suggests that there was here a suspension loop or loose ring. Little cleaning could be done because of the severely corroded condition of the object, but removal of some of the scale from the blade shows that this probably had a sharp cutting edge on" its curved side. This may mean that the object should be treated as a surgical instrument or craftsman's tool. Overall lengpti^S'6 cm.; section of shank, 5 by 5 mm.; maximum width oiblade, 1 cm.; length of blade, 2 cm. ? R?ord?in61 has adverted to the difficulty of distinguishing between surgical and toilet implements of the kind here dealt with. They are well known in Roman contexts and it is reasonable to suppose that the Irish examples are ultimately derived therefrom. Tanged Object {?g. 7, no. 379) This object was found just under the turf in the top of the secondary habitation layer and hence belongs at the earliest to Period II; because of its position, however, allowance must be made for the possibility that it belongs to a later time and that it has sunk through the turf. It consists of a tapering tang of square section which arises out of a disc; below the disc the section is circular and this part of the object tapers to a point. The disc may have been a separate piece pushed into place over the tang to act as a stop for the haft, but one cannot be certain of this even though the accretion of rust has been cleared off. The presence of the stop-disc suggests that the head of the haft was meant to be hammered upon to enable the implement to be used as some sort of punch, but it is also possible to suggest that it was some,sort of \ 68 See J.R.S.A.I., XC (1960), 37 and fig. 30, p. 38 and L. de Paor in'Bericht ?ber den V.

Staples (fig. 7, nos. 515, 606) Two of these objects were found, one in the north-east quadrant of the interior, the other in the north-west and both come from the upper habitation layer and belong to Period II. They are similar in size and shape, but no. 606 is well preserved while no. 515 is very heavily rusted. The back of the latter is 7-5 cm. long, 1-2 cm. wide and the internal lengths of its shanks are 2*7 cm. The back of no. 606 is 6-3 cm. long, 1 cm. wide and its shanks arc 2-8 cm. long internally. Two Iron Objects (fig. 7, nos. 297, 381) ^ These objects are closely similar to each other but of the two, no, 297 is the better preserved. This latter came from the ditch at the north side of the entrance at a de]5th which suggests that it probably belongs to Period II of the site. No. 381, however, was found below a hearth in the north-west quadrant of the interior and may belong to Period I. The objects consist of a thin bar, straight along one edge but swelling out at the centre of the opposite edge. It is difficult to suggest a use for these objects. It may be that they were the beams of small balances or weighing scales, the pans being suspended from the end loops. The broad part of the beam, however, shows no hole, a feature which would be necessary for the suspension of a weighing scales. Furthermore, the rolled-over ends show little evidence of holes or loops for the suspension of scale-pans. We have not been able to find parallels for them in the published Irish material. Lengths, 8 cm. and 8-8 cm.; maximum widths, 1*8 cm. and 1*2 cm. ; thicknesses, 5 mm. Steelyard (?) (fig. 7, no. 190) This object was found in the north-east quadrant of the interior of the fort at the base of the upper habit ationlevel and belongs to the beginning of Period II. It is incomplete and heavily corroded so that its identification as a steelyard is no more than a tentative suggestion. The form of the object will best be under stood from the drawing. It is clear that at the " beak " end there was originally a hole, and from a hook in this the object to be weighed could be suspended. A hole, now closed up with rust, existed near the top of the upward projection. A ring or hook in this hole would have enabled the yard to be suspended when in use and the long tapering shank would have carried the movable weights. The end of the shank is missing. Overall length, 214 cm. ; maximum width, 3-8 cm.; thickness, 5 mm. What appears to be a very similar object came from the ring-fort at Carrigmurish, Co.

The Period I hook (no. 291) which came from the old turf in the north-east quadrant, has a rather open curve and when in use its tang was driven into a haft of some kind. Length, measured on the curve, 7 cm. ; diameter of section, 5 mm. (not illustrated). Nos. 187 (not illustrated) and 228 (fig. 7) from Period II, are of the same type, though 228 is much larger. Its square-sectioned tang is clearly recognizable and it is the largest of the hooks. It is gaff-like in appearance. Overall length, 14-5 cm. Nos. 175 and 597 are similar in size and form to each other, though no. 175 is incomplete at its tang end. No. 597 was a suspension hook as the upper end of its shank was rolled-over to form a loop. The shank had a circular cross-section, but the hook portion was rectangular. Length of shank^J^S cm. No. 175 has a rectangular section throughout. No. 576 (not illustrated) is very poorly preserved but, though thicker and heavier, seems to have been similar in form to nos. 175 and 597. Rings (fig. 7, nos. 52, 167, 305, 517, 519, 216, 524) Seven rings of various sizes were found, two from Period I (nos. 216, 524) and five from Period II. They have come, principally from the post-hole area within the enclosure and from the ditch, at the north side of the entrance. All are circular except no. 52 which is rectangular^ measuring 5-3 cm. by 5 cm. The circular rings vary in overall diameter from 2 cm. to 4*3 cm. Corrosion in every instance is severe so that sectional diameters do not mean much ; however, these vary from 4 mm. (no. 167) to 1 cm. (517). None of the rings are of the types found in the Garryduff iron ring-pins except for no. 167, which is small enough to have been used in this way. This, however, is a continuous ring and is not of the spiral " key-ring " form identifiable in several of the Garryduff pins. y Rings of this type have been found on several Irish sites as, for instance, Carraig Aille63 at Lough Gur, Ballycatteen,64 Co. Cork, and Cahercomma?n,65 Co. Clare. Tenet (?) (fig. 11, no. 47d) This object was found in the southern part of the south-west quadrant on the paved area and therefore belongs to Period II. It consists of a ring (now incomplete) mounted on a shank which displays a slight curve. Immediately below the ring the shank has a circular section but this very quickly flattens and spreads to a spatulate form. Though severely corroded, it appears to have had a 63 ?

Washers (fig. 11, nos. 562, 303) No. 562, a small iron washer, was found on the pavement in the southern part of House II and therefore seems to belong to Period I. Its average overall diameter is' 1-8 cm.; diameter of centre hole, 4 mm.; thickness, 2 mm. No. 303 was found near the bottom of the refuse in the ditch at the north side of the entrance and may, therefore, belong to Period I also. It is a roughly rectangular flat piece of iron with a central circular perforation. The rectangle is 2*3 cm. by 2*5 cm. and the thickness is about 2 mm. The central perforation is 4 mm. in diameter. Vessel " Escutcheons " (fig. ll,*nos. 178, 366, 510, 561, 575) Five of these objects were found, four in the interior of the fort and one in the ditch at the north side of the entrance. All are from the upper level of habitation and hence belong to Period II. Nos. 178, 366, 510 and 561 are similar to one another in size and form and are made from strips of iron the ends of which are bent around into full register. The loop thus formed is forged to a circular cross-section. The tab ends were closed over the material of the objects to which they were attached and a single rivet was put through to hold the whole together tightly. No. 561, though heavily covered with an accretion of rust, can be seen to have three links of a chain attached to its loop. The links may have been of figure-of-eight form. No. 575 differs from the others in that it was not made from a strip bent over on itself. Its single-thickness tab had its narrowed upper end bent over to form a small loop. The tab was held in place on the object by means of a single rivet. In calling these objects " vessel escutcheons " the possibility that they were attached to strap-ends or other objects, is not excluded. Maximum dimensions vary from 3 cm. to 3-5 cm. Loops (?) (fig. 7, nos. 28, 380) Three of these objects came from the interior of the fort, two from the post-hole area of House I, the third from the refuse running on to the bank at the north side. All are, from Period II. The objects are similar in size and form and consist of a straight shank on one end of which an " eye " is formed by bending the metal around on itself. The shanks are incomplete at the opposite ends so that it is not possible to say for what purpose the objects were made. Present overall lengths vary from 4 cm. to 8*5 cm. and the eye diameters vary between 5 mm. and 1 cm. Ferrules (fig. 11, nos. ?50, 295, 296, 340, 552) Four of these objects (295, 296, 340, 552) were found, two in the northern half of the interior of the fort and two very deep in the rubbish in the ditch at</page><page sequence="48">64 Proceedings ?f the Royal Irish Academy the north side of the entrance. Those from the interior came from the bottom of the lower layer of habitation refuse. All four are, therefore, from Period I. A larger ferrule, no. 150, came from the south-west quadrant of the interior from a point on the south of House I. This ferrule tapers from the open to the rounded closed end and is of the type which might have been used on the. butt' of a spear shaft. It is 5 cm. long and has a diameter of 1-8 cm. Nos. 295, 340 arid 552 are thimble-like in form arid vary slightly in size, no. 295 being the smallest (3 cm. long, maximum diameter, 1 cm.) and 340 being the largest (3*5 cm. long, maximum diameter, 1-7 cm.). No. 296 has both ends open. Length 2.cm.; overall diameter, 1-7 cm. Iron Object (fig. Tl, no. 582) This object was found at the bottom of the lower layer of habitation refuse in the north-west quadrant and therefore belongs' to Period I. It consists of an oval-spatulate " foot," convex on the upper surface and flat on the underside. From one end a slender tang projects upward at an outward-sloping angle. The tang has a circular cross-section and is incomplete at its upper end. The length of the " foot " is 3-8 cm.; width, 1*4 cm.; thickness, 6 mm. Diameter of section of tang, 4 mm. It is difficult to say how this object was used. One could imagine it being used like a small trowel for smoothing some soft material such as clay or sand. A tool like this, called a " slicker," was used in quite recent times by a group of travelling smiths in east Cork for smoothing sand moulds preparatory to casting small iron objects.at their primitive foundries. Iron Mount (fig. 11, no. 600) This object was found in the upper habitation layer where this had run on to the bank in the southern part of the south-east quadrant. It belongs to Period II. In its present incomplete state it has, a sort of hook-like outline but this is deceptive. It is made from a thin strip of kon and was held in place flat against something probably made of wood for the stubs of two nailsrremain in position in the strip. Width, 1-4 cm.; thickness, 2 mm. Hinge (?) (fig. 11, no. 21) This was found in the lowest layer of habitation refuse within the southern end of House II and belongs to Period I. It consists of a flat strip from one end of which a pivot-like shank arises. The stub of a nail remains in position at the other end of the strip. The object is heavily corroded and this adds to the difficulty of identification. The suggestion that it is part of a pivot hinge is, therefore, very tentative. Length of pivot shank, 5 cm. ; length of strip, 4-5 cm. ; length of surviving portion of nail, 1 cm. , Hammer (?) (fig. 11,; no. 523a) This little object was found with the iron awl no., 523 (fig/ 6) in the lower layer of habitation refuse in the south-west quadrant of the interior of the fort. It belongs to Period I. It consists of a tubular ring from the periphery of which</page><page sequence="49">O'Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 65 a rectangular-sectioned tapering projection arises. The suggestion that it is a very small hammer is made because the end of the projection is burred and spread as if from hammering. The identification is, of course, tentative, but, if correct, the tubular ring would become the socket for a light haft. Such a hammer might be used in fine metalwork. Length of tubular socket, 9 mm.; internal diameter of socket, 1 cm.; overall length of projection, 3*2 cm. 1 I have not been able to find a close parallel in the published material, unless an object from Garranes, Co. Cork,66 can be regarded as one. This, too, appears to have a small tubular ring-socket with a projection from the periphery but it is so corroded as to make any ^identification very uncertain. Nails Twenty-four objects that can be identified as nails were found in all parts of the site.v Four of them came from Period I and the remainder from Period II. As all of them are heavily corroded and none displays any feature of particular interest, they have not been illustrated. In size they vary from very small tacks such as no. 526 (overall length, 15 mm., diameter of head, 5 mm.) to fairly large examples such as no. 498 (overall length, 6*7 cm. ; diameter of head, 2 cm.). They compare closely with the nails found on most of the excavated Irish sites of the period. Wire Eight fragments of wire were found, all in the upper level and in various parts of the interior of the fort and in the ditch on the north side of the entrance. They are all of circular section but vary in thickness from 2 mm. to 1 cm. All are short lengths and none shows any special features. Unidentifiable Objects In addition to the" iron objects described there are twenty other pieces so corroded that no identifications could be made. BONE OBJECTS Nine bone objects were found, five from the lower level or Period I and four from the upper or PeriodTI. They are comparatively well preserved and, there fore, the absence of greater numbers of objects in this material cannot altogether be attributed to acid soil conditions. Period I Objects (?g. 12, nos, 105, 106, 154, 155, 159) All of these were found within a single 9' square area (Square 5) in the south-west quadrant and well to the south of the House I area and unquestion ably in the lower layer of habitation refuse. They were not found together nor at the 'same depths in the layer, so they are not to be regarded as a single find. 66 ? R?ord?in: P.RJ.A.; XLVII, C (1942), fig. 9, no. 239. E</page><page sequence="50">66 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy The two items of most interest in this group are nos. 105 and 159. No. 105, now incomplete, is an object consisting of a flat " waisted " head from one edge of which a slightly tapering shank arises. The present end of the shank is an obvious fracture and it is impossible to say what its original length may have been. If it had a long one tapering to a point, the object can have been a pin with; decorative head; on the other hand, if the shank had been short, the form might then suggest a peg from a stringed musical instrument, since the flat head provides a good grip for the fingers. It is questionable, however, if such a slender shank in bone would have had strength enough to take the strain of a string..

Cork 67 of the head which have not been polished out, convey the same impression. The most noteworthy feature is the swelling which occurs in the shank one-third of the way down from the head. This is to be seen in several of the bronze pins from Garryduff (cf. fig. 2, nos. 360, 375, 491, 489, 483) and in at least five of the bone pins and one bronze pin from Lagore,70 as well as two in bone and one in wood from Ballinderry II.71 It does not occur in the large range of bone pins from Cahercommaun and Carraig Aille. Stevenson72 has discussed the feature in pins from Scotland and England and has suggested that it may have a late Roman or fifth-century origin though it continues into the seventh century in Scotland. The swelling may have helped to keep the pin in place when thrust into the clothing.

Nos. 154 and 155 are thin, narrow slips pointed at one end and left rough at the other. Period II Objects (fig. 12, nos. 122, 286) No. 122, a spindle whorl, was found just inside the southern bank not far from the area occupied by the Period II paved floor and stone-lined hearth. It may have been associated with the activity around these features. The whorl is decorated on one face only with incised concentric circles and with a ring of dot-and-circle markings around the central hole. The latter is almost a cylindrical boring, but it has been enlarged and made somewhat irregular by wear caused by the rubbing of a string which passed through the hole. The rubbing has worn several grooves in the bone. Overall diameter, 4 cm. ; average diameter of central hole, 1-3 cm.; thickness, 1-3 cm. Whorls of this type are common on Irish sites of the period, similar examples having been found at Carraig Aille,73 Cahercommaun,74 Ballinderry II75 and Lagore.76 One example from the latter site has a very similar ornamentation. No. 286, found in the upper habitation layer where it began to run over the bank facing in the north-east quadrant, appears to be part of a hook the point of which has broken off. It is very carefully made and is highly polished through out. Its form will best be understood from the illustration (fig. 12).

GLASS OBJECTS Counting whole and fragmentary objects in this material, there are about fifty items from the site. The majority are beads of one form or another and they have come from all parts of the enclosure, as well as from the ditch at the north side of the entrance. As with finds in other materials, the greater number of glass objects is from the upper level of occupation or Period II, while only a small number are attributable to the primary level of habitation refuse which represents Period L PERIOD I Glass from Vessels There are four fragments of glass (not illustrated) which are parts of vessels as is shown by the curvature. Two fragments were found near to each other in the south-west quadrant andj ust above old ground level. Their thicknesses vary from 1 mm. to about 1*75 m. and their maximum dimensions are 34 cm. and 1*1 cm. respectively. The larger piece (no. 164) is of clear glass with a greenish yellow tint and there are many small included bubbles. Mr. Raleigh Radford, on seeing it, thought it superficially similar to fragments of Egyptian glass found by him at Tintagel, Cornwall,77 and while Mr. D. B. Harden78 (who has not seen the fragment) would allow that it could have come from that source, thinks from the description of it that it may be a normal western dark-age piece. The smaller piece (no. 152) is a better quality of glass in that there are no included bubbles. It is quite un weathered and transparent but has a stronger tint tending towards a light amber colour. w Dark Age Britain (London, 1956), p. 64. 78 ibid., p. 151.</page><page sequence="53">O'Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co.

No. 358 is a quite unweathered fragment, 1-5 cm. in maximum dimension and slightly less than 1 mm. thick. It is a transparent glass but there are many minute included bubbles and there is a very slight bluish-green tint. No. 609, a triangular fragment of maximum dimension 3-1 cm. and slightly less than 2 mm. in thickness, displays a type of weathering on the faces whiph suggests that the piece has been beated or slightly burnt in a fire. The edges are clean and unweathered but the arrises are not sharp?the sharpness appears to have been killed by heating. While the glass was hot and soft, a knife-point was pressed against the centre of one face producing a cut or groove which shows on the back as a slight ridge. Looking through the glass from the edge it can be seen that the piece has a light amber tint like no. 152 above. In dealing with small featureless pieces of glass such as those described here one cannot he dogmatic as to their origin. While one piece may have come from Egypt or the East, allowance must be made for the possibility that all four fragments are from western Dark Age sources. Beads (fig. 13, nos. 387, 350, 484) No. 387 is a yellow cable bead of which one half is present. At first glance the bead appears to be in yellowjonly, but close examination Reveals slight spiral striae in the completely smooth and polished'outer surface which indicate some twisting of the glass before or during manufacture of the bead. It appears likely that this is similar to the seven yellow cable beads described below under Period II" glass objects. In it two cables may have been used, each made up of two strands of glass, one opaque yellow, the other a semi-translucent yellow-green. Overall diameter, 1*3 cm. ; diameter of boring, 5 mm. ; axial length, 6 mm. The bead was found in the north-west quadrant of' the enclosure in the lower layer of refuse. No. 350, whfch is complete, is in light blue translucent glass and like no. 387 is annular in form. It can be seen that, though the bead is completely smooth on the surface, the glass was twisted while held as a straight piece after which the two ends were brought round and pressed together. Fusion of the glass at this point is not complete so that the junction is partially visible. Overall diameter, 1*5 cm. ; diameter of boring, 6 mm. ; axial length, 6 mm. The bead was found at the bottom of a natural hollow in the rock of the entrance causeway and was overlain by a deliberate filling of rock chippings. No. 484 is a segmented bead, complete and in light blue translucent glass of the same colour and quality as the last, though there are a few included bubbles. The bead is well made but the segments are not quite symmetrical. Overall diameter, 1-2 cm. ; diameter of perforation, 6 mm. ; axial length, 1*2 cm. It was found at th? bottom of the lower habitation layer in the south-east quadrant of the enclosure. No. 539 (not illustrated) is a small bead in emerald green translucent glass.

On the other hand the fractured surface may be due to trimming after manufacture as the little bead is somewhat irregular in form. The colout is unlike that of any other bead frorri the site. Overall diameter, 5 mm. ; diameter of perforation, 2 mm. ; axial length, 4 mm. It was found in the north-west quadrant at the bottom of the lower habitation layer. No. 536 (not illustrated) is a small blob of clear glass with green tint. Small bubbles are included in the glass and what appears to be a large central bubble has broken through at one side. This is either a drop of molten glass which fell from the artificer's tool or is an ineffectual attempt at p?king a bead. The broken-through central bubble may be evidence of a failure in making a perfora tion through the glass. In either case it may reasonably be accepted as evidence of glass working on the .site, especially as it was found at the bottom of the primary habitation layer beside the furnace base in the northern part ot the enclosure. PERIOD II Glass Stud (pi. IX and fig. 14) This little object was found in the upper part of the deposit of refuse in the ditch at the north side of the entrance and is likely to have found its way into this position during the second period of occupation of the^ite. It is, therefore, best attributed to Period II. &lt; , It is in light blue translucent glass one half of which exhibits a slight brown ish stain (pi. IX) evidently due to some impurity which became incorporated during manufacture?that is to say the stain is in the body of the glass and not just on the surface. It is circular in form and has an overall maximum diameter of 1 cm. and a thickness of very slightly over 2 mm. It has been made in an open mould and when the moltenor soft glass was pressed into place the excess overran the lip of the mould resulting in a little irregular flange of glass which projects all around the edge of the back surface. The back displays marks which were made by the tool used to press the glass into the mould. While the irregularity of the flange suggests that its presence is accidental, it may be that a little more glass than was needed was used so as deliberately to produce a flange that would subsequently be useful in enabling a metal setting to obtain a secure grip on the stud. A little trimming done by rubbing down would have rendered the flange regular enough for this purpose. Indeed where the flange is widest there are two adjacent flat facets on its edge (pi. IX) which are due either to the beginning of such a rubbing down or to pressure on the glass while still soft with a flat tool. Even under high magnification it is difficult to say whether the striae on the facets are due to abrasive rubbing after the glass had cooled or to movement of the flat tool pressed against the glass while it was still hot and soft. In any event, such an irregular flange is present on the glass stud from Lagore,79 also made in an open mould.

Cork 73 The pattern, which was in intaglio in the mould and hence is in relief on the glass, is a complex one and, both because of its complexity and very small size, it is difficult to imagine its having been worked in intaglio in the clay of the mould itself. It is more likely that the pattern was worked in relief on a prelimin ary model which was then impressed into a piece of clay to make the mould. In fact, a study of the glass reveals that this was the method used, for it can be seen that the model was first impressed in the clay, withdrawn, rotated a little and pressed in once more with greater force. This second pressure almost obliterated the first impression of the pattern, but not quite completely for a few " ghost-like " traces of the first impression remained and these were repro duced in the glass casting. Until one has realized this, the interlaced pattern seems faulty and impossible to follow. But by using a greatly enlarged photo graph, the " ghost-like " traces of the first impression can be eliminated and the pattern becomes easy to follow and is seen to be a correct interlacement through out (fig. 14). Such imperfections as it now has are due to the difficulty which the craftsman had in working an elaborate pattern to an incredibly small size; indeed if one did not have the evidence before one that the pattern was carried out at this size, one would have said that it could not have been done. One can only envy the craftsman his capability to work as accurately as he did under the circumstances. Lack of sharpness of the pattern in the finished stud is due to the difficulty of running the molten glass fully into the minute hollows of the mould and to the fact that some air was trapped between the glass and the mould which resulted in the formation of unwanted hollows and bubbles in the decorated surface. Plate IX shows that the edge of the frontal disc is bordered by a rope moulding which lies between two plain fillets. The surface plane of this feature is a small fraction of a millimetre higher than that of the enclosed circular field of interlacement. Fig. 14 shows that the design of the latter was probably based on a geometrical pattern the elements of which were a square and twelve circles, and we have indicated how the completed pattern may have been worked up from that. It may be assumed that the craftsman had a large-scale set-out of this design before him as he worked the minute version of it in relief on the model from which the mould was made. The working of the design on the model must have been done freehand as it would have been impossible to use an instrument such as a compass to produce the pattern at so small a size. Hence, it is not surprising that there are slight irregularities. Though the lines of interlacement in the original are minutely fine?hair lines almost?the enlarged photograph shows that the treatment is that which was often accorded to a ribbon of appreciable width. This is especially clear in the bifurcation which takes place in the four symmetrically disposed lobes at the edge of the design. It can also be seen at the centre of the pattern where the four main whorls are joined in pairs by the straight ribbons which bifurcate tangentially from the whorl curves. We have found no close parallel for the actual pattern and though one immediately thinks of the little roundels at the foot of folio 5R of the Canon Tables of Kells, these are found to contain much</page><page sequence="58">74 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy simpler interlacements and do not show the bifurcation of the ribbon, though this practice is well seen in many parts of Kells. It was already established in the Book of Durrow, as can be seen in the corner interlaced ornament on folio 192v. In the absence of the actual mould in which the stud was made, we cannot say whether the object is of local manufacture or not. It can have been made at Garryduff but we have no positive evidence one way or the other. Glass Bracelet (fig. 13, no. 500) This object, of which only three fragments were present, was found just under the turf in the north-west quadrant overlying the upper deposit of refuse at a point where this had run over the collapsed face and on to the top of the body of the bank. In this position it must be attributed to the end of Period II. The fragments found fit together to form an irregular curve which is not part of the circumference of a circle, and this shows that distortion took place in the course of manufacture. It is not possible, therefore, to estimate accurately the original size of the bracelet. The body of the bracelet is made of the same dark blue translucent glass as that of the majority of the beads from the site, but inset just below the smooth surface of the periphery are three helixes which have a smoke-blue colour. Seen in section at the fractured ends these helixes are clearly done in white opaque material, the smoke-blue colour being due to the fact that on the outer surface they are seen through a thin stratum of the blue glass of the body of the bracelet. In general, both in the body colour and in that of the inset spirals, as well as in the D-shaped cross-section, the Garryduff example is similar to the bracelets from Lagore80 and Carraig Aille.81 Beads (fig. 13, nos. 35, 74, 75, 282, 348, 488) No. 74 is a cylindrical bead in red opaque glass which has an inset helix of opaque yellow. The red material is hard and glass-like, but the yellow is a soft chalky substance which can be rubbed off. The surface of the red cylinder was provided with a shallow helical channel (about -1 mm. deep) of round-bottomed section and not of constant width?at two points diametrically opposite, it grace fully widens so that the inserted filling of yellow has a much greater surface area at these points. At a number of places the yellow has quite disappeared so that the channel can be seen. Maximum width of yellow helix, 2*5 mm., minimum, 5 mm. Length of bead, 1*3 cm.; diameter, 7 mm.; diameter of boring slightly over 2 mm. The bead was found in the upper layer of refuse within the southern part of House I and belongs to Period II. No. 348 is one of a pair of identical polychrome beads, both found together in the upper layer of refuse in the ditch at the north side of the entrance. They are, therefore, attributable to Period II.

A fillet of yellow opaque material is applied to each end of the barrel-shaped body. These fillets are exactly the same colour as the yellow helix in no. 74, but in this case, while the material has a matt surface finish, it is hard and indestructible. Around the broadest part of the barrel there are set five knops of glass giving the beads a star-shaped appearance. These knops are each in three colours, opaque white against the red barrel followed by a translucent green layer followed by a yellow tip. The beads are, therefore, of rich appearance. Maximum diameter, including knops, 1-9 cm.; barrel-shaped body: maximum, minimum, end diameters including yellow fillets, axial length, diameter of boring: 1*3 cm., 9 mm., 1*2 cm., 1*1 cm,, 5 mm., respectively. Hencken, following Beck, uses the name " horned-eye " for this type of bead, some examples of which were found at Lagore.82 These latter, as well as those from Carraig Aille,83 are different in colour and in other details, but presumably all of them belong to the same general class. As indicators of date they do not appear to be any more useful than the less ornate beads. No. 75 is a bead of clear glass with an inset triskele of yellow spirals. The junction of the three spirals occurs around one end of the central perforation. Overall diameter, 11 mm. ; axial length, 8 mm. ; diameter of boring, 3 mm. It was found in the habitation refuse on top of the south-west bank and clearly belongs to Period II. Beads of this type are well known from the Early Christian Period in Ireland though exactly similar beads come from earlier contexts in Britain such as the Meare Lake Village in Somerset and from Maiden Castle, Dorset.84 Nos. 282 and 527 found as two halves in widely separated areas of the upper layer of refuse in the centre of the enclosure, fit exactly together to make one bead illustrated as no. 282 (fig. 13). This bead is similar to the last in that it also has inset spirals, but in this case there are only two and they are in white against a light blue body. The bead is barrel-shaped and has a maximum diameter and axial length each of 1*1 cm.; the diameter of the boring is 3 mm. No. 488 is an annular bead of clear glass with a slight brownish tint and there are many small bubbles included in the body of the glass. At one end a darker brown spiral line can be seen in the glass. This appears to be accidental and seems to indicate that the bead was made by winding the soft glass around a tool, the diameter of the latter then determining the size of the perforation. Overall diameter, 1*8 cm. ; axial length, 1 cm. ; diameter of boring, 5 mm. Found in the north-west quadrant in the upper layer of refuse. Beads of this type are common in Ireland. Yellow Cable Beads There are seven beads of this class from the upper level of occupation of the site, all of them fragmentary except not 346 (fig. 13). These are called cable beads because they were made by wrapping cables of glass around a central core and rolling while still soft so as to produce a completely smooth surface.

The glass used in this case is a semi-translucent yellow-green both for the core and the cables. In the majority of the Garryduff examples two cables were used (five beads), but besides the four-cable bead mentioned (no. 35), there is one of five cables (in two fragments which fit together but which were found in different parts of the enclosure?nos. 308 and 532) and one of seven (no. 346). In all of the beads each cable is made from two strands of glass. In the majority, the two strands are opaque yellow and semi-translucent yellow-green. In no. 346 (fig. 13), however, there are seven cables, each of two strands?one of clear glass, the other of opaque yellow?wrapped around a core of clear glass. These beads vary in size from no. 346 (the largest) at 1*3 cm. in diameter, 1 cm. in axial length, 6 mm. in diameter of boring to no. 533 (the smallest, not illustrated) which is 9 mm. in diameter and axial length, and has a perforation 4 mm. in diameter. All are of a rather squat barrel shape. They have come from the upper part of the habitation refuse over a wide area in the centre of the enclosure and all belong to Period II. Beads of this kind are well attested at Lagore85 where one example closely resembles our no. 346 in colour and form. Another close parallel for the same bead comes from Carraig Aille,86 while no. 35 is very similar to a bead from Cush.87 Blue Segmented Beads (fig. 13, nos. 485, 487) Four beads of this kind were found in the upper level of refuse in different parts of the enclosure and all are attributable to Period II. The colour is a little lighter than that of the common dark blue beads, but this seems to be due to the fact that a somewhat opaque quality of glass was used in the latter. No. 485 is complete and has four segments, while no. 333 of which only one half was found, had three segments when complete. No. 487 is complete with two segments but, while the existing fragment of no. 290 now displays two segments, it can be seen that it originally had more. Diameters vary from 8 mm. to 6 mm. ; axial lengths from 10 mm. to 7 mm. ; diameter of boring from 4*5 mm. to 3 mm. Beads of this type are well known from several Irish sites. Dark blue beads (fig. 13, nos. 115, 486, 608) There are seven complete beads of this common type and fragments of four others. They have come from the upper level of refuse in all parts of the enclosure and they belong to Period II. All are of the simple squat barrel shape and though there are minor variations in colour, all can be called dark blue.

Cork 77 Green and Yellow Marbled Bead (fig. 13, no. A) This large bead was found by the landowner, Mr. W. O'Mahony, when he dug a trial hole in the south-west quadrant of the enclosure several years before our excavation was begun. The particular hole did not penetrate very deeply and it, therefore, appears very likely that the bead came from the upper stratum of refuse. It is best attributed to Period II. The bead is of annular form, 2-2 cm. in diameter and 1 cm. in axial length. The perforation is 6 mm. in diameter. The main body of the glass is a dark translucent green and there are included bubbles. A random mottling or marbl ing of the surface has been done by laying on meandering strands of yellow glass. While the bead was still soft it was rolled to produce the completely smooth surface it now has. Blob of Blue Glass This object (not illustrated) is a flattened sphere of blue translucent glass slightly lighter in colour than that of the common dark blue beads. It is of interest in that it appears to be a partially made bead. While the blob of glass was still soft it was partially flattened and a pointed tool was pressed into one of the flat faces in an attempt to make a perforation, but the glass had cooled before the tool had gone right through. The opposite flat face shows a rough sur face, the striations on which look not unlike the impressions that might be made by the grain of a piece of wood. It may be that the blob of glass was lying on a piece of timber when the tool was pressed against the uppermost flat in attempt ing to make the perforation. It was found just below the turf near the centre of the enclosure in the narrow area between House I and House II. Overall diameter, 7 mm.; thickness, 3 mm. It may, perhaps, be taken as evidence of glass working on or near the site, especially when taken in conjunction with the blob of green-tinted clear glass described above as having been found near the furnace base on the northern side of the enclosed area. Glass from Vessel (not illustrated) This (no. 537) is a fragment of clear colourless glass which exhibits a double curvature that suggests a small vessel. Maximum dimension, 3 cm. ; thickness, 1 mm. It was found in the south-east quadrant of the enclosure on the surface of the upper habitation layer and, hence, is attributable to Period II. AMBER Only one object in this material was found on the site, a large polyhedral bead (fig. 13, no. 284) found in the north-east quadrant of the enclosure in the lower stratum of habitation refuse where this underlay the inward collapse of the upper part of the bank facing. There is little doubt, therefore, that it belongs to Period I.</page><page sequence="62">78 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy The facets and particularly the arrises were well polished from much rubbing, though some subsequent decay of the surface due to weathering in the soil has rendered the bead somewhat opaque.

STONE OBJECTS A very large number of objects in this material came from all^parts of the site and from both levels of occupation. Most important are the stone trial pieces which will be dealt with first. The remainder are grouped in so far as is possible in related types of object.

X and fig. 15, no. 434) This trial design is incised on one face of a flat thin lamina of soft grey shale, the maximum overall dimensions of which are: length, 6-2 cm.; width, 5 cm.; thickness, 7 mm. This, however; is not its original full size for it is clear that pieces were broken off one end after the interlaced design had been executed. It was found inside the north-west inner face of the bank near the bottom of the upper habitation layer where this overlay the inward collapse of the upper part of the built facing. There is no doubt, therefore, that it belongs to Period II. A rectangular frame lightly incised in freehand lines was set out on the smoother of the two faces of the lamina and this was then divided into four small rectangles by drawing its long and short axes freehand. These two axis lines are so faint that they are difficult to see, and the long axis does not show at all in our photo. To illustrate it a second photograph lighted differently would be necessary; but see our drawing, fig. 15. A panel of interlacement, symmetrical about the long axis, was set within each end of the large rectangle and a compass was used to strike out small circles at important points. Several other compass pricks are also visible and are shown as dots on fig. 15. The remainder of each design was then drawn freehand in light lines which took no cognizance of correct " over and under " crossings of the individual ribbons. The artist then went over his light lines deepening them and arranging the cross-overs correctly as he went along. This can be seen in the original when it is rotated in a low side-light for, as the stone is turned, the original light lines of the incorrect crossings come up one by one. Our photograph (pi. X) lighted from one side shows only a number of them.</page><page sequence="63">w f r i O ? 3 * 370d Fig. 15. Garryduff I?Trial pieces.

Nevertheless, there is no doubt that in-each* human figures are used. In the more complete panel the two bodies are placed facing each other and are fully interlaced, the elongation of the necks allowing for transposition of the heads. Hair and beard are brought out as small threads and after incor poration into the general interlacement, finish in simple coils at the sides of the panel. The other panel, if it had been completed, obviously also would have contained two humans, in this case with the bodies set back to back, an arrange ment which precluded a general interlacement of the two figures. Here, there? fore, the limbs of each body are separately interlaced, union of the iwo bodies being achieved by the elongation of the necks, transposition of the heads and the extension of hair and beard sas threads, these latter treated in the same way as in the other panel. At first glance the headsxappear badly drawn and almost shapeless, but closer scrutiny reveals that quite the reverse is the case. Admit tedly, they are lightly drawn, but some very interesting details are present (fig. 15). What at, first look like noses out of place can be quite definitely seen to be fore locks of hair projecting horizontally above the foreheads, a treatment closely paralleled in the Book of Kells (fol. 130R). That these are not misplaced noses is confirmed by the position of the eye in one of the heads. Our drawing shows these details as they can be seen in the original. They cannot be brought but clearly in a photograph. In reconstructing th? heads (of trie otherwise more complete panel) we have followed the method used by the artist himself in the other panel. The positioning of the reconstructed heads is determined accurately by the survival of the chin of one head just inside the fractured edge of the end of the stone. In the more compl?te panel, mistakes were made in some of the cross-overs of the hair and beard thread-lines which show that here we are dealing with an experimental work?no doubt another attempt would show such imperfections removed. Points particularly worthy of attention, however, are the treatment of the face profiles, hair, hands and feet, the use of compass-drawn circles,88 the division of the main panel by drawing the axis lines and by compass prickings and the dots put in to mark the ankles. These features can be closely paralleled in manuscript designs, particularly in the Book of Kells. In the more complete panel, two compass pricks and their corresponding lightly-drawn circles can be seen where the thighs and calves of the legs inter lace. These pricks and circles have nothing to do with the set-out of the design around them and one wonders why they occur where they do, If we assume that the other (incomplete) panel was done first with the intention of repeating it inverted at the other end of the stone, the two circles in question can be seen as the pelvic circles of the proposed repeat. However, instead of repeating the arrangement of the two bodies already conceived and partially carried out, he drew the two bodies facing each other and developed them into a more complex interlacement. 88 One of the Lagore stone trial pieces shows the use of a compass. See Hencken: P.R.I.A., LUI, C (1950), fig. 89, no. 958.</page><page sequence="65">O'Kell y?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 81 Bird-heads (pi. XI, 370; fig. 16, no. 370) This interesting design was done on one side of a finger of soft shale every facet of which was used as a hone both before and after the design was drawn. The piece of shale is in two fragments found widely separated from each other in the north-west quadrant of the enclosure. The larger piece came from the upper habitation deposit at a point where this had run over the inward collapse of the upper part of the facing and on to the body of the bank ; the smaller piece from the same layer and position but from a point six feet farther west. Both, therefore, belong to Period II. When the pieces are put together the whole measures 12*5 cm. long, 2 cm. in maximum width and 9 mm. in maximum thickness. In this drawing the head is clear but much of the beak has been obliterated by the subsequent use of the surface as a hone. Rotation of the stone, however, in suitable side lighting shows sufficient of the original lines to indicate the general form of the beak (fig. 16, no. 370). Behind the completed head is the gaping beak of another head the rest of which does not appear to have been drawn. The treatment jo? the complete head with the decorative loop behind the eye and the S-curve beginning over the eye and ending lower down in a spiral from which a second spiral originates is close to that which can be found in manuscript sources, but is closer still to the heads on the periphery of the Tara brooch. The smaller fragment has on one edge six cuts in two groups, one group containing two cuts, the other containing four, with a prick or point midway between the groups. Each of the cuts shows a double line in its bottom, these fine parallel lines being divided by a minute raised ridge. The cuts are rather like Ogham scores though, of course, they need be no more than random marks not at all intended as letters. Depending on the direction of reading they can be taken as S*L or D*C. Geometrical Interlacement (pi. XI, 370a; fig. 15, no. 370a) This design is found on the back of the piece just described. Two parallel lines are drawn free-hand on a smooth facet of the stone. At one end of the facet, the ends of the lines turn in diagonally, cross each other at the centre and con tinue to points one-quarter of the way inside the outer lines. From these points they swing inward diagonally again and appear to have been meant to repeat in this manner to the other end of the panel. A second pair of lines, springing from the end of the central axis, was now drawn diagonally outward, looped and drawn diagonally inward again, this arrangement repeating to the end of the panel. The pattern was, therefore, a line interlacement, not a ribbon design, and it is clear that the artist was experimenting and did not finalize the scheme which he obviously had in mind. As the photograph does not show all that can be seen when the original is rotated in a low side-light, we give a drawing in fig. 15 showing the design fully worked out with instruments. When the pattern is thus properly set out, the free-hand loops of the original become semi-circles, but the density of the diagonal lines remains much as in the original.

XII, 31; fig. 15, no. 31) This trial design (no. 31) is done on a pendant hone made from a piece of very fine grained purple slate, measuring 6-7 cm. long, 1-8 cm. wide and 7 mm. thick. The perforation varies from 4 mm. to 7 mm. in diameter. The hone had been well made, all faces having been cut to shape. From use as a hone hollows have developed on the faces and edges. The hour-glass perforation at one end does not seem to have been drilled but rather appears to have been reamed out with a pointed knife. Polish on the inside of the hole, particularly on the upper curve, indicates that the stone was suspended from a thong or cord. As in the last piece described, the decorated surfaces were used again for honing after the designs had been incised and weakness in certain areas is due to a wearing down of the general surface. The object was found inside the southern bank in the uppermost layer of refuse which overlay the inward collapse of the upper part of the built facing. It clearly belongs to Period II. On the completely incised face it can be seen that the scheme of ornamenta tion was based on a series of spirals arranged in a symmetrical pattern beginning with a pair placed side-by-side followed by one centrally placed, this triangular arrangement continuing to the end of the panel. At first glance it would seem that it was intended to link the spirals longitudinally by S-curves and transversely by -curves perhaps to produce a design symmetrical about the long axis, but to do this the spirals should have been arranged to twist in alternate directions.89 In fact, however, all the spirals twist in one direction, the curves arising from a central closed circle. Whether this is to be read asa " mistake " and (when coupled with the coarseness of the execution of the Unes) to be taken as evidence of an inept artist, it is not possible to say. Our drawing (fig. 15, no. 31) is one of several experiments with the design. In it " angular curves " have been made smooth and this change alone gives the design a more pleasing appearance and shows a very involved series of curved linkages. Experiments at rationalizing the pattern into a symmetrical one had the effect of rendering it much less interesting in appearance. Allowance must be made, therefore, for the possibility that this was an attempt at a complex pattern by a serious artist rather than an inexpert doodle by an untrained hand. It is clear that the whole thing was done free hand?not even the centres of the spirals were set down with instruments or by measurement. The marks on the back of the stone consist of a few curved scratches and one double spiral, this arising from a closed circle as on the other face. Bird-heads (pi. XIII, 371, 371a; fig. 16, nos. 371 and 371a) These are found on a thin lamina of fine grained red sandstone which had been carefully shaped and smoothed for use as a hone. The pointed ends were obtained by cutting and the residual marks of this work can be seen in our photo graphs. As before, every part of the stone has been used for honing both before and after the lines were incised on it. The weakness of all the lines is quite clearly 89 See, for instance, the pattern on the north end of the transom of the north cross at Ahenny in Crawford: Carved Ornament (Dublin, 1926), pi. XVII, no. 15.</page><page sequence="68">84 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy due to a post-decoration wearing down of the surfaces. The 'stone measures 14-5 cm. long, 3*5 cm. wide and 8 mm. in maximum thickness. It was found in the surface of the upper habitation layer in the north-west quadrant of ?he enclosure and belongs to Period II. It seems in this case that the incised designs are, for the most part, thought less doodles. The only positively recognizable elements are two bird-heads on one face and a single example on the other. In them the only detail of adornment is. the marking in of the little triangular frame behind the eye in one pair of heads. This is so poorly done that it scarcely shows in pur photograph, though it can be seen in the original (see fig. 16, nos. 371 and 371a). Line Interlacement with Spirals (pi. XIV; fig. 16, no. 345) This trial design occurs on an unshaped finger of soft grey shale on which there are a few small honing facets. The stone measures 16-2 cm. long, 2*9 cm. wide by 1*7 cm. in maximum thickness and the decoration occurs as two separate panels on one broad face. As our photograph shows, the drawing is entirely free-hand but there are obvious attempts at producing symmetrical patterns. As drawn in the original, they are not easy to follow, but close examination clearly reveals the intention of the artist and when this intention is set down mechanically (see fig. 16, no. 345), i.e., when his free-hand drawing is rationalized, it can be seen that here we have two panels, each using the same elements, loosely interwoven in one, tightly interlaced in the other. There can be no doubt whatever that the artist was executing a piece of "knot-work " of a type which is common in all the great works of art of the period. Bruce-Mitford90 has dealt with it in a general way and has^drawn attention to the occurrence of a variant of it with " hooked ?or clubbed loops " in the Book of Lindisfarne and goes on to say that " The clubbed loop is an intrusive and distinctively insular element in interlac?, being apparently nothing else but the form of the broken-backed curve element of Celtic trumpet-spiral ornament, as seen in [his] Fig. 46, XXXIV, transferred to interlace."91 Compare our fig. 16, no. 345 with"fol. 211R where, at the^beginning of the last line but one of decorative capitals, there is an example done in red dots (see tracing of this in our fig. 16). It will be seen that the two are surprisingly close in feeling and even in some details as, for instance, in the points added to the two curves at the left-hand end of the Lindisfarne example. In the original of the Garryduff piece, the added points look at first like corrections, but obviously they are intended as deliberate features of the design. The stone was found in the upper habitation layer where this overlay the inward collapse of the bank in the north-east quadrant and belongs to Period IL Knot Interlace? (pi. XV, no. 470; fig. 16, no. 470) This design appears on a naturally shaped trapezoid of soft7brownish local shale which seems to have suffered a slight burning. There are some traces of 90 Codex Lindisfarnensis, II (I960), p. 216 f. and fig. 49. 91 ibid.</page><page sequence="69">O'Kell y?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork &amp;5 wear frohi use as a hone. Length, 7-8 cm.; maximum width and thickness, 3-4 cm. and 1 cm., respectively. It was found in the south-east quadrant of the enclosure in the upper habitation layer and belongs to Period II. One of the larger faces exhibits near the narrow end a very lightly scratched knot-interlace done rapidly and completely free-hand so that there are irregularities of line and curve which mar the beauty of the design. It is very difficult to show the inter lace photographically because of the lightness of the incision but all the con nections can be seen when the stone is rotated in a suitable side-light. Our illustration (fig. 16, no. 470) is a partial tracing from an enlarged photo and nothing has been done to the design except to draw the sets of diagonal lines straight and parallel and make the relevant connections with smooth sym metrical curves, a thing much easier to do with pen and paper than with stylus point on stone. In the original, the top left-hand corner loop is pointed but the three other corresponding loops are round. We have showr? all four as round loops as the one pointed example seems accidental, but if the design is drawn with points, it is equally pleasing in appearance. This knot-interlace has the same basis as no. 345 above except that the latter is complicated by the addition of the spiral hooks. The remainder of the scratches on this stone do not form an obvious pattern. Disc with scratches (pi. XV, no. 372) This is a rough disc made from a piece of the local red sandstone shale. As such, it is one of many discs the remainder of which will be dealt with below. It was roughed out by chipping to a circular outline followed by a rubbing down of the edge and one face. The other face is untreated. It has an average dia meter of 6*5 cm. and a maximum thickness of 1*2 cm. It was found on the surface of the upper habitation layer in the north-west quadrant of the enclosure and belongs to Period II. The rubbed face bears a poorly scratched spiral, a circle and a few other scratches very roughly executed. Zig-Zag (pi. XV, no. 445) This design occurs on a naturally shaped trapezoid block of clay slate which exhibits a few slight honing facets and a very lightly incised pin groove on one face. The quality of this stone was obviously unsuitable for honing and hence, its slight use for this purpose. One broad face has a very carelessly and rapidly executed double zig-zag-done with a fine point and on the same face a number of other apparently meaningless scratches. Length, 8 cm. ; width, 3-4 cm. ; thick ness, 1*7 cm. Found in the upper habitation layer in the north-west quadrant and belongs to Period II. Scored Pebble (pi. IX, no. 162 and 162a) This is an oval flat water-rolled pebble of soft blue-grey slate or shale. Length, 5*1 cm. ; maximum width and thickness, 24 cm. and 6 mm., respectively.</page><page sequence="70">86 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Found at the bottom of the lower habitation refuse on the old ground level&gt; It belongs, therefore, to Period 1. Both faces were scored with a broad point in such a manner that at first glance one wonders if some form of Runic inscription were intended. Closer examination, however, shows that the scores were made at random and hence are meaningless. MISCELLANEOUS WORKED STONES Cone-shaped Stones (?g. 17, nos. 39, 144, 156) Three of these enigmatic objects were found in different areas within the enclosure, two from the upper habitation layer and one from the lower. They, therefore, belong to Periods I and II. All are made from a comparatively fine grained local red-sandstone and are carefully shaped and smoothed throughout. None shows ? polished surface and there is no evidence that they were used as hones. One gets the impression that they were some sort of tool, perhaps used by a craftsman, but any suggestion as to their particular use can only be a guess. No. 144 is the best and most carefully made example in that it has a well shaped head on the broad end of its conical body. No. 39 is longer, slightly curved and has a rudimentary head. No. 156 is a perfectly straight cone with, no trace of head. All have neatly rounded points. Lengths from 7*5 cm. to 4*2 cm.; maximum diameters from 1*8 cm. to 1*4 cm. A similar object came from the ring-fort at Carrigmurish, Co. Waterford.92 Pendants (fig; 17, nos. 255, 433) There are two of these objects both made from pieces of shale. No. 255 is from the lower habitation layer and no. 433 comes from the upper. No. 255 is a small rectangular slip of shale with smoothed surfaces and rounded corners. There is a small perforation near one end reamed out with, a pointed knife, not drilled. The shale in this case is a grey variety available locally, but is much too' soft for use as a/hone or for any such abrasive work. The hole shows a slight polish in its upper arc, hence the suggestion that it was a pendant. Length, 3*9 cm. ; width, 1-9 cm. ; thickness, 3 mm. ; diameter of hole, 2 mm. No. 433 is in red soft shale, has a scalloped edge done by cutting and rubbing and has a perforation near one end. The latter appears to have been drilled. It shows a polish from the rubbing of a suspension cord. Length, 6*1 cm.; width, 2*4 cm.; thickness, 5 mm.; diameter of boring, 6 mm. Plaques (fig. 17, nos. 393, 423, 502, 584) These objects are carefully shaped pieces of stone, two from the lower habita tion and two from the upper and therefore, they belong tp Periods I and II. There is no ornamentation and no indication of the use to which they were put (no. 423 has an incipient perforation). Three of them (393, 423 and 502) ?r? 92 Ussher: J.R.S.A.I., XVII (1885-86), pi.

Garrydufi I?Miscellaneous stone objects Perforated Slip of Shale (fig. 17, no. 400) This object was found just below the turf on the surface of the upper habita tion layer and belongs to Period II. It consists of a thin slip of soft grey shale 9-3 crm long and tapering in width from 1*3 cm. to 9 mm. Its maximum thickness is 3 mm., Its edges are carefully cut to slight curves, but both ends are fractured (when found it was in five fragments). There are three perforations (made by reaming with a knife, not by drilling) spaced approximately at 2-3 cm. centres. Diameters vary from 4 mm. to 2 mm., the smallest hole being that at the centre. It is impossible to say what this object was used for. Strike-a-light (not illustrated) A water-rolled pebble of hard sandstone which exhibits a broad shallow groove in each face. It is a typical example of the kind of object commonly</page><page sequence="72">88 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy called a " strike-a-light " or/' tracked Stone,V Found in the upper habitation layer overlying the collapse of the inner facing of the bank on the south-east. Maximum diameter, 7 cm.; grooves, 3 cm. long and 2 mm. deep. Stone Rubbers (not illustrated) Two of these were found, one in the lower and one in the upper habitation. Both are water-rolled sandstone pebbles each having one striated flattened face which is due to abrasive rubbing on another stone. Maximum dimensions vary from 8-4 cm. to 3*5 cm. Shale Bracelet (not illustrated) Only a short fragment of this survives. After breaking, the fractured ends were cut smooth with a knife and a small partial perforation was made on the inner curve near one end. The drilling does not go through ta the outside. The section is D-shaped. Length on curye, 6 cm. Found under turf in the surface of the upper habitation layer. Stone Lamps (fig. 18, nos. 262, 604) About one-third of no. 262 survives but from this portion it can be seen that when complete it consisted of a hemispherical stone (gritty sandstone) hollowed out to a bowl shape by pocking. The overall diameter at the mouth was approxi mately 7 cm. and the internal depth was 2*5 cm. A roughly pocked-out groove runs across the lip. The interior is coated with a black soot stain and this runs up into the groove on the lip. On the sectional profiles revealed at the fractured edges, it can be seen that the black stain penetrates from the inside into the stone to a depth of 5 mm. These details seem to leave little doubt that the object was a lamp. It was found just below the turf on the upper habitation layer where this ran on to the bank at the north side of the fort. It belongs, therefore, to Period II, No. 604 is made from a small irregularly-shaped, gritty sandstone boulder. On one facet a shallow oval hollow has been pocked out. There is no groove on the lip and there is no trace of soot stain inside the hollow, so that this cannot be identified certainly as a lamp, though the interpretation seems the most likely one. The inside of the hollow is rough showing that it was not used as a mortar. The axes of the oval mouth of the hollow are 5 and 7 cm., respectively, and the internal depth is 1*8 cm. It was found on top of the collapse from the bank in the north-west quadrant and belongs to Period II. Stone with Incised Diaper Pattern (fig. 19, no. 605) This object is a flat undressed slab of sandstone on one face of which a '" draught-boardM pattern has been lightly incised in free-hand lines. The pattern is not carefully drawn so that the " squares " vary in size and shape. The lay-out is based on six squares per side so that there are thirty-six squares in all. Measured on the central axes the pattern is 13*7 cm. by 15 cm. A smooth area at one corner and many pock-marks over the surf ace generally, indicate that the stone was used as a hone and as an anvil subsequent to the drawing of the</page><page sequence="73">O'Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 89 lines. The pattern may, therefore, be no more than a thoughtless doodle, but perhaps it was used in the playing of some game in which the smallest of the stone discs (see below) were used as counters. The stone was found in the south-west quadrant of the enclosure in the upper habitation level and belongs to Period II. Fig. 18. Garryduff I?Stone lamps Spindle Whorls (not illustrated) These objects were numerous on the site and have come from all parts of the enclosure. There are seventeen complete whorls and one broken example, all of which come within the normal size range; nine others unfinished or broken are in a larger than normal size. Of the total of twenty-seven examples (see one other in bone described above), seven came from the lower level of habitation refuse and twenty from the upper. As in other things, the objects occur in greater numbers in Period II. None are ornamented and all are made from the local varieties of stone shale and sandstone of various colours and qualities. Finish varies considerably, some being perfectly circular with well-drilled centre holes and smooth faces and edges, while others were left in a rough condition. In the normal size-range diameters vary between 2-5 cm. and 5-5 cm. ; thicknesses between 3 mm. and 7 mm. The centre holes are for the rnost part hour-glass borings, though a few exhibit cylindrical drillings. The effective centre hole diameters vary between 5 mm. and 1 cm.</page><page sequence="74">go Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy The larger whorls all have a rough unfinished appearance. The majority are made from laminae pf shale roughly brought to a circular shape and drilled at the centre. There are both cylindrical and hour-glass perforations. Diameters vary between 8 cm. and 6*3 cm. ; thicknesses between 2-4 cm. and 3 mm, ; borings between 1*6 cm. and 6 mm. Stone Discs (not illustrated) These objects were very numerous on the site. There were ninety-eight examples in all, twenty from the lower level of habitation refuse and seventy-eight from the upper. The discs have come from all areas of the enclosure and from the ditch on the north side of the entrance. In the lower level, the distribution was?south-west quadrant: 9; south-east quadrant: 5; north-west and north east quadrants : 3 each. In the upper level?north-west quadrant : 26 ; south-west quadrant: 22; north-east quadrant: ^18; south-east quadrant: 12. Thus, the greatest number came Irom the south-west quadrant in Period I and from the north-west quadrant in Period II, but it does not appear that these slight differences in distribution' have any particular significance. Considering the group of discs as a whole, there is a continuous variation in diameter from the smallest at 2 cm. to the largest at 16*5 cm.?that is to say, each disc is just slightly larger than the one next in size below. Thickness varies very considerably from 1*5 mm. to 3*4 cm., as does also the finish. Some discs in every part of the size-range are very well finished, having perfectly .smoothed surfaces and carefully made edges; others are just rough-outs and are quite unfinished on edges and faces. One disc (see above under Trial Pieces) has a scratched spiral on one face, but otherwise there is no ornamentation. The largest disc (16*5 cm. diameter) of which only about a third survives, was very perfectly made from hard fine-grained sandstone. Both faces are completely flat, parallel and smooth and exhibit what amounts to a slight polish." The edge, which is nicely rounded off, is perfectly circular and it is evident that much care was taken in manufacturing it. Such a disc as this, as well as five others very similar in fineness of manufacturo (diameters: 10*5 cm.; 10*8 cm. ; 13 cm. ; 13 cm. ; 14 cm.), might be thought of as pot-covers though this can be no more than a suggestion. Five discs in the medium to small size-range (diameters from 3 cm. to 8 cm. ; thicknesses from 14 cm. to 7 mm.) have their centre points marked by a prick or punch-mark. These can be considered unfinished spindle-whorls though this, too, may be an unwarranted assumption. One rough disc (diameter, 5 cm.) has a small neatly made perforation (3 mm. diameter) at its edge and two incomplete perforations at other points just inside the edge. The complete hole does not show a polish from a suspension cord. Another medium-sized disc (6*5 cm. diameter) which is little more than a rough-out in a rather coarse sandstone, has an incipient pin groove on one face. A thick disc (diameter, 5 cm.; thickness, 24 ^em.) in fine grained red sandstone has on one face a central polished-out hollow which seems to be due to use of the stone as a base on which to grind something with a pestle. A well-made disc 7 cm. in diameter and 2 cm. thick shows an abraded area on one</page><page sequence="75">Q'Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 91 face due to use: as a hammer- or anvil-stone. Finally, a thick, rough, unfinished disc (diameter, 5*5 cm. ; thickness, 3*4 cm.) has an incipient groove around its periphery a&amp; if it were intended to cut the stone into two discs. Stone discs are found on sites of every period in Ireland from the neolithic downward93 and have never been satisfactorily explained. Garryduff has pro duced probably the largest single collection, but despite this, no good explanation can still be offered for them. They cannot all be unfinished spindle-whorls and the suggestion that they are defensive ammunition does not seem acceptable. This might be, a possibility if they had been found in groups say, near the entrance to the fort (as sling-stones have been found in other sites). Under the circum stances, " counters for a game " seems still as good an explanation as any other I Perhaps the smallest discs were used with the diaper-patterned stone described above. Fig. 19.

The majority have the form of a rectangular prism but four are cylindrical. Two were perforated for suspension, while twenty-one exhibit one or more pin grooves. The quality of stone used varies very considerably from a soft grey mud-Stone to a hard fine-grained red sandstone, all of which varieties of stone are available in the locality. Querns (not illustrated) On a site which otherwise showed so much activity it was surprising that only a few fragments of what was probably one pair of quern-stones came to light. The quality of stone is identical in all?a coarse, gritty red sandstone. There are four fragments in all, three from an upper and one from a lower-stone, and all were found in one of the spoil heaps in the south-west quadrant beside one of the pits dug by the landowner several years before our excavation was undertaken. As the particular pit was a shallow one, it is very likely that the fragments came from the upper level of occupation and should, therefore, belong to Period II. Two fragments of the upper stone fit together to give about one-quarter of that quern and portions of the edge and of the centre hole are included. The measurements which can thus be established are : centre hole diameter, 9*5 cm. ; overall diameter, 44 cm.; maximum thickness, 6*5 cm. Greatest wear of the grinding surface is in the area near the edge of the stone, but the slightly dished area around the centre hole also shows some wear from use. The rynd-bar chases are not preserved nor is there any evidence of the nature of the handle used for turning the stone. The fragment of lower stone, about one-fifth of the whole, preserves portion of the centre hole and edge of the quern. Thus the following dimensions can be established: diameter of centre hole, 2*5 cm. ; overall diameter, 38 cm. ; thickness, 7*5 cm. maximum. There is no evidence of the nature of the pivot nor of how it was fixed in the centre hole. The working surface is high in the centre and slightly dished in the annular area around the centre. The surface shows most wear near the edge. FLINT Fifty-four pieces of flint were found distributed fairly evenly over the whole of the site, including the filling of the ditch on the north side of the entrance. Almost all are of quite small size due to the fact that they are made from little nodules evidently picked up locally. Almost every one of the flints retains part of the cortex of the parent nodule. To discover if they could have been obtained locally a rapid search was made in a few patches of gravel in the bed of a stream less than a quarter of a mile east of the site and in the space of a few minutes twenty nodules of flint of similar size were collected, while a walk across a nearby ploughed field provided another thirty nodules. Colour and quality of the flint in the artifacts (and collected nodules) vary widely as would be expected under such circumstances.</page><page sequence="77">O'Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 93 Of the collection of fifty-four pieces from the excavation, twelve came from the lower level of occupation and forty-two from the upper. The majority are, therefore, attributable to Period II. Seventeen pieces from Period II and one piece from Period I show secondary working done by a pressure-flaking technique, while the remaining thirty-six pieces are waste fragments and flakes. Accidental serration of one or more edges in some of these shows that they were used to some extent for scraping and other purposes. The onef artifact from the Period I level (no. 257, ?g. 20) is a little keeled scraper with steeply retouched sides. Its maximum dimension is 1*8 cm. Round Scrapers (fig. 20, nos. 206, 351, 457, 464a, 465) Five small round scrapers were found, all from Period II. Four of them retain areas of the cortex of the parent nodules from which they were made, while the fifth shows an all-over,flaking of its convex surface. It is clear that the method of manufacture was to split the more or less spherical nodule into halves and then execute a steep pressure-flaking around the edge. Diameters vary from 1-6 cm. to 2*3 cm. and colour from a grey opaque white through translucent amber to a dull opaque brown. Hollow Scrapers (?g. 20, nos. 13, 260, 266, 459, 464) Hollow scrapers are unusual in any context in the south of Ireland and hence the group of five from the site are of special interest. All are from different parts of the enclosure and all are from Period II. Again, these are made from nodular flint as is shown by areas of cortex surviving on four of them. Colour varies from a very dark grey to white. The best example is no. 459, a flake struck from a nodule that must have been about 4 cm. in diameter. This has two hollows placed side-by-side which are very neatly produced by pressure-flaking. The polish along the working edges often seen on neolithic flints of this type is absent here. Maximum dimension, 3*8 cm. No. 464 has a hollow scraping edge of almost equal size and quality but the three others have only very slight hollows. Other Scrapers (fig. 20, nos. 10, 140, 212, 328, 335, 460) These are variously shaped fragments from nodules of different colours and quality which have been turned into scrapers by means of a steep pressure-flaking along one or more edges. The steep scraping edge of no. 335 is somewhat reminis cent of mesolithi? and neolithic examples. All are from Period II. Flake Knife (?) ( fig. 20, no. 67) This object is a flake from a nodule of poor quality grey-white opaque flint. The striking platform and bulb of percussion are clearly identifiable at the base of the,flake which is leaf-shaped in outline. The cutting edge is gapped from use and the back of the blade retains the cortex of the nodule throughout its length. Maximum dimension, 5*2 cm. Found just below the turf in the south-west quad rant and belongs to Period II.</page><page sequence="78">94 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy cm. Fig. 20. Garryduff I?Flint objects</page><page sequence="79">0'Kell y?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 95 CRUCIBLES Three complete crucibles were found on the site, as well as twenty-four fragments. Though some of the fragments can be joined together, it is not possible to make up further complete examples, but it can be determined with reasonable reliability that ten are represented by the sherds. It may be said, therefore, that there are thirteen crucibles in all from the site. Even though the number is small, they must be taken as evidence of metal- and probably glass working on the site. Also, they give evidence of certain interesting technical points in regard to the manner of their use. The three complete crucibles and fragments of two others came from the lower level, while the remainder of the fragments, amounting to five crucibles, came from the upper level of habitation. The objects are, therefore, about evenly divided between Period I and Period II. While fragments have come from each quadrant of the site and from the ditch at the north side of the entrance, a very slight predominance of occurrence in the western area of the enclosure was noticeable. Of the three complete crucibles from Period I, two are of particular interest because they were fitted with covers when in use. No. 374 (fig. 21) which is complete in every respect, consists of a small crucible with rounded base inside and out, the sides rising to a triangular mouth. The corner of the mouth in tended for use as a pouring beak is the sharpest of the three?the two others seem to be well rounded off. The vertical internal height is 3-1 cm., while the same measurement taken externally is 4*1 cm. The thickness of the base is, therefore, 1 cm. The side-walls thin out as they come up until at the Up they are as little as 2 mm. in thickness. The lengths of the sides of the triangular mouth average 3 cm. Before it was first fired, a carefully made cover was fitted over the mouth, the edges of the clay from which it was made being bent down outside the crucible top and carefully luted in place except over the pouring beak. Here, the edge of the cover was turned upward so as to leave an opening for charging and subse quently for pouring out the molten contents. Rising from the centre of the cover is a lug-handle which, presumably, was provided so as to facilitate handling the crucible when hot. By catching the lug with a tongs, the crucible could easily be placed in the furnace and manipulated for pouring when removed subsequently. The length of the lug is 2 cm. and its rectangular section measures 1*5 cm. by 7 mm. just above its base. Both crucible and cover were made from a comparatively fine clay, now a dirty grey colour, though the base of the lug-handle and part of the cover show a pink tint. There is a very slight vitrification or glazing of the external bottom and sides, but this effect is hardly noticeable at the top. The inside is quite clean and shows no trace of whatever material was heated in it. This crucible was found on the same level as and 2' 6" to the north of the furnace base in the northern part of the enclosure. No. 369 (fig. 21), found Y west of the furnace base, is of the same general form, but is smaller and its cover is missing, though there is clear evidence that</page><page sequence="80">96 Proceedings of the1 Royal Irish Academj? it originally had one?parts of the bent-over luted edge survive. Internal vertical, height, 2*2 cm.; external height, 3*1 cm. The triangular mouth is somewhat irregular, the sides measuring 3 cm., 2*8 cm. and 2*5 cm., respectively. The, interior is clean and gives no evidence of the nature of the material heated in hp. The external bottom exhibits the same very slight vitrification or glazing noticed in no. 374. The lightness of the glaze in both cases means that the crucibles,saw little use, but it is clear that in using them they had to be placed on the fire in. the furnace since they could not be heated from above (because of the covers) as we will see was4 done with some open crucibles. Perhaps such covered crucibles were intended for making glass, the covers being necessary so as to exclude impurities, small amounts of wlu?h could affect the colour of the finished product, But, if they had been used for glass, one would expect some residue to have remained on the internal surfaces. Close parallels for these come from Dinas Powis, Glamorganshire, and from lona.94 Other handled crucibles come from Dunadd, Argyllshire,95 Ballinderryll96 and St. Gobnet's House.97 , The third complete example (fig. 21, no. 475) was found in the south-east quadrant of the enclosure in the lower habitation layer. It is of the same general form as the two just described, but did not have a cover and shows no trace of external glaze. Internal height, 2*3 cm.; external, 3-1 cm.; lengths of sides of mouth, 3*5, 3*5 and 4 cm., respectively. The external colour is a dirty grey but around the lip and in the interior the clay is a grey-pink and there is no residue inside to indicate what was heated in it. The pink colour of the top edge and of the interior suggests to us that this crucible was heated from the top in an oxidizing atrnosphere and to do this the use of a blow-pipe must be postulated. As we shall ?ee (no. 497 below), a small fragment of what almost certainly was such a blow-pipe has come from Garryduff. The next most interesting example (no. 109, fig. 21) is incomplete and that portion of it which survives is made up of a number of fragments which, fit together, but which were found scattered in the upper level of habitation in the western area of the enclosure. This is a different type to those described in 4hat it was shallower in the interior and was almost circular at the mouth. Though the external bottom has not survived, enough remains to show that it must have been almost flat or at best can only have had a slight curvature and that it was thicker than the bases of the normal pyramidal type. There are fragments of at least three other crucibles of this kind (fig. 21, nos. 174,174a, 80) from Garryduff and they may be compared to the open flat-based circular examples from Lagore98 and Ballinderry II99 and to the shallow circular, almost flat-based crucibles from Garranes. Some of these latter are glazed all over, both inside and out, and were, therefore, used on the fire as were flie pyramidal types. Others 94 Information kindly supplied by Mr. Leslie Alcock, Cardiff. **P.S:A.S., LXIV (1929-30), 123, fig. 8, no. 2; ibid., XXXIX (1904-5), 314, figs. 36-38. ??Hencken: P.R.I.A., XLVII, C (1942), 50 and fig. 20, no. 192.

Cork 97 of this Garranes group are glazed on the inside only, indicating heating from above. ? R?ord?in100 mentions only one of them, though there are fragments of at least ten amongst the Garranes material. The clay used in the Garryduff circular crucibles is the same fine grey material described above, but in the body of the bottom parts of them it has been oxidized to a pink colour. Glaze in all of them is confined to the inside surface and to the top and outer edge of the lip. The outer surfaces are quite clean and free from glaze. The internal and lip glaze is a mottled olive green and deep red colour and its absence from the outside indicates not only that these crucibles were heated from above by means of a blow-pipe but also that, while they were being so heated, they were embedded in some substance, perhaps in sand, though more likely in some sort of clay holder which could be used for manipulating the crucible while pouring out its molten contents. This evidently indicates a different process from that for which the open pyramidal all-over-glazed types were used. Hencken suggested that his flat-based shallow types might have been used as stands for the pyramidal crucibles and thought that this might explain the external glaze on the one type and the internal glaze on the other. This explana tion is unacceptable and as indicated above (as well as by ? R?ord?in when considering the hemispherical crucibles from Garranes101), the internal glazing is due to direct heating from overhead with the aid of a blow-pipe. They were not stands but crucibles in their own right. Another point of interest about some of these circular flat-based crucibles from Garryduff is that each time they were used a fresh clay lining was put in to cover the residue of the previous melt. The section of no. 109 shows that it was used three times, there being two added internal linings, while other fragments . show one added lining. This feature can also be seen in some of the crucibles from Dalkey Island.102 Does this mean that it was important to prevent the residue of slag and vitreous matter left in the crucible after one usage from becoming molten and incorporating itself into whatever was being melted when the crucible was used for the second or third time ? Nos. 473 and 474 (fig. 21) represent a third type of crucible?shallow, flat based and with a triangular mouth. The illustrated fragment of no. 474 is the angle used as a pouring lip and shows a thick accretion of matter grey-white in colour, the residue of" whatever molten material was poured out of it. No. 473 (not illustrated) is another such pouring lip and its accretion of glassy matter is also grey-white, but there is a mottling with light green which resembles the colour of copper carbonate. The remaining crucible fragments are from the open pyramidal types with all-over external glaze strongly developed. This, for the most part, is of a greenish grey colour, though there are traces of deep red on the outsides of some fragments. wp.RJA., XLVII, C (1942), 50 and fig. 20, no. 313. 101 P.R.I.A., XLVII, C (1942), 138.

Cork 99 In no instance is there any trace of an obviously metallic residue (as at Garranes) adhering to the insides of any of these fragments, nor indeed is there any marked vitrification or glazing of the inner faces either, so that the purpose for which they were used is not clear. Blow-pipe Fragment (fig. 21, no. 497) This small fragment was found on the old ground surface in the north-west quadrant and belongs to Period I. It is almost certainly a piece of the nozzle of a blow-pipe made from clay. It had a tapering form like those from Lagore103 and Garranes104 and the effective diameter of the hole through it was about 9 mm. Its tip has a thick green glaze similar to that on some of the crucibles, but behind the tip and on the inside there is no glaze. ' Hencken called the blow-pipe from Lagore " probably a tuy?re or nozzle for a bellows "105 and in doing so was probably thinking of a furnace tuy?re, as also was ? R?ord?in in dealing with what he called a " tuy?re or nozzle-like end for a blow-pipe used to introduce a blast into a furnace."106 Such blow-pipes were probably used in conjunction with a bellows, but from experiments we have made in the course of studying the technique of iron smelting in ancient Ireland, we now know that the furnace tuy?re had a completely different form (see below under iron smelting). IRON SMELTING Evidence of iron smelting on the site is of several related kinds?furnaces, tuy?res, " furnace bottoms," slag and stocks of ore. Some of these evidences have come from both levels of habitation refuse and hence it is clear that this craft was being practised in Period I and Period II. Furnaces In Period I good evidence of a single furnace was found (plan, pi. Ill) just beyond the north-west corner of House II (pi. XVI). It had been built directly on the old ground surface and quite clearly belonged to the earliest phase of occupation. It had consisted of a bowl-like structure more or less circular in plan, built of clay and small stones, its maximum overall diameter being four feet. The surviving part had a maximum height of seven inches and when complete it is unlikely to have been more than about twelve inches high. The wall was nine inches to about one foot thick and surrounded a hollow four inches deep and one foot in diameter. The bottom of the hollow consisted of a 3-inch layer of clay laid on the old ground surface. The whole of the furnace base 103 Hencken: P.RJ.A., LUI, C (1950), 126, fig. 60, no. 1332. 104 ? R?ord?in: P.RJ.A., XLVII, C (1942), 139, fig. 25, no. 262. ? R?ord?in figured only one blow-pipe nozzle as such, but amongst the Garranes material there are fragments of at least fifteen. His no. 192 in fig. 25 is not a crucible but a blow-pipe nozzle. 105 op. cit., p. 126. loe;op. cit., p. 139.</page><page sequence="84">ioo Proceedings of the Royal Irish A cademy m* mm i ; St AG ACCRETION % * ?. ** 267a FAONT !

Cork ioi (both clay and stones) was burnt to a red colour, the inner layers of the clay being partly vitrified. Immediately south of the furnace there was a dump of clean yellow clay which appeared to have been specially provided so as to be available for sealing the tuy?re into position and for other such purposes. A con siderable amount of iron slag covered the ground about the furnace. Two small crucibles (nos. 369 and 374 above) were found close by. These, however, would not have been used in connection with iron smelting. A small blob of glass was also found in the soil near at hand (no. 536 above). These finds can reasonably be taken as evidence that the furnace was being used for other purposes as well as for iron smelting and this supports our belief that it was a low bowl type comparable to the standard shallow pit-type common in these islands?not the tall " chimney-furnace " of central Europe. This latter type cannot readily be used for anything other than smelting whereas the Irish bowl or pit can be used with open top as a forging hearth or for heating crucibles containing other materials. While this was the only furnace built above ground, iron smelting had been carried on at several other points within the enclosure in Period II in the common pit-furnace, of which six examples were recorded. These were simple circular hollows, varying in diameter from 1' to 1' 6" and in depth from 9* to 1', their sides being heavily burnt. In and around them quantities of iron slag were found, as well as fragments of the original lining?burnt clay partially vitrified and coated with slag. We know from the experiments mentioned above that the clay lining rarely survives intact after the products of a smelt have been removed (there are technical reasons for this) and the absence or very fragmentary condition of such a lining often makes it difficult to identify a furnace when it is found in an excavation. " Furnace Bottoms " Fragments of at least forty-four of these objects were found. Each of them consists of a hemispherical lump of iron-rich, heavy, slag-like material formed in the bottom of the furnace, the shape of the lump being determined by the shape of the furnace itself. Hence, when such lumps are found complete, they are a useful guide to the shape and size of the furnace which produced them. Their formation is due to the collection in the bottom of the pit of slag formed higher up during the course of the smelt, though they can also be due to the failure of a smelt when the whole charge becomes molten and sinks to the bottom. Tuy?res (fig. 22, nos. 267 and 267a) Eight tuy?res were recognized with certainty from the larger fragments and many more were represented amongst the smaller pieces, but as these sherds could not be joined together; it is not possible to give a reliable estimate of the total number. Fragments of two are illustrated (fig. 22). All had the character istic form as shown by a fairly complete example from Carrigmurish,107 Co. 107 An old find, now in the Cork Public Museum, from a ring-fort excavated by R. J. Ussher. See J.R.S.A.I., XVII (1885-86), 362 ff. The report does not mention or illustrate the tuy?re. Ga</page><page sequence="86">102 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Waterford (fig. 22, A). A complete tuy?re of this type was a piece of clay more or less cylindrical in shape up to about 20 cm. long and up to about 15 cm. in diameter. Lengthwise through it a funnel-shaped hole was made and when the tuy?re was in position on the edge of the pit- or bowl-furnace, the hole through it lay radially with respect to the furnace and was angled downward into it. The outer end of t?^e hole through the tuy?re had a large diameter, up to 10 cm., while the inner end, that through which the air actually entered the furnace, was small?from 2 cm. to 3 cm. in diameter. The blow-pipe holes are smaller?in the examples we have been able to measure, they do not exceed 1-5 cm. In using the furnace a continuous draught was essential to develop the 1,100? C. to 1,200? C. necessary for useful reduction of the ore (not 800? C. or 900? C. as has often been stated). The ends of the wooden pipe-nozzles from the bellows were laid side-by-side into the open funnel-end of the tuy?re and the latter was long enough not to conduct heat outward from the furnace so that they did not get burnt (if they are sealed with clay into position in the end of the tuy?re, they quickly go on fire). As each blast of air from the alternately worked bellows passes into the furnace, it draws in with it some of the surrounding air through the open end of the tuy?re, thus increasing the efficiency of the forced draught which penetrates downward into the heart of the charge of charcoal and ore. Only the inner end of the tuy?re is affected by the burning charge in the furnace, this part of it being converted into a pottery-like substance. The surface in contact with the full heat of the burning charge becomes vitrified and coated with slag dribbling down from the gangue of the ore. The outer part of the tuy?re does not receive enough heat to convert it to pottery and when the furnace is opened at the end of the smelt, this part of the tuy?re crumbles away and eventually weathers down to formless clay once more. The inner vitrified part usually becomes united through the slag with the bloom of smelted iron and when the latter is being taken out the tuy?re gets broken. It is for these reasons that tuy?res are rarely preserved in a complete state and hence the difficulty which excavators have had in recognizing them. They have often been dealt with as "slag," " vitrified or glazed clay " or " fragments of furnace lining." In our own case we once identified them very incorrectly as "furnace covers " and the interpretation of their use which we gave in the published account108 of the site which produced them, St. Gobnet's House, Ballyvourney, Co. Cork, can now be seen to be completely wrong in the light of what we have learned since from our own experiments. Slag A large quantity of slag came from all parts of the site but particularly from the vicinity of the furnaces. This is of the light glassy type (not containing much iron) which became quite molten and flowed down the sides of the pit-furnace, 108O'Kelry: J.?.H.A.S., LVII (1952), 34, fig. 3, nos. 1-3. It was our dissatisfaction with the interpretations given in this report which led us to undertake research into the problems of iron smelting in general, A preliminary report on the work was given at the Congress for Pre- and Proto-historic Sciences at Hamburg in 1958. See Bericht, ?ber den V. Internationalen Kongress, Hamburg (Berlin, 1961), pp. 459-461.</page><page sequence="87">O*Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 103 particularly in the region of the tuy?re where the temperature is greatest. Much of it adheres also to the bloom of iron and is broken off by hammering when the bloom is taken from the furnace for forging. Ore The ore used at Garryduff was a hard stony yellow ochre presumably quarried from an outcrop of Yellow Sandstone or Lower Limestone Shale and could have been readily obtained in the locality.100 It is a low-grade ore. Pieces of it, some of them quite large lumps, were found all over the site, but particularly in the vicinity of the furnaces. Small fragments of it can be seen adhering to the slags and " furnace bottoms " so there is no doubt that it was being used as a source of iron on the site. Near one of the Period II furnaces in the upper habitation level, a small dump of pieces of a red ore was found. The quantity was enough for one charge of the furnace. As the geological structure of the individual pieces was very similar to that of the ore described above, it seemed certain that this, too, was yellow ochre which had been roasted preparatory to smelting. To check if this was the case a few representative pieces of the yellow ochre were roasted in an open fire for a short period. When they were taken out and allowed to cool, they were found to have developed exactly the same colour and appear ance as those from the dump. Though this is the only evidence we have of it, it seems likely that the yellow ochre ore was roasted at Garryduff as a preliminary to smelting. POTTERY The total amount of pottery from the site is small, eighty-five sherds all told. In the collection thirteen individual vessels can be distinguished with certainty, while four others can be postulated?that is a probable seventeen in all. The four less certain vessels are based on a differentiation of a small group of sherds on the basis of colour and quality of fabric alone. These, however, are not reliable indicators and it can be demonstrated very clearly in the Garryduff material itself that colour and quality vary to a surprising degree in different sherds of the same vessel, a variation which must be due to differential weathering of the sherds since they became embedded in the habitation refuse on the site. Further reference will be made to this matter below. The pottery shows, perhaps, more clearly than any other group of objects from the site that the interval between Period I and Period II was short because exactly the same wares have come from both levels of occupation. Furthermore, fragments which fit together and therefore belong to the same pot have come from both levels. For instance, no. 99 (fig. 23) is made up of twenty sherds from Period I and three sherds from Period II, the latter having been found in the north-east quadrant, the former in the south-west ! This, of course, can be due to disturbance of the Period I deposit by the Period II occupants and such 109 Information kindly supplied by Dr. W. E.

Garryduff I?Pottery</page><page sequence="89">O'Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 105 disturbance is bound to have occurred here and there in the making of post-holes, the digging of pits, the scooping out of furnace pits and so on. Where a vessel is made up of sherds from both levels, the pot is attributed to the level from which the majority of the sherds came. This system cannot be a reliable guide in every case, particularly if the number of sherds is small, say two from one level, one from the other, or when an equal number of sherds that appear to belong to the same vessel has come from each level. Bearing these difficulties and uncertainties in mind, we have attributed seven vessels to Period I and ten to Period II. Fifteen vessels fall quite definitely into the E-ware110 category. A sixteenth (represented by two sherds) is difficult to place?it may belong in this same category or may be post-Norman in date. The seventeenth vessel falls into Thomas' G-ware group. E-ware, therefore, forms the main body of the Garryduff pottery and quite clearly table ware of the A group and amphorae of the B group are absent. The fifteen definite E-ware vessels can be segregated with consider able reliability into ten E i jars and five E ii (Buston) beakers. The sixteenth and somewhat anomalous pot may be an E iv pitcher if it is not mediaeval, i.e., post Norman (see sherds 342 and 410 below). Having regard to the cautions expressed above, five E i jars and two E ii beakers can be attributed to Period I, while five E i jars, three E ii beakers, the very doubtful E iv pitcher and the single piece of G-ware can be placed in Period II. PERIOD I No. 99, an E i jar (fig. 23) is made up from twenty-three sherds in four groups numbered on the excavation 34, 99, 272 and 407, the two latter (compris ing three sherds) having come from Period II, the former (comprising twenty sherds) from Period I. About half of the rim, neck, shoulder and side of this jar is present, but there is no piece of base. The lower part of our reconstruction drawing is, therefore, conjectural, but cannot be seriously inaccurate. Original height, 17 cm. approximately; overall rim diameter, 15 cm. ; maximum diameter at shoulder, 18-3 cm. ; base diameter, 8 cm. approximately. Thickness of wall between rim and shoulder, 5 mm. increasing to 8 mm. at the lowest surviving part of the side. Strong finger corrugations on the inside, as well as minute horizontal striae outside, indicate clearly that the pot is wheel-made. A fine clay has been used and to it fine quartzite grits have been plentifully added as well as a very fine sand. The very small particles of the latter vary in colour from almost white through yellow and brown to black. No red particles of crushed pottery111 can be seen. The firing was well done at a high temperature, so that the ware is the same colour through from one surface to the other. The whole of the inside and the outside from the shoulder to and including the rim are of a dirty white colour in general, but there are some areas of pinkish brown. From the shoulder to the base externally, colour varies from light- above to very dark-grey below, but this appears to be due to the use of the pot for cooking over a fire, for the 110 Following the classification of Thomas?see Medieval Archeology, III (1959), 89-111. 111 cf. Thomas: op. cit., p. 96.</page><page sequence="90">io6 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy lower part of the side is heavily sooted. The external surface (the inner surface to a lesser extent) has a sandpaper-like feel due to the fact that the tips of the grits stand a little proud of the general surface. Whether this is due to the finishing technique used by the potter, or to an effect of the method of firing or merely to weathering of the sherds in the soil is not known for certain. No. 309, an E i jar (not illustrated), is represented by eight sherds found in a restricted area in the north-east quadrant of the enclosure and numbered 270, 274, 275 and 309 on the excavation. All are from Period I and as most of them can be joined together they obviously belong to a single pot of which about one-fifth of the side and shoulder is present. There is no sherd of rim or base. Thickness of side varies from 4 mm. at the top of the shoulder to 7 mm. at the lowest surviving part of the side. It would make up to a pot similar in size, shape, texture, colour and general appearance to no. 99 above, but its internal finger corrugations and external striae are so different that it cannot be a part of no. 99 and it is, therefore, treated as a pot in its own right. The external surface is sooted as in no. 99. Quartzite and sand grits but no red specks. No. 276 (fig. 23), an E i jar, is represented by seven sherds found widely scattered and numbered on the excavation 151, 276, 301, 355, 404, 405. Not all of them fit together so it is not possible to be certain that they all belong to the one pot, but on the basis of texture and general quality it seems very probable that they do. No. 276, comprising one sherd, is from Period II, while the remainder, comprising six sherds, is from Period I. Thomas112 has classified no. 276 as an E ii beaker, but it is clearly part of the base of an E i jar which has an external diameter of 12 cm. at a height of 2*5 cm. above the base. This is greater than the maximum diameter of the E ii pots from Garryduff, but would come very close to the external diameter of no. 99 taken at the same height. The ware in this vessel has a smoother surface texture inside and out than that of no. 99 and the outer surface is inclined to flake off in thin laminae in some sherds. In all except one of the sherds (no. 404) the external colour is a very dark grey brown or almost black and this penetrates half-way through the thickness of the wall, while the inside (which has marked finger corrugations) varies from buff to pink. Sherd no. 404 has a pinkish colour on both faces and in the core and it joins perfectly to sherd no. 405 which is almost black outside (not a coating of soot), grey in the core and pinkish-white inside ! If these two sherds did not fit together they could be taken as representing two different vessels. Fewer quartzite and sand grits. No red specks. No. 269, an E i jar (not illustrated), is represented by five sherds found widely scattered in the north-east quadrant of the enclosure and in the ditch at the north side of the entrance; they were numbered 269, 273, 332 on the excavation. Group no. 269 comprises three sherds from Period I and 273 and 332 one each from Period II. The three Period I sherds came from an undisturbed area, hence, the attribution of the lot to the first phase of occupation of the site. The sherds are from the side of a thin-walled pot (maximum thickness 4 to 5 mm.) 111 op. cit., p. 109.</page><page sequence="91">O'Kell Y?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 107 which should equal no. 99 above in size and form. The surfaces have the " sand paper " feel noted already and the insides are strongly finger corrugated. Grits of quartzite and very fine sand. No red specks. Colour of four sherds is a dirty bu? through and through; the fifth is very dark grey outside and for half-way through the body, and mottled grey and dirty buff inside. No. 33, an E i jar (not illustrated), is represented by four rather peculiar sherds numbered 33, 68 and 409 on the excavation and found widely scattered in the lower level of occupation in the enclosure and the bottom of the ditch at the north side of the entrance. All are attributable to Period I. These sherds are thin, 3 to 4-5 mm., and all have the same colour, feel and general appearance and are well fired. The colour is pink, varying to buff inside and grey-pink varying to almost black outside. Grits are quartzite, fine sand, white chalky specks and a very few red specks. The surfaces are smoother than those already described and there is no finger corrugation, but fine horizontal striations are visible inside and out. The most peculiar feature of the sherds is that they are dented, the pot having become misshapen before firing and while the clay was still soft. The ware is so similar in character to no. 83 (see below) that, even though it is peculiar, we feel reasonably sure that it should be considered an E i jar. It is curious, though, that such a poor product, undoubtedly a " second " should have been exported from its continental homeland to a territory so far away. But this is not the only example of a " second " from the south of Ireland?there is a thin red sherd from Ballycatteen118 which was said by the excavators to be an inexpert hand-made local copy. It is quite definitely wheel-thrown and an import into Ireland, like the rest of the southern material. No. 306, an E ii beaker (fig. 23), is represented by three sherds, all from Period I. One sherd (no. 32) came from the south-west quadrant of the interior, one (no. 306) from the entrance area, and one (no. 405) from the bottom of the ditch at the north side of the entrance. All are rim fragments and fit together to give approximately half of the rim and neck of the vessel. It is listed by Thomas114 under the number 306. As our illustration shows, this rim-form falls within the normal variation of the E ii beaker type, though its rim diameter at 10 cm. (4 inches) is perhaps slightly larger than the average. The diameter at the carination at the base of the neck must have been about 9*8 cm. Here the frac tured surface clearly indicates the characteristic sudden narrowing which took place in the lower part of the pot. Height of neck from carination to rim is 3*6 cm. Finger corrugation, though light, is clearly noticeable on the inner surface. These three sherds which fit together are quite different in feel and appearance and if they did not join accurately as they do, they would surely be considered representatives of three different vessels ! It is clear that the differences are adventitious and that they developed after the vessel had been broken and its fragments scattered. No. 306 is a very dark brownish-grey on all surfaces, even 118 ? R?ord?in and Hartnett: P.R.I.A., XLIX, C (1943), fig. 12, no. 21. See also ?

The grits are quartzite and fine sand (no red specks) and do not come through the surface so that this sherd has not got the sand-paper feel. Sherd no. 32 is a very light grey outside and in the core and is almost white on the inside. Its grits do protrude through the surfaces and the sand-paper feel is marked. It seems clear, therefore, that the gritty surface in this case, and probably in the E-ware in general, is due to weathering of the sherds and not to a potting or firing technique. The third sherd (no. 405) is a brownish cream colour throughout and its surface feel is intermediate between that of sherds 306 and 32. The three sherds, therefore, are differently weathered and, as a consequence, are so different in appearance and feel that they could be treated as coming from different vessels were it not that they join together to form the rim of a single beaker. No. 163,115 an E ii beaker (fig. 23), is represented by two large sherds which join together to provide more than half of the vessel. No sherd of the rim sur vives. One of the sherds was found by the landowner, Mr. O'Mahony, when he dug a trial hole in the south-west quadrant of the interior several years before our excavation. The other fragment was found by us in the same area on the old ground level and so we attribute the beaker to Period I. It is wheel-made (finger corrugations inside, striae outside, string cut-off base) from a clay gritted with quartzite and sand, but there are no red specks. Base diameter, 4 cm. ; shoulder diameter, 10 cm. ; maximum vertical height of surviving part, 5 cm. ; thickness of wall above shoulder, 4 mm. and of base, 5 mm. External and internal colour is very dark grey almost black in the lower part, shading off to a dirty, pinkish light-grey near the shoulder. The core is very dark grey, almost black. The two sherds of this pot are differently weathered, though not markedly so, but they provide further evidence that it is very necessary to make full allowance for adventitious differences. PERIOD II No. 456, an E i jar (fig. 23), of which two fragments of rim only survive. These were found above the collapse of the bank ends in the area of the entrance and are, therefore, attributable to Period II. Enough of the rim and neck area of it survives to show that this was an E i jar, a little smaller in size than no. 99 above. Rim diameter, 13*5 cm. ; thickness of ware, 4 mm. Colour is a dirty white through and through, and grits are quartzite and sand. No red specks. Here again the two sherds are differently weathered. The grits are thrusting through the surfaces markedly in one sherd which thus has a strong sand-paper feel, while the second sherd, which joins to the first, is much smoother on both surfaces. No. 83, an E i jar (fig. 23), is represented by eleven sherds in four groups numbered 83,172, 311 and 452 on the excavation. Eight sherds were found in a small area in the upper level of the north-east quadrant of the enclosure ; one 114 Thomas: op. cit., Appendix, p. 109, no. 163.</page><page sequence="93">O'Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 109 sherd (172) came from the old ground level below a pavement in the same area; one from the refuse in the ditch and one from the upper level in the south-east quadrant. Thus, since the majority have come from the upper level, the pot is attributed to Period II. Seven of these sherds can be joined together accurately. Before this was done the sherds, being thin (4 mm.) and of a deep pink, almost red colour inside, appeared as if they might belong to some type of vessel not yet clearly isolated or to a vessel of mixed origin. But when fitted together enough of the neck and shoulder became available to show beyond all doubt that this is an E i j ar of normal size (external diameter at shoulder, 15-6 cm.) though the ware is thin and redder than any of the comparable pots from the site except no. 33 above; it will be remembered that this had a peculiarly misshapen form. At the top edge of the assembled group of sherds (see fig. 23, no. 83) a small length of finger groove appears on the external face. Before assembly of the sherds this also appeared to be an anomalous feature, but now it can be seen to be either an irregularity below the rim or a deliberately made groove such as is to be seen on an E i jar from Ballinderry II.116 External colour in the lower part is brownish-grey, shading off to deep pink, almost red, at the top. Grits are quartzite and sand; no red specks. Finger corrugations clearly visible inside, but they are light. No. 401, an E i jar (fig. 23), is represented by six sherds, including a large piece of rim, side fragments and two pieces of base. Not enough of the side survives, however, to enable a reliable reconstruction of height to be made. These sherds were found beside the stone-lined upper-level hearth in the north-west quadrant and are attributable to Period II. Rim diameter can be accurately calculated at 17 cm., making this the largest of the reconstructable E i jars from the site. The rim section is of special interest because it clearly displays a lid groove on its inner aspect and the sherds are remarkable, too, in that they are only 3 mm. thick at shoulder height and 4 mm. in the fiat base (fig. 23, no. 401). Colour through and through in the upper part is a dirty pinkish white but in the base there are grey-white surfaces with a black core which seems to indicate that firing of the lower part of the vessel was not good. Grits are quartzite and sand and there are a very few minute red specks. No. 310 is a small fragment of the base of an E i jar (fig. 23) found just below the turf over the ditch at the north side of the entrance and therefore attributable to Period II. Almost black external surface, dark grey in the core and dirty white on the inner surface. Grits are quartzite and sand, but no red specks. Not enough survives to enable a reliable reconstruction of base diameter to be made. No. 385 (fig. 23) is a small fragment of the base of an E i jar found in the upper level of habitation refuse where this overlay the inward collapse of the bank in the north-west quadrant of the enclosure. The colour is a warm brown through and through and though the gritting in the core is normal (no red specks), the surfaces are smooth. Quality is poor and firing bad?the surfaces are crazed with many small hair cracks. Not enough survives to enable a reliable reconstruction of base diameter to be made.

H</page><page sequence="94">no Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy No, 271 (fig. 23), an E ii beaker, represented by an almost complete base found in the north-east quadrant of the enclosure in the upper habitation layer where this ran over the inward collapse of the bank. It is, therefore, attributable to Period II. The ware in this vessel is of very poor quality and while both surfaces have flaked off, it is nevertheless clear that it was wheel-made. Colour is a dirty pink throughout and gritting is in quartzite and sand with a few red particles which seem to be crushed pottery. A high percentage of the quartzite grits are large, one visible pebble being 1 cm. long. External base diameter can be measured at 4 cm., the same as that of the largely complete example, no. 163 above. No. 450 (fig. 23) is an E ii beaker represented by three sherds, two?nos. 450 and 451?found in the upper level of the south-east quadrant of the enclosure, and one (no. 163a) found with no. 163 (the almost whole beaker?see above) in the lower level of the south-west quadrant. On the basis of the two upper-level sherds the pot is attributed to Period II. All the sherds join together so that there is no doubt that only one vessel is in question. As can be seen from our drawing, it had a rather similar profile to that of no. 306 (see above), but is slightly larger in diameter at 11*5 cm. at the top of the rim. Height from shoulder to top of rim, 3*3 cm. The character of the ware varies from sherd to sherd. No. 450 is a dirty brown in colour and softer than no. 163a; no. 451 is intermediate in quality between the two, so that again we have evidence of differential weathering since the vessel was broken. The colour oi451 approximates to that of 450, but no. 163a is a pinkish-cream above the shoulder, becoming a very dark grey through and through below. Gritting is normal?quartzite and sand with no red specks. Thickness of rim, 4 mm. and below shoulder, 3 mm. No. Ill (not illustrated) is an E ii beaker represented by one large fragment of the side running from the shoulder almost to the base. Found in the upper habitation layer in the south-west quadrant and attributable to Period II. The colour, quality, feel and profile are very similar to those of no. 163 above, but the sherd clearly does not belong to that vessel. Thickness of side varying from 4 mm. at the shoulder to 7 mm. near the base. Not enough survives to enable reliable heights or diameters to be reconstructed but our impression is that the size was close to that of no. 163. No. 79 (fig. 23), a G-ware bowl, represented by one sherd found on an upper level pavement in the southern part of the enclosure. It is, therefore, attributable to Period II. The sherd is from the rim and side of the vessel and is different, both in profile and ware, from everything else on the site. All edges of the sherd are rounded off as if it had been water-rolled or used for drawing as with a piece of chalk. Colour is red, the paste is fine, quite gritless and soft enough to be used for chalking. On the external surface in the sheltered area at the junction of the rim and side there is definite evidence of a slightly darker red slip or wash showing a slight burnish. This has obviously been flaked or worn off the rest of the sherd. Were it not for the peculiar profile, it could be argued that this is A i or A\ii of the Garranes type117 or, indeed, that it is an heirloom survivor from a Samian vessel 117 ?

Cork in or that it is some sort of pesudo-Samian ware, all of which suggestions have been made to us by various colleagues in the course of discussion of the piece. It seems to fit best, however, in the " late colour coated " group G of Thomas* classification. Because of the worn condition of the sherd great accuracy in the reconstruction of the diameter of the edge of the rim is not possible, but this measurement was not less than 35 cm. (about 14 inches). Height of the vessel cannot be reconstructed but it seems likely that it was a rather shallow bowl. Nos. 342 and 410 (fig. 23) are dealt with together here, though they were found at widely-separated points on the site, no. 342 just under the turf over the ditch outside the north side of the entrance, no. 410 under the turf over the bank in the north-west quadrant. No. 342 is a thin strap handle, 410 a base sherd. Coming as they do from different parts of the site and from opposite ends of the vessel, it may seem strange that we have associated them at all. This has been done on account of the similarities in the ware. Firstly, both appear to be poorly fired and of a rather soft quality. Gritting is of quartzite and sand and in this characteristic the sherds can be likened to the E-ware material in general. Colour in the base sherd is a dirty pink inside and a mottled grey and pink outside and there is a blue core. The strap handle is a mottled pink (almost red) and blue-grey, both on its surfaces and in its core, but the grits protrude so much on all surfaces that it is clear that the sherd is heavily weathered. Examination under the microscope has revealed what appear to be minute traces of a green glaze adhering to the tips of a very few of the protruding grits, but this can be seen nowhere else in the piece. The base sherd shows clear evidence in small areas on the external surface of a light green glaze. Did both of these sherds have an all-over green glaze originally which is now weathered down to these slight traces ? Obviously one cannot give a positive answer one way or another to this question. The likelihood seems to be that this was a glazed jug or pitcher of post-Norman date, but one cannot absolutely exclude the possibility that the traces of glaze are due to accidental vitrification of the surface during firing and if this view were pressed, one might argue that here we have evidence of an E iv pitcher. Against this, however, must be set the following points. The vertical and horizontal profiles of the handle do not compare closely with those of the known E iv handles?the vertical curve is too straight and there is only one longitudinal groove on the outward aspect instead of the more usual two.118 The base sherd exhibits a slight external foot, a feature not seen in any of the E-ware vessels at Garryduff. On balance, therefore, it would seem wiser to regard these two sherds as representatives of a post-Norman glazed vessel dropped on the surface long after the original period of occupation, as was obviously the late silver coin described below. Overall length of handle, 7-5 cm. ; width and thickness at mid-point, 2*5 cm. and 1-4 cm., respectively. Thickness of base sherd, 3 mm. and of highest surviving point of side, 5 mm.

It was found in the south-west quadrant of the enclosure below the turf at the top of the upper level of habitation refuse, a position into which it could readily have sunk in the course of time. It was crudely perforated for suspension and the edges of the ^roughly-punched hole show some wear and rubbing down. One face bears the crowned head looking left surrounded by the inscription ". . . Scot Ang * Fr &amp; * Hib." The first element is illegible. Behind the king's head is XX signifying the value. The other face bears the thistle surmounted by a crown surrounded by the legend "... Thronum * Firmat." The first element is again illegible. SUMMARY This ring-fort was first brought to attention when Mr. W. O'Mahony, the landowner, presented to the Museum at University College, Cork, some objects which he had found when his interest in the site led him to dig a few small trial holes in its interior. The objects themselves, sherds of post-Roman pottery, glass beads, etc., as well as his accurate description of the nature of the soil he had encountered, indicated that the structure was worthy of further investigation and this work was subsequently undertaken with his ready permission and full co-operation. The ring-fort stands on the highest point of a knoll at 531' O.D., and occupies a commanding position overlooking an extensive area of good agricultural land. It has the highest siting of the five ring-forts in the townland, but with an internal diameter of 66 feet, it is by far the smallest of this group of structures. If its siting was determined in the first instance by military considera tions the finds give little evidence of warlike activity. On the contrary, they seem to show that its occupants were a sedentary, peace-loving people, interested in trade and in the arts and crafts of the time. Th? appearance of the site with its deceptively rounded profiles led us to suppose that it was an earth-work, but the first section cut through the bank on the south revealed well-built inner and outer stone facings with, between them, a filling of broken rock quarried from the external fosse or ditch. The quality of the building work was excellent. For most of the construction sandstone boulders were used, but for some runs of the inner facing, flat pieces of quarried shale were utilized. This imposing bank had been built upon a foundation consisting of an annular platform of broken rock quarried from the ditch and thrown -up around the highest point of the knoll so as to provide an approxi mately level site for the fort. Complete excavation of the interior revealed the rather irregular shape of the enclosed space, which was neither oval nor circular (maximum diameter, 66 feet) and to which access was gained by an asymmetrically placed entrance. Though the stone facings of the bank were largely collapsed in the entrance area,</page><page sequence="97">O'Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 113 it was possible to determine the lines to which they had been built and here again asymmetry is marked, not only in the plan but also in the thickness of the bank ends. The outer end of the entrance passage was narrowed by erecting a stout post against each jamb. Presumably, a wooden gate closed against these, its base resting upon or against a wooden threshold set in a trench across the passage. Short lateral palisades connected the gate-posts to two other posts set just outside the external corners of the entrance jamb. It is possible to interpret this arrangement of four posts joined in pairs by the lateral palisades as the base of a gate-tower. The entrance was approached from the east over an uncut causeway lying between the ends of the rock-cut ditch. The latter, though broad (about 17 feet at the top), varied in depth from 6 feet on the north side of the entrance to about 4 feet on the north, west and south sides, while it was only Y 6" deep on the south side of the entrance causeway. Quarrying of the ditch had been done with picks, the marks of the points of which could be seen in the rock itself in several places and in chips of broken rock in the bank fillings in all the sections through the defences. No evidence of the nature of these picks was found. The deeply-cut part of the ditch on the north of the entrance was used from the first as a rubbish dump and many important finds came from this deposit. Two periods of habitation were indicated within the enclosure by black layers of refuse which were clearly separated from one another near the bank, but elsewhere were not so easy to distinguish. Two wooden houses occupied the whole of the central area of the enclosure in Period I and it is likely that at least parts of these structures continued to stand above ground when Period II began. The end of Period I was marked by a collapse of the upper part of the bank as well as by the decay or destruction of the entrance and its defences. When the enclosure was occupied for the second time habitation took place on top of this collapse, spreading up on to the core of the bank and over the ruins of the entrance. In the south and west a shelter wall was built on the bank, but the line of this was not co-incident with the original inner face (pi. Ill, XYZ) and there was no attempt made to re-build the entrance. The occupants at this time evidently had no need of a defensive structure. Isolated areas of pavement, as well as a number of hearths, probably represent the floors Of houses built during Period II. It proved impossible to recover the plans of these structures because of the difficulty of finding post-holes in the soft black habitation layer, and the underlying collapse of the bank?stones from the facing and a great quantity of rock chips from the core?was also a difficult material to work in. Small objects were found in every part of the enclosure, as well as in the rubbish dump in the ditch at the north side of the entrance and as will have been seen in the catalogue above, many of them are of considerable interest. Through out the excavation a careful record was kept of the habitation layer from which each object came, but at the end it could be seen that there was no very significant difference between the material from Period I and that from Period II. The presence of a number of furnaces used for iron-smelting and other purposes, crucibles, blobs of glass and stone trial-pieces, show that the com</page><page sequence="98">ii4 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy munity included amongst their number artist-craftsmen of considerable capabil ity, as well as farmers and huntsmen, for the few querns imply cereal cultivation, while the animal bones included those of ox, pig, small horse or pony, sheep and red-deer. No doubt wild fruits were also availed of and the quantities of the shells of hazel nuts found around the hearths are some evidence of this collecting activity, DISCUSSION As the general plan of the site shows the ditch was comparatively well laid out to a circular plan. Why was not this same care applied in the laying out of a circular line for the inner face of the bank ? This can hardly have been due to ineptitude on the part of the builders for, where the inner facing had remained undisturbed, the quality of the masonry was very good indeed. When the levelling of the site had been accomplished the ditch-excavators continued to throw up from outside the material they were quarrying and presumably, this rubble spread irregularly inward. To build a circular internal face, the inward tail should have been cut back, but evidently this was not done. Most of the facing was built with collected sandstone boulders, but when the supply of these ran out use was made of the larger pieces of shale already quarried and lying about the site. The masons were as expert in using the latter as they were in building with the sandstone boulders. The use of these different materials does not necessarily imply repair or rebuilding of the facing, but it may mean that two groups of men were engaged and possibly that the work was being done in a hurry. The very curious junction found at the point D (pis. Ill, V, b, VI, a) on the western side of the enclosure is difficult to account for otherwise. We have rernarked above that the amount of rubble thrown up from the ditch was greatest on the west side, so that here there would have been a greater inward spread of the loose material. To build to a circular line on this side would, therefore, have entailed a greater amount of cutting back, which again does not appear to have been sufficiently done. If two groups of builders were working towards each other from the north and south?perhaps in a hurry?it is conceiv able that the lines to which they were working would not meet accurately and hence the botched overlapping joint at D. On the other hand the inward pressure of the core of rock rubble on the south-west may have been such as to cause an almost immediate collapse of the face from C to D, necessitating a quick rebuilding. If the new inward slip of the core were not sufficiently cut back, the new face would have stood forward of the old line and this again could have resulted in the botched joint at D. However, as explained above, the primary habitation layer ran to the bases of CD and AD, but not under either. Hence, it would appear that the overlapping joint existed when inhabitation of the enclosure first began. Portion of the CD face was taken down to investigate behind it, but nothing was found which would enable us to offer better explana tions of the peculiarities encountered than those we have given.</page><page sequence="99">O'Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 115 We have seen that the wooden structure at the entrance can also be inter preted as a gate-tower, from the upper storey of which the occupants of the fort could have conducted a good defence in time of attack, but as we have no evidence as to the height of the posts or palisades and little evidence of such entrance structures on other Irish sites, we would not press this interpretation. On the other hand, some of the finds indicate contacts with the post-Roman world and the inspiration for a defensive tower might well have come from the same source. But by and large, there was little indication of war-like activity? the two small iron spear-heads are hardly to be taken as evidence that the fort was set up as a military post and the rest of the finds indicate that much time was devoted to craft work of various kinds. The inhabitants of the site in both periods must have been people of some consequence for they were able to afford many ornaments of different kinds and, even if some of these were manufactured on the site, the raw materials for them had to be obtained from somewhere. The iron ore used was available locally, but where did the bronze (or the copper and tin from which to make it) come from and the ingredients for glass if it was made on the site ? Either the occupants were themselves traders and travellers or they were sufficiently important or well known to attract the attention of travelling salesmen. Do the fragments of glass vessels indicate that such were in use in the fort, or were the sherds imported as scrap to be re-used ?119 It will be remembered that one piece (no. 609 above) had been heated and marked with a knife while soft. In either event the presence of the sherds means trade either with the adjacent European mainland or with Egypt and the East,120 the European mainland being perhaps the more likely since the imported cooking pottery probably also came from this source.121 These goods may well have entered the area via Cork Harbour, the eastern neck of which runs up to Ballinacurra near Midleton, nine miles to the south of the fort. What was the length of the occupation of the site and has our division of the material into two periods any real significance ? It must be accepted that there were two habitation layers clearly separated from one another by a partial but nevertheless appreciable collapse of the upper part of the enclosing bank. What can have been the cause of the collapse ? If it was due to natural causes, either there was a sudden cataclysm or there was a period of abandonment during which the normal slow processes of decay were at work. If we suppose that the fort was attacked, surely such an attack would have been concentrated on the entrance area where the wooden features were vulnerable to fire-setters ? But no evidence of destruction by fire was found, either at the entrance or anywhere in the interior. If attackers scaled the bank and gained access that way, would they then have set to work to dismantle the entrance, tear down the bank and pull the facing and rubble core into the interior? This does not seem likely. If they did this surely the primary occupants were now all dead or banished and who then re-occupied the site almost immediately, using the same kinds of 119 See Harden: Dark Age Britain (1956), pp. 151, 154. 120 See Radford: Dark Age Britain (1956), p. 64 and Harden, ibid., p. 151. 121 cf, Thomas: Medieval Archeology, III (1959), 96.</page><page sequence="100">ii6 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy goods, both native and exotic ? If battle was in the air why was there no attempt at re-fortification by the Period II occupants ? Except for the building of the XYZ wall, which was probably thrown up as a shelter against the wind, they seem to have been satisfied with the site as it was. They set their houses upon the inward collapse of the bank and they squatted over the ruined entrance and carried on their crafts of iron-smelting, etc., as before. Obviously, the imponderables here render it-impossible to arrive at any firm conclusion ! But if we consider the group of; bronze pins it is clear that the same types were in use during both periods^-no detectable change in form took place between one period and the next. Better still is the evidence of an expendable material such as the pottery. In all there were about seventeen vessels?no more than might have been purchased on a single occasion from one visiting pedlar?and the very fragility of the pots means that they cannot have survived in use for long under the conditions of life obtaining on such a site. As we have seen, fragments which fit together and therefore belong to the same pot have come from both levels. While this can, in part at any rate, be due to the disturbance of the Period I stratum by the Period II occupants (and it must be accepted that such disturbance is bound to have occurred in the digging of post-holes and pits and in the scooping out of furnace-pits and so on), it cannot explain every instance and hence we think it reasonable to conclude that however the collapse of the bank is to be explained, the interval between the primary and secondary occupa tions was of negligible duration. If this assumption m correct, Garryduff I is for all practical purposes, a single period site. There is, of course, no sure way of determining the length of this single period in the absence of literary references, but need we assume that it was of longer duration than two or three generations ? We must now turn to the problem of the date of the occupation and in dealing with this matter the three most significant groups of objects would seem to be the bronze pins, the pottery and the trial pieces. In our figure 2 we illustrate four ring-pins of a well-known form, with faceted heads and loose rings of " key-ring " type (nos. 123, 360, 489, 491) and there are remains of others from the site. They have come from Periods I and II. Armstrong122 figured some similar pins and dated them to the early sixth century. Lagore crannog123 produced a number of examples and one of them came from Period I of that site a position which would give a seventh-century dating? probably early in the century. Two others were found at Carraig Aille,124 a site dated in the published report to the eighth-tenth century. More recently one was found at the Letterkeen ring-fort in Co. Mayo125 and in discussing it the excavators discounted the late evidence at Carraig Aille II and accepted " a fairly early date for the Letterkeen ring-pin?probably about the seventh century." Mrs. Alison Young suggested a seventh-eighth century date for a comparable Scottish pin.126 It would appear then that there is a consensus of opinion which 122 Archmologia, LXXII (1921-22), 75 and pi.

Cork my favours a seventh-century date for these pins and it is well to remember, though the evidence is negative, that the type did not occur at Garranes whose central datecof about 500 has received a wide measure of acceptance. Thus, if we were to date Garryduff on the basis of these ring-pins alone we should suggest that the occupation did not begin before the seventh century. Comparison of our pin no. 375 (fig. 2) with pin no. 651 from Ballinderry II127 hardly alters the position despite the revised dating of the foundation of that site to 500-600.128 The pottery from Garryduff (fig. 23) belongs entirely to the E-ware class as defined by Thomas129 except for one sherd of red ware, which he would place with his late colour-coated class G material130 ; and we would agree with him in this ascription. Red wares of the A-group and amphor of the B-group of eastern Mediterranean origin, such as were found at Garranes, are very definitely absent. Even if the single red sherd could be placed in the A category on the basis of fabric, its form is wrong for this group (fig. 23, no. 79) and in any case its very worn condition would demand that it be considered an heirloom. If Thomas131 is right that the A- and B-wares are early, their absence from Garryduff suggests that our ring-fort is later than those sites where they do occur. On this basis Garryduff is later than Garranes (central date 500), but could be contemporary with Ballycatteen (central date 600) where also the A- and B-wares were absent. Thomas' maps132 clearly show that the A- and B-wares have, on present evidence, an undeniably southern distribution, while the G- and E-wares travel much further to the north. This distributional picture, as well as his stratigraphical succession at Gwithian133 lead him to propose that sites which do not have the A- and B-wares are later than those which do, even though the E-ware is already present with A and B on the early sites. If, as is supposed, the A-B wares came from the eastern Mediterranean and the E-G wares from the Rhineland,134 it is unlikely that the two types travelled together or that they were peddled by the same entrepreneur. Does the absence of A- and B-ware from Garryduff and Ballycatteen necessarily mean then any more than that a Mediterranean salesman found his way to Garranes, but did not know of or bother to go to the other two southern sites ? This is unlikely. According to Thomas,135 B-ware continued to be imported in the sixth century?A-ware less certainly?but he has found it difficult "to show any clear case of their importation in the seventh/'136 The E-ware, on the other hand, continued to reach sites in the north of Ireland and in Scotland " which are certainly seventh-, if not early eighth-century in date/'137 127 Hencken: P.R.I.A., XLVII, C (1942), fig. 18. 123 Hencken: P.R.I.A., LIU, C (1950), 18. 129 Medieval Archeology, III (1959), 89-111. 130 ibid., p. 110. 131 ibid., p: 101. 132 Thomas: Medieval Archeology, III (1959), pp. 102, 103.

The trial pieces from Period II are of especial interest not only because of their intrinsic nierit, but also because they include designs which we can see in perfected form in some of our well-known works of art and though the number of pieces is small, they include instances of the basic elements found in much of the Early Christian art of these islands. There is a spiral pattern, there are geometrical line interlacements, there is an animal or bird ornament and there is an interlaced anthropomorph. It can scarcely be denied that though these designs are experimental and unfinished, and in some instances carelessly executed, the man who drew them was an artist of high calibre fit to take his place in one class with the artists of the Tara Brooch and the Book of Kells. All of the patterns have been dealt with in detail above, but we must now look again at two of them. If we consider the bird- or animal-head of trial piece no. 370 (pi. XI, 370; fig. 16, no. 370) we shall see that the principal details of it?the eye treatment with rear loop, the S-curve beginning over the eye and ending in a spiral and the backward curl of the tip of the upper half of the beak?are closely paralleled in the animal-heads on the periphery of the Tara Brooch, an object which is generally considered to be of early eighth-century date.138 The same heads with gaping mouths and re-curved ends to the upper jaw are to be seen on the Moy lough belt shrine and on other metal objects of the eighth century. By far the most interesting of the trial pieces, however, is no. 434 (pi. X ; fig. 15, no. 434), the interlaced anthropomorph. This design is set out on a geometrical basis, first by sub-dividing the main panel by drawing the axis lines, then by compass prickings and finally, by using the compass or dividers to draw actual circles at nodal points in the design?technical tricks now well known in the lay-out of manuscript patterns, as for instance, those in the Book of Lindis farne.?139 But where do we find the closest parallels for various details of the human figures interlaced on the two panels on this stone ? Affinity with the Book of Kells is most marked for not only are pairs of interlaced men common in the MS (5R, 7V, 188R, 253V, etc.), but also several details of the Garryduff design are reproduced there almost exactly. The face profiles of Garryduff with the projecting forelock of hair above the forehead can be seen again and again in Kells where, of course, being drawn on vellum, delineation is better and more developed than the quickly scratched heads of the Garryduff stone. The profile at the top right-hand corner of 130R?the opening words of Mark?is particularly relevant, but see also 5R, 7 V, 32 V, 188R, 200R for a similar treatment of the hair. The same is true of the treatment of the hands and feet. The prick mark on the ankle in the Garryduff piece is paralleled by the red dot in the same position in Kells (7V) as is also the " mittened hand " outline (5R).140 The inference to be 138 Mahr: 730-740 A.D. in Christian Art in Ancient Ireland, II (1941), pp. 62, 63; Raftery :l 720-730 A.D. in ibid., p. 126; Henry: early eighth century, 'in Irish Art (London, 1940), p. 119. 139 Bruce-Mitford: Codex Lindisfarnensis (1960), pp. 109 and 221 f?. 140 I am indebted to Mr. G. F. Mitchell, Lecturer in Irish Archaeology, Trinity College, Dublin, for drawing my attention to these details. r</page><page sequence="103">O'Kell y?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 119 drawn here seems to be that these Garryduff trial pieces are of eighth-century date. It is well to remember here that they have come from Period II and there fore belong to a time late in the occupation of the site. What, then, of the gold bird ? This, as we have seen, came from the old turf and certainly belongs to the time of the building of the fort or to its earliest occupation. It is of interest to note that the excavation of the area which pro duced it had been completed and that the square had received what was to be its final cleaning when it was noticed that a little of the grey-purple old turf still remained. It was decided to remove this for the sake of completeness and, in doing so, the gold ornament was found ! There has been much discussion of it and various dates have been suggested. Admittedly, it was being considered in isolation since the rest of the material from the site was virtually unknown because of the delay in publication of the full report. Had the full range of material from the site been known and had there been available earlier the information on the post-Roman pottery in general which Mr. Thomas has recently given us, it is likely that there would have been no great divergence of views. Dr. Henry141 suggested the beginning of the sixth century, while Mr. Bruce-Mitford142 held that " The natural date for the Garryduff bird is the early eighth century/' We have seen above that a seventh- or seventh-eighth-century date for the occupation of the fort is very likely and the bird must come at the beginning of this period. Dr. Henry's dating should, therefore, come down somewhat and perhaps Mr. Bruce-Mitford would allow me to move his up a little. He will remember that in conversation I wrung 650 from him, but only as a hardly-won concession ! Dr. Haseloff, who has examined the bird more than once, has held (in conversation with us) that it is not earlier than 650. The twisted beaded wires which form the rope motif around the edge of the bird can be compared with the twisted filigree of the Lagore gold ornament which belonged to Period la of that site and " cannot be later than 651. "143 If, then, a date of this order could find acceptance, it would be permissible to place the occupation of the site within the century 650-750, but those who wish may extend the period to 800. Our animal- or bird-head (no. 370) would stand as a contemporary of the Tara Brooch, our knot-work with " hooked qr clubbed loops " (no. 345) could have been drawn while the Book of Lindisfarne was being decorated and our anthropomorph (no. 434) could be somewhat earlier than the Book of Kells. It is, of course, impossible to say whether the gold bird was made at Garry duff or whether it came from elsewhere, but even if it came from elsewhere it does not have to be an import into Ireland. Clearly the trial pieces belong in the fort for the stones used are undoubtedly of immediately local origin and we have seen that craft-work of many kinds was going on at the site. There is no reason to suppose that the bird could not have been made there and the same is true of 141 Dark Age Britain (1956), p. 76. 142 Medieval Archeology, II (1958), 215.

Here, then, in east Cork, in the south of Ireland, was a small secular site within which there lived a group of craftsmen who had all the knowledge, artistic ability and technical competence to enable them to produce, if they so wished, major works of art in various media and in the best traditions of the Irish Early Christian period. We need not, therefore, search in Northumbria or look to Lindisfarne for the headquarters of it all! GARRYDUFF II Garryduff II lies 180 yards down the slope to the north from Garryduff I at an elevation of about 465' O.D. Its interior is some 60' lower than that of site I. ,This difference in elevation, though comparatively slight, greatly reduces the view, so much so that it has anything but a commanding position. Being below the top of the knoll it is not only overlooked and dominated by Garry duff I, but is well sheltered from the south-west wind. In wild weather Garryduff I can be a cold place to live or work in, while under the same conditions the lower site is very much more pleasant.

Garryduff II?Sectional profiles</page><page sequence="105">O'Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 121 Even before excavation this was an impressive site. Its bank was high and had a steep external slope to the clearly visible ditch. When the coarse vegetation which covered it had been cleared away it was found to have smoothly rounded profiles with no stone-work anywhere in evidence, and were it not for our experience with site I, we would have assumed that it was an earth-work. The gently sloping internal face of the bank tailed off quickly and the enclosed area would have been quite fiat were it not for the slight general slope of the terrain to the east. The ring-fort was so near to site I (pi. XVIII, b) that it was thought well that it too should be investigated in the hope of determining the relation ship, if any, of one to the other. As will be seen, despite a fairly thorough and careful excavation, Garryduff II produced no find whatsoever and no trace of any internal construction. The site was laid out for excavation on the quadrant method (pi. XVII) and broad trenches divided into squares were cut along the north-south and east-west axes. These revealed that the depth of soil from the grass-level to the base of the old turf was a mere nine inches over all of the central area, a deeper deposit occur ring only in the vicinity of the bank where there was some inward collapse. Except for three charcoal spreads on the old turf surface and a pit cut through this horizon and filled with charcoal, the soil removed and the surface uncovered were found to be archaeologically sterile. This was rather surprising after the wealth of material that had come from site I. The remainder of the interior was then examined by means of an effective system of narrower trial trenches. While these enabled us to trace the old turf surface over the greater part of the enclosure, they brought absolutely nothing to light, either in the way of finds, post-holes or other features. We have seldom encountered such archaeologically sterile ground ! Our trial trenches did, however, enable us to establish that here again the ring-fort was stone-built and, as the plan shows, we traced the line of the inner facing on all sides of the enclosure (pi. XVII). The building was done mainly in slabs of shale obviously selected out of the material quarried from the ditch but there were some collected sandstone boulders. Except in the vicinity of the entrance, the mason's technique was very poor (pi. XVIII, a) and was in com plete contrast to the beauty of the work in Garryduff I. Everywhere the building looked as if it had been done by amateurs. Where best preserved the facing stood to a height 3' 6" but only at a few points had it remained vertical?the pressure of the core behind having caused it to lean inward almost everywhere and in several places it had collapsed down to the bottom course or two. This would seem to have happened because the building technique was bad and so many of the pieces of shale used were small, resulting in poor bonding both between the stones themselves and between the facing in general and the material of the core behind. Two sections were cut right through the bank (fig. 24), one at the east in the vicinity of the entrance, the other at the west, and both were continued outward through the ditch. Both showed the piling up of the turf inside the line of the ditch, a feature clearly visible in our illustration. There then followed the</page><page sequence="106">122 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy throwing up of the material dug and quarried from the broad flat-bottomed ditch. On the north side of the entrance there had quite certainly been an external stone facing for, as the general plan shows (pi. XVII), some stones of the bottom course of this1 remained in position, while the collapse of the upper part lay on the slope down to the ditch and practically filled the ditch itself (fig. 24). No stone of the outer facing remained in position on the south side of the entrance, but the ditch here was completely filled with boulders suitable for building. In the western section no outer facing-stone remained in position, but again large boulders were found in the ditch, though nothing like the same quantity as in the ditch ends on the eastern side. The modern fence on the west was largely built of stone and it is possible that this material was taken from the facing within the last 150 years or so (fig. 24). The southern run of the bank had been damaged in comparatively recent times on its external slope and no section was cut here or on the north. Therefore, while it is clear that there had been a built external facing in the vicinity of the entrance, it is not certain that this feature was continued all the way around, though there is some likelihood that it was. The core of the bank at both sides of the entrance was composed mainly of broken rock from the ditch, but mixed with it was a high proportion of fine yellow-brown powdery soil. On the west there was a still higher proportion of this material mixed with the broken rock and in both positions there was rather more of it than one would have thought could have come from the area of the ditch. The rock-chips and soil were a homogeneous mixture with no trace of a layered structure and since soil was not scraped off the enclosed area nor, appar</page><page sequence="107">O* Kelly?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 123 ently, from the area immediately outside the site, it would seem that the fine soil content was due to the breakdown of the shale chippings. The shale into which the ditch was cut was softer?more in the nature of mudstone?than it had been at the top of the knoll where Garryduff I stood. The core of the bank appeared to have been thrown up rapidly. Where the thickness of the bank could be measured accurately on the north side of the entrance, it was found to be 18' 6" broad at the base and it cannot have been much thinner elsewhere. Fig. 26. Garryduff II?conjectural reconstruction of entrance At each side of the entrance the ditch was 15' wide at the top, narrowing to a fiat bottom 8' wide, but these measurements at the west were slightly less. The depth of the ditch measured vertically from old ground level was 8' both at the east and west sides. At the east side the vertical height from the present bank top to the ditch bottom was 19' 6" and at the west 17'. When some allowance is made for denudation of the bank top it can be seen that this ring-fort was a formidable structure indeed. The space enclosed by these impressive defences was oval, the maximum internal diameters being 115' east-west and 95' north south. The site was, therefore, appreciably larger than Garryduff I, the maxi mum internal diameter of which was 66' (pis. I and XVII). The most interesting part of the structure was the entrance area, the arrangement here being quite unusual (fig. 25, pis. XIX, XX). The width of the uncut causeway between the ditch ends was 19' and this led to the entrance passage itself which was 16' wide between the stone-built parallel jamb-faces.</page><page sequence="108">124 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy When the stones that had collapsed from the upper parts of these faces were cleared a niche or rebate was found in the stone-work on each side and from these,1 palisade trenches ran outward towards each other at right angles to the jambs. The northern trench was 6' 6" long, 1' 6" wide and 3' 11" deep. The filling was a soft loose dark soil with some thin stone slabs standing here and there against the quite vertical sides. The southern trench was 7' 6" long, 1' 6" wide and 3' 4" deep. The filling here was of two kinds?very loose soft dark soil divided by cross-walls of yellow-brown earth similar to the surrounding soil but softer and looser. By taking out the dark soil first the trench was found to divide into three rectangular holes and one much smaller circular hole. In the bottom of the central large hole it was possible to see the imprint of the base of a squared 9" by 9" post. Impressions such as this did not remain in the other holes. It is, however, reasonable to assume that the remainder of the posts used in the palisades were squared timbers of a similar order of size. When they had been set in the trench not quite contiguously the yellow-brown soil originally dug from the trench was packed in around them, hence the cross-walls. The darker fill was due to inwash of soil as the bases of the posts rotted away. The ends of the palisades had been held in the masonry rebates and where they stood free had been supported from the inside by heavy props set in large, deep, skew-cut holes, 1' 6" in diameter and 1' 8" deep. Thus, they were held firmly against pressure from outside. The circular hole at the end of the southern palisade trench held a post 6" in diameter and perhaps a wooden gate was hung on this. The wooden construction narrowed the great opening in the bank to an effective width of 5'. Inside, the built facings of the bank curved away asymmetrically from the palisades. In fig. 26 we give a conjectural reconstruction DISCUSSION In the complete absence of finds the date of this ring-fort cannot be assessed and there is no means of telling whether it and Garryduff I were contemporary structures or not. The building technique in the stone facing was much inferior to that of site I and while this might be taken as an indication that the sites were built at different times by different people, this is not necessarily so. If, for instance, site II had been thrown up in an exceptional hurry the building tech nique would certainly have suffered, or if it had been intended for use as a defensive pen into which the domestic herd could be driven on occasion for protection, a rougher building technique might have been thought sufficient. There is no evidence that site II was ever occupied by humans since there was no domestic refuse anywhere in the enclosure or in the ditch-ends at the entrance. The few charcoal spreads found can have been due to fires lighted during the building of the fort. It is difficult to imagine that it was left totally unused when so much hard work had been put into building it, but either it was left unused or it was used for a purpose which left no recognizable evidence behind. This brings us back to the suggestion made earlier that it was built as a cattle enclosure. The lower, more sheltered site would have been of advantage in this</page><page sequence="109">O'Kell Y?Two Ring-forts at Garryduff, Co. Cork 125 case and, if it had been so used while Garryduff I was in occupation the cattle penned there would have been in full view of their owners during daylight at any rate. But if the sites were in contemporary use the one for human occupation, the other as a cattle-pen, it is strange that, in the ordinary comings and goings between the two, no objects from site I strayed into site II. But whether for humans or for cattle, why such a broad entrance ? Surely a narrower one with less timber in its construction would have been better from the point of view of defence, since the timber work would seem to invite attack by fire-setting ? No satisfactory answers can be given to these questions and speculations. The peculiarities of the site merely emphasize what is already obvious?that, as yet, we know far too little about the ring-fort as a type. This is a problem in Irish archaeology which is unlikely to be solved until a concerted attack can be made on these monuments as a whole. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS It is a pleasure to record here our thanks to Mr. William O'Mahony, the landowner, for bringing these sites to notice, for giving every facility for their excavation and for presenting the finds from Garryduff I to University College, Cork. They are now in the Cork Public Museum ; to our workmen : John, Thomas, Martin, Pierce and Kevin Hennessy, John Dineen and Patrick and John Leahy; to Mr. P. J. Hartnett, M.A., the late Mr. P. O'Shea and Mr. E. M. Fahy, M.A., for help on the site and to the latter for all drawings published herewith; to Mr. A. W. Stelfox for the report on the animal bones; to those who have discussed the finds with me and have offered comments and suggestions, and to those colleagues whose work has been referred to throughout the report ; to my wife for help on the site and in all subsequent stages of the investigation; to the Colbert family, Ballynoe, for much kindness and hospitality. The two seasons' work at Garryduff I were financed by grants from the Governing Body of University College, Cork, while the excavation of Garryduff II was covered by a State grant administered by the Special Employment Schemes Office and the Royal Irish Academy, Dublin. Other facilities were given by the Cork Public Museum. APPENDIX In the collection of bones from Garryduff, Co. Cork, the following animals were represented: ox, pig, sheep, small horse or pony, and red deer. Ox, both young and adult, was the predominant animal. There were no bones of the smaller mammals such as dog, cat, hare or badger, and no bird or fish bones. The absence of these bones is curious. As it is hardly due to dissolution in the soil it may reflect something of the habits of the people who lived there. A. W. Stelfox</page><page sequence="110">Proc. R.I.A., Vol. 63, Sect.
