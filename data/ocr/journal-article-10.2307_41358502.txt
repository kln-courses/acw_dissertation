<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY TWENTIETH ORDINARY MEETING Wednesday, 9TH April, 1930. Sir Daniel Hall, K.C.B., D.Sc., F.R.S., in the Chair. The Chairman said that the lecturer, who was to speak on " Genetical Methods of Livestock Improvement," was in charge of what he believed was the only institution in Great Britain which dealt with the breeding of the larger domestic animals, with genetics and the general theory of breeding and heredity. The following paper was then read : - GENETICAL METHODS OF LIVESTOCK IMPROVEMENT By Professor F. A. E. Crew, M.D., D.Sc., Ph.D. {Animal Breeding Research Department , University of Edinburgh ) During recent years the agricultural community has been asking ceaselessly for immediate help, for subsidies, for import duties and the like, but invariably the Governments have seemed to reply that such pleas are both mistaken and ungrateful, for is it not the case that the State has so endowed and organised agricultural research that the grandchildren of the present generation of agri- culturalists must so profit that in their time there will be no problems but only universal agricultural prosperity. But one is not surprised to find that the agriculturalists now living seem to exhibit but slight interest in the social circumstances of the generations yet unborn, or to learn that the remark of a former Minister of Agriculture, when addressing a branch of the National Farmers' Union to the effect that his Government was spending much money on research, evoked derisive laughter. It would seem at first sight that the agriculturalists are somewhat contemptuous of research. But really this is not so. They laugh, sometimes rather bitterly, because they cannot see how the research schemes organised by the State can possibly remove that which they regard as the root cause of the present calamitous conditions of agriculture, namely, the small or commonly non-existent margin between the cost of production and the price of the produce. They hold the</page><page sequence="2">73° JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS May l6, I930 view that nothing but the immediate increasing of this margin in favour of the producer can save the situation. It is for this reason that agriculturalists receive proposals which in their opinion can have no immediate effect on the producer's margin of profit with but scanty enthusiasm. It has to be recognised that never in all the history of agriculture in this country have the economics of breeding demanded more careful consideration than now ; that with the exception of the sheep alone, costs of production are high and returns are low ; that arable farming is largely being replaced by grazing in order to reduce losses ; that there is a distinct possibility that the sheep markets may become saturated ; that the change in the system of farming may prove to be regrettable from the national standpoint ; that the marketing of cereals will probably remain as unprofitable as it is at present and that the only sound policy for the British farmer would seem to be increased livestock production with the marketing of crops in the form of animal commodities, since, owing to the tastes of the British public, fresh animal products cannot, yet awhile at least, be affected by foreign competition. If, then, the aim of British agriculture is to be the production of standardised and uniform animal commodities, the time has come already for serious thought and action. But it is exceedingly difficult for the hard-pressed agriculturalist to plan for the future whilst the present is so very full of gloom. This being so, it becomes a matter of some difficulty for one who like myself knows full well that much time is required for the development and démocratisation of the results of successful scientific investigation to talk enthusiastically of the benefits conferred upon livestock breeding practice by the science of genetics to a company of men whose anxiety is so profound and whose position is presently so insecure. I must remove all possibilities of misunderstanding by defining my point of view concerning the relation of the professional biologist in the service of the State to those whom he is meant to serve. The scientist is concerned with the disclosure of facts - verifiable scientific facts - and with the search for principle : the practitioner of agriculture is concerned with the weaving of these facts into the warp and woof of agricultural policies. It is for the scientist to advance knowledge ; it is for the agriculturalist to transform knowledge into wise action. Time was when tradition bequeathed by one generation to another was sufficient to command success in livestock breeding, but discoveries in fields of knowledge seemingly quite remote from farming have made the breeder largely dependent upon information that cannot be acquired on the farm. Nowadays tradition must ever be reviewed and commonly discarded. Advances in our knowledge of the principles of breeding, which are the substance of the science of genetics, have been such that to-day the actual value of a particular system of breeding is to be assessed only by one versed in genetical science, and no breeder can afford r even if he would, to neglect developments in this science, for progress in the techniques of breeding would seem to be possible only through the disclosure of relevant knowledge through scientific investigation and through the démocratisa- tion of this knowledge. But livestock breeding is much more than an adventure</page><page sequence="3">May l6, I93O JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 73I in applied genetics. The breeder is primarily a manager of a very complicated business, and it is expected of him that he shall be able to construct his own policy of breeding, to check the costs of production against the prices that he is likely to receive and to organise the application of labour. He must, moreover,, be a man of live imagination, possessing the ability to anticipate trends of develop- ment and to be alive to the values of the contributions that science has made and is making and to the power that it is placing in his hands. It is far too commonly forgotten that science is of assistance to the breeder only if he knows already the primary business of farming. It can be of help only if he is competent to apply its generalisations to his own particular circumstances. Science can contribute nothing unless the breeder is at all times prepared to jettison the old and to accept the new, to regard no method or system as immutable. It must be understood that no particular method is good in itself, but only in relation to prevailing conditions of markets, climate, soil and so forth, and that the only real test of the value of a method or a policy in breeding is that it shall yield a profit to the breeder in the circumstances under which it is practised. It follows,, then, that much more than an understanding of genetical theory and an appreciation of genetical facts is demanded. The science cannot help the man who, through lack of vision or of money, cannot continually seek new methods and new policies,, who cannot change his practice when markets change : it cannot help those who keep store cattle so long that they cannot compete in the end with the more suitable class of beef that comes from the cheaper grazing grounds abroad, nor those who breed unsuitable sheep which yield large joints and an abundance of fat, those who sell the quickest growing sows and keep the slowest for further breeding, not knowing that the economical conversion of food into pig is an inherited character and that the quickest growers are the most economical feeders. The geneticist can help the breeder when the latter has stated his policy and has defined,, more or less exactly, what he wishes to produce. The geneticist can discuss the methods of production, but the reasons for production fall outside his field. The Standard of Excellence. A definition of what the breeder wishes to produce leads at once to the con- struction of standards of excellence and thus to serious difficulty. These standards are necessarily complex, because it is impossible to concentrate on one or two qualities, such as meat or milk or wool production, and to neglect the animal as a whole ; the ideal animal must live, thrive and reproduce in a particular environment as well as provide certain animal commodities. Type is meaningless without reference to habitat and destiny. Another difficulty that stands in the way of standard making is that too commonly the general economics of production are complex ; for example, the destiny of a mountain breed of sheep may be the production of ewes for crossing with rams of a larger lowland breed in order to produce the best kind of fat lamb. The standard of the mountain breed in a case such as this is applied only to the female, for the function of the male is to-</page><page sequence="4">732 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS May l6, I930 produce females, whilst that of the lowland breed pertains mainly to the ram. Moreover, standards quite commonly cannot be consistent, since it may be impossible to obtain in a single animal the full development of all the desired points of excellence. The standard for males and females may be quite different, so that one flock or herd or strain secures a reputation for producing males of excellent type, whilst its females are not nearly so good. A special example of this is encountered in the cockerel-producing and the pullet-producing strains of such a breed of fowl as the Dark Brahma. Standards present great difficulty in their statement because of their elusive nature. Excellence can as yet be defined only in the vaguest of terms, and all too commonly it does not refer to the realities of structure and function of the animal body, and its analysis in terms of inherited characters is quite impossible. Yet until excellence has been defined and measured, the science of genetics cannot offer much real assistance. Improve- ment implies an attempted nearer approach to the standard of the ideal. Obviously, therefore, before there can be intelligent attempts at improvement the standard must be defined and must be shown to be biologically and economically sound. But all too commonly the standards are set, not by the breeder, but by the buyer, who knows little, if anything, of breeding. For example, one hears a great deal to-day of the need for improvement of the fleece of the sheep, but the voice one hears is the voice of the manufacturer of textile goods, who apparently regards the sheep merely as a vehicle of a fleece out of which he is destined to manu- facture socks and semits at a reasonable profit to himself. But the breeder has quite different standards : to him the fleece is a protective covering for the lamb and for the sheep, contributing to the development of such qualities as hardiness - the fleece must be of such a kind as will help his sheep to thrive, for he has to consider fertility, milk yield, growth rate and fitness in relation to the particular system of husbandry and to the geological and climatic conditions of his farm. The sheepbreeder in this country knows that mutton can always command a fair and steady price in the regional markets, whereas the fluctuations in the price of any particular grade of wool are profound and most unsettling. He therefore regards mutton production as the more important aspect of husbandry and wool merely as a bye-product. Two sets of interests must be considered when drawing up the standard of the ideal, the breeder's and the textile manu- facturer's, but of the two the breeder's must remain the more important. From what has been said, it is seen that the ideal type is that which in virtue of its characterisation so harmonises with the conditions of husbandry that it achieves the fullest expression of its hereditary endowment and so fulfils adequately the destiny for which it was intended. Before any standard of excellence can be intelligently constructed there must be available exact information concerning the purposes for which the stock is to be bred and concerning the habitat in which it is to have its being. When this information has been given it becomes a fairly simple matter to define and to construct the type.</page><page sequence="5">May l6, I93O JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 733 The Breeding of the Ideal Type. Breeding is a synthetic operation, and before there can be intelligent controlled synthesis there must be analysis. One of the most urgent demands in animal breeding is the scientific analysis of excellence and a study of the interrelationships of the various characters which in their combination constitute the ideal and of the mode of their inheritance. The methods of improvement, through breeding, are simple and straightforward. Developments in genetical science have not changed them, but have merely refined them and have explained their success. A recognition of the broad fact that the majority of the component characters in any ideal type are dominant in the Mendelian sense and that the majority of undesirable characters are recessive enables us to understand many things ; for example, the facts that it is not to be expected that the progeny of a mating shall be of the desired standard unless the parents approach that standard ; that the greatest chance of obtaining an individual of excellence is provided when parents, excellent themselves, and related one to the other, are used ; that it is not uncommon for good parents to throw bad offspring ; that any culling must be carried out as a national scheme since the herd or flock is far too small a unit when uniformity of produce is sought ; and that inbreeding can give such diverse results since this system of mating is the quickest means of disclosing the hidden recessi ves. There is only one sure way of improving the livestock of a country, and that is by improving the stockbreeder. This can be done by improving his education and by offering rewards for ability. At the present time the shows are not such important agents in livestock improvement as they were in days gone by, for far too much importance is given to standards which have no relation to economic worthiness : the showyard is somewhat blind to commercial realities and tends to encourage grossly uneconomical systems of husbandry. To-day the prize is too commonly given to the man who exhibits the best fitted animal and not to the animal that is the nearest to the ideal economic type. The fact that pedigree as an instrument wherewith to assess worthiness is not enough is not clearly recognised, and the prize is too often given to the best looker and not to the best performer. The milk record, the bacon quality, the pulling power, the egg record, the fertility record must overshadow the preferences of prejudiced judges ; judgment must be impersonal and based on a record of performance, on productivity, on thriftiness and resistance to disease before the shows can play their proper rôle in livestock improvement schemes. The milk recording schemes, the pig testing station, the wool yield test, the dynamometer, the laying trial, the premium schemes, which include considerations of fertility ratio and of prepotency, these are instances of the tools wherewith the standards of to-morrow are being fashioned in accordance with genetical fact, these are the instruments which are contributing to the education of the stockbreeder and which are the means by which he may hope to gain adequate rewards for the exhibition of vision and ability.</page><page sequence="6">734 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS May l6, I930 That which the enlightened individual, Bakewell, the Booths, the Collings, Bates, Cruickshank, Duthie, Watson, McCombie, Price, Hewers, for example, did and which " the white heifer that travelled " and " the Durham ox " did to show what good stock is and how to get it led inevitably to the rise of agricultural societies, the herd and flock book societies, all of them organisations for the protection, the improvement and the advertisement of stock. But the time has come when that which the society cannot do, the State must. Everywhere we see State intervention in the programmes of stock improvement and the genetical methods employed have been of two kinds, negative and positive. The negative comprise all those projects which have for the object the prevention of the spread of bad germ plasm among the livestock population of the country. There are in this country vast numbers of inferior animals differing from the superior in virtue of their hereditary constitution. Their characterisation is not hopelessly bad, but it is not so good as that of the others. Since manifestly it is sound policy to breed only from the best there is no point in propagating the relatively unsatisfactory. Further, since improvement implies the manipulation of hereditary constitutions it is eminently desirable that the pedigrees and per- formance records of all animals used for breeding shall be known. For this reason the use of the scrub bull - the unknown - must be discouraged and even prevented. But besides the relatively inferior there are considerable numbers of animals in the livestock population of this country that carry in their hereditary constitutions factors corresponding to characters which are harmful to their exhibitors and which cannot easily be repaired. Lethal factors which lead to the development of characterisations that render their exhibitors non-viable are widespread and are responsible for much pre-natal and early post-natal death. Hereditary defects and derangements are common and can presently be removed only by the removal, by genetical methods of breeding, of the individuals carrying the factors corres- ponding to them. Possibly dominant lethals exist, but if so, then the individuals carrying factors for them die at a very early stage of development. Those that are recognised are recessives and in the simplex condition affect the viability of the individual either not at all or else but slightly, but cause death when present in the duplex condition. It is because such lethal recessives are fairly common that inbreeding is so dangerous. If the lethal character is expressed in the heterozygous condition its presence in the hereditary constitution of a stock can be recognised, but if it produces no visible effect when heterozygous, then its presence can be deduced indirectly by observing the absence of certain expected types among the offspring of a mating or by noting the occurrence of still births. Examples of the first group which produce a visible effect when in the heterozygous condition are the dominant yellow colour in the mouse, the hooding character in the canary and the bulldog calf. The occurrence of still- births must always arouse the suspicion that a recessive lethal factor is at work</page><page sequence="7">May l6, I93O JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 735 and that this in the duplex state renders the individual non-viable. An excellent example of this is the case of atresia coli in the horse. The problem of lethal factors links up with that of the record of performance. Ideally it is very desirable to test every stud animal for the presence of sublethal factors, and so only those sires which, when mated with their daughters, have produced a run of twenty normal offspring (of satisfactory performance) should be recognised for breeding purposes. Of course, such advice cannot be followed by the individual breeder, but the time will come, no doubt, when all uncastrated male domesticated animals of economic importance will be purchased by the State at killing price and kept alive until they have been thoroughly exposed to the progeny test. The State cannot afford to allow the sires to remain in private hands. Positive methods of livestock improvement aim at the provision of stock of known genetic constitution and possessing an accurate record of performance . Such schemes necessarily involve considerable genetical analysis of standards and of stock. Most, if not all, premium schemes thus far developed possess little, if any, value, for the reason that no sufficiently comprehensive records have been maintained. Nor can they ever be until all licensed sires become the property of the State and the experimental material of the scientist. All State intervention of this kind assumes that breeders generally are either incapable of assessing the real value of an individual or individuals at all accurately, or else cannot, for financial reasons, provide suitable sires for themselves. This attitude is amply justified, for there is no indication that there has been any rapid multiplication of the very good animals, and a corresponding reduction in the number of the inferior animals in the livestock population in this country. The general level of excellence of the commercial stock of this country is pitifully low. One of the most urgent tasks to be undertaken is the remedying of this state of things. The very first step to be taken is the breeding of pedigree stock according to genetically approved systems of breeding. The next step is to grade up commercial stocks by means of pedigreed sires and to produce first crosses for certain commercial purposes by the use of two pure-bred stocks. It is highly probable that for the special purpose of meat production the first cross will always be used. But the production of the first cross with its hybrid vigour depends entirely on the pre-existence of two complementary or compensatory types of pure bred and the success which now attends, and will attend, this system of breeding depends entirely upon the existence and maintenance of pure-bred stocks that can be crossed with advantage. The uniformity of excellence of the first cross is determined by the genetic purity of the parental stocks. In this production of first crosses of exceptional economic worth, large numbers of pure-bred stock of the highest quality are needed. These latter are also absolutely necessary for the most important yet simple task of grading up the pure-bred commercial stock of the country. It would seem to be the case, moreover, that in those instances in which the desired production depends on an intensive degree of</page><page sequence="8">736 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS May l6, I93O development of relatively simple single functions, such as milk or wool production &gt; the pure-bred is better than the first cross, and so for these purposes great numbers of graded pure-bred commercial animals are required. It is accepted that every possible economy in agricultural practice must be effected. Yet one does not have to travel far to find extravagances, probably preventable. For example, there is reason to think that the average life of a dairy cow is not more than three lactations, that one-quarter of the diary cow population of Scotland is replaced annually, that 40-50 per cent, of all mares put to the stallion each year fail to produce a foal. Surely these are matters of grave concern, for it h^s to be recognised that in all probability half this trouble is genetic in origin. At the present time we do not know what are the causes of this disposal of dairy cows before the reproductive phase of their life history is passed, but we may assume that 20 per cent, or more are disposed of because they have proved themselves to be genetically inferior animals. There is reason to hold the view that about 50 per cent, of infertile matings are due to genetic causes. It is known that defects and derangements of the reproductive system are inherited characters. Studies of the available records have shown that those stallions which have left but few foals, even though they themselves were from prolific sires, usually can claim relationship on the dam's side with individuals of low fertility. There is no doubt that low fertility, sterility, can be bred into a stock and that it is the soundest of policies to breed for fertility at the same time as one is selecting for other qualities of economic worth. The time must come when some standard of merit based on breeding record for mares, both in the show ring and in the stud book will be required. Regularity in breeding will be regarded as a highly-prized character, and the buyer will then be able to assess the fertility of the stock he buys and the menace of sterility will have been removed. Breeding is the solid foundation upon which all schemes of improvement mus be built ; expert husbandry can do much, but it cannot transform the hereditarily deficient into highly productive stock. The need for improving quality and for lowering costs of production is pressing. It can be met very largely by breeding for increased productivity in order to lower costs of production and by breeding for quality in order to increase returns. For milk production the first essential is to have high producers, to choose a bull on his dam's record and not upon the record of his sire's dam, to discard low producers and their progeny and to attempt to raise the level of production of the high producers by selection and careful breeding. There will be no problem of surplus milk if the low producers are eliminated and the average yield thereby improved. It is not generally recognised that one cow yielding 1,000 gallons is as profitable to her owner as are five, each of which produce but 650 gallons per lactation. Improvement in beef production is not so simple a matter for the dairy industry is responsible for the presence of great numbers of unsatisfactory stores. But the use of a good beef type sire for the unwanted calf of the dairy cow would do much to relieve the situation. It is in this connection that the scrub bull is at present</page><page sequence="9">May l6, I93O JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 737 so serious a menace. In the case of the pig, present-day opinion is definitely wrong in that it is commonly held that feeding and general management are the all-important factors in the attainment of success. This is not the case, as the records of any pig-testing station will show. Breeding (the hereditary constitution) affects the economics of commercial pig production in that prolificacy, economical conversion of food into pig, early maturity and the quality of the finished commodity are certainly inherited characters. These, then, are some of the problems which have to be investigated and solved by breeder and geneticist working in harmonious collaboration - the definition of standards, the analysis of excellence, the purification of stocks, the removal of the menace of sterility. The geneticist is completely ready to place his specialist knowledge of the fact and of method at the service of the industry, but the agri- culturalist is not yet ready to take advantage of the proferred help. Before this can become really effective, there must be new attitudes exhibited ; the breed societies must begin to think nationally as well as scientifically, standards must be modified, stud, herd and flock records must be far more comprehensive and must include the worst as well as the best, for failures are as important as successes in genetical analysis. It will be regrettable if the practitioner turns to the science only when forced to do so by financial anxiety, for science can give the joy of understanding and the thrill of power, which are contributions no less valuable than those which pertain to the materialities of existence. The Future. Though it is unwise to prophesy, it is permitted to exhibit reasonable expectation. During recent years work in the field of endocrinology has been exceedingly active, and to-day we are in possession of a great body of scientific fact which bears very directly indeed upon the problems of livestock breeding. If we examine these problems, we find that they refer to the phenomena of growth, fecundity, fertility, lactation and metabolic rate. It is in respect of these that the good type differs from the bad. Moreover, it is differences in the rate of growth, ultimate body size, the degree of fertility, the duration and intensity of lactation and in the level of metabolism that distinguish the present-day domestic stock from their wild progenitors. Now it is established beyond all doubt that differences in these characters are directly referable to the action of certain endocrine glands, especially to that of the pituitary. We know that the elaborated products of this gland determine the rate of growth and the limit of growth, the number of eggs available for fertilisation, the intensity and duration of lactation and the intensity of the metabolism, and, also, working through the thyroid and the sex glands, the local deposition of fat. It would seem, then, that what artificial selection and controlled breeding have done has been to isolate and develop strains of animals remarkable for certain types of pituitary, thyroid and sex gland functioning. Reference to the various types of man produced by the various kinds and grades of disorder of these ductless glands will reveal every</page><page sequence="10">738 journal of the royal society of arts May 16, 1930 type of domestic animal of economic importance. That which is abnormal in man is the standard of the ideal among his animals. If this is so, we may assume with confidence that the future will see a very widespread application of the facts of endocrinology to the problems of animal breeding. That which presently is attained only by the exceedingly slow process of selective breeding will be achieved in each generation by the administration of the appropriate endocrine product prepared by the biochemist. The rate of growth, for example, will be controlled by the administration of the appropriate pituitary preparation ; other preparations will be used to control fertility, fat deposition and so forth, and then the breeder will not depend for success upon his incomplete control of the somewhat blind forces of Nature, but will have the power to do whatever he will through his ability to supply to the animal those substances which control all those vital processes which are concerned in the development of qualities of economic worth. The lag between demonstrated scientific fact and its in- corporation into practice is usually about 20 to 50 years. All these things can be done at the present time in the case of animals of no economic importance, such as the rat and the mouse. Surely, in this country, there must be those who would wish to see this work extended without delay to the horse, the cow, the sheep and the pig. But the fact is that there is no research institution in this country that is in a position to undertake such work, nor will there be until the livestock industry becomes aware of the promise that this work offers and demands that those scientists who are enrolled in its service shall be provided with the means to work with the animals of the farm and not solely with animals that the livestock-breeders would call vermin. DISCUSSION The Chairman said he was bound to utter a mild protest against the lecturer's statement that farmers had better turn over to stock and consider only that in future, for he held that arable farming as it existed in this country, with suitable modifications, would hold its own. When one considered at what rate the suggested changes of methods could be brought about he felt he had rather more hopes of the arable farmer than of the stock farmer. When the points put before the meeting by Professor Crew were carefully considered it would be seen that the spread of knowledge and the adoption of scientific method would lead an assault against the oldest and most impregnable fortress of British farming. Historically we in this country prided ourselves on our knowledge of stock and stock-breeding. It was in this country that the principles of selection and pure-line breeding were first of all laid down, and they led to the foundation of those breeds of cattle and sheep and horses which had gone all round the world. In consequence the belief of the British stock-keepers in themselves and their methods had been very strongly verified. However, some of those who looked at these things a little bit from the outside were beginning to think that in this country pedigree had become a fetish and was doing harm when it ought to be doing good. Breeds were being created, established and run entirely for their own sake as breeds and not for the economic values that might result from this pure breeding. In the accepted types</page><page sequence="11">May l6, I93O JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 739 of live stock breeding points were established, and as it were consecrated, by the Royal and other Agricultural Societies, with their show organizations - as ends in themselves. In consequence there was at the present time an almost entire loss among what might be called the official stockbreeders of the country of an economic outlook, and the stock business was dominated by a form of social competition. It was a fine thing to win a prize for this or that kind of sheep or cattle at the Royal Agricultural Society, and men were prepared to pay very big money in order to find their place in the prize list, but what this had to do with the farmer or with the economic production of meat or milk or wool everybody seemed to have forgotten. He did not think the lecturer had been violent enough in speaking of the danger that was falling upon us through our pride of race and of what we had done in the way of livestock breeding, and our refusal to look at the lessons of the scientific breeder and of the economist who summed up his ledger and his profit-and-loss. Suppose one wanted a bull. The prize-winning records and the pedigree were always given ; those were its advertisement. But the wise man looked at the herd book for many generations for a very different purpose ; he wanted to know how many calves in that one family there had been in five years. He wanted to know, if he could deduce from the studbook, what had been the prolificacy of the family, which was a thing of fundamental value for the breeder. It was the same in regard to constitution. Every fancier knew when dealing with plants or animals certain families which threw up magnificent things on the show bench ; but, as the old Eastern king said, " My children are few but they are lions." These prize winners often occurred in an inherently weak race, and they should be spotted with a view to their elimination. The evil about stockbreeding as it was at present carried on was the lack of experi- mental verification, not only of things like prolificacy and constitution but of some of the dogmas and maxims that a breeder had most at heart. Suppose they went out among the breeders of Shire horses. One of the things they were called upon to admire and look at as a breed point, which was a matter of especial pride to the stud groom, who had so much to say in the breeding of these horses, was the hair - " This magnificent hair." Of course, from the practical, workaday point of view of the horse that hair was nothing but a nuisance and a source of possible expense and disease, but they were told that this hair was correlated with the bone and was a sign of vigour, and therefore Shire horses with a kind of feather-brush all round their feet were getting the prize-money. He did not say it was not so ; it might be perfectly true, for they must never forget that the observation of the fancier and the breeder might be founded on more than they were aware of ; but had they any experimental verification of the theory that one could not get bone and vigour of constitution unless one had this great development of hair about the feet ? There were many other things in the same way. The lecturer, for instance, mentioned the question of the conflict between the breeder and the wool-buyer about the constitution of the fleece. It was known that the breeder of mountain sheep demanded kemp rather than wool, because he said those rams that had a lot of kemp in the fleece were the rams which had constitution and could stand up against the cold and wet of the hillside. Did anyone know? He did not say the breeder was not correct. Again it was the fruit of observation, perhaps ; but it was quite possible that he was simply utilizing a kind of anthropomorphic idea that, because kemp looked good, tough stuff, it conferred on the animal the power of resisting cold in the young state. He knew that experimental work had been started, with Professor Crew in charge of it, on that very point ; but it was necessary to get experimental verification for many of the most cherished beliefs of the practical breeder. There were so often analogies which worked disaster.</page><page sequence="12">740 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS May l6, I930 He would give another practical illustration. The breeders of Hampshire sheep were all out for early maturity as the characteristic of the breed, and in consequence, in order to show early maturity and bring out the points of early maturity, the shows and the ram sales took place at a very early day in the history of the sheep. Sheep which were bred about the New Year come to the ram sales and the shows in July and early August, when the lambs are barely seven months old, and one naturally enough got the idea that the animal which could grow to the finest type in seven months was the animal to breed from. It was a good, sound idea, and it had brought about the early maturing power in the Hampshires. But then by false analogy the Hampshire breeder said : " If I want these early maturing things I must have only a young ram and must only breed from a ram lamb and what was the consequence ? A Hampshire ram lamb in the front flight might sell for 300 guineas, or let for anything from 250 to 300 guineas a season when a lamb, but in the following year his price would drop to £20. Now, genetically speaking, he was the same animal and must produce exactly the same kind of stock, yet by this kind of false analogy, lacking any experimental verification whatever, there was this extraordinary difference in the valuation the practical man attached to the animal. Let them think of all the other consequences that had followed upon this one-sided selection. Probably of all recognised breeds of our sheep the Hampshire was the least prolific. Why ? Because they were selected at seven months old. If one selected the animal at seven months one was sure to pick the singles and never a twin, and for generations and generations the Hampshire had been selected for singles, till twin production had been pretty well bred out. It was a very good Hampshire flock that would give an average of a lamb to a ewe, and yet when they turned to other breeds, for instance, the cross-breeds, the first crosses between the Border Leicesters and the Cheviots, they would get 150 or 170 or even 180 per cent. He would not enlarge upon this subject, but shows and show systems had got to be revised. The lecturer had referred to the desirability of sires being tested for their progeny before they were brought into use. As far as he knew this was unknown in the British shows ; but in Sweden and Norway one would find classes for the bull with his four daughters, and the milk records of those daughters were taken into account. The judging was not merely upon the appearance of the animals but upon their record of performance, and the prize was awarded on that. Of course, there were conflicting interests all the time. There was the scrub bull to which the lecturer had alluded. He (the Chairman) remembered only too well when he was at the Ministry and was concerned in trying to promote legislation for the elimination of scrub bulls, that this was defeated by the opposition of the dairy interest, for they wanted their cows got into calf but that the calf should be as small as possible. They were so strong a section of the community that there interest was allowed to outweigh the general interests of stockbreeding in the country. The lecturer had referred to three lactations as the dairy life of the cow. That was brought about, he thought, not by disease factors coming in but by the utter refusal of the dairy owner, in districts like Lancashire and Yorkshire, to breed at all. He was close to a magnificent breeding area for dairy cows, and could draw in good cows for milk. There was an immense wastage of the finest type of cows in that way. What was the remedy for it all ? Professor Crew had suggested the intervention of the State, and that might come, but he would suggest more and more education as a preliminary stage. Let them get their stockkeepers imbued with the general principles of the fundamental sciences and able to take notice of the guidance and apply the methods which Professor Crew and his colleagues could give them.</page><page sequence="13">May l6, 1930 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 74I Major Jervoise remarked that he had a ram which had been operated on by the system mentioned by the lecturer, and it gave great amusement when the committee went through and found an eight or nine years ram used. Mr. James Mackintosh (National Institute for Research in Dairying, Reading) said he felt a certain amount of trepidation because Professor Crew had been speaking mainly from the genetical standpoint. But he could not but be primarily interested in trying to learn about the practice of stockbreeding. The lecturer had made one or two remarks about which he would like to ask questions. When referring to the slides showing the occurrence of lethal factors, which were very interesting, Professor Crew had said, he understood, that they were comparatively common. He would have thought they were very uncommon indeed, with the possible exception of one breed of cattle. In the majority of the breeds of British cattle these occurrences were found very rarely. Could the lecturer make the point clearer, and perhaps give some percentages of cases, if there were any in his possession ? Reference had been made to a comparatively low standard in British livestock, but on the whole it seemed to him difficult to make a statement of that kind, for in most breeds there was a great variety and there were good and bad and medium qualities. To make the statement that we had a large number of inferior animals it seemed necessary to have standards by which to judge and he understood Professor Crew to say that such standards were lacking. He would like the societies to have a more definite standard of the type of animals which were the best. He felt he must stand up for those who were interested in breeding dairy cattle. The Chairman had referred to show standards and their non-practical nature. He agreed, but he thought that section of the farming industry which was interested in milk production had progressed further towards more useful standards than anything the Chairman had said would lead the audience to believe. In many dairy breeds there was an advanced register, qualification for which was a minimum milk yield in respect of cows and for bulls the possession of so many daughters which had attained the standard. They had at the London dairy show a rule that every cow exhibited must have had a certain yield of milk. They had in a majority of counties herd competitions where all the stock owned by the competitors were judged at the farm ; it was not a question of selecting one animal and sending it to the show but of judging all the animals on the farm. They had also the judging of bulls and their progeny. The question of the improvement of dairy cows was being taken up with great interest everywhere. With these points in mind he would suggest that at any rate the dairying interest did not merit some of the adverse criticism passed by the Chairman. Mr. W. Rogers said he should go away dazed, for it seemed a very slow game® Perhaps one's great-great-grandchildren would know something about this business. He suggested to the lecturer that perhaps their breeding of animals to-day was - he would not say unnatural, but not so natural as it used to be. He supposed in the days of the wild boar and sow, the sow bred once a year ; and the cow bred once a year. In the present unnatural days one did not think the sow was paying her way unless she had two litters a year at least, and the same with the cow, who must produce much more milk than before. He remembered going a few years ago to the dispersal sale of a noted South Down flock, and the auctioneer made the remark that the flock was going down because they had lost the shepherd. There was more in feeding for producing good animals than they sometimes thought. It depended on the feeder, not only in the show ring</page><page sequence="14">742 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS May l6, I930 but in the general utility of the flock and herd. He would like the lecturer to give some information as to the right kind of feeding. He was told quite seriously by a scientific gentleman recently that he could double the fecundity of his pigs by using the right vitamins, and the same gentleman also spoke of right feeding giving 100 per cent, fertility in his poultry in the matter of eggs. He felt that feeding practice must go with this genetical theory, which was tremendously interesting but was very slow. In breeding shire horses one great trouble was a disease known as joint ill. Was there any solution for that trouble, so that they could assure a healthy foal ? Mr. Urquhart Ramsay (Victoria, Australia) expressed his thanks to Professor Crew for his interesting lecture, and to the Chairman for his remarks. Professor Crew at the beginning said the improvement in stock must come mainly through the improvement of stock-breeders, and that seemed quite sound ; but he went on to make out that they were to be in the hands of those who would give them gland products. There were many freaks in stock, in his own country as well as in England ; much attention was given to the production of freak types, but there was too much neglect of economic points. The Lecturer, in reply, said it certainly was his opinion that arable farming was not as bright in its prospects as stock farming, but it was only an opinion and he was perfectly willing to withdraw it and replace it by another if good grounds could be shown. He had been glad to hear from Major Jervoise that an operation had been successful. There was no reason why it should not be, but one wanted to know the ultimate effects upon the individual and upon the product. Was it a sound agricul- tural practice ? He doubted it, in this country, In the case of cattle one had con- templated the practice, but the difficulty was in the animals getting so heavy. He was delighted to be criticised so lucidly in regard to lethals and the frequency of their incidence in domestic stock. He and his critic were both right, because if there was a genetic explanation of lethals then it should be the simplest thing, by adopting intelligent methods of breeding, to build up a herd. For reasons that were feasible to the breeder a herd of that kind could not be built up, for one would be selecting for many things : productivity, for instance, and one could not get productivity if something was missing. Therefore, it was not to be wondered at if he said, looking at all domestic animals, that lethals were common, though in the critic's experience they were rare. He agreed that in a flock of the first class there were not any, but for the whole country he could produce figures which would be convincing. He had thought he was careful to make the point that the dairy breeder had set the pace to other breeders in this country. The register had had more to do with dairy improvement than any other thing. Mr. Rogers had raised the very fascinating problem in biology of the unnaturalness of husbandry and its effects. It was difficult to understand what should be meant by " natural " in the sense referred to. It seemed to him that the living individual was marvellously plastic. After all, the animal they thought of buying was not the animal that had been living on the Steppes. For generations types had been selected, types to which the open plain would be un- natural. He found no difficulty in assuming that one's environment and system of husbandry were the natural environment for the animal. He agreed that more could be done by improvement in feeding and development in scientific knowledge as to what was the best food ; but that was outside his theme that evening. He knew only about as much concerning it as the practical breeder knew, but one could not really know much about animals unless one kept them.</page><page sequence="15">May l6, I93O JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 743 A question was asked about joint ill. If the records kept by the veterinary surgeon were studied they would indicate to a man like himself that the disease was of hereditary transmission. But that was not enough. One must know the conditions under which the individual had its being, and so forth. But the records certainly seemed to indicate hereditary transmission. On the proposition of the Chairman the thanks of the meeting were accorded to Professor Crew for his paper. Mr. T. B. Silcock, Member of the Council of the Royal Agricultural Society writes : - Many thanks for the proof of Professor Crew's paper, amost interesting contribution with which every one must agree, more particularly with that par twhere he states; that the basis of all progress in the future lies with the improvement of education in the farming community. In connection with this I would like to suggest that more attention might be paid to milk recording, inasmuch as the man who records begins to realise his need of knowledge, and is more susceptible to new ideas than one who does not ; and, although one agrees, theoretically, with the idea of putting the whole of the sires of the country under Government control, I feel, in view of the character of the individual, that this is a matter for some generations hence. But if the Government would subsidise fully the milk recording movement, and, possibly, other movements of a similar nature, they would advance the education of the farmer much more quickly than by any other method. With regard to Professor Crew's criticism in connection with the life of dairy cows being about three lactations ; here again there can be little doubt that he is erring on the generous side. There may have been an economic reason for this curtailment of the life of a dairy cow, especially when it is remembered that probably the reason for it was because of the lack of mineral content of the dairy cow's food in the old days, and a consequent draining of her system, making her more susceptible to disease. Now, however, that minerals have been introduced, and, recently, the introduction of vitamin D in connection with the minerals, may we not look for an increased length of usefulness in the dairy cow ?</page></plain_text>
