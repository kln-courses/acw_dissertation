ISBN 978 ο ig 957994 5. £35/ $50. Theists faced by David Hume's trenchant criticisms of the ar guments put forward in natural theology to warrant belief in God have sometimes sought comfort in the fact that Hume nevertheless still affirms some form of such belief. For example, in the final section of his Natural History of Religion (§15) Hume comments that 'the universal propensity to believe in invisible, intelligent power... may be considered as a kind of mark or stamp, which the divine workman has set upon his work', while at the end of his Dialogues concerning Natural Religion (§12) Philo (who is generally taken to present Hume's own views) allows, in spite of his criticisms, that 'the cause or causes of order in the universe probably bear some remote ana logy to human intelligence'. Even if these statements are to be understood as reflecting Hume's own convictions rather than as disingenuous sops to assuage critics, Hume accompanies them with observations that undermine any comfort theists may seek from them. In the case of the former example he suggests that whatever fundamental divine plan underlies the world is 'inex plicable and incomprehensible' and points out that although in principle 'human reason' may have the 'noble privilege' of at taining 'the knowledge of the supreme Being', in practice 'the religious principles, which have ... prevailed in the world' resem ble 'sick men's dreams' or 'the playsome whimsies of monkies in human shape'; in the case of the latter example he argues that whatever 'analogy' may be held to obtain it is too exiguous to warrant any 'inference that affects human life'. When such ob servations are linked with his criticisms, they put in serious question any attempt to maintain that Hume presents more than what Thomas Holden calls 'a "liminal" natural theology that stops short' of any ambition to claim 'knowledge of the deity's distinctive intrinsic character' (p. 20). Holden's particular interest in this thorough, perceptive, and readable study of Hume's thought about God is to show that whatever 'deity' may be identified in such a liminal natural the ology, it cannot be considered to have moral attributes. On the basis of Hume's account of what he basically means by the term 'god', namely, as referring to 'the original cause or organizing principle of the ordered universe' (p. 7), Holden carefully © The Author 2011.

His conclusion so far as religion is concerned is that, while Hume may never explicitly endorse such a position (cf. p. 50), what he puts forward is a 'moral atheism' that 'denies the existence, not merely of a morally praiseworthy god, but of a morally morally assessable god' (p. 8). The heart of Holden's case lies in drawing out the implications of combining Hume's sentimentalist theory of morality with 'his view that the original cause [i.e. god] is beyond the natural reach of our passions' (p. 51). According to Hume, there is no mind-independent and immutable moral order that exists over against human beings and provides them with the norms for moral judgements. Moral qualities are to be recognized as the offspring of human passions: 'the world of moral standards is ultimately constituted by characteristic sentiments of approba tion and disapprobation that humans naturally feel in response to particular sorts of actions, motives, or character traits' (p. 96). Something is good or is a virtue, for me and for others, if we react to it with such feelings as approval, delight, and admiration; it is bad or morally evil if we respond to it with such feelings as disapproval, uneasiness, and condemnation. Accordingly, moral judgements are fundamentally a matter of how our passions respond to what we encounter in our experi ence. The problem for any religion that seeks to use theism to warrant its influence on and directions for human conduct is that so far as the deity is properly understood as the ultimate cause and organizer of all that is, the deity lies far beyond the reach of what any human being could experience and, accordingly, react to. While stories may be told about god or the gods and while some people may claim to have experiences of some such reality, Hume is not convinced that they are the product of actual en counter with deity. Affirming the radical otherness of God, he dismisses those who use religious stories and alleged religious experiences to claim otherwise as 'self-deluding enthusiasts' (p. 63). But since God is so beyond human experience and ap prehension that the reality and acts of the divine are beyond the range of our passions, there can be no justified moral judgements arising from our passions in relation to the reality and acts of God. Hence moral judgements about God and moral convictions supposedly warranted by a moral character attributed to God are without rational justification.</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 404 Furthermore, as Holden points out, Hume's appreciation of the otherness of God leads him to reject any claim that God may have 'a sentimental psychology like ours' (p. 142) and ac cordingly may see and judge things in any way that resembles how we react to them. While our judgements are related to our environment, the position of the cause and organizer of all that is must be recognized to be incomprehensibly different. In conse quence, if we appreciate that 'the first cause or designer lacks... anthropomorphic sentimental psychology' we should also appreciate that we have no way of envisaging, even faintly, how deity might react to what is and to what occurs. (Incidentally, this argument may be considered to have become even stronger in practice since Hume's day as cosmologists report that our planet is part of star system that is one of billions in a galaxy that itself is one of billions: to seek to envisage the awareness and responses of a creator and organizer of this order is mind-boggling.) Holden's view of Hume's thorough-going understanding of the otherness of God leads him to challenge the widespread view that Hume considered that 'the evils of the world provide circumstantial evidence that the deity is not moved by moral concerns' (p. 145; cf. p. 175). Although Hume has Philo main tain, on the basis of the empirical evidence provided by the state of the world, that 'the hypothesis of divine indifference "seems by far the most probable'" (Dialogues concerning Natural Religion,Religion, §11), Holden argues that in this case 'Hume's version of the evidential argument is best understood not as a serious and sincere case for divine amorality, but as a parody of trad itional core natural theology' (p. 145; cf. p. 169 f.). His justifica tion for this interpretation of Hume's text is that when Hume's views of the otherness of God are properly taken into account, Hume could not have accepted the supposition that the empirical evidence of what occurs in the world can provide information from which judgements about the character and behaviour of the cause and organizer of all can be made. As Philo has asserted earlier in the Dialogues, human experience is too imperfect and limited to warrant any 'probable conjecture concerning the whole of things' (Dialogues concerning Natural Religion, §7). Holden accordingly concludes that 'while Hume's Dialogues have been enormously influential in drawing attention to the evidential ar gument' from evil to divine amorality, Hume himself 'does not actually endorse it himself' (p. 179). Finally Holden argues that claims about determinism do not make any difference to this conclusion. Pointing out the implications of theological notions</page><page sequence="4">405 REVIEWS of predestination may provide a way of scandalizing Christian thinkers, but for Hume, even if it be held that the causal nexus means that 'the deity actively causes all the evils of the world by way of remote deterministic foreordination', it does not provide 'a persuasive argument for any form of moral atheism'. Again the incomprehensibility of the deity means that no con elusions can be reached about the character and responsibility of the divine. On the other hand, the form of determinism that Hume does entertain means that for him 'the first cause of all cannot... make moral claims upon us,... nor, correlatively, can we owe it any moral duties' (p. 206 f.). We are free of divine threats and demands. The importance of Hume's views for theological understand ing today and, to a large extent, the theological value of Holden's probing study of those views and his suggestions about what is implied by them even when not explicitly asserted by Hume himself, depend upon the acceptability of Hume's sentimentalist theory of morality and his recognition of the radical otherness of God. Hume may not persuade everyone that his moral and theo logical positions are correct, but Holden's study of his work is an important contribution to clarifying his ideas and their signifi cance. It deserves to be read carefully and its points pondered seriously. His analysis indicates that basic doubts should be en tertained about the widespread claim that Hume argues from the natural evils found in the world to the amorality of God. It also strongly suggests that Hume's argument for that moral atheism derives from his views on the nature of morality and the reality of God. doi: ι ο. 1093/jts/flq171 David A.
