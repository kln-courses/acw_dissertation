<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANTI-KARAITE WRITINGS OF SAADIAH FRAGMENTS OF ANTI-KA RAITE WRITINGS OF SAADITA T IN THE IMPERIAL PUBLIC LIBRARY AT ST. PETERSBURG. Dedicated to the memory of my friend DAVID KAUFMANN, who departed this life too soon for the interests of Jewish literature. THE Imperial Public Library at St. Petersburg recently obtained possession of the Antonine Collection. Among the latter's Hebraeo-Arabic fragments I was so fortunate as to discover portions of two works of Saadiah's, written by him against the Karaites. No. 204 of the said col- lection consists of two leaves of parchment joined together, but there were several leaves between them which have become lost. The content of the first leaf was taken from a work in which the Oral Tradition was defended, not against any particular author, but against the Kara- ites in general, whose arguments are controverted. As far as is known at present, this was done by Saadiah in tt:n&amp; ::nr (The Book of Distinction, cited by Hebrew authors under the title of ,nrwn nao or r,non 'mo), a book which was recently subjected to a thorough discussion by Poznanski (J. Q. R., X, pp. 244-252). It is therefore probable that the leaf in question must have belonged to that work. The leaf commences somewhere in the middle of the eighth point of dispute, and deals with points of detail, such as the second day of the festival (nr Si w = 1 nr), and with tradition in general, and runs in the Arabic text as follows (the MS. only rarely 655</page><page sequence="2">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW gives diacritical points; for the rest the spelling of the MS. has been preserved):- l=4 iminD .irnn s npl 5 Na 'ipy -.na nt i , n, (fol. i a) to onyp p: iSN Dnr5K sm I n i lnaDln NA yi n , pnyw IN nrf5nA nrI a rm ?nNK 'K , IK na rnDoKKN p4n ty Ri XfW nwnp Ip~ taS oi 515i arr nip n piK a$ np %K 5IK ? n5w nn' ich Kna~n~o nn&amp;6a S i : anna p: D n D?S mm K:pinK n r%54' pnO .pn pain Sn io pU OnS 1nr ,t ,sMn~ .pw) na Infy, ' in 1ifm KD Itu8 N 6SK1 #mt nK nu t pn:non pmna 'n w pmva mnnm a y sw n v Kn: nli,aS Ynw annl ilta mPDp a ,'1aY 40aa K n /K nKb3 n* s nvna nvw In:n nlvyn ty v in n n Zny 1K3 Km Nna1 NS ,n-m'y tiin iDn nzrn n3iun m ym 1DI t Kn W panr PD Opr p1 D33 4t )S1 N5ir nI v sWy nb nl fin r rC 'sa t4b4n IKE K,1n3iW n,w ~ p ]s 1m i 1 a= int j rK n a in Nminiv nainvS 5y npD* pN n fl ina nnia n finl pa 6 v i Ia aW annw s'i c ni -I -IS iNtIai 'ma Nn3 Dn nKin Kbi n356K IK n :n:S n 5 i pnD Snnv -itKWK nuK pm IN timD iNKY^K 9D KInn ra&amp; KI: n1'z vsnim Dni nnDt niqp: nNK3 I n D4 i iTin:s 't s'a n IK pn rlipyS mnrpn 5mp 'inKYKSK aD j- 5 DSl w n pil ipN- Qpn i)l in nn:i ' ^oSK: PSK &lt;BK1 wK tN ri KSD 'nn3^&amp;&lt; Da^ Kn Dpa nSy 5r - in i sh .: n mintpNa NISSK 1 '4 (1fo I tl .

The missing part of the sentence may have run as follows: [Certain laws were revealed to Moses conditionally]- the execution of which was only to be promulgated at the time required for it. It is necessary to assume, in reference to thQ prohibition to add anything to the Mosaic Law (Deut. iv. 2), that the second festival day (i. e. M1v' 5VW 4') :lt t1s) existed already at the time of Moses; namely, conditionally, to be observed in case</page><page sequence="4">658 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the people would have to be in exile; and, for this reason, the law was not promulgated till the required time'. In the same way, everything (Rabbinical) which is believed to be contradictory to the Bible, is capable of being reconciled. This is all the more the case whenever it is thought that two biblical passages are contradictory, as we have already explained regarding the rule (of the thirteen rules of interpretation) of R. Ishmael W:anrV W t t nK ,lt ptiwnD1n2. 9. I have given careful attention to the method of the Bible, and found that the latter usually deals with the subjects in an ample way and explains them in detail. This you see in the expositions regarding the Work of the Tabernacle t1-= WIVYD (Exod. xxv seq.), the Chapter of Consecration tlMK1 I nWd' (Lev. viii-ix), the Numberings of Israel S'WV 1pbJ (Num. i), the Dedi- cation of the Altar nrl,1l n13Mr (Num. vii). In view of such method, it is highly improbable that the law about Running Issue n1?t (Lev. xv) should have been formulated without explanation, or that the law regarding the leap-year should have been limited to the single word :l3 (Exod. xxiii. I5). It is obvious that a sufficient explanation must have accompanied all these ordinances; and as we do not possess such in writing, it was given by word of mouth. io. A wise man who expounds a law or a narrative, must sufficiently explain it when delivering it for the first time. On repetition, a mere allusion will suffice. Thus, e. g., about the law of the burnt-offering (Lev. i); in the first instance, the explanation is very diffuse: ,lt2 ,'pl lp'tl ,in pSi11 ,nM ,nnr ,^w rnl ,fn; but on repetition we have briefly il l' pn (Num. xviii. iI), and nothing more. On the other hand, it is impossible for a law to be dictated in the first instance by a mere allusion. Such mere allusions as, for instance, to prayer as conveyed by the words Fr1nnn NKli (Deut. x. 2I), or to civil jurisdiction by the words rt3l5~~ 1n (Exod. xxi. 22), and others, are only possible when a full explanation by oral tradition preceded them. Speaking generally, everything brought forward here against the eight portions of the objection3 tends, at the same time, to prove the truth of tradition, for mainstays of those problems, which emanate 1t twns nilwzn (Lyck, I864), n.

Having set forth these ten modes, I proceed to the fifteen objections which those people make against the Mishna. In the first place, I refuted those who meet the question: "Why they adopted the Bible and rejected the Mishna ? " with the reply, that "they saw that the nation was unanimous in the adoption of the Bible, but differed in their opinions regarding the Mishna; for, since we saw that people (fol. i b) whose views varied in respect to many things, yet believed in this (in the truth of the Bible), we knew therefore that if it (the Bible) were untrue, the (whole) people would not have believed in it." When I heard this reply, I commenced to consider it closely, and I found that it was refuted by twelve arguments. Their assertion, that they found that "the nation was in agreement in regard to the Bible," is contradicted by seven arguments, which I brought forward against those who adhere to the agreement of the nation2, as explained above. Their argument, that "they found that the people, whose opinions differed regarding several things, yet agreed as to this" (as to the Bible)-considering thus the people's difference of opinion about many things as an argument-can be refuted in eight ways3. In the first place, they reply to the questioner by returning the question. He asks, "Why do you contradict the Mishna ?" They reply: "Because we contradict the Mishna." I mean to say, that he who simply turns the question put to him, and makes an answer out of it, is the weakest (disputant); for it is just the same as if one were to reply to the question: " Why do you not accept the decision of the judge?" with the answer: "Because I do not accept the decision of the judge." For the question put to one of them (the Karaites), is also put to all of them: "Why do you all contradict it (the Mishna)?" Secondly, if we were to judge from people's difference of opinion about many things about the correctness of that about which they are in agreement, it would be only necessary for those, who wish their inventions to become adopted as truths, to differ about other things, so as to gain for the point on which they agree, recognition as being the correct one. Thirdly, we see now how the Christian nation is split up into four 1 I am myself in doubt whether my conception of this sentence is correct. 2 The " agreement" (Arabic r5nis) plays an important part in Mahom- medan theology, and thence the Karaites derived it, perhaps already since the time of Anan. 3 This ought probably to read " in five ways" (,i for i).</page><page sequence="6">66o THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW sections, in regard to the founder of their religion. One section maintains that his body and his spirit are God (of divine substance). Another section says that his body and his spirit are created; another asserts that his body was created, but that his spirit is God; another again says, he was only like one of the prophets. They all agree therefore about his superiority; our opponents must, consequently, adopt as true all that about which the Christians agree1. Fourthly, if the difference of opinion of the sons of Israel on many points is to be taken as a criterion for the Bible, which is recognized by all of them, it follows that the tradition, which was once also recognized by all 2, must be true. Fifthly, if, as they opine, this difference serves to demonstrate the truth of the Bible, the All-Wise would have had to uphold always differences of opinion in his nation for the purpose of confirming his writing. It would not therefore be feasible to do away with the differences, because their disappearance would involve a proof of the Biblical truth. The differences would thus have to endure for ever. It is therefore obvious that the whole argumentation of our oppo- nent constitutes the opposite of the truth. Besides, I have met with people (Karaites), who maintain that those who handed down the Mishna by tradition had themselves invented it; they were, perhaps, led astray by such expressions as ljprnil 'W1s (Sabbath, 15 b), &amp;c. I must therefore explain..... The first leaf ends here; it is a good specimen of a dialectical controversy on religion as carried on at the commencement of the tenth century, the trrnns 2:n having been written in 926-7. In those days it frequently happened-as it also happens sometimes in our days-in such disputations, that the object was to fasten upon the words of the opponent and so to drive him into a corner. This has been noted by Haja Gaon, in reference to Saadiah's argument regarding the second festival, in the before-mentioned Responsunum: nrtnP nnnwT ntt W v 'w p: Dn1n?ip' nK nmn w l n iip r "t ;n'' yi 1Ur3 (vn I1nw nnwn, 1 This argument is in reality identical with the preceding one, except for its being illustrated by an example. Makrizi maintains, moreover, that Anan admitted the mission of Jesus and Mahommed. Jakub Kirkisani (p. 305 of my edition) attributes to a portion of the Karaites a milder view about Jesus. Hadasi borrowed from this author. 2 i. e. before Anan's schism, and, in previous ages, before the secession of the Sadducees.</page><page sequence="7">ANTI-KARAITE WRITINGS OF SAADIAH ed. Lyck, p. 4). If we may believe the Karaite Jacob Alkirkisani , Saadiah would have first said, that the Rabbinical Calendar (mny) existed since Moses, and that afterwards he said that it originated with Adam (lt: 'Pl nDW tn prm Srpr t&amp;^ -N nn Nn tn -11p=5 IN }5&amp; sDiwK) (Kitab Alanwar, nmpm 2, 3K3 I3). The second leaf of our fragment is directed against the Karaite author of the nrr ms' :imn3 (Kitab Alfadhaich, "The Book of Shameful Things," sc. of the Rabbanites). I found a note from a Karaite source, unfortunately without any further description, that Ibn Sakaveihi's book was thus entitled. This has now been fully confirmed by a fragment of the Arabic original of Ibn Ezra's ,'rnrSm ,i5tpm. The fourth chapter (entitled cfi tnomSN m ,-, Hebr. p ,nn,m irv rman 1n n iwn) concludes thus: "'t I1K nyD a ln p -i" tDamb nrtm i s nmn: awnv ;l41pet p 2 Ni ,n 4!

This quotation seems to prove that Saadiah's writing against Ibn Sakaveihi was part of the rpnri :smn:; but in the quotations of Mobashshi Halevi and of the Karaite 1 Prof. Steinschneider will, no doubt, admit that Kirkisani's name was Abu-Jusuf Jakub, although he has thus far had no opportunity to retract his former assertion. 2 Dukes, in the Magazine t's (II, 137), turned the Arabic preposition 5r (Hebr. jg) into the proper noun Ali. 3 On the Arabic expression ,'S 5nsnn cf. Dozy, Supplem., I, 327. The words 5rNrnnr}N ,5 were perhaps embodied also in the title of Saadiah's polemic, and a corruption of this was perhaps the origin of the enigmatical and, as yet, unexplained name of a work of Saadiah's cited by Nissim of Kirvan, who says (see D^,:n =m, Hebrew part, fol. i6 b): nrann arDa in V'n mD,n nrnnn ', (sic lege) -nq 1 an3 sswuwr, wv1i wip:;n stnoin S. Poznanfski made another conjecture (J. Q.

We are therefore obliged, not only to read lirln:in instead of nimzin:z, as Munk and Dukes read in the Hebrew translation, but to correct also in the Arabic original nrn m into r,ri . However this may be, the next fragment2 gives us, for the first time, full information, not only about Saadiah's polemical reply, but also about the contents and the division of Ibn Sakaveihi's pamphlet, which was calcu- lated to rouse Saadiah's anger, if only by its insulting and provoking title. We need not be surprised that the later Gaon of Sora designates his opponent by the con- temptuous title of 5n,i3 Kin (that ignoramus). After these introductory remarks, let us hear Saadiah himself.

This method is as if one would copy a whole section (rvWt) of the Bible, whe.n ever he wants to quote one Biblical verse. He (Ibn Sakaveihi) does it because his book is quite useless; by far the greatest part of it contains only the assertions of the (Karaite) mob, and if he had only quoted the text required, the book would be quite empty; he stuffed it therefore with ample Rabbinical quotations. I found also that he cites that portion of a Rabbinical passage which in hi i, nfirms his oinins sw, whilst he omits all that part which, though connected with the former, tends to disprove them. Thus, in reference to the new moon, he quotes from the wn:j3 nmm the words: wt1p3 ot nrM1 jn ) INW 1t ipi'ls ln1W1p, but he takes good care not to quote from the same passage the words wVlpl) nt 'n nn ^ yN51, because he saw that the obvious meaning is, that it can be arranged without observation of the moon [i. e. by calculation of the calendar]. 1 Torat Kohanim, TnN, X, ? 2-3 (ed. Warsaw, I866, fol. 94 a). 664</page><page sequence="11">ANTI-KARAITE WRITINGS OF SAADIAH 665 The most important and worst part is, that he alters and corrupts the Rabbinical text whenever the latter does not suit him. Thus he found in the nIlHn (KnD1in) that it is permitted on Friday, on the eve of Sabbath, to let the water flow into the garden: W3 tpnrM nt? nwvn i niz rnz tbnnn l i13iwr n wg nrw in may cm , which he alters in his book into ty nr:w :Dm ) lD rnvDwn rbt n:irn 1; and then he makes six propositions on the ground of a falsehood. When I saw this, I said, in the words of Scripture, -vpi tnmw ,om6n 2. And, as I live, he was quite right when he gave to his book the title of Book of Shameful Things (nK~Ts :nRfn); for it is a book which sets forth his own shameful things and his own confusion, as was explained by me in connexion with the verse InNK rnD:l 1 3Ts, and as it is said: ''nln 1t1P nY l ?3 1 1 N2n M 1 24. It would have been well for him if he had kept silence, and within bounds, as the pious man said: t35 sinl tvrnn 'nlnn nt Dn orDn3 5. This was perhaps the reason why the older heretics, such as Anan, Benjamin, and others like them, never attempted to base their polemics against the Rabbanites and the Sages upon the Mishna and the Talmud, because they (the old Karaites) knew that all works ought to be understood according to the spirit of their author, but not according to the interpretation of their oppo- nents; for they (the authors) themselves understand their own words and their meaning better than anybody else. And now this newcomer (Ibn Sakaveihi) appears, and aspired after things which his predecessors never attempted, and took his associates, the heretics, for altogether ignorant men 6. For he gave them a broken reed, and tried to persuade them that it was a weapon. I shall expose all this, and by doing so the truth will shine forth, that which is worthless will be set aside, and the indignation of 1 Tosefta, ed. Zuckermandel, Sabbath i, 23 (p.

We pray to God to assist us in everything which brings us nearer to his truth. The chapters (Gates) in which this man collected quotations from the Mishna and the Talmud are ten in number. I shall first men- tion their headings, and then examine every chapter, and point out his errors wherever he thought to have found contradictions in the Rabbinical writings. The first chapter is headed, On the Unity (of God); the second chapter (fol. 2 b), On a part of the Sabbath-laws, namely, the lighting of light; the third chapter, On another part (of the Sabbath-laws), namely, irrigation 2; the fourth, On the fixing of the month; the fifth, On the rule MnDD ' K ; the sixth, On the leap-year; the seventh, On the law about fat; the eighth, On for- bidden marriages (inl'W); the ninth, On the law about menstruation (maU); the tenth: On the law regarding 'np 3l. This man asserts that the Rabbis have contradicted God's com- mands in these ten things. He is of opinion that both the oldest and the later (Rabbis) are united in that they transgress the law in reference to four of these subjects; namely, in reference to the Unity (of God), to both questions of the Sabbath-laws, and to a question of the marriage-laws; he did not therefore adduce any proofs from the Mishna and the Talmud on these points. As to the other six, he maintains that in respect to them the older (Rabbis) proceeded differently from the later, and, in order to show this, he adduces alleged proofs from the Mishna and the Talmud. He prefaces his ten chapters with strictures against the Mishna, (asking) how it was possible to say that it had come down from our teacher Moses ? But all he does is simply to deny it. I think it therefore to be expedient, before considering the six chapters, to speak about the Mishna, which is frequently referred to in these chapters. My refutation of his invectives in the first four chapters will precede my demonstration of the trustworthiness of the Mishna. In the first place, I found that this ignorant man asserted, that the Rabbis considered the Creator to be corporeal, and that they believed that he had a human form, with length, breadth, depth (thickness), limbs, and organs, and that he was provided with essential and accidental attributes. But he adduces no proof for his assertions, Prov. xxix. 8. 2 The reading of the MS. i:w2n5. (presents) is undoubtedly a corrup- tion, for afterwards two categories of the Sabbath-laws are mentioned. My conjecture :,rwn5z (irrigation) is confirmed by the above-mentioned quotation from the Tosefta.</page><page sequence="13">ANTI-KARAITE WRITINGS OF SAADIAH ~ 667 neither from the Mishna, nor from the Mechiltot, nor from the Targum; but he produces eight quotations, partly from the Agadot, partly from books the authenticity of which is not established, and partly from liturgical poetry (Chazanot, Piyutim 1). Moreover, all those passages have a figurative meaning, just as much as the analogous passages of the Bible'. I shall first set forth the sayings of the Rabbis about the denial of anthropomorphism, and then explain the anthropomorphic passages according to the analogy (?) 3 This will compel him, if he is not to fall into absurdities, to admit the indispensable 4. I say that the religion (the religious conviction) of the Rabbis is the complete negation of anthropomorphism, this is proved by their saying in the Mechilta to Exodus, in the inter- pretation of ~0f)lo" Ns tl'y N~: Sn ly N ~ ;nm, ',/1 D2VNI N ~ NZn-n (IVNI) iN sn J'VYn N' 6. -Similarly, in the interpretation of the verse i' K$'l N~, that the Creator has no similitude with anything among the minerals, plants, animals, stars, with the wind or with anything visible.

I hope, on another occasion, to dwell more at length on the importance of these fragments for Karaism, for lite- rary polemics of those days, and for Saadiah's activity as a scholar. I shall then communicate and discuss a second fragment, which, I surmise, is also taken from the 3mnz rtinm, and contains some very interesting notices on the Jewish sects of the time. (Last year I communicated portions thereof to a Russian magazine.) In view of the present resurrection of so many monuments of grey anti- quity that have lain forgotten in Oriental Genizoth, it is to be expected that our particular branch will also be considerably enriched. May this happen soon! A. HARKAVY. PETERSBURG, Febrcuary, I90I.</page></plain_text>
