<plain_text><page sequence="1">OfLightning Rods, Prisms, and Forgotten Scissors: Potemkin and German Film Theory Miriam Hansen For David Bathrickl Let me begin with a familiar - or at least familiar-sounding - pas- sage from Walter Benjamin's defense of Battleship Potemkin: We may truly say that with film a new realm of consciousness comes into being. To put it in a nutshell, film is the only prism in which the immediate environment - the spaces in which people live, pursue their avocations, and enjoy their leisure - are laid open before their eyes in a comprehensible, meaningful, and passionate way. In them- selves these offices, furnished rooms, bars, big-city streets, stations, and factories are ugly, incomprehensible, and hopelessly sad. Or rather, they were and seemed to be, until the advent of film. The cin- ema then exploded this prison-world with the dynamite of its fractions of a second, so that now we can set off calmly on journeys of adven- ture among its far-flung debris.2 1. David and I have been friends and collaborators for about three decades. Geo- graphy, work pressures, and health problems have made it increasingly difficult for us to continue our conversation. I offer these thoughts to David on his seventieth, in the hope that we can resume this conversation before too long, on one continent or another. 2. Walter Benjamin, "Reply to Oscar A. H.

The controversies and battles surrounding the German release of Potemkin - a cut version premiered in Berlin on April 29, 1926 - are fairly well documented, from its place in the annals of censorship and of anti- Communist and anti-Semitic propaganda to the film's enormous public and commercial success and galvanizing effect on German leftist film culture.3 What I would like to revisit here is the common, though under- explored, assumption that the film also galvanized debates on political art and film aesthetics. Rather than attempting a comprehensive over- view, I will take a selective but closer look at how the critical reception of Potemkin transformed key terms mobilized in these debates. Two terms in particular recurred in negative responses to Potemkin (to the extent that they were not simply inflammatory condemnations): the issue of Tendenzkunst or tendentious art, and that of collective art. Posi- tive responses to the film engaged the issue of collectivity in different ways, and took up the charge of tendentiousness by demonstrating how the film's political and aesthetic objectives were inextricably entwined. These arguments revolved in part around the question of montage, but also aimed at the nexus of cinematic technique and technological modernity at large. The notion of Tendenzkunst has a long and complex history (not just in Germany), oscillating as it does between, on the one hand, a program- matic valorization of partisan, class-conscious art in socialist cultural politics and, on the other, a term of opprobrium wielded in the name of allegedly universal and timeless aesthetic values. As is well known, however, the conceptual polarization of tendency and art was not lim- ited to belated invocations of classical bourgeois aesthetics on the part of conservative or liberal critics; it also marked important faultlines in debates on politics and aesthetics on the left. Suffice it here to mention the controversy on Tendenzkunst (a.k.a. Sperber Debates) which took 3.

If in these media the charge of tendentiousness amounted to an all-round rejection of the film, the trade press offered a slightly more liberal variant on the theme, informed by the form-content dichotomy of idealist aesthetics. Thus Georg Viktor Mendel, writing for the Berlin journal Kinemathek, called Potemkin an "undeniably [. . .] very great work of art," a must see for "our artists and technicians," but considered its artistic value marred by its avowed political tendentiousness. Echoing the censors' argument, Mendel warned that the film will bring "unrest to cinema audiences who are merely looking for pleasant entertainment." He rejects the film ("just as we rejected monarchistic and military films") because it turns "the movie theater [... .] into a political battleground."6 By contrast, publications on the left, especially Communist publica- tions such as Die Rote Fahne and Film und Volk but also the Vorwarts, hailed Potemkin for demonstrating the compatibility of political ten- dency with high artistic quality. Eisenstein himself responded to the negative attacks by turning the tables on Tendenz, and he does so in two 4.

In an interview in the Berliner Tageblatt (7 June 1926), he asserts that tendentiousness - "a clear idea of the why and wherefore of a film" - is prerequisite to the creation of any film. "We whip up the pas- sions of the audience and we must therefore provide them with a safety- valve, a lightning-conductor, and this lightning-conductor is tendentious- ness." In addition to this (in the widest sense) aesthetic argument, he pinpoints the unspoken class privilege in the charge of tendentiousness. Films that presumably avoid taking a position for the sake of 'mere' entertainment are all the more complicit with things as they are: "lack of tendentiousness seems to me merely to reinforce the tendentious view that people are leading a glorious and contented existence."7 In the months following the film's German release, Potemkin contin- ued to serve as a lightning rod, not only for audiences but also for cul- turally conservative critics. Oscar A. H. Schmitz, a playwright and essayist on the fringe of the George circle, rejected the film from a humanist, antimodernist position, on both aesthetic and political grounds. In "Potemkinfilm und Tendenzkunst" [Potemkin and tenden- tious art] (the article that occasioned Benjamin's polemical response), Schmitz attributes the alleged artistic failure of the film not simply to its political tendency but to its self-proclaimed status as a collective work. Whatever its technical merits, he argues, the film's emphasis on the col- lective "banishes it not only from the realm of artistic interest but of truly human interest."8 The human is equated with the individual (refer- ring less to the film's mode of production and reception than to a narra- tional focus on individual fate), which alone can oppose the predictable collective processes ordained by capitalist mechanization. Against Eisenstein's reduction of individual characters to bourgeois types - the ship's captain and officers, the doctor, "sadistic oppressors of the peo- ple" - Schmitz extols recent works critical of the bourgeoisie, such as John Galsworthy's Forsyte Saga and Sinclair Lewis's Babbitt, which allow the reader sympathetic, individual access to the critically por- trayed protagonists. Against a bourgeois form of living that has become sterile and preposterous, he concludes, the road to redemption can only be sought through "individual introspection and inner renewal" - "not 7. S.

I begin with the paean to Potemkin by well-known stage and film critic Herbert Ihering, whose reviews were reputed to represent "the progressive, democratic spirit of the young republic."l0 In two reviews published in the Berliner Borsen Courier shortly after the film's pre- miere, Ihering hails Potemkin as a "people's film" [Volksfilm], the most "perfect expression of a world," equal to Chaplin's Gold Rush; both films mark "the poles of film art" - "Russia-America." Germany, he argues, has produced a few excellent films but not a "people's film," because "we are politically, spiritually, and artistically torn."11 He goes so far as to award Potemkin the status of an epic masterpiece - the identity of the individual director is "almost irrelevant" - a work that combines technical perfection with the expression of a worldview: "If Battleship Potemkin were the only document to survive from the past twenty years, we would have preserved a witness-bearing, lasting [giiltig] human work, like the Iliad, like the Nibelungenlied."l2 (Refer- ring to this assertion, Oksana Bulgakova wryly adds that Goebbels "demanded a National Socialist Potemkin in 1934.13) In other words, the idea of collective art is made acceptable by nationalizing, de-politi- cizing, and de-historicizing the collectivity at stake. To be fair, Ihering's prescient review goes beyond cliches about national masterpieces. He not only praises the film's "documentary power" and "monumentality of objectivity," but takes us through the 9. Schmitz 518. Schmitz's conclusion is eerily echoed, if modified, in the last sen- tence of Adorno's 1938 essay "On the Fetish Character of Music and the Regression of Listening" (1938), in The Essential Frankfurt School Reader, ed. Andrew Arato &amp; Eike Gebhardt (New York: Urizen Books, 1978): "In music, too, collective powers are liquidat- ing an individuality past saving, but against them only individuals are capable of con- sciously representing the aims of collectivity (298). 10.

For the most part, Ihering offers a perceptive, empathetic ekphra- sis, with a remarkable degree of sensitivity to composition and sequencing ("brilliant how we are shown the folding of a parasol, a pair of elegant feet; suddenly, a hunchback appears in the picture"). His ana- lytical categories, however, remain those of traditional art and literary criticism, with little or no attention given to cinematic technique and style, nor to the film's mediation of aesthetic and political concerns. It is precisely the question of aesthetic specificity, of Potemkin as much as of the cinematic medium, that is at stake in the famous contro- versy between Bel1a Balizs and Eisenstein. Revolutionary activist, librettist, screenwriter, and leading figure among left-wing Weimar intellectuals, Balizs had been reviewing films for Viennese and Berlin dailies since 1922, and had written articles on film in, among other pub- lications, Die Rote Fahne, Die Weltbiihne, and Filmtechnik; his first book on film, Der sichtbare Mensch, oder Die Kultur des Films [The Visible Human, or the Culture of Film] appeared in 1924.14 Balizs's only detailed commentary on Potemkin at the time appeared in his arti- cle "Productive and Reproductive Film Art" (Filmtechnik, 12 June 1926), based on a lecture, "The Tradition and Future of Film," which he had presented to the German Club of Cinematographers. Eisenstein responded to this text, or the lecture version, in two articles later col- lated under the title "B61a Forgets the Scissors."15 Balaizs tries to square the issue of - aesthetic, political, technologi- cally based - collectivity posed by Potemkin with his physiognomic poetics of film, which is predicated on the individual mimetic capacity to invest nature with meaning. "Crucial to Balizs's thought," Gertrud Koch observes, "is the notion that film gives visual shape to a physiognomic 14.

Such an understanding of film, indebted to the legacy of Romanticism and Leb- ensphilosophie or vitalism (in particular Simmel and Bergson), entails an anthropological, if not anthropomorphic dimension; but, as Koch argues, this dimension does not reduce to Balkzs's alleged fixation on the actor.16 In the article on Potemkin, as elsewhere, Balkzs locates the deci- sive moment of physiognomic expression in film at the level of the shot, in the creative work of the camera. Film can become art only when "photography" serves a "productive," rather than merely "reproductive," function - "when the final and decisive creative expression of spirit, soul, and emotions arises not from acting and staging but only through photographic framing [Aufnahme] in the film images themselves."17 Originally addressed to an audience of cinematographers, Balizs's argument aims at distinctions and possibilities within the conception of the cinematic shot. To begin with, he distinguishes the "special artistic value" of the cinematic shot from the merely "decorative beauty" of compositions emulating the pictorialist tradition - a style that centers and stabilizes the shot into a self-enclosed unit, thereby removing it from the flow of appearances and resulting in a staccato series of tab- leaux vivants.18 By contrast, Balhzs asserts, in the language of Lebens- philosophie, "the essence of film art consists in seizing the moving rhythm of the flowing flood of the phenomena of living life." And the ability of filmic images to do so rests exclusively with the methods and possibilities of photography.19 15.

The first shows the enthusiasm of the people of Odessa by means of "the rhythmically increasing grouping of the masses." "How could one possibly express more enthusiasm, joy and bliss?" But then comes the second, "magnificent image that drowns out all previous ones like an ecstatic song: the sail boats flying toward the battleship." This second image exemplifies for Balizs how the phys- iognomic capacity of individual experience [Erleben] achieves - or, in vitalist terms, regains - its collective dimension. At the level of the story, they are carrying food to the sailors. But at the level of the image, they seem to carry all hearts to them. In this delicate winged flight of hundreds of billowing sails the image evokes a collec- tive gesture [Gruppengebarde], which expresses more joy, love, bliss, and hope than the individual face of even the greatest actor might do. This shot - the shot rather than the visual motif - is overflowing with exuberant lyricism, with a metaphoric and poetic force incompa- rable to any written poetry. In this hidden figurative force of the images [.. .] resides the poetic-creative potential of the cinemato-grapher.20 If we hadn't seen the film, we wouldn't know that the "two shots" Balizs describes are actually a whole series of shots - a montage sequence of fourteen shots that precedes the massacre on the Odessa Steps. Without mentioning Balizs by name, Eisenstein analyzes this "randomly" chosen sequence in great detail in an essay of 1934.21 It serves him to "demonstrate," as he had done in other contexts, "the com- positional interdependence of the plastic aspect of the changing shots" (W 290), or, in a more structuralist formulation, the theory that "mon- tage is the syntax for the correct construction of each particular frag- ment of the film" (W 287). Accordingly, the individual shot is conceptualized as a "montage cell," based on compositional principles of conflict and collision both within and in relation to other shots.22 It is Balizs's failure to understand this compositional interdependency of shot and montage that Eisenstein pinpoints in his polemical response of 1926. Eisenstein links this alleged failure with the inability of Western bour- geois-individualist thinking to understand "the idea that a film is the 20. Ibid. 21. Eisenstein, "'Eh!'

He considers Balizs's rhetorically motivated effort to establish the camera- man as "star" as symptomatic of his effort to ground an aesthetics of cinema in the individual shot: "The shot itself as 'star."' Against this "personification of cinema in the individualised shot," Eisenstein pro- claims: "We must look for the essence of cinema not in the shots but in the relationships between the shots just as in history we look not at individuals but at the relationships between individuals, classes, etc." (W 79). Balizs's omission of a second "defining 'instrument of produc- tion': the scissors" ultimately dooms his effort to locate cinematic expressiveness in the work of the camera. "The expressive effect of cin- ema is the result of juxtapositions. It is this that is specific to cinema" (W 80). By ignoring this aspect of cinematic specificity, Eisenstein charges, Balaizs's account of how the image of the flying sailboats evoke a collective expressive gesture ends up relying on the "symbol- ism" of the referent, the simultaneous movement depicted, and not, as Balizs claims, on creative mediation by the photographic lens. Eisenstein had a point, to be sure, at least regarding Balas's failure to understand the significance of montage for this particular sequence from Potemkin and, for that matter, the rest of the film, as much as for the revolutionary (in both aesthetic and political senses) possibilities of cin- ema.23 But, as David Bathrick suggests, Eisenstein's dismissal of Balaizs relates to a more general difference in their notions of "film language": on the hand, a formalist/structuralist conception modelled on analogies with verbal, in particular written language (ideogram, hieroglyphics); on the other hand, a more metaphoric sense of language aiming at an expressive alternative to a verbal language that has been reduced to cog- nitive and instrumental functions.24 Moreover, what Eisenstein on his part fails to see (and, if he did, probably resented as much as Balizs's "unpleasant" terminology), is the careful distinction and dialectical rela- tion Balhzs establishes between shot [Aufnahme] and image [Bild]. For it is only through photographic framing or mise-en-cadre, that is, fragmen- tation and defamiliarization of an object or scene (in distinction to the picturesque tableau) - in conjunction with other, similarly fragmented 23. Balizs sought to amend this shortcoming in Der Geist des Films (The Spirit of Film; 1930), Schriften 2:82-93 &amp; passim. 24.

Both struggled, with varying success, to disaffiliate themselves from the biologically and racially grounded universalism underlying the vital- ist image (especially in Klages and Jung) and tried to theorize and histori- cize the collective subject of image/film experience in Marxist terms. Earlier and less equivocally than Benjamin, Balhzs opened up, in Bathrick's words, "the possibility of exploring noncognitive, psychic dimensions of human experience" - not only as a corrective to the functionalist-structuralist orientaton of the leftist avantgarde, but as "part of a systematic theory of the media."28 By emphasizing the physi- ognomic potential of film, Balazs articulated an important strand in film aesthetics, contemporary with French filmmakers and writers such as Jean Epstein and Louis Delluc (in particular the notion of photogenie) and prefiguring similar arguments in Kracauer and Benjamin. This physiognomic strand in film theory provides a point of departure for a cinema aesthetics in which the interplay between film and viewer is less predetermined than, say, in Eisenstein's concept(s) of montage.

It takes on a subject that is real, it refers to a truth that should matter. [. . .] The film does not repress anything. A miracle, it allows the klieg lights to stay aimed on the struggle of the oppressed against the oppressors. It shows a moment of revolution (S 6.1:234). This positivization of truth (as something immanent that can and should be represented) signals the beginning of a shift in emphasis from Kra- cauer's earlier theorizing of film as a medium capable of capturing the negativity of history (modernity's irreversible dissociation of truth and reality), and a concomitant valorization of experimental techniques and non-naturalistic genres such as the detective film, fairy tale and adven- ture films, toward the more specific critique of ideology he was to wage in the final years of the Weimar republic and beyond - against the increasing proliferation of escapist and reactionary films such as the Fridericus Rex series, operettas, "[high-] society films", and sentimen- tal social problem dramas.30 But Kracauer's subsequent description of Potemkin demonstrates that this shift need not entail a loss of aesthetic acuity. The charge of Ten- denzkunst in the name of "formal-aesthetic" criteria, Kracauer argues, is beside the point. The greater authenticity that distinguishes Potemkin, and "the propagandistic services that the film fortunately renders," does 29.

He begins to establish the film's artistic achievement in language familiar from his earlier writings on film (as well as his late Theory of Film [1960]). "Mr. Eisenstein may be the first to have used the means of film to represent a reality. He sticks to the surface which offers itself to the cranking camera; he does not illustrate texts, he rather confines himself to lining up optical impressions" (S 6.1:235). Then the argument takes a remarkable turn: But who is doing the associating here? An imagination [Phantasie] filled with indignation, terror, and hope which revolves around a goal and is certain about things it knows. It perceives the mechanical movements of the Cossacks' legs and flies over the faces of the crowd and rests on a baby carriage. In its eyes, the people of Odessa and the large staircase are fused into an inextricable unity, the throng of human beings on the pier seems never-ending. Stirred by the cause, this imagination jumbles the sailors' bodies around, glimpses human shadows through iron grids, stretches the endless cannons across the sea. With rebellious haste it leaps from the lorgnette, the embodiment of supreme power, to the giant tower; partial things mean as much to it as the mutineers because mutiny resides in the things as well. Only in nature, perhaps, there is a brief respite: fragments of the shore unveil themselves in gentle intermediate tones, white sails are passing (S 6.1:235f.). This passage evokes both major and marginal moments of the film in cinematic terms (such as different shot scales and angles, the effect of montage), without using technical terminology. More importantly, it suggests a mimetic identification on the viewer/writer's part with physi- cal movement, not only within particular shots but in the sequencing of shots that metamorphoses one image into another, mobilizing things as well as human beings. It thus detaches the revolutionary imagination that organizes these images from the director, or any single author, and locates their transformative power in a collective subjectivity that encompasses the viewer. In addition to highlighting the pernicious harmlessness of the prod- ucts of Western capitalist film industries, Kracauer concludes, Potemkin brings into view a pathological split in German bourgeois culture's rela- tion to modernity - by virtue of showing a "matter-of-course interac- tion between human beings and technology."</page><page sequence="13">174 Potemkin and German Film Theory With us, those spheres seem separate. Where we engage in "interior- ity" [Innerlichkeit], anything having to do with machines meets with contempt. Where technology is the thing, spiritual matters are not exactly a concern. Cars travel through geographical space; the soul is cultivated in the parlor. This film does not know any such segregation. While the crew operates among inextricable pipes and levers, the crowds pray before the dead sailor's tent. No gap between expressions of reverence and the application of technological skills (S 6.1:236). Ihering, too, had remarked on the "unity of men and machines" in Potemkin. But Kracauer takes this observation past generalizations about the Russian national character to criticize bourgeois-capitalist society's failure to engage with technological modernity, instead pro- moting a restoration of inwardness and seemingly timeless, universal aesthetic and human values. Which finally brings us to Benjamin, specifically his reply to Schmitz's article on Potemkin published in the same issue of Die Liter- arische Welt in March 1927, shortly after his return from Moscow. This text is an excellent example of how Benjamin takes up key terms of the contemporary debate and subjects them to, one is tempted to say, a Brechtian Umfunktionierung or refunctioning. Engaging both the charge of Tendenzkunst and the issue of collective art, he appropriates these terms for his own project of a revolutionary aesthetics of technology, in particulat his theorizing of cinema as a "play form of second nature."31 Benjamin opens his reply with a selfconscious, almost parodistic exer- cise in the genre of polemical riposte. Schmitz's all-round attack against tendentious art - marshalling "heavy artillery from the arsenal of bour- geois aesthetics" - deserves to be answered in "plain German" [deut- sch und deutlich], which Benjamin proceeds to do with macho swagger: "Why make such a fuss about the political deflowering of art [. . .]? How long is art supposed to remain the well brought-up young lady [hohere Tochter] who knows her way around all the places of ill-repute but is supposed to have no clue about politics?" He then switches to a different register, seemingly to compete with Schmitz on the field of traditional aesthetics: "It is a truism that political tendencies are implicit in every work of art, every artistic epoch - since, after all, they are historical configurations of consciousness" (SW 2:16; GS 2:751 f.). 31.

And since "technological revolutions are the fracture points of artistic development," he continues, "it is there that the different political tendencies may be said to come to the surface. In every new technological revolution the political tendency is trans- formed [. . .] from a concealed element of art into a manifest one. And this brings us at long last to film," the "most dramatic" "among the fracture points in artistic formations" (SW 2:17; GS 2:752.). And here follows the passage with which I opened this essay. Benjamin thus derails the discourse on Tendenzkunst by inserting the term technology into the dualistic conception of art/aesthetics and poli- tics, and by defining technological revolutions - not simply political ones - as the decisive fracture points of art history.32 This shift inflects the meanings of both art and politics in the direction of Benjamin's "anthropological materialism" - the one toward a wider conception of the aesthetic as theory of sensory perception (according to "the Greeks" and, implicitly, Baumgarten), for which film at present "proves to be the most important subject matter" (SW 3:120); the other toward a theory of the political that overlays the history of modern political and social rev- olutions with a history of the human species' interaction with nature, negotiated in the medium of technology. In both these respects Ben- jamin's reply to Schmitz points forward to the 1935-36 versions of "The Work of Art in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility." I'm refer- ring here to the argument that the historic function of film is twofold: to enhance the "collective innervation" of technology, as a mimetic form of adaptation and incorporation and, more urgently, to redress the pathologies inflicted upon the human sensorium by an already "bun- gled," i.e., capitalist-imperialist, reception of technology - by render- ing human self-alienation productive and allowing for a cathartic 32. This thought was of course less uncommon in contemporary art history and the- ory, in particular the Vienna School (Alois Riegl et al.) which Benjamin read, cited and appropriated for leftist debates on the politics of art. It is in this context that Lu Mirten's work (see note 5, above) has been - and should be more thoroughly - revisited.</page><page sequence="15">176 Potemkin and German Film Theory discharge of destructive energies produced by this failed adaptation. Key to this argument are ideas for the most part excised from the more familiar 1939 version of the essay, such as the concept of innervation; the concept of film as second technology, capable of engaging with the damage done by the regime of the "first" (human sacrifice, mastery over nature) in the mode of play (experiment, repetition, interplay with nature); and, not least, the notion of Mickey Mouse as a figure of the optical unconscious.33 It is this strand in Benjamin's thinking (that we also find in One-Way Street, the 1929 essay on surrealism, and the early layers of the Arcades Project) that makes him approach Potemkin primarily from technology - as the basis of its simultaneously political and aesthetic tendency - so as to move from there to the film's collectivist dimensions. In its engagement with technology, he argues, the cinema of the Russian revo- lution compares with American slapstick comedy, which "is tenden- tious too, in a less obvious way," inasmuch as the laughter it provokes, he adds in a Bergsonian turn, "hovers over an abyss of horror": "The obverse of a ludicrously liberated technology is the lethal power of naval squadrons on maneuver, as captured without compromises by Potemkin" (SW 2:17f.; GS 2:753). Above and beyond the representation of the antinomies of technol- ogy, Benjamin posits an anti-bourgeois, anti-individualist tendency at a material-aesthetic level - in the "conspiracy [Verschworenheit] of film technique with the milieu," which he takes to be "its essential project [ihren eigentlichsten Vorwurf]." Since the spaces of the milieu are spaces of the collective, this aesthetic potential of film makes the cin- ema a site of revolutionary change: "The proletariat is the hero of those spaces to whose adventures the bourgeois moviegoer abandons himself with pounding heart because he cannot help relishing the beautiful even when it speaks to him of the annihilation of his own class" (SW 2:18; GS 2:753). Benjamin attributes the "epochal impact" of Potemkin to its 33.

In no film before has mass movement acquired a "wholly architectural, and by no means monumen- tal (i.e. Ufa-style) quality"; no other medium could render this "collec- tive in motion," could convey in it "such beauty, even of the e/motion [Bewegung] of horror and panic" (SW 2:18; GS 2:754). It is in this cine- matic innervation of the human collective (which, Benjamin asserts, is of a piece with the narrational "collectivism" excoriated by Schmitz) that film "completes the prismatic work that it began by acting on the milieu." How does Benjamin imagine this prismatic work, and in which sense is film "the only prism in which the immediate environment - the spaces in which people live, pursue their avocations, and enjoy their lei- sure - are laid open before their eyes"? In conclusion, I return to the passage cited earlier, which is better known from its almost verbatim recycling in the Artwork essay's section on the "optical unconscious" (SW 3:117). The prismatic work of film involves a double structure of technological fracture inasmuch as it refracts a world that is already, historically, shaped by heteronomous structures that have become sec- ond nature to us. "In themselves these offices, furnished rooms, bars, big-city streets, stations, and factories are ugly, incomprehensible, and hopelessly sad. Or rather, they were and seemed to be, until the advent of film" (emph. added). By enabling human beings to bring into visibil- ity, represent to themselves, their technologically altered physis, film creates a "new realm of consciousness" - or, as he would put it in the Artwork essay, it opens up a vast new field of action or "room-for-play" [Spiel-Raum]" (SW 3:127; 117, 124). By refracting the modem physis, film simultaneously transforms it: "With the dynamite of the split sec- ond," it explodes this "entire prison-world" and makes its scattered ruins available for "journeys of adventure" - in other words, for play. The prismatic work of film obviously depends upon the practice of montage, though perhaps not entirely in Eisenstein's sense. For one thing, the urban film evoked by Benjamin sounds more like a surrealist version of Dziga Vertov, whose practice of montage he extols in remarkable detail, if briefly, in a companion piece to his Potemkin text.34 For another, the fact that Benjamin resumes much of this pas- sage to illustrate his notion of an optical unconscious - the ability of 34.

Except that for Benjamin the defamiliariz- ing, shock-like procedures capable of activating this mimetic power cru- cially included the allegorizing, destructive, and transformative possibilities of montage. Benjamin's systematic focus on technology - and the conception of film as a "second technology" - led him to think of cinematic innerva- tion, too, as involving a double process: the crossing of the screen actor's physiological impulses with technological structures (such as cinematography and editing) at the level of production, and the tempo- rally displaced assimilation, incorporation of the projected film at the level of reception, on the part of a collective audience. If in the Potemkin text he is primarily concerned with the moving collective on the screen, in the Artwork essay's section on the optical unconscious, in particular the passage on Mickey Mouse (closer again to Eisenstein and much to Adorno's dismay), he permits himself to locate the cinema's constitution of collectivity in front ofthe screen, in the movie theater as public space. Viewed from the notion of an optical unconscious, whose contours partially emerge in the Potemkin text, Benjamin's political aesthetics of cinema involved a disjunctive temporality (notwithstanding the domi- nant presentism of the Artwork essay, especially in its 1939 canonic version).35 Like Kracauer (though with a significantly different slant), Benjamin locates this temporality in the indexical dimension of photo- graphically based film, which admits a moment of contingency into its mode of inscription that makes it, in Howard Caygill's words, "open to the future."36 But the transformative disjunction implied in the optical unconscious - film's ability to actualize a forgotten or repressed past and to project a different future (or, by 1936, the very possibility of 35. This disjunctive temporality is more clearly articulated in his "Little History of Photography" (1931), SW 2:507-530; 510-11, where he introduces the notion of an "opti- cal unconscious." 36. Howard Caygill, Walter Benjamin: The Colour of Experience (London, New York: Routledge, 1998). For Kracauer's notion of photographic temporality, see his essay "Photography," Frankfurter Zeitung (28 October 1927), in Mass Ornament 47-63; on the significance of photography's disjunctive temporality for film aesthetics, ibid., 62f.</page><page sequence="18">Miriam Hansen 179 imagining a different future) - can just as well be effected through the dynamics of collective reception, triggered, in the case of Mickey Mouse, by an animated, i.e. graphically produced film. We may thus assert the relevance of Benjamin's thought for the digital age; we may also argue that the significance of Charles Sanders Peirce's concept of the index for theories of the technological media cannot be reduced to an ontology of photo-sensitive materiality.37 At any rate, this is to say that the potential of cinema for at once mimetic and transformative aes- thetic practices - now more than ever in question on both technologi- cal and political grounds - is still open to the future. 37.
