The Rathore Rajput Hero of Rajasthan: Some Reflections on John Smith's The Epic of Pabuji VINAY KUMAR SRIVASTAVA University of Cambridge I Few books are exemplars of real hard work sustained over a lengthy period of time as is John Smith's The Epic of Pabuji (199 i). Starting his investigation of the scroll of cloth painting in i973, a huge structure measuring fifteen feet by four, locally termed par, before which this epic is sung by a special caste of people, lower in hierarchy, called Naik Bhopa, Smith in a span of eighteen years has accomplished a work of lasting stay in the ethnographic tradition of south Asia as well as the discipline of folklore in general. Before this book was published, he had also contributed some important papers (in 1986 and 1989) on Pabu-ji. As far as I know, it is rare that Sanskritists, which Smith is at Cambridge, pay attention to 'popular (or "non-Sanskritic") traditions' of people, and if at all they do, introdu- cing the anthropological method of fieldwork in their study, their works are still laden with Indological references and scholarship where the actual voice of people is lost in oblivion or relegated to the back seat. But it does not happen with Smith; he is not only commit- ted to listening to people's voice in its own right and place, but also provides a fair, up to date, and scholarly account of Pabu-ji's story and its role and niche in the local culture of Rajasthan. Therefore, his work is also of considerable interest to anthropologists, especially those working on the sociology of cult, popular religion, and non- literate traditions and their meanings. Approximately seventy-three percent of Smith's work is a transcrip- Acknowledgement I am thankful to John Smith for a critical reading of this paper. oo26-749X/94/$5.oo + .oo ?

The rest consists of-besides the glossary, references, and index -a very useful translation of Pabu- ji's story in the seventeenth-century Chronicle of Muhato Nainasi, popularly known as Nainasi ri Khyata, and a string of five chapters which give a rich, comparative, and analytical account of the epic and its characters, the par and the music associated with it, divergent opinions regarding the historicity of Pabu-ji, and some intelligent thoughts on how local heroes come to be deified over a period of time. The book also carries a coloured picture of the cloth painting, and its observers will be impressed by intricate figures and motifs which embellish every inch of space within its boundaries. The English translation of this epic is accompanied by an amplified version of each of these figures and motifs, its brief description, and exact location on the par. That is why the English translation occupies forty-two percent of the book. This article aims to supplement Smith's observations with those of mine on the Raikas of western Rajasthan in whose pantheon Pabu-ji occupies a central place. Smith also observes that many of Pabu-ji's worshippers are the semi-nomadic pastoral Rebaris (p. 4), but since his major preoccupation is with transcription and translation, his respondents are chiefly its singers and narrators, the Naik Bhopas. His vantage point to look at Pabu-ji is of the 'priests' (p. 6) who guard-create and transmit-what appears as 'great tradition' to its worshippers, the Raikas (or, the Rebaris). Perhaps, a brief note on the caste name of these worshippers may be relevant here. Instead of calling these people Rebari, I have preferred to call them Raika throughout my work (1989; i991; n.d.), because it is the term by which they want to be known among themselves and to the wider world. In the initial phase of my fieldwork, I was apprised by Shri Komal Kothari-the doyen of the studies on folklore and popular culture in Rajasthan, whose residence at Paota (Jodhpur) is like a sacred site for those intending to specialize on western Rajasthan- that each Rajasthani caste/community has three names. One is its usual and popular name, the second is the honorific name which either it has chosen for itself or is given by the other castes, and the third is an abusive and derogatory name (a 'teasing name') which the others generally use for it. For instance, the usual caste name of the singers of Pabu-ji's epic is Naik, they are honorifically called Bhopa (or, Bhopa-ji), and their teasing name is Thori. But, what Kothari did not tell me and I discovered in my study was that some- times the usual name of a caste may slide into the derogatory, and 590</page><page sequence="3">THE RATHORE RAJPUT HERO OF RAJASTHAN people may opt for a more 'honorific-usual' name, and this happens because each name carries with it a cultural image. Presently, the worshippers of Pabu-ji are gradually discarding the term Rebari (and the cultural image concatenated to it) and opting for Raika-etymolo- gically meaning, 'the progeny of the celestial nymph named Rai'. The proper honorific name of this caste is Dewasi ('in whom dwells the God'), which in fact is being appended as a surname by many of its educated men. Presently, the term Rebari is almost placed alongside with its derogatory name, Bhut ('ghost'), a name which perhaps acquired currency because these semi-nomads spent most of their life with their animals in jungles and the wilderness, the favourite abodes of ghosts. II To discuss Pabu-ji's cult, it is imperative to have a knowledge of the backdrop, the cultural profile of Rajasthan, in which it developed. Smith provides its brief account in the first chapter (pp. 1-3). Let me supplement it with some more information on the Rajputs, which is to be borne in mind while handling a question on the deification of Rajput warriors by lower castes. Like the other popular cultural associations-for example, between Bengal and Durga Puja, Maharashtra and the Marathas, Gujarat and vegetarianism--Rajasthan is seen both by the insiders and out- siders as the 'land of the Rajputs', the 'sons of the ruling lineages'. It is, therefore, not surprising that popular books on Rajasthan, for tourists as well as schools, carry the same description, obscuring the fact that like the Brahmins in south India, the Rajputs have always been a numerical minority. Moreover, they are not a homogenous group; there are castes in Rajasthan villages whose claim to the Rajput status is privately as well as publicly rebutted by the others. The example of the Darogas, who call themselves Rajputs, instantan- eously comes to our mind; they are regarded as the children of the concubines the Rajput princes and landlords had. Similarly, the Ravana Rajputs, included in the list of the Other Backward Classes, are far away from the image in which typical Rajputs are cast. In addition to this myth that Rajasthan is the land of the Rajputs, there is another, widely prevalent in its villages, according to which all the local castes have 'sprung up' (nikliyori) from the Rajputs. If you ask the Rajasthan villagers about the total number of castes that 59I</page><page sequence="4">VINAY KUMAR SRIVASTAVA inhabit their villages, the patent answer is 'thirty-six' (chatris quam), although they point out that no village has all of them. No unanimity exists on the list of these caste names, and each respondent churns out his own list wrestling with his memory. Powlett's (1874: I42-3) attempt to list them in Sujangarh is equally frustrating because when counted, his list has only thirty-four castes, a discrepancy which is inexplicable. All these thirty-six castes are believed to have been cre- ated out of the Rajputs; or as my respondents say, 'The Rajput essence (ansa) is in all'. My interpretation is that the number thirty-six should not be taken too literally. I think by this the people imply that there are many, very many castes. In a similar vein, the idea of many villages is conveyed by the popular concept of 'eighty-four villages' (caurasi gam). Both these ideas are like the concept of pancayat (council) which does not mean that there will be just five decision-makers. The number is not important, but the idea of a small group of elders whose authority is infallible. Let me now present the local understanding on how these 'thirty- six castes' have emerged from the Rajputs. There are two types of local belief-models which explain it. I would call the first the Raika model. Here, the starting point is the sole nuclear family of a caste, created by the God, with sons and daughters of marriageable age. The family cannot reproduce itself internally because of the incest taboo, and the search for spouses leads it to seek the reproductive and procreative services of the Rajputs. Why the Rajputs, whose fall in the caste hierarchy is augured by the practice of exogamy and hypogamy, agree to help the other lower castes is explained in terms of one or the other divine command. For instance, in the Raika myth, Lord Siva orders the Rajput king (of Patan or Jaisalmer, and this varies according to different variants of the myth) to spare twelve Rajput warriors from his army for the twelve daugh- ters of the first Raika couple comprising a man created from the divine body and a celestial nymph named Rai. Though the Rajput warriors are excommunicated from their respective sub-castes, they perform their righteous duty (dharma ra kam) of procreating another caste. The second may be called the Gola model (see Cohn 1987: 244). The terms gola (and feminine, goli) are used for the children of the concubines from their Rajput masters. In the present context, both these terms are pejorative, and this perhaps derives from the practice, 592</page><page sequence="5">THE RATHORE RAJPUT HERO OF RAJASTHAN extant in some parts of the erstwhile western Rajasthan princely king- doms, of sending golas and golis-as servants and concubines and maid-servants respectively -as part of the dowry of the full-legitimate daughter of a Rajput couple. The rigidity of the marriage choices observed at the level of the full-legitimate children lapsed into laxity at the level of the half-legitimate progeny; in other words, the mar- riage rules for the progeny of concubines were, quite expectedly, less clear. It is believed that many lower castes emerged from the mar- riages between golas (and golis) and the unspecified others; put in another way, the lower castes, although structurally far away from the Rajputs, carry in them the Rajput ansa, the quintessence. Thus, unsurprisingly, the lower castes produce a list of their sub-caste or clan names (khanpa) where many of them are actually of the Rajputs. The difference between the following two claims may be noted here: (i) 'all castes have sprung up from the Rajputs'; and (2) 'we are the Rajputs'. When some groups of the Girasiyas of south Rajas- than claim that they are the 'Rajput Girasiyas', they are not forging kinship with the ruling Rajput clans of their or neighbouring states, but are creating a distinction within themselves-the total caste of the Girasiyas -between those who are higher (having a larger essence of the Rajputs) to those lower (with a little Rajput essence). The belief that all castes have emerged from the Rajputs does not imply equality between them, but fosters a sense of unity in Rajasthan, which can now be precisely defined as the 'land of the Rajputs and the thirty-six castes which have sprung up from them'. The ruling class Rajputs, whether in towns or villages, held some kind of a dominion over their style of life and cultural practices, and anyone daring to adopt and display them ignited their wrath; for instance, there are stories of the non-Rajput bridegrooms being pun- ished by them for mounting the mare. To use Marriott's (1976) words here, which he actually used for the Banias, these Rajputs were also 'minimal transactors' in the cultural sense. They kept themselves aloof from their subjects, and in fact, as I learnt in my fieldwork, the Ravalas, the collective noun for the palace or the housing complex where the Rajputs lived, were quite enigmatic to the commoners who kept on wondering as to what transpired in them. The stories of oppression unleashed by the Rajput kings and landlords abound all over Rajasthan, and even now, such cases are not entirely unheard. I have argued elsewhere (n.d.) that in the moral hierarchy-which exists independently of the hierarchies built upon the facts of eco- 593</page><page sequence="6">VINAY KUMAR SRIVASTAVA nomy, power, and status-the Rajputs are classed as zalim, the mean- ing of which is roughly conveyed by words like 'cruel' and 'oppressive'. The sole redemptive feature of the Rajput's image is not 'compas- sion', the characteristic of a king modelled on the example archetyp- ically set by Lord Rama, the king of Ayodhya. But, the warrrior's image is at the core of a Rajput role. Thapar (1982) points out that the Kshatriyas-and the Rajputs are included in this varna category- though included in the asrama (vocation) curriculum for the twice- born castes, have their own ideals defining life (purusartha) in which heroism is at the centre. Therefore, certain cultural practices-like non-vegetarianism, worship of the mother goddess depicted in a fierce form, and blood sacrifice-were inalienable from the warrior's image. In later times, even when the meaning of Kshatriya 'changed from warrior to land-owner and gift-giving became as important as pro- tecting, heroism remained an aspect of the ideal Kshatriya function' (Thapar I982: 277). Thus, in the Kshatriya model, salvation (gati, mukti) does not follow from the pattern of Brahmanic renunciation, as the theory of four asramas expounds, but from death in the battlefield, defending the people and property, because in this way a Kshatriya conforms to his purusartha. Should his wife follow him to death, by ritually performing sati, she was 'ensured a place in heaven'. These ideals have survived till today, forming a part of the people's descrip- tion of their self (Harlan I992), although the 'protecting function' of the Rajputs has now been taken over by a modern democratic state. It is natural for a king cast in the model of a 'compassionate being' to evolve into a renouncer and become a part of the people's religious complex. And, it is equally natural for a king cast in the 'warrior's role' to evolve into a protector-deity. A renouncer-deity has a wider scope, ensuring not only long-term welfare, but also salvation. As a protector-deity, its scope may be just confined to pragmatic concerns of life. Though analytically separable, the roles of a 'renouncer' and a 'warrior' may in fact fuse, and this is exactly the Kshatriya alternat- ive to the Brahmanic perspective. Pabu-ji's story-episode exemplifies it-the fusion of the warrior and the renouncer-and this would explain why he cannot be exclusively seen in the model of a brigand, or a simple protector-deity, as Smith says (pp. 89-99). I shall return to this point later. 594</page><page sequence="7">THE RATHORE RAJPUT HERO OF RAJASTHAN III Instead of recapitulating Pabu-ji's story here, which is succinctly pre- sented by Smith in the first chapter (pp. 9-12), let me identify some of its salient points which also explain why he is still remembered and venerated by people, especially the Raikas, and then I intend to look into the narrative strategies adopted in Rajasthan both by the professional singers and people. Pabu-ji was a Rathore, one of the ruling Rajput clans, who prob- ably lived in the early fourteenth century A.D. But, this belief in itself is not enough. What is central to his deification is that he is thought to be an incarnation of Lakshmana, the younger brother of Lord Rama. Smith's chief respondent, Parbu Bhopa, the narrator of the epic transcribed in this book, linked Pabu-ji's story with the Sanskritic myth of Rama's existence, pointing out that the battle at Lanka left many unfinished businesses, and to accomplish them, both the god and the demon-king returned to the battle-ground, the earth. The poetic justice was met with the demon's final and imminent exterm- ination; the god fulfilled all his vows and left for heaven, unblemished and leaving nothing unfinished (pp. 92-3). I use the word 'unblem- ished' because this time the god does not incur any 'sin', like the Ramayana story where Lakshmana cuts off the nose of the demon king's sister, thus accumulating demerit, and to repent for it he has to return to the mortal world. In the local tradition, Pabu-ji's story, thus, becomes an appendix to the Ramayana, but this time its hero is Lakshmana, not Rama. The point here is that the demotic stories take the form of epics when they coalesce with the great tradition and become its part. But, being appended to the great tradition as a result of the local efforts does not mean that these stories and the heroes figuring in them also become pan-Indic. In fact, Pabu-ji's story challenges the merging of the concepts of 'great tradition' and 'Sanskritic Hinduism', as one comes across in the works of Milton Singer (1972) and others. These two concepts are not identical (Fuller I992: 25), and their merging at one level breaks down at another. A great tradition may be roughly conceptualized as 'tasseled' to which the stories of the little tradition are tied without their basic theme being altered. Looking from the perspective of the actual bearers of the great tradition, historians, and ethno-historians, this process of attaching local stories to the 'tassels' of great tradition is a fine example of what Smith terms the 'inflation of history' (p. 73). However, from the perspective of people, it is an 595</page><page sequence="8">VINAY KUMAR SRIVASTAVA attempt towards the greater unity of traditions. Inflation of history may be disturbing to historians, but the aim of people is not to create history, rather a timeless unity of traditions. When Devnarayan-ji, Ramdeo-ji, Karni Mata, Pabu-ji, and many other local deities, are seen as the incarnations of whom we call Sanskritic and pan-Indic gods and goddesses, the same idea of a timeless unity of traditions is reiterated. And, at the latent level it reinforces the quintessence of Hinduism that gods and goddesses are not remote from human life. They are amidst all, and whenever their worshippers are in difficulty, they are reincarnated but not necessarily in an anthropomorphic form. The example of Pabu-ji's mare, an incarnation of a celestial nymph, may be remembered here. My Raika respondents emphasized the divine status of Pabu-ji in the belief of his being, like Lakshmana, eventually an incarnation of the serpent-king, Sesnag, on whose hood stands the earth and on whose coiled body rest the divine couple of Visnu and Lakshmi. But, when worshipping or remembering, do they see him as Lakshmana or the hero who sacrificed his life for 'human welfare'? It is perhaps the latter image in which he is seen. In other words, Pabu-ji remains Pabu-ji; his identity is not seen as disappearing in the identity of his primordial form (Sesnag or Lakshmana). Moreover, he has a special meaning for the Raikas because he not only brought 'reddish-brown she-camels' (rati dhauli sand) to Marwar, but also assigned their caste the duty to breed and graze them. According to this story, the Raikas became camel-breeders from that day, and later acquired the reputa- tion of 'camel-riding messengers' (Westphal-Hellbusch 1975: I26) and 'postmen' (Sharma i970: i66). In many Hakumat ri Bahi ('the books of administration') I consulted in the Bikaner archive, there were many entries in them of the Raikas receiving awards and laurels for bringing in messages and turbans of princes and warriors killed in battlefields. A similar instance comes in Pabu-ji's story (p. 12). In addition to the above identified two reasons-an incarnation of Lakshmana and the warrior who brings camels-which support Pabu-ji's worship, the third deals with the annihilation of demons and their forms. When Pabu-ji rounds up the she-camels, he is stopped by the demon-king Ravana's soldiers. He embattles with them valiantly, finally spearing Ravana to death. In another episode dealing with the family feud between the Rathores and the Khicis -the latter sym- bolizing demons in this context-the latter's army is completely destroyed under Pabu-ji's direction, but when one of his courtiers is about to strike a fatal blow on the leader of the Khicis, Jindrao, he 596</page><page sequence="9">THE RATHORE RAJPUT HERO OF RAJASTHAN stops him from doing it because the Khici happens to be his sister's husband. On another occasion, Jindrao is face to face with him in the battlefield, but even then he decides not to kill him and in fact hands over his sword to his enemy. On both these occasions, he gives jivan dan ('donation of life') to his arch-enemy because he does not want to accumulate the demerit of widowing his sister, and instead prefers to be struck by his own sword brandishing in his foe's hand. Being divine, at this moment, he is carried away by the heavenly palanquin. His departure is avenged by his brother's son, Rupnath-ji (also called Jhardo-ji). IV Scenes from Pabu-ji's story are painted on a huge piece of cloth called par. Except for the time of performance, it is kept rolled from left to right, an unexplained convention (p. 8). During the day, my observa- tion is, it can be unfurled and erected-but never spread on the floor, its characters explained and the story told to interested observers and listeners. The performance before it, however, takes place after nightfall, concluding usually at the crack of dawn. The pars are created by painters (citero) ofJosi caste, mostly settled in southeast Rajasthan (p. 66). Smith also points out that some of them are painted by the Naik Bhopa themselves, the narrators of the story (p. 6); however, I did not come across any such instance. Fur- ther, he says that they are bought by the Bhopas and may also be 'sold to the tourist emporia' (p. 6). And, citingJames Tod (p. 6), he characterizes these Bhopas as itinerant who travel from one village to another with their 'temple', an euphemism for the par. My observation on these points is slightly different. Although the Naik Bhopas were not a part of my study, they invariably figured in the context of relations the Raikas have with the other castes. Of all the patron-client relations (not absolutely in the sense ofjajmani ties where the agriculturalists are at the centre and can afford a hereditary system of payment in kind at the time of harvest) where the Raikas are at the centre, the most important one is with the Naik Bhopas. It may be noted here that the Raikas are not entirely nomadic. They have fixed hamlets-usually called dhani and infrequently, bas-which are outside the main village and where they return after the grazing expedition (dhang) to other parts of Rajasthan and neighbouring states. The grazing expedition, which is a function of the size of herd 597</page><page sequence="10">VINAY KUMAR SRIVASTAVA and the availability of vegetation and fodder in their area, generally commences after the Festival of Lights (Diwali) and the herds return home before the onset of monsoon (mid-June). The Raika dhanis, at any point of time, are populated by old men; those men who have small herds and find the local vegetation optimum for their animals; and women and children. In a nutshell, a Raika dhani is by and large a settled unit. A Raika dhani, as the name suggests, is demographically smaller, in relative terms, and comprises a few extended families of the same caste. But, on the periphery of such a homogenous settlement, some- times one meets a couple of the Naik Bhopa families, and when invest- igated, it is disclosed that they were especially settled by the Raikas who made the land available to them for habitation. In Desuri-Sadri (south Pali), I learnt that even when the Bhopas do not share the dhani with the Raikas, the latter are their principal patrons, because Pabu-ji has a special reverential value for the latter, as was said previously. An important dimension of this patron-client relationship is that the pars are gifted to their narrators by the local Raika com- munity with money jointly raised. The Raika caste council (pancayat, thikana) may also sanction money, collected by it as fine from erring members, for buying a new par. The names of the patrons-usually the name of the dhani-and the date of purchase are recorded on the lower corner of its right side just below the scene where Buro-ji (Pabu-ji's brother) and Saragde Khici (Jindrao's father) dispute over the hare. A Bhopa of Desuri told me that the pars are mostly inherited and they are sturdy enough for several decades. Once they show the signs of wearing out-like, their colours fade or crack and the figures become less clear-the Raika patrons themselves realize that they need to be replaced, or the Bhopa may approach them with the request of a new par. According to him, his caste members would rarely have sufficient savings for a new par. Smith also notes this (p. 67). I want to reiterate two points which follow from the preceding discussion. First, the Naik Bhopas are not itinerant, in the sense of free-lance 'priests' or 'entertainers', travelling with their 'mobile temple', who give their performance wherever they like or serve anyone approaching them. Moreover, par-narration (par bancna) is not their sole occupation in contemporary times. Most of them have sought quasi-employment in small factories, like brick-kiln (bhatta), or work in marginal sectors of the economy. Some of them practice agriculture. But, in months-after the Festival of Colours (Holi) till the winter-harvest (in April) and after Goga Naumi (in August) till 598</page><page sequence="11">THE RATHORE RAJPUT HERO OF RAJASTHAN the monsoon-harvest (in October) -when holding par-narration is thought to be rewarding and auspicious, they keep themselves free and are always home. At other times, if a patron wants to organize such a performance, they return from wherever they have gone out to work. Second, the sociological aspects of par-narration and their special- ists become clear when looked at from the point of view of their patrons, who venerate the deity, the pivot of narration, and celebrate their faith in him by organizing an all-night performance. As said earlier, Pabu-ji is the chief deity in the Raika pantheon. Other castes-both higher and lower-do believe in his existence, an idea conveyed by the local term man-na, but they do not have the same routinized cycle of his worship as there is among the Raikas. When an important occasion, referred to as 'big work' (mota kam) -like feast (mausar), marriage (parnana), return of the migratory herd -is success- fully accomplished, the Raikas organize a par-narration session in honour of Pabu-ji. In a similar way, the Gujars opt for the par of Devnarayan-ji, their caste-specific deity. By contrast, a Rajput will prefer to have an all-night devotional singing (bhajan, sangat, kirtan) in honour of one of the Mother Goddesses, or a Meghwal will arrange such a singing for Ramdeo-ji, their caste deity. None of the higher castes will generally opt for the narration of Pabu-ji's par unless there are some special reasons, and of course the Naik Bhopas do not serve the Meghwals. A distinction between caste-specific and caste-free deities may be relevant here, and it does not conflict with the idea that all castes in a village believe in the existence (man-na) of all deities irrespective of their specific caste alliances. V This leads me to the ways of narrating Pabu-ji's life. Almost all adult Raikas know the story and greatly fancy telling it to a captive audi- ence. Such narrations do not accompany any religious rituals, but leisure is a crucial requirement. Like story-telling in general, many adult men, young and old, collectively narrate it. Its different episodes (parvaras) are recapitulated not in any chronological order, but in terms of the events that have stayed in their minds, because of their appeal; hence those which actually occurred late in Pabu-ji's life, as we learn from the Naik Bhopa's narration, are recounted in the begin- ning and vice versa. If a narrator skips a segment of the story, the 599</page><page sequence="12">VINAY KUMAR SRIVASTAVA other, in the process of reminding him, takes over the rest. Whenever he falters or fails in his memory, which is natural, it is the turn of the others. Collectively they store and collectively they narrate what for them is the total story. Among the Raikas, there are men who specialize in singing these episodes which in this context are referred to as jhurave. Collectively termed Pabu-ji rejhurave (like Pabu-ji re parvare, in par-narration), these singers are called jhurave ganewale (the 'singers of the jhurave'). The lines of the jhurave are different from the par, although the underlying theme is the same. These sessions, like the par-narration, are also held at night, but unlike par, no musical instrument accompanies them. Plugging their right or left ear with one of the index fingers, the jhurava-experts sing at a loud pitch, and the audience repeats the last word of each line recited, an act called hukara dena. There are some other differences between them and the par-narrators which I shall take up a little later. The most specialized singing, one of the prime concerns of Smith, is before the par by the Naik Bhopas. The latter speak of their activity as Pabu-ji ri par bacna ('narrating Pabu-ji's par'), and the patrons, who organize and meet its expenses, call it Pabu-ji ri par bacvana ('getting Pabu-ji's par narrated'). Smith distinguishes the proper par-narration, a performance before the cloth painting by the Bhopa couple with the accompaniment of a string instrument (ravanhattho) and ankle-bells (gunghar) from mata-epic which does not take place before the par, the specialist does not dance, and the only accompaniment here is a pair of drums (mata) (p. I4). Although I have not seen the latter performance, but from Plate 2 (p. 7), which is of the mata-singers outside Pabu-ji's temple in Kolu, the village where he lived and ruled, it is clear that these 'drums' are big earthen pitchers, that is why the term mata ('made up of clay'), 'covered with a rawhide membrane' (p. I7). Compared to the par-narration, it has a restricted geograph- ical spread (p. I7). It is not uncommon to come across such mata- singers outside many temples in Rajasthan, and perhaps such singing might have evolved around the temple complexes and remained restricted to them. What does the par-narration consist of? There are two aspects to this; first, the story is 'written' on the cloth and the Bhopa under- stands its 'language'. He knows the spatial configurations that unitedly constitute the par, and organizes his knowledge accordingly. This point can be understood in terms of the organizing principle of the par which is space and not chronological linearity (p. 56). Differ- 600</page><page sequence="13">THE RATHORE RAJPUT HERO OF RAJASTHAN ent events in Pabu-ji's life take place at different points in the space; to quote Smith here: '[the par] has more in common with a road map than with a comic strip' (p. 8), and at another place, keeping the space-orientated definition, he defines the par as 'a representation of epic geography, a sort of epic map' (p. 64). During the course of narration, the Bhopa points at the pictures on the par with the bow of his string instrument, and his wife brings the lamp she holds closer to illuminate further that space. So, the first aspect is the narrator's sacred journey over the space organized in the par. Second, this 'epic map' is inalienable from its verbal description- the epic-which the Bhopa remembers by heart. He intersperses the singing (gav) with a detailed account of its 'meaning' (arthav). Often, he may introduce an analogy from modern times for generating good- humoured fun. One aspect which distinguishes jhurava-singing (and perhaps, mata-singing) from par-narration is arthav. My experience with jhurava-singers is that though they may remember hundreds of verses (kari), they find it difficult to provide an explanation. A good Bhopa is one who has mastered the skill of singing and explanation, and is thought to be competent to answer any questions. By contrast, a good jhurava-singer is one who can sing loudly, for an almost indefinite length of time, without letting his 'breath break' or 'voice crack' at a high pitch. Elements of worship (puja) constitute another distinguishing factor. The jhurava-singers, as observed earlier, do not commence their per- formance with any rituals, which is rather imperative for par- narration. Ilse Kohler-Rollefson (who was conducting a fieldwork in Rajasthan on traditional methods of camel-management) and I organized a session of par-narration (par-bacvana) in village Bhadras (Pali) (in March Ig99). Our Bhopa advised us to arrange certain ritual ingredients for the worship of Pabu-ji and the par such as oil, clarified butter, swabs of cotton (all for lamps), incense sticks, and forprasada, sugar-wafers (batasha), coconuts (naryal) and jaggery (gur). In addition, he asked us to buy some packets of bidi and cigarettes, and boxes of matches. As expected, the performance began after offering worship to Pabu-ji and the gods and goddesses, seated on the upper-most strip of the par (who are said in the narration to have descended from heaven to attend the marriage procession [jan] of Goga Chauhan, the bridegroom of Buro-ji's daughter, Kelam Bai). After the performance, the prasada was distributed amongst all, and like any other Hindu puja, the audience cupped their hands over the lamp and brought them back to caress their faces. The par-narration 60o</page><page sequence="14">VINAY KUMAR SRIVASTAVA in fact was in the paradigm of Hindu puja, not different from, say, Satyanarain Katha which is quite popular with middle classes of north India, and the Bhopa, the lower caste man, was transformed into the role of a priest. That is why, holding a devotional singing session or par-narration are structurally similar in terms of their spir- itual outcome-or, merit, and what one chooses from them depends on what is conventional in one's community. I have no idea of the mata-epics, but no ritual performance, like the one described above, was observed injhurava-singing. Organizing its sessions, by calling specialists from far-off villages, was also inter- preted by the Raikas as an act of religious merit, but lower in scale by contrast to par-narration. To summarize at this juncture. Pabu-ji's story thrives at two levels-the people's and the specialists' (like par-narrators, mata- singers, andjhurava-experts). Of the latter, thejhurava-singers are from the Raika caste, and they have developed and preserved their own tradition of singing. The people's conception of Pabu-ji's story is a result of the hybridization of different traditions that flourish in their immediate environment. Variation does exist between the people's and the specialists' conception, and not only between specialists of different traditions but also of the same, but it does not dilute the textual fixity, the uniformity both in the story and par-designing (p. 24). This prepares the ground to examine the nuances of variability, their probable explanations, and the movement towards greater uni- formity in Pabu-ji's story. VI In what terms does one narration differ from the other? Smith (p. 21) says that 'the text often devotes a seemingly disproportionate amount of attention to relatively trivial occurrences', and illustrates this with one example: 'Pabu-ji sends Cando (one of his courtiers) to fetch Deval (an incarnation of the goddess)'. A thick and dense description of Cando-ji's journey-minute details of what he wears, where he sleeps, what he watches during his way, arrival at Deval's residence, the rituals of honour for a guest, the dissemination of mess- age and its interpretations, how Deval gets ready to move, what she forgets, the journey to Pabu-ji's court (kacheri) and its details, and finally their arrival-constitutes twenty-two couplets in Parbu Bhopa's narration (p. 22). Surely, the story will not change if this is 602</page><page sequence="15">THE RATHORE RAJPUT HERO OF RAJASTHAN said in one couplet: 'Pabu-ji sends Cando to fetch Deval, and she arrives at his court', but then it will be stripped of, what I would call, the 'ethnographic flesh' in which the local listeners are as much interested as they are in the central details. In fact, the people become uneasy when the Bhopa tries to skip the ethnographic flesh, or intro- duces a little of it. In one of the narrations I witnessed in Bikaner, the Bhopa compressed the entire epic-from Pabu-ji's birth ('horoscope') to how his death was avenged by Rupnath-ji-in a single performance. Although the audience listened to a faithful account of the entire story, they still thought that a lot was ignored, and left for home grumbling, '[We] haven't enjoyed' (maja nahin ayo). Pointing out the ethnographic flesh the Bhopa had left out, one of my respondents said, 'Look at this Bhopa, he did not tell us that when Pabu-ji's arrow (ban) hit Ravana, his [the latter's] teeth started falling like grains of maize'. When a character like Dhebo-ji (also called Dema-ji) figures in the episode, the people want to hear as many stories as are possible on his gargantuan appetite, the maunds of opium he consumes at one time, his valour, and his interaction with the witches (dakan) that inhabit the borders of Lanka, because all these appeal to their humour. Similarly, the stories of Harmal Rebari (another courtier) after he has accepted the challenge (bida uthana) to bring in any news about the place where the she-camels lived, appeal to the people's paradigm of play and humour; the more the ethnographic flesh the Bhopa adds to his narration, the more is the interest he arouses in his audience and more is his performance praised. Therefore, the outsider's distinction between 'necessary' and 'unne- cessary'-or, what Smith calls 'trivial occurrences'-is unacceptable both to the narrators and people. This, however, does not refute the distinction between events central, and thus imperative, to the story and those constituted of the day-to-day details-the ethnographic flesh-with which people identify themselves instantaneously. Let me give an example here. When Bura-ji's daughter, Kelam Bai, is married to Goga-ji Chauhan, Pabu-ji promises to gift reddish- brown she-camels of Lanka to her as a wedding-gift. Kelam, accepting this verbal promise, comes to her in-laws' place where everyone expresses astonishment at Pabu-ji's gift as no one has ever seen this animal. Once when Kelam joins her husband's sisters (nand) and husband's brothers' wives (bhaujai)--real as well as classificat- ory-for a session of spinning, all these women make fun of Pabu-ji's gift, using sarcastic words, envisaging the tornado that would befall 603</page><page sequence="16">VINAY KUMAR SRIVASTAVA once the she-camels are brought to the Chauhan family. At this point, the Bhopa may introduce the ethnographic flesh dealing with the interpersonal scrimmages between brother's wife and husband's sister, and daughter-in-law and mother-in-law. Further, in the same episode, Kelam is infuriated with the bitter and sarcastic words. Throwing away her spinning wheel, she returns to her palace. The Bhopa tells us (not in Parbu Bhopa's version) that Kelam Bai is so angry that her necklace breaks; her wrap and blouse become moist with her tears. She tells her maidservant, 'Why didn't my parents kill me when I was born; why didn't they give me opium (amal) [referring to the practice of female infanticide in which live baby girls were buried with a lump of opium stuffed in their mouths]; did they bring me up to face this humiliation?' At this juncture, the Bhopa may add some more verses to verbalize the intensity of Kelam's experiences (or, for that matter, any daughter-in-law) in her in-laws' house. However, he may skip the ethnographic flesh at this point if he has already added a lot on other such sensitive contexts in the epic. Moving straight from Kelam's anger to calling her maidservant does not change the story, but to the audience, it is too bland to evoke any emotions. Unless there are verses, both evocative and emo- tional, with which the people identify themselves, which tell them their story and what would go on in their houses if such situations were to arise, the Bhopa's narration will be tasteless. The point I want to stress is that though Pabu-ji's epic has fixity, in the sense that the Bhopa does not deviate from the central episodes, he can always add an evocative description on all sensitive points, detailing out the inward experiences of the characters involved. The intensity of the characters, innately demonic or the source of good- humoured fun, may be the subject matter of appendicular stories. The narration of the entire text requires a couple of days-and, on one occasion, Ilse and I spent almost the entire night listening to the episode of the she-camels, because of its rich ethnographic flesh. Here the point is not that certain events take place, but how actually they occur. Let me illustrate it. To further the episode cited earlier, Kelam asks her maidservant to call the scribe (Kamdar) because she wants a letter (kagad) to be written to her uncle, Pabu-ji, but she does not confide this in the maidservant. When the latter gives the message to the Kamdar that he has been called to the fort (garh) by Thakur Pabu-ji's niece, he almost faints. At this point, before he leaves, he reflects upon many things. According to our Bhopa, the Kamdar's heart sinks: 'Why has 604</page><page sequence="17">THE RATHORE RAJPUT HERO OF RAJASTHAN Kelam Bai called me; does she want to punish me for any wrongdo- ing; will she ask me my genealogy, the work I had been doing?' His thoughts oscillate between the worst consequences of such a call and the objective fact that he would know the truth of the matter only on reaching the door of Kelam Bai. Sensing the delicate state of his mind, his wife gives him confidence, 'Since you have not done any- thing wrong, not even inadvertently, why are you afraid? The palaces have their own big problems (bare ghar ki bari bat). If Pabu-ji's niece assigns you five hundred pieces of work, you volunteer to do a thou- sand.' Perspiring profusely, worried, and lustreless, the Kamdar pre- sents himself before Kelam who asks him to be seated on the carpet (jajam), but he politely declines this honour because, first, he is eager to know 'what is there in Kelam's mind'. And, when she tells him to write a letter, he has a sigh of relief. This example shows that the richness of Pabu-ji's story, like many others in Rajasthan, lies in a description of how the events take place, what transpires in the minds of people, and what is the natural-and institutionally prescribed-mode of reaction to various situations. The audience, as I see, identify themselves as much with the process of hap- penings as with their end results. Thus, the thoughts that precipitate in Kamdar's mind are no different from those that would emerge in a commoner's mind when unexpectedly called by the Patwari ('Land Agent') or Mukhia ('Headman'). Similarly, the humiliation to which Kelam is put in her husband's house is no different from the story of other daughters-in-law. The ethnographic flesh is the soul of a story's richness, which people desire to be as thick as possible. The conclusion of this section is that Pabu-ji's epic may be concep- tualized as being divided into the episodes that constitute it, and the ethnographic flesh arranged all around the events that occur in each episode. The external observer may be less hesitant in classifying it as 'unnecessary', perhaps because of the insignificant bearings it has on the main story, but this certainly is not the native point of view. To reiterate, what touches the local audience is the repertoire of eth- nographic flesh. Thus, while it is true that the fact of performance- arranging one on auspicious occasions-is an important dimension, I am skeptical of Smith's observation, if not judgement, that aesthetic response (of the text as well as the people) occupies a secondary place (p. 23). Though each performance is a mechanical repetition-almost like a reflex action-for the narrator, he knows that unless he succeeds in evoking his audience's emotions and involvement, he will not only leave them dissatisfied (the idea of maja nahin ayo), but also in the 605</page><page sequence="18">VINAY KUMAR SRIVASTAVA long run may be deprived of clientele notwithstanding the relations of dependence with his patrons. To achieve that level of evocation, each Bhopa adds to his narration significant chunks of descriptions of the events, which instead of chan- ging the story, enrich its emotional quality. When the Bhopa says that after the letter has been written (by the Kamdar), Kelam takes it in her hands, and as her eyes are moist, a couple of tears drop on it, thus smudging the ink-print, he is aiming at the emotional content. It is further accentuated when Pabu-ji's courtiers discover that the letter is still wet with tears, although it left Kelam's house a couple of days ago, meaning that no wind and heat could dry her tears. Unsurprisingly, such additions may be a Bhopa's individual cre- ations, though they can always be borrowed from the others, but in all cases they fully assimilate with the text. In traditional cultures, the individuals do not author a text, rather they add their contribu- tion-the product of their individual creativity-to the already existing body of unchanging truths. That is how the devotional songs swell, that is how the traditional epics expand. VII Textual fixity does not imply the invariability of ethnographic flesh. Smith notes that textual variation is qualitatively greater in different performers, which increases if they happen to hail from different fam- ilies, accentuating further if they are from different parts of Rajasthan (p. 25). Most of these differences are confined to the evocative dimen- sions of the epic, but some of them may be a bit more central, demanding a little more attention. However, the structure of the epic does not alter qualitatively. Let me here compare some portions of the epic, I collected in Pali, with Parbu Bhopa's narration. In order to distinguish these two, I shall call my Bhopa, Pali Bhopa and Smith's, Parbu Bhopa. I shall confine this comparison to a few aspects of the episode of the she-camels because it has a special meaning to the Raikas, and it is central-meaning, requiring a lot of time and attention-in most of the performances that take place in Raika ham- lets, and since I worked with them, I have a better, and detailed, knowledge of this episode. When the Kamdar has written the letter to Pabu-ji, Kelam calls a messenger named Hardan, a Raika by caste. Parbu Bhopa suffixes 6o6</page><page sequence="19">THE RATHORE RAJPUT HERO OF RAJASTHAN and prefixes the word othi before his name (p. 147), which Smith translates as the 'camel-rider' (p. 333). The Pali Bhopa instead used the term Dewasi (their honorific caste name); he never referred to Hardan as camel-rider. In another context, he said that since there were no camels before Pabu-ji brought them to Marwar, there is no question of calling Hardan 'the camel-rider'. However, the Raikas in Lanka were camel-breeders. According to him, the Raikas in Rajas- than were sheep and goat-breeders before they were deputed by Pabu- ji to graze and breed camels. In the Pali Bhopa's narration, Hardan .travels the distance to Kolu on foot, walking briskly like peacocks. The Pali Bhopa gave a long description of what happens in Pabu- ji's court when Kelam's letter is delivered by Hardan Dewasi. Most of it is ethnographic flesh-the letter travels from one courtier to another, and none of them could muster enough courage to read it out for the benefit of all. Finally, when Pabu-ji is almost on the verge of losing his temper on the impudence of his courtiers, Dhebo-ji volun- teers to read it loudly. In the Pali Bhopa's version, Kelam reminds the Kolu court of the two promises made to her on her wedding day. One concerns the reddish-brown she-camels which Pabu-ji promised to deliver within three months and three days. The other is on Dhebo- ji's promise of a maund and a quarter of pearls from the sea. Kelam's words are: 'Pabu-ji's she-camels are grazing in Lanka, while Dhebo- ji's pearls are resting in the sea; and here I am being humiliated by my "sisters" '. Whether or not Kelam gets the promised pearls from Dhebo-ji is skipped in the Pali Bhopa's narration. The text pays full attention to the she-camels because Kelam's sisters-in-law make fun of Pabu-jis gift and not Dhebo-ji's. Now, Harmal Dewasi volunteers to bring news on the whereabouts of the she-camels from Lanka. He decides to put on the dress of renouncers so that no one could identify him abroad. Before leaving for Lanka, he goes to, according to the Pali Bhopa, the meditation-seat (dhuni) of Balinath-ji Maharaj, an ascetic, to seek his blessings. In Parbu Bhopa's narration, Harmal approaches Guru Gorakh Nath (p. 344), the founder-ascetic of the Nath order, believed to have lived in the eleventh century (p. 74). At this point, the Pali Bhopa's submission is that Balinath-ji was one of the disciples in Gorakh Nath's spiritual lineage. He was also the teacher of Ramdeo-ji, the other Rajput hero, thought to have lived in the first half of the fifteenth century (Binford 1976: 121), whose cult is extremely popular with the Untouchable castes of Rajasthan (Kothari 1982: 17-8), as well as other neigh- 607</page><page sequence="20">VINAY KUMAR SRIVASTAVA bouring states (Mathur 1961: II8). In kinship terms, Balinath-ji is said to be Pabu-ji's brother (Buro-ji)'s wife's sister's son; in other words, he is the matrilateral parallel-cousin of Rupnath-ji. Once Harmal Dewasi is initiated into the Nath renunciatory order, he submits the details of his difficult mission to his teacher, Balinath-ji, and seeks his blessings. The great ascetic gives the 'renouncer's accompaniments'-like a turban (pagri), begging-bowl (khapar), staff (ghota), gourd-container (tumbi), and each one of them is magical. He also asks Harmal to promise to follow certain prin- ciples (niyam) regarding camel-utilization once the she-camels are brought to marwar, and the Raikas are given their charge, a future happening he is able to envision. The principles Harmal promises to follow on behalf of himself and his caste are: (i) the camel milk will never be sold, and (2) it will never be processed into yoghurt and clarified butter. Although these two are said to be the pristine com- mands, some other taboos regarding the sale of camel wool and the animal were later added to this list, and they are also thought to be signed by Balinath-ji. [However, in some areas of Rajasthan, these taboos are believed to have been Ironounced by Pabu-ji (Kohler-Rollefson I992).] Since then, the Raikas say, they have been keeping all these principles. This information is not included in Parbu Bhopa's narration. The story of Harmal's stay in Lanka is extremely interesting, and my impression is that every Bhopa tries to make it more captivating by adding a lot of ethnographic flesh which speaks of Harmal's intelli- gence and the divine favour that is bestowed upon him at every step of his journey. Both Pabu-ji, the incarnation of Lakshmana, and Bali- nath-ji-and by implication, Baba Gorakh Nath-ji-are omnipres- ently there to help him in his exploits. When the Bhopa narrates this story, a lot of fun is generated among the audience by magical happenings, the benign simplicity of Lanka's camel-breeders (of whom mainly two brothers, Udo and Dudo, figure whose subcaste and that of Harmal's mother are same; both are Bhim), the tradi- tional strategy of spying, the element of doubt that figures in the minds of some Lanka dwellers about the credibility of Harmal as a holy man. When the Bhopa repeats the funny hymn (hardly religious) that Harmal chanted throughout his stay in Lanka, the crowd bursts into gales of laughter. Incidentally, it is Untha ka mingra, Bhains ka singra; Ram gatagat, Ram gatagat. The first two lines of this litany are easily translatable, 'the droppings of the camel, the horns of the she-buffalo', while the last line refers to the act of 'swallowing' 6o8</page><page sequence="21">THE RATHORE RAJPUT HERO OF RAJASTHAN (gatagat). Perhaps, they mean that Harmal has come to 'swallow' the information on the she-camels in the name of Lord Ram. The Pali Bhopa added to this episode that Harmal takes Udo and Dudo as his disciples. When he longs for Marwar, he seeks permission from them on the excuse of visiting Pushkar, the pilgrimage town in Ajmer district. His disciples request him to also offer oblation in their respective names. Harmal says that he would do it if he remembered them. To make sure that he keeps them in mind, Udo and Dudo request him to accept the gift of a she-camel. But Harmal does not want to return with the animal, because his work was just to bring the news. So, he expresses his inability to take the gift with him; he says that being an ascetic it would be impossible for him to graze the animal. At the same time he realizes that it is unethical to decline the gift of one's disciples. As a mark of his acceptance, he brands (kheng) the she-camel in the name of Pabu-ji with a red-hot stick, and by implication, the entire herd now belongs to Pabu-ji. Standing at the edge of the sea, he instructs his disciples to look after all the animals. As we move further in this episode, more differences of details and ethnographic flesh are visible between the narrations by the Pali Bhopa and Parbu Bhopa. The Bhopas in general are aware of these variations, and are often critical of, as I observed, other narrators from their caste for not including one or the other event, of whatever value. But, the point not to be missed is that they are all united as far as the central events are concerned. That Harmal goes to Lanka in the disguise of an ascetic is central, but the variability comes in the sort of events, given the limit of their happening, that take shape there. I think variability within the overall structure of textual fixity is ubiquitous to all local epics. Their specialists preserve their narrative diversity, without ever transgressing the central episodes, and thus, it will never happen that the Bhopas call a conference to unify their texts, in all minor details. Thus, each Bhopa's text is one standard example of the story. VIII Why is Pabu-ji deified by many pastoral people? Smith's thesis is that Pabu-ji should be seen in the model of a 'noble brigand' (p. 89). Parallels to his thesis are not difficult to find from the cases of dacoits and bandits, who irrespective of their status before the eyes of law, 609</page><page sequence="22">VINAY KUMAR SRIVASTAVA are venerated; he writes: '. . . the noble bandit dies at the hands of his enemies, is commemorated in heroic song, and finally achieves the status of an avatara (an incarnation)' (p. 90). Did Pabu-ji also pass through this process? It is difficult to say how Pabu-ji was regarded when he actually lived. Here, let me contrast two differing conceptions of his person, one of which will lend support to Smith's thesis. According to the Raikas, the reason for venerating Pabu-ji is not that he was a cow- rescuer, but that he brought camels to Marwar and assigned to their caste a respectable occupation. This view, however, conflicts with their theory of origin: the first she-camel was created by Parvati, the consort of Siva, and the first Raika, by Lord Siva, whose task-and this is the rationale behind his creation-was to graze the animal (Raj Marwar Census 189I: 567-8; Srivastava 99 I). Therefore, since their inception, the Raikas have been associated with camel-grazing. Now, if we follow Pabu-ji's story, the implication is that around the time he lived, the Raikas were without camels, a conclusion that questions their primordial status of camel-breeders. I often drew my respondents' attention to this contradiction. Most of them pointed out that it is not true that the Raikas were without camels at any time in their past, but what Pabu-ji brought for them was a special breed (thok), the 'reddish-brown she-camels', which lived further west from Marwar. The process of 'inflation of history' not only located camels across the sea in the south of the sub- continent, Lanka, but also painted Marwar as devoid of any camel population. The Raika opinion is supported by Shri Kothari who told me that the breed Pabu-ji brought has a reddish-brown complexion and locks of hair on the upper condyles of their hind limbs, and is chiefly confined to the Raikas of Mewar. The second opinion on Pabu-ji is of the Sindhi Muslims of Barmer district. My information of these people is based on a lengthy conver- sation I had with a history teacher (at the University ofJodhpur), Mr Jahur Khan Meher, of this community. Illuminating my knowledge of the Pabu-ji cult in Rajasthan, he said that his community believes that the 'dying camel always looks towards Lanka' (mou untha Lankaye jore). His gloss over this saying was that everyone remembers his motherland in moments of difficulty, and so it is with the camel. The Sindhi Muslims believe that the 'motherland' of camels was a hamlet (dhani) called Sairo Bagani in village Lankaye, twelve miles from Umarkot (now in Pakistan). That this dhani had camels was conveyed to Pabu-ji by a Caran (the minstrel caste). On his advice, Pabu-ji 6io</page><page sequence="23">THE RATHORE RAJPUT HERO OF RAJASTHAN DII raided Lankaye, defeated the local graziers (called Sindhis), and brought herds and herds of camels to Marwar, the description of which in the Pali Bhopa's narration was, 'when these camels were being driven to Marwar, it appeared as if thousands of Khejri trees (Prosopis cineraria) were walking'. However, Pabu-ji gifted the Caran to the Sindhis, and since then the former keep genealogical accounts of the Sindhi Muslims and the account of the battle at Lankaye. Pabu-ji emerges in the role of a brigand for the Sindhi Muslims, but that is not how the Raikas (and other castes in Marwar) would like to describe him. For them, he is a warrior who seized the animals from the 'tyrant/demonic' king of Lanka. That there is some sub- stance in the Sindhi Muslims' story is confirmed not only by the Chronicle of Muhato Nainasi, but also by Pabu-ji's story is confirmed not only by the Chronicle of Muhato Nainasi, but also by Pabu-ji's story succinctly described in the Raj Marwar Census (1891: 573-6). In the latter, there is no mention of either Lanka of the south of India or the demon king Ravana. According to it, Lankthali was a region (ilaqa) in Sindh famous for its she-camels, the breed of which was not found in Marwar. One had to cross a river (or the sea) to reach this region. It further recorded that Pabu-ji instructed Harmal, who had also accompanied the raid, not to take the she-camels of the poor, but only of the rich, a fact which further supports the 'noble brigand' theory. For crossing the sea with herds of camels, Pabu-ji spread his bow over it and cushioned it with peacock feathers. As the herds walked, the bridge of feathers came to bear their pug-marks. Since that time, it is said, there are round inscriptions on peacock feathers. The opinion on the she-camels herded to Marwar differs. The Pali Bhopa said that half of them were sent to Kelam Bai's in-laws, the other half was gifted to Harmal Dewasi. The Raj Marwar Census records that all of them were sent to Kelam, who herded some of them to the gardens of her husband's older and younger brothers' wives, perhaps to avenge her humiliation, and the rest were left in the Khejri groves and sand-dunes (dhaura) of Marwar. In contrast to the Sindhi Muslims' image of Pabu-ji, for the Raikas, he is the 'martial-ascetic', who even after his demise in the battlefield is present among the people, guiding them on all worldly affairs. Sontheimer (1989) has noted that the heroic tradition has an import- ant place among the pastoral societies. In some of them, the heroes emerge from within-for instance, the case of the Bir Babas among the Ahirs (Coccari I989: 136), whereas in the others, they are from the other castes. In the Raika case, they are mostly the Rajputs.</page><page sequence="24">VINAY KUMAR SRIVASTAVA The heroes of the Warrior caste can be conveniently grouped into two categories, notwithstanding the similarities in their iconographic representations. First, those cast solely in the model of warriors, and here we can include hundreds of protector-spirits generically called bhomia-ji (in Bikaner and adjoining districts) orjunjhar-ji (in Jodhpur and Pali). In the second category, we can place martial-ascetics. Not only are they superior to the simple protector-spirits, but also there is a qualitative difference in the ritual attitudes of people towards them. The Bhomia-jis are propitiated, the martial ascetics are revered, and thus there is a higher probability of the latter's incorporation in what may be called, following Mandelbaum (i964), the transcend- ental deities. Pabu-ji falls in the second category. Irrespective of the iconographic similarities, which Smith detects (p. 90), he is not a bhomia. His temples are present in all Raika hamlets. In fact, whenever a new hamlet is founded by the Raikas, the first thing they do is to mark a piece of land (called oran) in the name of their deities where a Pabu-ji temple is built with money jointly raised. If short of resources, they would at least build a platform (than) in Pabu-ji's name where a stone-tablet symbolizing him is erected. In these temples, Pabu-ji is seated on his divine mare. Some of his courtiers may also be present in the stone-tablet with Pabu-ji in the centre. Usually, Dhebo-ji is seated outside the temple. Two reasons are given by the Raikas for this; first, Dhebo-ji was from the Nayak caste, and second, because of his food habits -the term my respondents used for him was bhakshi, meaning he ate anything and everything that caused peril, like the entire army of the enemy and the witches. Placed in proximity to Pabu-ji's icon is that of Rupnath-ji. Worship in these temples, modelled after the standard technique of waving lamps before the deity and then distributing sugar-wafers and coconut flakes as prasada, is offered with drum-beats every evening by a Raika elder. In addition to the 'priest', for whom the term sevak is used, each of Pabu-ji's temples also has a spirit-medium, also called bhopa. That Pabu-ji has moved towards the transcendental deities is clear from the fact that like other Sanskritic deities, he does not possess anyone. The spirit-mediums in his temple are of Rupnath-ji. Pabu-ji remains more or less a caste-bound deity. His cult, like that of Devnarayan-ji (of the Gujars) and Teja-ji (of the Jats), does not extend beyond the confines of a specific caste. No big temples and a separate class of priests have emerged in his honour, as is with Ramdeo-ji. This is perhaps because the latter has become the rallying 6I 2</page><page sequence="25">THE RATHORE RAJPUT HERO OF RAJASTHAN point of the unity of the untouchable castes and their political action, which is not the case with other caste-bound deities. This, however, does not undermine the transcendental status assigned to Pabu-ji by his worshippers, who see him not only a guardian of their camels, but also the entire human life. Although there is less probability of his achieving the status of a pan-Indian deity, it is possible that he may become the rallying point-like Ramdeo-ji-of a social move- ment led by the pastoralists for their social rights and political protec- tion, if it ever crystallizes.
