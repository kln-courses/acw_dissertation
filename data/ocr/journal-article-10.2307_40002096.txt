<plain_text><page sequence="1">Guide to the Year's Work in Victorian Poetry: 1986 General Materials Richard Tobias I have been writing this report, I am astonished to discover, for twenty-five years. During the first ten years, I tried to read all the periodical writing about all Victorian poetry. Periodical writing gets lost so easily, and I conceived myself as a director, stimulating further discussion, in an annual seminar. I would bring people together; I would note connections; I would send writers off to continue work. Although I might note a smudge on a collar, I would not make sharp evaluations. I didn't comment on articles in this journal since all possible readers have already read this journal. Then all smiles stopped together. The volume and the range of essays nearly killed me. Thus for the last fifteen years a gaggle of scholars has gone in search of Arnold, Tennyson, and Browning, while I have tried to keep abreast of the theoretical discussions which frame our varied responses. The task is nearly as heavy because now I read very complicated books that no one would have thought to write in 1961. When I read those old surveys now, I realize how all this reading has changed me. What if I could have divided myself into two people - one continuing the ordinary routine while the other gathered into my data bank the drama between practical criticism and theory? I ought to be able to put a finger down and say, "There, it started," but I can't. From the beginning N. Frye simmered and H. Bloom flowered. There seemed to be a hiatus in the late sixties, and then slowly, almost imperceptibly, scholars began to work more consciously with theoretical discussions, usually by discussing the philosophical movements of the time. Feminists and structuralists preferred the novel for their playgrounds. The most eager theoreticians leapt from Wordsworth/Coleridge (the slash signifies) to the twentieth century with an occasional glance at Lewis Carroll. Now Victorian poetry is fair game. Morse Peckham says the nineteenth century is still the unknown century, and not only is it still unknown, it will become more unknown to us. 193</page><page sequence="2">194 / VICTORIAN POETRY He means that we have not yet put all our models to work to explain the vast amount of surviving data. Or, we have not become a sufficiently large interpretive community to grasp it all. We know very little about J. F. Ferrier, for example. Since new attention to texts and times complicated old texts that had seeming clarity, "The Lady of Shalott" changed from a fantasy for children to a nightmare for adults. If we could achieve coherence by ignoring what we chose not to see, new frames would force us to re-enter a richer, more complex, more recalcitrant world. Thus we make reading more interesting. We still debate science and poetry, the body and the soul, the phenomenon and the noumenon; we refine and correct our definitions of the dramatic monologue, the meditation, and we speculate on the true place of nonsense verse. We wonder if it could all be nonsense - and that its grace. We have better texts of Arnold, Browning, Tennyson, Hardy, and Christina Rossetti, but the Clough text is still incomplete. We add new material from that unknown century that is becoming always more unknown at the same time that we pay more attention to it. We look at a kaleidoscope by means of a kaleidoscope. New and varied pictures bewilder us more. No book this year quite shakes up old coherence as J. Hillis Miller's The Linguistic Moment last year, but several writers aspire to make their own new coherence. I will discuss first a new collection of essays by Morse Peckham, a series of articles by Lawrence Starzyk, and books by W. David Shaw, John P. McGowan and Jerome McGann. W. David Shaw's The Lucid Veil: Poetic Truth in the Victorian Age is listed in the Victorian Annual Bibliography for 1986, but it carries a copyright date of 1987. The book reprints essays, but a comparison of the essay Shaw published in this journal in 1981 with the similar material in the book shows complete and radical revision in the book. Shaw is not quite as graceful or persuasive as J. Hillis Miller, but he is more deeply and permanently into nineteenth-century thought and aspiration. To quote Miller, being "wholly logical and transparent" yields only falsification. Shaw's task in rethinking M. H. Abrams' The Mirror and the Lamp is more complicated than Abrams' original task, and Shaw cannot simplify a complex subject. As Abrams had the lamp, Shaw has the frame of a mirror or a picture as his presiding metaphor. His chapters begin with overviews; he summarizes at cruxes; he repeats critical words and phrases. He is writing, however, about Raphael Baruh, F. H. Bradley, William Brockie, H. T. Buckle, Edward and John Caird, Hartley Coleridge, Victor Cousin, E. S. Dallas, Sydney Dobell, James Douglas, J. F. Ferrier, Ludwig Feuerbach, W. J. Fox, Charles Gore, Alexander Grant, T. H. Green, George and John Grote, H. Helmholtz, T. H. Huxley, Alexander Johnson, Sir Henry Jones, Benjamin Jowett, John Keble, W. P. Ker, G. H. Lewes, H. L. Mansel, David Masson, Max Miiller, Karl Pearson, Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison,</page><page sequence="3">RICHARD TOBIAS / 195 Albert Schwegler, Alexander Smith (of Banff), William Henry Smith, James Hutchinson Stirling, Connop Thirlwall, R. C. Trench, John Tyndall, William Wallace, W. G. Ward, and a healthy range of present-day theoreticians (but not Paul Recoeur). He quotes Hegel from the edition owned by Tennyson. He has God's plenty of Carlyle, Mill, Newman, Tennyson, Browning, and Arnold. Among other things, he shows how Thomas Carlyle is and is not a Victorian Derrida. The book asks to be read by every reader of this journal. He refers to 11. 141-144, of the second part of Maud, expecting us to remember "O that 'twere possible." Well, we should. He should also be read by sociologists, philosophers, theologians, and all cultural historians. He tries for a richer and firmer grasp of the transformation that the Victorians participated in and illustrate. I will buy my own copy because I want to keep referring to it. I quote a sentence, almost at random, on Carlyle's task: "Man must become the new god, the architect of his own humanity and values" (p. 1 19). It is only by an oxymoron like "lucid veil" or "open secret" that Victorians can speak. The periodical essays where Shaw first assayed his topic were dense and suggestive; they come together into this book clearer and more persuasively than in their earlier form. To read Arnold, Browning, Tennyson or Clough without paying attention to what Shaw has written would be foolish. He makes me see "Dover Beach" better than I had before. John P. McGowan, in Representation and Revelation: Victorian Realism from Carlyle to Yeats, begins his introduction, "The subject of this book is the way the Victorians tried to connect mind with world." He cites Shaw's periodical essays, but he is closer to Jacques Derrida and Michael Foucault than Shaw is. His guiding genius is Paul Ricoeur, and that choice makes a difference. He has chapters, in this order, on D. G. Rossetti, Carlyle, Ruskin, Dickens, George Eliot, Browning, and Yeats. His logic is to move from Rossetti's inability to wed nature and experience, to the high Victorian idea of community, and to the final vision of the lonely poet writing poems about poems. The book is aimed toward Yeats in the sense that Yeats ended the effort to identify "reality" and thus solved the opposition between McGowan's main terms by Yeats's grand contraries or antinomies. The Victorians thought that the "ways we think and talk about the world do make a difference," but the modern viewpoint is that the "mind's activities can make no impact on a brutal, indifferent, and unthinking reality." McGowan might have quoted William Morris' lines about being an "idle singer of an empty day," for they are apt. The twentieth century has as its only defense an idea of comedy, but we know that the comic ending is an illusion, a temporary expedient, and, we vainly hope, a triumph. John Locke looms large in McGowan's book, as he does in Shaw's. Both books chart the Victorian writers' efforts to get; over Locke into some new paradigm,</page><page sequence="4">196/ VICTORIAN POETRY temporary though it may be. At the end, McGowan uses Yeats to illustrate the difference between "modernism" and Victorians but also to indicate the continuities between the two. McGowan's range is both wider and narrower than Shaw's; he is more interested in the shift than in Shaw's particularities, but McGowan is more grand in his conclusions. Morse Peckham's Romanticism and Ideology (1985) continues his collections of essays on romanticism published in 1970 and 1976. Seven of the essays are new, along with a theoretical "Introduction" which sum- marizes his book Explanation and Power (1979). It is a dense introduction. He sees complications undreamed of by our forefathers, and he realizes he is no nearer to a final definition, but then, like Miller and Shaw, we can only know the mise en abime, the lucid veil. The quest will end, if it ends, with the sight of some squat tower. In the best sense of the term, Peckham provokes thought. I wish more people would attend to him and argue with him. Of Jerome J. McGann's The Beauty of Inflections: Literary Investiga- tions in Historical Method and Theory (1985), I have read the "Introduction," suitably polemical, and the essays on Tennyson, C. Rossetti, and I will certainly read essays on Keats, Byron, Crabbe, Coleridge, and textual criticism when I have more leisure. The Introduction is a manifesto for the criticism and education that McGann wants in answer to Nietzsche's judgment on historicism. McGann will use our unknown century "to gain a measure by which our own present interests and ideologies may be critically observed" (p. 12). Every judgment will be suspect; it will be a scaffolding for the nonce, as "a fixed but non-absolute standard of judgement which can be altered . . . according to changing circumstances and points of view. The past is the heuristic measure, re-erected in the present, for establishing the securities of a future" (p. 13). I hear Arnold. McGann puts Tennyson's Crimean War poem into the history of its time and the history of Tennyson criticism. He reads C. Rossetti as an Anglican Adventist. He is a properly testy critic who challenges every anomaly. In one sense Lawrence Starzyk's three essays (I've not seen one published in Victorian Studies Association of Western Canada) may be described as reworking the quarrel between the ancients and moderns, or as the opposition between Arnold and Mill, or, in Morse Peckham's terms, about the need to develop a sensibility that can remain inside social tension without any irritable reaching for cause and reason. Peckham fears that we require some biological advance to reach such an equilibrium and such an advance takes about a million years. Starzyk concludes in " 'The Worthies Began a Revolution': Browning, Mill, Arnold and the Poetics of Self- Acquaintance" (Arnoldian, 13, ii: 10-27) that Victorian unrest existed because "determinacy of finality was the measure of artistic greatness." If the Victorians (and we late-comers) could "grow comfortable with the full</page><page sequence="5">RICHARD TOBIAS / 197 aesthetic implication of becoming self-acquainters, to discover and accept the fact that here indeed, Apollo are 'haunts meet for thee'," then we might move into Peckham's new stage of human awareness. Starzyk is more optimistic than Peckham or W. David Shaw, but they would say that they are cosmic optimists. Starzyk's "The Non-Poetic Foundations of Victorian Aesthetics" {BJA 26: 218-227) describes the difficulty of creation after Ruskin's "Dethroning of Jupiter, the coronation of the whirlwind." In logical sequence, Starzyk's aesthetics essay belongs before the Arnoldian article. His "The Reflex of the Living Image in the Poet's Mind: Victorian Mirror Poetry" (JPRS 7, i: 34-43) quotes some of the same texts cited by Shaw and McGowan, but Starzyk adds evidence from painting and photography. Starzyk appears to be, like W. David Shaw in the past, assaying a new statement on aesthetic and philosophic issues to continue the investigations of Starzyk's earlier book The Imprisoned Splendor (1977). Starzyk's task may be more difficult after Shaw, McGowan, and J. Hillis Miller. All of these efforts to wrestle the meaning and significance of this cultural transformation seem, in some sense, to be expanding and correcting Arnold's insights. Much of what these writers reconstruct painfully would have been on Arnold's nerve endings. Arnold, however, was too close to work out the permutations and implications. Arnold also did not use that difficult, complicated, and disturbing word "ideology" that may be a good substitute for "culture." Arnold's words about joining the Liberal Party sound in my ear, but I am also aware of Arnold's complacent tone in what we would now call his ideology. Returning to the alphabet, Michael Bright's "Metaphors of Reviv- alism" (VP 24: 245-260) belongs with Starzyk since he too talks about the battle between the ancients and the moderns. Bright adds architectural evidence. He concludes more pessimistically, for he sees that twentieth- century art is "more elitist, more completely estranged from popular taste." Bright can not quite believe that biology will eventually help us. Marilyn Butler's "Against Tradition: The Case for a Particularized Historical Method" (in Historical Studies and Literary Criticism, ed. Jerome J. McGann) has no direct impact on Victorian poetry, but she too sets out a manifesto in five critical principles: (1) read as far as possible within the original code or cultural system, (2) expand the canon, (3) sense the complicated relation to predecessors, (4) recognize our limitations, and (5) eschew dogmatism. She concludes "vatic criticism is a contradiction in terms," which is a way to talk about Arnold's disinterestedness without the political implications that Arnold's word implies. Terry Caesar's " 'I Quite Forget What-Say a Daffodilly': Victorian Parody' ' (ELH 5 1 [ 1 984] : 795-8 1 8) starts with an examination of six volumes</page><page sequence="6">198 / VICTORIAN POETRY of parody edited by Walter Hamilton between 1884 and 1889. As always, the good parodist is a good critic. Caesar employs his parodies to get at the meat of Victorian poetry. In the same journal, Robert Crawford's "Pater's Renaissance, Andrew Lang, and Anthropological Romanticism" {ELH 53: 849-879) explains how literary and scientific anthropological writing conjoined for one brief moment. Swinburne is also involved. The essay might offer Starzyk, above, further grist for his mill, and it is precisely the kind of investigation that Jerome McGann demands. I opened The Faber Book of Political Verse, edited by Tom Paulin, with great interest. Paulin has written fine verse about the present position of Northern Ireland, but his polemical introduction surprises (I think of Macaulay on Milton in 1825). He starts off by writing, "We have been taught, many of us, to believe that art and politics are separated by the thickest and most enduring of partitions." That teaching was a deliberate ideological strategy which Paulin will correct. He defines a political poem as a poem about political events, but his definition is precisely within that old critical doctrine that he wants to destroy. It is as if he has accepted his enemy's limitation and fights the enemy's battle. His Victorian examples are John Clare, Ebenezer Elliott, R. Browning ("The Italian in England," "The Lost Leader," "How It Strikes a Contemporary," and "My Last Duchess"), Clough, Tennyson (sections from Maud), Hopkins ("Tom's Garland") and Kipling. Where is William Morris? I can't imagine an academic use of the book, but it may have some effect in contributing toward what might be called, as shorthand, a richer non-conformist tradition. He makes the odd judgment that Matthew Arnold is "anti-intellectual because he is against those who seek to increase knowledge." I prefer Paulin's fine book of poems The Liberty Tree as a better encounter with the necessary marriage of mind and politics. Avrom Fleishman's "Notes for a History of Victorian Poetic Genres" {Genre 18 [1985]: 363-374) is precisely what it says: twenty-one numbered sections, all but one a paragraph in length, which list ideas and topics that he feels essential for future discussion. He first demands more use of neo- Marxist and Foucaultian organizing patterns. I would add Paul Ricoeur. He asks why Victorian poetry refers so little to contemporary politics, but he immediately notes that they could talk about Italian politics. Clearly Fleishman had not read J. Hillis Miller's The Linguistic Moment, but Miller, Shaw, and McGowan are answering his suggestions. Fleishman should stimulate writers like Lawrence Starzyk who are still involved in large scale attempts to define and explain. Debra Fried's "Repetition, Refrain, and Epitaph" {ELH 53: 615-632) is only tangentially on the Victorians- her examples are from Poe, Whitman, and Kipling- but she is so stimulating in her suggestion that an</page><page sequence="7">RICHARD TOBIAS / 199 epitaph is the refrain of a long unwritten poem on the subject's life and in her notions of silence and repetition, that I think she should be brought to the attention of Victor ianists. William A. Madden's "Framing the Alices" (PMLA 101: 362-373) is appropriate to anyone interested in Carroll, but has wider implications in the use of the Wordsworthian/Tennysonian conventions. We've paid a great deal of attention to Carroll's parodies, but we haven't considered the opening and closing poems. The framing poems do not parody, but they consciously adopt and exploit a style. In reading Madden's essay, I discover the poems are in my memory as much as the parodies, but I accept his claim that they have been ignored in critical discussions. They are not anthol- ogized because they belong so completely to their context. He also notices that the poems are kind of epitaphs. Marjorie Stone's "Taste, Totems, and Taboos: The Female Breast in Victorian Poetry" (DR 64: 748-770) has words about our own tastes and taboos. I've defined a PRB poem by the inevitable presence of a female breast, and I have thought that the trope is more often present in late Victorian poetry. She doesn't have Tennyson's letter on the Oread's breast in Lucretius (the British publisher wanted to delete the line, but Tennyson sent the line to the United States because the Americans, then, were "not so squeamish" as the British). The subject is still open, and a new scholar will consider Victorian painting in addition to more poems. Hans Ulrich Seeber's "The English Pastoral in the Nineteenth Century" (REALB 4: 67-96) speculates that the form died because of "radical change in the social and ideological environment," and he is chiefly interested in John Clare, William Barnes, Tennyson, and Morris, but not in Arnold, Clough, or Browning. Seeber lists two books of his own in German on the topic; this essay might be an introduction to his own fuller studies. In the same periodical, Claus Uhlig's "Literature - Philosophy - Religion: On Conceptual Architecture in Some Victorian Writers" (REALB 3 [1985]: 163-184) suggests that Arnold is the forerunner of today's "deconstructive criticism." Like Michael Bright above, he uses an archictectural metaphor to reflect on Victorian alternating fascination with progress and decadence and the Victorian attempts to construct a model, or a building, for their future. Again, the essay is long and thorough, but the subject does not quite have the impact that it might have had twenty-five years ago. Thus I have made my annual foray into Section V of the annual Victorian Bibliography. If I had more time and more space I would discuss the issue of Victorian Poetry devoted to the Wordsworthian matrix throughout the century. Criticism is long. A friend, when I started, said I would just mess up my mind with a lot of junk. The friend is a pessimist. Looking back over my notes, I see that the mind has been helping me. It</page><page sequence="8">200 / VICTORIAN POETRY trashes material for me. I also discover words on those note pages that I had grown to think and call my own. They are now. Although he is not cited in any of these essays or books, I read these essays through last year's encounter with J. Hillis Miller's The Linguistic Moment. These essays all supplement that book. If I continue this madness, I will be looking forward to the ways Miller fructifies our thought even more. If Miller, Shaw, McGowan, McGann, and Peckham aren't enough to stimulate the tyros, then I recommend Avrom Fleishman's twenty specific topics. The unknown century will become more unknown because the century is more infinite than our finite minds, or our habits of reading, or our prejudices and bigotries. For a moment, I fear that our criticism tries to create the same mise en abime that the poetry does. I end, by recalling McGann's words, "The past is the heuristic measure, re-erected in the present, for establishing the securities of a future." Those words sound downright Victorian. Matthew Arnold William B. Thesing In a recent workshop on publishing strategies and opportunities James Raymond, editor of College English, made the point that it is useful to think of each issue of a journal as a collection of conversations - a series of intellectual discussions that advance the development of knowledge with partial observations that offer perceptive and interesting insights. In many ways, this metaphor is helpful in approaching the body of Arnoldian scholarship assembled for 1986. Although there have been many an- nouncements of forthcoming book-length studies, collections of essays and letters, and international conferences on Matthew Arnold, this year's scholarship collection represents an epoch of concentration before the epoch of expansion that is promised as we move toward the centenary of Arnold's death in 1988. One of the most illuminating of the essay conversations this year is Rachel M. Brownstein's " Representing the Self: Arnold and Bronte on Rachel" (BIS 13 [1985]: 1-24). In clear, jargon-free prose, Brownstein departs from the stale pattern of solving the mystery of Marguerite's identity and explores new territory by examining Arnold's developing responses to the French actress Elisa-Rechel Felix, specifically as he presents her in the rarely anthologized sonnet sequence, "Rachel I, II, III." Nina Auerbach, in</page><page sequence="9">WILLIAM B. THESING / 201 both of her recent studies, Woman and the Demon (1982) and Romantic Imprisonment (1985), has discussed the symbolic importance, the trans- formative power, of another actress figure from the Victorian period, Ellen Ternan. Brownstein shows how Rachel Felix, a peddler's daughter and Jewish street urchin, "recreated herself in the image of art; . . . she acquired a distinctive identity and signifying power." On the basis of a few chosen texts, Rachel "created a heroic persona"; she represented "high Classical art and fatal Romantic woman" (pp. 1-2). Brownstein carefully delineates the "double perspective" of the literary images of Charlotte Bronte and Matthew Arnold. After subtle analysis of a range of considerations - creativity, urban confusion, self-consciousness, mimic art, and heroic persona - Brownstein's solution to the mystery is delivered with emphatic conviction: "Arnold affirms very strenuously his admiration of the tragic heroine, but makes her, finally, the symbol of everything and nothing, of everything because nothing - therefore of death. For Arnold Rachel was more of a threat, for Bronte more of a promise, than either one acknowl- edged" (p. 21). Truly, this exciting essay should be of interest not only to feminist critics but to all Victorian scholars. The women in Arnold's long poem Tristram and Iseult have received their share of scholarly attention in recent years. David V. Harrington in "Buried Passion in Matthew Arnold's Tristram and Iseult" {Arnoldian 13, i: 23-30) is well aware of the most recent critical interpretations of the depiction of women in the poem, and he offers a more positive reading of the resolution of the poem than that found in several recent articles. He contends that "the younger Iseult by telling the tale of Merlin's enchant- ment sympathizes with Vivian, and, in effect, gives dramatic reinforcement with her tale to the moral apostrophe by the narrator." Thus, with Harrington's interpretation, the poem ends on a positive note, "with Iseult finding for herself what promises to be a more satisfying life than that experienced by either of the famous lovers." Although Harrington con- vincingly demonstrates the positive values of the story-telling, he makes no use of current new critical theories on narratology. (For example, William A. Ulmer in "Romantic Modernity in Arnold's Tristram and Iseult" (TSLL 27 [1985]: 62-85) reaches similar conclusions and offers more sophisticated analysis.) This year another group of critics offers extended conversations on Arnold and poetic theory, rhetorical strategies, and the proper subjects for poetry in the mid- Victorian age. In " 'The Worthies Begin A Revolution': Browning, Mill, Arnold and The Poetics of Self- Acquaintance" {Arnoldian 13, ii: 10-27), Lawrence J. Starzyk offers his most perceptive comments on the poetic theory and practice of Tennyson in "The Lady of Shalott" and of Browning in "Cleon" and "Childe Roland." Concerning Arnold, however,</page><page sequence="10">202 / VICTORIAN POETRY he does point out that he "more poignantly than any other poet in the period suffered the frustration of the man compelled to delve within his own breast in search of his self." Thus, in many of Arnold's poems - "Obermann," "Resignation," "Parting" - the "universe in the fragmented vision dis- closed by the mirroring poet mocks the self-conscious visionary seeking to regard life steadily and whole." Although the essay is a useful exercise in critical synthesis, Starzyk tends to overstate the "enormous significance" of key principles of Victorian poetic theory. Varying degrees of failure are also assigned to Arthur Hugh Clough and Matthew Arnold as William Sharpe judges their struggle to write poetry about the nineteenth-century city in "Confronting the Unpoetical City: Arnold, Clough, and Baudelaire" (Arnoldian 13, i: 10-22). Sharpe calls Clough's Dipsychus "remarkable for its refusal to consider escape to the country as a means of addressing urban malaise, and for its dogged resistance to the city's sexual allure Clough's anguished self-examination provides a unique record of how the Victorian poet tried - and failed - to find a genuine place for the city in his art." Sharpe's analysis of Arnold's writing reveals even more stubborn barriers to appreciating urban subject matter: "an aesthetic abhorrence of modern life, a Wordsworthian idealization of nature, and the influence of Biblical archetypes of the fallen city." To my mind, Sharpe oversimplifies Arnold's "misanthropic" views of urban crowds. His lavish praise of Baudelaire's poetic treatment of Paris in some respects begs the question because he alludes to but does not delineate "common features in the social and economic make-up of London and Paris during the nineteenth century." Although Sharpe offers a useful bibliog- raphy of recent criticism on literature about the city, one study that he does not mention offers a more subtle and complete analysis of Baudelaire's aesthetic experiences within the urban setting - Colin Mercer's "Baudelaire and the City: 1848 and the Inscription of Hegemony" m Literature, Politics and Theory, edited by Francis Barker, et al., pp. 17-34. Mercer's theoretical remarks concerning the relationship between flaneur and crowd are particularly illuminating. Readers of this journal will already be aware of several significant conversations on Arnold and poetic theory/rhetoric that took place here within the past year. By carefully setting up a trio of categories, David H. Covington in "Aristotelian Rhetorical Appeals in the Poetry of Matthew Arnold" (VP 24: 149-161) examines the contrasting image of the poet projected in several poems. "To a Republican Friend, 1848" and "The Buried Life" make ethical appeals; "Growing Old" makes an emotional appeal to fear; and "The Sick King in Bokhara" makes an emotional appeal to pity. In my opinion, Covington's article is often too general, abstract, impersonal, and didactic. Stressing the classical influences on Arnold's poetry too exclusively reinforces the notion that the purpose of poetry is to</page><page sequence="11">WILLIAM B. THESING / 203 teach. Covington's analysis of "To a Republican Friend, 1848" goes far in explaining Arnold's use of Aristotle's techniques for persuading "the audience," though he loses sight of Clough's identity and the political currents of that revolutionary year. With a series of emotional and ethical appeals, Arnold's single poetic goal becomes an attempt "to educate his audience." By the end of his essay, Covington's own didactic tone becomes very heavy: "No one escapes suffering in this world, just as no one can escape guilt. Our only hope for overcoming our human frailty is to assert our human compassion. We must have pity for one another; we must be gentle" (p. 160). Questions concerning Arnold and audience are also addressed by Michael Bright in "Metaphors of Revivalism" (VP 24: 245-260). Bright offers a detailed examination of Victorian reviewers' harsh judgments of poets who used classical and medieval subjects in their works. For example, Arnold's Merope was judged to be an imitation of "a form which has ceased long since to have any active life." Bright's essay should be read in conjunction with Sharpe's because Bright also attempts to define the ways in which Arnold viewed the Victorian period as "unpoetical." Bright is working with contemporary material that is not widely available, and he offers fresh insights concerning Victorian aesthetic goals and dilemmas. In Thais E. Morgan's special issue of Victorian Poetry, devoted to the topic "Wordsworth among the Victorian Poets," Arnold's views are touched upon in several of the essays. Thai's E. Morgan's own essay, "Rereading Nature: Wordsworth between Swinburne and Arnold" {VP 24: 427-439) is the most rewarding in offering sustained insights concerning not only Arnold's relationship to Wordsworth, but also Swinburne's reaction to both poets' views of nature. Morgan's analysis of Arnold's long and challenging "Resignation" is first-rate scholarship and she proves her point that the poem can be read as a parody of several Wordsworth poems. Morgan is well-informed in matters of current critical theory, yet she is patient and considerate enough to define such terms as "intertextuality" for readers who have not yet crossed over into the promised land of modern criticism. The focus of a readable essay by Richard Lessa is the nature of the poet and his function. In "Arnold's 'Thyrsis': The Pastoral Elegy and the True Poet" (DUJ 48: 37-44), Lessa makes some interesting comparisons with such other nineteenth-century versions of the pastoral as Wordsworth's Michael and Clare's The Shepherd's Calendar. Although he applies too easily the labels of "false aims" and "false action" upon city life, his formula of "true" harmonious balance has some validity. "The work of the poet . . . calls for both contemplation and action, for it seeks to realize and to reveal the essential nature of one's self and of humankind in general." The fulfillment of poetic promise, according to Lessa, requires a certain degree of detachment from the eddy and flow of the world.</page><page sequence="12">204 / VICTORIAN POETRY Arnold and America is the topic of conversation in two brief articles in The Arnoldian. Laurence W. Mazzeno reminds us of Arnold's continuing relevance to the mainstream of modern business practices in "Arnold in Contemporary America: or, Juggling with 'Numbers' " (Arnoldian, 13, i: 31-32). Mazzeno wryly speculates on the importance of "humanity" in business dealings; he is intrigued by the fact that the first chapter of Thomas J. Peters' and Robert J. Waterman's In Search of Excellence (1982) is entitled "The Saving Remnant." Jane W. Stedman in "Some Unpublished Letters of Matthew Arnold to Richard D'Oyly Carte" (Arnoldian, 13, ii: 1-9) quotes from six previously unpublished letters - only one of which is recorded in Arthur Kyle Davis' checklist. She throws some new light on Arnold's business negotiations with his agent for the 1883-84 trip to America and on his meticulous preparations for making the ocean voyage. These missives are a delight to read. Furthermore, we can all applaud the official announcement this year that Cecil Y. Lang has decided to go ahead with a complete edition of Matthew Arnold's letters, to be published by Harvard University Press. Arnold's writings continue to be a popular subject of discussion in graduate student circles; four doctoral dissertations are noteworthy this year. Saundra Segan Wheeler's impressive study "Matthew Arnold and the Young Writer" (DAI 46: 3729A) addresses Arnold's poetics from the poetry of 1849 to the poetry and prose of 1867. Wheeler argues that the young writer is addressed "both directly and obliquely as a metaphor for imaginative life." Her study adds to our increasing understanding of the importance of Arnold's use of the poet-persona. Also, the creation of a persona "who embodies the values called for in his criticism" is central to John L. Kijinski's reading of Arnold in "Values, Assumptions, and Persuasion in the Literary Criticism of Arnold, Pater, and Wilde" (DAI 46: 3360 A). Kijinski's comparisons of the three writers' rhetorical strategies for persuading readers of the power and values of literature yield new insights concerning the diminishing prospects of culture as the Victorian period comes to an end. Following in the footsteps of Ruth apRoberts and James C. Livingston, Terry G. Harris explores the topic of Arnold's religious opinions in "Reconstructing Christianity: Matthew Arnold's Religious Essays, Christian Romanticism, and the Church of England" (DAI 46: 3358A). Harris examines Arnold's religious essays published during the 1870s and concludes that "although he was influenced by the Romantic tradition that preceded him, he actually rejected it." The various chapters compare and contrast Arnold's ideas with those of Coleridge and Newman. Terrence Richard Whaley scrutinizes the old contenders of science and literature in "Matthew Arnold and Thomas Huxley: The Value of Science and Literature for a Liberal Education" (DAI 46: 2185A). Whaley's formulas appear to be too simplistic: "For a period often years . . . Arnold</page><page sequence="13">WILLIAM B. THESING / 205 extoll[ed] the value of literature, and Huxley that of science." However, Whaley does offer fresh insights concerning the idea of progress and the aesthetics of scientific discovery as revealed in the various Victorian debates. The recent appearance of a collection of essays and three anthologies would seem to herald a significant annual development in Arnoldian scholarship. Unfortunately, these publications are of uneven quality and one is even a dubious, misguided undertaking. On a positive note, I recommend enthusiastically The Oxford Authors volume on Matthew Arnold, edited by Miriam Allott and Robert H. Super. The anthology offers 275 pages of selections from Arnold's poetry and 225 pages of prose selections. In addition, there are over 100 pages of interesting, helpful, and detailed notes to these works. In her introduction to the poetry, Allott explains that the poems are arranged in chronological order of composition; she also offers reasons for Arnold's poetic decline. Although Super - in his introduction to the prose- admits that Arnold "was brought up in an atmosphere of serious concern for religious questions, for education, for the impact of history on modern life," he also maintains that an important aspect of his character has been neglected: "his playfulness." Also, Super sheds new light on the issue of miracles and explains why he included the infrequently anthologized essay "A Psychological Parallel" (pp. xx-xxi). With its carefully chosen selections, introductions, notes, and editorial matter, this book is an indispensable scholarly contribution and a welcome tool for classroom use. Two other anthologies are less significant contributions. From The Penguin Poetry Library comes a reprint of Kenneth Allott's 1954 selection of Matthew Arnold's Poems (1 985) . A brief, but enlightening new introduc- tion has been written by Jenni Calder. In addition, Arnold is represented in a curious, but handsomely produced volume in this same series - The Penguin Book of Bird Poetry, edited with an introduction by Peggy Munsterberg (1984). One of the memorable generalizations from the long (75 pages!) introduction is that "In Victorian poetry, there is a steady erosion of bird traditions. The more bizarre disappeared almost at once." To be sure, Arnold fits this pattern: in his poem "Philomela" he omits the horrors of the murder "because his theme is not the crime, it is the emotions which surround it - love and hate; triumph and agony; passion and pain." The most disappointing book that I read this year is the collection of essays, Matthew Arnold: Between Two Worlds, edited by Robert Giddings. The "two worlds" that Arnold moves between are the past and the future. This canyon- wide breadth of interest allows the contributors to range over such topics as Arnold and education, religion, criticism, culture, and Ireland. New insights or innovative critical revaluations are few and far between. As the first title in what will be a series of publications of essay compilations to mark the centennial of Arnold's death, this collection does</page><page sequence="14">206 / VICTORIAN POETRY not offer a very auspicious beginning. Giddings' own introduction to the volume opens the verbal acrobatics as Arnold's wisdom, irony, and spirit are repeatedly invoked against "the monster of unbridled Philistinism" that stalks the terrain of nineteenth- and twentieth-century education. Giddings provides polemical warnings against the "propounders of this rag-bag of falsity and confusion" and that cluster of "fulminations." And what is the reader to do with such an extreme assertion as the following: "Would it be such an exaggeration to say that as far as giving the middle class its Culture was concerned, Matthew Arnold was a fascist with his heart in the right place?" (p. 21). Giddings applies various labels in order to explain Arnold's feelings of doubt and alienation as well as his "gloomy social vision" of the urban-industrial age. The tone in several of the essays is pompous, even condescending. Only two essays touch on Arnold's poetry: John Woolford's "The Sick King in Bokhara: Arnold and the Sublime of Suffering" and William Kaufman's "'A Religion of Sorrow': Arnold's Relation to Comedy." There are several errors that have eluded the editor's eye: for instance, Lesley Johnson, not Lesley James, published The Cultural Critics in 1979 and there are two different dates given for Arnold's death. We look forward to improved collections of essays that will serve as fitting commemorative issues for the centennial of Arnold's death. So far, three publications have been announced: the Winter 1987-88 number of The Arnoldian will be a special issue with articles by David Riede, Sidney Coulling, Howard Fulweiler, Michael Bright, and others; Clinton Machann and Forrest Burt's collection, Matthew Arnold in His Time and Oursy is forthcoming from the University Press of Virginia; and Jerold Savory and John P. Farrell report an overwhelming interest in their planned special issue on Arnold for Victorian Poetry. On the conference circuit, Liverpool University has announced plans to sponsor an international conference to mark the centenary of Arnold's death. It will be held July 20-22, 1988. Distinguished speakers will present papers and there will also be excursions to Arnold locales. In the meantime, I make an urgent appeal to all producers of Arnoldian scholarship to send me offprints, copies, and announcements of their work for consideration in future annual reviews!</page><page sequence="15">DOROTHY MERMIN / 207 Elizabeth Barrett Browning Dorothy Mermin I am happy to recognize the centenary of Victoria's jubilee (and the twenty- fifth anniversary of Victorian Poetry) by reporting the appearance of the first full-length (or almost full-length - it's actually quite short) feminist study of EBB's poetry. Angela Leighton's Elizabeth Barrett Browning is organized around the major figures in the poet's life, with chapters for her father, her mother, Bro, and Browning, and the works associated with them. For Leighton, by far the most important of these is her father, who was both object of desire and the force that prohibited desire, and as a combination of muse and precursor (in accordance with Joanne Feit Diehl's formulation of the Bloomian dynamics of influence for female poets) both inspired and blocked her poetry. Leighton argues forcefully against feminist critics who accept the male view of woman as Other: for EBB, she says, the Other was her father. The mother's role she sees as less important and largely negative, associating it with cold and hostile figures in the ballads and with the female spirits of enchantment who are sought but not found in "The Deserted Garden" and "The Lost Bower." The chapter on Bro yields some fine analysis of the sonnets on grief, and Browning is seen as the muse of Sonnets from the Portuguese. The two chapters on Aurora Leigh trace the final unsuccessful quest for the dead father and its displacement by the quest, which does succeed, for a sister. The sister - for whom, interestingly enough, Leighton adduces no biographical counterpart - is the last in the series of muse-figures, the one that inspires the "new, vitally contemporary woman's poetry" (p. 154) that both Aurora and EBB learn to write. This book is clearly organized, persuasively argued, and full of excellent readings of poems and suggestions about the relation of the poet's life to particular works. It is part of a series that does not allow for inclusiveness, and one wishes it were longer; it uses no unpublished materials, it ends with Aurora Leigh, and despite its high valuation of contemporaneity and commitment to the cause of women it says nothing about any of the political poems except "The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim's Point." But it is the first good book on EBB's poetry since Alethea Hayter's. My own essay, "Elizabeth Barrett Browning Through 1844: Becoming a Woman Poet" (SEL 26: 713-736), covers some of the same ground that Leighton does, focusing on the family constellation and treating many of the same poems; my discussion of EBB's mother would have been somewhat different if the first volumes of the Correspondence had been available when I wrote it, and I imagine that Leighton's would have been different too. In</page><page sequence="16">208 / VICTORIAN POETRY "Genre and Gender in Aurora Leigh" (VN 69:7-11), I attribute both the scandal and the success of Aurora Leigh to its violation of generic and gender boundaries, and in "The Damsel, the Knight, and the Victorian Woman Poet" (CritI 13: 64-80), I consider the difficulty that EBB, Christina Rossetti, and Emily Bronte found in situating a female speaker within poetic conventions. The main concern of this year's criticism, in fact, is with issues of gender and genre. In a tightly argued, wide-ranging comparison of Aurora Leigh and Helen in Egypt, "Gender and Genre Anxiety: Elizabeth Barrett Browning and H. D. as Epic Poets" (TSWL 5: 203-228), Susan Stanford Friedman makes some important generalizations about the feminization of epic, a traditionally masculine and publicly-oriented literary form. Both poets, Friedman points out, feminize epic by the infusion of lyric and novelistic elements; they redefine heroism in female and personal terms, moving women to the center of epic action and placing them in a context of relationships with other women, especially mothers, while they make their male heroes (Romney, Achilles) undergo a transformation that culminates in the abandonment of male privilege; in general, they explore their conflict as poets with patriarchal culture and attempt "a deconstruction of the binary gender system underlying poetic genres" (p. 222). Kathleen Blake's "Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Wordsworth: The Romantic Poet as a Woman" (VP 24: 387-398) outlines similarities in plot and theme between Aurora Leigh and The Prelude, finding the main difference in the fact that for Wordsworth art and love nourish and support each other, while for women they seem mutually exclusive: thus the end of Aurora Leigh, the promise of a marriage that will unite art and love, is the equivalent of Wordsworth's starting point. New volumes of The Brownings* Correspondence, edited by Philip Kelley and Ronald Hudson, continue to appear with pleasing regularity. Volume IV (1838-1840) begins with the Barrett family about to move into their new house on Wimpole Street and ends in Torquay with EBB's refusal of Mary Russell Mitford's offer to send her a cocker spaniel named Flush. In the interim The Seraphim and Other Poems was published, EBB became ill, and her brothers Sam and Bro died. During these years she wrote very little poetry, partly because her doctors thought serious reading and writing were bad for her and partly because she was often too weak to write. From October 1837 she rarely went out of doors, and for weeks at a time she did not leave her room; it seemed likely that she would not recover, and at their most optimistic the doctors could offer only the prospect of a very moderate return to health. Still, much of her correspondence is taken up with literary matters, especially the gratifying reviews of The Seraphim and her contribu- tions to the annuals edited by Mary Russell Mitford. Letters of particular interest in this volume include the beginning of her correspondence with R. H. Home (the earliest ones, however, are missing).</page><page sequence="17">DOROTHY MERMIN / 209 Home, whose "genius" she much admired, was the first real poet with whom she had more than a brief and formal association, and while Home published most of her letters to him they have never been annotated or published accurately or in full. There are also new letters to John Kenyon that deal with literary matters, and some to old friends that usefully sum up her situation and the family news. Her letters to her brothers and her playful and affectionate ones to Arabel give a better sense than we've had before of her relations with them. Unfortunately, however, there seem to be many letters missing, or at any rate subjects not covered - nowhere is there a hint, for instance, of Bro's thwarted desire to marry. The Supporting Documents include a number of excerpts from letters written by other members of the family that refer to EBB, filled with affection and concern and unanimously describing her as patient and cheerful - as indeed, in her own letters, she tries very hard to be. But the darker side of the relations in this closely-knit family, much given to expressions of piety and affection, can sometimes be glimpsed too, especially in Henrietta's description of their father's reluctance to let EBB go to Torquay and in Edward Moulton-Barrett's sanctimonious, graceless prose. One cannot but feel sorry for the twice-bereaved father threatened with the loss of his eldest daughter, but the pleasure he takes in her weakness is, to say the least, unnerving: But what a Creature she is, I reverence her for the beauty of her character, so happy a specimen of Christian submission &amp; devotional feeling never was surpassed - No murmur is ever heard to escape her, no wish uttered to be better, only once or twice I have heard her say, as to any future plan, if it should please God that I should be better &amp;c - Humanly speaking I should say, her health &amp; strength are desirable for the Chest. . . . But let us never cease importuning the Most High to spare her to us. (p. 365) It is annoying, too, to find him holding her up to her brother Septimus as an example of unassisted intellectual accomplishment: "what were her advan- tages" (p. 361) - as if her lack of advantages were not his own fault. We are still in the curious phase of this project in which we have, in effect, two entirely separate correspondences, interleaved on a chronological basis and connected only by a prospective union between the two principals that seems on the evidence of these letters most unlikely to occur. Every now and then Browning bursts into this generally low-key and gloomy book like an incarnation of gusto and energy: "I have, you are to know," he says in the first of his letters, "such a love for flowers and leaves - some leaves - that I every now &amp; then, - in an impatience at being unable to possess myself of them thoroughly, to see them quite, satiate myself with their scent, - bite them to bits" (pp. 66-67). He travels abroad, visits literary people, and deals busily and hopefully (although not always successfully) with the business of a poet-dramatist's career. The only intimation of a connection between these two disparate lives is Browning's quotation of an unattributed phrase ("all</page><page sequence="18">210 / VICTORIAN POETRY goeth but God's will," p. 256) that, the editors point out, EBB had quoted as the motto for "An Island." The editors having adopted the practice of including contemporary reviews of the poets' works, this volume contains reviews of The Seraphim, many of them from obscure periodicals otherwise very difficult of access, and of EBB's contributions to annuals. Less lavishly illustrated than previous volumes, it includes the pictures (also very hard to obtain) that the poems for annuals were written to accompany. As these volumes show and as anyone who works on EBB quickly realizes, an enormous amount of important material has still not been published. Phillip D. Sharpe has performed the very useful service of making one of the most interesting manuscripts of poetry (and one of the hardest to read, at least on microfilm) available, with commentary, in his doctoral dissertation, "Poetry in Process: Elizabeth Barrett Browning and the Sonnets Notebook" (Louisiana State University, 1985). This notebook from the early 1840s was in private hands until 1979 and has not previously been used by scholars. It contains twenty- three poems and fragments, nearly half of them unpublished, including several translations of sonnets, a dramatic monologue of sorts condemning the callousness with which the rich ignore the sufferings of the poor, and "The Princess Marie," a very interesting long poem about Louis Philippe's daughter, a sculptor who died of consumption (but according to EBB, of her art) in 1839. I hope others will follow Sharpe's example. Robert Browning John Maynard As in so many years recently, 1986 saw steady and impressive work in developing the basic scholarly knowledge of Browning's texts and context that has been for so long badly required. To begin with texts: With the attention given to the new Yale-Penguin and Oxford editions of Browning has been a tendency to count out the once famous - or infamous - Ohio edition. It has its very serious problems; it stopped publishing for many years; but it is not dead. A decent fifth volume appeared in 1981 covering the last of the Bells and Pomegranates through the first half of M en and Women. It is finding capable direction and bibliographical competence in managing editor Allan Dooley. The old problems with the copy text and with</page><page sequence="19">JOHNMAYNARD / 211 inadequate knowledge of manuscript materials have been essentially licked (I won't rehearse my evaluation of these technical issues in the Ohio text which I presented in VP, 1982; the procedure and most of the Introduction remain the same). We now have from Ohio a rather exciting event: the publication of The Ring and the Book, books one through four, edited by Roma A. King, Jr. Collins-Pettigrew did not include The Ring and the Book, which had been previously issued in the same series in a text edited by Richard Altick of the 1868-69 edition. Oxford has a very long distance indeed to go before it arrives at the great epic of Browning's late middle age. Altick's edition quietly asked the dangerous question that everyone now seems to dare ask about texts: why prefer an author's last intention to his earlier one? The Ohio edition, which suffered badly in the reviews for its difficulties in identifying Browning's last intentions, oddly now does well when we begin to accept the idea that there are many legitimate texts, from different points in the author's life, that different readers, for varying reasons, will wish to consult. The old Ohio's notorious idea of the author as a continuously innovating medium seems where many of us have come to, after all the controversy over Wordsworth and Shakespeare. In its almost as notorious recording of all variants leading up to the copytext, Ohio gives each reader a kind of kit to create his or her preferred text. The Ohio edition offers a virtual rare bookroom full of texts for any Browning poem where the determined critic can trace the author's changing intentions and craft for any particular line - as well as the occasional interference of the printer. Unlike Altick, King offers us the text from Browning's old age, the 1889 second impression of the 1888-89 text. For this text, unlike many of the earlier poems, there are, in fact, few changes from the first edition to the copytext. Because Ohio is now careful not to authorize and endorse changes made by printers' errors, one could argue that this is a very reasonable choice for a reader's text. Browning touched up word choice or phrasing here and there rather than rewrite the text, as he did some others, especially Pauline, by favoring his mature judgment over that of his earlier self. (Like Morse Peckham, who did a separate edition of Sordello to show how often one could argue changes in successive texts were the printers' rather than Browning's, I incline to suspect that there could have been more justified editorial emendations than the two and a quarter pages chosen here.) What is interesting is the text of the manuscript of The Ring and the Book that can be reconstructed from the variants. We can see quickly how Browning's conception developed into the classic phrasing of the text we know. Without a trip to the British Library and days of hard labor we may easily appreciate the pains Browning took, as he put his text in shape through manuscript, galleys (apparently not extant for books one through four), and revisions (in Beinecke: Ohio provides readings of page proofs and corrections on the</page><page sequence="20">212 / VICTORIAN POETRY proofs, as well). The poem that proclaims our human speech naught was created with great care; having the full record of this care in the text offers some great advantages to compensate for the cumbersomeness of the Ohio presentation. A spot check of some four hundred lines (no errors at all) shows that the editors are transcribing the text carefully, as they did in the fifth Ohio volume, though not always in the earlier volumes. King offers a useful and concise chronology of events in the story (oddly a chronology of history and fiction, The Ring and the Book and Old Yellow Book at once), a description and account of the sources, and a history of the composition of the work. The latter seem even too brief, omitting a great deal of Browning's comments on the work in progress, its relation to Elizabeth, and his odd offers to other writers of his quarry. The notes themselves are an important update and addition to detailed scholarship on the poem. Any annotator of The Ring and the Book has the advantage of standing on the shoulders of giant (if sometimes nodding giant) antiquarians, Treves and Cook. King was also fortunate in being able to draw upon the good work of Altick's edition of the poem. King is now the last word: his annotation is generally as full as Cook's and as authoritative as Altick's. He gives essay-like commentary on perennial thorny subjects - Molinism, St. George, the ring and the ring metaphor, Pompilia's literacy. He wins kudos for identifying the philo- sophic sin and has other small but important triumphs such as the meaning of "Quiet as Carmel" as a reference to the nunnery. More generally valuable is the wealth of Biblical reference he rightly concentrates on identifying. Years ago Minnie Machen's little book on The Bible in Browning pointed out how rich the verbal echoes are. King adds tens of such identifications. He explicated the many literary allusions consciously used by Browning's speakers. We have only to remark how free Browning is of verbal echoes (as opposed to direct allusions) to any text except the Bible, in tremendous contrast, say, to Tennyson: not a proof of Browning's limited education only in the Bible - the poem is packed with a very wide literary culture in its direct allusions - but indication of Browning's refusal to work in other poets' syntax and lexicon. A special problem in The Ring and the Book is the "real" history: should the annotator, as Cook often does, make it his business to write a running history of the historical events as he, as opposed to Browning, now sees them based on presumed superior powers as a scholar and the fuller historical record we now possess? The temptation is irresistible; the rewards, satisfying the reader's curiosity naturally roused by the historico-epical poem, making one's own Bloomian strong reading of the poet's text, are considerable. I like Altick's quick treatment of such issues. I have, grudgingly, to admit that King's added commentary on the history is hard to resist: one has a curiosity about the texts beyond the text. Too often</page><page sequence="21">JOHNMAYNARD / 213 the spirit, as with Cook, is simplistic: the real truth versus the poet's lies. Historians now tell us history is itself a matter of fictions and fictions. One fears for the beginning student who is led down the path that proclaims the poet's truth naught and every scholar's words the simple facts. Annotation in this volume continues, in one respect, the Ohio tradition: they do not curb their eloquence. Notes begin well with much new research; they end in pedantry. Like Pettigrew in the same series, Altick has the virtue of pithiness: a great virtue for an annotator. Compare his on alembic, "distilling apparatus" to King's "A simple apparatus for making distilla- tions" or on Domuspro carcere, "house arrest" to King's "Literally, a house for a prison: a condition corresponding to our 'house arrest.' " If there are no longer notes on Venice as a major Northern Italian city there is still the old (and so natural to teachers of the poem) Ohio desire to tell all, with excessive notes on subjects such as the geography of the sea of Galilee, the Pope's Jubilee, Cicero as a Roman statesman and orator, and comfits. A general editor, insisting on condensation in each note, would have done wonders and kept the reader's attention on the poem itself. With these weaknesses, this is nonetheless a major piece of work, excellent in its sensitivity to literary effects in the poem and unflinching from hard points. Combining such an excellent text and useful apparatus with such a high level of annotation, the Ohio The Ring and the Book promises to be perhaps the most valuable contribution the edition has made so far: an acceptable scholarly text of Browning's great single poem. That other seemingly endless publishing project, The Brownings' Correspondence, came out with the fourth of the forty or so projected volumes. The size of the venture will show its worth when it comes to the years in which Robert and Elizabeth's lives ran together: the synoptic letters will give us a great deal of day to day detail on both poets, with the special illumination that comes from so many crosslights. In the meantime, the plan rather swamps poor Robert in the far more abundant letters of his talented future correspondent and spouse. In the earlier volumes this effect was perhaps easier to overlook. Robert's rare early letters also began later than Elizabeth's so one was content to murmur: his time will come. But here we are up to the quite public Robert of 1838-40, the time of Macready and Sordello, the young man making his way as an established force in the new Victorian generation. And still we wade through pages of entirely uncon- nected material to find the few Robert letters (or if we are reading Elizabeth's far more vivid chronicle of this traumatic period in her life we are rather rudely interrupted by somewhat too formal and artful letters by an unknown man accepting or regretting invitations to dine). Perhaps it would have been better to throw consistency somewhat to the winds for the period before the convergence of the twain and give us one slim volume of all</page><page sequence="22">214 / VICTORIAN POETRY Robert's early letters. Certainly both the scholar and the general reader would prefer it so. Of the 181 letters in this volume 28 are by Robert, and they are an even smaller proportion by bulk. Another five are to Robert. Except in the love letters, whose importance as a kind of high poetics as well as high drama Daniel Karlin's book recently and rightly emphasized, Robert was generally neither a revealing nor an artistic letter writer (whereas throughout her life Elizabeth is one of the more interesting correspondents of the century). The letters in this volume are not an exception. Only three, to Fanny Haworth, have some of the personal projection and literary flamboyance of the love letters, muted in proportion as this seems to have been a controlled flirtation in comparison to that full-hearted love affair. A few other letters, notably one to Domett and one to Macready, are also full and interesting reading. The majority are simply brief notes of two or three sentences, aimed as the great majority of Browning's letters are at accomplishing a piece of business cordially and efficiently. This is not to say that the Robert Browning letters here are unimpor- tant. We have so little in the way of primary evidence of his early years that even brief notes are of special value, often throwing the only light we have on months of his life. Of the twenty-eight letters by Robert, sixteen are here newly published (three of those to Browning are also additions to the record). This considerable supplement to prior volumes of Robert's letters certainly continues to show the fruits of Philip Kelley's years of preliminary research. He has found good letters in such less-than-well known literary collections as the Dunedin Public Library, Dunedin, New Zealand or the Southwark Central Reference Library in the poet's old stomping grounds. Among the new letters is quite an important one in the series to Haworth, which includes interesting references to Procter and to L. E. L. as well as the curious information that a horse named Paracelsus was running at St. Leger. There is also a brief but warm letter, in French, to the French friend Ripert-Monclar - from the series of interesting letters that had long been known by, but were not available to, Browning scholars. Other, less intrinsically interesting letters provide a good deal of useful information about Browning's serious efforts to advance his career during this transi- tional period. A number show him nervously sending copies oiSordello or receiving the warm but not generally positive responses of literary friends- Landor (Browning values his critical judgment very highly; he returns that he looks forward to reading the poem but that Browning overrates his acumen), Procter (he is about to read it), Milnes (Browning hopes the poem pleases), Ripert-Monclar (Browning recalls how they used to talk about Sordello), Harriet Martineau (she hopes the poem will prove a crown to him). Of course it was to prove more a crown of thorns than of laurel, at least</page><page sequence="23">JOHN MAYNARD / 215 in the short run, and other letters show us the young poet moving quickly to cover for his tactical error by pushing plays on Macready and offering more popular works and plans for popular publication to publishers such as William Smith. Other brief letters show us Browning writing to the scholar John Payne Collier for information about the ballad The Atheist's Tragedy or planning to take Landor and Tennyson (the books) with him to Italy. Apropos of that 1838 (Sordello) trip to Italy, the editors generously include a full transcription of Browning's brief diary entries on the voyage, from the Toronto MS. Here we can pinpoint the very day Browning was off St. Vincent, how he came into Venice to his appointment with roughhewn humanity, and exactly the days and places of his almost pilgrimlike experiences in the heights of Asolo. The volume is as handsome and generously executed as the preceding three: beautiful print, paper, and cover, lovely frontispiece and illustrations, full supplementary materials, including a record of other documents relevant to this period: a fine product made in America by Philip Kelley's intelligent, lean, and efficient Wedgestone Press with proper support from NEH. Annotation, by Ronald Hudson, is generally up to the high standards established in earlier volumes. DeVane and Knickerbocker's New Letters are corrected for dating of one important letter (that to Macready, now of August 9, 1840) and Hudson often gets hard references others missed (e.g., young Edward Denison, Bishop of Salisbury at age 36). Here and there one looks for a bit more: for instance, what was that Atheist's Revenge ballad? Could a clearer discussion be offered of the Shelley volumes (as indeed it is in New Letters) that Browning sent to Moxon? In reading the accessory materials one is oppressed by thirty-seven pages of Barrett materials, much about issues that Jeannette Marks already has explored in more detail than most anyone could wish, and only four entries for Robert. Surely there is more, including those in Macready's diaries, cited even in the notes themselves- or do I misunderstand the system in this appendix? Many of the annotations, including identification of that horse named Paracelsus from the Times, are exceptional bits of scholarship; the full printings of published reviews for the period is a great service in itself, often the result of more than ordinary searching and scholarship. Despite reservations about the premature marrying of Barrett and Browning in the endpapers and motto on the cover) I continue to believe this is an extraordinarily important and generally excellent edition, a major addition to our knowledge of both poets. Some interesting specialized studies also valuably illuminated special corners of Browning's life and associations. Patrick Waddington's inter- esting little book, Browning and Russia (Baylor Browning Interests) bears a date of late 1985 but didn't appear on my desk until later. It deserves its</page><page sequence="24">216 / VICTORIAN POETRY modest place on the full Browning shelf next to Korg's study of Browning and Italy or Gridley's The Brownings and France. Browning had only two important connections with Russia, in contrast to the immersion in Italian and French literature and life: the interesting trip at the beginning of his career in 1834 and the fine late poem "Ivan Ivanovitch" on a Russian subject. Waddington has made no newsworthy discoveries about either of these connections but, with his excellent knowledge of Russian literature, language, and history he has provided a remarkably detailed record of what can be known. Through the accumulated detail of his researches into Browning's early visit and his careful review of the possible sources for the poem (none of them in fact directly Russian) he leaves us far better able to form a critical assessment of Browning's interest in this, then, rather marginal and ill understood culture. Research into state papers has, alas, not revealed specific references to the young English poet traveling with the Russian diplomat Benkhausen (Waddington prefers the Slavic Benk- gauzen), but it does clarify the origins of the trip in a crisis over Rothschild refinancing of the Russian national debt and the duration of Browning's stay in St. Petersburg (one month). Better, he gives us a realistic circumstantial picture of the world of Russia and St. Petersburg that Browning would have experienced, including the carnival fair on the Neva that he considered using as a setting for a drama. The wealth of details about various Western versions of the sleigh and wolves story of Browning's poem makes an interesting history in itself, especially because the origin of the tale remains unclear. Waddington also offers a comparative account of Robert and Elizabeth's political attitudes toward Russia (not much in Elizabeth's favor) and a summary of Browning's relations to Turgenev (neither very cordial nor admiring). In another fine piece of scholarship, really of modern antiquarianism, John Coulter (BSN 15: 2-19) presents new evidence about the Browning residence at New Cross based on an entire archive of the Haberdashers Company, which owned the land on which the Browning family residence after 1841 stood (and who finally succeeded in pulling it down and erecting row housing in 1890, thus obliterating all memorial of the residence). Coulter's new evidence and excellent careful work allows him to establish the exact site of the Browning house, telegraph cottage, somewhat to the west of my own speculation, and also to obliterate the one possible visual impression that has survived. Coulter's prints of the nearby area do confirm the impression we have from the letters that the Browning family lived at New Cross in a very comfortable area of country homes, still outside of London's encroaching and enormous development. The two servants in the Browning household indicated by Coulter's new records, while fewer than the three or five servants of some of their grander neighbors, certainly</page><page sequence="25">JOHN MAYNARD / 217 confirm the sense of substantial comfort we have of the family. This is an excellent work in those incredibly dusty local records, where a good deal more research could be done on the social context of Victorian literature. A final, very competent, and useful work of biographical scholarship is Meredith B. Raymond's substantial article on John Kenyon (SBHC 14: 32-62). Raymond offers a full account of the Brownings' friend and generous patron, based on careful work in a great variety of published sources as well as some unpublished work (some presented at the end of the article). There may be minor additions and adjustments when the full record comes out of the Browning correspondence but this will stand as a very thorough, well balanced, and thoughtful summary of the life and work of this interesting person. Kenyon, as Elizabeth wrote Robert, was something of a "Sybarite of letters" rather than a full man of letters. He avoided mental labor and strife of heart and lacked the "faculty of worship" (which she believed Robert had in good measure). If he indeed was no Robert (or Elizabeth) he was a man of importance in his day whose philanthropy is especially memorable. He gave the Brownings substantial support during his life and a fortune at his death, settling once and for all the question of what porridge Robert Browning would have. One of the effects of that fortune was to allow Robert to move into his patron's shoes, as a prominent participant in literary society as well as literary production. Kenyon's poems, on toleration, on the limits of his own abilities, and on many an occasional subject, were no wise up to Robert's, as Kenyon knew. As a literary man of the world Robert never could come near Kenyon's high and genial style. "Kenyon the Magnificent," as Robert called him, seemed to know every writer of importance in the two generations of English literature up to his death in 1856. His magnificence in generous support for literature and charity (he left money to ninety persons at his death) and if the famous hospitality of his literary breakfasts (where the fare was far above porridge) was accompanied by less of the older Robert's boisterousness and self- proclaimings, less of Elizabeth's posing and moral domination. He was a Pickwick or a Jarndyce, but also something of a Skimpole, who preserved a childlike love of life's joys. If Dickens couldn't imagine the combination, real life could, and also gave him a sense of refinement in appreciation of the arts and delicacy about others' needs. Biography delights in such unbeliev- able and attractive hybrids, where no novelist could dare offer such a patent fiction. Raymond tells a pleasant and interesting tale comprehensively and very well. In contrast to these important advances in editions and scholarship there was considerably less important critical work, a good deal less than the prior year. Perhaps energies went into the unusual Browning conference at</page><page sequence="26">218 / VICTORIAN POETRY Southwestern College, close by Philip Kelley's trim and attractive world headquarters for the Browning correspondence at Winfield, Kansas: an interesting gathering of scholars and a fine exhibition of Browning manuscripts; or perhaps critical studies are being delayed in publication for the centennial year in 1989. Mary Ellis Gibson's History and the Prism of Art: Browning's Poetic Experiments, announced for 1986, in fact appeared too late in 1987 for review here. How much there is still to explore on the subject of Browning and history is clear from Lee C. R. Baker's "The Diamond Necklace and the Golden Ring: Historical Imagination in Carlyle and Browning" (VP 24: 31-46). Using Hayden White's theoretical approach to all history as necessarily involved in fiction-making, Baker distinguishes between Carlyle as historian as romantic ironist and Browning as historian as unself-conscious mythmaker. The final turn of the essay, in which Baker evaluates Browning's insistence on myth-making as his particular strength, doesn't seem persuasively argued. Yet Baker's critique of Peckham's position that Browning can be seen as an historical relativist aware of the limits of all positions including his own is a useful one, well presented. George Myerson has a cogent and well presented essay on Paracelsus in Browning Society Notes (15: 120-147), a journal that deserves better circulation in the United States (it is not like the original Browning Society publications: indeed it is rather intelligent and even intellectually bold, as is that other misnamed, or too modestly named journal, Browning Institute Studies). Myerson explores Browning's sources for the poem in Crollius and Paracelsus' Philosophy Reformed and Improved (1657, in English) and Agrippa's Of the Vanity . . . ofArtes and Sciences. He uses this source work to establish a newer and more interesting point: that Browning has a thesis about Paracelsus as a scientist, as well as a romantic quester. Using Kuhn's paradigm for the emergence of modern science in the breakdown of the closed Neoplatonic or Hermetic system of magus and magic and its replacement by an infinite and objective system of scientific exploration, he shows Browning criticizing Paracelsus' initial role as subjective possessor of truth (Book I) but explaining his final vision as the successful discovery of the universe as open, objective, and infinite (Book V). Finally, he places Browning's view of science as exploring God's infinite universe in opposition to totally secular paradigms for the universe. This is an important interpretation that raises our judgment of Browning's historical ability in the areas of intellectual history and history of science. Samuel L. ChelPs The Dynamic Self: Browning's Poetry of Duration (1984) shares Myerson's view that Browning discovers in Paracelsus contrasting ideas of time that are essential to his work. Unlike Myerson, he is not interested in the scientific implications of the new time of infinite extension but in time itself as at once subject and structure of all Browning's</page><page sequence="27">JOHNMAYNARD / 219 poems. Chell adapts Bergson's concept of time as duration within experi- ence rather than, on the one hand, eternity removed from life or, on the other, mere material motion in a straight line (as in clock time). Chell then essentially makes a reading of Browning's poems from Pauline to The Ring and the Book with the theme of time as his central truth. We read Browning's message about time as ultimately a psychological and spiritual one: the dynamic self, to remain dynamic, must remain in time. Time as change may be creator or unmaker, but it will prove a truly destructive element only to the character (or reader) who attempts to evade the process. Dynamic selves accept experience by intuitively building on past and present in inner consciousness. If Sordello generally refuses process and tries to thrust in time the concerns of eternity, the lovers of "By the Fireside" richly mature, not by freezing the good moment as an epiphany out of time but by building their self-consciousness on a sense of past and present. The Browning philosophy of time, which is surely convenable to many concerns in Browning's poems, ends even with the old central truth - incarnation as the symbol of the reconciliation of eternal and ordinary time. There is something too static in this approach, which too often accepts the model of old time in which a philosophy of life (even an attractive, pulsating one) is read into and out of Browning's works. And Chell indeed can see his activity not only in relation to Tucker's work on Browning's evasions of closure or Hassett and Slinn's concerns with definition of character in Browning, but also in harmony with the traditional cause of answering Jones and Santayana's claims of barbarism in Browning. A more complex system for talking about time would have helped (Bergson is no longer the only starting place: I do count one mention of Poulet, although there may be others I couldn't find in this indexless book). A structure that explored Browning's varieties of views of time rather than began, disser- tation-wise, with a formula - even the elegant and brief formulation of Bergson that Chell provides - would have thrust the criticism more into the moment and away from the general exposition of a position. The point is not that Browning had a good or bad theory of time (isn't even Santayana's poise and civilized permanence attractive to all readers of Browning sometimes?). The point is that Browning is much preoccupied with time in his work. Indeed strong readings could see individual poems- "Pictor Ignotus," "Abt Vogler," "Andrea del Sarto," or "Cleon" -revealing a deeper drive toward release from the wheel of time or the Heraclitean/Browningesque flux in which they are found. Chell's own reading, of Pauline, Paracelsus, and Sordello, of monologues on love, art, and religion, of The Ring and the Book, are generally not as challenging on the subject of process as Tucker's or so probing about the substantiality of character as Slinn's. They are nonetheless well worth</page><page sequence="28">220 / VICTORIAN POETRY consideration. At their best they stress not only the thematics of time but also time as structural element in the poems. He makes many interesting points about the time tenses of poems as modes of presenting issues of time(to be compared with Loy D. Martin's more technical observations on "The Being Written" in his Browning's Dramatic Monologues and the Post- Romantic Subject [1985]). Chell also makes interesting speculations on time in the consciousness of the reader, especially in The Ring and the Book - though these are not fully worked out into a system of reader response (or reader manipulation). Chell is certainly correct in calling our attention to the centrality of time in Browning's poems: his implicit definition of a Browning monologue as a compression into a few lines of the consciousness in time of a lifetime is an excellent starting point for his explorations of the tremen- dously different time systems of different poems. Another work, also actually published in the fat year before this lean one, Harold Bloom's Robert Browning (Modern Critical Views) is a collection of articles and selections from earlier years. It does feature as Introduction an interesting article in which Bloom revisits his own career- long preoccupation with Browning's revisionary company, especially Childe Roland. Bloom is among the extremely few major, general critics who have insisted upon wrestling with Browning's obviously central, exceptionally eccentric, place within the canon of English poetry. No critic is more exciting to read on Browning: without a major work on Browning himself (as, say Shaw, Tucker, Ryals, or even Miller - a long section in The Disappearance of God) he has, by his controversial strong readings of Browning as antithetical quester, probably come closer to dominating critical discussion on Browning than anyone else since Langbaum. His revisiting here addresses metacritically his own obsession with the anti- thetical quester in "Childe Roland" and, as with most obsessions, succeeds especially in repeating the obsession: how can we relate Browning's quest (to put it briefly and badly) to that of Shelley? Moving through a dazzling group of interpretations of Browning's poems on music, of "Andrea del Sarto," of "Childe Roland" (once more briefly but impressively) and of the stunning lyrics of A solando, all of which he reads by the light of both Nietzsche's deconstructive formulas and Freud's familial interactions, he arrives finally and unexpectedly at the neglected poem "Thamuris Marching." Here is the quester once again, doomed to defeat but happy in the sublime moments of earthly joy, a fellow traveler as poet of earth to Shelley as poet of divination. Perhaps the problem of reconciling Browning to the Shelleyan model of the poet is there laid to rest. But evidently such good readings, which keep insisting on "strong" readings of poems against their apparent grain, also read Browning generally against the grain. Bloom focuses obsessively on the few poems in which he can read the character as a version of Browning</page><page sequence="29">JOHNMAYNARD / 221 himself, as one reads poems of most of the Romantics. Even Andrea del Sarto, whom he grants is not like Browning, is still presented as a projection of the poet's situation. To find him citing Betty Miller repeatedly, without much criticism of her simplistic equations between Browning as man and Browning's characters is not surprising. More essentially, the poems are read as Romantic poems, as quests for the self-definition inhabiting poems. That an objective poetry of earth might demand an entirely different poetics, closer to systems of irony and rhetorical structures more amenable even to Booth, Iser, or Riffaterre than to Bloom, doesn't seem to occur to him - or when it does such canonical approaches to "poetry always dramatic in principle, and so many utterances of so many imaginary persons, not mine" are swept away with majestic contempt. We are fortunate to have in Bloom such an inspired misreader of Browning, whose strong cuts a rebours force us to set aside our whittling commentaries on individual monologues and face the major issues in defining a poetics for Browning. The collection is as interesting addition to Bloom and Munich's useful earlier critical essays. It somewhat oddly mixes classic statements in the relatively recent history of Browning criticism (since Langbaum, say, and beginning with him, in fact) with less well known but attractive essays, not necessarily in the mainstream of critical concerns, such as John Hollander's lovely "Browning: the Music of Music." Tucker's central work appears briefly near the end of the collection. In between is a long reprint of Bloom's own familiar reading of "Childe Roland" from A Map of Misreading. That Bloom leaves out entirely major modern criticism of Browning (Hillis Miller, Shaw, Ryals, even Slinn's provocative work) while publishing so many essays essentially sympathetic to his approach is bothersome; Armstrong sees "Mr. Sludge, The Medium'," in her intricate interpreta- tion, as a kind of failed quester; Tucker is the most Bloomian of the new theoretical critics; Ann Wordsworth's fine Lacan-inspired essay on the gaze in Browning is also Bloom-inspired and is in fact reprinted from Bloom and Munich's earlier collection; Steven Shaviro's reading of "Caliban" is another Freudian study of a quester. Bloom has a right to choose criticism he finds convenable and offer a very personal recent critical history. The rest of us would be better served by either another broad collection of the major approaches to Browning from Langbaum to the present, or, what is probably of more use now, a collection of the newer theoretical approaches (Shaviro, Tucker, and Wordsworth stand for them here) that have been revising our way of looking at Browning in the 1980s as much as Bloom himself did in the 1970s. Vincent P. Anderson's Robert Browning as a Religious Poet: An Annotated Bibliography of Criticism (1983) is a useful work of critical bibliography, also really a contribution to the history of Browning criticism.</page><page sequence="30">222 / VICTORIAN POETRY Many readers may not find the subject promising since it must surely take us back not so much to Browning's exciting poems on religious subjects but to those studies of Browning as a religious leader, as an answer to the problems of faith for our time, as a poet of the incarnation, and all the rest, that began with the original Browning Society and continued with Berdoe, Charlton, and their successors - and seems to go on and on, if one looks at Books in Print, as the reprint houses keep churning out these antiques of Browning scholarship to their helpless customers, the unsuspecting or very thorough university librarians. I should say immediately that Anderson lacks the ironic perspective and close wit that made William Peterson's study of the Browning Society such fun to read. (Anderson does call Hickey's "Glorious Robert Browning" an "unfortunate title.") But his thorough and modest commentary provides a very useful anatomy of these and the many other kinds of attitudinizing on Browning and religion that have characterized the unfolding reception of this controversial part of his canon. We have had heretical Brownings, skeptical Brownings, Brownings very sure of God and pessimist Brownings, existential Brownings, Brownings preoccupied with a central truth and Brownings swimming in phenomena, Brownings for whom God is love and Brownings for whom He refuses to come. I suggest that anyone interested in adding to this (on the whole) not too impressive literature first study Anderson's general summaries and useful annotations. Excerpts from some contemporary reviews at one end and summaries of dissertations at the other, both not definitive, are also useful; and Anderson helpfully notes the relevance of general critical and biographical works to his central issue. Ashby Bland Crowder, in a long article, "Browning and Women" (SBHC 14: 91-134), enters a passionate area in a quiet and orderly way. After a review of Browning's relations with women, he summarizes Browning's attitudes toward various topics relating to women. He leaves the poems to the side and treats the letters as so much expository material. This approach raises some questions: letters are not essays but reactions to dynamic and changing real situations. Still Crowder is aware of this problem and does tease out of this somewhat alien material a fairly coherent profile of Browning's warm, generally positive, sometimes confused attitudes to women. He liked women physically, liked to touch and hold them - the collected evidence seems to raise that old question of whether Browning had some kind of secret life before Elizabeth or after her death - but he also could criticize women for showing physical affection in public, and then again get rather too physical himself for some of his dinner companions' tastes. He believed generally in women's ability to achieve aims as high as men's but pooh poohed their being allowed in to the hurly-burly of Parliament. He believed strongly in rescuing poor women bullied by</page><page sequence="31">JOHN MAYNARD / 223 patriarchal dragons - so they could begin a new life as strong mentors and leaders of their rescuers, who would sit at their feet. What does man want? Crowder's odd methodology, leaving out all those poems on these subjects, at least allows a dispassionate comparison of what we think we see in the splendid poems to what we are sometimes only amused (or sorry) to find in the prosaic letters. George Ridenour also treads on ground that feminist critics dispute when he attempts to show the parallels to Aurora Leigh in The Ring and the Book. Robert creates Pompilia in the image of Marian Erie, herself indebted to the real Elizabeth, despite the difference in class. Verbal echoes, even the phrase "the central truth," point back to Elizabeth. Robert's epic follows his wife's in its realistic material and melodramatic treatment. Yet, here's the rub: Robert's melodrama is better, "more consequentially melodramatic," than his predecessor's (predeceasor's). Shouldn't the next point be a version of Nina Auerbach or Adrienne Munich's views of the two poets' relations: Robert misprisions Elizabeth with his distorting and defeating work; his ring, as Munich has said, surrounds and cancels hers: poetic posy proves stronger poetry. At least such a point of view would strengthen Ridenour's significant comparison. Finally, two articles tried out new approaches to Browning's work that should prove productive for other critical efforts. In his "The Arrangement of Browning's Dramatic Lyrics (1842)" (in Poems in Their Place: The Intertextuality and Order of Poetic Collections, ed. Neil Fraistat), George Bornstein reminds us how carefully Browning paired dramatic lyrics in the original volume and shows the important lights attention to the poet's ordering can throw on the themes and art of the poems. Like Yeats, Browning crafted his individual volume to create a larger poetic design that gave special kinds of significance to individual works. Bornstein's inter- esting summaries of themes in these generally matched and interlocking poems shows how productive this approach can be. Because Browning later reorganized these poems in collected editions - a fact that Ohio and Yale- Penguin have preferred to ignore in their orderings - his original orderings take us back to some troubling questions about choice of text. We have some argument for reprintings of the original edition as well as the artificial text we have - later texts in original publication order - in the standard editions. Sarah Gilead's " 'Read the text right': Textual Strategies in Bishop Blougram's Apology" (VP 24: 47-67) takes us, once more, into the breaches (or gaps) of this labored, and frequently labored over, monologue to try out some new critical models. Drawing on Huizinga and Caillois' ideas of play, and on Herbert Tucker's concept of the ducal reader who attempts closure, she sees the three personas, Blougram, Gigadibs, and the narrator as all playing a game of trying to frame and bring to closure the others: a lively critically current article that is also somewhat too rushed, unfocused, and</page><page sequence="32">224 / VICTORIAN POETRY tends finally to create its own distorting frame of triple game for what is mostly the verbal pyrotechnics of only one player. Good as some of these studies are, important as the Browning texts being published are, the year's work leaves me forced to conclude that this was not a boom one for Browning - a dip in the overall index after last year's high volume of activity. It has given me a chance to do belated justice here to some works from that year. I won't believe, after such very lively debates between the older New Criticism and the newer theoretical work in the early 1980s, that we are moving into a critical age of tired or sullen silence. Thomas Hardy William W. Morgan Worth noting - as one index among many of the ways in which the map of critical esteem has been redrawn in relatively recent times - is that Hardy first took over his own space in this annual report in 1974, having been listed (along with Hopkins, Yeats, and several others whom we now think of as major poets) in the 1963 inaugural report among those in "the second range of interest," and then with the "other poets," taken up in alphabetical order, between 1964 and the appearance of the reorganized "Annual Guide" a decade later. That he was categorized thus was not, of course, a failure of taste on the part of Richard Tobias (who, even when he had to cover the entire field in the early days of this report was unfailingly thorough, thoughtful, witty, and discriminating, and who has always been supportive of Hardy's verse): Hardy simply was a minor poet for Victorian scholars in the 1960s and early 1970s- indeed, anybody who was not Arnold, Tennyson, or Browning was a minor poet. Some of the writers who were promoted from the alphabetical list and allowed a room of their own in 1974 were probably the beneficiaries of a general redistribution of territory, the result of a conscious challenge to the supremacy of the "Big Three" that was taking place at the time; but in the case of Hardy the redistribution coincided with a significant surge in his stock as a poet, a surge that still shows no signs of slowing down. Not only has there been "real growth" in the amount and quality of work being published on Hardy, but there has also been a redistribution of emphasis within that work: according to my rough calculations, the ratio of critical and scholarly works on Hardy's fiction to</page><page sequence="33">WILLIAM W. MORGAN / 225 those on his poetry has, during the same period, moved from about 25:1 in the early 1960s to something more like 4:1 now. When I proposed a dissertation on Hardy's poetry in 1967, I felt like something of a rash innovator (there were, at the time, only two books on the poems, and the only edition was the old Collected Poems). Those of us who are writing about Hardy's poetry now are doing so under the influence of a very different set of assumptions and in a very different atmosphere from that which prevailed when VP began to review the "Year's Work" in 1963. This year's group of books and essays is heartening in that it suggests that a good deal of ferment and change is still going on, but it is disappointing if one is looking (as I confess I am) for a large and convincing thesis that will "name" and account for Hardy's achievement in verse. Some of the material needed for presenting that thesis has been made available to us in Lennart A. Bjork's new edition of The Literary Notebooks of Thomas Hardy, 2 vols (1985), an impressive piece of editing and commentary and a very welcome contribution to our understanding of Hardy's writerly self- discipline and of his response to the intellectual issues of his day, and in volume 6 of The Collected Letters of Thomas Hardy, ed. Richard Little Purdy and Michael Millgate (1987), the latest in the superbly edited series of volumes that have been appearing at regular intervals since 1978. Both of these books will prove to be mines of information for future critics and scholars, whether they are working on single texts, single issues, or trying to formulate a comprehensive thesis about Hardy the poet. Manas Mukul Das' Thomas Hardy: Poet of Tragic Vision ( 1 983) - a book that I have missed until this year - is an interesting and useful attempt to present such a thesis by relating Hardy's poetry not to traditions of modern and post-modern alienation and fragmentation but instead to an older tradition of tragic understanding - a vision of life that is grounded in a sense of community and of shared (as opposed to individual) suffering. Although I have my reservations about Das' book (it is over-argued and somewhat repetitive), I welcome his central conception. He has provided us with a timely reminder that Hardy's poetry affirms an idea of common humanity, and he has quietly and modestly made the claim that Hardy's tragic compassion and fellow- feeling are as important as his rough eccentricity in any argument for his status as major poet. The editorial work of Bjork was published in 1985 and that of Purdy and Millgate in 1987. Textual scholarship in 1986 shows only Simon Gatrell's edition of The Return of the Native: A Facsimile of the Manuscript, with Related Materials and a crop of unusually thoughtful reviews on the 1985 outpouring of major editorial work - all of which has been generally praised and welcomed. This is only a lull, however, and not the end of the movement to give Hardy's work every benefit of the best modern textual</page><page sequence="34">226 / VICTORIAN POETRY scholarship and his life the fullest possible documentation: yet to come are full-blown scholarly editions of more Hardy fiction (including the short stories) and of the verse-dramas, The Dynasts, and The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall. There will also be one more volume of The Collected Letters, &amp; selection of the best from among the many "Interviews and Recollections" of Hardy (to be chosen and edited by James Gibson), and, presumably, editions of the remaining notebooks (now in private hands and unavailable for publication) - two of which, entitled "Studies, Specimens, &amp;c." and "Poetical Matter," promise to be of special interest to scholars working on the poetry. In the meantime, Hardy critics do not seem inclined to wait: some very interesting interpretive work is appearing, both on the fiction and on the poetry. The new book-length studies that treat Hardy's novels and short stories are all, in their different ways, historically based; in the process of analyzing and interpreting Hardy's work, that is, they all connect it to issues in literary and intellectual history - to the Impressionist movement and other devel- opments in art history (J. B. Bullen, The Expressive Eye: Fiction and Perception in the Work of Thomas Hardy), to the history of the novel as a genre (Peter J. Casagrande, Hardy's Influence on the Modern Novel), to Victorian and modern views of women, marriage, and sexual relations (Pamela L. Jekel, Thomas Hardy's Heroines: A Chorus of Priorities), and to the history of the short story in Victorian England (Harold Orel, "Thomas Hardy: An Older Tradition of Narrative," in his The Victorian Short Story: Development and Triumph of a Literary Genre). New essays on the fiction are a bit more mixed in character, but my three favorites are similarly historical: Patricia Alden's "Canon Formation and Value: The Case of Hardy" (CEA 48 [1985]: 75-84), Norman Arkans' "Hardy's Novel Impression-Pictures," (CLQ 22: 153-164), and Robert Squillace's "Hardy's Mummers" (NCL 41: 172-189). Some of the critics on the fiction read Hardy's relation to history "outside-in," and others read it "inside-out," but whether one sees history as shaping Hardy or Hardy as shaping history, there seems to be a distinct and, in my view, very welcome movement to assert and explain a connection between the two. I have spent this much space on matters not relating directly to the year's work on Hardy's poetry because it seems to me that what is best about this year's rather small group of essays on the verse (there were no books in 1986) is that they are all grounded in a similar kind of historical and documentary consciousness and that, this year at least, that kind of consciousness has appeared at full length only in editorial work and in longer studies of the fiction. Apparently, however, critics of the poetry are well aware of this consciousness and are putting it to good use. I cite in particular the reprinting of Samuel Hynes's fine 1980 essay, "The Hardy Tradition in</page><page sequence="35">WILLIAM W. MORGAN / 227 Modern English Poetry" (The Thomas Hardy Journal 2, iii: 32-49), Charles Lock's " The Darkling Thrush' and the Habit of Singing" (EIC 36: 120-141), and Dennis Taylor's "Hardy and Wordsworth" (FP24: 441-454). What these three essays (and, on a much smaller scale, my own "Verses Fitted for a Monument: Hardy's Contribution to the Dudley War Memorial," The Thomas Hardy Journal I, i [1985]: 25-32) have in common is first, that they take patient account of such extratextual matters as variant readings, serially published versions of the poems, unpublished notebook entries, letters, and the like, and, second, that they take responsibility for the image of Hardy the poet that is implied by their insights about the texts. What we have been wanting for a long time, I think, is some sense of the texture of Hardy in the act of being a poet: we want answers to questions like "How much did he know (about himself, about poetry, about his subjects and themes, about his relation to tradition, etc.)?" "To what extent is he controlling the extraordinary range of effects in his verse?" and "What is his concept of audience?" Essays like these three, which connect their close readings of texts to the historical life out of which those texts arose, and which present an idea of the poet that is congruent with the details of that historical life as they are coming to be known, are, in my view, indications of real progress in the study of Hardy's poetry. Good omens exist for the future as well: I note that several Hardy dissertations have been completed this year; I heard several very good conference papers at the Hardy Society Conference last August; I see that two new materialist studies of Hardy have been announced for next year; and, last but not least, I learned in England this spring that there are thousands of young A-level students working away at Hardy's poetry in preparation for national exams next June (James Gibson's Chosen Poems of Thomas Hardy is a "set text" for the exams). So, confident that 1987 will bring me something to write about, and that, in England at least, Hardy is being taught and studied in the schools and universities, I end this year's report as I began last year's: please send me notice of anything you have written, published, read, or heard about Hardy the poet- copies of books, essays, and conference papers, and notice of important reviews and other matters I might have missed. The more I know the better job I can do.</page><page sequence="36">228 / VICTORIAN POETRY Gerard Manley Hopkins Jerome Bump Last year Walter Ong's book on Hopkins appeared, along with a new edition of his poems, and essays that focus on Hopkins and femininity, psycho- analysis, decadence, modes of religious response, epistemology, Welsh, Latin, Vaughan, Lawrence, Hughes, Fenellosa, and individual poems. Ong accomplishes his primary aim brilliantly in Hopkins, the Self, and God: to demonstrate the contemporary relevance of Hopkins, Ignatius, the Society of Jesus, and Christianity generally. I have discussed this aspect of the book in detail in C&amp;L. From the perspective of Victorian poetry, however, I am astonished by the apparent ease with which Ong dismisses the persistence of "the old rhetorical tradition" in Hopkins (p. 141), Hopkins' sympathies with Victorian medievalism (pp. 8, 134, 159), and Hopkins' difficulties with Darwin (pp. 133, 158). I am surprised because both Ong and McLuhan began as students of Hopkins' historical context and went on to champion many aspects of "the old rhetorical tradition." Ong began his career with an M.A. thesis (1941) and later an essay (1949) on the "Historical Backgrounds" (primarily Old English) of sprung rhythm. McLuhan began with an essay on "Analogical Mirrors" in Hopkins (1944), and in a 1954 review identified Hopkins as "an authentic voice of the Pre-Raphaelites ... as a poet their solitary artistic triumph." In this book, however, Ong relates Hopkins and Ignatius to Roland Barthes (p. 54) and deconstruction (p. 130); he even goes so far as to call "The Wreck of the Deutschland" "Ur-Hemingway" (p. 50). On the other hand, Ong does reject J. Hillis Miller's thesis in The Disappearance of God that for Hopkins each person is "diabolically idiosyncratic," and argues instead that for Hopkins the self "is holy in its very idiosyncratic isolation," citing Augustine's belief that God is "interior to my innermost being" (p. 143). As the reference to Augustine suggests, Ong does not ignore Hopkins' medieval heritage as completely as he dismisses his sympathies with Victorian medievalism. He acknowledges the origins of Hopkins' art and thought in the Bible (p. 135), the Fathers (pp. 20, 97), the Roman Breviary (p. 136), medieval literature (p. 137), Scholasticism (pp. 89, 96), and of course Duns Scotus. He also concedes that Hopkins' training continued many agonistic, residually oral traditions, though he questions the authenticity of Hopkins' attempt to reestablish the importance of oral performance of poetry (p. 141). In addition, he associates Hopkins with the Victorian focus on particularity in nature and the emphasis on the self in Victorian poetry. In the final analysis, however, this book will do</page><page sequence="37">JEROME BUMP / 229 much more to situate Hopkins in a modernist rather than a Victorian context. Catherine Phillips' edition in the Oxford Authors series, Gerard Manley Hopkins, also was published last year. It includes a selection of the prose and, unlike previous editions of the poems, presents the poems in chronological order. This new arrangement is a great improvement for it demonstrates "how much continuity there is in the moods and characteristic traits of Hopkins's verse"; in "The Alchemist," for instance, "there is the incipient despair at lack of productivity found in ... 'To R.B.' " and "My prayers must meet a brazen heaven" anticipates "Carrion Comfort" (p. xvii). Her introduction assimilates much of current scholarship, including that of Norman MacKenzie cited later in this review, but perpetuates the myth that Hopkins gave up trying to publish his poems after The Month rejected them (p. xxi). In fact as late as 1881 Hopkins enlisted the help of Dixon and Bridges to help him get some of his sonnets published in one of Hall Caine's anthologies, only to be rejected ultimately by D. G. Rossetti. One of the most revolutionary articles on Hopkins last year was Jeffrey Loomis' "Birth Pangs in Darkness: Hopkins's Archetypal Christian Biog- raphy" (TSLL 28.1: 81-106). Loomis cites Gilbert and Gubar, who began their seminal feminist text, The Madwoman in the Attic, with an attack on Hopkins as a "representative" Victorian male artist. Loomis demonstrates, however, that in his poetry Hopkins confronted his "petulant 'masculine' self," his jaded " ' Jackself ," and "reached far past the boundaries of his own dominantly sexist 'Victorian culture' " (pp. 87, 92, 83). Loomis suggests that for Hopkins "all artistic and spiritual persons must allow their receptive, 'feminine' animas" (p. 82) to be impregnated by a force greater than themselves. He traces impregnation, uterine gestation, birthing, and related imagery throughout Hopkins' poetry, but especially in the terrible sonnets, and shows how these metaphors were supported for Hopkins by Victorian Marianism, Newman's "Second Spring" sermon, Faber's The Foot of the Cross, and Keble's "Christmas Day," as well as "the androgynous spiritual 'feminine'" focus (p. 100) of medieval writers such as Meister Eckhart and Origen. A more negative sense of androgyny and the "feminine" in Hopkins is explored in Donna Moder's psychoanalytic "Aspects of Androgyny, Oedipal Struggle, and Religious Defence in the Poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins" (L&amp;P 32.1: 2-18). Like Loomis, Moder begins by citing the Gilbert and Gubar passage, conceding that it embodies "the narcissistic wish for mastery and its attendant assertion of masculinity," but adds that there is also in Hopkins a "co-existent wish to be mastered, a masochistic wish that Freud associates with femininity" (p. 3). The latter is evident in poems which "idealize the 'passive glory' attained by the crucified</page><page sequence="38">230 / VICTORIAN POETRY (symbolically castrated) Son" (p. 3). Moder concludes that Hopkins "grappled valiantly with the problems of psychical androgyny, manic/ melancholic mood swings, oedipal guilt, homosexual orientation, and conflicting wishes for punishment and reward" (p. 16). An equally shocking, sometimes dazzling, sometimes perverse account of Hopkins' "masochism" (p. 107) is Trevor McNeely's "psychosexual" critique, "The Blissful Agony of Hopkins: Notes of a Neo-Reactionary" (HQ 12 [1985-86]: 97-1 14). For McNeely Hopkins' attraction to pain is the key to a "comprehensive aesthetic theory" of his art (p. 102). McNeely identifies "masochism" as the "principal source of tension" (pp. 98, 99), of moral and intellectual ambiguity, in Hopkins' poetry, as well as the reason for his lack of publication, his tortured style, and his fascination with danger. McNeely finds that Hopkins' "willingness to risk everything morally makes him a great Christian," but that his closest affinities are with Whitman and Swinburne, "another indication that his true position, critically speaking, is indeed with his own century, and more specifically with its decadent avant- garde wing," which includes other disciples of Pater such as Francis Thompson and Lionel Johnson (pp. 110, 100, 101). While I am not persuaded by some of his arguments, I find thought-provoking his suggestions that "the true basis of Hopkins' aesthetic ... is emotional rather than intellectual"-, that Hopkins' "whole theory of prosody" is "an elaborate evasion of what is based simply on feeling and spontaneity"; that Hopkins did not so much rebel against Jesuit discipline as see it as a temptation to a vice in himself; and that his bitter taste of self in the late sonnets was "his choice" (pp. 102, 100, 108). Another essay that calls for a reevaluation of Hopkins is Donald Walhout's "Modes of Religious Response in Hopkins's Poetry" (HQ 12 [1985-86]: 83-93). For Walhout Hopkins is "a major religious poet" because, in addition to the desolation and recovery that Walhout analyzed in Send My Roots Rain (1981), he now identifies fourteen other modes of religious response in Hopkins' poetry - every mode one could expect of a Christian except mysticism. The relation between religion, philosophy, and poetry is the subject of Hilary Fraser's chapter, "Epistemology and perception: Gerard Manley Hopkins," pp. 67-106 of her Beauty and Belief: Aesthetics and religion in Victorian literature. Fraser points out that the sacramental poets who preceded Hopkins, "such as Vaughan, Traherne, and Wordsworth," "did not seem to offer a specifically Christian concept of nature" (p. 69). For Hopkins, however, "the distinctiveness of certain forms . . . was explained by their resemblance to the uniqueness of Christ's inscape" (p. 70). Fraser also argues that "Hopkins transforms Kantian subjective Idealism, as he transformed the sacramental poetic tradition, by making it Christocentric"</page><page sequence="39">JEROME BUMP / 231 (p. 100). Scotus is cited as often as Kant, however, and his concept of the species specialissima, "a term which implies a concurrent awareness of the thing as species and as individual" leads Fraser to an interesting interpreta- tion of "Buckle!" in "The Windhover": "The universal categories that the bird embodies collapse and synthesise in the distinctive individuality of its inscape" (p. 87). Another useful insight in this chapter, it seems to me, is that "for Hopkins the idiosyncrasy of his own diction, the many eccentricities . . . may be related to the fact that the soul of their utterance is Christ. . . . Hopkins wrote, 'each poet is like a species in nature.' ... As such, the inscape of the poet/genius is the closest human approximation to Christ, whose humanity was a perfect whole species unto itself (p. 103). Alan Heuser, to whom Fraser is indebted (pp. 92-93), returned to Hopkins studies with a stimulating comparative essay: "Creaturely Inseeing in the Poetry of G. M. Hopkins, D. H. Lawrence, and Ted Hughes" (HQ 12 [1985]: 35-51). These "nature-poets" can "read nature and her creatures . . . because nature is 'charged with grandeur' . . . of some heroic vision, if not of God, then of some heroic value" - "passionate love in heroic marriage" for Lawrence, "the bare hunting instinct" for Hughes (pp. 46, 38, 42). Heuser's comparison seems particularly valuable to me because, like Sigurd Burck- hardt's "Poetry, Language, and the Condition of Modern Man" (CRAS 4 [I960]: 1-15),1 he traces a progression due in part to "accelerating scientism and technology" that led "successive poets from higher to lower goals," and from Hopkins' emblems "in which complexities have been drawn into unity," to Lawrence's "unfolding in a multiplicity of transformational metaphors and similes," to Hughes' reduction of this "kind of process poetry" to its "simplest terms" (pp. 46, 40, 43). Another recent comparative essay is Marietta Patrick's " 'A Sea of Glass Mingled with Fire': Hopkins and Vaughan" (HQ 12 [1985]: 5-16), which focuses on fire, light, blood, and water imagery in both poets. Some of the parallels seem more appropriate for Hopkins' poems of the 1860s, which are ignored, but affinities are established with a poet usually neglected in discussions of Hopkins and the Metaphysicals. Vaughan's use of the verb "hurl" is cited by Graham Storey in "The Poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins: 'Catching the Demi-Urge in the Act" (PBA 70 [1984]: 132-148). Storey demonstrates convincingly that Ernest Fenollosa's The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry, which also inspired Donald Davie's Articulate Energy, supports Hopkins' dis- regard for conventional grammar and his use of transitive verbs which recognize " 'nature as a vast storehouse of forces' " (p. 132). *Rpt. as "Poetry and the Language of Communion" in Geoffrey H. Hartman's Hopkins: A Collection of Critical Essays (Englewood Cliffs, 1966), pp. 160-167.</page><page sequence="40">232 / VICTORIAN POETRY In addition to such comprehensive essays, as usual many articles appeared about individual poems. "The Windhover" continues to be a locus classicus. Heuser and Patrick focus on it, as does Robert Boyle in "Hopkins, Brutus, and Dante" (FP24: 1-12). Boyle traces the progress of his responses to the poem from his initial impression that a bird "somehow got mixed in with a plough and bled to death" (p. 1) to his current esoteric exploration of the verbal associations of the red and gold "oriflamme" banner of dauphins and the word "brute" in the Bible, Dante, Shakespeare, Ignatius, "The Wreck of the Deutschland," and especially Welsh. Patrick also points to Welsh, suggesting that because it "has no neuter gender" it helped Hopkins and Vaughan perceive the "animation of all things" (p. 6). Such hints demonstrate the need for a more extensive study of connections of this kind between Hopkins' poetry and Welsh. Progress is already apparent in our understanding of the role of Latin poetry in Hopkins' life and art. Rosemary Nielsen and Robert Solomon, in "Horace and Hopkins: The Point of Balance in Odes 3.1" (RAMUS 14.1 [1985]: 1-15), show how Hopkins' translation of Horace's Odes 3.1 ("Tread back - and back") "reveals a profound identification with Horace . . . and an intense revelation of the mind of Hopkins (p. 2). In addition, Norman MacKenzie, in "Hopkins and Horace - A New Discovery" (ELN 23.3: 41-42 [an abstract of his article in CML 5.1 {1984}: 7-11]), also focuses on an apparent translation from Horace ("Not kind! to freeze me!"). By identi- fying this poem not as evidence of Hopkins' personal attachment to Digby Dolben but as a translation of Horace's Odes 2.17, some of the speculation about Hopkins' emotional life needs to be revised. A more popular poem in Hopkins scholarship last year was "That Nature is a Heraclitean Fire." Patrick focuses on it, as does James Finn Cotter in "Apocalyptic Imagery in Hopkins' 'That Nature is a Heraclitean Fire and of the comfort of the Resurrection" (VP 24: 261-274). Countering the usual emphasis on Greek philosophy in studies of this poem, Cotter ably explores the significance - on the literal, metaphorical, moral, and anagogi- cal levels of meaning - of the typological imagery in the poem inspired by St. John's Apocalypse and its prototypes. In "Frozen Fire: the Paradoxical Equation of 'That Nature is a Heraclitean Fire and of the comfort of the Resurrection'" (HQ 12 [1985-86]: 65-79), Rachel Salmon continues her valuable synchronic readings of Hopkins' poems begun in VP(22 [1984]: 383-406). Salmon is "one who does not share [Hopkins'] specific theological beliefs, and who, therefore, does not seek an entrance into his work through his biography" (p. 65). Nevertheless, she focuses on two different kinds of Ignatian meditations, corresponding to the affective and elective wills, the "nature" sonnets and the "terrible sonnets." She finds both dichotomies reconciled in this poem</page><page sequence="41">BENJAMIN FRANKLIN FISHER IV / 233 in "a basic theological structure - paradox" that even "a non-Catholic reader can participate in (and not merely acknowledge intellectually)" (p. 75). Unfortunately, space does not permit review of the briefer articles on other poems and aspects of Hopkins' life and art which appeared in 1986, and our limits will become even more strained as we begin to survey the flood of publications planned for the centenary of Hopkins' death in 1989. Already two books demand attention in the 1987 review, and by 1989 we expect the variorum edition of Hopkins' poems, Norman White's biog- raphy, and the various collections of essays now being solicited, including the special issue of TSLL timed to coincide with the 1989 Hopkins Centenary Exhibition organized by Carl Sutton, President of the Inter- national Hopkins Association, to be held at the University of Texas at Austin. The Poets of the Nineties Benjamin Franklin Fisher IV Three books and an article comprise this year's peaks. First, anyone interested in A. E. Housman ought to read the catalogue for an exhibit of his works and Housmaniana sponsored by the Bryn Mawr College and Morgan Libraries. Manuscripts, letters, and books, principally those acquired over a Jong life in collecting by the late Philadelphia bibliophile, Seymour Adelman, are represented. Adelman's holdings are now at Bryn Mawr College. More than once since I undertook this survey, I have commented on mergers of literary with other arts that recurred in the nineties. Therefore I am gratified by current studies that continue reasonably in tightening such relationships. Moreover, recent critiques do not overlook music and its relatives, opera and dance. Older views of the nineties, which often concentrated on biographical sensationalism or else with ease dismissed what they perceived as the lightweight writers and other artists from those times, must now give way to increasingly sharper awarenesses of subtle ties and significances that infiltrate poetics in this period. Linda Gertner Zatlin's study of Beardsley 's bawdy ( VN 67 [ 1 985] : 1 -6), noticed last year, has a fine companion in Ian Fletcher's "A Grammar of Monsters: Beardsley's Obsessive Images and Their Sources" (ELT30: 141-163). In concise form it</page><page sequence="42">234 / VICTORIAN POETRY orders in sensible terms the interrelatedness of Beardsley's drawings, literature, music, and drama. Fletcher makes good sense in discussing the warhorse icons of fetuses, fatal women, monkeys, dwarfs, hermaphrodites, Pierrots, masks, and divided selves. As they link with these figures, sex, psychology, and humor receive sensible commentary. As if he had looked over Fletcher's shoulder, albeit from the angle of painting and, to a lesser degree, sculpture, Bram Dijkstra also assesses bonds between literary and visual arts in Idols of Perversity: Fantasies of Feminine Evil in Fin-de-Siecle Culture. This book ranges over the art world during the "transition" (from Victorian to modern) era, 1880-1920. Dijkstra's pan- orama includes Continental and some American works, and it analyzes much that reached a zenith during the nineties. Threatening females - frightening because their sexuality (unfathomable and apparently uncon- trollable) strikes at the core of male physique, emotions, and occupations - are placed against traditions that were revaluated by Victorians. These reinterpretations often drew upon scientific theory - for example, that from Darwinism, medicine, and psychology - theory more and more of concern to the middle class. Artists primed the pump, so to speak, in incorporating male misogynist fantasies within their works. Dijkstra's hypothesis - how women represented evil to the nineteenth-century male - is not new. His perceptions about the length to which Victorians took antifeminism, however, may startle some readers. Dijkstra examines much that appeared principally in visual arts but that was not absent from writing: flowers, water, the angel in the house, dance, music (notably Wagner's operas), classical deities and mythic figures elsewhere (Venus, Circe, Leda, satyrs, nymphs, fauns), Biblical lore (Judith, Lilith, Salome), monkeys and other animals (bulls, birds, horses, snakes, cats - from lions to domestic pets), androgynes, homosexuals, lesbians, vampires. Along with the overarching theme of Nature, all intertwine in Dijkstra's book. Poe, Tennyson, Baudelaire, Emily Bronte, Morris, the Rossettis, Swinburne, Ruskin, Le Fanu, Carroll, Lear, Wilde, Stoker, Symons: these writers, like painters, yield their quotients of pertinence to the woman question. "Question" is central under this rubric because of doubts and paranoias pervading male fantasies about women during this era. The role call of authors evinces great heterogeneity. Add to this list names of those who wrote or illustrated children's literature, or about the New Woman, or fashioned posters, and ramifications of antifeminism become more complex. Dijkstra synthesizes much thought and secondary writing; consequently, to some his book may seem unoriginal. Nonetheless, Idols of Perversity affords a good primer for much-vexed, many-sided cultural problems. My sole caveat is that Poe's importance for decadence is mentioned several times but without supportive elaboration to clarify his signal place.</page><page sequence="43">BENJAMIN FRANKLIN FISHER IV / 235 Linda Dowling's Language and Decadence in the Victorian Fin de Siecle aligns fittingly with Fletcher and Dijkstra. She begins with no-nonsense, critical-historical chartings of poetics from Coleridge (and gives attention to his predecessors in these matters) through Yeats regarding the fusings of or oppositions dividing written and spoken expression. Dowling interprets literary Decadence in the late nineteenth century not as sensationalizing biographical approaches to Wilde or Beardsley but as a demonstration of counterpoetics that challenged the moral force underlying the Romantic ideal of language. Romantic theory led to Victorian "standards of public discourse," which gave no quarter to immorality, obscenity, or idiosyncracy. This outlook accounts for negative reactions to the Spasmodics, Pre- Raphaelites, and Decadents; their "private or purely expressive use of language" caused ill regard. An irony in the scientific treatment of philology in Victorian years was the conclusion that language is rooted in sounds and is therefore impersonal. Thus a conflict over written versus spoken expression arose, and the outcome promoted a questioning that weakened previously accepted poetic traditions. Not the Tennyson generation, but the next two suffered debates contrasting bookish or literary with oral or natural (with kudos to the latter, and that often carried to the nth degree of downright primitivism by certain poets). The term "Decadence" originates in the Victorians' reiterated analogies between their own and Roman civilization. Many purists about standards in the English language took alarm when the OED (1884) drew upon sources like newspapers for illustrating and clarifying definitions. For nineties writers, the great polestars of literature were Pater in prose and Swinburne (of Poems and Ballads, first series) in verse. Pater's work, often loosely interpreted, led to emphases on sensations and impressions; Swinburne's to the poem as song. Disciples eagerly experimented with primitivism in their writing. Dowling provides compelling readings of nineties poems. Dowson, Johnson, Davidson, Symons, and Yeats are her chief quarry. Their experiments, for purposes of combining traditional poetic elements with what they found fresh and vital on the contemporary scene, produced fascinating work. Dowling comes to sensible grips with these poetics. Johnson and Dowson, within such contexts, seem close to classicism (not too close). Conversely, Davidson and Symons reveal a greater primitivism. Paradox and parody repeatedly surface in literary Decadence. Relevance of the English music hall to nineties poetics receives just dues (with terse respects paid to counter-decadents Henley and Kipling along these lines). Thence we go no great distance to dance motifs in Symons and Yeats. Yeats ultimately moved beyond his long held regard for Symons, leaving the latter's limited "fleeting sensuous impressions." Centrality of gesture over speech or sound makes much nineties writing a signal antecedent of</page><page sequence="44">236 / VICTORIAN POETRY Modernism in English poetry, and the names of Pound and Eliot occur significantly if briefly here. Not confined to verse, the concept of a "fatal book," which gained visibility in Pater and loomed disturbingly in Wilde, Moore, and others, also gets penetrating scrutiny. Finally we see Yeats turning from folk tradition as it spurred, among other developments, balladry during the nineties, toward a more formalized expression that allowed encompassing written literary tradition, and then ultimately according high place for oral foundations in literature. More than any other from the Rhymers' Club ambience, Yeats moved beyond the nineties milieu. Yet he continually recalled its impact. To conclude. What I have surveyed here gives an undeniable value to the poets of the nineties. Modes of parody and counterpoetics coursing through their works run into subsequent movements in English literature. Supposed contraries will no longer seem so far apart after one reads studies like those examined above. For example, Dijkstra's observations on painting make equally plausible sense of the power underlying Ella D' Arcy's famous first story in The Yellow Book, "Irremediable." There, as in numerous paintings, we find a horrifying circumstance of a mismatch in marriage, with an overpowering wife sure to cause her husband's downfall. A like construct, as it is offered by Dowling, makes Dowson's renowned "Cynara" more accessible (in pointing out the varied kinds of intoxication, as revealed in the subtle wordplay and images). Finally, Beardsley's notorious cover on the front of volume I of The Yellow Book, with its learing fat woman and weird dark male figure, admits yet another interpretation after one consults this year's studies. Power in that graphic resides in fantasy and (implied) gesture instead of speech. The Pre-Raphaelites Carole Silver On this twenty-fifth birthday of Victorian Poetry &gt; research in the realm of Pre-Raphaelitism, though not necessarily about the poetry inspired by the movement, is more abundant than ever. The last two years have seen the publication of a number of books on members of the Pre-Raphaelite Circle - books that touch upon previously unexamined areas and explore lesser known figures or that study the works of major figures from fresh</page><page sequence="45">CAROLE SILVER / 237 perspectives. Whatever their weaknesses, all the volumes discussed here have provided scholars with new materials or new grounds for speculation. Dolores Rosenblum' s Christina Rossetti: The Poetry of Endurance, a textual analysis of Rossetti's poetry in the light of recent feminist theory and criticism, is the first full-length book of its kind. Tracing the sources of Rossetti's female aesthetic and discussing its connections with the verse of earlier poets such as L. E. L. and Felicia Hemans, Rosenblum demonstrates how an "aesthetic of renunciation" results in a "poetry of endurance" (p. 5). Rosenblum argues that such a poetic functions through the reiteration and codification of previously used forms and themes and through the mimicry of elements drawn from the male tradition. The book is original in establishing and tracing the recurring female personae and the essential motifs that pervade the poems. It examines Rossetti's all-encompassing metaphor of sight and stresses the impact of figures like the seer who is simultaneously the object seen, the nun, and the woman of stone; it demonstrates the interplay of dominant patterns including those of appetite and sufficiency, feast and famine, the garden and the wasteland. Rosenblum's approach to individual poems is less impressive than her insight into the total canon, but her biographical speculations on Rossetti's relations with her mother and with her painter-poet brother are provocative. The weakness of her book lies in its sometimes ponderous prose style and her tendency to obfuscate rather than clarify specific points of interpretation for fear of being "reductive." Yet, despite these limitations, The Poetry of Endurance provides significant insights into Rossetti's mind and art. The Pre-Raphaelite Sisterhood (1985), by Jan Marsh, suffers from the opposite problem; while lively and readable, it is superficial in approach. Ostensibly feminist, this book is a first attempt to reveal the lives and personalities behind the impassive faces of the famous models of the Pre- Raphaelite Circle. In her desire to reveal the models' "active struggle for identity and self-determination" (p. 359), Marsh collects most of what is known about Elizabeth Siddal, Jane Burden (Morris), Georgiana Mac- donald (Burne-Jones), and Fanny Cornforth. She adds to readers' knowl- edge of the lives of relatively obscure figures like Emma Hill (Brown) and Annie Miller and enriches our sense of the milieu of others, explaining, for example (in reference to Siddal), how milliners were trained. But Marsh seldom illuminates the biographical problems she encounters, at times making extravagant claims for the women's influence, at others, under- valuing their contributions. It is difficult to believe - without substantial evidence- that Jane Morris was the aggressor in her affair with Dante Gabriel Rossetti or that Georgiana Burne-Jones led William Morris to socialism. Marsh has little to say about the literary and artistic work of</page><page sequence="46">238 / VICTORIAN POETRY Siddal and of Georgiana Burne- Jones and even less to say about the actual work of modeling or the professional interactions between models and Pre-Raphaelite painters. She does not fully explore the ways in which the models' faces, forms, and dress influenced other women or Victorian ideals of beauty. Nevertheless, in gathering and making accessible information previously found only in disparate sources or fragmentary form, Marsh has laid the foundation for future research. The solid, careful building of evidence lacking in Marsh's book exists in plenitude in Peter Stansky's Redesigning the World: William Morris, the 1880s, and the Arts and Crafts. Stansky centers his volume on the English arts and crafts movements of the 1880s and evaluates the role of William Morris in them; ultimately, he finds Morris important less for his actual practice than for his value as a cultural symbol. Examining figures including Walter Crane and Arthur Mackmurdo, organizations including the Art Workers Guild and the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, and periodicals including the Hobby Horse and the Studio, Stansky provides readers with masses of new information. Sections on the structure, function, and leadership of various crafts organizations seem almost too detailed and specific. But the book has broader implications, though they are often sketched rather than fully limned, for Stansky reveals a series of important connections between British politics and aesthetics. He suggests, for instance, that political and aesthetic dissatisfaction went hand in hand to create a revolutionary change of taste in the 1880s. Stansky argues, thoroughly and persuasively, his thesis - that the way we view the world, our sense of how it should look, was altered in the 1880s and that Morris' influence was a major component of that alteration. A further awareness of Morris' central role in areas including but subsuming design results from perusing Gary L. Aho's bibliography, William Morris: A Reference Guide. If the volume is not the first critical guide to materials about Morris, it is far and away the most comprehensive. Covering the period from 1897 to 1982, the book incorporates materials from previously published bibliographies, updates them, and even mentions doctoral dissertations and exhibition catalogues. Aho's twenty page intro- duction is valuable in itself, both as a study of the waxing and waning of Morris' reputation as a socialist, designer, and literary artist and as a commentary on the major scholarly contributions to Morris studies. The annotations of individual books and articles are crisp and authoritative, and author and subject indices add to the utility of the volume. The Guide suffers from an undistinguished format and from small, pale typescript, but its contents are well worth the extra effort such script demands. In closing, it is worth noting that a volume containing many of the poems of Christina Rossetti, a few of Elizabeth Siddal's, and a sampling of</page><page sequence="47">JOSEPH SENDRY / 239 William Morris' is again in print, in paperback - hence affordable - form. It is The Pre-Raphaelites, edited by Jerome H. Buckley. Buckley's 1968 introduction remains apt and insightful, and his bibliographical note has been updated. Though selections from such figures as Morris are too sparse, the volume makes available some of the less accessible poems of peripheral Pre-Raphaelites, including selections from the poetry of William Allingham and Philip Bourke Marston. The section on "Polemic, Parody [and], Criticism," which reprints Buchanan's "The Fleshly School of Poetry," D. G. Rossetti's retort, "The Stealthy School of Criticism," and an amusing parody of the latter's "Sister Helen," by Henry Duff Traill, is alone worth the price of the volume. Tennyson Joseph Sendry The harvest of Tennyson scholarship for the past year has been abundant: five books are reviewed here along with a generous selection from a larger- than-usual crop of articles. More than any other poem, this has been the year of Maud. In his book Alan Sinfield declares it to be the test case in any final verdict on Tennyson, and in hers Linda K. Hughes singles it out as the culmination of the poet's lifelong work in the dramatic monologue. The early deadline for this summer issue has, however, forced me to splatter these leaves before the mellowing year and so to pass over for now, because it arrived too late for inclusion, the most important contribution on Maud published in 1986, Susan Shatto's definitive edition. I must also pass over Alasdair W. Thomson's The Poetry of Tennyson, which appeared last year in England. It is, as Thomson remarks in his preface, a book for the general reader, and I must limit this space to work intended for scholars. To the growing volume of material in print on Tennyson's family and friends, John O. Waller has added a biography of Edmund and Henry Lushington, A Circle of Friends: The Tennysons and the Lushingtons of Park House. As Waller observes in his preface, "It must necessarily be as an extension of Tennyson's biography if the Lushingtons' memories are to be revived." Edmund is, of course, best known to readers of Tennyson for his appearance in Section LXXXV of In Memoriam as the friend somewhat apologetically invited to fill Hallam's place and then more prominently as bridegroom to his sister Cecilia in the closing epithalamium. Henry, whom</page><page sequence="48">240 / VICTORIAN POETRY Tennyson once called "the best critic he had ever known," died in 1855 after a chronic intestinal disorder and is memorialized poetically by "In the Garden at Swainston." Park House, the Lushington family home in Kent, is the setting for The Princess, and if we think of it at all, it is probably as a congenial retreat where the poet and his wife could enjoy warm hospitality. The domestic life of Edmund and Cecilia Lushington turned out, however, to be anything but sunny. They suffered the early deaths of three of their four children and lived apart much of the time, not only during academic years when Edmund was lecturing at Glasgow but also when Cecilia would vacate Park House because the quarters were too close for her and her husband's three sisters. Waller's book is reminiscent of Sir Charles Tennyson's biography of his grandfather: unpretentious, well-researched, clearly written, reluctant to pursue psychological speculation. Besides adding background detail to the poet's biography from Cambridge onwards, it gives some information on the genesis of the poems and might conceivably provide material for feminist inquiries into Victorian domestic life. After Maud, "Tithonus" is the poem most noteworthy for the scholarly attention it attracted last year. Evidence of its continuing appeal and relevance in our time was provided in a back-handed way by James J. Lynch in "Tennyson's 'Tithonus,' Huxley's After Many a Summer and Waugh's The Loved One" (SAR 51: 31-47). Though Lynch deals only briefly with "Tithonus," he does show how Huxley and Waugh appropriated specific emphases in Tennyson's reworking of the classical material: "the myth of a man who sought immortality from a sun-goddess serves as an ironic analogue for the characters' search for immortality in California - the land of the setting sun - and thus an appropriately ironic setting for their futile quest." Geoffrey Ward's article, discussed below, further evinces Tenny- son's contemporaneity by arguing that "Tithonus" anticipated in the concrete an insight propounded in the abstract by the seminal French critic Maurice Blanchot. In their books Albright, Hughes, and Sinfield consider "Tithonus" as monologue, as does Daniel A. Harris in Tennyson and Personification: The Rhetoric of "Tithonus, " which surely must be the most sustained treatment that the poem has ever received. If Harris is right, "Tithonus" deserves the attention it is now getting. He claims for it a central position not only in Tennyson's career-long involvement with personifica- tion but also in the history of that trope in English poetry and more generally in nineteenth-century speculations on the embodiment of spirit in matter. In English poetic history as Harris interprets it, Tennyson moves beyond an earlier notion of personification as the rhetorical device that assigned a strictly limited range of vital attributes to nonliving entities, the practice that Wordsworth deplored in his Preface of 1800. To describe the</page><page sequence="49">JOSEPH SENDRY / 241 personification that Tennyson himself practiced, Harris draws on various eighteenth-century theorists, whose formulations led into Arthur Hallam's views, particularly in his essay "On Sympathy." Invoking Hallam's idea that "erotic self-devotion" is the basis of prosopopoeia, Harris explains that in this model personification would involve not only projecting one's own qualities onto the other (making the other a "simulacrum" of oneself) but also assuming oneself the qualities of the other. Thus Tithonus begins by conceiving the dawn in his own bodily image ("lucid outline") and ends by "depersonating himself," that is, turning himself into what he made the dawn, a personification ("immortal age"). The poem thus enacts, indeed parodies, the very process of personification, implicitly criticizing Hallam as it does so. Like Tithonus' mode of existence the process is self-referential, endlessly repetitive, and - where the personifler is concerned - self-destruc- tive. As the genre in which "Tithonus" is cast, Harris finds the dramatic monologue the appropriate form for Tennyson's skeptical outlook - "a form predicated on loquacity" whose necessarily silent auditor is constructed by the speaker. In the latter half of his study Harris probes the complexity that arises from (the phrase is Locke's) the "double conformity" at work in "Tithonus," a need to encompass within one trope the dawn as natural phenomenon and Dawn as personification. That the personified Dawn is also a goddess adds one more level of complexity . Tennyson's poetic model is "To Autumn," where Keats took tentative steps toward delineating a personified goddess, one whose identity like that of Dawn is unfolded within a determinate span of time. But Harris sees "Demeter and Persephone," presented from the goddess' vantage and adapting Keats's language, as a more systematic elaboration of "To Autumn" than "Tithonus," one that telescopes a Keatsian vision of fallen Olympians into a Victorian anticipation of a fallen Christianity. If these performances give Harris evidence for crediting Tennyson with a major role in revitalizing personification as a rhetorical trope in the nineteenth century, the multiple status of dawn/Dawn as natural phenom- enon, personification, and goddess provides the opening for his much larger claim - that "Tithonus" occupied a "central position in its own culture." Through an intricate semiotic analysis Harris elaborates an analogy between on one hand the Dawn's simultaneous existence within the trope as goddess and natural phenomenon and on the other the presence of Christ in the Eucharistic bread and wine as that doctrine was explained by Tractarian theologians of the 1830s and the 1840s. He then finds that Tractarian thinking leads by way of "Tithonus" (1860) to Edward Burnett Tylor's massive anthropological work, Primitive Culture (1871), which is allotted</page><page sequence="50">242 / VICTORIAN POETRY about three pages at the end of the study by virtue of its concern for "the modes by which spirits incarnate themselves to produce ... an animated image." Though this last argument is concentrated, sophisticated, and inge- nious, it is finally unconvincing, both for the exaggerated case it makes for the cultural centrality of "Tithonus" and in its own right. As a matter of history, for example, the Tractarian position on the Eucharist was scarcely a pivotal issue in Victorian thought, and as Donald Hair points out in an article discussed below, "Tennyson's typical concern is with conduct, not doctrine." In the matter of argumentation, Harris construes key terms so broadly that they can cover apples, oranges, and a good deal more. Taking anthropomorphism as ground for connecting literary personification and the Tractarian view of the Eucharist is as inconclusive as lumping the divinity of Dawn and of Christ under the same heading of "theology." Harris has drawn a brilliant parallel, but by definition parallel lines do not meet. On Tennyson as a poet of personification he has pertinent and provocative things to say. But the various parts of his analysis do not fit well together, and his extrapolations into cultural realms fall of their own weight. If in Daniel Harris' reading the title character of Tennyson's mono- logue "depersonates" himself in personifying the Dawn, Geoffrey Ward sees Tithonus' longing for death pointing in the reverse direction to the kind of choice that would make us human and ultimately release rather than block the poetic voice. In "Dying to Write: Maurice Blanchot and Tennyson's 'Tithonus' " (CritI 12: 672-687), he begins with Blanchot's observation in The Space of Literature that, contrary to received opinion, we do not necessarily struggle or rebel against death but may even celebrate it. Adapting the reasoning of Dostoevsky's Kirilov from The Devils, Blanchot made the issue either that of accepting the fate - including immortality - that is given one or that of evading it, if necessary through suicide, a choice that would "dethrone God and liberate death." Ward finds the poet anticipating Blanchot's (and Dostoevsky's) insight in "Tithonus," whose title character is poised to make such a choice. In Ward's argument, however, death is not confined to physical extinction but may also include "death's analogues: madness, trance, divisions and questionings of the self." Rilke provides the self-reflexive link between death and poetry glanced at in the title. As interpreted by Blanchot, the German poet directs himself to a quest within, seeking death there in some form of the other, something he names Orpheus, the source of his song. Orpheus appears several times in Daniel Albright's book Tennyson: The Muses9 Tug-of-War, not as an explorer of the underworld within, but as "the singer who can shape a world to his liking." In framing his thesis Albright follows the well-established critical strategy of positing two Tennysons,</page><page sequence="51">JOSEPH SENDRY / 243 varying that theme by having the poet's strength arise from the tension between opposing aspects of himself. Orpheus is part of the Tennyson who seeks sublimity and whom he named Urania in In Memoriam. As the heavenly Muse, Urania disdains nature and everyday life, makes myths, transforms the world (Orpheus applies here) into grander, more ethereal forms, and releases the bounded self into boundless time and space. The other side of Tennyson, who can take the shape of the earthly Muse Melpomene, discredits Uranian grandiloquence and idealism, holding to a mimetic art that values the individual, the historical, the finite, the commonplace. In the juvenilia Albright traces the poetic means that Tennyson devised to generate sublimity and used for the rest of his career: derangement (a rough equivalent would be that "he sees himself in all he sees") and detachment (withdrawal from the ordinary world into one shaped by art). In such works as "The Lady of Shalott" and "The Palace of Art" from the 1830 and 1832 volumes Tennyson begins the Muses' tug-of-war in earnest by bringing sublimity under criticism. Albright locates the most productive struggles between the two Muses in the dramatic monologues and in the three major poems of Tennyson's mid-career (discussed in reverse order): Maud, In Memoriam, and The Princess, He describes "the innermost subject of most of Tennyson's monologues" as a paradoxically intense moment of individuality that arrives just as the character is about to lose itself into infinity. But prompted by the contrary impulse, Tennyson typically draws back from the brink. In Maud the protagonist is mythologized into Adonis, but only by half. In In Memoriam Urania is always restrained in her flights, even in the expansive though finally qualified epilogue, by the earthbound Melpomene. And the multifarious elements comprising the medley that is The Princess hold each other mutually in check. Albright devotes an entire section at the center of his book to Tennyson's dramatic monologues. Linda K. Hughes devotes a whole book to the subject. The Manyfacbd Glass: Tennyson's Dramatic Monologues (1987). When I began writing this annual survey in 1976, 1 urged that we needed a larger, more neutral definition of dramatic monologue that could account for both Tennyson and Browning without prejudicing the case toward either. In her opening chapter Hughes has provided what I hoped for and in so doing has also given us one of the most substantial contributions to the last several years' Tennyson scholarship. Her conceptualization accom- modates both the older formalist ideas and Langbaum's sympathy-versus- judgment scheme. It also accommodates both Langbaum's contention that the dramatic monologue is a recent, that is post-Enlightenment, develop- ment and the opposing view that it goes back much farther, as Pattison has urged, as far back as the Greek idyll. Hughes has managed these</page><page sequence="52">244 / VICTORIAN POETRY accommodations by considering the genre to be possessed of many resources, which can be exploited in different degrees from work to work. She admits her indebtedness to Alan S infield's 1977 monograph on the dramatic monologue, particularly for his view that a poem of this type is a "feint" or lie: "it sets up a fictional speaker whilst claiming for him, by the use of the first person, real-life existence." Because the stress may fall with different weight upon the author of the monologue and the fictive character behind which the author stands, the "feint" serves for poems where we feel the poet dictates the words as well as for those where the speaker absorbs our attention because of its highly articulated fictive identity. If the "feint" distinguishes the dramatic monologue from other forms, Hughes con- vincingly argues that what distinguishes Tennyson's monologues from Browning's is that the former typically render consciousness (states of inward, often fluctuating awareness) where the latter present personality (the human agent oriented toward the world and those who inhabit it). The form is large enough to accommodate both types. These concepts provide the points of departure for Hughes's scrutiny of the monologues that Tennyson produced at all stages in his career. After some imperfect attempts in the juvenilia he first succeeds in rendering consciousness and achieving the "feint" in "Supposed Confessions." In the volumes of 1832 and 1842 he extends his range into mythic and contem- porary themes and engages his readers more fully by activating their sympathy (in the domestic monologues) or by inviting them to participate in bridging textual gaps. Through the play of a dramatic past against a narrative present and in the introduction of multiple perspectives these volumes also show Tennyson's heightened sensitivity to the formal poten- tialities of the dramatic monologue. Hughes believes that the major poems of the middle years then benefit from Tennyson's formal mastery. The Princess for its use of framing devices and of seven monologists as tellers of the tale and In Memoriam for its rendering of consciousness and its exploitation of textual gaps. Maud exploits the multiple possibilities of the dramatic monologue to the fullest. Thereafter there is a falling off as Tennyson turns away from his forte, the rendering of consciousness. Nevertheless he can still produce some of his best work in the genre, poems such as "Tithonus," "Lucretius," "Rizpah," and "Demeter." Hughes analyzes consciousness through the formal components of the monologue - poet, speaker, reader, text. In discussing "Ulysses," for example, she works her way through the interplay of these elements, negotiates the gaps between one paragraph and another as they signal shifts in time and consciousness, and parses the verbs to show a progress from the enclosure of simple and habitual presents to open-ended infinitives. Albright by contrast deals in more global categories of consciousness.</page><page sequence="53">JOSEPH SENDRY / 245 "Ulysses," he urges, portrays "the trans-shifting of the speaker into another mode of existence." As the ordinary world, that of Telemachus, is left behind, Ulysses seems to become a disembodied "verbal creativity." The difference between the two critics is (to use Albright's distinction) rather like that between Melpomene and Urania. Hughes's more differentiated categories put us in closer touch with the text, yielding specific, more securely based - but, for all that, often brilliant - readings. Albright's approach is better adapted to catch larger resonances. His mythic treatment of "Demeter and Persephone," for example, conveys the power of that poem, where he hears an oceanic, godlike consciousness given human voice, in a way that Hughes's method does not. Albright is good on the larger contours of Tennyson's mind, as, for example, his reservations about the value of art or his anxiety about the implications of a Lucretian worldview. But I would go to Hughes to learn the dynamics of any particular monologue and of the monologue generally. Albright's volume, like Harris', was published within a series: Al- bright's, the first installment in Charlottesville's Virginia Victorian Studies and Harris', by the U.M.I. Research Press in its Nineteenth-Century Studies series. If these books are any indication, the editorial policies of the two series differ, and the difference will matter to those using them. Like other U.M.I, titles I have consulted, Harris' work is short (105 pages of text), narrowly focused, and heavily documented (endnotes run almost 30 pages or almost one-third the length of the text). Albright's takes in the poet's entire career in about 250 pages of text with few citations to scholarship. These few (the commentary in the Ricks edition is the favorite source) receive minimal notation in the margins. Hughes like Harris provides copious endnotes and unlike him a generous bibliography. Their engagement with the scholarship has obliged Harris and Hughes to generate conceptualizations of a high order. One feels, however, that Albright has cut corners, for example, when he asserts that In Memoriam is not an elegy. He advances an interesting position, but to have it carry authority, he would need to take some account of the excellent scholarship recently produced on In Memoriam as elegy (Peter Sacks, Peter Hinchcliffe, and A. Dwight Culler especially come to mind), and he would need a more highly articulated definition of the form than the one offered on the sole precedent of Spenser's "Daphnaida," "a machine to console" by the discharge of feeling. Largely unencumbered by scholarly apparatus, Albright's book compensates by being (a bit self-consciously) well written. But to Urania's bravura I prefer the more prosaic notes of Melpomene, notes such as concentration and clarity, of which Harris has the first and Hughes both. Similarly noteworthy for both clarity and concentration, Alan Sin- field's Alfred Tennyson also appears in a series, Rereading Literature, for</page><page sequence="54">246 / VICTORIAN POETRY which Terry Eagleton serves as general editor. According to the blurb on the cover "this series aims to show how the insights of Marxism, feminism and deconstruction open up exciting new ways of reading the major work of the most commonly studied writers." Sinfield himself is well known to Tennyson scholars both for his excellent book on In Memoriam (1971) and for the monograph entitled Dramatic Monologue (1977) that Hughes calls "the finest study of the genre to appear since Langbaum's." Sinfield's new book represents a fundamental departure from his previous work, which in some measure he repudiates. His view of language, for example, has undergone a reversal since the In Memoriam study, where he assigned a special status to poetry as "more densely structured than ordinary language." Sinfield now views this dense structure as the product of an ultimately doomed attempt by the poet to bridge the gap between language and the world by making his language appear to take in as much of the world as possible. In a similar deconstructionist move he proposes an alternative explanation of the dramatic monologue to his earlier one, the one that Hughes assimilated into her own explanation. In Sinfield's more recent view the dramatic monologue presents a consciousness focused neither in the author nor in the fictive character but rather dispersed. "Tithonus" he says, in one of the more significant discussions of that poem last year, "may be read ... as an exposition of anxiety about the constructedness of the self." As such the title character is reduced to "an effect of his positioning in time and space." Now even consciousness loses stability for Sinfield, who follows recent theory in denying autonomy to the subjective self. With it go the grounds on which the Romantics had based their claim to meaning, especially to transcendent meaning. Hence Tennyson's late Romantic struggles to apprehend the transcendent must fall short of success just as the nameless that he pursues must always lie beyond the reach of language. But Sinfield's strongest commitments are to Marxism rather than to deconstruction, and the declared purpose of his book is "to locate the text in its ideological field." Where Tennyson's role as poet is concerned, that field was dominated by utilitarianism, which forced him into two characteristic postures. The first, incorporation into prevailing power arrangements, meant his support of middle-class freedom; the second, acceptance of an assigned marginal status, meant that he restricted himself to politically harmless themes. Albright and Hughes make Tennyson's explorations of consciousness the basis of his poetic achievement: Sinfield takes them as proof of his cultural marginality. Though Tennyson raised some potentially subversive questions about gender in In Memoriam, he finally drew back (as his critic, who is refreshingly perceptive on this issue, does not). Maud then becomes the arena where the most complex and interesting ideological spectacles take place. Now the laureate, Tennyson knew what was expected</page><page sequence="55">JOSEPH SENDRY / 247 of him and delivered it - symbolism that links humankind with the world and heterosexual aggressiveness to replace the lurking androgyny of In Memoriam. But he delivers to excess, satisfying no one. Critical of the system (witness his protests against adulterated bread, and the rest), he still refuses to "set himself radically at odds with the dominant ideology." And so, declining a Shelley an role as advocate for political and imaginative freedom, he finds his own way of acting the bard by calling the nation to unity in the Crimean War. S infield organizes his book to address theoretical questions rather than to cover Tennyson's chronological development, but his close acquaintance with the poetry assures that it also is treated with insight. And though his critical perspective has changed, his ability to identify and explain the significance of complicated issues and to apply specialized concepts to the individual case (as he did earlier when he drew on linguistics to analyze In Memoriam) remains undiminished. These virtues will make the book especially useful to those unfamiliar with the intricacies of recent theory. But whatever one's theoretical orientation - or lack of it - this book will compel attention and provoke thought. It shouldn't be missed. S infield's puzzlement over Tennyson's intentions in Maud is not surprising; especially with respect to the glorification of war, this has been, as he is aware, a perennial response to the poem. In "Realism and Romance: The War of Cultural Codes in Tennyson's Maud" (VP 24: 69-82) Chris R. Vanden Bossche reviews the standard ways in which critics have dealt with its interpretive problems, then advances a solution of his own. The older of the prevailing readings is romantic in the chivalric sense of that term, taking the poem as a study in the power of love and the hero's regeneration through self-sacrifice in war. A newer, realistic interpretation construes the whole work as an exposure of the deranged hero's romantic delusions. Vanden Bossche himself aims for a higher synthesis in which romance and realism become themes in Victorian culture. To the Victorians romance would have been associated with chivalry, aristocracy, communitarian values, and the sheltered female realm of domesticity; realism, with a competitive male world, the cut-throat individualism of commercial life. Vanden Bossche argues that many of Tennyson's contemporaries saw the Crimean War in much the same romantic terms as the poem presents it, a kind of crusade that would cleanse the nation of greed. (Certainly Henry and Franklin Lushing- ton did. They believed, as their biographer points out, that to sue for peace before the Russians were defeated would have been "tantamount to base- ness . . . mammonism, the lust for getting on again with business as usual.") Romance, then, is neither exploded by realism nor subordinated to it, but used as the perspective from which to criticize the contemporary scene. Vanden Bossche's is an ingenious answer to the standing question about</page><page sequence="56">248 / VICTORIAN POETRY Maud but one that raises questions of its own. Sinfield has stressed that Maud left Tennyson's contemporaries as uneasy about the poem as we are, though perhaps for different reasons. We might ask why the cultural codes described by Vanden Bossche and available to the Victorians failed to satisfy so many of them. If S infield's book gives evidence of an acute ambivalence about Maud, sl chronic version of that attitude surfaced again in the year's work on the Idylls. Though both Albright and Sinfield produced general studies of the poet, both pointedly chose to exclude any consecutive treatment of Tennyson's longest work: Albright because he "could not bring [himself] to regard the Idylls of the King as an effort as coherent" as the three long poems of the middle period, and Sinfield, because he considers the task of performing a Marxist analysis on so safe a "negotiation of middle-class demands" to be "melancholy" and fruitless. One thinks of the partial and abbreviated discussions of the Idylls in other general studies of the poet (Shaw, Culler, and McSweeney, for example) and conversely, of the seven appreciative books that have appeared on the Idylls since the revival of interest in him. One of the ablest of the seven authors, John R. Reed, has written again on the Idylls, and his article is one of three substantial contributions produced on the poem in 1986. As his point of departure in "Tennyson's Narrative on Narration" (VP 24: 189-205) Reed invokes Hay den White's distinction among three types of historical writing: "annals that lack narrative, chronicles that are composed of incomplete narratives, and histories that depend openly on narrative." White believes that narrative itself is closely connected with a moralizing impulse, a belief that Reed thinks Tennyson both held and embodied in the Idylls. Reed scrutinizes the way Tennyson uses narrative as narrative and shows that he does so in an astonishing variety of ways. As Reed interprets them, the Idylls rehearse in literary terms the economists' formula of bad currency driving out good. The moral fables that are founded on Arthur's deeds and that prevail at the start of the Idylls progressively give way to false tales, fantasies, finally an inability to fashion narrative itself. Though the poem ends with the collapse both of the kingdom and of storytelling, Reed still detects an underlying note of affirmation, a confidence in the truth of narrative itself, sustained by and capable of sustaining deeds. William W. Bonney's article, " 'To-day Unsolders All': Tropology and History in Idylls of the King" (VIJ 14: 1 13-132) recalls Daniel A. Harris' monograph on "Tithonus." Like Harris, Bonney uses a master trope, in this case irony, as his way into a complex Tennyson poem. Like Reed he draws on Hay den White, along with other recent commentators of a deconstructive bent. In Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe White posited that "the explanatory strategies" available to the</page><page sequence="57">JOSEPH SENDRY / 249 historian are fundamentally the major tropes available to the poet: metaphor, metonomy, synecdoche, and irony. For White the ironic version of history de-reifies language, exposing contradictions and creating moral ambiguities. Applying these premises to the Idylls, Bonney argues that the "redemptive cultural order" Arthur seeks to establish is conveyed through "tropes whose vehicles denote upward expansion." In analyzing a succes- sion of tropes, however, Bonney shows that, as the poem proceeds, its language displays the contradictions and ambiguities that White had ascribed to irony, the trope that (in a phrase borrowed from "The Passing of Arthur") "unsolders all," whether the confident metaphors of Arthurian inspiration or the handiwork of Arthurian institutions. Though in "Tennyson's cThe Holy Grail': The Representation of Representation" (Renascence 38: 144-159) Howard W. Fulweiler pays primary attention to the idyll named in his title, he considers it the turning point of the whole work and uses Arthur's closing speech (which the poet called "the summing up of all") as an interpretive master key. Fulweiler complains that by confining their attention to the first half of the speech many critics have misinterpreted the idyll as "Tennyson's rejection of spiritual vision for Victorian practicality," ignoring Arthur's "hymn to the world of vision" in the last half. Fulweiler diagnoses the Knights' failures as failures in perception and interpretation. They take the Grail to be a thing - hence it becomes an idol or tool to be manipulated - instead of as a symbol, or even a Sacrament, opening onto another order of reality. Both Tennyson and Arthur would endorse a quest conceived in those terms. (Fulweiler believes that the Sacraments provide the historical foundation for the Romantic doctrine of symbolism.) As he finds Tennyson doing in the poem, Fulweiler takes the Grail to represent a participatory process by which the mind perceives or mentally represents reality (hence the "representation of representation" in his title). Also like Tennyson, he assimilates the way we perceive the Grail - or the world - or our mental representations of them - into a broader criticism of the culture. Taking his cues from Owen Barfield, he locates the source of modern alienation in our habit of regarding phenomena in the way that the failed knights regarded the Grail, as things that exist independent of human consciousness or imagination. We look, of course, to the Romantics for texts that support or refute the imaginative power of the mind and the mind's ability to connect with the natural world. Three studies from 1986 comment pertinently on Tennyson's relation to the Romantics in this respect. At least where the power of the imagination is concerned, Ashton Nichols corroborates Fulweiler in "The Ephipanic Trance Poem: Why Tennyson is Not a Mystic" (VP 24: 131-148). Nichols holds that in Tennyson's work visionary experience yields a sense of its own meaning, grounded in the world and shaped in</page><page sequence="58">250 / VICTORIAN POETRY words by the power of the mind. But Fulweiler might part company with Nichols when the latter denies that Tennyson was a mystic. In any event, Nichols is persuasive in arguing that the poet's true affinities are to Wordsworth and his "spots of time" and Browning and his "infinite moments." Since in a footnote Nichols cites William James to the effect that the mystical experience is itself ineffable, I was left wondering whether he thinks that mystical poetry is possible at all. If so, a few examples would have strengthened his case by way of contrast. Joanna E. Rapf arrives at different conclusions from Nichols on some of the same issues in " 'Visionaries of Dereliction': Wordsworth and Tenny- son" (VP 24: 373-385). Rapf s purpose is to show more how Tennyson is unlike Wordsworth than to trace similarities or establish a line of influence between them. As she sees our poet, he was - to his credit, she believes - never able to arrive at imaginative resolutions or a stable faith. Unlike Nichols' Tennyson, hers has an imagination ungrounded in sense experi- ence. Nor is the mind's power to connect with the world an issue to the poet, since he never made the Romantic assumption that it could do so. Donald Hair in "Tennyson's Faith: A Re-examination" (UTQ 55: 183-203) throws the question into a wholly different frame of reference. Tennyson, he argues, was concerned primarily not with how we know the world but with how we should live. Hair traces to Locke and to Coleridge two beliefs embedded in this concern. Hair thinks that Tennyson derived from Locke the conviction that faith is superior to knowledge because we can rely on faith to guide us in conduct. From Coleridge Tennyson would have received the idea that human needs give authority to specific tenets of our faith. Hair maintains that the principal source of the Coleridgean ideas that reached Tennyson was Aids to Reflection, reflection being a reciprocal relation with God. Reciprocity conceived in Coleridgean terms brings us back to Ful- weiler's contention, also derived from Coleridge, that the mind participates creatively in our representations of the world. And that brings us to a critical point in the year's work, in literary scholarship, and in the state of our culture itself. In a modest way Tennyson, as he was written about in 1986, found himself in the middle of it. At one extreme Sinfield describes the failure of the Romantic symbol - indeed, of language itself - to bridge human consciousness and the world, and he considers it a gain that Tennyson was becoming aware of this failure. At the other extreme Fulweiler shows Tennyson affirming the power of the imagination to build such bridges, and he considers it a loss that this power is not being exercised. The issues are not merely academic.</page></plain_text>
