<plain_text><page sequence="1">Advertising : Manipulative and Ethical Sirs: Drucker's It may latest be quite book, unnecessary The Practice for of me Management to call to , your but Dr. attention Rapoport's Peter Drucker's latest book, The Practice of Management , but Dr. Rapoport's reply to Mr. Schwab's letter (ETC., XII [1954], 73-76) stimulates thought on one or two points which Mr. Drucker makes. Our "capitalistic" system, as you well know, it not a static thing - profound changes are taking place in the thinking of many business leaders of the system. My observations - as a member of management and concerned with evaluating future prospects - lead me to believe that a growing number of business man- agers are moving away from the old notion that "in a capitalistic system, the chief, often the only, motivation for making and marketing products is profit." True, though an "adequate profit" is coming more and more to be regarded as 72</page><page sequence="2">autumn 1955 CORRESPONDENCE an essential "condition of survival" of an independent business in a "free enter- prise system," it is no longer thought of as a "basic purpose." The modus vivendi requires managers to be "profit oriented," but a top manager who be- lieves he has provided a significant and useful guide to his subordinates when he proclaims, "we are in business to make a profit," is a dodo without knowing it. The advice of a medical doctor: "you have to eat to stay alive," may occasion- ally be necessary for a disturbed patient. Similarly, a "disturbed" business may occasionally need a reminder of the function of profits in keeping a business going. Usually, however, such advice is not only superfluous but useless. The business organization exists to satisfy human needs - those of business personnel, the individual consumers, the body politic, and the owners and share- holders. But these needs are irreconcilably in conflict if they are considered only in terms of profits. A business organization is an ordering of human re- sources; and while anthropomorphism regularly inflicts grave injuries to under- standing, it may be helpful to think of a business enterprise as an organism for which profits are a minor but nonetheless essential element in nutrition. If one should decide that calories are the one and only need of the human body and thus concentrate on getting enough sugar - possibly the simplest source of calories - he would be behaving in a manner analogous to that of the manage- ment which conducts its business with only profits in mind. As Mr. Drucker forcibly points out, the opposite error must also be avoided. Range of authority and responsibility can become over-extended. A business may claim a more dominant position in a complex society than it is entitled to. Not only may it interfere unduly with employees' private lives, it may create false expectations by claiming responsibilities broader than it can satisfactorily discharge. After all, even in a "business society," business is only one of the orderings of human resources and, possibly, in the long-pull, not the most influential. So I wonder whether advertising people ought not to be directed by managers having not only broader responsibilities but broader vision. Isn't advertising, by its nature, a manipulative art? If so, will it not tend to transgress by seeking the simplest and "most effective" ways of gaining immediate goals without regard for what might be more fundamental? I have not thought deeply on this point, but I suspect that advertising is intrinsically incapable of self-policing. Can any manipulative art generate its own ethical controls? Our society, inevi- tably I suppose, has allowed its more proficient practitioners - those with the naturally excessive ebullience of the successful manipulator - to externalize their internal equation: "effective=good." The task, as I see it, is not that of changing the inevitable internal equation but, rather, reestablishing the ethical primacy of the external controllers. J. W.
