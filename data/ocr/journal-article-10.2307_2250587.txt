<plain_text><page sequence="1">II.-PSYCHOANALYSIS AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY: A REVIEW FROM THE STANDPOINT OF SCIENTIFIC EMPIRICISM. BY GUSTAV BERGMANN. THIS paper proposes to discuss from a purely methodological angle, with occasional references to the history of ideas, the relationship between psychoanalysis and what is usually called experimental or academic psychology. 'Methodology' is here -understood in that very general sense which is almost synonymous with the current expression 'philosophy of science'. Accord- ingly, the writer is neither an experimentalist nor a psycho- analyst, but a philosopher interested in the foundations of behaviour science; his epistemological frame of reference is thut of Logical Positivism (Scientific Empiricism). The dis- cuission, therefore, moves on a level of generality which, it is hoped, will justify its appearance Iin a philosophical magazine. But it must also be said that if terms like ' mechanistic ' and ' deterministic' have been used with the clear-cut meaning that they have in science, this should not be interpreted as a rejection of their more subtle epistemological analysis which the empiricist qua philosopher is also bound to perform. The point is that, from the standpoint of Scientific Empiricism,* those finer distinctions are alnost completely irrelevant to the methodological schema of contemporary behaviour science. If they are urged upon the scientist, this is usually done in order to make him subservient to some metaphysical residue. I. Psychoanalysis was and still is, for better or worse, not only a scientific approach, but also a cultural phenomenon of broader scope and rather deep impact. In this respect it is comparable to Marxism and Darwinism. These, too, in their times tran- scended the limits of their respective fields, and, partly as symptoms, partly as causal factors, played a very conspicuous role in the formation and transformation of our ideological structure. Small wonder, therefore, that men of letters and philosophers paid so much attention to psychoanalysis. From the scientist's viewpoint this attention has not always been very helpful; it has rather added to the confusion by emotionalizing and reading immediate cultural significance into scientific issues</page><page sequence="2">GUSTAV BERGMANN: EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY. 123 which, if at all, are only of indirect cultural impact. Let it be added, by way of clarification, that the kind of philosophy which most eagerly rallies atoiund or chooses to combat such move- ments has little to do with that very theoretical, entirely analytical, and entirely non-evaluative criticism of the sciences and of knowledge in general in which modern empiricism sees its main task. Thus I shall say very little about those broader implications of psychoanalysis or, to use Freud's own and very appropriate term, of the psychoanalytic movement; nor shall I say anythirig about the merits of psychoanalysis as a thera- peutic method, but, instead, proceed to characterize some of its more fundamental theoretical aspects. Within the broad and, as far as precise knowledge goes, still rather loose framework of the history of ideas, the rise and structure of -psychoanalysis seems to have been contingent upon and continuous with three main factors. These three factors, very different though not causally independent from each other, are: first, the group culture out of which it grew, second, those elements in, the nineteenth-century thought-pattern which are frequently referred to as Darwinism, and, third, and finally, certain trends in German metaphysical and literary philosophy which are best epitomized by such names as Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. Since the Viennese background is of merely anecdotal interest, I shall not say more about it.&gt; Freud himself, in his autobiography, has acknowledged the influence of Darwinism upon his thought. What I mean by Darwinism or, as I shall also call it, functionalism, is the repeated drawing upon the functional or adjustment aspect of acquired responses. The term ' functionalism ' is therefore used here in the specific sense in which it applies to a later American school of psychology. This group of psychologists, probably also under the cultural impact of Darwinism, mistook adjustment value for an explanatory concept, whatever this latter term ' ex- planatory concept ' might mean. For it is never the concepts which are explanatory, but only the laws and theories which are formulated in terms of these concepts. By laws I mean nothing but the regularities or correlations arrived at and generalized from observation, and by theory, roughly speaking, a logically integrated body of such laws. What the word 'logical' here refers to looks reasstxingly like a textbook of mathematics. This again by way of clarification and in contradistinction to certain types of traditional philosophy. The Darwinistic background is, I believe, responsible for one ,of the greatest virtues as well as for one of the most serious</page><page sequence="3">124 GUSTAV BERGMANN: limitations of psychoanalysis. The virtue I see in the hypothesis that the prime motivators, such as hunger, thirst, pain, avoidance, and sex, are the driving power, the sou'rce 6f energy behind the whole infinitely complex pattern of socio-psych6logical behaviour. It is only fair to say that psychoanalysis has pioneered by advancing this hypothesis on culturally tabooed grounds, but it is also true that this basic naturalistic assumption, as one might also call it, is nowadays not only common ground but commonplace for all behaviour sciences; And, what is more important, to-day it is also realized that expressions such as 'driving power' or 'source of energy', which have just been used, are, at best, loose and suggestive metaphors, not in them- selves blue-prints of a scientific theory. That psychoanalysts are not always too clear on this point just goes to show that they, too, form no exception from the familiar sociological phenomenon that the erstwhile pioneers end up -as stalwarts. I am-here, of course, referring to the confusion which surrounds such terms as 'instinct', 'drive', and 'libido' in the psycho- analytical literature and, worst of all, to the completely wild and irresponsible speculations of Ferenczi's bioanalysis. So the objection on this score would be, not that psychoanalysts are too naturalistic, but rather that they sometimes do not do a good job of being naturalistic. On the other hand, I am deeply suspicious of the adverse criticism which comes from those nicifiers who object to psychoanalysis because of its being what they call a drive psychology. By this they mean that psycho- analysis bases its explanatory attempts upon the prime motivators; what they'ignore, or want us to overlook, is that in this respect, psychoanalysis and contemporary experimental psychology do exactly the same thing. There is criticism and criticism. Writers like Miss Horney, as most clearly revealed by her criticism of the James-Lange theory on introspection- istic (!) grounds, are really fthe guardians of the good old spiritualistic tradition in philosophy, or, as psychoanalysts would phrase it, they are the carriers of the cultural resistance. I always feel. like reminding those ladies and gentlemen that painting a picture is still painting a picture, -in spite of the genetic connectiou which psychoanalysts claim to have discovered between these and other culturally less highly evaluated phenomena and activities. The values, after all, are not called into qcuestion if their occurrence is scientifically explained, and for the rest, one does not crusade for the place of variables in an explanatory schema. So there seems to be something wrong with the criticism from the right. The criticism from the left,</page><page sequence="4">PSYCHOANALYSIS -AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY. 125 .as one might call it, comes from experimental psychology and from those students of scientific empiricism who are interested in the methodology of the behaviour sciences. This tjype of criticism heartily endorses the naturalistic assumption of psycho- analysis; all it urges is to make the whole approach more and more concrete, less and less elusive and ambiguous; what it wants to promote is the integration of psychoanalysis, in a less sectarian and more democratic fashion, into the whole of our scientific knowledge. But to repeat again, the tough-minded naturalism which, historically speaking, psychoanalysis owes to its Darwinian background is, from this standpoint, one of its greatest virtues. The disadvantage inherited from the Darwinian outlook I see in the propensity to teleological thinking and in the tendency to take teleological patterns for scientific explanation. To be more explicit on this crucial point: tb,e observation that. a certain type of response has survival value, or, more specifically as psychoanalysts express it, can be understood in the psychic economy of their patients, might help to focus a problem, but does not yet constitute a scientific explanation. Such explana- tions are to be sought in terms of the mechanisms by which the habit in question is acquired, not in terms of the so-called aims which it serves. To put the same thing differently in order to avoid misunderstanding: to be sure, the behaviour of organisms shows the most marked teleological or purposive features, but eVery scientific account of them in teleological terms is neces- sarily very superficial, really a description rather than an explanation, a subjective account rather than an objective prediction. The task or, at least, the ideal and methodological standard of any science remains always to derive those teleolo- gical features within the frame of a causal mechanism. Therefore, again, the stricture against psychoanalysis which could' be made from the left is not that it is too mechanistic, but rather that, because of its immersion into functionalistic thought habits, it is not always mechanistic enough. The word 'mechanistic' is used in the very unphilosophical and very unemotional sense in which it is almost synonymous with 'scientific'. This time, too, I am rather confident that I express the general attitude of experimental psychology and again, I am afraid, I shall find myself in disagreement with writers like Miss Horney and the Gestalters. Two further clarifications are best inserted at this point. The one is a criticism of psychoanalysis, the other a criticism' of the nicifiers. Let us begin with the latter.</page><page sequence="5">126 GUSTAV BERGMANN: It is almost needless to say that al modern science is thoroughly. dctKrministic. What remains after this high-sounding word has been deflated is, first, that a science which is not able to predict from an appropriate set of data the future course of all its vari- ables has not yet solved its task, and, second, that 'there is no reason in heaven or ons earth why this aim should be in principle unattainable to the behaviour sciences. Quite to the contrary, though we do not have too much to show in the behaviour field so far, still the whole frame of reference of both contemporary science and empiricism points strongly towards such a deter- minism, this in spite of certain much misunderstood develop- ments in theoretical physics. Incidentally, one might add that whatever sense there is in the old metaphysical puzzle of the freedom of the will is completely safeguarded within the frame- work of such a scientific determinism, though the fear that such might not be the case provides one of the most powerful motives for all sorts of nicifiers, psychoanalytical or otherwise. 'What then is the meaning of the criticism that psychoanalysis is guilty of an entirely unjustifiable and destructive biological determinism? One must remember that only with this qualification as 'biolo- gical' has the objection any meaning, for without it the term 'cdeterministic', like 'mechanistic', means almost the same as ' scientific'. As far as I understand them, people who raise this kind of objection u'sually mean that psychoanalysis does not pay enough attention to the causal factors which are located in the organism's physical and social environment, and too much attention to' allegedly hereditary and the so-called biological factors, which latter term is used for the prime motivators. Thus formulated the objection undoubtedly makes sense, and I am iin no position to evaluate'it. Only, it appears that this is not a methodological question about, but a pragmatic question within science itself as to the actual success of hypotheses which attribute, loosely speaking, different weights to the various sets of variables. As to the actual position, of the psycho- analysts on this 'question, I am under the impression that our knowledge about the role of hereditary factors in personality development is still very rudimentary and that psychoanalysts, on the whole, have been rather careful not to commit themselves in either direction. As far as the environmental factors are concerned, psychoanalysis has, through the importance which it attributes to the family history and to' such culturally conditioned processes as sublimation, taken account of them on the very groundfloor of its structure. How inadequate this structure may be is a different question, but it certainly cannot</page><page sequence="6">PSYCHOANALYSIS AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY.. 127 be said that psychoanalysis has failed to provide for these factors within its systematic structure. There is, however, another aspect of this -criticism which deals with the historical character of psychoanalysis. To this crucial point I shall return later. Let me now turn to the last in this string of general remarks collected under the heading of Darwinism. This, as I have indicated before, is a stricture and not a defence of psycho- analysis. A direct comparison with so-called evolutionary theory will prove useful. In the generation of our parents Darwinism was often descried as a bold, all too bold theory, not sufficiently substantiated by facts and uncritically embraced for ulterior purposes by the radicals. As it presents itself to the modern methodologist, the situation shows, ironically enough, just the opposite picture. One can hardly think of a scientific fact better and more impressively documented than the phylog6netic hier- archy, established as it is by the threefold etvidence of embryology, comparative anatomy, and paleobiology. As to the facts, nothing or next to nothing is left to be desired. On the other hand, it seems that there is as yet'hardly any theory at all. For the ob- servation that the species best fitted to a certain environment will ultimately replace other less fortunate ones is either a pseudo-teleological truism or a tautology. This just illustrates the point which was made before concerning the superficiality of teleological accounts. The 'real problem is to discover the biological mechanisms or, as Freud would call them, dhemisms which regulate the transformation of species. A well-integrated body of such empirical laws, together with the data concerning the physical environment, would yield a causal account of the actual course the development of life has taken. This and only this would. deserve the name of a theory of evolution, and for such a theory, as we know, experimental biology as yet has hardly laid the groundwork. The analogy to psychoanalysis is obvious. Psychoanalysis, too, has discovered or rather, against the resistance of cultural taboos, forced our attention towards an impressive array of indisputablV facts, but it has, to my mind, achieved relatively little in the way of a satisfactory, verifiable theory. The facts I have in mind are those of so-called infantile sexuality, the dream symbolism, and the decisive causal role which sexual factors, in the broad analytic sense of the. term, play in the etiology of the psychoneuroses, in the formation of the normal personality, and in, such group phenomena as the arts and folk- ways. These are, in a loose way of speaking, facts which</page><page sequence="7">128 GUSTAV BERGMANN: nowadays baffle only the old ladies, the literati, and the Gesalters among the scientists. As far as theory is concerned, however, I find nothing except one rather sketchy law which could be formulated in this way: An individual's personality mechanisms, that is, certain not too well-defined general response patterns, have something to do with his experiences and behaviour in certain crucial periods and/or with respect to certain crucial situations. Far be it from me to belittle the achievement which is represented even by this hypothesis and whatever elaboration it has been given, for it is probably, the only step which has so far been made beyond the mere correlation of traits in this very difficult field of personality. But on the other hand, it seems absurd to consider such an ingenious vision, almost entirely devoid of any articulate causal determination, as the ultimate achievement, to be scholastically elaborated, not as just one of the starting-points of a theory of personality to be developed. I shall not take the time to say more than a few words about the last of the three background factors, those speculative tiends for which Schopenhauer and Nietzsche were chosen as significant representatives. These influences are most clearly noticeable in writings such as Freud's " Beyond the Pleasure Principle" and the theorizing or, as I should prefer to call it, the speculations about the so-called death instinct. As far as I can see, there is hardly any empirical content in this type of psychoanalytical literature and it takes much broad-mindedness and goodwill even to interpret these utterances as confused suggestions for alternative formulations of whatever theory there is. Here, I believe, the psychoanalysts have become the victims of their own metaphors and what lives on in the empty verbal shell is the ghost of a certain type of German metaphysics. It is fair to say, though, that Freud in his autobiography disavows any such influences. But does not psychoanalysis itself insist that what a man or a group recognizes as the motive or goal of his behaviour does not necessarily coincide with what the behaviour scientist calls its cause ? Here again, by the way, we make use of an insight which was genuinely revolutionary at the time of Freud and Pareto and which is just common sense and almost commonplace in contemporary behaviour science. II. After this general stage-setting, I shall devote the rest of the paper to the elaboration of a thesis which has already been indicated. This, approximately, is what it says: The basic ideas and the systematic structure of psychoanalysis and of</page><page sequence="8">PSYCHOANALYSIS AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY. 129 contemporary experimental psychology are not, as it sometimes appears, in conflict with each other. Quite to the contrary, it is more accurate to say that these two approaches are, in their basic featutes, almost identical and, in a certain sense, namely with respect to the phenomena they study, complementary. Obviously, the one and only field which psychoanalysis is interested in is that which, in more academic terms, would be called personality. Experimental psychology, on the other hand, at least that part of it which is theoretically most siguifi- cant, can well be said to centre around the so-called laws of leatning. What is thus rationalized into a pseudo-opposition turns out, as it so often happens, to be a mere difference of interest. In the case of psychoanalysis versus experimental psychology, this apparent opposition is re-enforced, not only by certain' institutional factors, but also by the circumstance that the field of personality research' is not yet, and possibly never will be, amenable to the exact laboratory methods in which the experimentalists very justifiably set their greatest pride. But I see by now that the last few sentences, in order not to be misunderstood, require a good deal of explaining. ' So let us start on a new string of explanations and qualifications. The statement that the psychology of learning is theoretically the most, significant experimental field must not be taken as a disparagement of the work done in physiological psychology and in perception psychology in particular. What it asserts is only- that perception psychology, if divorced from physiological psychology, is hardly of any theoretical interest at all, and that the reductive research of physiological psychology is, as yet, of little help in the study of molar behaviour. 'Reduction', in this context, refers to an explanation of molar behaviour by physiology; 'molar', as here used, covers a range wide enough to comprehend both the behaviour of the w*hite rat in the learning maze and the symptoms of the psychoneurotic. Presently we shall see that within.the behaviour field which, as a whole, is molar from the reductionist's point of view, the two phenomena just mentioned, animal maze learning and personality formation, lie far enough apart and are probably so related that they again can be opposed to each other as molecular (or microscopic) and molar (or macroscopic) respec- tively. These remarks should also elucidate our usage of the expression 'behaviour science'. It excludes, quite arbitrarily and for iherely practical reasons, physiology and all kinds of reductive research. A similarly qualifying remark. is needed to explain the 9</page><page sequence="9">130 GUSTAV BERGMANN: attribution of the personality field to psychoanalysis or, more correctly speaking, to clinical psychology of the p'sychiatric type. Again this involves no disparagement of the careful work, usually classified as experimental, which has been done in such fields as intelligence and the correlation of personality traits, normal or abnormal, with each other and with'environ-' mental variables. The point is rather, first, that some of this work, valuable as it is as a collection of data, as a statistical stabilization and often as a wholesome correction of our pre- scientific insights, does not hold the promise of theoretical significance' second, that nowhere in this field has the necessity of a comprehensive theory, of, a causal mechanism, been as clearly recognized as in psychoanalysis. It becomes necessary here to make a qualification within a qualification to,the effect that so far this relative excellence of psychoanalytic theorizing has expressed itself not so much in the level of achievement, or in the stringency of verification, but only in the underlying assumptions and in the systematic co'nceptions of the analytic approach. As to actual, reliable achievement experimental psychology seems far more advanced. On the other hand, it is fair to recognize, that the tremendous difficulty of the task, which psychoanalysis set out to accomplish, has at least some- thing to do with this undeniable difference. Even after these qualifications have been made, the repeated use of the expression ' significance ' calls for justification, for the term is evaluative, at least in the sense that it involves an appraisal as to the future coursef of science. ' Significant' has been used synonymously with instrumental for the construction of a factually adequate, genuinely causal theory. Such signifi- cance must not be confused with immediate social or therapeutic significance, though on the other hand we have of course good teason to believe that every theoretical progress will ultimately redound into increased social and therapeutic control. Any discrepancy between clinical and theoretical psychology which is construed by means of the ambiguity inherent in the term ' significance' is only a rationalized and often emotionalized difference of emphasis and interest. Clearly the outcome of a maze learning experiment is completely devoid of any significance in the latter, non-theoretical sense., On the other hand, it is at least conceivable that carefully worked out relationshijs between intelligence scores and environmental factors, in spite of their overwhelming social import, are not very' interesting to the theorist. To explain this: it is at least conceivable that, within the systematic framework of a fully developed science</page><page sequence="10">PSYCHOANALYSIS AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY. 131 of psychology, those intelligence correlations will find their place as rather remote and complex corollaries of basic laws which have first been abstracted from the just mentioned rat experi- ments, while, on the other hand, the intelligence correlations themselves will not have yielded any such " theoretically signifi- cant" suggestions. Whatever bias was contained in the earlier formulation can now at least be very succinctly formulated: what has just been called a conceivable course of science is the course that science is most likely to take. This bias is ap- parently shared by the majority of the experimentalists, and, again, they find themselves in substantial agreement with the empirical core of psychoanalysis. To put the whole issue into a nutshell: The central idea of the psychoanalytic theory can very well be stated as an application of the laws of learning to the field of personality. To the elucidations and qualifications which such an aperqu requires we must now turn our attention. A quick glance at physics will yield interesting cues concerning the way in which both the psychology of learning and modern empiricism formulate the task of behaviour science. Physics has now in all its branches reached the level of achievement first exemplified by Newton's theory of planetary motion. In this case, if the relative positions, velocities, and masses of the member planets at any moment are known to the physicist, he can, by application of his laws, compute or, as we also say, predict the positions and velocities at any earlier or later time point; he controls the process. The extent to which con- temporary behaviour science falls short of this ideal is best elucidated in the following manner: First, we do not possess as yet such process laws of a closed system comprehending the organism and its environment; we must concentrate upon the organism as a system which interacts with its environment. The ingoing ones of these effects, issuing from the objective physical environment, are called stimuli, the outgoing ones responses. Second, because of this lack of functional equations describing the temporal unfolding of a closed system, we must rely upon the more primitive analysis in terms of cause and effect: In order to obtain lawfulness, we must watch for the regularities which exhibit themselves in the succession of isolated temporal cross-sections of the behaviour stream. Any such cross-section could also be referred to as a state of the organism, and each such state is at least partially characterized by its stimulus and/or response aspects. The qualification ' at least partially' is of the essence of the argument, for, if we restrict our attention to the stimulus and response aspects of, for</page><page sequence="11">132 GUJSTAV BERGMANN: instance, two successive temporal cross-sections or states, attempts to find lawful connections will fail. To put the same thing positively: As is well known, most of the responses we are interested in depend not only upon the features of the objective environment to which they are made, but also upon the organism's training and its drive state. The neglect of these additional variables undoubtedly vitiates a certain kind of early psychological theory known as associationism. Again a word of warning is needed. The word 'associationism' is now also used to refer to the stimulus-response technique of defining the variables of the problem. Clearly such a technique is not a theory, but rather, as we have seen, the methodologically correct way of formulating what all experimentalists and clinicians, no matter whether or not they call themselves S-R theorists, do. Attempts to discredit this technique by an emotive use of the ambiguous term 'associationism' or, still more colourfully, 'mechanistic and elementaristic association- ism' clearly stem from and appeal to anti-naturalistic residues. Again psychoanalysis and experimental psychology are on the same side of the fence. In itself, referenlce to the two variable groups just mentioned as the organism's knowledge, perceptual or otherwise, and as its desires, conscious or unconscious, is of course not objectionable; objectionable is only the methodolo- gical confusion which slips in under the cover of the intro- spectionistic terms. The main offenders in this respect are not, as their fanciful terminology might lead one to expect, the psychoanalysts, but, because of their grounding in in- tuitionistic metaphysics, the Gestalters. What, on the other hand, keeps the experimentalists and the clinicians from com- mitting the anthropomorphic fallacy is not so much an explicit epistemology, but rather their respective Watsonian and Darwinian backgrounds. The starting-point of the confusion is this: Different organisms, or, for that matter, one and the same organism at different points in his life-history, respond differently to one and the same physical environment. Hience, so the argument runs, the psychological environments,, not to be confused with the physical ones, were different in each case and upon them the psychologist is therefore bound to concentrate his attention. Be it granted that the psychological environments were differe&amp;nt; be it also granted that in the case of an articulate subject we, could find out some times some things about his psychological environment if we could interview him before he acts. It will be noted that the point against which I am arguing has just been stretched to the utmost, for, strictly</page><page sequence="12">PSYCHOANALYSIS AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY. 133 speaking, the verbal report mentioned belongs to the overt behaviour to be predicted. But even so, what is the predictive value of the suggestive metaphor ' psychological environment' ? Is it not the business of science to ascertain which objectivs factors in the past and present states of the organism and of ite environment account for the difference in response, so that we can actually predict it instead of attributing it, merely de- scriptively and after it has happened, to a difference in the psychological environment ? As in the case of teleological thinking, the animistic metaphor is mistaken for the answer to the question which it puts. It should not be necessary, though it might-be wise, to stress at this point that the metho- dologically correct use of verbal reports, as data, and of intro- spectionistic terms, in the scientisf's account of them, is not impugned. Even as much as to expect that they could be dis- pensed with in the field of human personality is mere utopia to-day, though a utopia whose met6odiogical possibility can help us to clarify our.ideas. One should realize that the denial of this possibility leads ultimately- either to dualism or to Aristotelianism, possibly in' one of its modernized emergentist forms. The particular problems- connected with man's con- sciousness or, what for all scientific purposes amounts to the same, his symbolic responses, will be treated later. First, some remarks to complete this sketch1 of the experimentalist's schema are in order. In the field of animal behaviour, where, for the obvious reason of relative simplicity, the greatest advances have been madie in recent years, very successful definitions of the non-environ- mental variables have been achieved in such terms as fopd, water, sex deprivation periods, and number and temporal spacing of trials. Certain objective phases of the so-called consummatory or goal states, such as eating or the cessation of a nocuotis stimulus, also play an important part. Re-enforcement theorists believe that these latter states are even indispensable if learning is to take place. This is not the place to formulate, by means of these terms, the most recent hypotheses as to the laws of learning, but two of the most important aspects of this body of interrelated hypotheses shall at least be mentioned. They are the well-known principles of conditioning and of generalization. The first states that under certain conditions, most important among which is probably temporal contiguity, a stimulus situation comes to arouse a part of a response not appropriate to itself but only to the succeeding goal situation. Pavlov's salivating dogs come here readily to mind. Significant is, furthermore,</page><page sequence="13">134 GUSTAV BERGMANN: the fact that, according to present conceptions, states of the organism such as these anticipatory salivations fulfil a steering and organizing function in that chaining of responses of which all learning consists. The principle of generalization states, roughly speaking, that of two objectively similar stimulus situations each will, to a degree depending upon the degree of their similarity, elicit the response originally acquired toward the other. It is also noteworthy that the laws of learning are historical, laws in the sense that at the present state of knowledge one cannot, as in the Newtonian case, predict the future course of events from any amount of data collected at the time point where the process to be predicted starts, but that one is forced to utilize additional information concerning the past life-history of the organism. It will help to throw light on this point as well as upon some earlier remarks if one points out that only with the actual achievement of the physiological reduction are historical laws likely to disappear from the theoretical core of the behaviour sciences. This also shows that the methodological distinction between historical and non-historical or systematic laws, important as it is, is not a distinction of principle in the sense that the occurrence of historical laws constitutes an a-priori characteristic of certain subject matters. But it seems undeniable that their essentially historical character is one of the most significant features psychoanalysis and present-day psychology of learning have in common. A last remark should further elucidate the point and forestall certain objections. If a rat enters the maze with a number of marks on his back which have been made there as a record of the numbers of trials through which he has been put, the present reading of these marks still amounts to the utilizing of historical information. Likewise, if the psychoanalytic patient now recalls and reports certain events of his life-history, he too, conveys historical information, though this fact is somewhat obscured by the additional circumstance that his recalling and telling it now is :not so external to the ongoing process as the application and the reading of the colour -marks in the case of the rat. All one has to do to justify this analysis is to point at the significance, both therapeutic and theoretical, which psychoanalysts attribute to the emergence of the actual historical truth, during the course of a cure. In the last sentence the term ' historical ' has been used in its customary connotation, not with the specific meaning in which it occurs in the rest of this paragraph.</page><page sequence="14">PSYCHOANALYSIS AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCEOLOGY. .135 III. At this point of the discussion it should be obvious that I have not dodged my promise to talk about psychoanalysis and, under the sway of my behaviouristic prejudices, extolled the virtues of the white rat instead. As far jas it is possible in such a brief, survey, I even believe I have&amp;proved my point that the same basic ideas and the same frame of reference underlie both psychoanalysis and the experimental psychology of learning. In the phenomena of conditioning, for instance, and in the learning of more complex appetitive or escape (avoidance) behaviour with respect to beneficial or nocuous stimuli one recog- nizes the mechanisms to which psychoanalysts refer as, the pleasure and the reality principle. Likewise, all those kinds of behaviour which, in a different terminology, are referred to as anxiety are based upon the general anticipatory responses to nocuous stim4lations. Mechanisms like that of generaliza- tion contain at least the possibility of producing such personality mechanisms as displacement and projection. It will be noticed that the term 'mechanism' is here used in a rather vague and indiscriminate manner. The elimination of this' ambiguity will be one of our last points. Let us first notice that already that halo of vagueness which surrounds such terms as ' drive ', ' instinct ', and ' libido ' in the psychoanalytic literature has disappeared. What remains is this: Which consummatory states represent satisfiers or soothers for which hunger states belongs, within. the limits of a non-physiological behaviour science, to the basic laws which must be experimentally ascer- tained. This is one of the three points at which psychology is supported by its so-called biological basis ; all the rest is learning and therefore, though in a historical mannar, environ- mental. Clearly, the term 'instinct' has no place in such a structure; If at all, experiimentalists use it only to refer to certain very elementary unlearned stimulus-response cdn- nections like the lid reflex or the patellar response. These instincts or reflexes are the second point of contact where behaviour science, factually though not methodologically, rests upon its biological understructure. For, though this elementary outfit is aecisive for the fate of the organism, it is evident that it constitutes the kind of material whichl psychology treats as data (basic laws). It provides the basis upon which psychology erects its explanatory structure. The explanation of this basis devolves, in turn, upon the biological sciences in the narrower sense of the term. The third point of contact is provided by</page><page sequence="15">136 GUSTAV BERGMANN: those individual constants, hereditary and/or constitutional, which make for individual diference5 not reducible to environ- mental factors. Incidentally, the last few remarks indicate, in a rough manner, what there is left of a hierarchical structure within the methojologically unified system of the.sciences. Lest the last Paragraph be mrisunderstood as too sweeping an attack on the so-called libido theory, let me attempt a crude but piain formulati^on of what appears to be the empirical core of this part of the psychoanalytic theory. It 'will turn out to be the so-called theory of psychosexual personality develop- ment. The idea is that there are several pairs of hunger and goal states, corresponding to each other like thirst and drinking, which hav;e the following properties: (1) the intensity of these hunger states varies; according to some biologically given maturation curves, during'the organism's life span; (2) these hungers are so intetrelated that, under ce;tain conditions, goal states corresponding to one of them reduce the others (sub- stitution)'; (3) all the hungers of this group and only these hungers, unlike sleep, food, water hunger, etc., are highly plastie; in the sense that by some kind of generalization-like mechanism, they can be brought to accept secondary satisfiers (sublimation). The-possibility of sublimation clearly depends upon culture or, to say the same thing differently, upon the possibility' of the symbolic response. By mentioning it we have therefore reached the stage where language and, with it, consciousness have to be, taken, into account. From this point on, little concrete informa- tion can be expected from the contemporary psychology of learn- ing; at this juncture psychoanalysis takes over. This is, we recall, the respect in which psychoanalysis and the psychology of learning have been called complementary to each other. The situation is, however, not so simple as that, for in making ,this step we undoubtedly cross, in a certain sense, the border- line of reliable knowledge and shall have to be content with an as yet much lesser degree of articulateness and precision. Such a state of relative scientific ignorance is typically the one in which the philosophical methodologist can be of some modest use; for the philosopher with his prevailing interest in broad outlines will be naturally most eager to stress the discoverable structural identities and continuities. In the case at hand'he will, of course, stress the stimulus-respoiise view of language. In doing so he draws, historically speaking, upon the ingenious anticipatory vision first developed by G. H. Mead and that brand of social behaviourism that originates with him. Prag- mati&amp;m, particularly'as represented by Mead and Peirce, is,</page><page sequence="16">PSYCHOANALYSIS AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY. 137 on the other hand, also one of the historical roots of Scientific Empiricism. To observe such interrelations between the new philosophy and the new anthropology, in Kant's broad sense of the latter term, is certainly significant to the historian of ideas and, to the student of either field, very encouraging. The verbal symbol, vocal or subvocal, and/or the mental image is, according to this view, a particular kind of intermediate response. That means that it originally occurs in a relatively long chain of stimuli and responses which begins, in presence of a primary hunger, with the external stimulus and ends with an overt response. Thus it lies, even in its most complex form, on a continuum with the anticipatory salivation of Pavlov's dogs. The difference in complexity, however, is no doubt tremendous and has many aspects. First, these symbolic states or symbols, as we shall shortly call them, seem to be particularly apt to establish horizontal connections between widely different stimulus-response chains. What this pictorial expression tries to convey is this: Imagine, vertically diagrammed, two different stimulus-response chains already established. Assume that the one leads ultimately to an overt appetitive act, the other to an overt avoidance response; assume, furthermore, that one and the same symbol or similar symbols (generalization!) occur in both chains. This is sometimes sufficient to extinguish or, as one also says, to inhibit the appetitive response. Under different conditions the appetitive chain will at least be modified by elements of the avoidance chain under consideration. The " many track " variability of such processes is further increased by the apparent ease of the mechanisms which establish associ- ative connections of all kinds between the symbols. Second, to mention only one more feature, the external presentation of the symbolic stimulus alone, through speech or other symbolic devices, becomes very often sufficient to start in the organism one of those sequences of responses which follow it in one of the chains belonging to the habit pattern the individual has already acquired. The stimulus aspect of such an occurrence is just another complex case of learning; as to its motivational aspects, one can at least imagine that the cross connections just mentioned make it relatively easy to tap at least one of the just active hungers. Thus a new connection might become established and leave its trace upon the habit pattern or personality of the subject. At this point another feature should at least be mentioned which, according to Mead, operates m the communicative, culture-forming function of language. The war cry of the attacking animal " means " to him attack, while</page><page sequence="17">138 GUSTAV BERGMANN: to his victim it " means " flight. Less metaphorically expressed, the response chains called out in both organisms are different. A symbol, however, if occurring with and verbalized or other- wise expressed by a member of a cultural community, is apt to start what one might call, with considerable looseness, the same response chain in any of his fellows. The limits of this sameness coincide roughly with what in other contexts is referred to as the emotive limitations of communication. Clearly, these few remarks are but a philosopher's map of scientific No Man's Land; even to consider them as the sketch of a learning theory of personality and of the higher processes would be inexcusable wishful thinking. But they can serve as an expository device and furnish the background for further elucidation of the relationship between the two approaches, psychoanalysis and the experimental psychology of learning. If there is any anticipatory truth at all in this speculative map, then the relationship in question is that between two corre- sponding molar and molecular levels, as these terms have been used in an earlier paragraph of this paper. It is convenient to begin with a clarification of the term 'mechanism'. So far it has been used ambiguously to denote, on the one hand, regular stimulus response sequences, both innate (reflexes) and acquired, and, on the other hand, the laws of learning which regulate their acquisition. This ambiguity is harmless; to point it out is sufficient to avoid confusion. More pertinent to our purpose is the fact that psychoanalysts and experimentalists if they both speak about mechanisms, speak about lawfulness on two different levels. Again an analogy from physics should help. At a certain stage in the kinetic theory of matter thermodynamic laws, like the formula of Boyle and Charles, are considered as conse- quences of the laws of Newtonian mechanics which operate, behind the surface, between the numerous particles of the substance. Certain statistical assumptions provide the very elaborate deductive connection between this micromechanism of Newtonian mechanics and the macromechanism of the gas laws. The illustration is meant to clarify the meaning of our terms. The point to be made can be stated in the following manner: The experimental psychology of learning studies the micromechanisms of which the so-called personality mechanisms of psychoanalysis are the very complex macro-result. The mediating theory, comparable to the statistical assumptions and their elaboration by Maxwell and Boltzmann, is so far missing. This decisive fact should not become obliterated by certain -similarities between the respective mechanisms which</page><page sequence="18">PSYCHOANALYSIS AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY. 139 find their verbal expression in the use of such terms as ' inhibi- tion ' in both fields. Possibly these similarities are all very superficial; possibly, but not probably or improbably, for not even a hypothesis can be offered at the present stage of- our knowledge. If one were in a position to do that or if this reduc- tion were actually achieved, psychoanalysts, when asked for the explanation of a personality trait would not, instead of an answer, give that endless enumeration of possibilities which is so exasperating to the scientific mind. This shows that the methodological unification here attempted does not invite any rash optimism. Quite to the contrary, while it helps to eliminate pseudo-arguments, it also brings to the fore the difficulty of the task ahead. The main root of this difficulty lies, no doubt, in the tremendous complexity of the symbolic apparatus which mediates between man's prime motivators and his overt responses. Let us, in conclusion, test the plausibility of this schema by inquiring what light it sheds upon the metaphorical terminology of the psychoanalysts. Within the limits of a broad, structural allocation one finds the Id rather satisfactorily represented by the prime motivators and those response habits which have been partially extinguished by the learning process. Ego and Superego are somewhat cruder conceptions. What they repre- sent, personalized and endowed with some driving power of its own, is apparently the difference between the total pattern of the responses as they would occur before, and as they actually do occur after, the development of the symbolic apparatus during the learning process. Conscious are, by definition, those intermediate states of the organism which contaiui the actual occurrence of a verbal symbol and/or image. 'Intermediate' is always understood as referring to a response which stands, in an acquired chain, somewhere between the external stimulus and the overt response. The additional complication that vocalized verbal responses acquire cultilrally the value of overt non-verbal responses is here neglected. But even so it seems plausible that the symbolic responses are located relatively near the end of their chains and that the reaction is therefore less easily stopped short of overt expression if the process has once reached the conscious stage. Repression, that is the stopping of an initiated response sequence before it reaches that stage, becomes thus plausible as the result of association with strongly negative states; it also becomes plausible that anxiety, the general anticipatory response to such states, is aroused whenever strongly inhibited response sequences are about to reach con- sciousness. It is significant in this context and has been pointed</page><page sequence="19">140 GUSTAV BERGMANN: EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY. out by C. L. Hull that the first training of the libidinal hungers takes place,in that period of life-history where the child's symbolic apparatus is still entirely missing or relatively rudi- mentary. So it seems indeed that we acquire much of our personality traits, like the rat its maze habits, through un- conscious learning. SELECTED REFERENCES.
