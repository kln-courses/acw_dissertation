Joyce and Marcus Winter This article adopts an actor-based theoretical approach to the ori- gins and evolution of urban society in highland Oaxaca from 500 B.C. to A.D. 8oo, arguing that the development of urban societies was driven by the behavioral strategies of individuals rather than by cultural or ecological systems. Settlement patterns, mortuary practices, architecture, ceramics, writing, calendrics, and iconog- raphy are used to trace changes in behavioral strategies during the urban period in pre-Hispanic Oaxaca beginning with the founding of the political center of Monte Alban. Elite manipula- tion of ideology is identified as a key factor in the development of urban society in Oaxaca. This ideological change involved the increasing control of ritual knowledge and authority by the elite, the promotion of external conflict, and the development of an elite social identity. ARTHUR A. JOYCE is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Van- derbilt University (Nashville, Tenn. 37235, U.S.A.).

Archaeological research in highland Oaxaca (fig. i) has traced the origins, development, and collapse of urban societies from 500 B.C. to A.D. 8oo (Blanton I978, Flan- nery and Marcus i 983 a, Kowalewski et al. I989, Winter i989a). Explanations for the origins and development of urban societies in highland Oaxaca and elsewhere in Mesoamerica have been largely derived from cultural ecology (Sanders and Nichols I988, Sanders and Price i968) and ecological systems theory (Flannery I972, Spencer i982, Wright I977). These approaches share a materialist perspective which assumes that human groups (variously modeled as societies, cultures, or pop- ulations) are the units that drive social developments such as urbanization and state formation (Orlove i980). They rely on an organismic analogy that likens the soci- ety, culture, or ecosystem to a functioning organism. As useful as cultural ecology and systems theory have been for modeling social evolution, they have been criticized on a variety of theoretical and empirical grounds by biol- ogists, ecologists, and anthropologists (Athens I977, Co- linvaux I973, Hodder i982b, Peoples i982, Slobodkin I972, Vayda and McCay I975). These critics have shown that cultural ecologists and systems theorists have been unable to demonstrate that discrete systems actually oc- cur at the level of populations, cultures, and ecosystems. In addition, a focus on population-level systems ignores the goal-driven behavior of social actors and intrasocie- tal (class, ethnic, racial) conflict among those actors (Brumfiel I992, Cowgill I993, Hodder i982b). In this article we examine the origins, development, and collapse of urban states in highland Oaxaca from an actor-based perspective that avoids attributing systemic properties to social groups (Joyce I99I, I994a, b). In par- ticular, we consider how ideology was used to initiate many of the sociocultural changes involved in the devel- opment of urban societies. We view people as dynamic actors in a social process rather than as components of a system or passive responders to the environment. We assume that it is the behavior of individuals rather than the functioning of social or ecological systems that causes changes in the properties of social groups. Theoretical Perspective Our theoretical perspective follows other actor-based ap- proaches by examining individual-level behavioral strat- egies in relation to the biophysical and sociocultural en- vironment (Giddens I984, Mithen 1990, Orlove 1980, Vayda i986). People pursue particular behavioral strate- gies to acquire and use resources, including information, for themselves and their close kin in competition with i. We thank Wendy Ashmore, Henri J. M.

The behav- ioral strategies of individuals and their relative success in controlling resources are operationalized here using the concept of social identity. Social identities consist of two types of variables (McGuire i983): social roles and social statuses (Joyce I99I:269-8I, 602-707). Social roles specify strategies used by people to control, ac- quire, store, and use resources; they include behaviors defined by factors such as gender, occupation, kinship, ethnicity, and religion. Social status is a measure of an individual's ability to control material resources and in- formation relative to other members of society. Social roles and statuses may covary, as when occupation or lineage define status, or they may be independent of one another (McGuire i983). Social status as defined here reflects two usually re- lated factors: power and wealth. Power is the ability to control resources, including other people and informa- tion, and is often a product of and a means to obtain wealth. Power depends on the capabilities of strategizing actors as well as on the properties of the biophysical and sociocultural environment, which create asymmetries among actors in resources available to be mobilized (see Giddens i984:i5-i6). Wealth is a measure of the rela- tive amount of resources that a person has accumulated. Status differences may be continuous within a society, or there may be distinct breaks in status creating clearly defined social classes. While power and wealth usually covary, they can also be decoupled, as when religious practitioners are restricted from using their power for the accumulation of personal wealth. For purposes of this article, however, power and wealth are assumed to covary with status. It is possible to infer social identities because their effects are archaeologically visible, especially the effects of identities adopted by many people (e.g., low-status farmers) or those of a few people who had a great impact on society (e.g., rulers). While archaeological data do not allow the delineation of all the social identities of the past, they do permit access to the more visible, institu- tionalized, and widely shared ones, such as occupations, ethnic affiliations, and statuses (Schortman i989).</page><page sequence="3">BLANTON ET AL. Agency, Ideology, and Power | 35 Variation in social identities also provides a means for identifying social complexity through estimates of heterogeneity and inequality (Blau I977, McGuire I983). Societies become more complex with increases in heter- ogeneity and inequality, which measure variability in the social identities of group members. Heterogeneity is a measure of the frequency of distinct social roles and status levels in a society. The development of craft and other types of economic specialization and the differen- tiation of administrative roles among political elites are examples of increases in heterogeneity. Inequality is a measure of status differentiation. The unequal social re- lations that largely define complex societies such as states2 must be understood in terms of the flow of re- sources among individuals channeled by power differen- tials. In nonindustrial societies, such as those in pre- Hispanic Mesoamerica, wealth above a relatively low level must be accumulated as a result of the labor of other people. Therefore, inequality in these societies largely involves the ability of some members to create, legitimate, and institutionalize a positive net flow of resources from others. Relationships of power among in- dividuals are created and legitimated by the material benefits that they provide and/or by ideologies that make them seem beneficial and/or unalterable. Inequal- ity is generally derived from three overlapping types of power relations: reciprocity, coercion, and ideology. Power arises from reciprocity when nonelites provide material resources to elites in return for benefits in the form of information-often some type of administrative input that allows individuals to coordinate their actions more efficiently and/or more accurately predict environ- mental contingencies (e.g., drought, flood, disease). In a reciprocal relationship, the information input provided by elites results in real material benefits for nonelites. Elites gain disproportionately in material resources be- cause of the extra share they take in return for their administrative efforts. However, nonelites also gain rel- ative to their likely condition in the absence of elite administration. Coercive power involves the use of threats and force by elites to compel nonelites to cooperate and provide resources. The threat can include potential physical harm or the withholding of critical resources. Coercive power requires elite control of a desired resource and/or some type of coercive apparatus such as a police force. Ideological power depends on the concealment of the interests of the elites by representing those interests as universal, by denying intrasocietal conflicts of interest, and by naturalizing the present to preserve the elites' dominant position (Giddens I979:I93-97). Ideology of- ten conceals elite interests by creating the belief that nonelites are engaged in a reciprocal relationship with elites despite their net loss of resources. Nonelites may, in effect, be deceived into supporting the elites even if neither group is fully conscious of the deception (Gode- lier I978). Ideologies often promote abstract symbols of authority such as deities, flags, and patriotism that cloud the relationship between elite interests and political de- cision making (Cohen I98I, Edelman I964, Mack I983). The psychology of dominance/deference relations may reinforce ideological power, since people seem to be prone to relinquish power and autonomy to authority figures, especially during times of crisis (Caspary I993, Milgram I974, Volkan I985). In addition, it is difficult to separate a dominant ideology that masks inequality from an ethos that explains many elements of existence for people at all status levels (Giddens I979:I84-96). However, to the extent that people are able to penetrate a dominant ideology, elite power will fail unless sup- ported by coercion or reciprocity. The theoretical perspective outlined here views peo- ple as dynamic actors in a social process. Population- level phenomena such as social organization and subsis- tence patterns are viewed as the outcome of behavioral strategies which are both enabled and constrained by the biophysical and sociocultural environment (Giddens I984). Tracking changes in behavioral strategies through time will allow the evaluation of hypotheses conceming the conditions that led to these changes. As people de- velop novel behavioral strategies, these strategies and their material and ideological correlates in tum become part of subsequent environments. While we share a number of concems with many post- processual archaeologists, we hesitate to label ourselves as such because of the diversity of positions subsumed under that label (see Hodder I99I, Preucel I99I). Our actor-based perspective, like much of postprocessual ar- chaeology (Hodder i982b, I99I; Shanks and Tilley I988; I992:52-5 3; Tilley i982), has emerged from a critique of the functionalist focus of processual archaeology (Joyce I99I). Ideology, power, and social agency are themes that are also shared by postprocessual and marxist ar- chaeologists (Hodder i98.2a, I99I; McGuire i992; Miller I985; Miller and Tilley I984; Shanks and Tilley i992; Spriggs I984) and increasingly by neopositivist/ processual archaeologists (Demarest and Conrad i9992; Earle and Preucel I987:5I0-I3; Spencer I993). We agree with Hodder (I987, I99I), however, that it is crucial to understand the two-way relationship between agency and structure and to examine how "rationality" may be affected by social and cultural conditions. Monte Alban and the Origins of Urban Society The urban period in Oaxaca began about 500 B.C. with the founding of the hilltop center of Monte Alban in the Valley of Oaxaca. Survey data suggest that soon after its founding Monte Alban was the largest community in 2. From this perspective, the state can be defined as a polity with heterogeneity in the administrative roles of political elites (i.e., specialized decision making or govemment) as well as great in- equality implying social stratification and political centralization (Wright 1977:385). In addition, the power of political elites is usu- ally manifest in their ability to draft soldiers, levy taxes, and exact tribute (Flannery 1972:404). Taxes and tribute are used in part to construct and/or maintain public buildings, works, and services, including the institutions and personnel of a state religion.</page><page sequence="4">36 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 37, Number i, February I996 the valley (Kowalewski et al. i989) with settlement reaching 442 ha by IOO B.C. and an estimated population of io,200-20,400 (Blanton I978:44). Even during its first few centuries Monte Albain's political and ritual impor- tance was reflected in its monumental architecture, high-status burials, and carved stone monuments, in- cluding some of the earliest examples of hieroglyphic writing known for Mesoamerica. The site may have been a market center, and it seems to have been a point for the concentration and redistribution of imported goods such as pottery, obsidian, shell, and greenstone (Winter I984, I989a). Overall, the evidence suggests that shortly after its founding the size and complexity of Monte Albain would have made it an urban center. THE ORIGINS OF URBAN SOCIETY IN OAXACA The origins and early development of Monte Albain oc- curred during the Late Formative period,3 which lasted from 500 B.C. to A.D. 200 and included Periods Ia (500- 300 B.C.), Ic (300-IOO B.C.), and II (IOO B.C.-A.D. 200) of the Valley of Oaxaca ceramic sequence (Caso, Bemal, and Acosta i967). Social complexity increased consider- ably during the Late Formative. Increasing heterogeneity is suggested by evidence for the emergence of a variety of craft specialist roles among nonelites, while elites ap- pear to have taken on the role of ritual specialists. In- creasing inequality is reflected by great increases in the wealth and power of elites. Many researchers argue that a state polity arose in the Valley of Oaxaca with Monte Albain as its capital (Blanton et al. I982:69-7I; Flannery and Marcus I983a; Spencer i982:I2-3i), although oth- ers debate this claim (Sanders and Nichols I988). Late Formative population growth in the Valley of Oa- xaca was tremendous, with estimates from survey data suggesting a 27-fold increase during Period I (Kowalew- ski et al. I989:9o, 123-26). Most of this growth occurred at Monte Alban and within 2o km of the urban center. The majority of new sites in this core region, including Monte Albain, were located in the piedmont. Moving from the valley floor into the piedmont would have been an energetically costly and ecologically risky strategy given the high erosion potential and relatively lower pro- ductivity of piedmont soils (Kirkby I973). Archaeological data suggest that the rising status of the elites at Monte Albain was built on tribute in the form of labor and resources provided by nonelites, espe- cially those living in the core region. These communi- ties were evidently using small-scale irrigation to gener- ate agricultural surpluses to provision the large number of people living on the infertile slopes of Monte Albain (Kowalewski et al. i989:I23-24; O'Brien et al. i982; Winter i988:82-84). Nonelites contributed corvee labor for massive building projects at Monte Albain and lesser centers in the valley such as San Jose Mogote (Acosta I965 :8I8; Flannery and Marcus I983 b). They may also have provided their services as soldiers, since the Late Formative appears to have been a period of frequent con- flict (Joyce I99I:558-67). Rising labor demands created an opportunity for some individuals and communities to specialize in the pro- duction of crafts such as pottery, chipped stone tools, salt, and lime (Feinman I986; Hewitt, Winter, and Pe- terson I987; Parry I987; Whalen I988; Winter I984: i98-200). Craft specialists probably took advantage of the fact that most people would have had less time to carry out the full array of productive tasks that they had previously undertaken. Increased labor demands may also explain the rapid growth in population. The increased labor output of nonelites primarily ben- efited a small emerging elite class increasingly removed from agricultural production. The nonagrarian role of the elites is suggested by evidence that they increasingly acted as ritual specialists, directing religious ceremon- ies, especially those in public settings (Flannery and Marcus I976a:38.2-83; I976b:2I7-I9; I983a). Elites controlled certain ritually significant forms of esoteric knowledge, including astronomy and the calendar, and were able to communicate this information via writing. Communal rituals appear to have been carried out by elites in distinct precincts characterized by monumental public buildings and elite residences as well as large pla- zas or patios such as the Main Plaza at Monte Albain (Flannery and Marcus I983 b; Whalen I98I:I04; Winter and Joyce I994). Symbols and artifacts used in ritual con- texts, including hieroglyphic writing, calendrics, ums, and incense burners, have been found almost exclusively within these precincts, often as offerings in high-status burials (Feinman I986:365; Flannery and Marcus I983c; Marcus I983 a; Winter I989 a,:48-6i). Elites probably also had key roles in directing the production of monu- mental architecture and certain prestige items. Status inequality during this period was considerably greater than before and seems to have continued to in- crease (Joyce I99I:644-48). Status distinctions are most clearly demonstrated by mortuary data (Autry I973; Drennan I976a:appendix I4; Flannery and Marcus I983C; Whalen i988:300-302). The majority of Late For- mative burials were interred in simple graves that either lacked offerings or included from one to three ceramic vessels and at times other items such as obsidian blades and shell artifacts. A smaller number of high-status burials were often in formal tombs with abundant offer- ings of items such as ceramic vessels, jade, shell, and obsidian. In addition to the mortuary data there is evi- dence from the sites of Monte Albain, Barrio del Rosario Huitzo, Tomaltepec, San Agustin de las Juntas, and San Jose Mogote that elites may have lived in larger and more elaborate houses (Flannery and Marcus I983b; Whalen I98I:85-86; Winter I986:342; Winter and Joyce I994). IDEOLOGY AND THE GROWTH OF URBAN SOCIETY The behavioral strategies of elites during the Late For- mative were successful in mobilizing resources. The key 3. The Late Formative is often divided into Late ( 00-100 B.C.) and Terminal (IOO B.C.-A.D. 200). For convenience we refer to the en- tire period as the Late Formative.</page><page sequence="5">BLANTON ET AL. Agency, Ideology, and Power | 37 theoretical problem, however, is to explain why non- elites moved to denser communities and increasingly supported an emerging elite class when both behaviors were often materially detrimental. Given the proposi- tions outlined earlier, we expect that they must have been compelled to support the elite through reciprocity, coercion, and/or ideology. We find little evidence that it was reciprocity or coer- cion that induced the Late Formative changes in power relations (Joyce I99I:650-54). There is no evidence for economic stress (e.g., population pressure) that might have provided an opportunity for the elite reciprocally to manage agricultural production, storage, or distribution (Nicholas I989:49I-94). Large-scale irrigation or market systems requiring elite administration do not appear to have been present prior to the founding of Monte Albain (Winter I984, I988). It is also unlikely that coercion was the primary source of elite power; this would have re- quired a large, well-organized army that was probably beyond the capacity of Rosario-phase (700-500 B.C.) or Period Ia polities. In addition, there is no evidence for forced resettlement or for widespread conflict before the Late Formative. Instead of reciprocity or coercion, we argue, elite power during the Late Formative resulted primarily from an ideological transformation, probably initiated by the elites, that resulted in their becoming ritual specialists.4 The ritual role of elites gave them more ability to influ- ence the workings of the natural and supernatural world and to intercede on the behalf of nonelites (Demarest i992, Grove and Gillespie i99.2a, Masson, Orr, and Ur- cid i992, Monaghan I994, Schele and Freidel I990, Spores i983a). Elites served as cosmic mediators for their followers through the performance of rituals such as bloodletting, human sacrifice, and divination. Politi- cal power and wealth resulted from ritual power; non- elites provided the elites with productive resources, such as foodstuffs and labor, often in ritualized contexts that supported the elites and their special abilities to affect the cosmos.5 Because these affairs were intimately associated with production, health, and well-being, the intervention of elites counterbalanced the loss of re- sources by nonelites and created for the latter a situation of material obligation and deference. Of course, this ide- ology was in fact deceptive, since elites had little empiri- cal control over conditions such as rainfall, drought, and disease that affected productivity and health. The ideo- logical changes of the Late Formative would have repre- sented the interests of the elites as universal, everyone being dependent on the effectiveness of their ritual. Ideological power involving ritual control has deep roots in Mesoamerican culture (Drennan I976b, I983a; Flannery and Marcus I983d:64; Grove and Gillespie i992a, b). Grove and Gillespie (i992a) argue that high status was legitimated by the ritual role of elites as far back as the Early Formative (I500-800 B.C.), although elites did not monopolize ritual authority to the extent that they would during later periods. Ideology may be fundamental to power relations in chiefdoms, since elite power appears to be dependent on public demonstrations of sanctity and sacred knowledge, especially the ritual redistribution of prestige goods (Earle i99i; Feinman 1991; Helms I979, I988; Steponaitis 1991). The existence of an ideology involving the ritual con- trol of natural and supernatural forces would explain the actions of nonelites at the beginning of Period I. The establishment of a politico-religious center at Monte Al- bain would have drawn people interested in maintaining good relations with natural and supernatural forces. The early years of Monte Albain, however, involved more than simply the migration of elites and their followers. The increasingly restricted association of ritual para- phernalia with indications of high status suggests that elites manipulated the preexisting ideology so that it was primarily they who administered religious affairs. The specialized ritual role of elites would have given them greater power to compel people to relocate and provide tribute in the form of agricultural surpluses and corvee labor. Elites therefore manipulated the cultural environment which allowed them to mobilize resources more effectively. An element of coercive power may have been involved, given that the elite controlled the acquisition of prestige goods and represented the apex of the redistributive/ritual network. The movement of elites to Monte Albain would therefore have provided an inducement for lower-level elites and their followers to relocate (see Helms I979, Millon I974, Sanders and Webster I988). Elites consolidated power by naturalizing their roles as ritual specialists, making those roles part of the sa- cred assumptions of Zapotec culture (Drennan I976b: 348). Elite power, however, may have been legitimated primarily through the sanctification of politico-religious institutions rather than of specific individuals or kin groups. There are only a few depictions of local elites on the numerous Late Formative carved stone monu- ments at Monte Albain. Instead, nearly all of the carved stones set into the foundations of public buildings depict slain or sacrificial victims and subjugated localities (Caso I938, I947; Marcus I99.2a). While elites appar- ently directed public rituals, the most visible symbols of sacred power were the monumental public buildings in which these ceremonies were produced. The Monte Albain hilltop itself may have been a sacred monument, visually and perhaps symbolically dominating the val- 4. The recovery of small numbers of ceramic figurines in low-status domestic contexts (Whalen I98I:96; Winter 1974:982) suggests, however, that nonelites continued to perform some private, house- hold rituals much as they do today throughout Mesoamerica. 5. The special abilities and status of the elites were symbolized by certain materials and ideas to which only they had access (Chase and Chase I992). For example, at the time of the Spanish conquest the Zapotec nobility was differentiated from commoners by mode of dress, diet, marriage, and speech as well as literacy and preferen- tial access to prestige goods (Marcus i992b; Spores and Flannery I983; Whitecotton 1977:142-43). These materials and ideas marked their separate social identities. At the time of the conquest, the fundamental distinction in the social identities of elites and nonelites was seen to have emanated from their separate origins and descent; it was believed that elites had descended from super- natural beings (Marcus i992a, b).</page><page sequence="6">38 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 37, Number i, February I996 ley. Throughout Mesoamerica, hilltops were often seen as sacred places, and several scholars have argued that pre-Hispanic pyramids were representations of sacred hills (Schele and Freidel I990). The focus on sacred insti- tutions could have been a way of concealing the actual locus of elite power. The founding of Monte Albain was a key event in the ideological and social changes of the Late Formative. Re- cent excavations demonstrate that Monte Alban's first few centuries witnessed the rapid construction of monu- mental architecture around the Main Plaza on a scale far larger than had been seen in the valley before (Winter and Joyce I994). It is possible that the establishment of Monte Albain was in part a strategy to free its founders from the kind of interelite competition that often cre- ates political instability in chiefdoms (Wright I977). The control of prestige goods, used to legitimate elites and to cement ties among them, appears to have been a key source of power in earlier chiefdoms (Marcus Ig8ga), Grove and Gillespie igg2a). The Main Plaza, with its impressive public buildings visible throughout much of the valley below, would have been a permanent source of prestige and sacred power that could not have been accessed by other elites except through cooperation with Monte Albain's rulers or conquest. Prestige goods contin- ued to be used to negotiate interelite relations and sym- bolize the separateness of royalty, but the ideological changes of the Late Formative may have made them less central to the legitimation of power between elites and nonelites. The sanctity of the elites was also expressed by the development of highly standardized and elaborate forms of symbolic expression, including hieroglyphic and ca- lendric inscriptions (Marcus I99g2a) and the marking of astronomical phenomena (Peeler I989), that represented a growing body of knowledge accessible only to the elite. The Late Formative marks the earliest appearance of pottery vessels with representations of Cocijo, the Zapo- tec god of lightning. Cocijo is depicted only on elaborate vessels, including urns, usually recovered from high- status burials, public buildings, or elite residences (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta I967). Ethnohistorical sources show that Cocijo was perhaps the most powerful Zapotec su- pernatural, controlling forces such as clouds, wind, and rain (Marcus I983b). Elites and especially royal ances- tors were seen as having special relationships with this deity. Therefore, literacy, calendric and astronomical knowledge, and associations with Cocijo were symbols of an emerging elite identity separate from that of non- elites. While elites apparently acted as mediators between divine forces and nonelites, their ritual and political re- sponsibilities may also have involved ensuring success against human enemies (Joyce I99I, I994b, c). Evidence of militaristic and defensive concerns is common at Monte Albain during the Late Formative. The central po- sition of Monte Albain within the valley and its eleva- tion above the valley floor made it an excellent location for both political control and defense. The construction of defensive walls around parts of the site at this time would have gone beyond their obvious utility (i.e., to keep enemies out) to serve as a form of propaganda pro- moting the external threat and enhancing messages of control and the exclusivity of the precinct. The con- struction of the Period II ball court in the Main Plaza at Monte Albain might also reflect a concern with conflict, since the pre-Hispanic ball game seems to have acted as a boundary mechanism symbolically expressing and resolving both inter- and intrasocietal conflict (Gillespie I99I, Schele and Miller I986). Themes of conflict are depicted in the approximately 36o carved stones set into monumental buildings in the Main Plaza, including the so-called danzantes and con- quest slabs (figs. 2 and 3). The Period I danzantes depict male figures in various contorted positions, sometimes with brief hieroglyphic inscriptions, and are generally viewed as representations of slain or sacrificed individu- als. The Period II conquest slabs consist of about 50 carved stones depicting places conquered by and/or pay- ing tribute to Monte Albain (Caso I938, I947; Marcus 1992 a:394-400). These carved stones could have carried a forceful message of the consequences of opposing the elites from either within or without. Conflict with polities outside the Valley of Oaxaca is supported by evidence for the conquest of the Cuicatlan Cafiada by Monte Alban (Redmond I 983, Spencer I 98.2). Other regions such as the Ejutla and Miahuatlan Valleys and mountainous areas near the Valley of Oaxaca may have been incorporated into the Monte Albain polity (Drennan I983b; Feinman and Nicholas I990:230-34; Winter I989a;63). In the Mixteca Alta and Baja as well as in the Tehuacain Valley there is evidence for an in- crease in interpolity conflict, although it is unlikely that these regions were subjugated by Monte Albin (Joyce I99I:563-67; I994C). The coordination of defensive measures may have served as a source of ideological power for the elite and an inducement for nonelites to surrender autonomy and tribute. The presence of an external threat provides elites with power through the organization of military measures including the formation of an army and the construction of defensive works.6 To the degree that the threats are real and unprovoked, the elites are acting reciprocally with nonelites for collective defense. How- ever, these conditions also make it advantageous for the elites to promote the perception of external threats through propaganda in order to extract resources from commoners. While the promotion of the threat may lead to actual conflict, the nature of elite power under these circumstances is ideological. The threat is used to repre- sent elite interests as universal and to transmute intra- societal conflicts of interest (Lane I966, Tilly I985). The promotion of external threats could also have legiti- 6. Even small-scale, ritualized warfare among elites could have posed a perceived threat if rulers were ritual specialists mediating with the cosmos on behalf of commoners. A victory would then have demonstrated the divine efficacy of the elites, while defeat would have had disastrous consequences for the entire society's relationship with the supernatural.</page><page sequence="7">BLANTON ET AL. Agency, Ideology, and Power 39 FIG. .2. Late Formative carved stones from the Main Plaza at Monte Alba'n: danzantes (left to right, DII, DI2, and D55), redraw-n from Scott (1978). mated the creation of a potentially coercive military force. Viewed in this way, the promotion of interpolity conflict in the Valley of Oaxaca would have been bene- ficial to the elites regardless of the quantity of resources obtained from conquered or intimidated regions. The two main sources of elite power, religion and war- fare, were probably part of a complex ideology. A major link between religion and warfare with deep roots in pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica was the ritual sacrifice of war captives (Boone I984, Freidel I986). If most of the danzantes represent sacrificial victims, then the sacri- fices may have taken place among the public buildings of the Main Plaza in ritual contexts. Ethnohistorical data show that war captives were sacrificed to Cocijo (Mar- cus I983b), the deity on many Period II urns. The ap- pearance of ball courts during Period II may also reflect the linkage between religion and warfare (Orr I993). In summary, a key factor in the social changes of the Late Formative in the Valley of Oaxaca was an elite strategy involving the manipulation of ideology (Joyce i99i:642-68). The ideological changes that this strategy engendered included the promotion of interpolity con- flict and the increasing control of ritual knowledge and authority by the elites. Both of these factors could have compelled nonelites to provide resources in return for the apparent protective services of the elites. The pro- motion of external threats would have allowed elites to extract resources for the organization of military mea- sures. The control of ritual knowledge and authority would have allowed the elites to provide protection from perceived natural and supernatural threats. This ideol- ogy created and legitimated the power of the elites, lead- ing directly to increasing inequality and indirectly to increasing heterogeneity, population growth, and inter- polity conflict. Ideology and Urban Society in the Mixteca Evidence from the Mixteca suggests that the develop- ment of complex urban societies occurred there during the Late Formative, probably a century or two after the founding of Monte Albain (Gaxiola I984, Spores I983a, Winter I994). In the Mixteca Alta the Late Formative includes Periods I (400-IOO B.C.) and II (IOO B.C.-A.D. 2oo) at Huamelulpan and the Ramos phase (500 B.C.-A.D. 300) in the Nochixtla'n Valley. In the Mixteca Baja it encompasses the Nudee phase (500 B.C.-A.D. 3oo). During the Late Formative urban centers arose at Yucuita, Huamelulpan, and Monte Negro in the Mix- teca Alta and at Cerro de las Minas and Diquiyui in the Mixteca Baja. These urban centers were smaller than Monte Albain, with settlement ranging from 5o to IoO ha and populations probably no greater than 3,000 (Spores I983b, Winter I994).7 They were similar to Monte Al- ban, however, in that they were nucleated centers with monumental architecture, carved stones with hiero- glyphic writing, and possibly markets. Yucuita seems to have been a center for the concentration and redistribu- tion of imported goods such as pottery, obsidian, shell, and greenstone (Winter I984). Data from the Mixteca8 7. The Late Formative and Classic centers of the Mixteca were probably at the lower end of the size range for urban sites, but their nucleation, monumental architecture, and apparent political and ritual functions have led many archaeologists to consider them urban (Flannery and Marcus I983a:83; Gaxiola I984; Joyce 1994C; Spores I983b, d; Winter I989a, i992, 1994). 8. "Mixteca" here means only the Alta and the Baja; the coastal region now known as the Mixteca de la Costa was probably not inhabited by Mixtecs until the Postclassic period (Joyce and Winter I989). In addition, despite fluctuating degrees of similarity in elite and nonelite culture during the Formative and Classic Periods, the</page><page sequence="8">40 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 37, Number i, February I996 . _C 0 FIG. 3. Late Formative glyphs from the Building J conquest slabs (top, Lapida 4; bottom, Lapida io), redrawn from Caso (I947). also suggest a variety of correspondences with the Valley of Oaxaca sequence, including increasing inequality and conflict as well as the adoption of a similar elite culture and ideology. Before about 500 B.C. inequality was limited in the Mixteca (Winter I994). During the Late Formative, how- ever, mortuary and residential data suggest a significant increase in status differences. In the Mixteca, most indi- viduals were interred in simple graves with modest of- ferings, although at Yucuita, Monte Negro, and Hua- melulpan tombs of adobe blocks, stone, or both were constructed (Acosta and Romero i992; Gaxiola i984: 60-63; Robles Garcia i988; Winter i986, iggia). There seems to have been a continuum, however, in the quan- tity and quality of offerings, even between simple graves and tombs, suggesting that elite and nonelite statuses were not as sharply segregated as in the Valley of Oa- xaca. Data on variability in the size and architectural complexity of residences more clearly suggest inequality (Ferna6ndez i98i, Robles Garcia i988, Winter i986). At Yucuita, residential units Ms and Ai are inferred to have been high-status residences on the basis of their relatively large size and number of rooms, their stuccoed floors, and their more elaborate architecture. Beneath the central patio of Ai, Ferna6ndez (I98I:53) found a tomb constructed of stone with niches and stuccoed walls. Similar elite residences have been exposed at Monte Negro and Huamelulpan (Acosta and Romero i992, Gaxiola i984), although excavations at these sites have not yet provided a comparative sample of nonelite houses. The power of the Mixtec elites is also suggested by the scale of Late Formative building activities. The mo- bilization of large labor forces would have been required to construct monumental public buildings at Yucuita, Huamelulpan, Monte Negro, and Cerro de las Minas (Acosta and Romero i992; Gaxiola i984; Winter I989a: I23; I994). In addition, some elite residences, such as Ai at Yucuita, may have been palaces, with both resi- dential and politico-religious administrative functions (Femaindez I98I; Winter I986:350). Evidence from Yu- cuita suggests that the size of elite residences increased during the Late Formative (Fernandez i98i). Heterogeneity in the Mixteca was less than in the Val- ley of Oaxaca. Presumably there would have been a small number of specialized artisans who manufactured anthropomorphic urns and carved stones. There must also have been architectural specialists who directed the construction of monumental buildings. It is uncertain whether these roles were pursued by elites themselves or by others under their supervision. Mixtec elites ap- pear to have increasingly taken on the role of ritual spe- cialists during the Late Formative (Spores I983a). Elite residences in the Mixteca Alta were generally located in distinct precincts along with public buildings. At Monte Negro, high-status houses were connected to temples by roofed corridors, and tombs were often located beneath the temple floors (Acosta and Romero i992). At Yucuita, the large public platform associated with Ai suggests that the inhabitants of this elite residence had some type of religious-administrative role (Winter I986:348-5o). Ritually significant objects and symbols such as carved stones with hieroglyphic writing and urns are found al- most exclusively in elite-administrative precincts in the Mixteca Alta (Acosta and Romero I9992; Gaxiola I984; Winter i986:346-52) and in association with monu- mental architecture of uncertain function at Cerro de las Minas in the Mixteca Baja (Winter i i b). Mixteca and the Zapotec Valley of Oaxaca appear from both archae- ological and linguistic data to have been ethnically distinct (Josser- and, Winter, and Hopkins I984, Marcus I983e, Winter I989a).</page><page sequence="9">BLANTON ET AL. Agency, Ideology, and Power I 4I Many of the ritually significant artifacts and symbols that are found associated with elites in the Mixteca ap- pear to have been adopted from the Valley of Oaxaca. While rare in the Mixteca during the Late Formative, hieroglyphic writing, including calendric notations, was executed in a style very similar to that of the Oaxaca Valley (Marcus i992a: i2o). Locally made gray ware an- thropomorphic urns at Huamelulpan and Cerro de las Minas are similar in style to those from the Valley of Oaxaca (fig. 4). Several of these urns depict variants of Dzahui, the rain-lightning deity, which closely resem- bles contemporaneous representations of the Zapotec deity Cocijo (Gaxiola I978, Winter I994). Certain fea- tures of monumental architecture, such as I-shaped ball courts, adoratorios, and large stone columns are found in both the Oaxaca Valley and the Mixteca at this time. These data suggest that Mixtec elites may have pro- moted and legitimated increasing inequality of wealth and power by adopting aspects of the Zapotec ideology described above (Joyce i99i, I994c). Elites in the Mixteca may also have promoted inter- polity conflict as a way to consolidate power. The data suggest that warfare in the Mixteca may have been more prevalent and destabilizing than in the Oaxaca Valley. All of the Late Formative centers in the Mixteca were constructed with defensive considerations in mind. Monte Negro, Cerro de las Minas, and Diquiyui were constructed on imposing hilltops, while Yucuita and Huamelulpan were built on lower ridges. Defensive walls were built around parts of Yucuita, Cerro de las A D FIG. 4. Oaxacan urns (not to scale), showing the divergence of styles over time in the Valley of Oaxaca and the Mixteca.

Towards the end of the Late Forma- tive, settlement declined significantly at Yucuita, Monte Negro, and Cerro de las Minas, possibly as a re- sult of conflict. The proximity of these sites could have intensified competition and led to frequent and destruc- tive warfare. In addition, Mixtec elites may have had some difficulty in promoting a set of Zapotec-inspired beliefs as a means to political control, perhaps necessi- tating the development of a coercive military force. The evidence from the Mixteca suggests that Late For- mative polities were probably in conflict with each other and possibly also with the Valley of Oaxaca (Joyce i99i:672-73, I994C; Winter Ig8ga:37-38). Yet there is no evidence for the long-term subjugation of any part of the Mixteca by Monte Alb an. It seems more likely that there was a shifting pattern of alliance formation and conflict among elites of the more powerful polities of the Oaxacan highlands. Overall, the data from the Mixteca suggest that elites adopted some ideological innovations from the Valley of Oaxaca. Religion and warfare were also probably linked in the Mixteca through ritual sacrifice and ball- game ceremonialism. Carved into the risers of some of the steps on Temple T at Monte Negro is the circle-and- triangle "blood" glyph (Acosta and Romero I992:32) which appears on carved stones in the Valley of Oaxaca, including on several of the danzantes (Urcid I993:I5I). While the danzantes appear to be explicit representa- tions of sacrificial victims (possibly war captives) who were dispatched during ceremonies on Building L (Mar- cus I976), the carved blood glyph on the risers of Temple T may be a more abstract representation of a similar ceremony (i.e., blood spilled on the temple stairs). The most compelling evidence for the linkage between reli- gion and warfare comes from the Altar de los Craneos at Huamelulpan. This feature is a stone altar located in an elite-administrative precinct (Gaxiola I984). Above the plaster surface of the altar were found four trophy skulls, five Oaxaca Valley-style anthropomorphic urns manufactured locally (including one with a glyph), and prestige goods including several imported shell objects and a greenstone celt. The increasing convergence of elite culture in the Val- ley of Oaxaca and the Mixteca during the Late Formative resembles what Schortman (I989) has termed an elite salient identity network. In this case, elites in the two regions shared an identity characterized by similar ideas and practices related to religion, warfare, and political control. The development of a shared identity would have been advantageous to elites in both regions by dif- erentiating them from nonelites, thereby reinforcing the idea that the elites had a special role in the cosmos. The political importance of maintaining this shared identity would have compelled elites to compete among them- selves for access to prestigious goods, ideas, and social contacts. Thus, while elites benefited from this shared identity, their behavior would also have been con- strained by it. The shared identities of Oaxacan nobles were probably more broadly tied to an elite identity emerging in many regions of Mesoamerica (Joyce I99I: 678-84). Despite a convergence in elite culture between the Mixteca and the Valley of Oaxaca, there appears to have been a trend towards regionalization in aspects of nonelite culture such as ceramic and metate styles (Win- ter Ig8ga:67). The Late Formative seems to have been a time of dra- matic sociocultural change. The size and complexity- architectural, economic, social, and political-of Monte Alb an far exceeded anything that had occurred previ- ously. The Mixtec centers were not as large and complex as Monte Alban, but they too exhibited the organiza- tional properties and settlement characteristics of urban sites (Spores I983 b). Evidence for many of the features that have been used to define the state also appeared for the first time during the Late Formative in highland Oaxaca (Flannery and Marcus I983a; Joyce I99I:663- 64; Kowalewski et al. I989; Spencer i982; Winter I974, I989a). These features included the emergence of dis- tinct social strata, political centralization, elite control of a centralized religion, elite control of production in the form of tribute extraction, elite-sponsored warfare, and a four-tiered settlement hierarchy. It has also been argued that by the Late Formative specialized political decision-making roles had developed among elites (Spencer i982). The changes in sociopolitical organiza- tion during the Late Formative represent the beginnings of a pattern that reached its apogee with the Classic- period polities of Oaxaca. The Classic-Period Institutionalization of Power State societies with complex urban centers emerged in highland Oaxaca by the Classic period (A.D. 200-800). The Classic encompasses Periods IIIa (A.D. 200-500) and lILb-IV (A.D. 500-800) in the Valley of Oaxaca (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta I967). In the Mixteca Alta, it consists of Periods Early III (A.D. 200-400) and Late III (A.D. 400- 600 at Huamelulpan (Gaxiola I984) and the Las Flores phase (A.D. 300-800) in the Nochixtlan Valley (Spores I972). The Classic period in the Mixteca Baja consists of the Nuifie phase (A.D. 300-800 [Winter I989a]). The Late Formative had established the general pattern of urban society in Oaxaca with great inequality in status created and legitimated by an ideology that linked reli- gion and warfare. During the Classic period there appear to have been no major changes in the size and complex- ity of urban centers or in the degree of heterogeneity or the ideological foundations of power. There was, how- ever, increasing institutionalization of power within rul- ing-class families, and there were also important changes in interregional relations and inequality. CLASSIC-PERIOD SOCIETY IN THE VALLEY OF OAXACA During the Classic period, Monte Alban grew to 650 ha, with an estimated population of I 5,000-30,000 (Blanton I978). Monumental construction activities continued in the Main Plaza and elsewhere at the site. The Monte</page><page sequence="11">BLANTON ET AL. Agency, Ideology, and Power | 43 Alban polity probably dominated the entire Valley of Oaxaca (Blanton et al. i982, Kowalewski et al. I989). Data from the Cuicatlan Cafiada suggest, however, that its influence outside the valley may have been declining, possibly because of competition with the huge urban center of Teotihuacan in the Basin of Mexico (Redmond I983:I45-54). Heterogeneity in the Valley of Oaxaca was probably similar to that of the Late Formative. Nonelites pursued a relatively generalized set of social roles including ag- ricultural and domestic activities as well as providing corvee labor to elites. Agricultural practices varied somewhat (Kowalewski et al. i989:204), and specializa- tion continued in the production of lithics and ceramics (Feinman I980, Kowalewski et al. I989) and the pro- cessing of salt (Peterson I976). Elites continued to per- form their specialized roles as political administrators and religious specialists (Flannery I983a, Masson I994, Winter I989a). The production of many elements of elite-ritual culture required highly skilled specialists such as architects, muralists, urn makers, bone carvers, and scribes. Residential data suggest that there were at least three social strata in the Valley of Oaxaca during the Classic period. Social strata are inferred from variation in resi- dence size, number of houses, architectural complexity, wealth of associated artifacts, and proximity to public buildings as well as the wealth and elaboration of mortu- ary customs (Winter I974; I986; i989a:4I-42). Inequality increased considerably during the Classic period, primarily as a result of the growing wealth and power of the elites. The most elaborate residences were monumental in scale and probably accommodated ad- ministrative activities (Flannery I983a, Winter I974). Elite subpatio tombs were made of stone masonry with niches and often included painted murals, carved stone door jambs, and elaborate offerings. The power of Clas- sic-period elites continued to be manifest in their ability to mobilize labor for the construction of monumental structures such as the South Platform at Monte Alba6n and the temple-patio-altar complexes at sites such as Cerro de la Campana, Reyes Etla, and Lambityeco. CLASSIC-PERIOD SOCIETY IN THE MIXTECA While the end of the Formative marked Monte Albain's greatest interregional influence, in the Mixteca it was a time of conflict and instability that resulted in a shift to political power from the Mixteca Alta to the Mixteca Baja (Winter I994). The most influential Classic-period site in the Mixteca seems to have been Cerro de las Minas (Winter I99 I C, I994). Recent research has shown that after a possible decline in settlement at the end of the Formative, Cerro de las Minas grew to 55 ha, with its civic-ceremonial core concentrated on a ridgetop IoO m above the valley floor. It is similar to other centers in the Mixteca in having monumental public buildings and elite residences but distinct in that it was a major center for the production of the elite goods and ideas that in large part define the Nuifie style (Moser I977; Paddock I966; Winter I99IC,I994). These elements of elite culture include (i) painted anthropomorphic urns, often with representations of the old fire god wearing a mask and seated on a square pedestal (fig. 4), (2) a system of hieroglyphic writing, including calendric inscriptions, that differed from writing in the Valley of Oaxaca, (3) carved stone monuments with distinctive iconography (fig. 5), (4) small portable stone sculptures often de- picting human or animal heads, and (5) mold-made re- touched figurines representing humans and animals. Other important Nuifie centers with carved stones, writing, and monumental architecture include Diquiyui and Tequixtepe?. Several sites in the Mixteca Alta also had relatively large populations and monumental architecture. The largest Classic-period center in the Mixteca Alta devel- oped at Yucufiudahui. The site is estimated to have been about 2oo ha in extent and probably had a population of several thousand (Spores I983C:I54). The civic- ceremonial precinct was located on an L-shaped ridgetop with monumental public buildings, tombs, and probable elite residences. Low-status residences were located on terraces along the hillslopes. Despite the size and im- pressive architecture of the Mixteca Alta centers, ar- chaeological investigations have recovered relatively few urns, carved stones, and figurines. These sites ap- pear provincial in comparison with Cerro de las Minas and may have been largely consumers of elite culture and ideology (Winter I994). Social complexity in the Mixteca, as in the Valley of Oaxaca, increased during the Classic period. The limited evidence available at present suggests little heterogene- ity for nonelites. There is evidence for distinct roles in- volving the production of elements of elite culture, in- cluding scribes and architects as well as possible specialists in the production of stone sculpture, onyx vessels, and ceramic urns (Winter I994). Elites in the Mixteca also continued to perform their roles as politi- cal administrators and religious specialists. These roles are suggested by the association of elite residences with public buildings in distinct precincts (Caso I938; Gaxi- ola I984; Spores I983d; Winter i99ia, b, c). Ritual sym- bols and paraphernalia are found primarily in elite resi- dences and tombs. By the Classic period inequality in the Mixteca was great. Elites continued to mobilize large labor forces to build monumental structures at sites such as Yucufiuda- hui, Huamelulpan, and Cerro de las Minas. Elite houses were larger and more elaborate than those of nonelites (Deraga I98I, Gaxiola I984, Montague and Winter I99I, Acosta and Tercero I99I, Winter i9gia, Winter and Acosta I99i), and some high-status residences, such as G3 at Cerro de las Minas, appear to have been palaces. Mortuary data suggest that there may have been three status levels in Classic-period Mixtec society (Caso I938; Deraga I98I; Gaxiola I984; Winter iggia, b). Most burials in the Mixteca were simple graves with as many as io ceramic vessels as offerings. Intermediate burials consisted of rectangular tombs and, at least in the Mixteca Baja, secondary interments in square or</page><page sequence="12">441 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 37, Number i, February I996 FIG. 5. The Huajuapan lintel, a Classic-period Nuinle-style carved stone presumably from Cerro de las Minas, redrawn from Moser (1977). rectangle cists. Both cist burials and rectangular tombs were often reused and contained offerings usually rang- ing from io to 25 vessels, although Tomb 2 at Hua- melulpan had 68 (Gaxiola I984:68-69). Ruling-class elites were interred in stone masonry tombs with square chambers. Only three examples of this type of tomb have been recovered: Cerro de las Minas Tomb 5, Yucu- niudahui Tomb i, and Huamelulpan Tomb 7. Yucu- fiudahui Tomb i contained two painted plaster murals. Offerings consisted of as many as 74 ceramic vessels (in Tomb 5 from Cerro de las Minas) as well as urns, projec- tile points, and beads. The existence of three status lev- els is supported by residential data (Acosta and Tercero I99I, Deraga I98I). IDEOLOGY AND THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF POWER Greater inequality appears to have been the major differ- ence in social organization between the Late Formative and the Classic period in both the Valley of Oaxaca and the Mixteca. Elites created and legitimated increasing inequality and were able to link high status with kin- ship. This linkage is suggested by elite residences occu- pied over long periods and tombs apparently reused by multiple generations of the same family. Ethnohistorical data suggest that this linkage continued until the Span- ish conquest. The restriction of noble status to certain kinship groups would have been another means of natu- ralizing the status quo in favor of elite interests. This pattern contrasts with that of the Late Formative, when high status seems to have been more fluid and was per- haps tied as much to politico-religious institutions as to kinship. The relatively high proportion of elites depicted on carved stones is possibly another indication of the personal and familial power of Classic-period nobles. The control of ritual knowledge and authority by the elites was undoubtedly a major factor in the linkage of power with certain kin groups. Ethnohistorical sources indicate that noble status was inherited and therefore kinship was a major determinant of the ritual abilities of elites to affect the cosmos and, especially after death, become mediators between mortals and supernaturals (Marcus i992b). Classic-period iconographic data from the Valley of Oaxaca suggest an increasing concern with genealogy among the elites. Marcus (I983 C; i992a:28i- 8 3) argues that the painted mural on Monte Alban Tomb I04 depicts living relatives of the deceased along with a venerated ancestor. The fauces del cielo (jaws of the sky) symbol (Caso i928), a common element of Classic- period elite iconography, probably also reflects this con- cern with genealogy. The fauces del cielo is associated with deceased royal ancestors and may reflect their place in the heavens and close association with supernaturals (Marcus igg2a:238; Urcid i992). This concern increased towards the end of the Classic with the introduction of the so-called genealogical regis- ters (Marcus igg2a:238-49). These carved stone slabs depict royal marriages, with the couple shown kneeling beneath the fauces del cielo (fig. 6). Often the slabs in- clude several registers depicting different generations of a royal family and at times what appear to be textual FIG. 6. A Valley of Oaxaca genealogical register showing the fauces del cielo motif (Lacpida MNA-i), redrawn from Urcid (I989).</page><page sequence="13">BLANTON ET AL. Agency, Ideology, and Power | 45 references to genealogy. A near-obsession with geneal- ogy is evident in the Postclassic Mixtec codices (A.D. 8oo-i52i [Smith I973, I983]) and in early colonial docu- ments (Paddock I983a, Parmenter i982). The restriction of noble status to a small number of kin groups may in part reflect the relative stability of political power. Sites such as Monte Albain, Cerro de las Minas, Diquiyu, and Yucuniudahui continued as power- ful urban centers throughout the Classic. There do not appear to have been periods of political instability marked by the collapse of polities as there were during the Late Formative at Yucuita and Monte Negro. We are not suggesting, however, that conflict and competition did not occur during the Classic period. The stability of hierarchical political relations with continued competi- tion among elites is suggested by iconographic and epi- graphic data, at least in the Valley of Oaxaca. At Monte Albain, much of the public art consists of multistela pro- grams depicting bound elite captives (e.g., stela 2) and victorious rulers (e.g., stela I; see fig. 7). A dramatic de- cline in public art (Garcia Moll, Patterson Brown, and Winter i986), however, suggests that elite strategies shifted towards propaganda directed to a restricted audi- ence of other elites (Marcus i992 a:23 8). This is probably best exemplified by the elaborate tomb art of the Classic period, which primarily involved genealogy and rela- tionships with supernaturals. It may be that the death of a noble was a time of crisis for that person's kinship group, requiring affirmation of the ritual authority of the group and the renegotiation of alliances. If threats to political authority came primarily from other elites, the death of a noble may have required intensive propa- ganda, especially if some of the people involved in the mortuary ceremony were potential competitors. Clas- sic-period elites may have been more concerned with competition from other elites than with rebellion by nonelites. Another change involved elite strategies for the cre- ation and dissemination of ideology. During the Late Formative important elements of Mixtec elite culture were appropriated from Monte Albain. There continued to be cross-ties linking the Mixteca, Valley of Oaxaca, and other areas of Mesoamerica. However, by the Clas- sic period elite culture, at least in the Mixteca Baja, had developed distinctive (Nuifie) styles in writing, stone sculpture, monumental architecture, figurines, and urns (Moser I977; Winter I99Ic, I992, I994). This may repre- sent a strategy by elites at Cerro de las Minas and other centers in the Mixteca Baja to assert their own ethnic and political identities. Despite the emergence of the Nuifie style, interac- tions with elites in distant regions of Mesoamerica con- tinued to be an important political strategy of rulers in both the Valley of Oaxaca and the Mixteca. Evidence from throughout Oaxaca suggests that elites were in- volved in the exchange of exotic goods and ideas that continued to symbolize their special status and ritual abilities (Feinman and Nicholas I993, Joyce I993, Mar- cus I983d, Urcid I993, Zeitlin I993). Elite social identi- ties therefore expressed both regional/ethnic affiliations and membership in a group of like-minded elites from other parts of Mesoamerica. Data from highland Oaxaca suggest that elites partici- pated in the extensive interaction network linked to Teotihuacan. These data include stylistic cross-ties in ceramics, iconography, architecture, and writing sys- A B FIG. 7. Classic-period carved stones from the Main Plaza at Monte Alban. A, stela I; B, stela 2, redrawn from Urcid (I992).</page><page sequence="14">46 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 37, Number i, February I996 tems as well as evidence for the exchange of materials such as obsidian, pottery, and mica (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta I967; Joyce I993:75; Marcus I983c; Martinez Lopez I994; Winter I994). Elites in the Valley of Oaxaca may have had relations with Teotihuacan beyond ex- change; the well-known Oaxaca Barrio of Tlailotlacan shows that ethnic Zapotecs lived at Teotihuacan for sev- eral centuries, beginning as early as the end of the Late Formative (Paddock 1983 b; Peeler, Winter, and Peterson I992). A key element in interelite relations during the entire urban period was the exchange of ideas concerning the ideological underpinnings of rulership. It is possible that the continuing success of the Cerro de las Minas and Monte Albain polities was in part due to the success of their rulers in participating in a network of interelite interaction that helped define and legitimate high status throughout Mesoamerica. Sandwiched between these two powerful polities, elites in the Mixteca Alta may have had less success in gaining access to exotic goods and ideas. Conclusions We have described the development of urban society in Oaxaca as resulting from the interplay between the be- havioral strategies of individuals and the biophysical and sociocultural environment. This approach avoids the pitfalls of systems theory and cultural ecology by placing causation with social actors as well as the social and ecological conditions that affect them. For example, we do not view management of irrigation or market sys- tems by the elite as a major causal factor in urban devel- opment as has been argued by cultural ecologists (Sand- ers and Nichols I988:5I; Santley I980) and countered by Oaxacan archaeologists (e.g., Blanton I980, i983a, I988; Blanton et al.Ig8I:70; Feinman and Nicholas I988; Kowalewski I980). We do not rely on population pressure, whether regional (Sanders and Nichols i988; Santley i980:I4I-42) or local (Spencer i982:2i0), as a major causal factor in sociopolitical change, and there- fore we need not attempt to estimate carrying capacity and population levels (see O'Brien and Lewarch i992). Our explanation for interpolity conflict during the Late Formative does not require population pressure as a cause (Sanders and Nichols I988) or increasing tribute extraction as a result (Spencer i982), neither of which has been empirically demonstrated (Joyce I99I:587-98). Instead we explain population growth, craft special- ization, and agricultural intensification as the result of changes in nonelite behavioral strategies that were largely independent of direct managerial control by the elites. We argue that given the cultural and ecological setting of the Late Formative, increasing family size and agricultural production were rational strategies that al- lowed people to generate tribute to pay for the ritual services of rulers living in the urban centers. Craft spe- cialization was a strategy that allowed some people to take advantage of the increasing agricultural focus of most families. Interpolity conflict and monumental art dedicated to themes of conflict were elite strategies to increase group cohesion and mobilize tribute. That these strategies were risky is perhaps demonstrated by the collapse of several Mixtec centers. We recognize both ideological and material conditions as important and inseparable influences in the develop- ment of urban societies. Obviously, large populations with complex social organization arose in regions such as the Valley of Oaxaca because of advantageous ecologi- cal conditions, and economic factors such as craft spe- cialization, exchange, and tribute extraction were im- portant in their development. We argue, however, that an elite strategy of ideological manipulation was a major factor in the origin and development of urban society. Elites manipulated ideology to control religious institu- tions. Their special ritual role created and legitimated their political power and compelled nonelites to provide tribute, leading to increasing inequality. Elites used ide- ology to compel people to move to urban centers and into ecologically unstable piedmont areas, both of which had economic and ecological consequences. Elites also appear to have promoted interpolity conflict as a means of unifying people and extracting resources for military measures. While these ideological innovations appeared first in the Valley of Oaxaca, they were apparently adopted soon thereafter in the Mixteca. During the Classic period, inequality continued to in- crease as elites linked high status and politico-religious authority to kinship. The nature of politico-religious power, at least in the Valley of Oaxaca, shifted from an institutional to a more personal basis (see Grove and Gillespie i 992 a: 35-36), perhaps intermediate between the ruler-centered power of the Maya lowlands (Schele and Freidel I990, Schele and Miller I986) and the imper- sonal, institutional power of Teotihuacan (Cowgill 9gg2a, b). While we have focused on dominant ideologies that supported elite interests, we recognize that nonelites may have developed alternative ideologies that reflected strategies of resistance (Giddens I979:I45-50). It is pos- sible that some of the ideological changes of the urban period were initiated by elites in response to resistance resulting from nonelite penetration of the dominant ide- ology. Nonelites' lack of access to the production of monumental art and other forms of enduring iconogra- phy makes it difficult to identify these strategies in the archaeological record. This highlights the need for fu- ture research that will better define social identities, es- pecially with regard to gender, factional associations, and nonelite occupations (e.g., McCafferty and McCaf- ferty I994). It is possible to show, however, that the behavioral strategies of nonelites had unintended conse- quences. For example, agrarian communities moved into the piedmont in the Valley of Oaxaca during both Periods I and IIIa (Kowalewski et al. I989). While these communities may have gained initially from their close association with Monte Albain, intensive agriculture led to erosion and soil depletion (Joyce and Mueller i992, Mueller and Joyce I993). A few centuries after both pe-</page><page sequence="15">BLANTON ET AL. Agency, Ideology, and Power | 47 riods of piedmont expansion, many of these communi- ties collapsed. Elites were not immune from the long-term conse- quences of their behavioral strategies. While elite status increased dramatically during the Late Formative and Classic, it is possible that the ideology that legitimated their power also contributed to its sudden collapse. The collapse of Classic-period polities is not well under- stood, although it probably involved a combination of ecological, economic, and sociopolitical factors (Blanton I983a, Culbert I973, Winter Ig8gb). It is possible that as factors such as environmental degradation, warfare, and inequality intensified, people began to question the dominant ideology. The relatively sudden collapse of sites like Monte Albain, Cerro de las Minas, and Yucufiu- dahui might have occurred when people abandoned the dominant ideology as well as the rulers it supported (see Habermas I975). The shared identity of elites might also have facilitated the collapse of many Mesoamerican pol- ities between about A.D. 700 and goo. If the dominant ideology could be overthrown or abandoned in one re- gion, there would be greater reason to question it in oth- ers. Regardless of the causes for decline of the urban centers, it would seem that the elite strategies that had held these polities together for centuries ceased to be effective. We do not know whether the final collapse was peaceful or violent, but it certainly would not have occurred in a vacuum. Other leaders probably took over in the resulting chaos and began to recast their ideology to support the developing political relations of the Post- classic city-states.</page></plain_text>
