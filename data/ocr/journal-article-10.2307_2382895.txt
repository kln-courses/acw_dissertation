The graph is a drawing. flACn SW: a man represented by his legs. jen The B-forms oL this character show clearly that originally it was a JIN, drawing of a man's whole body. Jung Keng $:9 (in ch. 8 of his Chin- NIN wen-pien ; says that the three characters Jl, -k and R are really only different representations of the idea "man". A is a man standing seen from the side, in e (and in the somewhat shortened from R) the "man" is shown kneeling. Since the original meaning of this character was "body of man", the pronunciation of A is related to that of ?. (62) )X Y1 Y, Y3 Y4 B1 B2 B3 84 B5 S *t'ien K 361: heaven. The graph is a drawing of an anthropomorphic deity. t'ien SW: logical compound of - and ;k. tien The older forms of this character show a man standing, especially TEN emphasizing the head. * For the first part of this article see Mon. Nipp. Vol. VIII p. 193 ff., where also a list of abbreviations is given.</page><page sequence="2">Chinese Characters 259 Its original meaning may be made clear from the pronunciation TEN, which SW explains as l, which is further explained by SWC as. meaning "the head of man" (AX). However, this first meaning of X was already forgotten at a very early time so that in the oldest documents. this character is almost always used for -heaven or sky. (63) Y1 Y2 Y3 Y4 Y5 B1 B2 B3 B4 S K *miok K 1036: eye. The graph. is a drawing. miuk SW: a drawing of the eye. MOKU As appears from the history of the character 1, it is only the original form put vertically (see also the explanation. given in SWSL). The pronunciation seems to be related to that of ,- (*Xmdk, Xak~, HOKU, black) and AM (*mdk, mak, mo, BOKU, ink,.black). (64)j r r Y1 Y2 Y3 Y4 Y5 B1 B2 B3 B4 S *m;r K 576: eyebrow. The graph is a drawing. mjwi SW: a drawing of the hairs above the eyes, the of the S-form representing mei the lines on the forehead. BI As is clearly shown in the older forms of this character, the A in the S-form must be explained with SWCC as a drawing of the eyebrows. The pronunciation seems to be related to that of M (*miwer, mjwei, wei, BI, small) (see 1Nfl, '2FM* , where , is used instead of Jh).</page><page sequence="3">260 JO5ken Kat6 (65) 1 j aL Y, Y2 B1 B2 S *k'u K 110: mouth. The graph is a drawing. k'Vu SW: a drawing of the mouth. k'ou To the pronunciation of this character Jao Hsiang IAMi says (in KO Shuo-we'n-chieh-tzu-pu-shou-ting ; ch. 2) that the sound KO is used to designate any kind of holes. (66)p- j z v t .L dL Y, Y2 Y3 S S S K K 961: front teeth. ts'tg SW: phonetic compound of IN (drawing of teeth) and ih (p,ronunciation). ch'ih SW does not distinguish between the characters - and T (*nga, nga SHI ya, GA, tooth). However, judging from the different forms given above and their use, it must be inferred that 1 is the original form of 3f, while B represents the .rows of teeth in the mouth. SWTS explains the pronunciation SHI of 0 as meaning to be arranged in a line. (67) t t ;&gt; 0 B1 B2 S k idm K 624: yawn. Explanation of graph uncertain. k'ivm SW: to open one's mouth wide. Graph composed of ? and A. ch'ien KENn The B-forms of this character show its original meaning which is that given by SW. The lower part is a shortened form of A, a kneeling man, while the upper part represents an open mouth. The mneaning of the !whole character is to yawn; see E1t, 7?00!2, X9, 0&gt;tR% l , The pronunciation KEN means originally insufficient, little (t, i0); therefore the Shuo-wen-chieh-tzil-pu-shou-ting says: AAXZTX, MAXZ eIJ. The ? in the S-form is an abbreviation of t.</page><page sequence="4">Chinese Characters 261 (68) B S K *ts)'ir K 555: to arrange in order; second. The graph has 'two', meaning of the ts'i other element uncertain. ts'u SW: phonetic compound of X (meaning) and - (pronunciation). JI The meaning of- this character is defined by SWCC as iL,2&gt;, where the character iL is a representation of the sound element of &gt;k: two su.ccessive respirations. The K-form is explained by SWTS as being the primary form of'. (69)? CZZ Y, Y2 B 1 B2 S K *kidd K 515: SW says: to belch; but there are no text examples whatever in support 7m of ths h khi of this. The graph shows a kneeling person. chi SW: a xeverse form of k. KI As has been pointed out already by Lo Chen-yii (in his lR*S:fii ch. 8), the S- and K-forms of this character must be considered as copyist's mistakes. Moreover, the author of SW is mistaken when4 he thinks that such a reversement of the form of a character involves also a change of the meaning. Close study of the Y- and B-forms of characters shows that the meaning of a character is not affected by the fact that it is some- times turned to the right side and sometimes to the left. In the char- acter ;% the direction of the kneeling person is the same as in the char- acter k, while the mouth is opened in the opposite direction. The explanation given by SW ( El ,) is correct as far as it goes, but 'iM and TMN, are not limited to the times of eating and drinking. The character seems to imply all kinds of difficulty in breathing. The pronunciation KI is derived from Q (* -. ik, .iak, i, Al, EKI, AKU, throat) or N (* .g, .ai, ai, Al, YAKU narrow, constrained). See also PHS tf, A % ad voc. .</page><page sequence="5">262 J6ken Kat6 Y' Y2 Y3 Y4 Y5 B1 B2 S K nfjg K 981: ear. The graph is a drawing. n, z, i SW: a drawing of the ear. erh As to the reason why this character is read JI, Jao Hsiang in the Ji Shuo-wen-chieh-tztu-pu-shou-ting (ch. 12) declares: "Because the two ears are attached to the right and left side of the head as if they were hem- ming in the face, the pronunciation of ; is that of At (two)." (7 1) A )k 1 \ 1L \ Y' Y2 Y3 Y4 Y5 B1 B2 B3 B5 S K dzi K 1237: self, onigi'n, from. The graph is said to be a drawing of a nose tzu and occurs in this sense as radical in F. JI SW: drawing of a nose. e , is the original character, meaning nose; 4, the character now in use in that sense is of later date and was formed through the addition of- the sound element A (*pied, pji, pi, HI) to M, representing the meaning. As to the pronunciation of this character I should like to connect it with that of Ii (*t'iwed, ts'wi, ch'u, SUI, SHUTSU, to bring out): the nose protruding (3tIi) from the face. This character in the meaning of self may be explained simply as a loan. SWCC, however, says that this meaning is derived from the fact that people speaking of themselves point at their noses.</page><page sequence="6">Chinese Characters 263 (72) f B1 B2 B3 S K StOg K 1101: hand. The graph is a drawing. lA'u SW: a drawing of the hand. SHU The pronunciation of this character, according to SWCC, is related to that of 4 (*d'iag, J'i, ch'ih, JI, to hold). (73) Y, Y2 B1 B2 B3 S * K 1111: claw; cut the nails. The graph is a drawing. In compound char- o?g acters the element mostly means 'hand'. chau SW: a dxawing representing the turned down palm of one's hand. chao So The explanation given by SW is to the point, for 1Y is the opposite of in, the upturned palm of the hand. The pronunciation SO seems to be derived from that of X *ts'iu, ts'ju, ch'ii, SHU, ta take). (7 4)t&gt; ? ; *tsg K 112: SW saysi: claw, nail, thus taking it to be a variant of J11; but there tsau are no text examples in support of this. The graph is a drawing. chao SHao This character, being a combination of 7, (hand) and (nails), is So the primary form of the character W. (nail, claw). In the explanation given in SW (nails of fingers and toes) the first meaning has been some- what expanded. As to the pronunciation, there seems to be a relation to that of E (see No. 16).</page><page sequence="7">264 J6ken Kat-6 Y' Y2 Y3 Y4 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 S *fjlg K 961: foot, to stop. The graph, which is a drawing of a foot, is mostly used IS'i both in the bone and the bronze inscriptions as loan for the homophonous Z chih in its various meanings. SHI SW: drawing of plants and trees coming out of the ground. The character iL is, as shown by its older forms, a drawing of a foot. From among the SW-commentaries SWC wasi the first who explained- it in this way. The pronunciation SHI is obtained by sound shift from that of 4 (*kiag, kji, chi, KI, base, foundation). ,(76);)i z &lt; w r Y' Y2 Y3 Y4 Y5 B1 B2 S K *b'o K 73: to walk. The graph shows two feet making a step. In the Yin bone b'uo inscriptions, the character is often enlarged by ff. pu SW: combination of two opposite feet, iL and--h. liO The forms Y1 and Y2 of this character are the primary forms of a character *, while Y3, B1 and B2 are those of the character 0 (according to SW of k). Since ff (or abbreviated 4) means originally crossroads, the meaning of the whole character is to walk on a crossroads. In the from t the ff was omitted, leaving only the meaning to walk. The origin of the pronunciation is not clear. It may be related to e-t (*b'iu, b'iu, fu, FU, to be added to).</page><page sequence="8">Chinese Characters 265 (77a)X C, 0 Y4 Y2 Y3 Y Y5 Y6 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 S1 S2 *tsiuk K 1219: foot. The graph has iL 'foot' and a circle above of uncertain inter- tsiwok pretation. tsu SW: logical compound of M: and l1. SOKU (77b);E Si S2 *sio iiwo K 90: foot. The archaic graph was probably a drawing shu SW: logical compound of M:h and 0, a drawing. S140 (77c)j - _ K1 K2 K3 SI S2 *tenjg K 833: straight, correct, right. Since the radical 'is 'foot', the graph is probably tJjdng the primary form for iE, which is etymologically the same word. cheng SW: logical compound of iL and SEI Chinese scholars agree that these three characters are derived from t-he same original form (about their theories see SWKL), but as to the meaning of that original form, the B-forms of i-, their opinions are divided; SWTS combines them all and declares that these B-forms represent a man's leg from the knee down to the heel. The pronunciation SOKU, according to the Shih-ming (OZOX50) has the meaning of M (*dziuk, ziwok, hsii, ZOKU, to continue).</page><page sequence="9">266 J6ken Kat6 k78)iT jc IL )t )K )t )' )K / \ Ir mr -1r th Ch Y1 Y2 Y3 Y4 B1 B2 B3 B4 S S2 *gang K 748: street, to go. The graph is said to be a drawing of meeting streets (?). rvng SW: logical compound of 4 and -, to walk. hsing The explanation given by SW is completely mistaken. SWCC has KO already connected it by declaring that fe means a street. Lo Chen-yii (ch. 2 of his RWmt4:) is more explicit when he says that the first forms of this character clearly represent a crossroads. (79):i i V B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 S K1 K2 *kek K 931: hide, skin. The graph is a drawing. kek SW: drawing of the hide of an animal from which the hair has been scraped ko off. KAKU The explanation of this character as given in SW and admitted by almost all commentators seems to be wrong. In my opinion X is the skeleton of an animal which, having been exposed to rain and wind, has become white (cf. the character 3f = the white light V of the moon Ji). The pronunciation KAKU has the meaning of f0 (*kldk, k,vk, ko, KAKU, bones). In the word ziq: this character is used as a loan for i. Similarly the use of g in the meaning of hide, skin is a loan based on the whiteness of the inside of hides and skins.</page><page sequence="10">Chinese Characters 267 B4 B2 S1 S2 S3 K, K2 *b'ia K 25: skin. Explanation of graph uncertain. b'jii SW: phonetic compound of XZ (meaning) and A (pronunciation). p i Judging fitoia what SW says about characters like .2 or BE, the HI character A is a drawing of a hand (of a man?) grasping someone's (a woman's?) buttocks. The pronunciation HI is derived by sound shift from that of A (*iniog, nizjqu, jou, JU, soft). (81) Y, Y2 Y3 B1 B2 S xiang K 714: SW says: fragrance of grain. There are no text examples of this, xiang but since it occurs in the sense of 0 'feast', and since it -recurs as a drawing hsiang df a vessel in m2 IR M 9? l it, it is obviously etymologically the same KEI word: fragrant food, feast. The graph is, as just stated, a drawing of a food KYO vessel. KO The explanation given by SW cannot be admitted. From Y2 it is clear that this character represents a filled food vessel. The characters given by SW to explain the meaning of 9 (4, 6) may serve to clear up the question of the pronunciation of this character: it indicates the fragrant smell of the food in the vessel. Y' Y2 Y3 B1 B2 S tsiet K 399: go to, forthwith, thereupon. Explanation of graph uncertain. -chi SW: phonetic compound of E (meaning) and P (pronunciation). Shi SOKU In his compound character the sound element (a kneeling person)</page><page sequence="11">268 Joken Kato also enters the meaning of the whole: a person kneeling in front of a food vessel. Therefore the definition given by SWHC (A*ti) is correct. The pronunciation SOKU is derived by sound shift from SHU (cf. the character J which is also pronounced as SHU and SOKU). (83) E f000 \T Y, Y2 Y3 B1 B2 B3 S *kPd K 515: to complete a repast. The graph shows a kneeling person and a food kie vessel. chi SW: phonetic compound of E (meaning) and !% (pronunciation). KI This character is a compound character of E and :% in which the meanings of both parts enter the meaning of the whole: to eat as much as to have difficulty with breathing. The definition a little repast (.J-A) is wrong. The pronunciation KI represents, according to the Kuang-ya Al the meaning finished (FE3-W); the whole character, therefore together with with its pronunciation, aptly describes the situation at the end of a hearty meal. (8 4) = X i T 0 g _rt -7 Y' Y2 Y3 B1 B2 S K1 K2 ngjan K 251: big flute; loan for id. speak. The graph is a drawing of a kind of ngirn flute. yen SW: Phonetic compound of LI (meaning) and ': (pronunciation). GEN The explanation of this character as a kind of flute is based on only a few exceptional forms. SW is right when it gives i3 as a phonetic compound; only the element indicating the pronunciation is not e but 4 (*sien, sien, hsin, SHIN). Judging from the character , given in the Yii-p'ien 1, , this e seems to stand for 6C?. This would give to ] the meaning: the heart coming out of the mouth, which is given also in the Fa-yen itk-gt. The pronunciation GEN is obtained from SHIN by sound shift.</page><page sequence="12">Chinese Characters 269 (85) X B1 B2 S * X2m K 653: sound, tone. The graph may be a drawing of a mouth blowing a *iem flute, cf. &gt;. yin SW: logical compound of - and . IN, ON As Kuo Mo-jo has pointed out (in E C ch. 2), 1 and ' are originally identical characters, the difference in meaning being indi- cated by a - or a -. The pronunciation IN, ON is the result of a sound shift from the pronunciation GEN of I. (86) _ ITXT T, T finT. Y' Y2 Y3 Y ' Y5 B1 B2 B3 B4 S K *d'iqr K 553: sign, signify, show. The graph possibly designs the stalks used in dz'i divination, laid out in different patterns? shih SW: symbol showing influx coming from heaven. SHI Sun Hai-p'o in his Chia-ku-wen-pien explains the Y-form T of this character as being a drawing of the ancestor tablet, but since the shape of the old tablets is not known, it is difficult to agree with this opinion. The theory given given by Kuo Mo-jo (in Chia-ku-hsiish-wen-tzut-p'ien EP*C?VX) according to which this form is a representation of a phallic deity is without foundation. As to the Y-form )iT, which in the case of the character Tl is also written T11, Lo Chen-yii thinks that the four dots are a drawing of wine poured out before the gods. T'ang Lan WAR (in his Ku-wen-tzu-hsiieh-tao-lun t3i$#4fm) seems to give the true explanation when he says that the form T represents a table which, in my opinion, was used as a place for the impersonator (P) -during sacrifices.</page><page sequence="13">270 J6ken Kat6 The pronunciation SHI seems to be related to that of X (*ifjr, tfie, chih, SHI, to place).

TEI Many scholars think that this character represents a man clad in long robes (see SWKL). However, the Y- and B-forms show that it is composed of T and H. The T here means again the sacrificial table (see No. 86 or&lt;), while the X (= X and are posts put under the table. The table must have been very big if such special posts were necessary, and it might therefore be assumed that it was the table used for the sacrifice of the Supreme Being. The pronunciation TEI seems to be.related to that of ;k (*d'dd, d'di, ta, DAI, great). (8 8)+ t , ; Y1 Y2 Y3 Y4 YS B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B5 S K1 K2 *giwang K 739: king. Explanation of graph uncertain. iiwang SW: symbol of a man connecting heaven, earth and man. wang Modern writers like Lo Chen-yui, Lin I-kuang and others (see SWKL) 0 explain this character as a representation of fire inside the earth, while Kuo Mo-jo thinks that it is of phallic origin. The true explanation, however, seems to be that given by Wu Ch'i-ch'ang. (in kt:M0,</page><page sequence="14">Chinese Characters 271 :R:*B4j_IJV,) who says that I originally is a battle axe, the instrument with which the future king conquers the land. The pronunciation 0 probably is derived from that of 9f (* piwo, p iu, fu, FU, axe). (89)9)IiI Y1 Y2 Y3 B2 B1 B3 S K ngiuk K 1216: jade. The graph must be some kind of drawing. ngjiwok SW: drawing of three precious stones on a thread. YU The older forms of this character differed from the character EE GYOKU in this that 3E, being a drawing of an axe, was written X, while in the case of X the distance between the parallel strokes was the same. The dot is a recent addition to distinguish better the modern forms. Originally the character 3E is a drawing of threaded precious stones. The meaning of the K-form is uncertain. The pronunciation GYOKU seems to be related to that of the char- acter Oh (* k'iuk, k'iwok, ch'ii, KYOKU, to bend, bent). (90) y b Y, Y2 Y3 YB 81 S K *puk K 1210: to divine by tortoise-shell or bone. The graph shows the divination puk cracks in the shell or bone. Pu SW: draw'ing of divination cracks in the tQrtoise shell. BOKU The pronunciation BOKU of this character is onomatopoetic of the crackling sound made by the tortoise shell or bone when heat is applied. *jiam '4 Y2 Y3 Y Y5 Y6 SK tchan K 618: prognosticate. The graph has 'mouth' and 'divination'. SEN SW: logical compound of [F and .</page><page sequence="15">272 J6ken Kat6 Strictly speaking the explanation given by SW should be corrected into logical compound of f and an abbreviation of ;. The pronunciation SEN is derived by sound shift from that of l 4 (*tsidr, tsi, tzau, SHI, to consult). (92) Y, Y2 Y3 Y4 Y5 B1 B2 B3 S *tieng K 834: divination. The graph was really only an application of JD *tieng fiang 'cauldron' as loan for *ti6ng 'divination inquiry'. But in this application the cheng character was mostly less explicit, and reduced to a few summary lines. TEI SW: Phonetic compound of f (meaning) and A, which stands here for X (pronunciation). The pronunciation TEI is derived from that of if (*tieng, tieng, ting, TEI, cauldron).

SHI Judging from its B-forms, this character was originally 'a drawing of</page><page sequence="16">Chinese Characters 273 a spoon.

HOg About this character Hsiu Chung-shu U1i1f in Chi-k'an JkfJ (I, 1) proposes a theory which seems to be more in accordance with its original forms. According to him 1j is the drawing of a ploughshare. (See also the primitive form h of the character )J, knife.) As to the meaning of the pronunciation HO, it seems to indicate the sharp point of the ploughshare (cf. the character 0 *p'iung, p'iwong feng, HO, point of -a weapon).

Ju NIO According to Ting Shan, the character A is originally the same as the JO, NIO character , (see Mon. Nipp. VIII, p. 197), namely, the drawing of a primitive house. The meaning to enter, therefore, is a secondary mean- ing.

Ch'en Ch'i-t'ung DVM, in his Shuo-wen-i-i A,;MA, explains the ?r*t*ti as X"Mik, and contends that wheat was brought to China only by the Chou people. Since, however, the character 3* is found very often in Yin inscriptions, this theory lacks historical foundation.
