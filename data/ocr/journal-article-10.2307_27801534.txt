American Sociological Association 2010 DOI: 10.1177/0003122410372226 http://asr.sagepub.com (DSAGE Michaela DeSoucey' Abstract By developing the concept of "gastronationalism," this article challenges conceptions of the homogenizing forces of globalism. I analyze (1) the ways in which food production, distribu tion, and consumption can demarcate and sustain the emotive power of national attachment and (2) how nationalist sentiments, in turn, can shape the production and marketing of food. The multi-methodological analyses reveal how the construct of gastronat?onalism can help us better understand pan-national tensions in symbolic boundary politics?politics that protect certain foods and industries as representative of national cultural traditions. I first analyze the macro-level dimensions of market protections by examining the European Union's pro gram for origin-designation labels that delineates particular foods as nationally owned. The micro-level, empirical case?the politics surrounding foie gras in France?demonstrates how gastronat?onalism functions as a protectionist mechanism within lived experience. Foie gras is an especially relevant case because other parties within the pan-national system consider it morally objectionable. Contemporary food politics, beyond the insights it affords into symbolic boundary politics, speaks to several arenas of sociological interest, including markets, identity politics, authenticity and culture, and the complexities of globalization. Keywords food politics, culture, markets, nationalism, European Union Efforts within the European Union (EU) to create a unifying, pan-European sense of iden tity have generated tensions within and among nations over the principles of universalism and exceptionalism. Scholars of European integra tion politics often cite religion, language, eth nic composition, or region to illustrate how nations seek to preserve (or overcome) their sense of distinctiveness (Bail 2008; Brubaker 1996; Calhoun 2007; Keating 2004) and to construct symbolic unity through everyday talk and social practice (Billig 1995). Such practices, which communicate the value of national distinctiveness, have recently been theorized through the frames of branding (Aronczyk 2007) and impression management (Rivera 2008). Few analyses, however, scruti nize related institutional strategies and how material objects and industries are legitimated and protected as uniquely representative of national traditions.

Scholarship in organizational sociology increasingly recognizes that markets and poli tics depend on embedded codes and cultural understandings (Rao, Monin, and Durand 2003, 2005; Vasi 2007; Weber, Heinze, and DeSoucey 2008). We know surprisingly little, however, about relationships among regulated markets, political institutions, and national cultural identities. Examining nationalized protections for certain objects, namely foods, contributes to ongoing debates about the per meability of national boundaries within the EU's pan-national structures (Checkel and Katzenstein 2009; Fligstein 2008; Held et al. 1999) and about the ways in which globaliza tion spurs resistance to culturally homogeniz ing trends (Appadurai 2001; Ritzer 2003; Thompson and Arsel 2004; Watson 1997). My aim here is not to generate a theory of European integration based on food politics, but to delineate how foods constitute cultural and material resources that affect and respond to political agendas. Indeed, within the con temporary EU, food is a contested medium of cultural politics that demarcates national boundaries and identities. Historians and anthropologists have embraced the theme of food, culture, and society in their scholarship (Douglas 1984; Goody 1982; Mintz 1985; Scholliers 2001; Watson and Caldwell 2005), and food studies are increasingly recognized for their ability to integrate multiple research areas and methods (Belasco and Scranton 2002; Freedman 2007). The sociological relationship between food and globalization is an especially rich juxtaposition because it highlights the dialectic produced by global ism's homogenizing tendencies and the appearance of new forms of identity politics invigorated by an increasingly homogenous environment (Berger and Huntington 2002; Inglis 2005). I conceptualize this juxtaposi tion as gastronationalism.1 Examining the political construction of foods as institutionalized vehicles of national cultural identities sheds rich theoretical light on debates between European integrationists and protec tionists (Brubaker 1996; Fligstein 2008; Opp 2005; Prib?n 2007). Gastronationalism, in par ticular, signals the use of food production, distri bution, and consumption to demarcate and sustain the emotive power of national attach ment, as well as the use of nationalist sentiments to produce and market food. First, I examine how responses to globalizing markets have assumed a distinct organizational form?a form that prizes conceptions of tradition and authenticity as desirable rationales for protecting certain foods at the national level (Hobsbawm and Ranger 1983; Scares 1997; Shils 1981). The EU's national-origin labeling program cou ples foods' market status with valorized cultural prowess tied to national identity, characterizing and revaluing national food as a central part of the national diet. This language of authenticity assists the development of narratives about geography-based particularities of cultivating plants and animals for eating (Bell and Valentine 1997). Then, building on Burawoy's (1991, 1998) extended case method and drawing on the case of foie gras in France, I examine these macro level processes as they are harnessed, mani pulated, and re-created at micro-interactional levels. Gastronationalism, as a form of claims making and a project of collective identity, is responsive to and reflective of the political ram ifications of connecting nationalist projects with food culture at local levels. It presumes that at tacks (symbolic or otherwise) against a nation's food practices are assaults on heritage and cul ture, not just on the food item itself. How does an object vilified in some lo cales become morally and politically justi fied as traditional, authentic, and worthy of protected status in others? Foie gras, the fat tened liver of a force-fed duck or goose, is valorized as a symbol of French national identity, history, and culinary culture. It is also a target of critical opposition, fueled by international animal rights organizations.</page><page sequence="3">434 American Sociological Review 75(3) This dualism exposes salient questions regarding social spaces for objects or prac tices seen as morally problematic within new, potentially adversarial, pan-national relationships. VEHICLES OF COLLECTIVE NATIONAL IDENTITY National cultural boundaries are problematic objects of study because their emphasis on universal features obscures contradictory sub cultures, cultural diffusion, and the ways in which cultural policies are open to multiple interpretations (Dobbin, Simmons, and Garrett 2007). Any single definition of "nation" will legitimate some claims and de legitimate others (Opp 2005). Yet, improved understanding of the flexibility of national identity is essential for assessing its role within integration politics in Europe and beyond (Fligstein 2008; Keating 2004). I use Brubaker's (1996:10) broad defini tion of nationalism?a set of idioms, practi ces, and possibilities available in cultural and political life, delimited by social or phys ical boundaries?to consider the ways in which a nation's people are defined, or self define, as a distinct group. Such practices help people learn who they are through inter actions and social life (Brubaker and Cooper 2000). Anderson's (1991) description of a nation as an "imagined community" like wise proposes that we regard national identity as a phenomenon of collective belonging. Claims to nationhood are not just internal appeals to common descent; they allege uniqueness vis-?-vis other nations, substantiat ing potential claims for future distinctions (Zerubavel 1995). Nationalist symbols and practices, such as flags and anthems, can be emotionally charged signs of independence that demon strate a country's social circumstances at the time of their adoption (Cenilo 1995). These objects unite citizens around shared practices such as saluting or singing (Firth 1973; Hobsbawm and Ranger 1983). When it comes to symbolic power and implications for iden tity politics, food is no exception. Foods offer links between social actors and their cultural pasts (Gabaccia 1998), shared bonds of famil ial or religious identity (DeVault 1991; Ray 2004), and narratives of organizational iden tity (Fine 1996; Maurer 2002). For example, a social comparison such as "we eat pork, they don't" articulates tropes of similarity and otherness through shared consumption patterns and prohibitions. Food and eating are expressions of culture and shapers of iden tity; they are potential sources of material and political valuation. Gastronationalism connects foods' social and cultural attributes to politics by making the material, commercial, and institutional processes that shape foods the very objects of investigation. Such dynamics are seldom topics of sociological inquiry in their own right, but there are notable exceptions. These include Mennell's (1985) examination of the powerful forces implicated in the development of ideas around taste in certain foods and cuisines as cross-class markers of French and British nationhood; Warde's (1997, 2009) studies of consumption that his toricize relationships among foods' exchange and status, and the recent "invention" of British cuisine as a symbolic tool of nation building; and Ferguson's (1998, 2004) explo ration of how French cuisine's historical development was strategically linked to brokers of cultural ideology. Ferguson, in particular, contends that gastronomy provided nineteenth-century France with a distinct identity?a kind of "culinary nationalism." This prior work shows how foods function symbolically as markers of identity and com munity for otherwise geographically, socially, and politically divided populations. Moreover, it reveals how food can be an important arena where conflicts over globalization's pan nationalist impacts are fought. In cases of gastronationalism, the state intervenes in the market, acting as an ideological agent and a broker for food production and distribution</page><page sequence="4">DeSoucey 435 as cultural goods. Gastronationalism thus con nects macro- and micro-level concerns around globalism, from the state to food producers' and consumers' lived experiences. CULTURAL PATRIMONY AND PROTECTIONIST ROOTS IN THE EU Because gastronationalism is situated in the context of integration politics, I draw on institutional theories of state-market relation ships to help explain recent institutional des ignations of "tradition" and "patrimony." These theories illustrate how regulatory structures operationalize national (and inter national) systems of political values (Bartley 2007; Prasad 2006). Moreover, add ing food to these networks of institutional re lationships builds on insights from economic sociologists' growing interest in meaning making and cultural work within market state systems (Dobbin 2004; Fligstein 2008; Fourcade-Gourinchas and Healy 2007; Zelizer 2005). From the perspective of orga nizational theory, this integration has great promise for incorporating agency and politics into cultural and institutional analyses. The Treaty of Maastricht officially cre ated the European Union (EU) on November 1, 1993. Before then, this associa tion was known as the European Economic Community or the Common Market. The Common Market was created post-World War II to stimulate economic integration, create shared political values, and offer a powerful voice in international relations (Bremerton and Vogler 1999; Laible and Barkey 2006). Today, the EU is composed of 27 member states, and the basic principle of free trade?that open and competitive markets optimize resources?operates as the dominant mechanism for resource allocation, the circulation of goods and services, and policy formation. Policymakers, however, have long argued that certain cultural goods (particularly audiovisual goods) should be considered cultural exceptions and external to free trade (Gordon and Meunier 2001; Ridler 1986). This idea stems from the 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which called for European countries to "protect national cultural trea sures of artistic, historical, or archaeological value" in the deregulation of markets (GATT 1947). Supporters often frame these arguments for recognizing "cultural excep tions" or "cultural patrimony" within inter national trade and policy agreements as a country's right, or even duty, to preserve and promote its cultural heritage and prevent "irretrievable loss" (Bishop 1996:187). "Cultural exceptions" refer mainly to claims for protection of specific types of cul tural goods (namely film, television, and music) within EU member states, or similar types of media products that celebrate national culture (Ahearne 2003). These claims incor porate the principles that the production of cul tural goods is necessarily place-specific and that global markets are affected by unequal starting points, unbalanced resources, and strategic competition from dominant market players (e.g., Hollywood for films) (Barber 1996; Prowda 1997). "Cultural patrimony" describes what is fundamental to a people's or a nation's history; it weds materialist and symbolic interests as intrinsic to reinforcing, reflecting, and influencing a group's values and collective identity (Hoffman 2006). Cultural patrimony is not owned by a people; rather, it represents their self-defined collec tive national identity. In this sense, it is similar to notions of folklore or heritage. For example, while old paintings can be considered cultural property, Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper and Botticelli's Birth of Venus are classified as Italian cultural patrimony. Supporters of both types of claims have tied them to the perceived negative effects of Americanization, globalization, and pan European homogenization (Meunier 2005). These claims play an important role in cur rent ideological battles over the European project (Men?ndez ?larcon 2004). Although</page><page sequence="5">436 American Sociological Review 75(3) national industries are typically not included in these definitions, I contend that gastrona tionalism facilitates national claims of cultural patrimony for foods because it per forms similar symbolic boundary work in creating exceptions, under the veneer of cul ture, within otherwise open-market struc tures. In setting institutional precedents for resource-based claims of cultural and national specificity (Kockel 2007), cultural exception designations for media help con textualize new national categories for pro tecting food in the face of expanding globalist dynamics. METHODS, DATA, AND RESULTS My multimethod approach explores gastrona tionalism's macro and micro dimensions within contemporary European food politics. To theoretically develop and empirically cap ture gastronationalism as an institutional con struct, I created a database containing every foodstuff (N = 790) that received protected national status under the EU's designation of origin program between the program's estab lishment in 1992 and December 31, 2007. I then analyzed emergent patterns across the 21 countries claiming these labels, using small-N research methods (Mahoney 2000). I also collected and analyzed materials related to several instances of contentious politics that resulted from this labeling program; these ma terials include news articles, academic and trade conference proceedings, industry and producer Web sites, application and registra tion documents, EU case law,2 and food his tory books. To investigate gastronationalism's micro level complexities and the implications of these dynamics, I conducted an in-depth case analysis of foie gras in France, a food item with morally contested production methods. During 2006 and 2007, I collected primary data during four months of ethno graphic f?eldwork at 10 foie gras farms and 7 production facilities (ranging in size from a 2-person to a 250-person operation), a Parisian gourmet food exposition, local outdoor markets (including march?s du gras), tourist offices, foie gras museums, shops, restaurants, and a hotel management school. I conducted 40 interviews with French foie gras producers, high-level indus try representatives, social movement acti vists, consumers, chefs, tourism employees, and local government officials. I conducted the interviews primarily in French; a few, de pending on a respondent's comfort level with the English language, were in English. The majority of interviews were one to two hours in length. I had a portion of the interviews transcribed and transcribed the remainder myself. All French to English translations are my own. On my first research trip, I contacted pro ducers, chefs, and industry members through a "foie gras amateur guide" (Serventi 2002) and through academic connections in Paris, Dijon, Lyon, and Toulouse. These initial contacts allowed for snowball sampling, which proved advantageous. Intermediaries were often necessary for me, as an American who was sometimes viewed with skepticism, to gain access. During my second research trip in 2007, I traveled and con ducted interviews alongside an American journalist who was also writing about foie gras controversies (Caro 2009). This journal ist had access to respondents I would not oth erwise have been able to interview. Beyond these new interviews, I also conducted follow-up interviews with several 2006 re spondents. Finally, I undertook content anal yses on materials produced inside and outside France related to foie gras history and politics: news articles from Le Monde, the International Herald Tribune, and Agence France-Presse; Web sites and list servs; opinion pieces; industry newsletters and materials (including videos, in-house materials, and trade publications from Rougi?, France's largest foie gras producer); tourism materials collected from local</page><page sequence="6">DeSoucey 437 offices; food history books accessed at the Biblioth?que Nationale and purchased in French bookstores; EU documents regarding foie gras production; and transcripts of French National Assembly and Senate debates. The Cultural Exception for Traditional Foods From the EU's inception, the development of integrated agricultural policies and a common market for food products?the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)?has been a core activity. Indeed, some argue that the EU's estab lishment was a purposeful step toward making food and agricultural products more competi tive internationally (Sarasua, Scholliers, and Van Molle 2005). Agriculture absorbs 50 percent of the EU's annual budget, and CAP plays a central role in mediating trade, improv ing rural standards of living, and regulating public funds for food transport and research development. The legal underpinnings of EU gover nance of food production, distribution, and marketing make claims for national specific ity both salient and problematic. According to the regulatory principle of mutual recogni tion (Article 28 EC), a food product lawfully marketable in any one EU member state must be so in all (subject to limited exceptions, namely health). Furthermore, to protect all member states' markets, the EU's harmo nized food production standards reflect the regulations of the member state with the least stringent quality protections for the item in question. These requirements apply to multi national corporations and small-scale pro ducers alike. Efforts to protect certain foods within this market structure have led to nationally-based contention.3 Such regulations, along with ever-increas ing market integration, have significantly affected the physical production of foodstuffs, generating fears about their "potential to destroy the rich culinary diversity of member states" (MacMaol?in 2007:19). For example, EU hygiene and health standards requiring pasteurization limit the production and sale of certain raw-milk cheeses (West 2008). Cross national obligations to distribute foodstuffs among states also open producers to potentially unfair trading practices and price competition from those with better resources (MacMaol?in 2007). In 1992, recognizing dilemmas created by this system, particularly for small-scale and artisanal food producers with aspirations to sell in national and international markets, the EU instituted a program to register cer tain food and agricultural products as excep tions to CAP. Within this program, producers of "traditional" food products can apply to receive one of three EU-sponsored labels?Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indication (PGI), or Traditional Specialty Guaranteed (TSG)?to designate their products as pos sessing certain unique characteristics, mostly associated with place. These labels aim to protect food products from imitation, their names from misuse, and consumers from potential misrepresentation. Of the 790 labels awarded before December 31, 2007, 57 per cent were PDO, 41 percent were PGI, and only 2 percent were for TSG.4 For PDO and PGI registrations, a product must be linked to a geographical area. The TSG label reflects the use of traditional production methods but does not specify place.5 Claims based on geographical origin have been more desirable than those for produc tion method, supporting the relevance of gas tronationalism. Moreover, these claims give certain producers within certain nations the right to use place names in their marketing, packaging, and presentation. They thus link sets of values and symbols to institutional ized representations of territory and history, and "share the common goal of furthering authenticity" within member states and the EU as a whole (European Commission 2006:5).

These foods are typically marketed and sold as specialty products because of their limited availability (van der Lans et al. 2001). Table 1 provides several examples of these products. From 1992 until January 1994, member states used an abbreviated application proce dure to inform the Commission of foodstuffs they wished to register, with the understanding that designations satisfying the Commission's requirements would be registered. During this period, some countries (e.g., France, Spain, and Germany) submitted many more applica tions than others (e.g., the Netherlands). After January 1994, the registration proce dure intensified, giving early adopters of the program an advantage. The new label registration process, which remains in effect today, requires a group of producers to organize into a consortium, create a specific definition of their product,6 and submit an application to their national agricultural office. The national office then examines the application to ensure compliance with the requirements and chooses whether to forward it to the European Commission's Agricultural and Rural Development Department. If forwarded, the Official Journal of European Communities publishes the request to inform other member states and the general public of the application. External parties have six months to lodge an objection, admissible only (1) if the application is not in full compliance with requirements, (2) if the name is considered generic, or (3) if reg istering the name would jeopardize the exis tence of a similarly named product or trademark. If no objections are made, the European Commission registers and publishes</page><page sequence="8">DeSoucey 439 the newly protected name in the Official Journal of European Communities. It is a mem ber state's responsibility to ensure that its regis tered products comply with official specifications. The 790 products registered before December 31, 2007 (as well as those pending approval) are not distributed evenly among member states. To determine why gastrona tionalism is more pronounced in certain coun tries, I chose several country-level variables to examine national patterns in the configura tion of these labels. Table 2 presents variables corresponding to the 21 countries that have at least one registered food product.7 To identify conditions associated with countries that are high utilizers of the labeling program (i.e., Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Germany), I first calculated the number of labels registered in each country per capita (in millions) and per 10,000 km2 to control for each country's population size and land area (e.g., the difference between Germany and the Netherlands). Population and area show statistically significant correla tions with the number of registered labels (p &lt; .01). Population density within countries, however, is not statistically significant. Portugal, Germany, and Luxembourg have the highest rate of labels per capita and in rela tion to areal extent. Luxembourg's relational numbers are high, however, due to its very small size and population; thus, I do not con sider it equally alongside other member states in calculating low versus high utilizers. After controlling for the size of population and territory, I hypothesized a significant pos itive correlation between number of origin la bels and national reliance on agricultural output, measured by the current value of each country's agricultural contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) (Column 5 in Table 2) and the percentage of each country's population employed in agriculture (Column 6 in Table 2). Neither of these correlations are statistically significant (R = .187 for the pop ulation measure and R = .052 for GDP contri bution). Greece is the only country with both a high per capita measure of registrations and high levels of agricultural GDP contribution and agricultural employment. A large percent age of Portugal's population is involved in agricultural production, but contribution to GDP is low. Other countries with high rates of agricultural contribution to GDP, such as Poland and Hungary, have extremely low rates of registered food origin labels. National reli ance on agricultural output does not correlate with being a high utilizer of the origin labeling program. I then considered whether countries had a program to geographically demarcate agri cultural products before the EU program began. Producers from countries with exist ing designation programs would likely per ceive value in the new pan-national system. Countries with prior appellation programs8 should hypothetically be high utilizers of protected designation labels.9 Indeed, there is a strong positive relation ship between the prior existence of such pro grams and the percentage of total labels registered by high utilizing countries. For the six countries that had appellation infra structure prior to the EU program,10 the mean percentage of total origin labels is 14.63 (SD = 4.88). For countries without such a program, the mean percentage of total origin labels is .86 (SD = .98, t = 10.7, df = 18,/? &lt; .001). A t-test shows statistical sig nificance at &lt; .01. Correlating the exis tence of an infrastructure with a country's number of labels (controlling for population) is also statistically significant (p &lt; .05, R = .502, = 19). Existing programs did provide an entrenched organizational form that helped producer-organized consortia succeed at making use of the EU's program. Do states' leaders view nationally mark ing food items as a means to gather addi tional support for collective identity and self-presentation (e.g., we eat Kalamata olives because we are Greek, and it is part of our identity to do so)?

To consider promotion to internal national audiences, I ranked the number of food-related festivals and food trade shows by country in 2008, as catalogued by FoodReference.com,13 and assigned a 1 to countries that had seven or more festivals that year and .5 to the two countries that had between three and six festivals (Belgium and Ireland).14 To account for the perceived role of external audiences in gener ating national culinary self-consciousness, I ranked the number of books about each coun try's cuisine sold under the "travel/food" category at the U.S.-based Amazon.com. I coded the four countries higher than the aver age (mean = 15.67) as 1, and the seven coun tries that had between 7 and 14 books listed received a .5.15 While these criteria might also be used to measure publishing or tour ism, they do link to ideas about the degree to which culinary cultures are promoted to outsiders. For the third measure, I assigned a 1 to countries that applied to UNESCO in 2008 to include their national food culture (i.e., France) or the Mediterranean Diet (i.e., Spain, Italy, and Greece) on UNESCO's list of cultural heritage sites and patrimonial intangibles. I then assigned a high measure of culinary self-consciousness (see Table 2) to the three countries that scored a 3 on the compendium measure: France, Italy, and Spain, which are three of the six countries with the highest rates of label registrations. The other three countries with high rates of label registrations?Greece, Portugal, and Germany?scored a medium. The Spearman rank-order correlation coeffi cient (a non-parametric measure of as sociation based on the rank-ordering of variables) calculated between culinary self consciousness and the percentage of total ori gin labels by country is .525 (p &lt; .05, = 20), indicative of a strong positive relationship between the two. Controlling for a country's number of labels per capita, however, negates the measure's statistical significance, indicat ing either that the measure is not highly corre lated to label registrations or that national interest in food and cuisine is not dependent on population numbers. If considering the first explanation, re gressing these three variables (i.e., agricul ture, appellation, and culinary self consciousness per capita) against a country's number of labels per capita shows, indeed, that only preexisting appellation infrastruc ture is statistically significant (? = 4.879, &lt; .05). If considering the second, the nom inal variables of previous appellation and culinary self-consciousness are individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for countries to be high utilizers of gastrona tionalist claims (Mahoney 2000). If a neces sary condition is present, the outcome could be either present or absent. Yet, the two var iables are jointly sufficient, so a present suf ficient variable (?rom either column) means the outcome (high utilization) will be pres ent. Countries with appellation infrastruc tures and/or high or medium levels of culinary self-consciousness will thus have significantly higher levels of protective ori gin labels institutionalized through the EU program, and they will be more likely to advance gastronationalist claims. Few origin label applications are unsuc cessful (personal communication, Antonella Famararo, DG Agriculture Office), but some can be. For example, although Italian law pre viously enforced domestic standards for pro duction of pasta (as made exclusively from durum wheat), Italy was unable to register it.</page><page sequence="11">442 American Sociological Review 75(3) Even though many consumers consider pasta to have Italian origins, production had dif fused too widely and its "generic" name pre vented it from receiving a label. Italy was successful, however, in registering "pizza Napoletana" as a TSG in April 2008, after 14 years of legal wrangling (Article 8(2) of Regulation 509/2006). The registration speci fies, among other details, the hours required for leavening the dough, as well as its required height, baking temperature, and seasonings (but not the place of production).16 Claims for the protection of particular food stuffs as nationally significant help us under stand the revitalization of practices or items considered traditional during times when old identities are perceived to be in jeopardy (Calhoun 1993; Cavanaugh 2004; Hobsbawm and Ranger 1983). Gastronationalism is exclu sionary in this regard because it prohibits others from making similar food claims, either materi ally or symbolically. The European Court of Justice resolves competing national interests. For example, in February 2008, the Court ruled that only cheeses bearing the PDO "Parmigiano-Reggiano"17 can be sold as "Parmesan" cheese in European member states outside of Italy. This ruling followed three years of infringement proceedings brought by the Consorzio di Parmigiano Reggiano and the European Commission against Germany for marketing its own version of "Parmesan" and not sufficiently protecting the Italian PDO in its market. Another important case?often cited by food law scholars?is a 10-year legal dispute between Greece and other member states over feta cheese. Greek feta production has been codified in increasingly specific terms since 1935 (Dalby 1996); it was awarded a PDO label in the first official list of regis tered products (Regulation 1107/1996). In 1999, Denmark and Germany, supported by the United Kingdom and France, contested the label, raising three key issues concerning feta's status as Greek. First, they argued that the name "feta" contains no geographic place name and actually derives from an Italian word. Second, the geographic area that Greece submitted in its application en compasses a variety of climate conditions shared by other European nations. Third, and perhaps most important to the European Commission's decision to annul Greece's PDO (Regulation 1070/1999), they argued that the name had become generic and was therefore ineligible for protection (Evans and Blakeney 2006).18 Revisiting the issue in 2002, the Commission reversed its ruling and rein stated the registration of feta as a Greek PDO (Regulation 1829/2002). The Court upheld its ruling after an appeal from Denmark and Germany, noting in its brief that 85 percent of production and 80 percent of consumption occurred in Greece, and that feta cheese produced in Denmark and Germany often referred to Greece with words, pictures, or color schemes on its pack aging. Non-Greek cheese-makers lost the right to use the name "feta" within the EU at the end of 2007 (Evans and Blakeney 2006), but they may still sell their cheeses as "feta" outside the EU (e.g., when ex ported to the United States). These cases show how the EU program con fers on foods (and their producers) the legal right to draw national boundaries in an other wise open marketplace. The labels are often promoted as improving farmers' incomes, sup port and resources for rural communities, and retention of rural populations?and in many cases, they do. More importantly, gastrona tional claims about the significance of tradition and authenticity, as invoked in the organiza tional work of registering an origin label, high light the nationalized revaluation of food producers who might otherwise disappear in a competitive pan-national climate. The Case of French Foie Gras Politics Beyond international implications, gastrona tionalism as a construct possesses important</page><page sequence="12">DeSoucey 443 micro-level complexities, namely its use in defensive claimsmaking for a particular food within a nation, and institutional strategies at the level of lived experience. As a case of gas tronationalism, foie gras differs from pro tected foods like feta cheese or proscuitto di Parma because organizations in the United States and many EU countries want its produc tion to cease altogether.19 Animal rights groups argue that foie gras's production meth ods are cruel and immoral. Foie gras produc tion in Europe is regulated by the European Union Commission on Animal Health and Welfare, but many EU member states have outlawed its production within their borders. Its marketing and consumption cannot be banned, however, due to CAP's principle of mutual recognition (Article 28 EC).20 Foie gras is the fattened liver of a duck or goose. It is produced through a process known as gavage, which requires a person to use a tube to manually feed the duck or goose two or three times a day in the last 12 to 20 days of the bird's life. Long valued as a specialty dish, foie gras was first depicted in Egyptian bas-reliefs from 2500 BC and documented in Roman agricul tural treatises (Serventi 2002; Toussaint Samat 1994). Historical texts attribute its prev alence in France to the Romans in Gaul (south western France) and to Jewish populations in northeast France, who raised geese for their kosher cooking fat. The French gastronomic foie gras tradition has roots in early culinary texts such as La Varenne's Le Cuisinier Fran?ois, published in 1651, and the menus of seventeenth-century royal banquets (Gu?rard 1998). By the 1800s, goose foie gras had become an integral part of the emergent field of French gastronomy and an international status symbol of luxury and elegance (Ginor 1999). Today, foie gras is ubiquitous in France. As of 2006, around 80 percent of world foie gras production and 90 percent of world consumption occur there, where it is a $2.5 billion industry. According to Comit? Interprofessionnel des Palmip?des du Foie Gras (CIFOG), the French foie gras industry encompasses approximately 15,000 farms and 600 processing facilities, ranging from small family-run businesses to large-scale operations. The industry employs about 30,000 people, including many part-time and seasonal workers, and it indirectly af fects about 100,000 jobs (e.g., veterinary practices, business, marketing, distribution, and tourism). Throughout the country, menus abound with foie gras dishes. Specialty foie gras shops are part of urban streetscapes, and foie gras is sold at most outdoor markets, specialty grocery stores, large supermarkets, chain stores, and, in the Southwest, even at gas station convenience stores. The conditions of French foie gras pro duction and consumption are, in fact, recent phenomena. Rates of foie gras production and consumption within France have tripled since the 1970s, due in large part to state sup port (through the National Institute for Agricultural Research [INRA]) for new tech nologies that lowered production costs (Jullien and Smith 2008). In the 1980s, the introduction of pneumatic, hydraulic, and computer-calibrated feeding systems allowed each duck to be fed in several seconds, rather than the 30- to 60-second feeding required for artisanal production.21 Additionally, the industry-wide switch in the 1970s to making foie gras from ducks (which are considered heartier and easier to keep in industrial farm facilities) instead of geese made foie gras less expensive and thus available to a wider range of consumers. In interviews, industry members referred to these processes as "the democratization of foie gras." French government directives concerning foie gras production emerged only within the past few decades, concurrent with ex panding EU political and market integration. In 1993, the French government issued regu latory guidelines that created specific defini tions for different foie gras products. In 1998, an EU Council Directive codified guidelines for the welfare of all animals kept for agri cultural purposes in Europe. The 93-page document specific to foie gras production</page><page sequence="13">444 American Sociological Review 75(3) defines animal welfare measurements and includes recommendations to improve pro duction conditions (Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare 1998).22 In response to an inquiry posed by a member of the European Parliament, the Council stressed that "it should be men tioned that a ban on force-feeding is neither foreseen by the Directive nor by the re commendations mentioned" (European Commission 2001). Around the same time these recom mendations were released, in early 1999, the French government applied for and received the EU PGI label "Canard ? foie gras du Sud-Ouest."23 The application was criticized not by animal rights groups, but by small scale, artisanal foie gras producers for its lack of specificity concerning the size of pro duction operations and particular quality measures for the resulting products. These producers' claims indicated fears that tradi tional, small-scale farms would be put in eco nomic jeopardy by industrial producers (T?choueyres 2007). National agricultural authorities, however, were invested in having the EU designate foie gras a French food. The French national office and the European Commission accepted the application, allow ing producers of any size in Southwestern France to obtain the PGI label. Throughout this period, France faced mounting international criticism of foie gras production from animal rights organiza tions.24 Protests and vandalism in Britain tar geted department stores and restaurants that sold foie gras, and legislators across the United States considered prohibitions. A small but vocal animal rights group within France, Stop Gavage, began to get media attention and to draw support from interna tional animal rights groups.25 In October 2005, legislators in the French National Assembly and Senate voted by large majorities to declare foie gras part of the "officially-protected cultural and gas tronomic patrimony of France" (Loi d'orientation agricole n? 2341, article L654 27-1 du code rural). The Assembly's deputies provided an accompaniment to the amend ment, which proclaimed that "foie gras is an emblematic element of our gastronomy and our culture." The amendment noted that the product "perfectly fulfills criteria" defining national patrimony "and the link to terroir that characterizes the originality of the French food model." Testimony by Senate legislators suggests that the declara tion was made "anticipating any initiative from Brussels [the EU's headquarters]." In response to a senator's statement that the "advertisement of foie gras in law" by national endorsement seemed unnecessary, another responded that "it is because gavage is contested that it is necessary to inscribe it in law; otherwise, the good spirits of Brussels will come and ban from us all that is our terroir." As this exchange indicates, gastronation alism's targets necessarily include national and international audiences in linking moral, patriotic, and market actions as one and the same. Perceptions of ideological differences rendered national boundary maintenance strategies around foie gras necessary within the pan-national enterprise; ideas about inter national condemnation galvanized this gas tronationalist claim for institutionalized protection of national cultural patrimony. Even the head of Stop Gavage understands the uphill battle his group faces. When I asked him why he believes France decided to protect foie gras, he responded: There is a recent polarization on foie gras?it is the patrimony. It is the identity of France. It's like wine from Bordeaux. Development of foie gras production is within the last 60 years, more or less. It was there, but very weak before, there was little consumption, not all that wide spread. So, the foie gras industry had a lot of work to do on the image of foie gras as something from the Southwest</page><page sequence="14">DeSoucey 445 and, later, as being part of the image of France, like the Eiffel Tower. His response illustrates how state-market re lationships use the concept and tools of cul ture, even when the object in question is morally problematic. Naturalizing and Historicizing National Tradition Perceptions of a country's history influence which objects are incorporated into cultural identity narratives (Hobsbawm and Ranger 1983; Scares 1997), and these perceptions necessarily respond to internal and external forces. My interviews and conversations with people at all levels of the French foie gras industry were replete with claims and stories that relied heavily on the concepts of nature, history, and tradition in order to link foie gras to contemporary French national interests and self-identity. Conceptual uses of nature, as L?vi-Strauss (1969) has taught us, are culturally embed ded phenomena, and distinctions between nature and culture are the products of ideo logical choices. Throughout my interviews and review of secondary sources, I found the explanation that foie gras production mimics or exploits a "natural process" (i.e., waterfowl store fat in the liver for migration). Informants frequently invoked this claim in response to questions regarding current criticism, to challenge accusations that production imposed "unnaturalness" on the birds, or to explain the use of ducks and geese instead of other birds or animals (see also Heath and Meneley 2007). These narratives also connect origin and discovery stories of foie gras production in Egyptian and Roman civilizations to its current prom inent position in French culinary culture, ex tending the "greatness" of past civilizations to the present (Dalby 2003; Ginor 1999; Serventi 2002). Moreover, linking nature and the physical landscape with "authentic" products draws attention to the materiality of gastronational ism. In contrast to environmental and eco logical discourses that emerged out of nineteenth-century romanticism, which present nature as either a Utopian paradise or a threatening wilderness outside the bounds of human society (Heller 1999), the French vision of "nature" is predicated on notions of social rural life. According to French sociologist Claude Fischler (1990), these include the terroir and savoir-faire that produce the wine, cheese, and p?t?s that are emblematic of French cultural history. Foie gras is historicized as part of social rural life by invoking familial tradition. Several of the small-scale farms I visited send someone to drive around France once or twice each year to make deliveries to long-time clients and friends. Interviewees frequently mentioned their grandmothers as influential in their conceptions of foie gras's traditional Frenchness (similar to folk understandings of the cowboy in North American cattle production [Blue 2008]).27 Until the advent of industrialized foie gras production, it was typically the job of elder female family members to raise poultry and other small animals for house hold consumption. For some country fami lies, this role continues: Bonne-maman, at age 75, still raises and feeds about 20 to 30 birds each November for the winter holidays for her children's families. She tells me that she's done this all her life and learned the practice from her grandmother. She uses the old-fash ioned gavage tool, where she sits on a chair or stool and, while wearing a skirt, holds the bird between her legs to feed it. She soaks the corn kernels in water to soften them for the feed. She also showed me her vegetable garden and several rabbits she keeps for food, (fieldnotes) These narratives connect the social realms of family, civil society, and the market to</page><page sequence="15">446 American Sociological Review 75(3) naturalize and ennoble foie gras's Frenchness within local and national communities. Campaigns created and heavily marketed by local governments and chambers of com merce to encourage regional tourism within France also characterize foie gras as indicative of French national identity. While tourism has long been critiqued for oversimplifying the subtle variations of cultures and for physically manipulating places to create an air of authen ticity for visitors (MacCannell 1973), the exis tence of an organizational infrastructure for tourism indicates institutional values assigned to a place or culture, whether or not these val ues are ideologically charged or in flux (Gotham 2007). Entire towns and regions within France use foie gras production and consumption as draws for tourism. Sarlat-le-Can?da, a well-preserved medieval town in P?rigord, is a foie gras Disneyland. Every restaurant in the city center, including a pizzeria, adver tises foie gras dishes. Storefronts are packed with duck and goose products and related knick-knacks. In the town's central plaza, tourists often take photographs with the bronze statue of three geese, which was donated in 1875 by Rougi?, currently France's largest foie gras producer. Signs for foie gras farms and their attached shops, sometimes hand-drawn to evoke rustic charm, dot the southwestern French countryside.26 These signs often pre sent images of smiling ducks wearing bow ties or playing musical instruments. Visitors can eat at restaurants located on these small, picturesque farms or stay overnight in inex pensive guest rooms. March?s du gras (fat markets) are another draw in these regions for tourists and locals alike. Every week dur ing the winter, people can purchase duck and goose carcasses and livers directly from pro ducers at these markets. These are not regular farmers markets; the only things sold are raw carcasses and livers. I watched several hun dred people line up at a November march? du gras in the town of Gimont, anxious for the market's controller to blow the 10 a.m. Start whistle; they stampeded to the tables, shopping baskets in hand, once he did. The Southwestern departments' govern ment-sponsored tourist offices have also spurred the development of the "foie gras weekend." Organized and promoted with support from the national agricultural office, visitors can spend a night on a working foie gras farm, where the main activity is cutting up and cooking your own duck or goose to bring home, with instruction from the farm's proprietor. According to my interviews with local government and tourism officials, the goals of these programs are to acquaint French people and foreigners with the people engaged in foie gras production, to increase consumption, and to "prove" to visitors foie gras's national cultural value. National Solidarity and Cultural Boundaries Gastronationalism must appeal to an immedi ate level of collective identity that recognizes boundaries between insiders and outsiders. One potential informant, a professor, told our intermediary she would meet with me only if I "enjoyed eating foie gras." When I asked her why she had solicited this infor mation, she responded: Because you came with the category of American. And, some Americans are against the production of foie gras. So, I didn't want to invite one of them, because I didn't want to meet someone who doesn't like foie gras. It's a question of national sol idarity. I don't think I am especially nation alist, but in this context, I defend it. When asked about bans and critiques out side of France, rather than defending foie gras production as not cruel, almost all inter viewees responded by valorizing it as an authentic French food and connecting it to a perceived sense of belonging based on national tradition. For example, the president</page><page sequence="16">DeSoucey_447 of CIFOG and CEO of Feyel-Artzner (a Strasbourg-based foie gras company) ex plained (in English): I cannot imagine that foie gras could be banned in France because it's a very tradi tional product, consumed in this country for a long time. Our country and our law say that our product is a traditional product that has to be protected. It's by law. Mainly people like it as a gastronomic product. But, they buy it also because it's a ritual. You have to. It's exactly the same as in your country, at Thanksgiving you have to have your turkey. There is no Thanksgiving without turkey. And, we have no Christmas without foie gras. It's a ritual in our country. You have to do it. Similar to the role played by the Thanksgiving turkey in bringing American families together for a ritualized meal, the work of cultivating French national taste for foie gras steeps it in cultural notions of tradi tion. One visitor to a gastronomic food exposi tion in Paris told me (in English), "If you try to beat the foie gras traditions, you're going to beat the traditions of Christmas for us. I am 35 years old, and have had foie gras at every holiday." Legal protections, however, around foie gras in France and turkey in the United States differ. Although it is possible that tur key production will one day be a cornerstone of international contentious politics for animal rights movements, it is not currently so, nor has the U.S. government offered special legal recognition and protection to its production. Embedding foie gras in French law politicizes it as central to France's self-identity as a leader in both culinary culture and resisting global market forces. While somewhat of an exceptional case of gastronationalism, foie gras offers a unique lens into the work of maintaining national boundaries within a pan-national system. The 2005 legislative protection of foie gras reflects and emboldens the use of cultural narratives of tradition and national defense within foie gras's social and material worlds. Producers and state representatives recognize foie gras as something dear to them placed in potential jeopardy by external forces. Foie gras has come to represent and demarcate French national patrimony, at least in part, because it is morally contentious elsewhere. Today, preserving foie gras is a small but sig nificant way for the French to defend the idea of France. CONCLUSIONS Block and Somers's (2005) concept of "idea tional embeddedness" describes how ideas have power in shaping market-based regimes. While they apply this concept to the transfor mation of state-sponsored welfare regimes into more market-driven entities, their atten tion toward the coupling of economic princi ples with the power of ideas provides a template for considering how states and industries use culture to legitimate and protect their markets. Yet, policy discourses around the globe about the protection of culture in the face of homogenizing markets reveal how cultural exceptions problematize policies that promote cross-national cooperation. Gastronationalism is an important claims making device for sociologists to consider in this regard. While some may interpret such policies as simply protecting material inter ests, the data presented here demonstrate that gastronationalism's contentiousness cre ates a means of cultural and national differ entiation. Although it remains politically rooted and shaped by markets, gastronation alism elucidates patterns of, and claims for, exceptionalism based on notions of cultural tradition and patrimony. It strategically weds considerations of national identity to the idea of the nation as a protector of cul tural patrimony, as demonstrated by Tables 1 and 2. Nationalist layering of marketing and myth-making in contentious food politics further suggests that food itself contributes to national claims of significant qualitative</page><page sequence="17">448 American Sociological Review 75(3) differences and to the power dynamics of national identity politics. The case of foie gras permits deeper scru tiny of gastronationalism's ideological com ponents in protectionist policies and the theoretical significance of institutionalized cultural resistance to globalism. Foie gras politics are not simply a national peculiarity, but a manifestation of national cultural iden tity that deliberately addresses foie gras's, and thus France's, standing in the EU. External claims about the morality of animal welfare are countered with claims about the salient roles played by history and traditions in supporting contemporary cultural identity and uniqueness. Gastronationalism buttresses national identity against perceived threats from outsiders who wish to eliminate certain objects or practices. This adds an important layer to gastronationalism's role in creating cultural market and political protections. For France, gastronationalism is central to bolstering national self-identification. Cuisine continues to be one of the most universally rec ognized components of French culture, and one of France's greatest sources of domestic and international pride (Pitte 2002; Shields Argeles 2004; Trubek 2008). French cuisine's institutional threads reach from the Guide Michelin system of restaurant ratings, which centralized symbolic power in the culinary field (Hansen 2008), to the Meilleur Ouvrier de France, a coveted award within the culinary profession that, since 1924, gives winners the right to wear the French flag's colors on their collars (Fantasia forthcoming). As Meunier (2000:107) writes, "by painting globalization as a direct attack on French food, its opponents receive national approbation for a collective struggle against la mal-bouffe, or 'lousy food.'" State-based gastronational strategies have reverberated nationally. In 1989, the French Ministry of Culture created the Conseil National des Arts Culinaires (National Council of Culinary Arts), with the mission of protecting French gastronomy by teaching about the national palate. Its activities include a taste education program for children and an official inventory of the culi nary patrimony of each French region. Gastronomic expositions are held throughout France (financed by city governments) to expose people to foods from different regions. The Salon Saveurs in Paris, for example, is a biannual three-day affair that hosts 250 to 300 artisan producers of various food products (including many with PDO and PGI labels, and 20 to 25 foie gras booths) and 25,000 visitors. These expositions are important sales and net working resources, allowing small- and medium-sized food producers to circumvent large distribution channels and build national awareness of their products. Conceptually, the construct of cuisine em phasizes the development of specific tech niques and celebrates chefs who possess those techniques (Ferguson 2004; Trubek 2000). This makes cuisine portable across space and time.28 For example, celebrated French chefs made New York City a mecca for haute cuisine restaurants in the late-nine teenth century (Kuh 2001), and today ac claimed chefs from Europe and the United States, such as Alain Ducasse and Daniel Boulud, are opening restaurants in Japan and China. Gastronationalism, on the other hand, focuses on the institutionalized protection and promotion of certain food items as grounded in their place of production. The concept of an origin designation for a food product incor porates the unique material roles of soil, cli mate, and the specialized knowledge that accompanies generations of food producers tied to a particular locale; it is the materiality of the food ingredient in its raw form that is val ued. By using food as a material vehicle of national identity, gastronationalism meshes the power and resources of cultural, political, and economic identities as they shape and are shaped by institutional protections. Gastronationalism is confined neither to high-utilizing countries nor to Europe, espe cially as issues of food safety and producers' economic viability receive media attention and public scrutiny. Geographic labeling</page><page sequence="18">DeSoucey 449 programs for food and consumer products are becoming widespread across the globe (Evans and Blakeney 2006), and they serve as strategic assets for producers who wish to manage their identity and differentiate themselves from others (Lounsbury and Glynn 2001). For example, the oriGIn project (Organisation for an International Geographical Indications Network), a Swiss based nongovernmental organization repre senting 85 groups from more than 30 countries, began advocating in 2003 for more legal protections for geographic indicators at transnational levels. The group's membership currently includes such diverse products as Bolivian Quinua Real de Lipez, Guatemalan Caf? de Antigua, Indian Basmati rice, Kenyan tea, Idaho potatoes, and Mexican tequila. International private organizations, such as Slow Food, provide similar institutional support and recognition for foods and food producers they consider "authentic." Slow Food (which originated in Italy and has con sortia across the globe, including an active presence in the United States) prides itself on preserving and promoting artisanal food items and traditional production practices considered "near extinction" due to global impacts of agribusiness (Andrews 2008; Chrzan 2004). These public and private organizational forms tell a story that distinguishes gastrona tionalism from a simple dichotomy of tradi tion versus progress. These organizations oppose homogenizing forces in principle, yet they rely on such forces to differentiate themselves when promoting multiple localisms?what Slow Food calls "virtuous globalization." Furthermore, without valua tion and purchase by wealthier consumers (as Slow Food argues), some food traditions would be economically unsustainable and disappear, making this type of globalism more palatable for anti-globalization adher ents. Such strategies, however, must remain cognizant of their potential to promote a romanticized past that ignores the travails of peasants, farmers, and the poor, what Laudan (2004) calls "culinary Luddism." Gastronationalism is part of a broader identity project unfolding across Europe and the world that is responding to potential losses of control of production and national industries, accelerated by global moves toward open trade (Barber 1996; Dobbin et al. 2007; Steger 2002). In terms of public attentiveness, gastronationalism ties to, and potentially substitutes for, attention paid to other changes accompanying pan-national integration politics, such as income in equality (Beckfield 2006), the welfare state (Brady, Seeleib-Kaiser, and Beckfield 2005), and new waves of migrants escaping poverty and political persecution (Gingrich and Banks 2006). In this regard, gastrona tionalism could be considered part of the same response to globalism that has given rise to xenophobic nationalist organizations (Taras 2009). Combining the work and resources of food industries with national interests demonstrates the importance of considering contentious micro-cultural politics in the study of multi state systems. This project endorses economic sociologists' growing interest in meaning making within market-state systems. Engagement with meanings and materials associated with a rapidly receding past sit uates, and even creates, these present-day forms of institutionalized protections. Gastronationalism is a critical concept for so ciologists: it reflects and refracts social condi tions under which market-based identities engage with national boundaries, the public recognition of difference, and the importance of community. Its myriad consequences for consumers, interest groups, industries, and policymakers, however, remain to be seen.

I use "gastronationalism" as coined by Swart (2000, 2002) in two regional conference presentations. No published articles came out of this work. The term gastronationalism has also been used, according to Cassell's Dictionary of Slang (Green 2005), to differ entiate national identities through insults based on food preferences. For example, arguments between the United Kingdom and France over British beef (and the fear of mad cow disease), after France ille gally maintained a ban on imports that the rest of the EU had lifted three years earlier, led to the increased use of "rosbif to denote a British person, parallel to the way "frog" has been used to insult the French. 2. Accessed via EUR-Lex, which provides free access to the Official Journal of the European Union. 3. For example, a 3 0-year battle over the production and marketing of chocolate began when Britain joined the EU in 1973; the dispute ended with a 2003 ruling by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. Eight EU member states (in particular Spain and Italy) ob jected to and restricted the distribution and marketing of British chocolate within their borders, because British chocolate is made with up to 5 percent vege table fat instead of pure cocoa butter. These objec tions were overruled and the restrictions deemed illegal under the principle of mutual recognition, entitling British chocolate products open access to all EU markets (Cidell and Alberts 2006). 4. It was not until August 1996 that the first TSG reg istration application (for Italian mozzarella cheese) was published in the Official Journal. Other TSG labels are primarily concentrated in Belgium (for beer) and Sweden and Finland (for processed food products, such as pies). 5. Since the end of 2007, when my sampling ends, several applications have been approved, several hundred more are under review, and some have been backlogged for more than two years. The full list of registered products, searchable by prod uct type or country, is available at http://ec.europa .eu/agriculture/quality/database/index_en.htm. 6. For example, according to the definition set by the producers' consortium, to attain the PDO label for proscuitto di Parma, or Parma ham, the meat must be sliced and packaged in the region of production. This proved controversial; the consortium brought a suit against a UK grocer and a distributor for slic ing the meat themselves and selling it without the official brand mark on the product or packaging (see Salumificio v. Asda Stores Ltd &amp; Hygrade Foods Ltd [European Court of Justice 2003]). 7. Timing of approval does not reflect nationally spe cific processes or events. The Commission did not release a list of the first 320 designation labels until June 1996, due to large amounts of paperwork and the fact that many applications required additional information. Subsequent registrations have simi larly been released in groups. 8. For example, Appellation d'Origine Contr?l?e in France, Qualit?tatswein mit Pr?dikat and Qualit?tatswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete in Germany, Denomina?ao de Origem Controlada in Portugal, and Denominaci?n de Origen in Spain. 9. Examples of prior multilateral agreements are the Madrid Agreement of 1891, which included policies for handling false or deceptive indications of a good's source, and the Lisbon Agreement of 1958, which specified protections for appellations of origin and their international registration. 10. Most of these appellation programs were created for wine production (Stanziani 2004). Hungary intro duced the world's first vineyard classification system in 1730, based on sun exposure, soil quality, and poten tial to develop fungus. My measure counts only appel lation systems that came into existence after the development of the modem European state system. 11. Measuring the importance of food culture to a coun try is a tricky conceptual task; few countries have poor opinions of their food cultures. With unlimited time and expert resources, one could tally the num ber of food scenes or references in each nation's lit erature or film, or comb archives of all 21 national newspapers for articles related to food. 12. I considered but did not include in my metric other potential boundary-drawing identifiers that could reveal the extent to which culinary self-conscious ness is a product of tying national culture to percep tions of external threats (Erikson 1966). These include, but are not limited to, issues of ethnic, reli gious, and linguistic diversity and immigration pat terns, which are beyond the scope of this analysis. 13. Foodreference.com is a food news and information Web site that receives about one million page views per month and claims to host the most complete worldwide listing of food festivals. 14. At the low end, several countries listed no festivals; at the high end, Britain had 52. The mean number of festivals by country is 6.3 per year. 15. Italy, at 98, had the highest number of books listed. 16. This label has already produced paradoxical results. Non-Italians recently won the World Pizza Championships; they produced "authentic" pizza Napoletana by following the ingredient list and des ignation rules (Helstosky 2008). This demonstrates one reason why TSGs are less sought after protec tions than PDO or PGI labels.</page><page sequence="20">DeSoucey 451 17. Parmigiano-Reggiano is a slow-maturing cheese made in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy. There are just over 400 cheese production houses in the region, which produce about 3 million cheeses annually. Some mechanization is used in the process (e.g., mechanical arms turn the cheese wheels), but it is still considered artisanal. A 1934 decree by the Italian government created the Consorzio di Parmigiano-Reggiano (for further information, see de Roest and Menghi [2000]). 18. The Greek government responded unsuccessfully that the "feta" produced outside of Greece was manufactured incorrectly because it used cow milk instead of sheep and goat milk. 19. Israel, one of the larger foie gras producers outside of France in the 1990s, banned its production in 2002 through a 2 to 1 Supreme Court decision. The Israeli Supreme Court applied existing anticru elty laws to the force-feeding of birds. California, one of only two states in the United States that pro duces foie gras, passed a production ban in 2004 that will go into effect in 2012. The city of Chicago passed a distribution ban for restaurants in April 2006, which was repealed in May 2008. Several other U.S. cities and states have considered ordinances similar to the Chicago ban, but none have enacted one. 20. Many EU countries with production bans were never foie gras producers; this legislation was mainly symbolic. Foie gras production in Europe is permitted only in France, Spain, Belgium, Hungary, and Bulgaria?nations designated in EU documents as "traditional zones" of production. 21. Until they are brought into gavage, the ducks and geese are not confined to pens. During gavage, they are kept in either pens or individual cages (by EU de cree, the use of cages will be eliminated in France by 2015). Pens and cages prevent the birds from burning energy, so they fatten more easily. This process is sim ilar to confinement practices used in raising most farm animals eaten today (Pollan 2006). 22. While many animal rights groups use this document to support their claims, it does not actually condemn the practice of force-feeding. Instead, it suggests limiting production to where it was a "current prac tice," eliminating individual cages, and continuing "scientific study" regarding animal welfare stand ards and alternative methods of production. 23. This region currently produces about 50 percent of duck foie gras made in France. 24. Animal rights organizations position foie gras as a touchstone in debates over farm animal welfare. French producers are well-aware of recent critiques that equate their work with animal suffering, and they insist on their commitment to tradition and to their animals' well-being. When asked about inter national criticism, many respondents suggested that anthropomorphism led people to misunderstand and denigrate the process. Several noted the dispro portionate level of outrage regarding foie gras rela tive to other problems facing animals and people alike. One chef I interviewed in Bordeaux went on a tirade about other countries, especially the United States, caring about ducks when they "don't demonstrate caring about people." I pressed him, saying that foie gras has opponents within France, too. He immediately responded, "Yes, but America doesn't have a monopoly on imbeciles. There are assholes in every country." 25. Chefs and producers I interviewed were dismissive of Stop Gavage, asserting that foie gras is a decid edly French food and a national tradition. 26. The foie gras farms that welcome tourists account for only about 10 percent of France's total annual foie gras production. The majority of foie gras ducks are raised and processed in larger, more industrial facilities. 27. Notably, the root of the term "patrimony" is patri-, or father, connoting a gendered relationship to cul tural heritage. The nostalgic past evoked by the case of foie gras includes the role of female family mem bers (namely, grandmothers) in national patrimony. 28. I thank one of ASR's anonymous reviewers for pointing to this important difference between cui sine and individual foods. References Ahearne, Jeremy. 2003.

Michaela DeSoucey is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Sociology at Northwestern University. Her work uses food as a lens to examine markets as moral, cultural, and political projects. Her dissertation, Gullet Politics, explores the controversies surrounding foie gras in the United States and France and develops a model of movement-market-state systems as they work to shape the ecology of social problem construc tion and moral claimsmaking around consumption prac tices. In fall 2010, she will begin a postdoctoral fellowship at the Center for the Study of Social Organization at Princeton University.</page></plain_text>
