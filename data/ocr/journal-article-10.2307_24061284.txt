<plain_text><page sequence="1">On aggression. Konrad Lorenz. Methuen and Co. Ltd., London. Price in U.K.: 30 shillings. It s a little difficult to decide what audience this book has been written for. Perhaps to bring closer together the Three Culturesâ€”that of the student of animal behaviour, the student of human behaviour and the Intellectual who doesn't know too much about either of the two others. It's certainly unlikely to tell the ethologist very much he doesn't know already; and, however desirable it may be for the Average Man to understand the animal origin of much of his behaviour and to understand some aspects of animal behaviour anyhow, he's going to find the first half of the book pretty hard going. I'm not the only one who has thought that "The phylogenetic process of ritualisation creates a new autonomous instinct which interferes as an independent force in the great constitution of all other instinctive motivations" is a rather daunting way to begin a chapter of a book not aimed primarily at specialists. This is the sort of jargon that is absent in Elton's at least equally profound book. The heavy handedness may, of course, be the translator's and not Lorenz's. It certainly did not appear in his early and remarkable book, King Solomon's Ring, but at that stage the scientist had not turned moralist. I suppose if the psychoanalyst and the intellectual learn something about the role of aggression in natural selection and some other facts about animal behaviour and their human parallels this will be worthwhile. And drawings. for those who've read about the subject before, there's often something new or interesting in the book. But there'll be many reasonable ethologists (or near ethologists) who will think that to describe a fox as having "a disgusted expression on his face" is being just a little too anthropomorphic. There will be others who may think that the statement that the dingo eliminated Tasmanian devils and -tigers on the Australian mainland by competing with them successfully for food is by no means the incontrovertible fact it is made out to be, and so on. No reasonable person will disagree with the exhorta tion in the book's final paragraph that "love and friend ship should embrace all humanity, that we should love all our human brothers indiscriminately" (we've heard all that before), but it's a little disturbing in the same paragraph to read that "the bond of personal love and friendship was the epoch-making invention created by the great constructors". Where is Lorenz heading? A little further along this road to mystical union of ethology with morality and the "great constructors" will be spelt with capital initials. I wonder whether Aldous Huxley would have written the foreword in stead of his brother, had he been available. The dust jacket says there are "16 half-tone plates and 6 line drawings in the text". All I could find in the copies of On aggression I examined were 5 line G.R.W.</page></plain_text>
