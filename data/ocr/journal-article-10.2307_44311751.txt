<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLE THE METAPHOR THAT WILL NOT PERISH: "THE DREAM OF THE ROOD" AND THE NEW HERMENEUTIC By John Mark Jones, University of South Carolina "The Dream of the Rood" is a unique literary creation in giving poetic expression to theological matter. Almost fifty years ago Margaret Schlauch extolled the poem by saying, "to endow the Cross with the power of locution was to use a device of unexampled effectiveness in making visual an event about which, for all devout Christians, the entire history of the world revolved."1 The cross uses language to describe its identity and purpose, both of which undergo radical revision when the Master of mankind enters the world and transforms the cross from a torturous tool of death to the sacred intermediary of life. The cross's change of purpose and identity produces an inversion of world-order, which is achieved by means of what Paul Ricoeur calls the "metaphoric discourse of poetry."2 Examined in the light of new literary-theological hermeneutics propounded by such critics as Ricoeur, Dan Via and John Crossan, "The Dream of the Rood" may be viewed as a metaphoric discourse which adduces a metaphor that says something new about the world. Ricoeur has suggested that the efficacy of metaphor to express meaning is derived from its singular capacity to create solidarity between two objects that formerly were quite distant from each other, due to their striking thematic or characteristic dissonance. Defining the role of metaphor in art, he says, What is at stake in a metaphorical statement is making a 'kinship' appear where ordinary vision perceives no mutual appropriateness at all. Here metaphor operates in a way which is very close to what Gilbert Ryle has called a 'category mistake.' It is a calculated error. It consists in assimilating things which do not go together. But</page><page sequence="2">64 CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE precisely by means of this calculated error, metaphor discloses a relationship of meaning hitherto unnoticed between terms which were prevented from communicating by former classifications.3 The purpose of metaphor is not simply to create solidarity between two formerly disparate objects, but to construct a new world of meaning through the juxtapositon of the two objects. Metaphor, then, has "the power of redefining reality. ... In short, metaphor says something new about reality,"4 says Ricoeur. Norman Perrin, following the lead of Ricoeur, expresses a similar understanding of metaphor, arguing that it "contrasts two fundamentally different categories of reality and hence produces a shock to the imagination. It produces a shock which induces a new vision of world. . . ."5 John Crossan, who has encouraged Biblical exegetes to view some New Testament parables as metaphors, has said, "a parable is a story whose artistic surface structure allows its deep structure to invade one's hearing in direct contradiction to the deep structure of one's expectation. It is an attack on the world, a raid on the articulate."*Â» Crossan's definition of parable is closely akin to Ricoeur's definition of metaphor, in that both parable and metaphor startle the reader (or hearer) with the strangeness of something new. Ricoeur, Perrin and Crossan, though perhaps varying slightly in their respective understandings of metaphor, nevertheless agree that metaphor creates newness of meaning, or newness of world- vision. Crossan has stressed the importance of the reader's entering the new world created by metaphor in order to understand, or to participate in the new world. The metaphor is the vehicle which permits the reader entry into the new world: metaphor can . . . articulate a referent so new or so alien to consciousness that this referent can only be grasped within the metaphor itself. The metaphor here contains a new possibility of world and of language so that any information one might obtain from it can only be received after one has participated through the metaphor in its new and alien referential world.7 Crossan says the new worlds proposed by New Testament metaphoric parables always disclose some information about the most alien of all worlds, the Kingdom of God. In fact, revelation of the divine is achieved explicitly through metaphor: "The</page><page sequence="3">THE METAPHOR THAT WILL NOT PERISH 65 Wholly Other must always be radically new and one can experience it only within its metaphors."8 Frank Burch Brown has supported Crossan's view of the metaphor as the divine referent, and has gone so far as to say that theologians can address the contemporary world only after strengthening the metaphoric/conceptual dialogue: . . it is in the very nature of metaphor and thought that the historical development of faith's self-understanding would occur in part through an ongoing dialogue between conceptual and metaphoric discourse, with each mode shaping the very presuppositions with which the other works. "9 Philosophers, theologians and literary critics alike are continuing to break new ground in the study of metaphor. The contributions of the afore-mentioned critics and of Dan Via, another parable critic, provide a helpful tool with which to examine the metaphoric structure of "The Dream of the Rood." The poem presents the cross as the metaphor which opens up a new world of meaning to the reader. This metaphor shocks the reader's imagination, and redefines reality with a new vision of world. Several literary critics have noted the theological perspicacity of the poem. TTiirty years ago Rosemary Woolf traced briefly, yet quite expertly, the development of soteriological doctrine from the third through the eighth centuries, and suggested that "The Dream of the Rood" was "written at a time when both Christology and soteriology laid [a] double stress on the Crucifixion as a scene of both triumph and suffering." Woolf speaks of the poetic tension between triumph and suffering as a "paradoxical fusion" which finds its expression in the crucifixion.10 Michael Swanton makes a similar point when he says that to the early church the cross "represented the living Christ, not only in his death but in his triumph."11 Giving support to the preceding arguments, M. L. del Mastro says the poet "creates a paradox mirroring the central Christian paradox, which sees life in death, victory in defeat, and glory in shame." 12 All three critics lay special emphasis on the paradoxical crux of the poem; or more accurately, they insist that the poem achieves structure and meaning through paradox. It is quite helpful to accentuate the paradoxical quality of the poem, for paradox is created in the poem by metaphor. If metaphor consists in fusing two dissonant objects in order to produce a new world of meaning, then paradox (conceptually and</page><page sequence="4">66 CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE linguistically) is the end result of metaphor. To illustrate with the metaphor from the poem, let us visualize the cross as the metaphor which brings together human suffering and divine glory. Metaphor consists in the kinship of human suffering and divine glory; paradox consists in stating that glory is achieved through suffering. In other words, the metaphor is the object itself (the cross); the paradox is the verbal statement telling what the object (or metaphor) accomplishes: glory through suffering, exaltation through humiliation, life through death. Paradox, then, is subsumed by metaphor, which may be illustrated as a diagram. METAPHOR=CROSS HUMAN SUFFERING X DIVINE GLORY PARADOX=VERBAL ASSESSMENT OF WHAT METAPHOR DOES: "Through the cross (the metaphor), human suffering is converted into divine gloiy." "The Dream of the Rood" articulates the function and the force of metaphor in several ways. Various textual elements draw attention to the poem's central character, the cross, as metaphor. Those textual elements are the identity of the cross, the function of the cross, the self-understanding of the cross, and the new world-order that is articulated through the mouth of the cross. The dreamer, having finished describing his vision of the "syllicre treow/ on lyft laedan" (11. 4-5 - "rare tree extend into air"), introduces the tree as the "wudu selesta" (1. 27 - "best tree"). It seems ironic that a tree on which a man has been crucified is described as the best tree. When one considers that in first-century Israel the cruelest and most painful form of execution was crucifixion, then one understands that in the present context the adjective "best" is not well suited to the noun "tree." The words simply do not go together. LaMotte Idding's translation of "wudu selesta" - "wood divine"13 - serves to heighten the sense of inappropriateness. No object of human degradation should be associated with the concept of divine glory. Its identity makes the cross a metaphor, for in metaphor, Ricoeur says, "two categorical classes which were hitherto distant suddenly become close."14 The categorical classes of human suffering and divine glory have been united in the cross (see diagram above). The metaphor is repeated in different terms</page><page sequence="5">THE METAPHOR THAT WILL NOT PERISH 67 later in the poem, where the cross is described as a "wuldres beam" (1. 97- "glory tree"). The cross's function is that of bearing criminals for execution. Those who have cut down the "best tree" from the forest for crucifying people are the cross's foes (11. 30-32). Violent people use violent tactics to dispose of human life in a most painful way. The cross itself is a dreadful symbol of torment and inglorious suffering in the minds of the executioners, the executed, and the public. In an ordered world in which the most vicious criminals are killed in the most excruciating manner, the cross represents shame, humiliation and unbearable pain. But this order of the world is turned upside down when God assigns the cross a new function: that of bearing the Master of mankind to a death that is ultimately glorious and salvific. This reversal of function, and subsequent reordering of the world, are illustrated in a few lines: ic waes Ã¢hÃªawen holtes on ende, Is tyred of stefne mihÅ¯m. GeriÃ£mn mÄ ÃSBr strange fÃªbndas, geworhton him Ä·ÄÄr to wÃ£Ãªfersyne, hÄton mÄ heora wergas hebban (11. 29-31). I was cut down from the edge of the forest, removed from my stems. Strong enemies laid hold of me there, made for themselves a spectacle, commanded me to bear their criminals. Geseah ic Ä·Ä Frean manncynnes efstan eine mycie Ä·aet hÃ© mÂ£ wolde on gesfigan. J)Ã¡Ãªr ic Ä¼)Ä ne dorste ofer Dryhtnes word bÅ«gan otte berstan, Ä·Ä ic bifÃ®an geseah eorXan scÄatas. Ealleicmihte fÃªondas gefyllan, hwaeÃ®re ic faeste stÃ¶d (11. 33-38). Then I saw the master of mankind hasten with great zeal as if he would mount upon me. There I dared not bow or break, opposing the command of God, although I saw the earth's surface tremble. All my enemies I might have fallen, yet I stood fast. In the first passage the tree speaks as if it were being abused by enemies who cut it down and fashion it into an object of derision. The enemies are stronger than the tree, and they are therefore in a position to command that the tree serve their purposes. In the second passage God has replaced the enemies as commander, the</page><page sequence="6">68 CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE master of mankind has replaced criminals as condemned, the tree now seems to realize that its duty is noble, and the tree has assumed the position of strength. The only reason it does not now cut down its enemies is because it has received from God the command to stand fast. Standing fast, which usually implies fighting victoriously, means here that the tree will not fight. The tree is not, however, a passive agent whose inaction results in its own defeat. In fact, it acts in choosing not to fight. Such action, which normally results in defeat, finally results in the tree's victory over its enemies. As the poem unfolds, distant categorical classes are brought together at the cross: human suffering/divine glory, human executioners/the divine Judge, defeat in inaction/victory in choosing not to act. The present world order is turned upside down as the cross, an object of scorn, is converted into a vehicle of glory and power. Something new is being said about reality, and according to Ricoeur, that is precisely the function of metaphor: to say something new, to redefine reality, to present the reader or hearer with "a new order ... by creating rifts in an old order."15 The metaphor does more than to pour new wine into old wineskins; it bursts the old wineskins, replacing them with new vessels into which an utterly different kind of wine is poured. Metaphor here is more than linguistic likeness; it is an element that transcends the limitations of language and makes the rood a poetic figure. The metaphor of the poem is the cross itself, for the cross forces viewers to see a new world. The cross's new function and new identity are revealed in two brief lines: Rod waes ic Ã£rÃ£Ãªred; Ã£hÃµf ic nene Cyning, heofona HlÃ£ford; hyldan mÄ ne dorste (11. 44-45). A cross I was upraised; I lifted a great King, the Lord of heaven; and dared not bow. In this new world the Lord of heaven has used the basest object of earth to achieve victory through defeat. The self-understanding of the cross is most poignantly illustrated in a few lines in which it compares its old and new identities. The transformation that has occurred seems to be as much a source of wonder for the cross as for the dreamer and the reader.</page><page sequence="7">THE METAPHOR THAT WILL NOT PERISH 69 IÃ¼ ic waes geworden wita heardost, lÄodum lÄfcost, Ã¡Är Ä¼&gt;an ic him lTfes weg rihtne gerÃ½mde, reordberendum. Hwaet, mÄ Ä·Ä geweoiÃ­ode wuldres Ealdor ofer holtwude, heofonnces Weard (11. 87-91). I was the cruelest of punishments, hated by men, before I opened the right way of life for man. Lo, then the Prince of Glory exalted me above all other trees, Guardian of heaven. The cross no longer sees itself as a tragic figure, for it is the vehicle through which comic resolution is attained.16 The cross sees itself no longer through human (or more appropriately, anthropomorphic) eyes, but through the eyes of the Redeemer. Though initially fashioned by human hands into a pathetically tragic image, it has been remade by the hands of God into the divine image. The cross encourages the dreamer to see through the horrors of pain and death to the splendor of the divine image which embodies (and quite skillfully articulates) the good news of redemption. J. A. Burrow has said, "the identity and situation of the narrator, the 'consciousness' through which the events of the Crucifixion are observed . . . controls both what we see and how we see it."17 The larger portion of the poem is controlled by the vision and self-understanding of the cross. Dreamer and reader are compelled by the cross's narrative to view the cross in a dramatically new way. The cross alone explains how tragedy has been converted into comedy. The importance of the cross's self-understanding cannot be stressed too much. Dan Via has explained with great precision the connection between a protagonist's self -understanding and the final tragic or comic outcome of a narrative.18 Commenting on the parables, Via says there are scenes of recognition in which the protagonist comes to a self-understanding that heretofore he has lacked. His self-understanding forces him to see himself as either a tragic or a comic figure. Via says, "By recognition is meant the enlightenment of the protagonist with regard to the true nature of his actions at the moment of catastrophe."19 The plot structure of a narrative, according to Via, moves from action through recognition and finally either to tragic dissolution or comic resolution. But it is not incipient action which determines the</page><page sequence="8">70 CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE outcome of the story. Rather, the recognition scene, and the protagonist's response to self-recognition, determine the outcome. For example, in the parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32) the story moves through "tragic action, downfall, recognition scene"20 and finally to resolution. The prodigal son responds positively when he comes to the point of recognition, thus averting tragedy. The parable, then, is "a comedy which involves and overcomes tragedy."21 Speaking of all parables which involve plot structures like that of the parable of the Prodigal Son, Via says, "In comedy we have an upward movement toward well-being and the inclusion of the protagonist in a new or renewed society."22 Via certainly does more than simply iterate the Aristotelian definition of comedy. He demonstrates the method of applying the Aristotelian hermeneutic to parables, and to the biblical narrative(s) in general. Using precisely the method Via has explicated, the reader may observe in "The Dream of the Rood" the movement from tragic action (execution of criminals, as ordered by foes, 1. 31), downfall (being cut down from forest, and used for ignoble purpose, 11. 29-33), recognition (new identity as servant of God, 11. 87-91), finally to comic resolution (new world-order in which cross is agent of redemption rather than of death, 11. 80-86, 119-21). The cross's positive response to self-recognition (11. 37-38) results in its inclusion in the new world. Near the end of its discourse, the cross invites the dreamer to participate in this new order by telling of its transformation (11. 95-96). The cross now holds meaning for all humankind, for it is the redemptive agent which enables people to become engaged in the divine comedy of salvation. Cross and believer must now unite to overcome the tragedy of human suffering and death: Is nu sÃ Ã¨l cumen t&gt;aet mÄ weoiÃ­iaS wide ond side menn ofer moldan ond eall Ä¼&gt;Äos mÃ¡Ã©re gesceaft, gebiddaj) him to Ä·yssum bÄacne. . . . ic hÄÄlan maeg aÄghwylcne 3nra Ä¼)Ä ra Ä¼&gt;e him biÃ­ egesa tÃµ mÄ (11. 80-83, 85-86). Now the time has come when far and wide men on earth and all the glorious creation honor me,</page><page sequence="9">THE METAPHOR THAT WILL NOT PERISH 71 they bow themselves to this beacon I may heal everyone who does reverence to me. And in the final statement to the dreamer, the cross articulates its relation to the human being, to God, and to the heavenly kingdom: Surh iÃ£ rode sceal rice gesecan of eorÃ­wege Ã¡eghwylc sÃ£wl, sÃ«o Ä¼&gt;e mid Wealdended wunian Ä¼)ence$ (11. 119-21). through the cross must every soul seek out the kingdom from the earthly way, who desires to dwell with the king. Through the cross God has constructed a new world order into which dreamer and believer are drawn. The cross has taught the dreamer that life is achieved by standing fast against life's enemies as the cross did, and by mounting the cross as the master of mankind did. Thus, the Christian is to view the cross as the object through which he works out his own salvation in fear and trembling (Phillipians 2:12). The new creation has been completed; the metaphor is finished. The world molded by the rood through the metaphoric discourse of poetry is the new creation in which human suffering and death are swallowed up in divine victory.
