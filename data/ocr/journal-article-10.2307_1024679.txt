This book is divided into two parts, so- cial outlook and world view. The keynote of the first part is the theory of class strug- gle; of the second, the philosophy of dia- lectic materialism. In both parts the au- thor describes with notable clarity the elements which are distinctive of Soviet practice and thought. Society is primary, the individual sec- ondary. "The forces of production must be reckoned with as basic." "History moves onwards through struggle over the forces of production." The struggles thus generated are not, in their essence, between individuals, any more than the warfare of armies is. This is the class struggle, the absolutely fundamental conceptions in Soviet philosophy. It is inescapable even to the extent that "class membership does not depend on the awareness of the indi- vidual," for "we belong to a certain class because we exercise the function of that class." The individual plays a part, but that part is determined by social condition- ing. The class struggle, expressing itself most clearly in socialist revolution, is a world-wide phenomenon, whether recog- nized or not, and its progress is the de- veloping life of human society as a whole. The idea of the primacy of society and the secondary role of the individual runs through the chapter on political life and especially the discussion of democracy. The Soviet Government provides every- one with opportunity to work, writes into its constitution equality of men and women, provides educational opportunity to all, and guarantees freedom of speech. The author quotes Lenin: "We wish to create and we shall create a free press, free not only in the police sense of the word, but free from capital as well, free from careerism, and free, above all, from anarchic bourgeois individualism." This would seem to be a paradox, to be free from the individual, but Soviet philosophy resolves it by insisting that society is pri- mary, and society makes the individual rather than the reverse. In a revealing sentence the author writes, ."The Soviet individual would not wish to be free from the society in which he lives, even if that were possible. . ... He does not want to be let alone by the State." Even Soviet artists "do nbt ordinarily regard it as an</page><page sequence="2">BOOK DEPARTMENT 149 unwarranted intrusion if their work is criticized from the socialist viewpoint." State force is required because of re- calcitrant remnants within and antagonistic classes and states abroad. Yet, "in the presence of an economy of abundance, the dictatorial aspect would gradually die out, and a system of stateless administration would emerge." One is led to ask, What is the real occasion for state force-op- position or penury? It may also seem to many that in envisioning a stateless so- ciety, Soviet philosophy is either indulg- ing in an idealization of mankind or ascrib- ing to society formative influences far more effective than so far revealed in the Soviet Union, judged by continued punitive action. Soviet ethics are humanistic, in the sense that there is no relationship to "rules of conduct presented as the commands of an omnipotent Being"; but science, education, and rationality determine concept of good and evil. As with the idea of God, so the expectation of reward or punishment after death is ruled out. The problem of good and evil as well as that of means and ends must be seen in the setting of the Marxist world view. The author presents dialectic materialism with a clarity which is unachievable in this brief review. Materialism is a characterization of the subject matter of the universe: dia- lectic is the method of thinking about the universe or about anything at all. The author's review of the philosophic contro- versies brings out that Marxian material- ism is not mechanistic nor is it divorced from practical life: "A universe infinite and eternal, rational in character, pervaded by law, knowable by man, complex, but not mystical, sufficiently humanistic, but not anthropomorphic, to be believed in rather than blindly trusted, to be taken naturally rather than suspiciously, as an oppor- tunity rather than a promise." The inclusion of spiritual values in the materialist world view is in line with the second of the three laws of dialectic ma- terialism. The first law (the law of strife, interpenetration and unity of opposites) "expresses the fact that we live in a uni- verse of change." The second (the law of transformation of quantity into quality and vice versa) "involves the emergence of new qualities, that is, of complexes and properties not possessed before." The third (the law of negation of the negation) asserts that "the new qualitative state is a negation of the old one." Dialectic takes the place of logic; qualitative materialism rules out metaphysics. Since the author has so carefully ad- hered to Marxist thought, any criticism of the book would be a reflection of the views of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, which is not the province of a reviewer. Nevertheless, one comment is ventured. Individual freedom by nature, not as a gift of the state; honesty which is honest, not fluctuating with the "interpenetration of opposites"; goodness as a characteriza- tion of the spirit of relations between man and man, not as a reflection of the "official line"; thought processes which lead to conclusions, not to temporary "negations" --perhaps it is because these are bourgeois notions that they remain unanswered prob- lems after reading this book.
