<plain_text><page sequence="1">Old Testament Scholarship Fifty Tears in Retrospect JAMES MUILENBURG* OUR occasion of celebration offers us a welcome opportunity not only to scan the horizon of contemporary biblical studies, but also to interpret and delineate, though in rather broad and too swiftly-drawn strokes, something of the course they have taken in the past half cen- tury. One is not a little tempted to engage in reminiscence rather than retrospect, but we shall address ourselves, rather, in these days of anniversary to some of the changing frontiers of biblical study, to withdrawals from previously held positions and to the ad- vances all along the now far-flung and broken line of modern scholarly research. It is inevitable, I suppose, that one's retro- spect should be influenced in no small degree by the point of vantage he occupies, by the academic past out of which he has come, and indeed by his own particular interests and cast of mind. There is always a danger of as- suming that the positions commonly held during one's years of graduate study still mark the lines of the frontier. On the other hand, there is also the peril of discounting the gains of the past, and of ignoring the contributions of our predecessors. It is well to be reminded that there were giants in the earth in those days. The significance of the boundary line is precisely that it is deter- mined by the relation of the past to the pres- ent. Whatever gains the future may hold in store will in turn be understood, one hopes, in the light of the present. One speaks of this because signs are not wanting, especially in America, that the achievements of the late nineteenth century and opening decades of the twentieth are often disregarded and minimized, especially by the younger genera- tion of scholars, and that the careful and detailed critical studies of our forebears are cavalierly ignored and dismissed. This is true particularly in the areas of responsible his- torical criticism. When one undertakes to gain a synoptic view of the period under inspection, he is almost overwhelmed by the staggering amount of literature devoted to Old Testa- ment studies, by its great diversity and range, by the variety of contributions relat- ing to the ancient Near Eastern literatures, and by new methodologies. Nevertheless, some ordering is possible if one observes the influence of certain scholars or schools of scholarship. The investigations of Albrecht Alt and Martin Noth and those associated with them have ranged over the spacious field of archaeological, historical, and, for want of a better word, what we may call cul- tural studies, and these have been buttressed and illuminated by the techniques and in- sights of form criticism. Perhaps no single feature of our period is more striking than the scholarly productivity of the Scandina- vians. While there is considerable difference in approach and point of view among these scholars, there are also a number of common features: their employment in greater or * JAMES MUILENBURG is Davenport Pro- fessor of Hebrew and Cognate Languages in Union Theological Seminary, New York. He is author of the article on "The History of the Religion of Israel," published in Volume I of The Interpreter's Bible, and numerous other writings. Dr. Muilen- burg's connection with the National Association of Biblical Instructors may be traced back to the an- nual meeting of 1923 when he read a paper entitled "Teaching the Bible from the Literary Angle," published in Christian Education (December, 1924). This puts Professor Muilenburg among the "Old Guard" of our Association and he has been one of its most loyal members. 173</page><page sequence="2">174 JAMES MUILENBURG lesser degree of the traditio-historical method, their concern to read the biblical documents in the context of the Near East- ern literary monuments, and their pro- nounced interest in the cult, more particu- larly Near Eastern cultic patterns which are contended to have influenced Israel's litera- ture. In America the most prominent group is that gathered about W. F. Albright, whose wide learning has inspired many linguistic, archaeological, historical, textual, and lit- erary-critical studies. The English school of myth and ritual under the aegis of S. H. Hooke has received a somewhat qualified reception, but it has found its most enthusi- astic adherents in Scandinavia. We do not speak so much these days of the Religions- geschichtler, as we did in the days of Gun- kel, Gressmann, and others, but the reason may be that many of their conclusions have been absorbed in all our study and that their more extreme conclusions have been tem- pered and qualified by newer approaches to our field. Yet one must keep in mind again how strong this influence is felt in such scholars as Mowinckel, Engnell, Widen- gren, and H. G. May. Finally, we should recognize the importance of the form-critical school of Hermann Gunkel and his disciples. While this approach has received relatively little attention in England and America, Eu- ropean scholarship generally has been pro- foundly influenced by it. Yet such classification into schools is not altogether appropriate or happy, for there has been much cross-fertilization, and there are lines which lead from one to the other. Thus, for many years Albright was asso- ciated with the school of Alt, Noth, and Jirku, and, despite many differences, still shares much in common with them. All schools recognize the importance of myth and ritual, though in varying degrees. We may be critical of some of the views held by scholars like Engnell and Widengren, such as their rejection of historical criticism, their extreme emphasis upon oral tradition, and their exaggerated stress upon the place of the divine kingship and Near Eastern cultic influence in the Old Testament, but we have all profited from them, even where we are inclined to diverge from their posi- tions. This somewhat hasty survey has called at- tention to some of the major emphases and points of view characteristic of contemporary scholarship. It is clear that archaeology and the recovery of the literatures of the Ancient Near East have exercised a strong influence on biblical studies. Form criticism and cultic studies, which often go hand in hand, have been sources of great stimulation, though both have their dangers when they are carried to extremes, as they often are. The de- cline of historical criticism, not only in Scan- dinavia but elsewhere also, has been accom- panied by the forging of fresh approaches and methodologies, but these have sometimes been used as supplementary to the older methods. Other features mark our period of retrospect. A considerable literature has been devoted to psychological and anthropologi- cal interpretations of biblical mentality and social life, notably in the two influential vol- umes of Johannes Pedersen,' but also in many articles and monographs.2 The place of institutions in Israel's communal life has evoked many important studies, above all the institution of the monarchy, but also family, slavery, the holy war, and the administra- tion of justice.3 Of special importance is the remarkable advance in linguistic studies. The grammars of Bergstraesser,4 Brockelmann,5 and Bauer and Leander6 have become in- dispensable to all students of Hebrew. Many of the articles in Kittel's Theologisches W/oerterbuch zum Neuen Testament, some of which have been translated, and other word books have been a source of vitality. Special mention should be made of the im- portant linguistic studies of G. R. Driver.7 The lexicon of L. Koehler and W. Baum- gartner was published in 1953, with a sup- plement in 1958,8 and the several editions of</page><page sequence="3">OLD TESTAMENT SCHOLARSHIP 175 Gesenius-Buhl have taken account of lin- guistic progress.9 Of special interest is the recrudescence of biblical theology, perhaps the most striking change in the field of bib- lical study. It is clear that the last half cen- tury has been a period of great productivity; it has been a period of considerable change, fluidity, and, above all, of creativity. To many of us Old Testament research and study has been an exciting enterprise; our eyes are constantly being opened to things we had not seen before; new problems and issues cry aloud for fresh study; and the doors are open to all who will pay the price for competence and of unceasing effort. I should like now to comment briefly on several of the major developments to which I have already made some reference. The first of these is what is usually known in America as historical criticism. It is well known that the positions championed by the school of scholars associated with the name of Julius Wellhausen have been under attack. Rudolf Kittel, the editor of the Biblia He- braica was among the first to challenge its assumptions, particularly at the point of the date and trustworthiness of the Priestly document. The results of his critical position were classically formulated in his great work on the history of the people of Israel, which passed through many editions.1x On the other hand, many attempts have been made to re-define the scope of the documentary sources, J, E, D, and P; to analyze and de- scribe their contents more precisely; to show the nature of the relationship they bear to one another (e.g., of the northern Elohist to the Deuteronomist, or of the southern Yah- wist to the Priestly historian); and to set each of the sources in its appropriate social environment. Smend's isolation of a J2 source (1912) was followed in 1922 by Eissfeldt's Hexateuchsynopse, in which he recognized a special L document, in 1927 by Julian Morgenstern's separation of a Kenite or K document,1 and in 1941 by R. H. Pfeiffer's Edomite sources (S1 and S2). 12 The Yah- wist document is now quite generally believed to be a product of the United Monarchy; it is likely that the date of the Elohist is des- tined for revision also. Many of the argu- ments for an eighth-century dating have little cogency today. Volz and Rudolph have de- nied the existence of an Elohist source,13 but have found few if any adherents to this view. Albright and Noth and others posit a Grundschrift underlying the Yahwist and Elohist. Mowinckel finds the presence of J and E in Genesis 1-11 (after the removal of p).14 A much more creative approach to the composition of the Hexateuch was made in 1938 by G. von Rad in his study, Das form- geschichtliche Problem des Hexateuchs. In this work he sought to determine the forces at work in the gathering together of the rather diverse and disparate materials of the Hexateuch, more especially of the Yahwist document, and he sought a clue in certain credal formulations, such as those repre- sented in Deuteronomy 26 and Joshua 24 and elsewhere. There is much that is cre- ative and exciting in this work, but one must recognize the important fact that the docu- ments to which he appeals are all or nearly all in the Elohist tradition. For over a dec- ade the Book of Deuteronomy was the storm center of biblical studies. Dates have been assigned to this book all the way from the beginnings of the monarchy to the post- exilic age. The establishment of the date 621 B.C. as the year of the promulgation of the Deuteronomic Code is still generally ac- cepted, but its provenance is viewed in dif- ferent ways. Many scholars now champion the northern origin of the Book, and several of the most distinguished among them argue that its original core, Urdeuteronomium, was taken to Jerusalem by the fugitives from Samaria at the fall of the city in 722/1.15 Scores of books and monographs have been devoted to the problems of Deuteronomy, but some of its most perplexing issues still remain with us, despite the signal advances</page><page sequence="4">176 JAMES MUILENBURG made by A. C. Welch,16 Hempel,17 Dum- mermuth,1s Alt,19 Noth,20 VOn Rad,21 and others. We turn now to some of the other assaults that have been made on the documentary theory. There are two to which I should like to make special reference. The first of these comes from those who stress cultic motifs and interests in the composition of the Pentateuch and other Old Testament books. The most familiar and perhaps most influential of these is Johannes Pedersen's study of Exodus 1-15.22 Pedersen denies the presence of sources and sees the passage as a continuous cultic Legende, employed in con- nection with the celebration of the Passover festival. Cultic interests have also been seen at work in Deuteronomy (cf. von Rad's view that the sequence is similar to Exodus 19- 24), and beyond the Pentateuch, in Isaiah, Micah, Zephaniah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Joel, and even Second Isaiah as well as in the historical books, most notably in the ark nar- ratives and II Samuel 6-7. Special mention should be made of Martin Noth's studies in the history of the Pentateuchal traditions and more especially of his analysis of the so-called historical books.23 Noth discovers two major works: the Tetrateuch and the great Deuteronomic work extending from Deuteronomy through Second Kings. Von Rad's study of the theology of I-II Kings deserves recognition, for he has shown con- vincingly the theological basis upon which these books were composed, i.e., of the Word of God proclaimed by the prophets fulfilling itself in history, and the significance of the Davidic dynasty in Deuteronomic thought.24 Time fails to deal with other books. The so-called Deuteronomic passages of Jere- miah have been studied by J. Philip Hyatt25 and H. G. May26 (both influenced by Mo- winckel's monograph), while John Bright27 and H. H. Rowley28 have launched a vigor- ous counter-offensive to their views. The Book of Ezekiel has long been a center of controversy. The process of atomization has been carried out to its logical conclusions by G. Hoelscher29 and W. I. Irwin30 while the recent commentary of Fohrer31 accepts much of the book as genuine, though with nu- merous glosses. Zimmerli's commentary promises to be the most thorough and im- portant work we have yet had on this most intriguing and strange of the Old Testament prophets. In recent years there has been a reaction against B. Duhm's views of Second Isaiah, and several recent scholars have seen that the so-called Servant poems are an in- tegral part of the poems. The consequences of such a view for our understanding of the prophet's theology, especially of the Servant of the Lord, are of course plain for all to see. Among the forces which serve to explain the present status of Old Testament studies a preeminent place must be assigned to ar- chaeology. More than any other single dis- cipline it is responsible for recent recon- structions of the history of ancient Israel, as is illustrated by John Bright's recently pub- lished work. It must be insisted, however, that the archaeological evidence should al- ways be read with the evidence of the literary deposits; archaeology by no means frees us from the task of dealing with the literary records in a responsible, scientific form- critical fashion. Yet it is true that the results of the excavations in Palestine and the Near East have influenced our attitude towards the ancient texts, more particularly those preserved in such books as Genesis and Joshua. Questions relating to the Exodus and the Conquest have been hotly contro- verted, and the archaeological evidence has sometimes been susceptible of varying in- terpretations. The material remains from the mounds have helped us to reconstruct something of the daily life and practice of the ancient Hebrews; they have revealed the structures of walls and buildings, notably of early Semitic temples, such as that at Tell Tainat. Such works as Barrois' Manuel de archkologie biblique (Paris, 1939-53), Gall- ing's Reallexikon (Tiibingen, 1937), Millar</page><page sequence="5">OLD TESTAMENT SCHOLARSHIP 177 Burrows' What Mean These Stones? (1941-- 2nd ed. 1956), and Ernest Wright's Biblical Archaeology (1957), have done much to enrich our knowledge of the culture, history, and the institutions of Israel. It is true that some scholars are more reserved than others on the question of how much we can learn from the remains and of what kind of knowledge excavations can reveal. A com- parison of the histories of Martin Noth32 and John Bright33 will prove a fruitful exercise in determining the way in which the literary and archaeological lines of evidence are as- sessed. Nelson Glueck's explorations in Eastern Palestine and the Negev have made a welcome and important contribution to our knowledge of Israel's early history. His ex- cavations at Ezion-geber (Tell el-Kheleifeh) and the Chicago excavations at Megiddo have gone far to revolutionize our under- standing of the age of Solomon. A fresh impetus has been given to our studies also by the discovery of inscriptions. The importance of the Near Eastern litera- tures has long been recognized. Hugo Gress- mann's Altorientalische Texte und Bilder was first published in 1909, and it has long been an indispensable vademecum for the illumination and interpretation of biblical texts. But now we are singularly fortunate in having at our disposal the monumental work edited by J. B. Pritchard, Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testa- ment (1950), and the companion volume on The Ancient Near East in Pictures (1954) since they place these comparative literary materials in the hands of all students. The mythological and cultic texts from Ugarit have contributed to our understanding of Canaanite culture and religion, the literary features and symbols of Canaanite poetry, and, not least of all, Canaanite language, its morphology and syntax. Similarly the dis- coveries at ancient Nuzu have supplied us with the cultural and social background for much that we encounter in the patriarchal age and has thus tended to give greater cre- dence to the ancient accounts. The Mari ma- terials, too, have cast light upon the social and cultural forces lying behind the Book of Genesis. The publication of the Babylonian Chronicle by C. J. Gadd in 1923, in itself an event of some importance, has now been sup- plemented by substantial portions of the same Chronicle by D. J. Wiseman, and be- sides we have the Lachish ostraca from the closing years of the kingdom of Judah." These and other records, both biblical and extra-biblical, make the period from 631 to 538 B.C. one of the most richly documented in the history of Israel. But we must not neglect another area in which archaeological discoveries have played a role in our under- standing of the Old Testament records. I refer, of course, to Hebrew law. The codes of Ur-Nammu, Lipit Ishtar, Eshnunna, and Hammurabi have added to our knowledge of ancient law and to the comparative ma- terial at our disposal. Among the scholars who have directed their investigations to bib- lical law, Albrecht Alt's work on the origins of Israelite law is one of the most interesting and important, not only for its recognition of casuistic and apodictic formulations but also for the cultic settings in which he places them."35 Martin Noth has also written ex- tensively on this subject, often in a very stimulating and suggestive fashion.36 Finally, the covenant formulations of the Old Testa- ment, particularly those of Exodus 19-24, have been studied by George Mendenhall in the light of Hittite state treaties, more par- ticularly the suzerainty treaties. I referred above to the importance of archaeology for our reconstruction of Israel's history. Oes- terley and Robinson's History of Israel has long served a useful purpose and for some years has dominated the field in English. The various editions of Rudolph Kittel's Ge- schichte des Volkes Israels have been monu- mental contributions to our period; Yehez- kel Kaufmann has written in Hebrew a num- ber of volumes on Israel's history; Moshe Greenberg's translation of much of this work</page><page sequence="6">178 JAMES MUILENBURG is awaited with keen anticipation. Martin Noth and John Bright, as I have already said, give us books of quite a different kind, and they are both indispensable for the mod- ern student. Perhaps it is permissible to record one's regret that the revised edition of the Cambridge Ancient History has failed to make its appearance. It is historical writing of such scope and detail which is sorely needed. Notable among the approaches to the study of the Old Testament during the past half century has been what is commonly de- scribed in Germany as Gattungsforschung or what is customarily styled form criticism in the English-speaking world. By far the most creative and stimulating influence in this field has been the work of Hermann Gunkel, successor to B. Stade at Berlin and for some years professor at Halle. In 1906, in the volume on The Oriental Literatures in the series Kultur der Gegenwart (I, 7), Gunkel laid the foundations for a history of the literature of Israel. Previous attempts had been made in this direction, but they were necessarily vitiated by the absence of bi- ographical data which such a history normally requires and by the impossibility of dating the literary materials in anything but a very general way. Gunkel therefore suggested another method whereby the creative forces which went to the making of the literature might be exposed. First, he sought to identify the various literary types and forms (Gattungen), which he did with consummate skill. He recognized as no one before him or after him the formal aspects of Hebrew literary composition. In his great commen- tary on the Book of Genesis, published five years before the Programmschrift in Kultur der Gegenwart, he had already isolated many of the literary types and had dealt with them in a fascinating fashion. It was like a cold fresh wind from the north; even today there is no more exciting and, in some ways, no more perceptive work on Genesis. Many passages of the Old Testament came under Gunkel's expert scrutiny and were trans- formed by his aesthetic insight and critical skill. The same qualities were reflected in an even more masterly fashion in his monu- mental commentary on the Psalter, expecially in the Einleitung of 458 pages, which was brought to completion by J. Begrich (G6t- tingen, 1933). But to the examination of literary types Gunkel added a second inquiry, into the Sits im Leben, the situation in life of the particular type, the occasion in the com- munal life of Israel or the life of the indi- vidual in which the poem or narrative was employed. Gunkel thus became concerned with the pre-literary context of the Gattung, and from here he sought to trace its history throughout the whole Old Testament. It was a healthy reaction to the excesses of historical criticism, especially of the attempt to date each Psalm, which either foundered on the rocks of subjectivity or failed because of an a priori assumption that all the psalms were late. Gunkel and those who followed him helped to turn the tide, so that today per- haps the majority of scholars hold to a pre- exilic dating of most of the psalms, and pre- cisely because the Sitz im Leben demands some such view. But to this Gunkel added still a third concern: to group the specimens of a particular type, whether in the literature of Israel or in the wider contexts of the lit- eratures of other Near Eastern peoples or, indeed, in other cultures beyond these con- fines. Gunkel's creativity, his aesthetic bent of mind, his prodigious learning, his intuitive grasp of the modes and nuances of words and forms, all this equipped him in a remarkable way for decades of intensive labor on He- brew literary composition. His work fortu- nately bore abundant fruit in the work of his successors; more than any other single scholar, he is responsible for rescuing the commentator from prosaic dullness and tedium. Those who have not learned from him usually fail to illumine the text or to discover its inner secret. We are not refer- ring to aesthetic appreciation merely, but</page><page sequence="7">OLD TESTAMENT SCHOLARSHIP 179 also to creative interpretation. That his work had its short-comings is true: for example, he often failed to see the biblical compositions in their wider contexts; he was too much occupied with the isolated unit; he often resorted to unwarranted emendations; he was probably mistaken in tracing the literary de- velopment from short units to expanded literary forms, and theologically he was the child of his day. We have referred to the salutary influence he exerted on the Alt-Noth school. The Scandinavians, above all Sig- mund Mowinckel, owe a like debt to him. One has only to examine such works as the various volumes in Die Schriften des Alten Testaments series or Das Alte Testament Deutsch series or H. J. Kraus' commentary on the Psalms and many other works to ap- preciate the extent to which form criticism has become the property of the modern scholar. The neglect of this field is one of the major defects of R. H. Pfeiffer's Introduc- tion to the Old Testament; by contrast, Otto Eissfeldt's Einleitung is a much more useful work, for he almost always does justice to this aspect of Old Testament research. Nor should we fail to mention the useful volumes of Aage Bentzen's introduction. There is no comparable work in English to his first volume, for there the Gattungen are dis- cussed seriatim, often, however, in the light of the suppositions of his Swedish colleagues. Closely allied to form-critical studies is the current pre-occupation with the cult of ancient Israel. This field has become so large and varied as to defy summary. Nowhere has this approach proved more fruitful than in our study of the Psalter. Most influential here has been the work of S. Mowinckel, espe- cially his famous study on the enthronement psalms and the origin of eschatology. It is a work to be carefully read and pondered. That Mowinckel exaggerated his case is true, I think, but his theory has considerable force for at least some of the psalms (47, 93, 96-99). Artur Weiser has made much of the annual celebration of the covenant, espe- cially in his commentaries on Jeremiah and the Psalms. He too has overstated the case, but the presence of such a celebration in ancient Israel is now widely accepted. H. J. Kraus has written illuminatingly on an annual celebration of a festival of Zion in which David was proclaimed the elected servant of Yahweh and Zion his holy dwelling."7 The royal psalms have received much study, especially in connection with the wider field of the sacral king. The so-called Hofstil, stressed by Gressmann and others, is now much better understood, thanks to our increased knowledge of Near Eastern litur- gies. The most striking of all the developments of the past half century, and I suspect to many of us the most fruitful and significant, has been the revival of biblical theology. The reasons are not far to seek. The domination of the historical approach to the Scriptures, ever since the publication of Gabler's famous monograph in 1787, was so strong that few scholars were tempted to undertake the task of rendering the faith of ancient Israel into the orderly and systematic form that theology requires. The prevailing stress was upon the diversities of biblical thought, so that men were wont to speak of the religions of Israel, or the religious ideas of the Old Testament, or Israel's moral and social ideals. The characteristic features of Semitic cultural mentality, its anthropomorphic, dramatic, narrative and poetic modes of expression, did not easily lend themselves to the structures of thought congenial to modern men. Scholars were only too aware of the distor- tions of the systematic formulations in pre- vious centuries. Sometimes the difficulties were met by writing two companion volumes: one on the history of Israel's religion, the other on the theology of the Old Testament, so that one might serve as the corrective to the other. Sellin produced a work of this kind, and more recently Otto Procksch has written a much more extensive book using the same method.</page><page sequence="8">180 JAMES MUILENBURG The demands for biblical theology are legitimate, but precarious, and I am doubtful whether the problems and difficulties in the way have been resolved. Ernest Wright has made a valiant attempt in his stimulating book on God Who Acts (London, 1952) to describe what a biblical theology should be. In some sense, I suppose, all theology should be an engagement with the contemporary mind. Surely the prophets and poets of Israel entered into polemic with the world view of their times. Attention should always be given to the influences of Near Eastern religions, more particularly the Canaanite religion, upon Israel's faith. This is recognized in W. Eichrodt's great theological work,38 perhaps the best attempt that has thus far been made to write a biblical theology. But we have had other good books in this area also; one thinks here of those by Millar Burrows,39 Baab,40 Imschoot,41 Koehler,'2 Jacob,43 Vriezen,4 and more recently, Gerhard von Rad.45 The special merit of von Rad's work is its histori- cal orientation; no one has really grappled with the difficulties of a biblical theology so well as he, but it is precisely his historical formulations which make his work unsatis- factory to those who are more "theologically" minded. Aubrey Johnson has published a number of studies preliminary to a future work in this field. And I must speak, too, of Johannes Hempel's study of Hebrew piety, in Gott und Mensch im Alten Testament (Stuttgart, 1926). Many attempts that have been made to wrestle with the ever vexing questions of hermeneutics and to make the Old Testament contemporary to modern man, to actualize in the immediacy of the present the sacred events of Israel's election- covenant past. What shall we say, then, of our frontier ? It is clear that it is an extensive one, even more than our summary review has indi- cated. It is a line where many eager engage- ments, of many different kinds, are being fought. There have been recessions, but also advances, and in every area we have ex- amined there have been exaggeration and excess, but also the reverse, a tendency to minimize or discount the recent gains. This is surely nothing new. But time has a way of correcting and disciplining us. How the future will deal with the achievements of the past half century and what methods it will discover for our understanding of the Scrip- tures is difficult to predict. But that the past half century has been a period of genuine progress, certainly of great activity in many areas of study; that it has helped us to work with the biblical texts in new and stimulating ways; that it has opened vistas of which our predecessors were unaware; that it has re- called biblical theology to a position of dignity and even centrality, these are claims which have some justification.
