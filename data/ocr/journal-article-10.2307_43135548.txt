Problems and Practices on the Rock Art of Tadrart Akakus (SW Libya, Central Sahara) Savino di Lernia &amp; Marina Gallinaro ( «Y, 'Ji i Abstract Résumé Rock art contexts are a fragile aspect of the world's cultural heritage and have always attracted the attention of scientists, institutions, stakeholders, and visitors. UNESCO gives due recognition to this significance by including many art sites on its World Heritage List. The Tadrart Akakus in SW Libya was awarded this status in 1985. However, over the past decade, given a series of threats (tourism, infrastructure , oil exploitation), these Holocene art sites have become increasingly endangered. The central authorities and local stakeholders have failed to reach a unanimous consensus on the best practices to be adopted to tackle the situation; proposed solutions range from the total closure of the area to self-regulation. The research presented here aims to demon- strate that simple measures at individual sites (information panels, fences), integrated in a comprehensive inter- and multi-disciplinary study of rock art contexts (in particular, statistical and GIS analysis), may represent the best way to help politicians and stakeholders to dynamically manage a cultural heritage site. Les contextes d'art rupestre représentent un aspect fragile du patrimoine culturel mondial et ils ont toujours attiré l 'atten- tion des scientifiques, des institutions, des parties prenantes et des visiteurs. L 'Unesco reconnaît cette importance, comme le démontre l'inclusion de nombre de ces sites dans la Liste du Patrimoine Mondial. Le Tadrart Akakus, dans le sud- ouest de la Libye, a obtenu ce statut en 1985 : dans les 10 dernières années, du fait d'une série de menaces (tourisme, infrastructures, exploitation du pétrole), ces lieux d'art de l 'Holocène ont été en péril permanent. Les autorités centrales et les opérateurs locaux n 'ont pas trouvé de consensus una- nime sur les meilleurs pratiques à adopter pour affronter la situation : les solutions proposées vont de la fermeture totale de la zone à 1' autorégulation. La recherche présentée ici se propose de démontrer comment des mesures simples sur des sites individuels (panneaux d'information, clôtures), alliées à une vaste étude inter- et pluridisciplinaire des contextes d'art rupestre (en particulier, analyses statistiques et GIS), peuvent représenter le meilleur moyen pour aider les politiques et les parties intéressées à gérer de façon dynamique un site du patrimoine culturel.

Gallinaro Introduction The Saharan massifs, currently one of the most arid lands of the world, host thousands of archaeological sites, spanning from the most ancient Palaeolithic times to the last Holocene human occupations, still persisting today in certain areas. A precious part of this immense archive is the presence of rock art sites, extraordinary in quantity, quality and state of preservation. Thousands of engravings and paintings made in the last ten millen- nia decorate rock walls and shelters. These evidences, first recorded by western travellers in the nineteenth century (Barth 1857-1958), became one of the main topics of research in the Sahara (Lhote 1958; Mori 1965; Muzzolini 2001, here references). The Saharan rock art represents an outstanding record of the ideo- logical values of ancient human groups and plays a crucial role in the archaeological reconstruction of the environmental and socio-cultural dynamics occurring during the Holocene, from the first hunting-gathering communities to the emergence of early state polities, such as the Garamantes (e.g., Mori 1965; Barich 1987; Cremaschi &amp; di Lernia 1998; Le Quellec 1998; Hachid 2000; Muzzolini 2001; Mattingly 2003; Holl 2004; Liverani 2005; Smith 2005). However, rock art is a fragile resource affected by natural and anthropic threats that may irreparably damage it. This paper discusses the case of the Tadrart Akakus (Fig. i), a sandstone mountain range populated today by a few Tuareg families, located near the Algerian- Libyan border in the heart of the central Sahara. This massif hosts one of the richest concentrations of Saha- ran rock art, included in 1985 on the UNESCO list of Fig. 1.

Although for the Tassili the motivations underlying their inclusion on the UNESCO list were broader (emphasising the importance of this area from both a cultural and artistic point of view, Criteria II and III, and from a natural and environmental standpoint, Criteria VII and VIII), the richness and exceptional quality of their rock art was certainly the decisive factor for both zones. This is per- fectly in line with the criteria applied in other parts of the world: roughly 90 % of the prehistoric sites on the UNESCO list are in fact contexts characterised by artworks (Boccardi 2008). tourist destination thanks to both the majesty of the landscape and the richness of its cultural heritage. Un- fortunately its WH UNESCO status appears insufficient to protect this area from anthropic damages caused by increasing tourism, oil exploitation and the need for infrastructure development - not to mention the severe erosion typical of desert environments. The aim of this paper is to discuss the conservation and management challenges presented by the rock art of the Tadrart Akakus, and to suggest concrete actions for the development of flexible management plans. The rock art of Tadrart Akakus: outline of the research Rock art in the Tadrart Akakus takes the form of both paintings and engravings (Fig. 2), in different locations (rock shelter, cave, cliff, isolated boulders). Five main Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 9 (2), 2011 161</page><page sequence="4">S. di Lernia &amp; M. Gallinaro "styles" have been recognised (Lhote 1958; Mori 1965) and are used here. They can be summarised as follows ( contra , both nomenclature and chronology - Muz- zoLiNi 1991; Le Quellec 1998): i) "Wild Fauna": engravings only, representing wild animals, typical of more humid, southern environments. On the basis of superimpositions, the nature and weathering of the rock varnish, the type of subjects and specific stylistic aspects, these engravings are thought to be the earliest form of Saharan rock art. It could be assumed that there are possible cultural associations with Early Akakus hunter-gatherers, archaeologically dated to the beginning of the Holocene (ca 10,000-9000 bp). ii) "Round Heads", mainly paintings with some en- gravings. Anthropomorphic figures with rounded heads are often associated with wild animals, es- pecially Barbary sheep and other antelopes. Late Akakus foragers, radiocarbon dated in the area to around 9000-7400 bp, have been associated with this art form. iii) "Pastoral", paintings and engravings. This is the most common type of rock art, with thousands of sites throughout the Sahara, mainly depicting domestic cattle and pastoral life. Indications from excavations both in the Tadrart Akakus (Mori 1965) and Messak (di Lernia &amp; Gallinaro 2010), together with radiocarbon determinations on paint samples (Mori et al. 2006), indicate the 6th millen- nium bp as the apex of this art style. On the basis of archaeological data, however, it is possible that this style survived for a long period, from around 7000 to 4000 bp. iv) "Horse/Bitriangular", mostly paintings with some engravings. This style is dominated by the presence of domestic horses and schematic humans - rep- resented by the geometric outline of two opposed triangles - often interpreted as individuals of high status. A combination of historical sources (the introduction of horses) and archaeological infor- mation (some contexts with terminus ante quem data) allows us to bracket this style approximately between 4000 and 2500 bp. v) "Camel", both paintings and engravings. A com- mon style, with camel ( Camelus dromedarius) as its characteristic feature. Palm trees, orchards and possible outlines of fortified sites are the typical subjects of this style, generally associated with the Garamantian culture {ca VI century BC - III century AD). Since 1955, the fieldwork activities of the "The Italian-Libyan Archaeological Mission in the Akakus and Messak", Sapienza University of Rome, have often focused on shelters and caves hosting rock art elements (e.g., di Lernia 2006). From the outset, the Italian- Libyan Mission, albeit intermittently, has devoted financial and human resources to the issue of rock art conservation. Some preliminary assessments were made in the past (Mori 1965: 211-212; Ponti 1992; Fazio &amp; Lulli 2008). These were aimed mainly at identifying the pigments used, the main causes of weathering and damage and possible forms of restoration. More recently, the Mission radically changed its aims and organisation in favour of a landscape approach, in order to isolate and define the relation- ships between physical environment, archaeological contexts and rock art features (Cremaschi et al. 2005; di Lernia &amp; Zampetti 2008; Zampetti 2008; di Lernia &amp; Gallinaro 2010). From 2001 onwards, annual cam- paigns of systematic surveys have led to the discovery and contextualisation of hundreds of sites. This change in approach was due not only to a much-needed theoretical shift (Chippindale &amp; Nash 2004; Bradley 2009) but also to tackle the important changes taking place in Libya. Special emphasis was laid on the state of preservation and accessibility, and several efforts were directed at proposing active herit- age conservation measures. Threats to the rock art of the Tadrart Akakus Environmental conditions in the heart of the Saharan desert are extremely harsh: the wind and temperature changes are among the major causes of erosion. Accord- ing to rough estimates made during our geoarchaeologi- cal survey, it is likely that up to nearly 50 % of rock artworks have almost totally vanished (Cremaschi et al. 2008). In addition, an increasing influx of tourists has affected the entire Fezzan with a particular concentra- tion in our study area, especially after the end of the embargo (di Lernia 2005). Recent estimates, based on tourist passes issued by local authorities, show figures of several thousand people per year. Desert areas are delicate environments and this kind of impact has a dramatic effect. Rock art is particularly badly affected, due to both the human presence (involuntary damage) and various types of vandalism. We are mainly concerned with the preservation and sustainable exploitation of rock art, which appears 162 Journal of African Archaeology Vol 9 (2), 2011</page><page sequence="5">Working in a UNESCO WH Site Fig. 3.

Recent research, which combines geoarchaeologi- cal data with the description of rock art (di Lernia 2005; Cremaschi et al. 2008; Zampetti 2008), allows us to iden- tify various causes of decay due to natural and anthropic factors (Fig. 3). Wind erosion and either biological or chemical processes, intensified by human intervention, lead to the exfoliation, disappearance or collapse of the decorated surfaces. Uncontrolled and senseless acts of vandalism (graffiti, looting, scratching, and removals) have contributed to the alarmingly poor state of preser- vation of this rock art heritage. In particular, a dramatic episode was recorded in April 2009, when ten rock art sites in the northern area of wadi Awis and along the course of wadi Senaddar (Fig. 4) were severely damaged with spray-paint (di Lernia et al 2010).

In detail the scene before the vandalism. Alongside problems that disturb rock art sites directly, we should also be aware of a number of other factors affecting their archaeological and environmental context. The conservation and protection of rock art sites should therefore encompass both the archaeological de- posits and the surrounding landscape (this is particularly important for the possible future redefinition of the area as a "Cultural Landscape"). The uncontrolled access to the region by thousands of visitors causes in fact dif- ferent types of damage: i) the archaeological sites are destroyed or displaced by the passage of 4WD cars; ii) rubbish of all sorts is left everywhere with no respect for both the environment and the cultural heritage; iii) archaeological artefacts (e.g., lithics, grinding stones, pottery sherds, ostrich egg-shell beads) are looted for personal purposes or for sale. The Tadrart Akakus and surroundings are part of the large areas of Sahara in danger of being 'sterilised' (Keenan 2007) by visitors, scholars and industrial companies. Classifying the resource As briefly mentioned, from 2001 to 2008 the main Tadrart Akakus wadis were systematically surveyed, confirming the motivations that led UNESCO to in- clude this area on the World Heritage List; hundreds of sites, most of outstanding value, punctuate the region (Cremaschi et al. 2005; Cremaschi et al. 2008; Zampetti 2008). The data collected have been stored in a GIS platform. From this archive we have extracted and elaborated the rock art attributes that are functional to develop the analyses and proposal focused on the preservation and management issues. The definition of a rock art site represents an un- solved topic of rock art research, repeatedly stressed (e.g. , Whitley 200 1 ; Chippindale 2004). A rock art site is here conventionally defined as any type of engraved or painted figure or cluster of figures (zoomorphic, anthropomorphic, plant, or abstract) occurring within a 'physically defined' space. In the Tadrart Akakus mas- sif, in fact, the art is mostly located in correspondence with discrete geographic entities, as well as in rock shelters, caves, or isolated boulders. When rock art panels occur along the cliffs, vertical rock walls rais- ing at the edges of the wadis and higher terraces, site's boundaries are arbitrarily defined. 164 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 9 (2), 2011</page><page sequence="7">Working in a UNESCO WH Site Among the attributes of a site we recall here physiography and type. According to Cremaschi &amp; di Lernia (1998: 346), physiography refers to the landscape surrounding the site, providing the main information about its geomorphological context. It is defined as follows: 'wadi bottom' - the flat alluvial valleys crossing the massif; ' 1st terrace' - a flat geo- logical structure 30-1 00m above the wadi bottom; '2nd terrace' - the remnants of the peneplain existing in the interfluvial areas. When a site is located between the wadi bottom and the 1st terrace, the physiography has been indicated as 'intermediate'. The type refers to the context of the site: 'boulder', 'cave', 'rock shel- ter', and 'cliff' (as described above). For each style represented we have considered technique (painting or engraving), state of preservation, quantity, and significance. Other than the unique geomorphological charac- teristics of the sites, the styles recorded at a single site may be multiple. In fact, veritable palimpsests, featur- ing figures of different styles are often clustered in the same physical space. For the purpose of this paper, the attributes of styles have been defined for coding the huge quantity of information recorded for each figure of the same style present in a site. As a result, mul- tiphase sites have been repeatedly counted according to the number of styles included. It implies that the following attributes (state of preservation, quantity, and significance) only refer to the figures of the same style recorded at a given site. The state of preserva- tion defines the physical state of the rock art evidence. Due to several factors (position in the site, presence of overlap with other figures, localised human or natural damages, etc.), this can potentially vary for each figure, but the data recorded for the sites - except for rare cases - show a substantial homogeneous trend of the state of preservation of figures of the same style. This trend allowed for the assessment of an average value for each style present in a site: 'bad' when the artworks are almost invisible or highly damaged; 'scarce' when the outlines of the figures are visible but the details are evanescent; 'good' when the artworks are visible also in detail; 'ND' when data are not available (lost, not collected, etc.). The quantity provides a rough estimate of the frequency/rarity of figures of the same style: 'scarce' for the presence of a single figure; 'average' when the total number of the figures is similar to the average number of the other sites; 'high' when the total number of figures is greater than the average medium value of the other sites; 'ND' when data are not available (lost, not collected, etc.). Finally, we introduce the concept of significance in order to recall the UNESCO concepts of "outstand- ing universal value" and emphasise the "quality and exceptional nature" of the site. Also, in defining and coding this attribute we tried to mediate between a pure scientific approach and the need to adopt the UNESCO guidelines in terms of cultural resource management. Admittedly, this is a largely subjective evaluation, rising from the overall knowledge of the rock art analysed, and its role in the broader archaeological and cultural landscape. In defining this attribute, we have taken into account several factors. For each style represented in a site we considered the coded attributes discussed above and other factors difficult or impossible to be encoded (e.g., complexity, originality, rarity and cultural/archae- ological value). It is important to outline here that the definition of the 'significance' is not intended to create a ranking of the importance, but rather to outline the "unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilization which is living or which has disappeared" (UNESCO, Criterion III for the selection: http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/). A 'low' significance has been attributed when the artworks of the style do not include peculiar traits enhancing the knowledge of the style; 'medium' when the artworks present the widely diffuse traits of the style; 'high' when the art- works represent an exceptional expression of a style; 'ND' when data are not available (lost, not collected, etc.). As an example, some grazing cattle in Pastoral style is less 'significant' than (rarer) scenes of daily life such as milking (e.g., Teshuinat II - Gallinaro et al. 2008: 136-141) or hairdressing (e.g., Uan Amil - ibid.: 1 57-1 63), not to mention rituals (e.g. , the 'boat' at Uan Muhuggiag - ibid.: 142-156). This approach, though in many ways subjective, is helpful for the definition of the priorities to be used for the creation of a management plan: by means of the combination of distribution, density, significance, ac- cessibility, and state of preservation of rock art sites, we were able to map the most critical areas and select the measures to be proposed to Libyan authorities, policy makers and stakeholders. Analysis of rock art sites Distribution and main geomorphological features The database includes rock art contexts mapped and published by Mori (1965), sites located in the early 1990s (Cremaschi &amp; di Lernia 1998) and the system- atic survey undertaken from 2001 to 2008 (Zampetti 2008). So far, a total of 491 sites have been mapped and recorded; examining the satellite image, the widespread distribution of rock art sites is evident, with a major clustering on the eastern side of the mountain (Fig. 5).

Colour Key: white = 'wadi bottom'; red = 'intermediate'; green = ' 1st terrace'; yellow = '2nd terrace'. Despite the survey carried out in the highest parts of the Tadrart Akakus, there is in fact a strong imbalance between sites located along wadis and sites on the upper terraces. This bias may become less apparent with new intensive fieldwork, at the western side of the massif, not included in this analysis. However, during reconnais- sance surveys carried out in the last years on the second terrace, we noticed that this is characterised by highly deflated surfaces and isolated reliefs, but given the strong erosional phenomena only few artefacts are still visible. Furthermore, it is obvious that geological and geomor- phological processes lead to an uneven distribution of rock shelters and caves throughout the Tadrart Akakus: they are more frequent in the central-southern areas of the massif, whereas the northern regions are characterised by small shelters (niche type) and rock walls (Cremaschi 1998). Tifinagh writings and inscriptions, not discussed here, are fairly common along the main paths connecting the western scarp with the main Tadrart Akakus wadis (Liverani 2005; Biagetti et al. in press). 166 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 9 (2), 2011</page><page sequence="9">Working in a UNESCO WH Site Site typology Rock Boulder Cave Cliff c .

Main attributes of rock art sites, by stylistic attributions. Most rock art sites are located on the wadi bottom, or a few metres above it ("intermediate"). As a conse- quence, almost all the rock art is easily accessible by 4WD car or on foot, through climbing a few metres up the sandstone walls, with a potential immediate impact on their preservation (Tab. 1). Nearly 80 % of rock art sites, regardless of their complexity and importance, are located inside rock shelters: again, this pattern may be partially biased by the better preservation of paintings in areas out of direct sunlight, such as shelters and deep caves (though these are very rare). Isolated boulders and open-air cliffs are rarer (and almost exclusively used for engravings), but these figures, which are less easy to see in the field, are certainly under-represented when compared to shelters. A rock art site often hosts several paintings and/or engravings in different styles - believed to represent different phases of human activity. There are over 800 artworks belonging to the main styles described above, a figure that clearly indicates the richness of this ancient cultural heritage (Tabs. 2 and 5). According to this initial estimate, the most com- mon style is Pastoral (ca 50 %), followed by Camel (2 1 %) and Horse/Bitriangular ( 1 5 .4 %). Round Heads and Wild Fauna artworks are much rarer (5.7 % and 3.1 % respectively). Physiographical features and loca- tion do not appear to be correlated with style. With the exception of Wild Fauna engravings, the locations of artworks are also fairly similar. Wild Fauna engravings are more frequently found on isolated boul- Joumal of African Archaeology Vol. 9 (2), 2011 167</page><page sequence="10">S. di Lernia &amp; M.

The quantity of artworks found at any given site does not appear to depend on the style and presents fairly similar trends (Tab. 3): the exceptions are Round Heads and Horse/Bitriangular assemblages. In particular, Round Head paintings and engravings are on average more abundant, with scenes consisting of dozens of subjects. Round Head works have the highest average im- portance, presenting a very different trend compared to other styles. This may reveal a strong bias resulting from the subjectivity of our attributions: the other styles show similar trends, with slightly higher percentages for Horse/Bitriangular contexts (20.9 %). The state of preservation of rock art is extremely difficult to evaluate. If we examine the raw figures (Tab. 3), the Tadrart Akakus rock art is apparently in a good state. However, when we calculate the values for the degree of preservation by technique, the percent- ages vary considerably. As we might expect, engraved features are often well preserved (80 %); this is less frequently the case for paintings (25 %). Interestingly, the various styles show different values for preserva- tion: these are not correlated with chronology but rather with a specific location within the site and, likely, with their composition and binder/pigments used (Mori 1965; Mori et al 2006). So far, none of the parameters considered (such as the physiographical position, site typology or importance) correlates specifically with the different states of preservation recorded. Density analysis In order to gain additional hard data to better define the most sensible segments of the Tadrart Akakus rock art, taking into account critical elements such as preserva- tion, safeguard, study, and accessibility, we have run several spatial analyses: the analysis of density appears to be the most efficient to define and isolate the sensible areas. Density estimates based on the kernel method, a non-parametric way calculated on the quadratic func- tion described in Silvermann (1986: 76), have been applied to different parameters for both sites and art features. The analyses - developed in a GIS environ- ment (ArcGis ver. 9.3) - calculate the density of data in a neighbourhood around each output raster cell. Sites are concentrated throughout the eastern side of the massif and along the main wadis. However, three areas appear to present an exceptionally high density: i) the northern part of the massif, known as Awis area; ii) the central wadi of Raharmellen, and its tributary wadi Agmir, up to the middle course of Senaddar; and iii) the middle course of wadi Teshuinat. Other density peaks can be seen along the middle course of wadi Rawelen (central Tadrart Akakus), and in the south along the upper course of wadi Anshal and wadi Afozzigiar (Fig. 6a). The density of the artworks differs depending on the technique: engravings are commonly more frequent and evenly distributed in the north and centre of the massif, particularly in two wadis in the Awis area and along the course of wadi Raharmellen and wadi Agmir. By contrast, paintings present the highest densities 168 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 9 (2), 2011</page><page sequence="11">Working in a UNESCO WH Site along wadi Teshuinat, wadi Senaddar and the middle course of wadi Afozzigiar. The spatial clustering of different artworks is extremely varied, but only partially related to differ- ent styles. The contexts with Wild Fauna subjects are significantly represented only in the central area of the Tadrart Akakus, with a high density along the middle and upper course of wadi Raharmellen and between it and wadi Rawelen immediately to the north (Fig. 6b). The highest density of Round Head art features can be found along the middle course of wadi Teshuinat, and along wadi Afozzigiar. Other high densities are present elsewhere, as can be seen in Figure 6c. As previously stressed, the Pastoral style is the most widespread form of rock art in the study area. Given the large numbers of artworks, the concentrations of Pastoral paintings and engravings essentially mirrors the overall site density, but for the presence of a high and evenly distributed concentration in the southern part of the Takarkori area (Fig. 6d). The art features belonging to the Horse/Bitriangular style have a large area of high density along wadi Raharmellen, wadi Agmir and wadi Senaddar. In wadi Teshuinat their density is also significant. Other small and spotted peaks are mainly located in the southern part of the massif (Fig. 6e). The Camel style is primarily found in the northern and central Tadrart Akakus; higher densities can be seen in the Awis area and between wadi Raharmellen and wadi Agmir, its southern tribu- tary. This rock art style also presents a fairly high density along the middle course of wadi Teshuinat (Fig. 6f). The highest densities of artworks in a poor state of preservation (both paintings and engravings) are found along the middle course of wadi Teshuinat and wadi Senaddar. These values are correlated with the frequencies of Pastoral features in wadi Teshuinat and of Round Head and Horse/Bitriangular features in wadi Senaddar (Fig. 7a). The spatial distribution of artworks in a good state of preservation varies considerably considering both the combined and split frequencies for paintings and engravings. The areas of highest density can be found to the north in the Awis area, and along wadis Raharmellen, Agmir and Senaddar. If we isolate painted features, the highest densities occur along the middle course of wadi Teshuinat and partially along wadi Raharmel- len. In both cases, Camel is the most frequent style (Fig. 7b). As for the significance, the highest concentrations of low value contexts are located in wadi Raharmellen and its surroundings and to the north in the Awis area. The highest concentration of high values can be found along the middle course of wadi Teshuinat, with other spotted high densities to be found in the northern wadis and along the middle courses of wadi Senaddar and wadi Afozzigiar (Fig. 8). The presence in wadi Teshu- inat of the most famous rock art scenes discovered by Mori from the 1950s heavily affect this distribution, producing a very high score; nevertheless, these scenes indisputably are among the masterpieces of the whole Tadrart Akakus. Ongoing interventions on rock art sites Environmental features and cultural heritage are unique and non-renewable resources everywhere in the world. Whilst awaiting a proper management plan and the crea- tion of a National Park, some steps to protect the rock art sites have already been taken in recent years, and are currently ongoing. The leading criteria have been (and still are) directed towards simple actions, possibly featuring a low impact on the site(s), easy implementa- tion and modest maintenance: this approach proved to be sufficiently appropriate for the Libyan context, where the relations between central institutions (Tripoli) and peripheral seats (Ghat) are often difficult, and where the local expertise - when and if present - is usually concentrated in urban contexts, along the Mediterranean coast, far from our study area. To begin with the need to increase the local capacity building, files on archaeological and rock art sites were delivered to representatives of the Libyan Department of Archaeology (Do A) as field reports at the end of each season; at the same time, all this information was entered in a GIS platform accessible to the DoA and other local institutions. In order to minimise the impact of mass tourism on rock art contexts, some sites have been closed to vehicular access using fences and a very few, particu- larly endangered, sites to tourists as well. This difficult decision, however, should be considered as a compro- mise from the initial request by the Libyan Minister of Tourism to forbid the access to the major wadis, also for the Tuareg families still living there. The fences take the form of concrete bases and iron uprights, covered by traditional palm netting. Information panels with notes on major cultural and archaeological features have been placed in the vicinity of selected sites (Fig. 9). In our perspective, this meas- ure, proposed in accordance with the main international treaties for the protection and management of cultural heritage sites (Venice Charter 1964; ICOMOS 1990; ICOMOS 2008), was aimed at creating a symbolic and moveable boundary to keep visitors away from the rock art and, when present, the archaeological deposit. At the same time, people could see the rock art. The Journal of African Archaeology Vol . 9 (2), 2011 169</page><page sequence="12">S. di Lernia &amp; M. Gallinaro Fig. 6.

Example of a fence and information panel placed in selected rock art sites. information panels communicate an awareness of the outstanding universal value of this heritage, giving visitors a sense of responsibility and abolishing " the notion of terra incognita " (Barré 2003). Although this proposal has in part been reinter- preted by the local authorities, in terms of both the number of sites to be closed and the size of the fences, some positive effects have been achieved in only a few years: a decrease in sand accumulation and rock erosion, as well as in vehicle and human trampling in and around sites (see Bahn 2009 contra di Lernia 2009). A series of portacabins is currently (as to January 201 1) being established in the region, in order to better regulate the access to the main wadis and to patrol the principal rock art sites. Discussion and possible actions The examination of all this data allows some pre- liminary observations and suggests a series of actions. Detailed analyses for each single wadi, not undertaken here, may represent a further step towards the improved management of individual areas, especially within a general revision of the property status (i.e., the estab- lishment of a National Park). Overall, the Tadrart Akakus is clearly endangered and, unless specific measures are taken, the increasing threats may be devastating for this area. It is therefore necessary to safeguard and preserve this unique herit- age, whilst simultaneously increasing the communica- tion between and with all parties involved. Cooperation is the key to achieving results: scholars, local bodies, international organisations, communities, and indi- vidual visitors must all play an active role. Safeguard is not a possible outcome without knowledge, which implies an appreciation and awareness of the outstand- ing universal value of this heritage. As already proposed (Liverani et al. 2000), one useful measure would be to limit access to the mas- sif. Today, thanks to an in-depth territorial and GIS analysis of rock art features, the identification of areas to be subject to zoning restrictions can be identified on a firmer basis. In our view, the influx of tourists should be channelled towards two main areas, following an important reassessment of site facilities and a proper restoration programme. These zones are: i) part of the Awis area; and ii) wadi Teshuinat. More specifically, the Awis has a high density of sites, mainly engravings, representative of almost all the various rock art styles (except Wild Fauna), in a good state of preservation, and with a high degree of signifi- cance. The restoration of some artworks, in particular several paintings in the Horse/Bitriangular style, and the presence of adequate facilities to inform visitors and to keep them at a distance from the art and from the archaeological floor deposit are the main measures to be implemented. The area is easily accessible and already hosts some important tourist facilities (camp sites, water, etc.); this further justifies its inclusion among the areas with high human impact. The case of wadi Teshuinat is singular: it has a high density of sites (with the exception of Wild Fauna, all styles, engraved and painted, are represented here), 172 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 9 (2), 2011</page><page sequence="15">Working in a UNESCO WH Site associated with the highest significance values. The rock art sites here had the highest values for both good and poor degrees of preservation. This wadi hosts a large number of masterpieces and therefore continues to attract researchers, amateurs and tourists. Scientists have damaged some rock art contexts by applying ill- conceived methods, such as wetting, to improve the visibility of paintings (di Lernia 2008: 40). Teshuinat is still the most commonly frequented wadi for both local and foreign visitors; they have repeatedly wetted, scratched and even looted the rock art features. It is no coincidence that the highest density of artworks in a poor state of preservation belongs to the Pastoral style, the most famous and recognisable even to the inexpert visi- tor. Along the course of the wadi, several rock art sites are associated with rich archaeological deposits, some excavated by the Italian-Libyan Mission between the 1960s and 1990s. These interventions provided the key data for reconstructing a detailed picture of Holocene Saharan human populations, at the same time irreparably damaging the sites themselves. Sadly, the Teshuinat area has been sacrificed to science and tourism, but measures such as those proposed for the Awis area could help to better safeguard the remaining features. As for the rest of the massif, intensive restoration projects could be undertaken in the most vulnerable wadis; more specifically, a joint project by international scholars guided by ICOMOS is the only possible way to rescue wadi Senaddar, the area most affected by recent acts of vandalism (di Lernia et al 2010). Furthermore, a pilot project to monitor rock art could be proposed for several areas like wadi Rahmellen and wadi Agmir, where the generally good state of preservation of both engravings and paintings in all the different styles makes them suitable for a long-term monitoring project - transforming these areas in the most important conser- vation zone in the Tadrart Akakus. Towards the Tadrart Akakus as a cultural landscape Admittedly, the nature of Tadrart Akakus rock art is multifaceted: an interconnected history of climate changes, cultural dynamics, social and ideological be- liefs that cannot be tackled without a multi-dimensional approach. A long-lasting tradition of research and a combina- tion of innovative technologies lie behind today's new awareness of Tadrart Akakus rock art. The fieldwork and GIS analysis clearly indicate the need to take im- mediate steps to manage the area and safeguard this immense heritage. We suggest a twofold strategy to be implemented by the Libyan authorities and if possible by international institutions such as UNESCO. The basic level is the creation of a National Park with a management plan, the outcome of a shared agreement between all the parties involved, and the establishment of a system of conservation-trained and licensed guides, drivers and wardens. It is evident that although access to the Tadrart Akakus archaeological sites is already subject to Libyan law (especially law 3/1424), this is insufficient unless the police in charge of supervising visitors is adequately trained. We have shown, on the basis of territorial re- search and GIS analysis, that rock art features are unevenly distributed through the Tadrart Akakus and the same applies to their state of preservation. Differentiated measures are thus needed. First, the zoning of the massif, allowing tourists access to two selected wadis (Awis and Teshuinat), even if the option of closing or limiting access to the most fragile or damaged sites must be always taken into consideration. Second, the development of specific projects for the intensive restoration of the most dam- aged sites, and the definition of monitoring projects for the best preserved areas. Though a specific legal framework is still lacking, these guidelines may help to develop a new policy for heritage administration and management. The Tadrart Akakus, however, is not just rock art. As briefly mentioned in this paper, the cultural and natural heritage of the region is broader and includes an immense natural, archaeological, historical and ethnographic heritage that requires protection and dissemination. The recording of all these features, their assessment and administration in the context of a general management plan may be a fundamental step towards proposing that UNESCO modify the criteria used to justify the area's inclusion on the World Heritage List, moving towards a recognition of the region as a diffuse Cultural landscape (di Lernia 2008).
