Known best as a mathematician, father of Andrey Bely, and teacher of Pavel Florensky, Bugaev also wrote philo sophical articles treating the arrangement of human knowledge and intellectual activity and the structure of being and consciousness. An examination of Bugaev's philosophical work sheds light not only on these questions, but also on the peculiar character of "background" figures and works in intellectual history. Keywords Bugaev, Russian intellectual history, monad, Leibniz, philosophy, mathematics, discontinuity In the history of thought there are people who found schools, attract follow ers, publish important works, and get chapters and even books written about them.1 We call these people "prominent," by which we suggest that they occupy a kind of foreground in our picture of intellectual history. Others come to us through hearsay, in the recollections of better-known writers, in the inspira tion they imparted to the people around them, in the generosity with which they helped their friends and students, and in the phantom force of their ideas channeled through pens held by other hands. These people remain in the background of history. Nikolai Vasilievich Bugaev (1837-1903) occupies both positions. Mathe maticians know him as a founding member of the Moscow Mathematical Society2, a prolific scholar, the teacher of mathematicians prominent in their " This article has benefited from the encouragement and suggestions of Gennady Barabtarlo, Robert Bird, Steven Cassedy, Caryl Emerson, Michael Gordin, Yuri Latushkin, Peter Thomas, Justin Weir, and two anonymous referees reading for RH. 2&gt; See P.A.

However, this paper is concerned with Bugaev as a philosophical thinker, and there he is nearly a paradigm case of the background figure: respected by his contemporaries, fertile in his thought, but without a fully realized body of work to attract much attention. Upon Bugaev's death in 1904, Lev Lopatin wrote that Bugaev's metaphysics had about it "much that is subjective and insufficiently elaborated," but that there was "also something that will long outlive him."4 V. V. Zenkovsky gave an almost identical assess ment half a century later. "Unfortunately all of [his] views are expressed in very brief form; but, despite this fact, Bugayev's ideas deserve the most serious consideration."5 As it happens, the serious consideration of these ideas has generally remained secondary to the elucidation of Bugaev's connections with, similarities to, or influences on a great number of better-known writers6. That is, of course, the natural way to think about something in the background: to ask first of all how it relates to the figures in the foreground. The foreground of philosophi cal debate during Bugaev's time was occupied by questions of and (especially) 31 For a brief account of Bugaev's work in mathematics, see E. P. Ozhigova, with A. P.

These will all receive some treatment below.Yet it is also possible to look directly at a back ground, as both Lopatin and Zenkovsky seem to urge, and Bugaev's slender body of philosophical writing repays the effort of attention in at least three ways: it is interesting and even provocative in its own right; it clarifies and to some degree epitomizes the Russian intellectual climate of the late nineteenth century; and it illuminates many aspects of Russian thought since that time. Bugaev was an active member of the Moscow Psychological Society, the lead ing center of philosophical thought in the last decades of the nineteenth cen tury. His influence on his philosophical contemporaries and on subsequent generations was significant. And—what is our main focus here—he offers a model of thought that is capacious yet disciplined, ambitious yet modest, and conscientious yet surprisingly imaginative. This paper is an attempt to look directly at it, and to describe and explain it. Individual Works Bugaev's themes emerge gradually from work to work, and some must be inferred from all the writings considered together, as the record of certain habits of thought and the premises behind them. As those writings are unlikely to be familiar to most readers, I will summarize them below. This paper will consider the works that Bugaev composed for a general audience and will leave aside the many pieces Bugaev devoted to technical mathematical topics, belonging as they do to the history of mathematics (where he is already known). However, Bugaev occasionally wrote about mathematics for a general audi ence, and he also sometimes amplified his technical works with broader obser vations. I will include some such cases among the general synopses below. "Des Mathematiques, considiries comme instrument scientifique etpedagogique" (1869/ This piece originated as a speech Bugaev delivered in 1869; it was published in 1872 by Gauthier-Villar (Paris). It is basically a wide-ranging, even eclecti cargument in favor of the central importance of mathematics in modern 71 Nikolai Vasilievich Bugaev, "Des Mathematiques, considerees comme instrument scientifique et pedagogique," trans. M. L. L. (Paris: Gauthier-Villars,1872).</page><page sequence="4">178 Т. Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175-198 intellectual life. Bugaev's comments range from the history of thought to the modern formation of academic specialization, from theory to practice, and from natural to social sciences. But the main point comes right at the begin ning: the university is (correctly) given over to the interaction of a multitude of points of view, no one of which can claim exclusive command of the truth. Distinct as they are, these points of view require a common language or medium of exchange, and both history and contemporary practice show that mathematics best serves this purpose. Bugaev's view of the university, as a forum for the interaction of diverse (but presumably rigorous and informed) points of view, offers a glimpse of what will become one of his major philosophical preoccupations: a non-extremist perspectivalism in which mutual influence and enrichment is possible.8 This preoccupation helps explain Bugaev's modifications of Leibniz's monadology in what is Bugaev's best-known philosophical work (see below). The Theory of Numerical Derivatives (1870-73f This is the most technical work that will be considered here, and its technical part (the vast bulk of it, an investigation of numerical functions) is not our focus. But in the conclusion, Bugaev describes the mathematical concept that will turn out to be crucial for his philosophical views and those of his followers-—in particular Pavel Florensky, who studied mathematics with him.10 A few other interesting features of Bugaev's thought also emerge in it. 81 S. S. Demidov characterizes Bugaev as attempting "to understand any phenomenon in all its fullness, not to reduce its apparent contradictions to a common denominator, but rather to view them as mutually supplementary, in their aggregate defining a whole."

I0) See Pavel Florensky, The Pillar and Ground of the Truth, trans. Boris Jakim (Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 1997), for example p. 136, where he insists on the importance ofpreryvnost' (dis continuity), the same word Bugaev uses to characterize the kind of functions he's interested in. For a stimulating discussion of this aspect of Florensky's thought, see Steven Cassedy, "The Shape of Russian Idealism: From Kant and Hegel to Dostoevsy to the Russian Religious Renaissance," in Cold Fusion: Aspects of the German cultural presence in Russia, ed. Gennady Barabtarlo (New York: Berghahn, 2000), 137-152. (Cassedy translates preryvnost' as "interruptedness.") Both Kaukhchishvili and (especially) Kaidzava discuss the importance of Bugaev's discontinuous func tions for Florensky. Thomas Seifrid also mentions this point: see his The Word Made Self: Russian Writings on Language, 1860-1930 (Ithaca: Cornell UP, 2005), 85.</page><page sequence="5">Т. Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175-198 179 Bugaev defines "numerical functions" (he will also call them "arithmetic functions" and "discontinuous functions") as functions whose value changes discontinuously, or in jumps, as the independent variable changes. The volume of a cylinder (to take his example) is a continuous function of its radius and height. Change one of those a little and the volume also changes a little. Change it a little more, and the volume changes a little more. However, as you gradually change the radius, the number of balls (of a given dimension) that you could fit into the cylinder might not change at all, and then suddenly leap. This jumpiness is the hallmark of discontinuous functions, and it makes them 1) more difficult and quirky than continuous functions, and 2) relevant to many real-world phenomena that the analytic mathematics of continuous functions cannot adequately treat. This latter claim will become central to Bugaev's philosophical views. Bugaev closes by defining mathematics as the study of functions, all of which belong to mathematics whether they generate numbers or other symbols. This view of mathematics, which was not universal at the time, shows Bugaev's tendency to abstraction, formalism, and a set of habits and assumptions typical of what would later come to be known as structuralism. "On the Question of Free Will" (1889)u This article appeared in an anthology of essays treating the problem of free will, put out by the Moscow Psychological Society in 1889. Free will was a particularly captivating problem in the second half of the nineteenth century, with strongly deterministic positions set against religious and then against philosophically based (often neo-Kantian or neo-Hegelian) defenses of free dom. Though this volume embodies the latter perspective, and Bugaev shares the belief in free will, his tone could not be further from that of idealist phi losophy. He begins with definitions, though of a peculiar, somewhat indirect sort: he enumerates, subdivides, and to some extent explains the conditions necessary to the exercise of will and then does the same for freedom. The point of the argument is that freedom requires for its manifestation the very same conditions required for the manifestation of will. The only difference lies in whether we're focusing on motivation (in which case we're talking about will) or on the absence of insurmountable obstacles (then we're talking about 111 Nikolai Vasilievich Bugaev, "Po voprosu о svobode voli," in О svobode voli: Trudy Moskovskogo Psikhologicheskoi Obshchestva, III (Moscow: Tip. A. Gattsuka, 1889), 195-218.</page><page sequence="6">180 Т. Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175-198 freedom). Both qualities require both kinds of precondition, and in each case we're dealing with degrees rather than absolutes. In other words, Bugaev treats will and freedom with pragmatic attention to their requirements rather than with ontological or axiomatic premises12. A genuine systematic, abstract inquiry into free will as such would require a thoroughgoing examination of determinism, and in particular of the related question of whether and in what respects individuals (the beings that exercise free will) are real units—in some sense, whether there is any such thing, onto logically, as an individual. That, he believes, is a transcendental question best suspended when we discuss our actions and volitions. The very definition of a unit, it would seem, has distracting metaphysical consequences. It is more morally practical and beneficial, then, to talk about autonomy (as Bugaev has apparently been doing) than about free will as such. However, the question about units does seem sort of captivating, or must have been to him, and there follows a five-page exploration of the topic. All complex forces, he says, are syntheses of simple forces, and every force has some effect on the world. Man is one of these forces, and there is a mutual effect of man on world and world on man. Further, the world can be seen as an individuum, while man can be seen as a whole world. Bugaev gives no indication of what this scalability of unit-hood or individuality does to the simple/complex dichotomy, and indeed the entire digression is not particu larly germane to Bugaev's point about autonomy (he has to wrestle it back on track rather abruptly). It would therefore seem to have simply been on his mind at the time. Sure enough, the nature of units became the topic of his next philosophical article. "Basic Principles of Evolutionary Monadology" (1893)li This is Bugaev's best-known philosophical work and the one where metaphys ics and mathematics—or rather, certain mathematical habits of thought, as it 121 For an intriguing discussion of pragmatism and the Moscow Psychological Society, see Randall A.

Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175-198 181 seems to me—combine in the most interesting and provocative way. After a compound apology for the lack of 1) full explanation, 2) reference to other philosophical systems, and 3) color or imagery, Bugaev proceeds to his defini tions. A "monad" is a "living unit," and "living" means "possessing potential psychic content." A "unit" is something that does not change in certain rela tionships and when some other things do change. On the other hand, monads do change according to an "inner motive"; that is the psychic content that defines them as "living." The relevant changes for a given monad involve other monads, and these changes are determined partly by the monads' "inner motives" and partly according to laws or conditions not fully accessible to the individual monad s understanding. The most important characteristics here are what Bugaev calls "order" and "relations." In the first case, we have what appears to be a straight forward hierarchy: monads of the first order subsume monads of the second order, which subsume those of the third, and so forth. Another way to label these entities is as "submonad" (say, a cell, to take Bugaev's example), "monad" (a human being), and "supramonad" (a nation or state). Bugaev notes that 1) the series may extend indefinitely in either direction, so that each monad is a supramonad with respect to the elements below it and a submonad to those above, and 2) monads of one order are qualitatively dissimilar to monads of a different order. We might retrospectively interpret his universe/man idea from the "Free Will" essay as an example of orders of monads: from one point of view, "man" is a "universe" (read "supramonad") subsuming many smaller units; from another, the universe is an "individuum" (read "monad") possessing cer tain traits (say, obedience to physical laws and perhaps a certain quantity of matter and energy) that do not vary, and thus possessing a certain unity or unit-hood. However, Bugaev's main focus is on relations where we reckon not by "sub" or "supra" but rather by "simple" and "complex." The "complex" monad, like the supramonad, is a set of monads—but unlike a supramonad, a complex monad is qualitatively homogeneous with its constituent parts. Bugaev's example here is a family. Rather than elucidating the example, though, Bugaev apologizes for it: it's only symbolic, he says. It's not obvious to this reader in what sense a family is similar to its constituent parts, when a nation is not similar to its parts. It may be that we're talking about nuclear and extended families here, in which case the former are "simple" and the latter "complex," but they are all kinship groups and thus qualitatively homogeneous. Alternatively, there may be a conception of "family" that we could call "Tolstoyan," in which families seem to possess some of the characteristics typically associated with individuals.</page><page sequence="8">182 Т. Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175-198 In any case, the abstract notion ("complex" versus "simple" monad) seems easier to understand than the example introduced to clarify it, and Bugaev's readers may have been grateful, notwithstanding his introductory apology, that he spared them further illustration. The "world process" can be viewed as the process of formation and disinte gration of complex monads. The bulk of the article is devoted to a description of this process; fundamental to the whole thing is a notion of improvement, indicated in Bugaev's title by the word "evolutionary" (which, this being 1893, still had strong connotations of "progress") and in the text by the spatial adverb "upward." Here Bugaev offers two fundamental (and seemingly complemen tary) principles: "inertia," which means that a monad cannot change itself fully by its own isolated action, and "solidarity," which means that monads develop in certain aspects only by entering into relation with other monads. Having described the rules and varieties of these relations in some detail, Bugaev gets to his large-scale claims. The monodological view (his) reconciles such apparently opposed principles as "science and history, spirit and matter, pantheism and individualism, freedom and necessity."14 The physical laws of nature are simply the "primordial customs or habits of the monads."15 The world "is a collection of a large number of simple and complex monads."16 And Man, finally, is "a living shrine in which the highest aims and most impor tant task of the worlds life are actively realized."17 "Mathematics and the Scientific-Philosophical Worldvieiv" (1898)xi Sozertsanie is "contemplation," and the second part of Bugaev's title might more accurately, albeit cumbersomely, be translated as "the scientific-philosophical way of looking at the world." Bugaev's focus is on the process and procedures of looking, rather than on what is seen (and still less on one's opinions, another sense of "worldview"). In this article Bugaev returns to the subject of mathe matics and its place in the world of human thought. Little here is entirely new, but Bugaev's claims are clearer and more forceful than in his earlier work. 141 "Εν. Mon" section 119: page 38 in the Russian text and 139 in the English.

Langen I Russian History 38 (2011) 175-198 183 Science is the basis for the way modern people see the world, and sci ence requires measurement, and thus quantification, and thus mathematics. However, mathematics is not limited to studying quantities, but more gener ally treats similarities and differences in change. It is thus the science of functions. Functions come in two basic types: continuous and discontinuous. These are manipulated by the techniques (respectively) of analytic calculus and what Bugaev has called "arithmology," the field to which he devoted so much of his mathematical research (see the section on the Theory of Numerical Derivatives, above). Add geometry and probability, and you've got the full mathematical picture. The habits of thought of a given age are both enabled and limited by the mathematics available at the time. The ancient world saw the development of geometry, which informed both its scientific and its philosophical worldview. The discovery/invention of analytic calculus in the early modern era opened vast new fields to scientific study, but it also led to certain philosophical distor tions which persist through to the present (that is, 1898). The analytic sup position of continuity has encouraged too much confidence in the continuity of natural phenomena and thus in the predictability (and retrodictability) of events. In its worst overextensions, this way of thinking leads to runaway claims of causality, a mood of fatalism, and denial of the possibility of freedom. Arithmology, dealing as it does with discontinuous functions, can correct this imbalance. Jumps seem to correspond, at least intuitively, with non-predictability, freedom, and perhaps mystery. As a mathematician, Bugaev wants to subject such jumps to the reign of rational thought, and his contribu tion was to show and extend how far this can be done. But as a philosophical thinker discussing ways of viewing the world, he appears to see the reality of discontinuous functions as a check on the confidence of modern rationalizing thought and even as a corrective to what we might think of as a positivist Gestalt. When you construct an abstract mental view of the universe, it seems that you should sever many of your long causal and predictive lines and make the whole thing a little jumpier. Bugaev s Questions: Mathematics, Units, Metaphysics, Reconciliation While Bugaev writes clearly and sometimes even engagingly, it is often hard to figure out exactly what he's trying to accomplish, or what question he's trying to answer. We can understand and provisionally accept that a monad is a living unit or that mathematics is the study of change without having any idea where</page><page sequence="10">184 Т. Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175-198 we're going or why we need the distinctions. It is as if Descartes had begun his discourse immediately with "I think therefore I am," not bothering to indicate why one might need such an affirmation. In this sense, too, Bugaev creates backgrounds when he writes: intricate patterns that tend to lack a strong ori enting focal point. However, there is one question that he clearly does address, and one where his philosophically-minded contemporaries would have turned to him as an expert: What is the full and proper role of mathematics in human knowledge? With the modern world so obviously and increasingly dependent on the sort of science and technology (and ultimately mathematics) that are beyond the grasp of even a well-educated non-specialist, a philosophically interested mathematician like Bugaev would seem to be in a position to offer valuable description, explanation, and insight. This is indeed what he tried to do every time he wrote about mathematics for the non-specialist (and in certain cases when he was writing for specialists, as at the end of the book on numerical functions): to describe the discipline in certain fundamental terms, to draw attention to a few unfamiliar but significant areas, and especially to explain the importance of mathematics for the rest of life/thought/world. Yet mathematics, perhaps because it was Bugaevs area of expertise, is also where he was something of a partisan—partial, that is, to discontinuous func tions. This feature comes through clearest in "Mathematics and the Scientific Philosophical Worldview," and it is evident not in any polemical tone but in the order of events: define the modern world view, narrow to mathematics, narrow to functions, narrow to continuous versus discontinuous functions, and then proceed. Thus by a short and orderly process Bugaev moves from the very general (contemporary thought) to his particular hobby horse, discon tinuous functions and their under-recognized importance. Modern thought, it seems, has a special connection not merely to mathematics in general, but to the mathematics of discontinuity. Bugaevs sense of the world as not maxi mally continuous leads naturally to a second (compound) question: What is the proper way to divide up our experiences of the world and our thoughts about it (and about our experience), and what are the relationships among the resulting categories? As we have seen, this question is at the center of Bugaevs best-known philo sophical work, "Evolutionary Monadology." Best-known and strangest: one is</page><page sequence="11">Т. Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175-198 185 tempted to read it anachronistically as a prologue to his sons extravagant and deliberate attempts at myth-building. It all starts with monads, which enter into various relations the highest of which is love, and by their interactions they raise one another into higher states of being. Lopatin understates the matter when he criticizes Bugaev for anthropomorphism." If only it stopped there! Really these spirit-creatures are not very far from centaurs and firebirds or Chaos and Gaia. Bugaev's choice of title deliberately invokes the Monadology of Gottfried Leibniz, who used "monad" to refer to simple elements of which everything else was made up. Thus the seemingly pedantic question of con nection and separation—near neighbor to the pedantry of definition—rapidly leads Bugaev to esoteric realms. However, this brings us to another question about Bugaev's questions. Does he really take all this stuff seriously? Is he trying to persuade his reader that the world really is composed of monads and monadic clumps of monads, forever clumping and unclumping, self-realizing and self-annihilating? Is he saying that the world might be this way? That it could! What is the mood of his claim? Or is it no claim at all, but a figure for contemplation, like Pierre's globe dream in War and Peace? The best way to interpret Bugaev's article, it seems to me, is as an answer—certainly a quirky, even weird answer—to the question: What would a rational and comprehensive metaphysical system look like? Bugaev does not offer the familiar, epistemologically conscientious sort of metaphysics that worries whether it should even exist, the sort that often expends its energy in prefaces, prolegomenae, and Grundwerke. Bugaev had a day job, after all, and he could hardly afford the time for such preliminary formalities. He is in this regard an exception to the trend of academic speciali zation and professionalization that characterized Russian philosophy (and many other subjects) in the late nineteenth century. Nor does he say why these monads behave the way they do; he simply reports how things are, like a natu ralist visiting a plane of being so high or deep or noumenal that it is composed entirely of abstractions. And yet of course he has not seen them directly, any more than Leibniz saw his monads. In the absence of argumentation, explana tion, or evidence, what Bugaev seems to be offering is the possibility of a meta physics, the rhythms of a metaphysics, the DNA (anachronistically speaking) of a metaphysics. If he had strained his mind long enough in search of those colorful elaborations whose absence he himself bemoans, he would likely have 191 Lopatin 280.</page><page sequence="12">186 Т. Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175—198 concluded that no such positive content can be described. What he is trying to give, I think, is a grammar of being. He leaves it to his readers to fill in the words. This was perhaps a way for him to use his position as an outsider, or at least a generalist, to make a contribution to the increasingly specialized disci pline of philosophy. If we allow ourselves to get even more abstract, to move "upward," as Bugaev might say (or even urge), we can see all these questions as variations on a single question, which seems to me to have been the most pervasive and compelling one for Bugaev: Can fundamental oppositions (among people, practices, opinions, principles...) be recon ciled, and if so, how? This is the one question that all of Bugaev's philosophical works seem to share, and the answer is always: yes, if your thinking is clear. In his early lecture on mathematics, Bugaev describes math as a mediator, both between theoretical and practical education and among various disci plines.20 Math serves another mediating role in his last philosophical essay— that is, it can save positive scientific (or systematic, or formalized) knowledge from widespread and well-founded objections to its excesses. This problem— which can be understood in general terms as the dispute over positivism— occupied a prominent place in Russian intellectual discourse for a period stretching from the 1860s well into the twentieth century. What is distinctive about the 1890s is how many people, Bugaev prominent among them, tried to solve the problem in a meliorating, technical way. Earlier in the debate, Dostoevsky, Chernyshevsky, and Sechenev had polarized their claims, pitting a rational against an intuitive system (or variations of this opposition), and raising the stakes to cataclysmic levels. Bugaev is more modest in his approach. Overambitious quantitative types have distorted the human and to some extent the natural sciences, he implies, not because of an inherent flaw in the project of quantitative knowledge, but simply because they have not under stood their tools—numbers—well enough. Solve that problem correctly and you'll have nothing to fear from the scientists. The whole motivation of Bugaev's essay on free will, it seems to me, is to remove irreconcilable contradictions from the topic. This is accomplished by 1) reducing freedom and will to variations of the same thing, requiring the 20) Bugaev "Des Mathematiques" 10.</page><page sequence="13">Т. Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175-198 187 same preconditions, so that there can be no inherent contradiction between will and freedom, and 2) simply ruling out a thoroughgoing theoretical dis cussion of the matter, which is where the insoluble problems might arise. Yet as we have seen, he could not leave the problem alone, and "Evolutionary Monadology" is where he tries to solve it. What Bugaev is trying to give us here, or almost giving us, or moving towards giving us, is a rigorous system that reconciles certain basic conflicts or antinomies in our experience or thought—such oppositions as inner versus outer, subject vs. object, determin ism vs. probability, also determinism vs. freedom, and living vs. non-living— without resolving them in favor of one element or the other. These are all terms that appear in Bugaev's essay, though not lined up like that. To the extent that these antinomies represent limits or impasses in human thought, their reconciliation would be an enormous achievement. Bugaev's reconciliation typically takes the form of compromise, which in itself is hardly an innovation. Yet the consequences are sometimes surprising. During the course of their evolution, monads perform actions, which eventu ally cluster into habits, and then customs, and then eventually laws. The sim plest monads are also the oldest and thus the furthest evolved and the most self-consistent, and their customs are known as the laws of nature. Newer and more complex monads are still at the stage of custom or habit; they are some how not yet fully themselves. Their actions still have a random element to them; here we can speak only of likelihood. Determinism and probability are thus not at all opposed principles, but merely different stages of monadic evolution. Similarly, every monad is living in the sense that it has a kind of inferiority and that it performs purposeful work. The ones that have evolved toward greater complexity have become more life-like in a sense that we would recog nize. Henri Bergson would have recognized it too: his opposition between organic and inorganic matter depends on something almost exactly like what Bugaev says about complex monads: they somehow carry with them the mem ory of the complexes or organisms with which they have been associated in the past.21 I'm not aware of anything Bugaev could have read by Bergson with this idea in it before he wrote the "Evolutionary Monadology," but in any case both men were clearly affected by the early development of evolutionary biol ogy and the attempts to think through its implications. However, for Bugaev, 2" Bergson, Henri (1944). Creative Evolution. Tr. Arthur Mitchell. New York: Modern Library.</page><page sequence="14">188 Т. Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175—198 the distinction between organic and inorganic is quite provisional and mainly a matter of degree. In this respect, Bugaevs thought is closest to the Russian panpsychists Aleksei Kozlov, Lev Lopatin, and Nikolai Losskii.22 When he defines a monad as being characterized by "potential psychic content,"23 he indicates his agree ment with their fundamental view of existence. However, Bugaev differs in emphasis from those writers. The main work of "Ev. Mon.," as of his other philosophical writings, is not to plead fundamental qualities but to show the nature and results of their interactions. Bugaev's monadic evolution claims prodigious powers of reconciliation. The development of highly complex monads also tends to resolve or at least soften the opposition between inside and outside. Complexity for him is really what we might call self-similarity: the quality by which parts resemble the whole. As this quality is intensified, the inside of the monad starts to be pretty much the same thing as the outside. Problem solved. Or not, as the reader may think. Perhaps one prefers the formulation in "Mathematics and the Scientific-Philosophical Worldview," where continuous and discontinuous functions constitute a mathematical antinomy—which, however, can and should result in "harmony" rather than "contradiction"; the opposition between them (and within other similar pairs) should be seen not as a cacophony but as a "vital pulse."24 The figure of "pulse" is hardly convinc ing: a pulse "reconciles" systolic and diastolic values simply by having the two of them alternate through time: systolic-diastolic-systolic-diastolic. A corre sponding practice in music, say tenor-soprano-tenor-soprano, could scarcely be considered "harmony," and determinism-freedom-determinism-freedom is not likely to satisfy many philosophers as a solution to that antinomy. But Bugaev is waxing metaphorical, from which I infer that he wants to solve the problem, wants to in the worst way, and so it is not surprising that it is pre cisely here, at his most compulsive, that he abandons his customary rigor. It is also where he most resembles his son, who shared the drive to reconcile oppo sites but whose approach was far more ecumenical and less embarrassed in its mixture of logical argumentation, number-crunching, and metaphor. 22) For an introduction to these thinkers, see James P.

Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175-198 189 Bugaev's Key Notions: Discontinuity, Evolution, Field Major figures in the history of philosophy tend to generate their own labels (Platonic, Hegelian, etc.); minor ones like Bugaev are typically labeled as a way of situating them among more recognizable landmarks. The most obvious label for him is "mathematician," which, however, indicates very little about the content of his thought. In fact, I will claim below that mathematics had important implications for the style of his thought, but he is not prima rily some sort "mathematicist" philosopher defending his turf against "anti mathematicist" ones. However, there was a polarized field of that sort in late nineteenth century Russian philosophy: positivist vs. anti-positivist. Lopatin, in his excellent obit uary of Bugaev, feels compelled to indicate Bugaev's position within this dis pute: positivist at first, then anti-positivist or at least more guarded against the claims of positivism, later in life. It seems to me that Loptin's characterization is not unfair; however, Bugaev is not a philosophical polemicist, and the dispute over positivism seems to have been important to him more as an inspi ration to think systematically about determinism, causality, and the proce dures of human knowledge, than a field of combat where he wanted to prevail over opponents. (For an opposing view on this point, the reader might consult N. F. Utkina, who treats Bugaev's arithmology as simply a vehicle for con servative and mystical thought.)25 Bugaev, Lopatin, and several other philosophers have been labeled "neo Leibnizean" (they can be found under that heading in Zenkovsky's History of Russian Philosophy, for example). "Leibnizean" is certainly a label Bugaev brings on himself when he calls his metaphysical system a "monadology." However, the neoLeibnizeans generally, and Bugaev in particular, borrow very selectively from Leibniz—monads seem to be the main thing, along, perhaps, with cer tain attitudes toward causality—and even in the case of monads we cannot speak of fidelity to a master. Leibniz remarked famously that monads have no windows26: they cannot be acted upon by anything less than divinity itself. The Russian neo-Leibnizeans rejected this fundamental principle; they all build windows into their monads. Incidentally, the Russians were not alone in this: Leibniz's fundamental conception—the unitary, indivisible monad— 251 Ν. F. Utkina, Pozitivizm, antropologicheskii materialism i пайка υ Rossii (vtoraia polovina XIX veka) (Moscow, Nauka: 1975) 144-45. 261 In section 7 of his (Leibniz's) Monadology.</page><page sequence="16">190 Т. Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175-198 seems to be appealing in direct proportion to its intolerability: people who take up his system immediately invent ways that monads are divisible, subject to outside influence, etc. Deleuze's "two-story" monads are the most familiar recent example.27 In any case, Leibniz, positivism pro and contra, and mathematics, while important components of Bugaev's intellectual environment, are not adequate descriptions or explanations of his thought. For that purpose, I'd like to call attention to three notions that really do seem to guide much of his thinking. Discontinuity This is the explicit theme of many of Bugaev's remarks and probably the most important aspect of his philosophy. In addition to what I have already described28, it may be worth noting two additional points. First, Bugaev was not alone in this preoccupation: many of the distinctive features of early twentieth century thought and art involve a transition from continuity to discontinuity as a basic principle of perception and representation29. Second, for Bugaev discontinuity in mathematics seems not only to show the way to various kinds of philosophical reconciliation, but also to provide mathematics with a certain individual sort of charm. He characterizes the truths of analysis (continuity-based math) as "universal" and those of arithmology as peculiar (svoeobraznye), mysterious, and beautiful. He says that this is what explains the mystical properties that have been attributed to whole numbers.30 On the other hand, that charm is not always readily apparent to the non mathematician. In "Mathematics and the Scientific-Philosophical Worldview," Bugaev seems to have chosen an uphill struggle, insofar as he wants to bring a very difficult, non-intuitive branch of mathematics into what he calls the "scientific-philosophical worldview." Such a worldview, non-technical with regards to mathematics, must necessarily rely on a kind of mathematical intui tion, and this is relatively easy in the case of geometry, probability, and 271 Gilles Deleuze, The Fold: Leibniz and the Baroque, trans. Tom Conley (Minneapolis: U of Minnesota P, 1993). 281 See sections on The Theory of Numerical Derivatives and "Mathematics and the Scientific Philosophical Worldview." 2,) For a fascinating survey of this theme, see William R. Everdell, The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought (Chicago: U of Chicago Ρ 1997). 301 Bugaev "Matematika..." 701.</page><page sequence="17">Т. Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175-198 191 analytic calculus. Even if you don't know the first thing about differentiation, you can look at a curve and imagine that at each point it has a slope, and that the slope shifts smoothly from point to point. This is not a precise way of thinking, but rather a general sense of how values can change. Similarly, you can, without knowing anything about standard deviations, accept that a chart plotting the height of an arbitrarily large number of European men will dis play very high frequency at a certain value (say, around 175 cm.) and dimin ishing frequency in both directions out from there. The data points on the chart will suggest a pattern to the eye, and the mind will be nudged toward a probabilistic model of the universe as more and more kinds of data are charted. This oversimplification poses its own serious risks, but as an enabling figure for a worldview it has at least the virtue of being visualizable—a virtue shared, of course, by geometry as well. But what about arithmology?31 It has, in certain respects (especially group theory, about which more below), provided remarkably useful tools for mod eling quantum phenomena and crystals, for example. However, it resists visu alization, and Bugaev does not, in 1898, try to make it visualizable. Instead his main point is that it is a coherent, systematic mathematical technique that does not imply the sort of runaway determinism the model of calculus might inspire. He may be right, but it's also not surprising that the world's worldview didn't take much notice. There's just not enough to view. Incidentally, here Bugaev's famous son not only follows his fathers way of thinking, but even contributes something to it. In several articles32, Andrey Bely published analyses of verse rhythm that found and charted a hidden order in the jumpy phenomenon of pyrrhic feet in Russian verse. In his influential, quirky, and perhaps even charming way, Bely is really trying to do something like the arithmology of Russian verse, and he is trying to make it visual. Evolution Bugaev's metaphysics is not just a "monadology," but an "evolutionary monadology," though we must be careful not to read "Darwinian evolution" 311 Arithmology being a somewhat idiosyncratic term, we can think here of a body of techniques based on an analogy between operations in number theory to those of mathematical analysis, and applied in particular to discontinuous functions. 1 borrow this characterization from Demidov, "Ν. V. Bugaev i vozniknovenie..." 116. 321 See especially Andrey Bely, Simvolizm: Kniga statei (Moscow: Musaget, 1910) 175-428, and also Bely's Ritm как dialektika i "Mednyi Vsadnik" (Moscow: Federatsiia, 1929).</page><page sequence="18">192 Т. Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175-198 into his title. Despite some real similarities his meaning is quite different, discontinuity seeming to challenge rather than support an evolutionary theory that had not yet become "punctuated."33 For Bugaev, evolution seems to be linked with three crucial things: complexity, goal-directedness, and health. Complexity is a key idea for Bugaev; he is no primitivist. His dominant explanatory mode is to begin with simple elements and then describe their development or evolution into more complex entities. This obviously happens in "Evolutionary Monadology," but also to some extent in "Free Will" (where will and its component parts can be seen in their more primitive, simple state, but also in their development toward a broader, higher, more perfect form), and even in "Math and the SciPhi Worldview" (where mathematics itself is primitively or complexly understood; complex is better, or at least potentially better, and primitive is at any rate inadequate). Bugaev clearly believes in progress, at least intellectual and spiritual pro gress, and one of his recurrent concepts is tselesoobraznost', a word without a handy English equivalent but basically goal-directedness. There can, in other words, be good or bad complexity, sound or unsound elaboration, and Bugaev's apparently descriptive style has a distinctly prescriptive feel. In the back ground is the notion of health, something he does not discuss directly but which seems to inform his approach to every subject he touches: the proper care and feeding, and the normal (normative) behavior, of numbers, of motivations, of actions, of monads, of data, of concepts... the husbandry of thought. Field Bugaev is trying in "Evolutionary Monadology" to provide a field for philoso phy, possibly both in the general sense of the italicized term and also in some thing like a mathematical sense. He is trying to establish a space governed by an identifiable set of consistent rules that accommodate a number of lower order (or somehow narrower) functions. Those functions are philosophical systems, and by Bugaev's time they were in need of some unification. As varied in viewpoint and subject matter as nineteenth-century Russian philosophical thought had been, much of it seems to have flowed from a common preoc cupation with a few abstract points. These included: 331 See Alexander Vucinich, Darwin in Russian Thought (Berkeley: U of California P, 1988), 265 67.</page><page sequence="19">Т. Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175-198 193 - the relation of the individual (person, notion, action, whatever) to the whole(s) of which it was a part, - the existence (or non-existence), extent, fineness, and absolute or relative character of laws governing events as they occur through time, and - possibly the existence, and certainly the nature and relative force, of "inter naГ versus "externaF factors governing entities and events. When Westernizers, Slavophiles, Nihilists, Populists, and Bugaev's contem poraries expressed opinions regarding history, politics, religion, science, and most other matters, they also staked out positions vis-a-vis the points above. This may be a specific result of the Hegelian legacy in Russian thought, or it may be implicit in most philosophical thinking. Either way, those basic ques tions are typically on full display in Russian philosophy, and they are the site of radical disagreement. Bugaev, I think, is trying to define a space within which each totalizing assertion becomes a relative truth, and one with identifiable boundaries. This is clearly his idea in the early lecture on mathematics, where he appeals to the university as the place where diverse points of view come together, none of which has absolute command of the truth. The ideal task of the university is to bring all its disparate voices into some kind of harmony. It may not be going too far, then, to say that for Bugaev a university is a living philosophy; a philosophy, an abstracted university. The job of the math ematician, and the philosopher, and the public intellectual, and indeed the university administrator, is a kind of housekeeping: to provide and maintain a healthy environment for the interaction of living minds. Bugaev's Style of Thought The notions of field, health, and evolution, while central to Bugaev's thought and appealing in his use of them, are neither distinctive enough nor suffi ciently elaborated to establish him as a really identifiable, original presence in Russian philosophy. Discontinuity comes close, but he did not quite trans form it into something corresponding to the "sobornost'," "Godmanhood," "Sophiology," or "dialogism" of other Russian thinkers. It is not obvious that he would even have wanted to do that: to make his mark by insisting on a privileged element to the exclusion or detriment of others, to rally everything good behind a slogan. Even discontinuity in his writings (as distinct from some of Florensky's) is not an ontological skeleton key; it's just a useful and</page><page sequence="20">194 Т. Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175-198 powerful concept that corrects certain imbalances in the thought of his contemporaries. Here a paradoxical point emerges. You don't get famous—you don't even get many readers—by qualifying your claims, moderating your tone, trying to find some room for every point of view, and insisting on rigorously fair play among all of them. And yet those very habits may win you the deep respect of those few who do know you, and of those who chance to read your work with unhurried interest. Bugaev's style of thought, more than any particular con cept of his (and certainly more than any particular article), seems to be the mark he left on those around him and, in a quiet way, on Russian thought of the twentieth century. That style, while somewhat elusive (perhaps like any style), relies on three related habits: a consideration ofperspective, a reliance on explicit definition, and the use of transformations to find invariant elements. Perspective Bugaev is an eclectic thinker: he wants freedom and determination, spirit and matter, social and physical sciences. Right from the start of his career, as we have seen, he made a point of granting legitimacy to a multitude of perspec tives. This must have been one thing that attracted him to Leibniz, for whom each monad captures something of the whole of existence—but out of propor tion. Those things that are closest to the monad ("close" here implying not mere physical proximity but a kind of closeness of essences, closeness in an ideal order of forms) are represented more prominently in it, while distant things seems smaller.34 Thus, although Leibniz rules out interaction among monads, he arranges them in a kind of interrelation that we might call perspectivalism. Each monad is a distinct perspective on the world. For Bugaev, this perspectivalism extends even to the question of whether a given entity is or is not a monad. From one "perspective" (which we can now redefine as a set of relations with other mon ads), X may be a monad; from another perspective it may be a submonad, or supramonad, or a complex monad, or no monad at all. Here is what Bugaev says: By the expression "the monad is a unit," I mean, that it is defined by the sign, "perma nency." Permanency is indicative of its immutability in certain relationships. [...] It remains 341 Leibniz's mirror analogy: Monadology sections 56 through 63—see especially 57 for perspectivalism.</page><page sequence="21">Т. Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175—198 195 the same for our consciousness in certain aspects of its manifestation. The monad is an element.35 A monad is permanent, which means that it is immutable...in certain rela tionships; certain aspects of its manifestation remain the same for our con sciousness. It sounds as though Bugaev is hedging his bets. In fact, though, he is being consistent with the perspectivalism inherent in Leibniz's Monadology, and not claiming to have a transcendent viewpoint from which to claim "such and-such just is permanent and singular." More Leibnizean than Leibniz on this point, Bugaev seems willing to dispense with just about anything abso lute, and instead to make everything dependent on where you stand and how you're looking. Definition Bugaev's perspectivalism is not, however, the extreme, squishy, solipsistic vari ety: I'm entitled to my opinion and you can have yours, and each of us may be right in some way On the contrary, he seems to have been committed to the interaction of these perspectives, whether we think of them as monads or as academic disciplines. And the only way this can happen is if everyone under stands what everyone else is talking about. Bugaev's far more prominent son, Andrey Bely, tells a story in his memoire On the Border of Two Centuries, about a meeting of scholars at which one paper was devoted to the topic of animal intelligence. Bugaev interrupted to ask whether the presenter knew what intelligence itself was. As it transpired, nei ther the speaker nor any of the listeners could define intelligence, and so Bugaev, who was presiding, closed the proceedings for lack of topic36. At least he was no hypocrite: impatient with lecturers who could not define their terms, he began pretty much everything he wrote with a laborious definition of his. When discussing mathematics, he starts by defining mathematics (to varying degrees of technicality, depending on his audience). If his topic is free will, he devotes most of his space to definitions of will and of freedom. Monadology? Start by defining monads. 351 "Εν.

Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175—198 The last example offers an instructive contrast, since Bugaev's "Evolutionary Monadology" appeared in the same issue of Voprosy Filosofiii i Psikhologii as the fourth installment of Vladimir Solovyov's "The Meaning of Love."37 How would Bugaev have treated Solovyov's theme? In fact, it does arise near the end of "Evolutionary Monadology," but if he were to write a whole article on the topic, it's a safe bet he would have started by defining "meaning" and defining "love." Solovyov started his disquisition (a few issues earlier) in a completely different way, by disputing the notion that the sexual urge exists for the pur pose of species propagation. His starting point is thus 1) polemical, 2) coun terintuitive, and 3) titillating. Bugaev's is conscientiously...academic. He generates the kind of writing that can seem both willful and sterile, that appears to use tautologies and axioms to remove any room for differing opin ions—not with rhetorical intensity but with a methodical narrowing of pos sibilities, until only one is left. But this way of thinking, far from sterile, was especially fruitful during Bugaev's time, with the development of mathematical group theory and set theory. The former considerably enlarged the scope and power of mathematics by grouping mathematical phenomena formally, not by their evident applica tions in the physical or economic world but by the predictable changes they would or would not undergo during a specified operation. This means think ing in terms of "functions" rather than merely "numbers," and as we have seen, Bugaev insists on precisely that point. Set theory dramatically enriched math ematics by conceiving of the entire enterprise in terms of collections of ele ments. With the possibility of collections of collections, the matter of infinite quantities inevitably arose—and these infinities behaved in ways that defied the intuition of seasoned mathematicians and lay readers alike. Both set theory and group theory amounted to a rethinking of what mathematics was and what it could do, and both relied heavily on formal definition as an inaugurat ing act. Bugaev seems not only to have embraced these new habits in his mathematical work (though he certainly did that, and his pupils seem to be largely responsible for the early favorable reception and development of set theory in Russia38), but also to have applied these new patterns of thought to non-mathematical (or not entirely mathematical) problems as well. 37) Vladimir Solovyov, "Smysl' liubvi," Vop.

Loren Graham and Jean Michel Kantor also describe this historical moment in two co-written articles: "A Comparison</page><page sequence="23">Т. Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175—198 197 Thus, however plodding, pedantic, even exasperating Bugaev's style may be, it encodes a way of thinking that is in an important way more modern than Solovyov's in "The Meaning of Love." For Bugaev, the practice of definition implies two important points: 1) serious but needless misunderstandings can result if the participants in a discussion are using their terms in different ways, and those misunderstandings merely clutter the field; also 2) the meanings and implications of terms will vary with the discussion in which they are used; thus one cannot rely on a stable, pre-established, or "essential" meaning of any given term, but must constantly define and redefine. The first principle we could relate to the idea of "rigor"; the second, to "relativism" of a limited type. Both principles are crucial for Russian thinkers of the early twentieth century, including the formalists, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Lev Vygotsky. Transformation and Invariance (and mathematical Group Theory) When Bugaev defines monads, he uses something like the powerful tech nique of transformations that arose in group theory. That branch of mathe matics identifies invariants, not in any absolute sense, but with respect to transformations. Thus, a group is a collection of elements that retain a given invariant feature when put through a given transformation. "The monad," he says, "is something which remains immutable in a whole series of changes."39 Monadicity—the quality of being a monad—is therefore a relative property (relative to a certain kinds of transformation). Of course, he does not build his monadology on a mathematically rigorous foundation of group theory. However, he does apply the same style of thought, which does not begin with substantive foundational elements (God, mind, number...) but with dynamic interrelations. In this way we can see Bugaev's monadology as part of a more general, international trend in thought, a trend that came to encompass linguistics, literary theory, and anthropology: the trend that we know as structuralism. Under this regime, individual items, words, numbers, personalities, sentences, equations, stories, and even societies tend towards an asymptote of inter changeability as their governing grammars succumb to analysis and synthesis. It is not the individual monads that count, but the rules by which they operate, ofTwo Cultural Approaches to Mathematics: France and Russia, 1890-1930," his, 97: 56-74, and "'Soft' Area Studies versus 'Hard' Social Science: A False Opposition," Slavic Review 66, no. 1 (Spring 2007), 1-19, as well as in Naming Infinity. 3,1 "Ev. Mon" sec. 5; 27/130</page><page sequence="24">198 Т. Langen / Russian History 38 (2011) 175-198 the changes under which they remain whole, and the ones under which they don't. Yet if we might like to see Bugaev as some sort of proto-structuralist, we should also observe that he was "postmodern" enough to see that each gram mar has its own peculiarity, its own charm or monadicity, which may or may not fit smoothly with the next one. In many of these respects the generation after Bugaev's carried with them the impression of his way of thinking, just as a monad carries with it the memory of past complexes it has joined. The complex that was Bugaev's intel lectual milieu—during a period sometimes known as the "era of small deeds" following the assassination of Alexander II in 1881—has disintegrated, and it did not produce many monuments. It has mostly faded into the background. But it lives on in the work of the next generation, one that did produce many monuments still standing to this day: Russian Formalist literary theory, with its insistence on its own disciplinary autonomy and on strictures that guide the work of the literary historian; Lev Vygotsky, who sought precision in the psychology of language by reconfiguring the relations among thought and speech, finding new minimal units of study, new monads, as Bugaev would doubtless say40; Pavel Florensky, whose theological writing is notable both for its metaphysical audacity and for its displays of rigor; and Bugaev's own son, Andrey Bely, who sought enlightenment with equal vigor in charting unful filled ictuses and in the creation of whole mythologies, and whose creative work proceeds in large part by dismembering familiar rubrics of perception (the physical human body, the disciplines of poetry, music, and philosophy, the word...) and using their component parts to form new units (a stream of shoulders, a dramatic symphony, a pervasive color). Standing behind these better-known writers, Bugaev is no foreground figure. But he wrote cogently and inventively around a central problem—the proper interaction between humanistic questions and rigorous problem-solving-—which we have still not resolved. 401 Lev Vygotsky, Thought and Language, trans.
