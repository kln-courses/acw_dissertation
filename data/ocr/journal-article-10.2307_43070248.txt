<plain_text><page sequence="1">Transformation (2000) 17:3, 82-85 0265-3788 Culture from an evangelical perspective Carver T. YU Carver T. YU is Vice President and Professor at the China Graduate School of Theology, Hong Kong Keywords: culture, fulfilment Culture as a gift for fulfilment Barth gives us perhaps the most succinct definition of 'culture': 'Culture means humanity'.1 In other words, man does not live in culture, his very being is actualized and concretized as culture. In so far as humanity is a gift from God, culture is also a gift from God. At the same time, 'seen from the point of view of creation, the kingdom of nature (regnum naturae ), culture is the prom- ise originally given to man he is to become'.2 With that promise intrinsic to his being, man cannot stop striving to draw out and com- plete what nature holds for him. Even as sinner, as one who alienates himself from himself, he nevertheless strives for whole- ness as if answering the call to a certain destiny. The French definition of 'civiliza- tion' as 'the sum of the aims proceeding from human activity...' and the German defini- tion of Kultur as 'the idea of the final goal and the totality of norms by which human activity should be guided' point to the direct- edness intrinsic to culture. All culture, no matter how inadequate, aims to achieve a certain degree of wholeness for human existence. The wholeness of humanity however can only be found in the fulfilment of man as the image of God. 'The image is not in man; it is man'.3 Man shares the sanctity that belongs to God As the image of God, man shares the sanctity that belongs to God. A sanctity, which confronts even God's absolute free- dom and power as its boundary, in so far as God has chosen to use his freedom to affirm it and not violate it. We can thus even say that man shares the kind of absoluteness that belongs to God. In this sense, it is quite understandable that early church fathers like Athanasius as well as Basil the Great, and subsequently the Eastern Orthodox tra- dition, have put so much emphasis on the idea of the 'deification of man'. Athanasius, referring to the logic of Christ's incarnation would say, 'He was made man that we might be made god'. Basil would also put it thus: 'man is nothing less than a creature that has received the order to become god'.4 Referring to the biblical tradition, Heschel points out that 'It is an important fact, how- ever, that in contrast with Babylonia and particularly Egypt, where the preoccupation with death was the central issue of religious thinking, the Bible hardly deals with death as a problem. Its central concern is not, as in the Gilgamesh Epic, how to escape death, but rather how to sanctify life. And the divine image and likeness does not serve man to attain immortality but to attain sanctity.'5 Ensuring the sanctity of the human person as that which is holy to God is the most fun- damental directive of culture as the manifestation of humanity. A culture, if it is to fulfill its task for the actualization of humanity, cultivates a sense of sacredness for his neighbour. 'Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself (Leviticus 19:18) is an inevitable implication drawn from the fact that behind and above each human person, there is the absolute God. At the same time, man hears inside himself the call from God, 'you shall be holy for I, the Lord, your God, am holy' (Leviticus 19:2). Culture should also give expression to the sense of the sacred (or holy) intrinsic to man. A culture which cultivates commitment to the unconditional, is being true to its task. In so far as God's freedom expresses his absoluteness, man has a kind of freedom reflecting God's freedom of self-determina- tion, self-initiation and self-limitation. At the same time, as God created man as Adam, a distinct individual, and had not created a mass of humanity as the bearer of His image, the individual with distinctive identity (with a specific name) and freedom is of supreme significance in the Christian definition of humanity. Yet the individual does not exist in abstraction from the ground of his being, nor from his intrinsic relation with other men. He has his identity only in the very act of communion with God as well as with oth- ers. 'God created man in his image. Male and female he created them.' The moment Adam knows his individuality, he knows it as something that bears within it the pres- ence of others. Thus man's being is being in relation. Sociality and solidarity is basic to his humanity. Other than the fact that God's presence (the reality of his being God's image) is intrinsic to man, ma≈à is present to man. Covenantal commitment and indi- vidual distinctiveness are inseparable correlates. Freedom is also exercised within this being in relation. There is no genuine individuality and freedom without commit- ment, and there is no true covenantal commitment without real individuality. Cul- ture in its authentic manifestation oi humanity brings freedom and commitment together as two inseparable mutual determi- nants. An authentic culture cultivates freedom as freedom-for. It cultivates a free- dom that enables the self to transcend itself. The magnitude of self-transcendence is another measure for the authenticity of culture. The individual does not exist in abstraction On the basis of humanity thus consti- tuted, man receives two mandates from God as part of the fulfilment, to administrate the created order (Genesis 1 :26-27), and to give names to the living creatures. Man is to till and guard what has been entrusted to him, so that the land prospers. Ensuring prosper- ity and enjoying abundance from it as the sign of God's goodness is also a significant mandate of culture. To till and to keep, man is to bring out the values intrinsic to nature, to articulate it in such a way that it gives glory to God and abundance to man. 82 July 2000 : TRANSFORMATION</page><page sequence="2">Material abundance is also a sign of authen- tic culture. At the same time, man is to give names to the living creatures. To give name is to define and thus give meaning and allo- cate values. Meaning-and- value creation is another task of culture. This gives space for human creativity and imagination. God's world can be explored and related to in many possible ways. In tilling and keeping, in nam- ing and defining, man draws the land, the living beings and himself into a unified struc- ture of meaningfulness with God as the ground. He builds his world of meaning and values based on reality. This is the realm of knowledge, and wisdom mediates his rela- tion with the created order. An authentic culture cultivates an openness to the life-world in which man is being actively engaged by God's created order. He does not stand outside the created order as subject over against objects, subjecting the world into a world-picture (world-view) of his sheer imagination. Rather he sees his reality as part and parcel of a totality. Sin and the distortion of God's promise The reality of sin puts authentic culture on the defensive. What has been a promise now hangs over man as a judgment of man's unfaithfulness. In so far as the freedom of man is a real gift from God, then his will to distort the promise of God is allowed with its full effect, even if it is contained in God's providence. And so, the distortion of humanity sets in and permeates every aspect of culture. The land still prospers, but pros- perity can become destructive. There will be thorns and thistles, which will block and disrupt man's attempt for order and abun- dance. What should have been positive directives for fulfilment can now become vortices drawing man into stifling cul-de-sacs. Culture thus contains implica- tions of the curse from God as well as the working of man's sinful design.In the face of the reality of sin, all cultures, including those deeply touched by the Christian gospel and even those which claim to be Christian cul- tures, are mixtures of what is reminiscent of God's promise, God's preserving grace and human distortion. All encounter God's judgment and God's affirming grace. And so, when Christians are confronted with cul- tures other than their own, they ought to be humble, knowing that no culture, including the culture in which Christianity prospers, can claim to be true to God's promise. Even Christians cannot but live in cultures which are still under the judgment but also the pre- serving and redeeming grace of God. All cultures are to be judged by the Word of God, they too are to be affirmed by the Word of God as God's gift, even in their corrupted form. The distortions and frustration of God's promise work themselves out in a variety of cultural forms. Culture thus becomes the arena where man acts out his disobedience and rejection of God. In various degrees institutions in culture may violate the integ- rity of man's being human. There may be cultural forms which blatantly deny the sanctity of man, treating him as an object or commodity, or means to certain ends. There may be cultures where human freedom is structurally stifled, man's individuality dis- solved. There may be cultural forms in which alienation is the condition of existence, where man's communal and communicative character is seriously hampered. There may be cultures in which man's solidarity with nature is damaged, and desacralization of nature is a fact of life. There may also be cultures which polarize man's spiritual and physical dimensions. Man is either reduced to the physical or his spiritual quest for liber- ation from the world displaced all concerns for the well being of worldly life. All encounter God's judgment and God's affirming grace Where do we begin to identify these dis- tortions? As man is bestowed with the gift and the mandate to create meaning and val- ues on the basis of reality, it is the structure of meaning and values that provides the magnetic centre and directive for all cultural syntheses. It is in these structures of meaning - their inner contradictions, the discrepan- cies between the ideal and the real - that we sense the deviations from the promise of God. To put it in another way, when the creative structure of meaning and value is turned into ideology, there we see clues to the problem. It is the ideology of each and every culture that has to be identified, to show the inner contradiction and discrepan- cies, to see how God's promise, his preserving grace has been distorted in the light of the krisis of God's Word. Despite man's wilful distortion, God's grace continues, his promise still stands. Here we share Barth's conviction when he says, This gift, his humanity, is not blotted out through the fall of man, nor is its good- ness diminished'.6 This conviction is based on the humanity of God revealed in Jesus Christ, that 'in his sovereign decision, God is human. His free affirmation of man, his free substitution for him - this is God's humanity.' 'From the point of view of recon- ciliation, the kingdom of grace, culture is the law in reference to which the sinner, sancti- fied by God has to practice his faith and obedience.'7 Culture seen from this perspec- tive has now become God's instrument as a preservation order preventing man from falling into total chaos. From then on, cul- ture is a mixture; on the one hand it contains God's original promise, man's rebellion as well as God's providential reference for preservation. The church fathers see laws and government (even the persecuting Roman government) as necessary evils under the providence of God to prevent men from eating up each other. In this sense, cul- ture has to be affirmed. As an instrument for preservation, cul- ture contains a curse, which is also a blessing in disguise. Man is subjected to toils and labour, to the adversity of the created order, which questions his dominion, to disciplines of life which call his freedom into question. Even in this way, culture reflects the preserv- ing and redeeming grace of God. As Augustine puts it in his City of God , There is a common use among both kinds of men and households of things neces- sary to this mortal life ... For the earthly city, which does not live by faith, seeks an earthly peace; and interests itself in the harmony of rule and obedience among its citizens to the end that there may be a cer- tain agreement of men's wills regarding the things that pertain to this life. But the heavenly city, or rather that part of it which only makes pilgrimage in mortal- ity and lives by faith, is likewise obliged to make use of this peace . . . Hence while it continues to live in the earthly city as a captive in its pilgrimage ... it does not hesitate to conform to the laws of the earthly city whereby are administered the things suited to the maintenance of mortal life; and since this mortality is common to all, a harmony is preserved between the two cities in respect of things which pertain to it. 8 As preservation order, culture has in many ways become reactive attempts to sus- tain rather than to create. At the same time, the distortions and aberrations of what orig- inally belong to God's promise work their way into all aspects of man's life, even affect- ing what had been intended as part of the preservation order. Culture has now become at once both a pointer to the fulfilment of God's promise, a preservation order, and a stifling structure of man's sinfulness. Critique of culture The contingent 'absoluteness' of man bestowed by God to ensure his sanctity has in one way or another been distorted in cultural forms as man's self-absolutization. Deification of man as a possibility in Christ is taken over by the human spirit. Man becomes god to himself. Such self- absolutization of man comes to its height in the form of the structure of meaning in which the transcendent is radically denied. 83 TRANSFORMATION : Culture from an evangelical perspective</page><page sequence="3">In such cultures, the saeculum, the present or the facticity of human existence is taken as the totality of meaning. Anthropocentrism prevails, and 'the whole creation has been groaning', 'for the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it' (Romans 8:18-23). Such deification of man has appeared in history time and again. How- ever, radically secularized modern culture coming out from the 'Christian' West and the postmodern narcissistic culture as an outcome of the radicalization of the Roman- tic reaction against the Enlightenment is a form of self-absolutization that is most dam- aging to humanity and to nature. Within such a culture, man shuts himself off from the sense of transcendent mystery and the sense of the sacredness of being. This ultimately undermines himself as the mean- ing-foundation. Reason and freedom thus conceived, the two pillars of the cultural pro- ject of the Enlightenment, finally become highly problematic and threaten to break down completely under the full impact of scepticism and subjectivism. Man becomes god to himself Freedom bestowed by God can also be misconstrued in a totally individualistic way. Freedom is taken as freedom without commitment. The social evils coming out from the market economy reveal the true nature of such freedom. Here again, func- tional rationality has undermined the personal realm of being so much that the val- ues vital to the development of capitalism are withering. In the social dimension, social fragmentation has become so severe that modern society is in danger of the total collapse of the public realm. The integratedness of man as a unity of diverse dimensions is also violated. Under the pressure of positivistic reductionism, man is reduced to his physical realm of being. Man thus becomes one-dimensional. His spiritual dimension is disregarded. What is supposed to be a creative construction of meaningfulness and values based √≥n reality becomes an ideology - ideology as false con- sciousness. Again, this creates a pervasive sense of spiritual predicament in modern culture. The validity of science itself is in question as scientific truth itself can be reduced to an epi-phenomenon of bio- chemical reactions. Scientistic reductionism in the final analysis negates itself. We can see from the above analysis that within a culture that absolutizes itself, or violates the integrity of humanity, an inner dialectics of self-negation always sets in, until finally it collapses under its weight. We can see that as a principle designed by divine providence, to reveal to man his inauthentic existence. However, even in such a situation, culture as a gift from God and as the preser- vation order provided by God to sustain sinful man so as to keep him open for redemption is set to work. The deep yearning expressed in various spiritual forms point man to his spiritual predicaments, and thus to the unfulfilled promise of what he should be. The rule of law, the various advances for the enrichment of humanity, the various movements in response to personal and social fragmentation, the prophetic calls for justice and liberation, stand as signs of God's affirmation of culture as the fulfil- ment of his promise for humanity. Indeed, before we look at Asian cultures, it is the West, developing out of its abandon- ment of the Christian tradition, placing human rationality and freedom at the centre of the universe, that ought to be radically criticized. If we fail to criticize western cul- ture, we have discredited ourselves for the prophetic claim of the gospel. While we encounter man in the West as secular anthropocentric individual, we encounter man in Asian traditions more as homo-religiosus. The sense of the sacred and the sense of sanctity of life are relatively stronger. Society is structured more as a communion than as an association. Covenantal commitment takes precedent over individuality. The awareness of cosmic solidarity stands out rather clearly. The draw-back of Asian tradition when placed alongside the technological power of the West seems to be the inner inertia hindering scientific development. And from the mis- sionary-evangelistic perspective, their religions confront the gospel as closed systems. In Asian cultural traditions, we see the promise as well as the judgment of God. In so far as the sanctity of humanity is affirmed without losing sight of his depend- ence on the transcendent, Asian humanistic insights to this effect have to be taken as a sign of God's original gift. At the same time, insights about the contingency of human existence can also be taken as a sign of gift from God. In Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism, the Nothingness of human existence is stressed. This understanding of the nature of human existence in itself agrees in a profound way with the Christian belief in creatio ex nihilo. It depicts the condition of man in alienation from God. Man is keenly aware of the fact that existence grounding on man himself is nothingness. So attachment to the self is a delusion leading only to suffering. In Jesus Christ, man is created to be real From the evangelical perspective, how- ever, the nothingness of the differentiated human person does not have the final word. In Jesus Christ, man is created to be real. The sanctity and integrity of the human person has, of course, its ground in divine reality, but divine reality does not absorb the human person, thus rendering it an insignifi- cant epiphenomenon of the divine drama of unfolding. No, God takes human existence so seriously that he became man, so that man may become as holy as God, i.e., as that which is 'separated', but 'separated for' divine-human communion. In the Christian tradition, genuine communion goes hand in hand with the act of covenanting. The very act of covenanting ensures the integrity of both parties. The Hindu tradition as a life-system in many ways reflects the promise for authentic humanity. The utter devotion to the Absolute, the calm self-surrender, the non-attachment to the fruit of one's self- sacrifice, and the single-minded discipline for the quest of deliverance, reveal a deep awareness of man as he is and what he should be. It would seem rather arrogant for Christians to brush it aside as valueless paganism. With such deep spirituality, however, one is puzzled as to why Hindu culture is rid- dled with extreme poverty, with the criminal vast gap between the rich and the poor, with a caste system which has for centuries been so inhuman and yet well justified by the same spiritual tradition which calls for our deepest admiration. Where has been the pro- phetic judgment of social injustice and inhumanity? Why is there no inner dynamic for social change? What is the intrinsic prob- lem to the historical and social process? The problem of Hinduism, however, lies not in what appears to be polytheism, for in fact it may be regarded as intensely mono- theistic. 'To admit the various descriptions of God is not to lapse into polytheism. When Yajnavalkya was called upon to state the number of gods, he started with the popular number of 3,306, and ended by reducing them all to one Brahman. "This indestructi- ble enduring reality is to be looked upon as one only." These different representations do not tell us about what God is in himself but what he is to us. The anthropomorphic conceptions of the divine is relative to our needs.'9 The problem lies in the fact that it is 84 July 2000 : TRANSFORMATION</page><page sequence="4">a system of self-absolutization in another direction. It stresses the identity between God and man so much that on the one hand the world and the self is so relativized that it may even be interpreted as maya, as the great Samkara would take it, or as moments in the Ufe process of Brahman, as Radhakrihnan would take it. On the other hand, this amounts to the affirmation that whatever is, is Real and Divine. Let us quote from the Upanishad: There is nothing that is not Spirit. The personal Self is the impersonal Spirit. It has four conditions. First comes the material condition - common to all - per- ception turned outward . . . This is known as the waking condition. The second is the mental condition, perception turned inward ... wherein the Self enjoys subtle matter. This is known as the dreaming condition. In the deep sleep man feels no desire, creates no dream. The undream- ing sleep is the third condition, the intel- lectual condition. Because of his union with the Self and his unbroken knowl- edge of it, he is filled with joy; his mind is illuminated ... He is neither that which is known nor that which is unknown . . . The only proof of His existence is union with Him. The world disappears in Him . . . ."10 If the phenomenal world, the world pro- cess, and the self are moments in the drama of divine unfolding, then each moment is absolute and necessary. All events in the his- torical process, or all structures in the social process, may then be justified as part and parcel of the Absolute. It is the drama of the poor to remain poor, as the lot is fallen to them in a designated scene of the drama. The oppressive caste system would appear totally justified. It is not the individual person who is absolutized, but the historico-social process. With this absolutization, the society closes in on itself. Transcendent critique proves unnecessary and impossible. In contrast, a society touched by the gospel would acknowledge distance between God and man, the histori- cal and social processes around man are not completely determined by the divine but to a large extent reflect man's own making. As soon as man also acknowledges himself as a sinner, there is openness for a transcendent critique of society. It is the drama of the poor to remain poor While acknowledging the spiritual depth of Hinduism, we must point out the fact that the promise of God for the distinct charac- teristic of being human, and freedom bestowed on man to find and create meaning and value on the basis of God's creation, does not mean that man has to be absorbed into the divine and loses himself in order to find fulfilment. Individuality and freedom of man has its own right, protected by God and accompanied by God. Prophetic justice has to be proclaimed as a demand from God as his gift in ensuring the sanctity of each and every created being; it is also his mandate for man to bear covenantal responsibility. Christ is the fulfilment of the promise that all are one in him. It is also a gift of God that man is an in- tegrated being, he receives both physical and spiritual blessings from God. Hinduism seems to have placed relatively less atten- tion on physical reality while putting great emphasis on spiritual quest. Poverty can be a result of the neglect or even tacit negation of the physical world. The material world is real and it is a gift from God for the fulfilment of mutual engagement and involvement between God, man and cosmos. If we are to confront Hindu culture with the judgment of the Word of God, the judg- ment is not to condemn but to affirm, to affirm the gift of God already manifested, and to affirm what fulfilment there could be in the promise of God for all cultures. Christ the ultimate fulfilment The promise of what humanity can become has already been given. It is up to man to bring the promise to fulfilment in working out his structure of meaning and values. Christ as the mediator of creation and redemption has, in his concrete incarna- tion, revealed the fulfilment of what man can become. The reality of human wholeness and the fullest disclosure of divine-human love are unfolded in him. Not only unfolded in him but made available through him. Through his sacrifice the estrangement from God is overcome. God is infinitely close to man in Jesus Christ. Man is once again con- fronted with the free grace of God and his promise for humanity. The fulfilment of the promise becomes genuinely possible. Christ then may be regarded as the crown of what every culture is striving for and yet frus- trated by its inner contradiction.11 A culture confronted by Christ does not need to be a clean empty. page rid completely of its intel- lectual, moral, aesthetic or religious a priori, so long as all these a priori become open to self criticism as to whether they have been the source of inner contradictions and stumblingblocks for the fulfilment of God's promise.il Notes 1.
