<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Terrestrial and Aquatic Intelligence of Linda Hogan DonelleN.Dreese Linda Hogan, an American Indian author of Chickasaw descent, has pub lished novels, poetry and prose that explore issues surrounding Native history and spirituahty, cultural displacements, and environmental protec tion. Her work Dwellings: A Spiritual History ofThe Living World{\995) could be perhaps categorized as a work of creative nonfiction given that it interweaves history, philosophy, autobiography, and storytelling within the framework of the rubric we call "a sense of place." In the preface to Dwellings, Hogan reveals that the writings have grown out of her "won dering what makes us human, out of a lifelong love for the living world and all its inhabitants" (11). She also states that the work reflects "the differ ent histories of ways of tWnking and being in the world," and that she writes "out of respect for the natural world, recognizing that humankind is not separate from nature" (12). Her devotion to place reflects these inspi rations and requests our acknowledgment of the planet we call home and its non-human communities. The writings of Dwellings have also grown out of Hogan's "native understanding that there is a terrestrial intelli gence that lies beyond our human and knowing and grasping" (11). This "terrestrial intelligence," although acknowledged by Hogan as inacces sible to human comprehension, plays a significant role in inspiring Dwell ings as a spiritual history where oral traditions and nature's mysteries are given prominence over Western ideological constructs of nature that have been confirmed detrimental in the midst of the contemporary environmen tal crisis. Informed by her Native heritage that encourages reverence for,</page><page sequence="2">Donelle N. Breese 7 and reciprocity to, the natural world, Hogan's respect for the earth's ter restrial intelligence is clear in her insistence on a more balanced relation ship between the spirit world and human world. This balance is essential in maintaining a sustainable planet, and the answer to much human suffer ing. Hogan's terrestrial intelligence is not confined to territories of solid ground. In The Book of Medicines (1993), water becomes a recurring im age for physical and psychological healing in a contemporary world of sexism, drought, violence, and hunger. In this poetic work, Hogan evokes terrains reminiscent of tribal origins, such as the Chickasaw emergence story of rising from an underground origin into the world through a lake. Additionally, Hogan attempts to integrate the past with the present in this work, and to reconcile her mythic/historical sense of place with her con temporary sense of place. These two conflicting territories give rise to an aquatic, poetic terrain, which is at once beautifully nostalgic, and at the same time sorrowful and brutal. Like Dwellings, The Book of Medicines challenges Western constructs, but with an ecoferninist activism that brings together women and water imagery to expose male exploitation of women and nature on an aquatic terrain. Hogan's belief in a terrestrial intelli gence, or faith in the spirit and mystery of nature as a source of wisdom, is evoked in this work as an aquatic intelligence. In both works, social activism is drawn from sources of spirit and mystery where injustices committed against women and the non-human natural world are addressed. Hogan demonstrates that by studying this form of intelligence, we can learn how to take better care of our environment, and one another. A Terrestrial Intelligence When encountering Linda Hogan's works,we should note Hogan's differ ent perspectives on being in the world and her philosophies in relation to nature. In Dwellings, her focus on the spiritual dimension or terrestrial intelligence of dwelling places and living creatures reinforces the notion of the earth as a vital, living organism upon which we live and also con nects the earth to a larger cosmic realm. The small, seemingly trivial dwell ings of creatures are as spiritually significant for their existence and func tion in the natural process as the whole of the earth itself. Her questioning of Western meanings imposed on aspects of the natural world forces us to recognize the anthropocentric constructions of nature as an ideology with many fixed meanings. But Dwellings is more than a quest challeng ing meanings and places, it is also a guidebook on how to nurture a more spiritual connection with the world and its inhabitants.</page><page sequence="3">8 SAIL 11.4 Winter 1999. Linda Hogan's approach to nature is nothing less than mythical, mystical, and magical. Much of her philosophy and view of nature is founded in American Indian mythology. She claims that "in recent times, the term 'myth' has come to signify falsehood, but when we examine myths, we find that they are a high form of truth. They are the deepest, innermost cultural stories of our human journeys toward spiritual and psychological growth" (51). The symbolic meanings of animals and places within the natural world that she uses to dismantle existing Western no tions come from these myths that shape her worldview. In the chapter called "The Bats," Hogan describes these winged creatures, who are often associated with the blood-sucking terrors of Dracula, as sacred creatures that occupy two worlds, giving them great insight and wisdom. These bats for Hogan "live inside the passageways between earth and sunlight." They are "two animals merged into one, a milk-producing rodent that bear live young, and a flying bird. They are creatures of dusk which is the time between times, people of the thresh old" (27). For Hogan, bats are given spiritual significance in that they exist in a lirninal state between worlds and therefore act as guardians of the passage into a higher spiritual state. Hogan claims that in Native stories "the bat people are said to live in the first circle of holiness. Thus, they are intermediaries between our world and the next" (27). As interme diaries, bats transcend the Western and popular culture stigmas that have associated them with fear and evil. Also, Hogan's conception of the next world of spirits is not one of evil and death but a world populated by holy beings and ancestors. The bats, therefore, are guides to a more spiritual existence as opposed to being creatures from a horrifying darkness. Hogan's chapter on snakes is similar. She deconstructs the associa tion of snakes with Satan as the force that tempts Eve out of her virtue and redefines the serpent as a symbol of wholeness and regenerative life. Due 'to the snake's ability to coil itself in the form of spiraling circles, it echoes the circular life philosophy of continuity, reciprocation, and holistic living (nurturing spiritual, mental, physical, and emotional needs) rather than the Western linear construct, which leaves a loose end dangling into oblivion. In the chapter entitled "Creations," Hogan writes, "unlike the cyclic nature of time for the Maya, the Western tradition of beliefs within a straight line of history leads to an apocalyptic end. And stories of the end, like those of the beginning, tell something about the people who created them" (85). Hogan is suggesting here that people of Western cultural backgrounds live in destructive ways that will ultimately lead to</page><page sequence="4">Donelle K Breese 9 their own doom. By living life in a linear fashion, one takes without giving back and progresses toward a goal without examining future consequences. Linearity suggests that there is a beginning, middle, and an end, and one lives in accordance with the line towards bringing about that end. A linear existence may refer to engaging in various forms of self-destructive be havior as well as behaviors that are destructive to others or the non human world we inhabit. Hogan believes that if people take responsibility for one another as well as the earth, and perceive life as circular, with transformations instead of conclusions, their attitude toward life priori tizes preservation and sustaining what they may someday need. Hogan contends that "Before SNAKE became the dark god of our underworld, burdened with human sin, it carried a different weight in our human bones; it was a being of holy inner earth" (140). As a being asso ciated with the inner earth, the snake is at the core of life and creation for Hogan and many other Native cultures. In Gloria Anzald?a's Border lands/La Frontera, the serpent's mouth is symbolic of womanhood where it is considered "the most sacred place on earth, a place of refuge, the creative womb from which all things were born and to which all things returned" (34). It is intriguing that the snake as a symbol of life and birth in some Native oral traditions finds its contrast in the Western tradition where it is the symbol of sin and death. Hogan maintains that "in more recent times, the snake has symbolized our wrongs, our eating from the tree of knowledge, our search and desire for the dangerous revelations of life's mystery" (141). The biblical story of Adam and Eve has indeed given snakes a bad reputation. The edenic snake is the ultimate symbol of temp tation and represents the fall of humankind. Hogan's work provides a much-needed alternative signification for this creature. In her attempt to reshape our notions of bats and snakes, Hogan strives to break down the human/nature dichotomy and heal the alien ation between humans and the natural world that has led to environmental degradation. She maintains that at the core of this alienation are Western religion and philosophies. In "Creations," Hogan asserts that "the West ern belief that God lives apart from earth has taken us toward collective destruction" (85). In many Native philosophies, gods and goddesses, who represent Hogan's idea of a terrestrial intelligence, walk amongst the people sometimes in spirit form, other times in the shapes of animals and other people. The fact that the Christian God is located in a separate "heavenly" realm and "above" the earth and its inhabitants suggests that the earth is a place of sin and physical matter that needs to be tran scended. The body dies and remains on earth to disintegrate, while the</page><page sequence="5">10 SAIL IIA Winter 1999. soul transcends to a spiritual, unearthly place. While followers of Emersonian thought and earth-based religions have worked to show the presence of spirituality in non-human living things, the separation of God from earth suggests that inhabitation on earth is ultimately undesirable. hi Dwellings, Hogan explores in detail the homes and dwelling places of animals, birds and Native peoples. By exploring the history of the natural world in regards to its Native American mythological and spiritual significance, she highlights how close the lives of animals are to human life, in order to combat the human/nature alienation created by Western thought. In one instance, she tells a story about how one day, hiking up a mountain side to hear the voices of great horned owls, she discovered a nest that had fallen from a tree along her path. Much to her delight, she found that the birds that built the nest used a thread from a skirt she owns to build their home. She states, "I liked it, that a thread of my life was in an abandoned nest, one that held eggs and new life" (124). On looking at it more closely, she discovered strands of her daughter's hair were also used to build the nest. In thinking about the nest, Hogan claims, "I didn't know what kind of nest it was, or who had lived there. It didn't matter. I thought of the remnants of our lives carried up the hill that way and turned into shelter" (124). What is most important for Hogan in this occurrence is the fact that the birds benefited from her existence in some way, and that she played a small role in the issuance of new life. In this case Hogan uses the example of the bird's nest to point out that many creatures make use of the materials they find in the wild to structure and build their dwellings, but profligate use of materials seems to be a characteristic more analogous to human consumption. In addition to a bird's nest, Hogan depicts caves as important dwell ing places for Native communities. Firstly, caves provided the entrance ways between worlds; these are the homes of bats, who act as intermedi aries, as discussed earlier. Secondly, caves were refuges from dispute and strife that took place in the world outside the caves: "In earlier days, before the springs and caves were privately owned, they were places of healing for Indian people, places where conflict between tribes and people was left behind, neutral ground, a sanctuary outside the reign of human difference, law, and trouble" (29). The caves, therefore, provided a tempo rary retreat for the tribes: from war and conflict. They are places to go to think and regroup, to rest and plan the next course of action. In Hogan's novel Mean Spirit (1990), the character Michael Horse retreats to a cave to record the history of his Native people in a journal in an effort to supplement the Bible with Indian ways. The character Belle Graycloud</page><page sequence="6">Donelle N. Breese 11 also believes that this "Sorrow Cave" is the home for bats that are bearers of powerful medicine accessible only to those who believe. For Hogan, caves are places of great spiritual significance: safety and sanctuary, not dark holes where fire-breathing dragons are waiting for curious travelers, as in the Western literary tradition. She also assigns a distinctly female symbolic meaning to caves. Once, on a journey near the Continental Divide with her family as a young girl, she saw an African lion at the mouth of a cave. She told her father, but he did not believe her because he did not see the lion. He even went up into the cave but returned having seen nothing. Although Hogan knew with certainty that the lion was there, her father was unable to locate it even though he returned smelling of the lion. It became clear to Hogan at a young age that there are places on earth where men do not belong. These are places where they either do not have access, or they do not have knowledge of where they are and what surrounds them. While Hogan admits that a terrestrial intelligence lies beyond human comprehension, this story suggests that perhaps there are places where women may catch a glimpse of the intelligence while men remain unaware of its presence. Hogan states that "caves are not the places for men. They are a feminine world, a womb of earth, and a germinal place of brooding. In many cre ation stories, caves are the places that bring forth life" (31). Many cre ation and emergence stories tell of a tribe coming into being from the underworld through some passage such as a cave. The underground tunnels and caves, therefore, could be equated with the womb and birth canal, where the people emerge from the world of darkness into the world oflight. One of Hogan's fundamental calls in Dwellings is for readers to teach and demonstrate stewardship for the earth. It is a practice necessary for preserving the earth's creatures, and healing the gap between the human and non-human world. She writes that "caretaking is the utmost spiritual and physical responsibility of our time, and perhaps that stewardship is finally our place in the web of life, our work, the solution to the mystery of what we are" (115). Until we learn "our place at the bountiful table, how to be a guest here, this land will not support us, will not be hospitable, will turn on us" (46). This declaration debunks the anthropocentric notion that the earth is here to serve human needs, and places the human world on equal footing with the other "guests" at the table, the non-human guests. Also emphasized in this passage is the spiritual connection with the earth and its terrestrial intelligence. Hogan passionately and convinc ingly suggests an explanation for the mystery and meaning behind human</page><page sequence="7">12 SAIL 11.4 Winter 1999. existence: recognition of one's place within the ecosystem and responsi bility for its well being. She practices what she preaches. Near the end of Dwellings, we discover that she works in a rehabilitation facility for birds of prey. Clearly, she believes that stewardship is our responsibility as co inhabitants of this place we call home. In her most direct attempt to contest the manner in which human beings view nature, she writes: We are of the animal world. We are a part of the cycles of growth and decay. Even having tried so hard to see ourselves apart, and so often without a love for even our own biology, we are in relationship with the rest of the planet, and that connectedness tells us we must recon sider the way we see ourselves and the rest of nature. (114) Reading Hogan's Dwellings can make one reconsider this relationship. Her book, with all its stories, recreates the life of the natural world that has been objectified, and it redefines non-human creatures that have been negatively stereotyped. She provides an older way to reconceive snakes, bats, birds, caves, nature, and the human world in relation to the non human world. The Aquatic Intelligence In The Book of Medicines, Hogan evokes the oral tradition pervasively throughout her poetic terrain. It may be inappropriate to refer to Hogan's sense of place as a "terrain" because that term connotes land or physical ground, and Hogan's dominant sense of place in this work is aquatic?on the sea, by the sea. She's in the water or the water is in her. Her poems are filled with oceanic images; whales, fish, fisherman, sand, salt, dolphins, ships and shells are all images that populate Hogan's poetry. In one passage from the poem "Crossings," she links water to human origin and traces the terrestrial intelligence explored in Dwellings to an aquatic be ginning: Sometimes the longing in me comes from when I remember the terrain of crossed beginnings when whales lived on land and we stepped out of water to enter our lives in air. (28)</page><page sequence="8">Donelle KDreese 13 Hogan's desire for water is primal, mythical, and echoed throughout many of the poems in The Book of Medicines. It is nostalgic of a time when humans had not assumed dominion over the earth, but were oceanic crea tures crossing paths with whales in the course of evolution and emer gence. According to Stacy Alaimo, "Crossings" expresses a "yearning to experience bodily ties with nature and to cross over to a time when those corporeal connections were most evident" (59). In addition to highlight ing physical connections, the poem suggests an interchange of knowl edge. Life that was once aquatic and is now terrestrial (and vice versa) maintains some sense or memory of its prior state of existence and evokes in Hogan the longing for the water that characterizes her sense of origin. Additionally, this "terrain of crossed beginnings" demonstrates the trans formative quality of American Indian cultures, adapting to their surround ings in order to survive rather than forcing the environment to adjust to their requirements, a characteristic of Western cultural ideologies. Informed by the aquatic intelligence that permeates the work, Hogan's poetry is directly activist. The Book of Medicines is not only a reclaiming of cultural identity and authority over her Chickasaw history, but also an ecofeminist endeavor: a voice speaking out against environmental injus tice. In an interview with Laura Coltelli, Hogan states, "Spirituality neces sitates certain kinds of political action. If you believe that the earth, and all living things, and all the stones are sacred, your responsibility really is to protect those things. I do believe that's our duty, to be custodians of the planet" (79). One of the ways in which Linda Hogan acts as custodian is by writing poetry that draws attention to injustices committed against her culture, her gender, and the environment. In the poem entitled "Hunger," Hogan personifies physical starvation as a being who "crosses oceans" and "sits on the ship and cries." The poem evokes the image of colonial settlers crossing the sea in search of that which will fulfill them. These travelers are clearly male: Hunger was the fisherman who said dolphins are like women, we took them from the sea and had our way with them. Also: It is the old man</page><page sequence="9">14 SAIL 11.4 Winter 1999. who comes in the night to cast a line and wait at the luminous shore. He knows the sea is pregnant with clear fish and their shallow pools of eggs. The language and imagery in these passages are highly sexual, equating an exploitation of natural resources with the exploitation of women. The first passage conjures up images of rape, with dolphins "like women," taken from their aquatic territories and objectified to serve the needs of the fishermen. The second passage introduces the sea itself as the figure of a bountiful, pregnant woman who is fertile and unaware as the men ap proach at night waiting to draw from her that which she nurtures. Criticism of this nature/woman subordination is at the core of ecofeminist theory. Anne Booth and Harvey Jacobs explain that "ecofeminism equates the suppression and domination of nature with the domination of women, and for similar reasons. Each was, and is perceived as dangerous and in need of control" (29). If we understand the domina tion of nature as that which exploits, devalues, destroys and/or renders powerless natural resources, ecofeminism contends that the same kind of philosophy behind this domination is inherent in the attitudes which have attempted to justify the exploitation women. "The standard history of colonialism," according to Greta Gaard, is "one in which the oppressive structures of capitalism, Christianity, and patriarchy construct nature, and in which those associated with nature are considered resources for the colonizer, means to his ends, interesting only in terms of their subordina tion" (12). The alienating and destructive dichotomies nurtured by West ern metaphysical ideologies are what ecofeminists are trying to dismantle. Culture/nature, mind/body, black/white, man/woman, intellect/emotion are all examples of structures which lie at the root of subordination and are perpetuated by those who benefit from them. Because the ecofeminist agenda involves healing these artificial separations and challenging exist ing power structures, writers and theorists such as Susan Griffin and Ynestra King, among many others, have made writing an activist endeavor to help us better understand ourselves, and make connections where there are gaps. Early colonists, before arriving on the new continent, were expecting a Garden of Eden and land of plenty for their consumption. The journals of Columbus describe a lush land with cinnamon and spice, aromatic plants,</page><page sequence="10">Donelle N. Breese 15 herbs, flowers, fertile soil and an abundance of gold. The Spaniards were looking for what they already knew as familiar and that would result in personal or capital gain. This is where the metaphor of nature as virgin woman has its roots. Annette Kolodny in Lay of the Land: Metaphor as Experience and History in American Life and Letters examines the land/ nature-as-woman symbolization in American literature. She refers to the metaphor as a male fantasy: a daily reality of harmony between man and nature based on an expe rience of the land as essentially feminine?that is, not simply the land as mother, but the land as woman, the total female principle of gratifi cation?enclosing the individual in an environment of receptivity, repose, and painless integral satisfaction. (4) While the poem "Hunger" takes place on or near the ocean, Kolodny's theories could still be applied here. The poem, situated in an historical context, enables the speaker to tell of the beginnings of the colonial settle ments that ultimately brought about American Indian cultural genocide, and carried with it patriarchal practices enforced by a belief in a divinely ordained mission to dominate and subjugate the "new world." Given that the psychology behind dominating other life forms can also be traced back to fear, an aquatic or terrestrial intelligence emanating from the un known or mystery in the non-human natural world would be deemed a threat and in need of controlling. Another example of this patriarchal assault on women and the land is in the poem "Harvesters of Night and Water." It begins with the image of men out on a boat in the middle of the ocean fighting to capture a resistant octopus. The boat they are on is described as "white" and "small" and the nets they are using are described as "impotent" and "limp." Again, Hogan uses sexual imagery, while no doubt making simultaneous descriptive references to those who occupy the boat. The speaker is sorrowful for the violent and cruel manner in which the men attempt to catch the octopus: The tentacles fall down over themselves and inch down, with the men screaming, jabbing at it. I want to stop them. I want to tell them what I know, that this life collects coins like they do</page><page sequence="11">16 SAIL 11.4 Winter 1999. and builds walls on the floor of the sea. (23) This passage reveals the frustration Hogan experiences in wanting others to respect and value living creatures other than humans. She wants to heal the gap that dominant culture has placed between humans and na ture by telling the men that the sea creature lives its life to survive as they do. The octopus saves valuables for future use and builds its home underwater in the same way that the men do on land. I don't argue that Hogan is trying to humanize the octopus in an anthropomorphic sense, but rather to foster respect: this creature is a living being and not simply an object for capture and consumption. Furthermore, the objectification of nature that allows these men to brutally attack the octopus is a result of the notion that human beings are not a part of nature. Otherwise, there would be an understanding that the men are brutalizing a part of them selves. Hogan ends the poem with this stanza: I want the world to be kinder. I am a woman. I am afraid. I saw a star once, falling toward me. It was red with brilliant arms and then it was gone. (24) Hogan's call for a kinder world is echoed by the vanishing falling red star, which may symbolize the strength and brilliance of Native cultures. As a woman, she is aware that there is much to be afraid of. The harvesters of the night can kill and exploit women in the same manner that they brutally attack the octopus. This disrespect for other forms of life has created a ?cruel and brutal world in Hogan's view. The men who are harvesting the night in the seas that she navigates in her poetry fail to acknowledge and respect the aquatic intelligence that surrounds them. The themes explored in Hogan's writings directly link women and Native American cultures to the environment and landscape as members of a community that share a history of oppression. The identifiable his tory of exploitation and misuse experienced by women and Native Ameri cans in relation to the land has allowed various environmental move ments to complement one another for a common cause?to raise aware ness and improve the way human beings behave towards the places they inhabit, and one another. Hogan's natural world in The Book of Medi</page><page sequence="12">Donelle N. Breese 17 eines is beautiful, wild, and also very dangerous. It is not nature that is depicted as dangerous, but rather the colonizers who attempt to abuse and destroy the land and her people. In the poem "Tear," for example, Hogan gives the title word double meaning in order to describe the dresses the women in her tribe wore and the historical removal that devastated her ancestors on the western pathway known as the Trail of Tears. Tear dresses they were called because settler cotton was torn in straight lines like the roads we had to follow to Oklahoma. But when the cloth was torn, it was like tears, impossible to hold back, and so they were called by this other name, for our weeping. (59) The settler cotton torn in straight lines, like the straight roads to Oklahoma and the streaming tears nmning down the faces of the people forced to march this harrowing path, is the cloth of the colonizer. The term "tear" in one definition suggests a rupture or split and reminds Hogan's readers of the separations her ancestors underwent during the events surrounding the Trail of Tears. Separations from family members, homes, tribal regions, from their ways of life, their languages and identities are just a few of the various forms of human and cultural fractures that are a result of the colonial process. The specific landscape from which a tribe derives deter mines its means for survival, its cultural symbols, its sense of self and its spirituality; therefore, removal from these landscapes initiates a split from many other aspects of the tribe's way of life. In "Landscape, History, and the Pueblo Imagination," Leslie Marmon Silko describes this centrality of landscape and place within oral tradition: As offspring of the Mother Earth, the ancient Pueblo people could not conceive of themselves without a specific landscape. Location, or "place," nearly always plays a central role in the Pueblo oral narra tives. Indeed, stories are most frequently recalled as people are pass ing by a specific geographical feature or the exact place where a story takes place. (269)</page><page sequence="13">18 SAIL 11.4 Winter 1999. The diversity of the landscape of what we now call North America has contributed greatly in creating a diversity of Native American cultures, sharing some fundamental ideologies in their worldviews, but ultimately demonstrating a highly pluralistic existence in practice and worship. In The Book of Medicines, the poems with water imagery are compel ling in expressing Hogan's equation of the subjugation of women with the exploitation of the landscape and Native American cultures. While in "Tear" the water imagery navigates readers through the flood of sorrow caused by the history of cultural displacements, much of the time the water imagery signifies birth, hope, cleansing, unpolluted earth, and heal ing. This aquatic medicine in Hogan's work has many different healing purposes. The healing comes about through loving, in remembering the past, in telling the stories, in writing the words, and in respecting the earth and the wisdom that it provides. The final poem in The Book of Medi cines, entitled "Flood: The Sheltering Tree," describes the image of Hogan standing beneath the only tree existing on a mound where water keeps slowly rising as "Land takes back the forgotten name of rain / and speaks it / like a roar, dark and running / away from breaking sky" (85). This rain is the tears of her people washing the wound and cleansing the land so that they can see again "the beautiful unwinding field / and remember [their] lives / from before the time of science, / before [they] fell from history" (85). There is a nostalgic mood evoked with a longing for a time when Chickasaw culture was alive and thriving. This was a time when the earth still had wide-open spaces and before European settlers brought their philosophies. In The Book of Medicines, Hogan has created for herself a spiritual space with water as the primary ingredient needed to heal and reconnect her with her cultural heritage. Ironically, water is also the primary ingredi ent she uses to describe portrayals of environmental injustice, racism and sexism. The aquatic intelligence permeating her poems emphasizes the spiritual perspectives from which Hogan writes. In recognizing that intel ligence, Hogan accepts the responsibility that accompanies it?that we all need to behave as custodians of the planet and work harder to protect the earth and its inhabitants, terrestrial or aquatic. Conclusion Part of the decolonization effort for many Native Americans involves a recovery of lost stories and cultural practices, but part of that effort in volves imagination and invention also. Most of the landscapes that Hogan's ancestors inhabited are so severely altered by technology and</page><page sequence="14">Donelle N.Dreese 19 progress that a return to place can only be metaphorical or imaginative. There also have been so much assimilation and cultural exchange that a return to cultural "purity" would be impossible. Because of this profound assimilation, the decolonization process is often highly nostalgic and spiri tual. This does not, however, make the process or outcome any less real. Being in the world is as much a psychological act as a physical one. And for many Native American cultures, time and space had been fluid multidi mensional spheres rather than linear planes. Experiences gained through the power of the mind and the imagination rank equally with physical experience. In Grandmothers of the Light, Paula Gunn Allen speaks of this phe nomenon as "the plasticity of time in the universe of power." The uni verse of power is a place, she describes, where the sources of magic and transformation reside. In this passage she compares the ordinary world and the universe of power: In the ordinary world, we get from one place to another by walking, running, riding on animals, or riding or flying in machines ? But in the universe of power we, our signals, and our objects can traverse great or small distances with the speed at which a message can pres ently be sent over a fax machine. Objects and subjects alike can be transported through solid matter?windows, walls, stone buttresses, or mountains?and they are as independent of gravity as of other physical constraints. (17) The universe of power is a place of much greater agency than the ordinary world. It is a place where painful memories of colonization and betrayal can be transcended. The spiritual and psychological power of this uni verse enables one to forego and transform the difficulties of the physical, ordinary world. Consequently, the universe of power is a great healer. While viewing aspects of the environment with spiritual reverence as nothing less than kin and often as the embodiments of gods or figures of great wisdom, many Native American cultures have evolved from tradi tions that care for the landscape with respect and reciprocity. That which is taken is returned through prayer, ritual, and ceremony to maintain the delicate balance upon which all life rests. Abuse or poisoning of the land would inevitably lead to a disruption of that balance, which would in turn cause physical and spiritual pain and suffering for the life which inhabits it. As Paula Gunn Allen has observed, "it is the loss of harmony, an inner world imbalance, that reveals itself in physical or psychological ailment. It</page><page sequence="15">20 SAIL 11.4 Winter 1999. also plays itself out in social ailments, war, dictatorship, elitism, classism, sexism, and homophobia" (168). Realistically, it has been historically in conceivable to Western modes of thought to suggest such an all-encom passing connection between the environment and the state of human existence as viable. Ecocriticism, much like some American Indian phi losophies, promotes and teaches the interdependence and connected ness of all living things, which means that any study of human existence would be insufficient without placing humans within an environmental context. Hogan is aware of the individual's sense of the fluidity of place as an exterior force with profound effects on the interior sense of well being. We are our environments. We take in, physically and psychologically, our surroundings, and they become part of who we are. Place and the self are not separate entities, which is why Hogan's explorations of her cul ture, childhood, and gender pivot around an environmental center. As activist texts, Dwellings and The Book of Medicines demand the relation ship between men and women, and that between humanity and non-hu man nature, be reconsidered and transformed. The subjugation of nature has resulted in the prevailing ecological crisis, and the subjugation of women has resulted in a continuing debasement of women. (Domestic violence, rape, anorexia nervosa, lower employment salaries, and unreal istic standards of beauty through media forms are serious symptoms.) One of the goals of ecofeminism as expressed by Ynestra King in "Heal ing the Wounds: Feminism, Ecology, and the Nature/Culture Dualism," is to genuinely and actively seek an antidualistic philosophy in Western culture as another stage of human evolution called "rational enchant ment." This "rational enchantment" will involve "a new way of being human on this planet with a sense of the sacred, informed by all ways of knowing?intuitive and scientific, mystical and rational" (120). The ter restrial and aquatic intelligence in Linda Hogan's poetry demonstrates this way of being human that embraces the sacred and validates intan gible forms of knowledge. The project of Western patriarchy thus far has been to construct a civilization in which it has been understood that antithetical epistemolo gies cannot coexist. This paradigm is rationalized by those in power in order for them to maintain their position, and to sustain the subjugation and oppression of women, nature, and marginalized cultures. One cannot stifle, however, the human desire for connection?to oneself, to others, to a certain place. One also cannot stifle the human need and quest for safety?to live on a sustainable planet without worrying about what is in</page><page sequence="16">Donelle Breese 21 the eight glasses of water we should be drinking every day. Ecocriticism and ecoferninist theories are valid approaches to literary studies because they attempt to diffuse assumptions and behaviors that have tenured the Western power paradigm in terms of gender, culture and capitalist progress. The world is clearly in a state of environmental crisis. The more problems escalate, the more there is a need for theories that address different ways of approaching how we live within the world and amongst one another. An appropriate quote comes from Wendell Berry's The Unsettling of America-, "we can make ourselves whole only by accepting our partiality, by living within our limits, by being human?not by trying to be gods" (95). Our existing approaches to being in the world need to be modified, and our values need to be seriously reconsidered. Caring more for the other does not mean caring for the selfless. It means recognizing one's position within the multitude of life forms in the universe and taking some responsibility for their well being. If one is not safe, none of us are.
