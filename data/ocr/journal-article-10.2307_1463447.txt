<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Journal of the American Academy of Religion, XLVIII/4 Darwinism between Kant and Haeckel Hans Schwarz ABSTRACT This paper attempts to describe and evaluate the major proponents of evolutionary thought in nineteenth-century German Protestantism. It shows that the soil was well prepared for Darwin's ideas, many of his theses having been advocated in Germany prior to the publication of his Origin of Species. While the mainstream of evolutionary thought in Germany was quite antireligious in terms of the established religion, evolutionists still admitted to being at a loss to explain the relationship between the own self and matter. The author concludes that we cannot choose between Kant or Hegel, the main philosophical mentors of German nineteenth-century evolutionists, but must learn from both. Such a venture would meet the hope of Haeckel to bridge the dichotomy between dualism and monism through a comprehensive monistic view. Hans Schwarz is Edward C. Fendt Professor of Systematic Theology at Trinity Lutheran Seminary, Columbus, Ohio. His publications include The Search for God (1975), Our Cosmic Journey (1977), On the Way to the Future (rev. ed. 1979), and articles in English, German, and Hungarian.</page><page sequence="2">582 Hans Schwarz T he nineteenth century was an age of scientific optimism. In the great scientific advancements which marked the century, it was not the vast development of knowledge of physics, and still less the enormous superstructure of industry raised on that knowledge, which most effectually widened humanity's mental horizon and led to one more revolution in our ways of thought. "The point of real interest shifted from astronomy to geology, and from physics to biology and the phenomena of life" (Dampier:252). Here Charles Darwin-the Newton of biology-stands out as the central figure of the nineteenth century. In dealing with the significance of evolutionary thought for nineteenth- century German Protestantism, the main part of our paper will be devoted to the impact of Darwin. But in Germany, as well as in England, evolutionary thinking did not start with Darwin./1/ We will therefore take a brief look at the great philosophers of the late eigh- teenth and early nineteenth centuries who provided the philosophical framework for nineteenth-century evolutionary thought, then proceed to pre-Darwinian materialistic monism, which anticipated many of the central ideas of later Darwinism. Finally, we will deal briefly with the impact of Darwin on German evolutionary thought. The Philosophical Framework for Evolutionary Thought Martin Ka*hler claims in his Geschichte der protestantischen Dogmatik im 19. Jahrhundert that the reason for the easy adjustment to evolution- ary thinking in Germany was due to the fact that most theologians were Hegelians. Hegel, however, Kaihler suggests, completely anticipated Darwin (100). Yet we should not overlook the impact of Kant on evolutionary thought. We remember that Immanuel Kant strictly distin- guished between the natural and the metaphysical realms of knowledge, restricting empirical investigation to the phenomenal realm, while rele- gating the noumenal to practical reason (Zbickler:360). In so doing he denied that metaphysical dogmatism had any say in the scientific investigation of nature. The empirical approach of science, with its inductive procedure, gained priority and any a priori speculation about nature came secondary. The overambitious teleological approach toward nature advanced by Leibniz and Wolff was rejected as illegitimate. Apart from this fundamental distinction, advanced most forcefully in his Critique of Pure Reason (1781), Kant made some significant suggestions concerning the evolutionary process. In his lectures Von den verschiede- nen Rassen der Menschen (1775), he traces the human races back to four main branches and claims that these four branches are derivatives (Abartungen) of a central branch (Stammgattung) which is either extinct or resembles very closely one of the present branches (1968). He does not assume, however, that this main branch can still be discovered somewhere on earth in its original, unchanged form, because nature</page><page sequence="3">Darwinism 583 everywhere adjusts over many generations to its environment. Nowa- days humankind appears everywhere in local modifications. With these remarks Kant advocates an evolutionary development of humanity. More than twenty years later, in his Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht abgefasst (1798), he again suggests an evolutionary advance- ment of humanity, now, however, beyond the present stage of humani- ty to its destiny. Kant says that "only through a progression in a sequence of unspecified many generations can the human race advance to its destiny. Thereby the goal is always envisioned, and, while the tendency toward this final destiny may be hindered occasionally, it can never be totally reversed" (1968:676)./2/ Kant comes close here to Teilhard's notion that amid manifold errors and trials an irresistible evolutionary progression pushes ahead towards a destined goal, which Teilhard names the omega point. In assuming a human destiny, Kant comes close to assuming a teleological force at work. In his Critique of Judgment (1790) he explains the evolutionary process in greater detail. Though he holds it contrary to reason that life could have sprung from lifeless matter and that matter should have been able to disguise itself in the form of self-maintaining purposiveness (1951:274),/3/ he leaves it to the archeologists of nature to derive from the surviving traces of evolution, according to all its mechanism known or supposed by them, the emergence of the great family of creatures (1951). They could show how from the womb of nature the living creatures emerged. For instance, they could show that certain water animals transform them- selves gradually into marsh animals and these, after some generations, into land animals. When we come to Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, we notice that he does not distinguish between the noumenal and the phenomenal, since the whole phenomenal realm is witness and expression of God./4/ Though there is a notion of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, through which things or ideas move and have impulse and activity, there is no actual contradiction within the dialectic; it is only a coming back to itself. Thus all objects are not actual objects, but parts of the whole. Consequently one may classify this philosophy of progressive wholeness as a kind of mystic pantheism (Hirschberger:379). We are not surprised that Hegel shows much openness toward a philosophy of nature. Already in his dissertation of 1801 (De Orbitis Planetarum) he concerns himself with cosmological theories (1970c). In his Enzyklopdidie der philosophischen Wissenschaften im Grundrisse (1817) he devoted a whole section to a philosophy of nature. The concern with wholeness becomes evident again when we hear that the idea decides to allow nature to go forth freely from itself (1970a:393) and that "Nature has surrendered itself as the Idea in the form of otherness" (1970b:24), and that nature is the "unresolved contradiction" (1970b:28). After dealing with mechan- ics and physics, Hegel devotes his last part of the philosophy of nature to "organic physics," passing from geological nature through vegetable</page><page sequence="4">584 Hans Schwarz nature to animal organism. He asserts that life as an idea is movement of itself through which it elevates itself to its own subject. It is only from the animal kingdom onward, however, that life as such is present, because life's main destiny is subjectivity (1970b:340). Hegel provides us with a wealth of geological information, showing that the earth had a history of successive changes. Especially the many fossils of plants, trees, and animals point to a distant past and immense evolutions, perhaps caused by cosmic changes (1970b:345). Hegel, however, claims that the empirical history of the earth that geology discovers, though interesting, is not the most interesting one. His concern lies with that which is. When we come to the animal kingdom, Hegel perceives in the animal a true being, a being for itself which attains individuality and distinguishes itself from the common substance of the earth (1970b: 434). While Hegel notices a development within the animal kingdom, from simpler forms of organization to more perfect ones, he does not pursue this idea (1970b:500). Hegel concludes his Enzyklopdidie saying: "The purpose of these lectures is to provide a picture of nature, to conquer this Proteus, to find only a mirror of ourselves in these external matters, to perceive in nature a free reflection of the Spirit-to know God, not in viewing the spirit, but in this his immediate pres- ence" (1970b:539). Ernst Bloch is right when he observes that Hegel is in a hurry to leave nature; that he has no actual appreciation for the surrounding being of the world (1951). Nature is an "unresolved contradiction," we have heard from Hegel. The progressive drive does not come from nature, it comes from the spirit. This is the point that all later materialistic monists forgot when they made use of Hegel's uniform system. But can we really fault them for this, if for Hegel nature has only ancillary status? Turning to Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, who was appointed to the University of Berlin in 1841 by Friedrich Wilhelm IV to eradicate "the dragon's seed of Hegelian pantheism" (1960:344), we notice an even greater interest in a philosophy of nature than with Hegel./5/ In his Ideen zu einer Philosophie der Natur (1797) he claimed in opposition to Fichte's idealism that nature is as important and as real as the ego. Yet nature is not that real either. In The Ages of the World (1815), for instance, he asserts that in comparison with the Godhead, which alone truly is, nature "is like a nothing, a mere play which does not claim reality" (1967:169). But hearing further that "everything divine is human, and everything human divine" and that "this phrase was and still is the key to the greatest discoveries in the realm of God and nature" (1967:179), we begin to wonder. Schelling himself gives us a clue to the kind of philosophy that is behind his approach when he asks: "Have those who thought they could straight away compare the unity asserted by us with the Spinozistic unity, never noticed the concept of potencies, which even by itself includes the concept of development, of movement? Yet if one considers in what directions philosophy has split before and after</page><page sequence="5">Darwinism 585 Spinoza, and how all concepts have separated, then one cannot help recognizing in Spinoza the sole son and heir of true science throughout the entire modern period" (1967:230f.). In his philosophy of identity Schelling does not simply divinize nature. He rather affirms that after science has analyzed all the forces in nature it still has not compre- hended the one force that makes all other forces possible and opera- tive./6/ While Schelling is able to affirm the basic coherence of nature even more than was possible in Hegel's dialectic, there is in his system also the danger of forgetting that entity which endows nature with coherence. He almost anticipates materialistic monism when he declares that the principles of organisms and the principles of mechanisms are the same. And sixty years before Darwin, he already declared that the sequence of steps of all organic beings was brought about through gradual development of one and the same form of organization (Zieg- ler:76). Now the stage was set for the pre-Darwinian materialistic monism. Pre-Darwinian Materialistic Monism In briefly describing the main points of German pre-Darwinian materialistic monism, we could cite many names. Yet we will confine ourselves to those three representatives who were most influential in advocating a materialistic and monistic worldview, namely Ludwig Btich- ner, Carl Vogt, and Jacob Moleschott, who also advanced evolutionary thought. Ludwig Btichner's Force and Matter (1855; Eng. trans., 1870) indi- cates in its title the two main components of materialistic monism, force and matter. In the second part of the nineteenth century Biichner's book was the most widely read popular philosophical German book. By 1904 it was in its twenty-first edition and translated into all major languages (Hirsch:585f.). Ludwig Btichner, a physician in Darmstadt, rejects the notion of a life force in the world and, while conceding that the details of the origin of the first organic matter are still unknown, claims that the world of organisms was caused by the natural conditions of external nature (1859:xxxvii, xliii). He observes that there is always a certain relationship between the environmental conditions and the existence of certain forms of organic life (1859:63f.). Earlier forms disappear and new ones emerge as the external conditions change. When the earth was still a primordial fireball, it was without organic life and even hostile to organic life. While Bdichner assumes that occasional- ly there still may be spontaneous generation of life today (1859:70), we notice that he is somewhat evasive as to the origin of life. He knows from fossil findings that lower forms of life are usually earlier and that from them the ascent to further development occurred (1859:75). When he states that in their embryonic development different species resemble each other so much that one can explain this by a common history of</page><page sequence="6">586 Hans Schwarz origin, he anticipates what Haeckel called the fundamental biogenetic law. Any notion of a development from design is abandoned when Btichner says: "Nature attains many of the alleged purposes after a long and laborious detour. But one cannot deny that these purposes (Zwec- ke), if it were only important to achieve them, could have been attained so much easier and simpler" (1859:104). But Btichner replaces the idea of a goal-directing force outside nature with an even stronger force within nature, namely the natural laws. The laws, according to which nature is active, are eternal and unchangeable. "An inflexible, unrelent- ing necessity governs mass" (1859:33). Since humanity is a product of nature according to its bodily and spiritual existence, everything that it is, does, wills, senses, and thinks is governed by the same natural necessities as the whole structure of the world (1859:238)./7/ If nature is that determinative, we are not surprised to hear that matter is immortal, without beginning and end in space, and that force is equally immortal (1859:23). Btichner concludes: "Today the immortality of matter is a scientifically proven and no longer deniable fact" (1859:13). It is not surprising that there is hardly a place for God in Btichner's system. If God is held eternal, we are told, this is only a different expression for the eternity of the world (1874:18). Especially the purposiveness of nature had to be rejected to disclaim the idea of a creative God. In analogy to Kant, Biichner argues that the notion of a purpose is introduced by reflective reason, but it cannot be deduced from nature (1874:25f.). For instance, a deer does not have long legs to run fast, but it can run fast because it has long legs. As soon as Dar- win's thesis of nondirectional "mutations" became known it was eagerly picked up to substantiate these claims. The world was no longer the best possible world, but a world of turmoil and imperfections. Yet in advocating "atheism or philosophical monism" Btichner does not resign to fate. Since the motifs of our ethos are no longer dependent on an other-worldly God, this monism of nature leads to "freedom, reason, progress, recognition of man and of true humanity-with one word-it leads to humanism" (1874:46). While the monistic understanding of the world, advocated by Btichner, proved to be especially attractive to common people, others remembered that one could not that easily do away with the Kantian distinction between the world as phenomenon and the world as "thing-in-itself" (Frauenstiidt:44f.). Had not Arthur Schopenhauer, who felt himself the true disciple of Kant, claimed that "materialism is the philosophy of the subject that forgets to take account of itself" (176)? Can there really be an object without a subject and therefore ultimate objectivity? Friedrich Albert Lange in his classic History of Materialism and Criticism of Its Present Importance (1866; Eng. trans., 1877) conceded that materialism was a scientific method of investigation (499f.). But he rejected the metaphysical implications of materialism since he affirmed that we have to restrict our assertions to the world of the phenomena while the thing-in-itself is withdrawn from sense experience.</page><page sequence="7">Darwinism 587 As Carl Vogt, Kdhlerglaube und Wissenschaft. Eine Streitschrift gegen Hofrath Rudolf Wagner in Gi'ttingen (1854) proved, it was difficult to argue with the representatives of materialistic monism. While Btichner had attacked Justus Liebig quite frequently in Force and Matter, Carl Vogt, professor of zoology in Giessen and later in Geneva, now attacked Rudolf Wagner in the same debate on materialism. Rudolf Wagner had dared to claim the possibility of the descent of humanity from one couple and also affirmed the existence of an immortal soul (Vogt:49f.). In juxtaposing Kdhlerglaube (backwoods faith) and Wissen- schaft (science) Vogt indicated how unwilling he was to take the other side seriously. Vogt claims that the fossils found in excavations demon- strate that humanity is not the last species that appeared on earth. Many of its contemporaries gave way to other species. Scientific investigation also shows that the different races of humanity could not possibly stem from one couple. Vogt arrives at the conclusion that "the teachings of Scripture about Adam and Noah and the twofold origin of mankind, each time from one couple, are, scientifically speaking, untenable fairy tales" (83). Science also proves for Vogt that human existence is a transitory one, after which no other life will follow (122). Again monistic materialism is seen as a kind of liberation. Since our short stay on earth will not be terminated by some kind of "sinister vengeance," we can live as equals and enjoy the pleasures of life./8/ When we now turn briefly to Jacob Moleschott's Der Kreislauf des Lebens (1852), we notice that he radicalized most of the issues intro- duced by Btichner and Vogt. We are not.surprised that Btichner confesses that Moleschott stimulated him to write Force and Matter. The cause and effect sequence is so dominating for Moleschott that it does not tolerate any kind of ultimate dependence once suggested by Schlei- ermacher. "Research therefore excludes revelation" (1855:18; 1875:7; Btichner, 1859:xlii, footnote)./9/ The omnipotence of the creator of the world stands in irreconcilable opposition to the laws of nature. Revela- tion and knowledge are related to each other like fiction to truth; the one guesses where the other researches (1887). Truth can only be gained from nature and its course. The essence of a thing is the sum of its properties, and the essence of all properties is force. But force is not a pushing God, not an essence of things separated from its material foundation; it is the inexorable property of matter indwelling since eternity. For both Moleschott and Btichner force and matter are identi- cal. There is just one that is immortal-matter. The unchangeability of matter is the foundation for the eternal cycle of nature, of origin and decay (Moleschott, 1875:35). Moleschott finds the immortality of matter affirmed by Julius Robert Mayer's law of the conservation of energy, which states that in an energetically closed system the amount of energy remains constant (Moleschott, 1887:608f.). Moleschott is right when he observes that by changing from one form of energy to another no energy is lost. We might even agree with him when he claims that</page><page sequence="8">588 Hans Schwarz energy is as indestructible as matter. Yet we wonder why he completely ignores the law of entropy or the nonconvertibility of energy which Clausius introduced in 1851. Thus Moleschott can claim that "in the universe the amount of force remains always the same . . . . The sum total of energy and the living force in the universe remains always the same" (1887:609). Mass is part of the eternal process. While Buichner was still uncertain, it was clear for Moleschott in 1887 that the first organism was formed through spontaneous generation (1887:593). Moleschott is certain that even if we were never able experimentally to reproduce spontaneous generation, the assertion that life on earth had sprung up from inanimate matter would not be affected. Humanity is part of the evolutionary process, having ascended via the primeval cell, the monkeys, and the anthropoid apes. Since the whole evolutionary process started with inorganic matter and evolved toward humanity, humanity is understood in strictly materialistic terms. "There is no thought without phosphorus, without grease, and without water" is Moleschott's verdict (1887:599). "Speech, style, attempts and conclu- sions, good actions and crimes, courage and hesitation and treason, they are all natural phenomena, and, as much as the revolutions of the globe they stand as necessary consequences in a direct relationship to indis- pensable causes" (1887:606). Humans are the sum total of parents, space and time, air and weather, food and dress. Since there are so many influences on humanity, it is a constantly developing natural product (1887:608). Suddenly, however, Moleschott breaks out of the consistent determinism he has set up. Though all our knowledge stems from our senses, and though the history of human education is the developmental history of our sense, Moleschott now declares that "man is the measure of all things for man" (1887:583). Since we are always in becoming, we can always strive for betterment. And indeed, he con- fesses, "the moral and spiritual activity of mankind is constantly devel- oping" (1887:613). In his appeal to humanity to realize the new opportunities of monistic materialism, Moleschott implicitly goes beyond a strictly monistic view and distinguishes between ego and world. This relationship between the own self and matter is precisely the issue that, in spite of their fervent assertions, pre-Darwinian materialistic monists did not seem to have resolved when they proposed their coherent view of the world (Ziegler:350). Though we do not want to classify Ludwig Feuerbach as a material- ist monist, we must at least parenthetically mention him. While he was preoccupied more with a philosophy of religion than with a philosophy of nature, his thoughts were deeply influenced by evolutionary thinking. In his treatise Das Wesen der Religion (1845) he postulated in his usual manner that religion is founded upon the feeling of dependence (1971:4). God is the highest or most powerful being, and he can achieve what humans cannot do. He is the eternal being (12f.). God is also the First Cause and serves as a hypothesis to solve the problem of the</page><page sequence="9">Darwinism 589 origin of nature or rather of organic life (18). It is the power of God that sustains us. But, Feuerbach asks, "we are placed amid nature, and nevertheless our beginning, our origin is supposed to lie beyond nature? We live in nature, with nature, and from nature, and at the same time we should not be from it? What a contradiction" (19)! Indeed, Feuer- bach concludes, the fundamental concept of God as distinguished from humanity is none other than nature (12). Contrary to his mentor Hegel, he now asserts that the deduction of the world from God, or of nature from the spirit, is only a logical game (29). Religion, therefore, has as its presupposition a dichotomy or contradiction between willing and ability, desire and accomplishment, idea and reality (34). The traditional understanding of faith in God is the anthropomorphic phenomenon of faith in nature. But Feuerbach wants this faith to be faith in the human being as a being in and of nature (1971:70f.)./10/ In attempting to dissolve God into nature, Feuerbach does not want to advocate a divinization of nature. On the contrary, Feuerbach argues, "the power of nature is not unlimited like divine omnipotence, i.e., the power of human imagination; it cannot accomplish everything at will at any time and under any circumstances; its evolvements and actions are tied to certain conditions" (20f.). This postulate provides for him the starting point for his evolutionary ideas. Geology has proved that the earth has undergone a series of developments until it arrived at its present state (19ff.). The origin and development of organic life is intimately tied to the evolution of earth. But earth did not first provide the conditions for the origin of life or of the human species as some kind of Garden of Eden in which life or the human species originated. Yet as soon as the conditions were such that life or humanity could originate, they origi- nated. Therefore, the argument is wrong which claims that, since today life is not spontaneously generated, it could not have originated in the past from inanimate matter. Nowadays environmental conditions are different, and the earth is in a state of stability. Yet this does not imply for Feuerbach that today the evolutionary thrust has been lost. Feuer- bach's claim of dissolving God into nature is proposing an evolutionary progression. If humanity is no longer for nature, nature can be for humanity; it can attain self-determination, dignity, and power./1l/ Remembering, however, that, in a preface to Jacob Moleschott's Lehre der Nahrungsmittel: Fiir das Volk (1850), Feuerbach wrote five years later that "man is what he eats," we doubt whether Feuerbach has succeeded in determining any better the relationship between ego and world than the monistic materialists. The Impact of Darwin When we now venture to assess the impact of Darwin on evolution- ary thought in Germany, we must admit that the stage was amazingly well prepared. As we have seen from the writings prior to Darwin, the</page><page sequence="10">590 Hans Schwarz main arguments in favor of a comprehensive evolutionary worldview did not come from biology itself. It was rather geology, partly in connection with biological research, partly by itself, that paved the way for evolu- tionary theories (Zoickler:581f.). Geology opened the understanding for the immense aeons necessary for biological change, and, providing a variety of fossils, it also allowed for the understanding of the actual changes that were involved. Of the many interesting pre-Darwinian theories, we want to men- tion just a few. For example, Heinrich Friedrich Link, Die Urwelt und das Altertum erliiutert durch die Naturkunde (1821), assumed forty years before Haeckel that the ape could be considered the historical link between animals and humans (Zbickler:604f.). He claimed that the Negroes were the primal form of the human race and the whites were a degeneration of the Negroes. Similarly to Haeckel, he was looking for the cradle of humanity not in Asia or Africa but on a lost continent between India and East Africa. Other evolutionary theories were pro- posed by Dr. Vollmer in his Natur- und Sittengemiilde der Tropenliinder (1828), in which he postulated the gradual development of the living species, including humanity, from formless matter. One should also mention the work of Karl Ernst von Baer, Uber die Entwicklungsge- schichte der Tiere; Beobachtung und Reflexion (vol. 1, 1828), who was the first to discover what Haeckel later called the fundamental biogenetic law. Baer observed that during their embryonic development higher animals recapitulate the lower stages of life. Yet this recapitulation is not an exact repetition, only a similar one. Just mentioning these few naturalists, we get the impression that Darwin's theories should not have taken anyone by surprise. Otto Zdckler even claims that each year since the middle of the 1840s several scientific monographs or textbooks in different fields anticipated the Darwinian theories (613). The stage was so well prepared for Darwin's theories that as soon as his main concepts became known many of his German followers immediately surpassed him with regard to the conse- quences they reached for evolutionary thought. In their exuberance they did not even shy away from gross scientific exaggerations and distor- tions. Carl Vogt, for instance, claimed that an important link between humans and apes was the microcephalics or idiots from birth. They are examples for a pathologically abnormal formation leading back to the anthropoid apes as our predecessors. Under heavy attacks, however, Carl Vogt had to withdraw his theory in 1872, admitting that he had never anatomically investigated a microcephalic brain. While there were also some moderate approaches to Darwin the most forceful and lasting influence of Darwinian ideas in Germany, picking up the pre-Darwinian monistic tendencies, came from David Friedrich Strauss and Ernst Haeckel. At first glance it may seem inappropriate to begin our review of monistic tendencies in German Darwinism with David Friedrich Strauss.</page><page sequence="11">Darwinism 591 He seems to be much more an advocate of Hegelian philosophy than of Darwinian thought. In Die christliche Glaubenslehre in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung und im Kampfe mit der modernen Wissenschaft dargestellt (vol. 1, 1840) he indeed portrays strict Hegelian methodology, dividing each section into thesis, antithesis, and synthesis (616). He affirms with Hegel that the Absolute is essentially result; it is only in the end that the whole of reality emerges (643). Evolutionary or progressive thinking is therefore the very center of his understanding of the relationship between God and his creation. He is convinced that all organic beings evolved in successive layers from inanimate matter (681f.). Only gradu- ally did our planet obtain its present form. There was a creative force in our planet which sustained the created and mediated the sustenance of higher forms of life through procreation. The human origin, of course, was part of the natural process (685f.). But Strauss assures us that neither the polygenetic origin of humanity nor the naturalness of its origin would impair the notion of the unity of humanity and the notion of God the Creator. While Strauss does not show an awareness of an actual evolutionary process in the strict sense, he is convinced of a natural progression of nature. When we now turn to The Old Faith and the New: A Confession (1871; Eng. trans. of 6th ed., 1873), which was published one year after Darwin's Descent of Man, we cannot but realize the amazing impact the Darwinian theory had on Strauss. Gone now is the possibility of reconciling the progression of nature with the belief in a Creator. We are told that the only choice is between belief in the divine creative hand or in Darwin's theory (179). "Natural science," he declares, "has long since attempted to put in place of the concept of creation, which is foreign to it, the concept of evolution. The Englishman Charles Darwin now made the first scientific attempt to take this concept seriously and to exemplify it in the whole realm of life" (178). Of course, he admits, Darwin was not the first to suggest this theory. Most other proponents of this theory, however, had too many parts missing in it to introduce it as a convincing and comprehensive theory. While Strauss concedes that Darwin points toward more possible solutions than he actually provides, Strauss is convinced Darwin has introduced the evolutionary process so convincingly that a happier posterity can now discard forever the miracle of creation (180f.). Thus Strauss declares Darwin as one of the greatest benefactors of humanity. For progressive natural science of today, an intelligent architect of the organism or even a purposiveness of nature which one could understand as the work of an intelligent creator is no longer tenable (216ff.). Even human instincts are gradually acquired through natural selection. This shows, for Strauss, the amazing gap between the old worldview and the new one. Yet he does not hold the details of Darwin's theory to be that surprising. He argues, for instance, that "Darwin's 'struggle for existence' is nothing but expanded to a natural principle what we have known long as a social and industrial</page><page sequence="12">592 Hans Schwarz principle . . .. competition" (190). Of course Strauss realizes that some people might find humanity's descent from apes offensive (199). But he questions whether it would be so much better to be created in the image of God and then be thrown out of paradise, and still today not have regained the status we once had. For some people, he says, even a failure who is from a good family is more respectable than someone who, through his/her own efforts, has made it in life. According to the evolutionary theory humanity did not start high to fall so far immediate- ly afterward. On the contrary, it started low to move slowly but steadily higher and higher (230). Humanity is part of the ascending movement of life (245ff.). In it nature reflects itself, Strauss declares in accordance with his master Hegel. Though humans are still natural beings they sublimated the higher goal which is implanted in them. Humanity should understand and dominate nature, not as a tyrant but as humans. While these assertions about the human "destiny" may be interpreted as resembling teleological thought, it is evident for Strauss that the evolutionary theory is in opposition to any "dualistic" Christian under- standing of the world. This theory endeavors to explain the whole of phenomena from one single, monistic principle (212f.). Confronted with Christianity, both materialism and idealism are monistic. Their common enemy is dualism. While idealism attempts to explain the world from above, materialism attempts to explain it from below, and ultimately one leads to the other. We are not wrong to conclude that Darwin's theory of the development of the species through natural selection brought for Strauss the solution to the great enigmas of the world (Ziegler:357). When we now come to Ernst Haeckel, professor of zoology at the University of Jena, we are dealing with the man who in regard to evolutionary thought had perhaps the deepest impact on German Prot- estantism. Different from Btichner, Vogt, and Moleschott, he was a scholar in his own right who made his own significant contributions to the theory of evolution. His popular books, The History of Creation (1868; Eng. trans., 1876) and The Riddle of the Universe (1899; Eng. trans., 1900), were bestsellers on the German market and translated into many languages. About Haeckel's The History of Creation Charles Darwin remarks in his Descent of Man: "If this work had appeared before my essay had been written, I should probably never have completed it. Almost all the conclusions at which I have arrived I find confirmed by this naturalist, whose knowledge on many points is much fuller than mine" (3)./12/ As we will see at several points, most of Haeckel's thoughts, however, can be traced back to earlier thinkers, such as Giordano Bruno, Spinoza, Leibniz, Feuerbach, and others (Hirsch:590; Zbickler:669). Haeckel's monistic worldview is nothing new, but under the impact of the theory of a uniform evolution, it gains in precision and persuasion.</page><page sequence="13">Darwinism 593 Already in his two-volume work The History of Creation, Haeckel ends on a highly optimistic note. He finds that the mind of the whole human race has gone through a process of slow, gradual, and historical development. "We are proud," he claims, "of having so immensely outstripped our lower animal ancestors, and derive from it the consoling assurance that in the future also, mankind, as a whole, will follow the glorious career of progressive development, and attain a still higher degree of mental perfection" (1876:367). Especially the application of evolutionary thought to practical human life, as begun by Herbert Spencer, opens up "a new road towards moral perfection" (1876:367). Shaping politics, morals, and the principles of justice in accordance with natural laws, and this means with the laws of evolution, will provide "an existence worthy of man, which has been talked of for thousands of years" (1876:368). The strong religious overtones in his scientific and philosophic work are most clearly expressed when he concludes: "The simple religion of Nature, which grows from a true knowledge of Her, and of Her inexhaustible store of revelations, will in future ennoble and perfect the development of mankind far beyond that degree which can possibly be attained under the influence of multifarious religions of the churches of the various nations, -religions resting on a blind belief in the vague secrets and mythical revelations of a sacerdotal caste" (1876:369). In his widely publicized lecture, Monism as Connecting Religion and Science: The Confession of Faith of a Man of Science (1892; Eng. trans., 1895), the religious overtones of his worldview are felt throughout. Haeckel claims a unity of organic and inorganic nature and hereby rejects the distinctions between natural science and humanities (1893: 9f.). While most older religions and philosophical systems are dualistic, distinguishing between God and world, creator and creation, spirit and matter, Haeckel advocates a uniform understanding of all nature. Re- minding us of Feuerbach's position, he claims that in dualistic systems the most fundamental thought is an anthropomorphism. This means humanity devises an anthropomorphous concept of God which is juxtaposed to nature (1893:13ff.). Yet in referring both to Robert Mayer's law of the conservation of energy and to Lavoisier's law of the conservation of matter, and claiming that these two laws merge into the laws of the conservation of substance, Haeckel advocates a monistic worldview. The world is made up of one immortal substance rendering itself immortal (1893:24). Of course, according to Haeckel, the immor- tality of the cosmos makes any personal immortality untenable. The evolutionary theory shows that in the cosmos everything is in flux. Paleontology, comparative anatomy, and ontogeny show us how life developed step by step and how the cosmos emerged from a chaotic primeval state to the present world order (1893:19). Haeckel concedes that one could label this worldview materialism, but he feels the term monism is more appropriate. He does not think that his worldview is</page><page sequence="14">594 Hans Schwarz atheistic in the strict sense, though it is a-theistic, because it does not want to reduce God to "a gaseous vertebrate." "'Our monistic idea of God,"' he declares, "which alone is compatible with today's refined knowledge of nature, recognizes 'God's spirit in all things"' (1893:33). Small wonder that Haeckel seeks support from Giordano Bruno and claims that "among the different systems of pantheism, which for a long time have developed more or less clearly a monistic idea of God, the most complete is the one by Spinoza" (1893:41). Haeckel is so certain of the persuasiveness of his monistic system that he contends that if Kant developed his philosophy now and had at hand all our scientific knowl- edge, his "system of critical philosophy would have evolved very differently and purely monistically" (1893:41, n. 8)./13/ In his most influential book, The Riddle of the Universe, Haeckel's earlier unbridled optimism has been toned down. He confesses at the outset that he is "wholly a child of the nineteenth century" and that his "own command of the various branches of science is uneven and defective" (1900:ix). But he does not desist from presenting us with a monistic worldview, a view of a universe that is infinite and eternal. There is a universal movement of substance in space, we hear, that "takes the form of an eternal cycle or of a periodic process of evolu- tion" (1900:243). The eternal drama of periodic decay and rebirth of cosmic bodies does not stop short of our own solar system. Unlike the monistic pre-Darwinian materialists, Haeckel does not shy away from discussing the issue of entropy or the nonconvertibility of energy to strengthen his point of the eternal movement of the universe. While in any finite system "every attempt to make such a perpetuum mobile must necessarily fail.. . the case is different, however, when we turn to the world at large, the boundless universe that is in eternal movement" (1900:246). Since the universe is infinite, the law of entropy does not affect it; there is no beginning and no end to the universe. Again Haeckel shows much praise for Spinoza's monistic system, so closely resembling his own (1900:290). As once before expressed in Monism Connecting Religion and Sci- ence, Haeckel has a twofold objective: (1) he wants "to give expression to the rational system which is logically forced upon us by the recent progress of science," and (2) he wants to make monism into a connecting link "between religion and science, and thus do away with the antithesis which has been so needlessly maintained between these two branches of the highest activity of the human mind" (1893:7f.; 1900:332). It is interesting that in so doing he also speaks out against Christian ethics, since it is "a very ideal precept, but as useless in practice as it is unnatural" (1900:353). On principle it attacks and despises egotism and exaggerates the love of one's neighbor at the expense of self-love. We may recall that Friedrich Nietzsche has gone further at this point, labelling Christian ethics as morals of slaves, which Nietzsche contrasts with the morals of a master race (Herrenmensch)</page><page sequence="15">Darwinism 595 (Ziegler:635ff.). Yet the greatest surprise awaits us at the conclusion of the book when Haeckel confesses that "only one comprehensive riddle of the universe now remains-the problem of substance" (1900:380). Then he concedes: We grant at once that the innermost character of nature is just as little understood by us as it was by Anaximander and Empedocles twenty-four hundred years ago, by Spinoza and Newton two hundred years ago, and by Kant and Goethe one hundred years ago. We must even grant that this essence of substance becomes more mysterious and enigmatic the deeper we penetrate into the knowledge of its attributes, matter and energy, and the more thoroughly we study its countless phenomenal forms and their evolutions. (1900:380) But Haeckel does not want to end in resignation just because he does not know the "thing-in-itself' that lies behind the knowable phenome- na. Instead he asks us to rejoice in the immense progress which has actually been made by the monistic philosophy of nature. The monism of the cosmos "proclaims the absolute dominion of 'the great eternal iron laws' throughout the universe" (1900:381). Instead of being de- voted to the ideals of God, freedom, and immortality, we can engage in the cult of the true, the good, and the beautiful, "which is the heart of our new monistic religion" (1900:382). Haeckel concludes that he hopes that in the twentieth century the great antithesis between theism and pantheism, vitalism and mechanism can be resolved "by the construc- tion of a system of pure monism" (1900:383). The Riddle of the Universe stands at the close of the nineteenth century. This is indicative of the general outlook of nineteenth-century Protestant thought in Germany. With Friedrich Loofs one could attack the accuracy of some of the scientific arguments that Haeckel uses. One can also argue that Haeckel's monistic worldview is nothing new, it is common to most philosophers in their endeavor to provide a compre- hensive worldview (Lodge:7, 9). With Rudolf Virchow, The Freedom of Science in the Modern State (1877; Eng. trans., 1878), one could also caution that all our knowledge is only in part (13). Virchow suggests that we should confine our hypotheses to the fields for which they were designed and should not expand them to universal principles (18ff.). Against a universal theory of descent Virchow claims that nobody has observed a spontaneous generation of life and that every progress in prehistoric anthropology has only widened the gap between human ancestors and other vertebrates (29). Therefore, Virchow concludes: " We cannot teach, we cannot label it as an achievement of science that man is descended from apes or from any other animal" (31)./14/ Against these objections we must note that Haeckel did not claim originality for his ideas, nor that he had all the answers, nor that his system was without flaws. As we have seen with the earlier materialistic monists, even without the detailed theory of descent he would perhaps not have wanted to abandon his thoroughgoing monism.</page><page sequence="16">596 Hans Schwarz The most understanding and penetrating criticism of a monistic worldview comes implicitly, however, from Emil du Bois-Reymond, professor of physiology at the University of Berlin. Du Bois-Reymond rightly questions whether a demise of Darwinism would be to the advantage of neovitalism (1912:514f.). If it is the task of science to comprehend nature, then it must presuppose that it can be compre- hended. Thus the idea of a special life force is more of a presupposition than of a scientific deduction. Similarly, in his essay Ojber die Grenzen der Naturerkenntnis (1872) he claims, very much as Haeckel did, that the essence of matter and energy remains hidden even to the "omniscient" spirit that Laplace introduced (1916:28f.). Human consciousness too cannot be explained from its material conditions, and it will never be explained from these conditions (1916:33). Du Bois-Reymond concludes that we do not know and we will not be able to know what the essence of matter and energy is and what consciousness is (1916:51). No scientific progress will bring us any further at these points. In an essay on Die sieben Weltriitsel (1880), du Bois-Reymond pursues a similar line of thinking. While we may discover how life originated, what the reason for the teleological appearance of nature is, and how reasonable thinking proceeds, he claims again that the essence of matter and energy, the origin of movement, the origin of consciousness, and the freedom of the will are issues that cannot be solved by science. Human possibilities of knowledge have insurmountable limits (du Bois-Reymond:72)./15/ Though confining himself to the issue of substance, Haeckel had recognized these limits too. Modern science has even more realized the limits of its explanations and confines itself mostly to a functional approach, describing how things function but leaving open what they really are. We can ignore with Haeckel the quest for essence and posit a monistic worldview, though assuming that there might be a "thing-in-itself" behind the world of phenomena. Or we can revert to Kant, distinguishing between the noumenal and the phenomenal. But are our choices limited to an either-or? Did not Haeckel express the hope that the dichotomy between dualism and monism could be bridged in the twentieth century through a comprehensive monistic view? Indeed, we cannot rid our- selves from the understanding that humanity and the cosmos form an inexorable and uniform unity. Humanity is part of nature and in nature. Even in traditional theological terms humanity's hope is not an un- worldly one but hope in a new world to come. Yet the dialectic between humanity and world, matter and spirit is not simply a means to propel the evolutionary process, as Hegel assumed. The two poles are not to be merged, either, as the pre-Darwinian materialistic monists claimed. There is also an over against, a behind and a beyond, as Kant suggested. But this differentiation does not diminish the reality of the phenomenal, making it into a projection of the mind, as some idealists claimed. We would then again be confined just to one dimension, the</page><page sequence="17">Darwinism 597 human mind. Evolutionary thought, which gained momentum in the nineteenth century, and which then for the first time could be substanti- ated on a large scale by the findings of science, has to learn from both Kant and Hegel without totally aligning with one or the other. Kant without Hegel tends towards an idealistic vision, while Hegel without Kant tends towards undifferentiated progression. If we are willing to learn from both, we can and must continue to perceive the world in evolutionary terms, without falling into pitfalls of shallow materialism or utopian dialectic. We will be reminded that the noumenal, though endowing the phenomenal with reality, is beyond the reach of empirical investigation, and we will have to learn that the real progression of history does not come from the movement of matter, but of the spirit. NOTES /1/ Cf. Ritterbush (159-75), who shows that Charles Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, anticipated many of Charles's ideas. /2/ It is noteworthy that this passage does not appear in the first edition of 1798, but only from the second edition onward. (Unless an English edition is referred to in the notes, all translations of quotations are our own). /3/ Ziegler (64) rightly comments that though Kant advocates here a teleological view of nature, the purposiveness of nature is not constitutive for Kant. The only objective principle of explanation for Kant is that of mechanical causality, upon which one may reflect as if its products were caused by a purposive intelligence. Of course, this "as if" philosophy can easily lead to a totally mechanistic worldview, as we will see later with the materialistic monists. /4/ Cf. for the following Hegel, in his introduction to Wissenschaft der Logik (1812) in (1969), esp. pp. 44 and 50. We also notice there a strongly polemical tone against Kant's rejection of speculative philosophy. /5/ The development of Schelling's philosophy and the important changes in his thinking are not relevant for our specific issue. For a good introduction to the development and changes in Schelling's philosophy, cf. Frederick de Wolfe Bolman, Jr., in Schelling, 1967:3-79. /6/ Cf. Schelling (1857:348f.) who affirms the priority of organic thought over mechanistic thought. When he declares, "It is an old fallacy to assume that organization and life cannot be explained on natural principles," we wonder whether he does not ultimately open the door for an all-inclusive naturalistic view of the world, instead of an organic one.</page><page sequence="18">598 Hans Schwarz /7/ Some of Biichner's deterministic conclusions are not without humor for us today. For instance, he surmises that the whole American governmental system and the physical stature of American men and women are perhaps largely due to climatic conditions (241). /8/ The remark about living as equals indicates the socialist tendency in Vogt, a tendency we can observe in Buichner too, when he rejects authoritative faith, monarchism, and the rule of the priests (1874:45). Moleschott (1855:480) becomes even more explicit about the connection between science, which for him means materialism and socialism, when he says: "The natural scientists are the most active workers of the social issue .... Its solution lies in the hand of the natural scientist, the hand which is guided with certainty by sense experi- ence." /9/ Though the fifth edition of Moleschott's work was published after Darwin became known in Germany, we continue to quote from this edition. While in its first editions it was part of the debate on materialism, directed against Justus von Liebig, now it is expanded into a two-volume work and carries forth the materialistic monistic standpoint most forcefully, especially in its summary conclusion at the end of volume 2. Since it does not deal explicitly with Darwin's own theories, we feel it permissible to use this later edition. /10/ Feuerbach declares here that all religions, whether polytheistic or mono- theistic, are nature religions. /11/ Feuerbach (1971:47): "There nature is an object of veneration, here of enjoyment, there man is for nature, here nature is for man, there purpose, here means, there above man, here below." /12/ Darwin also mentions there approvingly the evolutionary thought of Biichner and Vogt. /13/ It should be mentioned parenthetically at least that Haeckel gives great praise to David Friedrich Strauss, because "among the numerous attempts which have been made within the last twenty years to reform religion in a monistic sense, on the basis of advanced scientific knowledge, the by far most important and epoch-making one remains the work by David Friedrich Strauss, Der alte und der neue Glaube" (1893:46). /14/ It should be noted here that, similarly to Ztickler, Virchow discerns a close and dangerous relationship between the theory of descent and socialism (12). For further details on the dispute between Haeckel and Virchow, especially on the issue of the relationship between socialism and the theory of descent, cf. the excellent book by Ernst Benz (96ff.). The idea of an upward slanting continuing evolutionary process provided a main stimulus for socialist reform claims. We should also remember that both Karl Marx and Friedrich Hegel were familiar with the works of Darwin and felt that his works established the basis for their theory in natural history (Benz:83ff.).</page><page sequence="19">Darwinism 599 /15/ Du Bois-Reymond brings forth these arguments with special reference to David Friedrich Strauss, whose position was still not sceptical enough for du Bois-Reymond (73ff.).
