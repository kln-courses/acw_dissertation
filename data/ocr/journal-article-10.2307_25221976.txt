Part I rpHE musical interlude which adorns so many a story in The Thousand NigfUs and One Night is one of the most interesting features of that " wondrous treasury of Muslim folk-lore ", as Burton dubbed the Alf laila wa laila.1 Yet, strange to say, our translators and commentators have taken little cognizance of this fact. Indeed, beyond the brief and inadequate notices contributed by Lane * to his translation of the Nights, it can safely be averred that no serious attention has been devoted to the subject. It was on this account that the present study was made. The texts used are those of Calcutta (1839-1842), Beyrout (1888-1892), and Bulaq (1893-5 = 1311-12 A.n.). Unless other wise specified, the references in the footnotes are to the Calcutta text. What follows in round brackets refers to Burton's translation (London, 1886-7). ?1 The Function of the Musi? Almost everywhere in the Nights we see music in the predicament of being linked with Wine and Woman among the malah? or for bidden pleasures against which the Muslim purists hurled anathema. Both Lane and Burton only touch the fringe of this subject, but by saying too little imply too much. Whilst Burton expresses the view that " Muhammad objected to music "8 Lane is more peremptory and states that " Music was condemned by the Prophet almost as severely as wine ".4 The truth is that we have as much evidence that Muhammad did not discountenance listening to music (al-sam?') as that he did, a point which I have emphasized more than once. 6 That is why Muslim society, both high and low, 1 Arabian Nights, Lady Burton's edition (London, 1886-7), i, p. ix.

OF TUE ARABIAN NIGHTS 173 in spite of the fulminations of the moralists, have ever appreciated music, as the Nights prove conclusively. As our verse-prelude testifies, music was put to other uses than mere concomitance to the forbidden pleasures, and we see that to the ?ufl and daruUsh music was " food " because it sustained them in their devotions. Does not the pseudo-dervish in the Nights say, "Our food is the remembrance of Allah in our hearts and the listening to singers with our ears." l Unfortunately this usage of music is but rarely averted to in the Nights, and even then merely en passant, such as the reference to the talla9 of the Sublime Qur'?n a the munshid at the dhikr,* the muyadhdhin at the minaret,4 or the nSiha at the funeral.8 Yet there are scores of Arabic treatises on music as an aid to devotion.6 The above verse also tells us that music was " medicine ", a circumstance due to the fact that the art had its place in therapeutics. It was not the mere soothing effect of music on the mind that was held to have curative power, but rather a theory in which mathematics, astronomy, and music were finked together in an elaborate system which produced cures according to certain pro portions.7 The system was actually followed in the hospitals.8 Yet to the great majority of people music was, as we shall see, as refreshing as " a fan " on a sultry day although, to the hedonistic crowd as displayed in the Nights, usually to the accompaniment of Wine and Woman. The stories and verses testify this abundantly. " Drinking without music (tarab) is not pleasant," says the Shaikh Ibrahim,9 whilst another urges that " drinking without listening to music (al-sam?*) lacks its essential joy ",10 and a third admonishes with a saying of Baghdad that " wine without listening to music results in the headache ".u The needs of the man who wished to drink in the tale of Ibrahim and J?mila further illustrates the point. Although he merely " wished to drink " he says to the porter, " Buy us fresh fruit and wine . . . and dessert and flowers, and five plump fowls, and bring me an (?d (lute)." 12 ii, 88 (ii, 463). * iv, 649 (vi, 124). ? i,591(ii, 112). ? i, 246 (i, 277). i, 244 (i, 275).

Hearken to 'Ali Nur al-D?n in the Nights chanting, " A lutanist to us inclined, and stole our wits bemused with wine." 2 Or, as another sings, " The fawn of a maid bent her lute in hand, and her music made us right mettlesome." 8 Those who may recall the delightful fantasy of Al-Fashsh?r (The Boaster) in The Barber's Tale of his Fifth Brother, where " Wine, Woman, and Song " stand out in high relief, will remember how he bragged that he would have every singer and songstress in the city perform at his bidding when Dame Fortune smiled on him.4 Yet this gratification in the witching charms of music was a costly affair in these days and small fortunes were gifted to the practitioners of the art, as we shall see. In the story of TJie Man Who Never Laughed the moral of spending to excess on music (tarab) and other delights is made plain.6 The theme is an old one and is often discanted in Arabic literature, hence the proverb, " Man listens [to music], rejoices, spends money, reflects, grieves, and dies." 6 Yet despite the reams of moralizing the Arab still says, " Better a liberal sinner than a stingy saint.'' In these diversions of the upper and middle classes, the art of music reached its apogee in Islamic lands, for it was in these surroundings that Arabian classical music was born and nurtured. Here the great vocal qas?da, qit?', and nufta were cultivated as well as the vocal and instrumental suite the nauba. Yet all that was performed was no more than what we would term chamber music. Indeed, in the early tales of the NigJits, it was generally the '?d (lute), either alone or with some accompanying pulsatile instrument, a duff (tambourine) or tabl (drum), that was used to play with a singer or to perform an instrumental divertimento. Sometimes we read of the nay (flute) being used with the '?d, or even the nay or shabbaba (fife) alone,7 although there would invariably be a duff or tabl added for the rhythm. Then we see the jank (harp) and sintir (dulcimer) complementing each other,8 and 1 i, 274 (i, 307). * iv, 264 (y, 296). * i, 309 (i, 341).

Although all this indulgence in the " forbidden pleasures " by the upper and middle classes, as displayed in the Nights, was railed at by the strict men of Islam, it mattered little, since the classes could point triumphantly to the Khalifate court as their example. The masses were no different, and even they set the fiats of the piously-minded at naught where the intriguing gaina (singing-girl) of the tavern was concerned. All and sundry were prepared to fritter away their dar?hlm (silver coins) where a pretty face and alluring song prompted, for the " wanton one ", as the Islamic purists would say, expected her clients to be liberal. Others, it would seem, made their own music when they went wine bibbing, as did the hunchback who took his duff with him.8 Then there is the other side of the picture, for music could still be "as refreshing as a fan " without being associated with Wine and Woman, and it is thus that we see it amongst the folk, the people at large, as the Nights frequently record, like the bath keeper with his drum (darbukka),* or the negro with his reed-pipe (mizm?r),* or the corn chandler and scavenger who danced as they sang.6 At all private and public festivities, vocal and instrumental music were indispensable. Guests were frequently welcomed by slaves beating their tambourines (duf?f).1 At births,8 and marriages 9 the professional songstresses (mughannly?t) could be heard singing their joyous lays to the beating of the square (duff) or round tambourine (far), the latter also serving as the collecting box for the customary tips (nuq?t),10 for it was said that " Singing without tips (nuq?t) is like a corpse without aromatics (hun?t) ".u 1 i, 67 (i, 83). a i, 372 (i, 395). 8 i, 203 (i, 230). ? i, 244 (i, 274). * i?, 179 (iii, 30). * i, 244 (i, 275). 7 i, 373 (i, 396). ? ?, 353 (i, 378). 9 i, 165 (i, 191). 10 Nuq?t ia quite a late word.

In such a work as the Nights, where the martial throng creates almost as much interest as the love theme, it is only natural that military music should find ample mention. Although generally known as the tabl kh?na, as I have explained elsewhere,8 the military band is spoken of in the NigJits as the nauba* its chief function in times of peace being the performance of certain pieces of music at particular hours (^y) of the day, hence the term nauba, as well as at official ceremonies.6 Indeed the phrase daqqat al-basha'ir, used in announcing glad tidings in the Nights and elsewhere, shows that it was the drum which was struck (daqqa) to announce these glad tidings.6 In time of war the nauba played an important part, as may be gathered from such stories as the History of GJiarib and his BrotJier 'Ajlb and the Story ofJ?nsh?h. In battle array the nauba was usually drawn up away from the actual conflict, where it played unceasingly during the strife. So long as the music lasted the army fought on, and even a division forced to retreat would often return to the fray because its nauba was still playing. Two definite calls or signals are mentioned in the Nights, viz. the " Battle " (al'Jiarb) 7 and the " Retreat " (aUnfi??l)* both being sounded on the drum (tabl), although the former is sometimes announced by the cymbals (Jc?s?t).9 We also read of the cymbals proclaiming the " March ".10 The nauba or military band described in the Nights comprises various combinations. Generally it is simply the drum, or the 1 i,680(ii, 196). * i?, 32 (ii, 413). ? Encyciopmdia of Islam, v, 217. * i, 95 (i, 114) ; iv, 528 (vi, 65). 1 i, 700 (ii, 202). iii, 617 (v, 7).

From what has preceded we can appreciate the many uses to which music was put in the Nights?as an inspiration to the dervish, as a cure for the physician, as diversion to the hedonist, as gladness to the steadfast, and as stimulation to the warrior. Yet music was something more. Although the art was developed in its highest form among the leisured classes, even midst the more proscribed mal?hi, it was here that we catch a glimpse that it was sometimes appreciated for itself alone, although such an attitude of mind was forbidden by some of the fuqali?. We also know that as a science which engaged the minds of the greatest Muslim thinkers, an Al-F?r?b? and an Ibn S?n?, it was also given recognition in the Nights, where even the qaina Tawaddud boasted of her knowledge of the theory of music (fann al-m?siql).n 1 iv, 46 (v, 84) : iii, 271 (iv, 217). ? i, 659 (ii, 84). ? i, 403 (i, 420). 4 iii. 160 (iv. 100). ? iv, 616 (vi, 95). ii, 32 (ii, 413). 7 i, 80 (i, 97). 8 ii, 96, Beyrout edit, (ii, 202). ?, 649 (iii, 426). 10 ii, 656 (iii, 430). ? ?, 669 (ii, 432). lf ii, 669 (ii, 432). ? iii. 303 (iv, 246). 14 iii, 293 (iv, 328).

The phrase often runs, as in the NigJits, " as melodious as the psalms of the House of David," 1 in which expression (maz?mlr ?l D?'?d) we have " higher criticism " before its time. Another form of compliment paid to singers was to compare their singing to " warbling " (gharid),2 or that its excellence " stayed the flight of birds ".8 According to the Qur'?n,* birds were the companions of David in singing the praises of Allah, and so, with the psalmist, the warbling of birds was considered music par excellence, and the death of birds on hearing music was taken as proof of its " killing charm ",6 The expression " kills with delight " in relation to music actually became quite a commonplace in Arabic literature.6 Death at the hearing of music is not a rarity in Arabic tales,7 and it occurs in the Nights in the story of The Three Unfortunates* which is said to have been related by Al-'UtbL8 Swooning at music is a more general casualty, and in the Nights it happens in the stories of The Lovers of Al-Medtna and The Ruined Man of Baghdad.10 It is only by taking the fullest cognizance of what has been detailed above that we can understand the extravagant language used in the Nights and elsewhere in relation to the effect of music. It is averred that one performer's music would " deaden the quick and quicken the dead " : of another's that " it made the unintelligible intelligible ". Delightful anagogues. Yet when we are told that " it made the hardest stones dance for glee ",n or that " the very room danced with excess of delight ",la it is not mere verbal imagery or metaphor that prompts the storyteller but rather anthropomorphism. The literature of Arabian music reeks with this doctrine, as' the NigJUs so often reveal, and perhaps the most I ii, 83 (ii, 485). * ii, 450 (iii, 253). 8 ii, 83 (ii, 485). 4 S?rat, xxi, 79 ; xxxiv, 10 ; xxzviii, 16. * Agh?n?, v, 52 ; Sa'd?, Qulist?n, iii, 28. 9 Agh?ni (B?l?q edit.), ix, 95. * AU*iqd aUfarid (B?l?q edit., 1887-8,), iii, 198. * ii, 439 (iii, 242). iii, 412 (iv, 344). 10 iv, 360 (v, 375).

As its name indicates, the lute C?d) itself was made of wood ((ud), and the Arabs deluded themselves into the belief that the resonance of the instrument was due to the fact that the wood had absorbed the warbling of birds that had once perched on it when it was a branch of a tree. So the poet of the Nights chants * :? " A tree whilere I was, the bulbuls' home, To whom for love I bowed my grass-green head : They moaned on me, and I their moaning learnt And in that moan my secret all men read : The woodman felled me without offence, And slender lute of me (as view ye) made ; But, when the fingers smite my strings, they tell How man despite my patience did me dead " : Or as it says elsewhere., "[The lute] moaned and resounded, and after its older home yearned ; and it remembered the waters which gave it drink and the earth whence it sprang and whence it grew." Music being part of the macrocosmic system of the Arabic scientists and philosophers, the strings of the lute were linked up with that entertaining conceit known as " the four-fold things ", of which the singing-girl chants in the tale of 'Ali N?r aVDin and Mar y am the Girdle Girl. " Seest not how four-fold things conjoin in one ? " The notion was hoary with antiquity, but in Islamic times it was developed into a comprehensive system by Al-Kind? (d. 874).2 It is merely hinted at in the Nights, but there is sufficient material in the story of Abu'l-Husn and his slave-girl Tuwaddud to enable us to draw up the conspectus on p. 180 which shows how music was irrevocably bound up with cosmic things. The classification of the constellations is inconsistent in the Nights, which is rather amusing in view of Tuwaddud's vaunted knowledge of the subject.3 Out of this conceit an ethoidal system was developed and every melodic and rhythmic mode had its particular ethos. It also governed the musico-medical practice already mentioned, but from the many contradictory tables which have come down to us the number of failures in treatment must have been high. 1 iv, 262 (v, 294). 1 Farmer, The Influence of Music, 12 : Sa*adyah Goon, 8-9. ii, 493, 523, 626 (iii, 281, 312, 316).</page><page sequence="9">180 THE MUSIC OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS Thb Fourfold Things [Strings of the Lute Bamm MaQdath Mathn?

At court they attended at specified hours known as their nauba or turn,1 and generally played behind a curtain in a special apart ment as described by Lane.2 One of these curtains mentioned in the Nights was of brocade with tassels of silk and rings of gold.8 The minstrel (mughanni) of the Nights was a highly skilled singer and instrumentalist who, like the Medieval European minstrel, was also expected to have other accomplishments, including all that was ctesired of a " boon companion" (nadtm). Most, if not all of those introduced into the Nights held positions as court minstrels, which brought them not only a regular stipend but the usual largesse which was often a small fortune in itself. The instrumentalist (mutrib, ?latl) was so named in Arabic because he performed on an " instrument of emotion " (?lat al-tarab), or " instrument of diversion " (?lat al-lahw), these particular terms being often used so as to distinguish the musician who was primarily an instrumentalist.4 He also was to be found at the courts and the 1 ii, 439 (Hit 242). I have shown in the Ency. of Islam, iii, 885, how the Arabian art form known as the nauba (suite) had its origin in this system of the court minstrels taking their " turn " at court. * i, 203. This apartment (mughanna) was still to be found in Egypt in the time of Lane (Modern Egyptians [1860], 355), but there was lattice work as a screen instead of a curtain. ? iv, 659 (vi, 47). ? ii, 654 (iii, 428).</page><page sequence="10">THE MUSIC OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS 181 palaces of the nobility, but the name was also applied to the humbler type, whether urban or strolling, who supplied outdoor music with drum (tabl) and reed-pipe (zamr) at festival time. The songstress (mughanntya) was frequently a matron or other freed-woman who had acquired her art as a singing-girl or had picked it up otherwise. She was the mainstay of private and public rejoicings, whether political or religious, when her tambourine was invariably in evidence. The singing-girl (qaina) was also a songstress, but she was a slave. Rarely is she called a qaina in the Nights,1 the more frequent terms being mughanntya or jdriya. She was usually specially trained for her profession and found her way, either by private barter or the slave market, into the families of the nobility and wealthy class, the price demanded for her being usually determined by her accomplishments and physical charms, although one recalls a saying of Sa'd? that " a sweet voice is better than a beautiful face ".* Fabulous sums were often paid for some of these singing-girls as is testified by both the Agh?ni and the Nights. They were also held in high esteem, especially those who did not come as full fledged artistes from the slave market but had been reared in the owner's household.3 It is asserted in the Nights 4 and elsewhere 6 that portraits of these girls adorned the houses of their masters, in spite of the ban of Islam. The lives of some of these professional musicians are ?&gt;f extreme interest, since they reveal the intimate part which they played in the domestic and social life of the Arabian East. For that reason a few details from their lives as recorded in the Nights have been culled for insertion here. All the male musicians mentioned in the Nights were historic characters when the stories were compiled. Y?nus al-K?tib (d. c. 765) is the subject of the story of Y?nus the Scribe and Al-Wal?d ibn Sahl6 in which he and his singing-girl, who was his pupil, sing before the Prince Al-Wal?d. Yfmus asks fifty thousand silver pieces for this girl and receives it together 1 ii, 439 (iii, 242) ; iv, 172 (v, 191). 1 Gulist?n, iii, 28. 8 ii, 402 (iii, 208). 4 iii, 142 (iv, 97). 5 S. L.

Burton writes : " Khalif Al-Wal?d," although the story distinctly states that the incident took place in tho Khalifato of Hish?m.</page><page sequence="11">182 THE MUSIC OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS with a substantial tip.1 When the Prince became Khalif in the year 743 Y?nus sang at his court at Damascus. Ab? Ish?q Ibrahim al-Mausil? (d. 804) was at the courts of Al-Had? and H?r?n, and appears in the Nights in the story of Ibrahim al-Mausil? and tJie Devil. The latter, who is called Ab? Murra (Father of Myrrh),2 visits Ibrahim and plays and sings to him so wondrously that it seemed as if " the doors and the walls and all that was in the house answered and sang with him, for the beauty of his voice ". Ibrahim went to the palace immediately and repeated the music which he had heard to Khalif H?r?n.3 In the Agh?nt, where the story is also told, the uncanny visitor is given his proper name Ibl?s.4 We read of Ibrahim elsewhere, notably as the author of the story of The Lovers of Al-Medlna,6 in the story of N?r al~D?n 'AU and the Damsel An?s al-Jal?s* and as Khalif H?r?n's emissary in the story of 'Abdallah ibn F?dil and His Brothers,7 which reveals how highly this court minstrel was esteemed. Ab? Ish?q Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi (d. 839) was the younger brother of Khalif Harun. In spite of the fact that it was not con sidered good form for a Muslim of such high standing to indulge seriously in music, Prince Ibrahim had been specially trained in the art. We read of his adventures in the story of IbraJ?m ibn al-MaJidl and tlie Merchant's Sister where, lute in hand, he demon strates how faultily a singing-girl performs a particular mode (tariqa).9 The story of his arrest and pardon for his attempt to seize the Khalifate is contained in Ibrahim ibn al-MaJidl and tJie Barber Surgeon.9 Here, however, Ibrahim al-Mausil? is wrongly credited with the arrest of the Prince in 825-6, since the great minstrel had been dead for twenty years.10 Ish?q ibn Ibrahim al-Mausil? (d. 850) was the greatest musician that the Golden Age produced, and even the Nights aver that " he was excelling in this art ".11 He is featured in the story of IsJi?q al-Mausil? which tells us of an escapade with Khad?ja, a singing-girl 1 iii, 379 (iv, 315). I The author of the T?j aVar?s tells us with aU seriousness that this name given to the Devil, was due to the fact that his daughter's name was Murra. ? iii, 388 (iv, 321). ? v, 36.

They are ?adaqa ibn ?adaqa and Zurz?r al-Sagh?r. The former is named in the story of Abu'l Hasan of Khurasan where Sadaqa is said to have been with Khalif Al-Mutawakkil and his waz?r Al-Fath ibn Kh?q?n when the former was murdered in 861.8 His name does not occur in the Agh?n? or similar books, but he was probably a grandson of Abu ?adaqa M?8k?i, a minstrel at the court of Harun, and brother of Ahmad ibn ?adaqa who was a minstrel favoured by Al-Mutawakkil.8 Zurz?r al-?agh?r is also not registered in the Agh?n?, but since there is a Zurz?r al-Kab?r mentioned at the court of Khalif Al-Mu'tasim (d. 843)10 there is some justification for accepting the historicity of Zurz?r Minor, who is only recognized in the Nights as the composer of a melody.11 The female musicians in the Nights, with one exception, are not credited in history. Yet there is no reason why they should not be mentioned here, especially as they furnish a fair picture of the varied accomplishments of these artistes and what was expected of them in these days. Indeed, it enables one to appreciate how the epithet '?lima (pi. 'awalim), i.e. " learned female ", came to be given to the singing-girl as in modern Egypt.12 Here are the more outstanding of these female musicians of the Nights.

She was carefully educated, " read (qar?*) the Qur'?n and the sciences, knew all kinds of games (lu'ab) and devices (?l?t), and surpassed in singing (maghn?), and in instruments of music (malah?)." Eventually she was espoused to Ni'mat Allah. Yet her exquisite beauty and inimitable talents led Al-Hajj?j, the crafty Governor of 'Iraq 'Arab?, to secure her by guile for Khalif 'Abd al-Malik (d. 705). Fortunately for her husband there is a happy ending.1 Al-Badr al-Kab?r (The Incomparable Full Moon) was another rearling, but, in this case, had been brought up in the palace of Ja'far the son of Khalif M?s? al-H?d? (d. 786). She was " perfect in beauty " and there was not in her time anyone " more accom plished in the art of singing (ghinff) and the playing of [instruments of] strings (awt?r "). Being enamoured of her, Muhammad al-Am?n (d. 813), who later became Khalif, abducted her under the very nose of Ja'far, who forgave his erring kinsman and sacrificed his beautiful qaina, accepting a boatload of gold, silver, and jewels as a solatium.2 fi Q?t al-Qul?b (Sustenance of Hearts), on the contrary, was acquired in the slave-market by a certain Ibn al-Qirn?s for five thousand gold pieces, although he sold her to Khalif H?r?n for twice that sum. She knew " all the'arts and sciences, could string poetry, and play upon all kinds of instruments of music (tarab) ".8 An?s al-Jal?s (Companionable Companion) was a singing-girl who cost a notional King of Al-Basra ten thousand gold pieces. She was probably worth every penny of it since we are assured that she was acquainted with " calligraphy, syntax, and lexico graphy, exegesis [of the Qur'?n], principles of jurisprudence and religion, [canons of] medicine, [computation of] the calendar, and playing instruments of music (?l?t aUmutriba) ". Above all, she was the possessor of " dewy lips sweeter than syrup ".4 Tawaddud (Showing Affection), the last to be mentioned, out shone all others in her accomplishments, if we are to believe the Nights. She was the singing-girl of Abu'1-Husn of Baghdad and her prodigious talents and marvellous erudition flabbergasted Khalif H?r?n. She claimed that she was versed in syntax, poetry, juris 1 ii, 38 (ii, 419). ? ii, 402 (iii, 208). iv, 163 (v, 183). * ii, 489 (iii, 277).</page><page sequence="14">THE MUSIC OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS 185 prudence, exegesis [of the Qur*?n], lexicography, theory of music,1 law of inheritance, arithmetic, division, geodesy, fables of the ancients, the Sublime Qur'?n, the Holy Traditions, arts of govern ment,2 geometry, philosophy, alchemy,8 logic, and rhetoric. She could also " play on the '?d (lute), and knew the construction of the melodic modes (maw?di* al-nagham) on it, and the rhythms (maw?qV) of the beatings of its strings, and their caesura (sakan?t) ", as well as being proficient in singing and dancing.4 Mahb?ba (Beloved), the one historical character among the songstresses and singing-girls of the Nights, belonged to Al-Basra. According to this source she was gifted to Khalif Al-Mutawakkil (d. 861) by 'Ubaidall?h [ibn 'Abdallah] ibn T?hir (d. c. 912), himself a first-rate musician.6 It is more probable that it was 'Abdallah ibn T?hir (d. 844) who made the present, as the Agh?n? states.6 In the Nights we are told that she was of " surpassing beauty and loveliness . . . played well upon the lute and was skilled in singing and making verses and wrote a beautiful hand ",7 an appraisement which is confirmed by the Agh?n?.6 1 ii, 493 (iii, 281).
