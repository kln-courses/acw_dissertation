System der theoretischen, pralctischen und religiosen Fi7ktionen der Menschheit auf Grund eines idealistischen Positivismus. Mit einem Anhang iuber Kant und Nietzsche. H. VAIHINGER. Berlin: Verlag von Reuther &amp; Reichard. 1911. Pp. xxxv + 804. This important book, written more than thirty years ago, but not pub- lished until last year, when the author suddenly realized the kinship between his radical views and other revolutionary tendencies in recent philosophy, such as neo-Fichtean voluntarism, radical empiricism, prag- matism, Bergsonianism,-might well claim to be called, as its full title indicates, a critique of human reason. One may agree or not with Pro- fessor Vaihinger, but there is little possibility of misunderstanding a philosophy whose presuppositions are so clearly formulated. They may be summarized as follows: (1) All the reality that we are justified in as- suming are sensations and their complexes (empiricism); (2) thought and being are not identical,-the former is but an organic function and has merely instrumental value (pragmatism); (3) thought, serving only as a means to the individual for the better orientation in the sensational flux, general terms must be regarded as having no other than a practical value (nominalism and anti-intellectualism). From these points of view Vaihinger develops the theory that all concepts, laws, and theories are merely fictions. Fictions, in Vaihinger's usage, are not identical with figments, such as centaur or fairy, nor are they hypotheses capable of verification. They are deliberate devices (Kunstgriffe) on the part of thought for the practical purpose of successful orientation in and perfect control over the environment. Theoretically they are absolutely valueless. Applied with a knowledge of their fictitious character, they will lead to the intended practical results, but used as hypotheses, they must neces- sarily create confusion and false theories, for a fiction is defined as that which is both contradictory in itself and which has no correspondence with reality (sensational flux). To illustrate the nature of fictions, Professor Vaihinger has collected examples from various fields of thought. Many illustrations taken from mathematics will be regarded by modern investigators as antiquated, but those borrowed from other realms are certainly impressive. Dichotomous artificial divisions of nature (organic and inorganic, animate and inani- mate, etc.); the Linnaean or other classifications of plants; over-simplifi-</page><page sequence="2">718 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY cation, excessive abstraction, and over complication of the real world by all sciences; analogies in mathematics, economics, theology, and other fields; hypostatic, anthropomorphic, and animistic scientific concepts; ethical postulates, logical principles, and epistemological categories-all these are fictions in Vaihinger's sense, all these are deliberately artificial, mental constructs to which nothing corresponds in reality (sensational flux) and whose sole justification lies in their practical usefulness. The epistemological lesson which Professor Vaihinger wishes us to draw from his " Fiction-Theory " is this: Knowledge of the real world by means of categories is impossible, since all categories are fictions, and dis- cursive thinking consists in the application of fictitious static concepts to the real flux of sensations. The world such as we "know" it is an interpretation, but an interpretation by means of fictions. But although a "theory" of the universe is impossible, for the sake of useful and suc- cessful action certain fictions must be regarded as if they were more true than otllers. Truth is nothing but error constantly and progressively reg- ulated. Thought with its complex of fictions may be compared to the mechanism of a machine. The ideal is to do the greatest possible amount of work with the least possible amount of effort. What screws, levers, pulleys, planes, and the like are to mechanics, fictions are to thought. As rational beings we must always operate with them, but our rationality consists in the recognition of their fictitiousness. And this, according to Vaihinger, is the tragedy of life-to live and to act as if fiction were theo- retically true. The task of logic is, according to this philosophy, very definite: the study of the relative usefulness of fictions. The business of a complete methodology is to bring order into the shifting fictions which humanity has invented in its struggle with the sensational flux, to classify them, to define their extent and limits, to assign relative values to them. But the logician should always remember that logic is not Selbstzweck; beyond their practical value all logical theories and systems as such are equally nil. This is " Critical Positivism," as Vaihinger calls his " theory," which he interestingly relates to Kant and to Nietzsche. The obvious critical comment to be made upon this philosophy is that its presuppositions-unless they are thrust upon us dogmatically-de- mand a theoretical standard for their justification. The equation of real- ity with the sensational flux, the denial of theoretical interests for their own sake, the ascription of merely instrumental value to thinking and ultimate, or at least prepotent, value to acting-all these are theoretical assumptions which presuppose a meta-practical point of view for their acceptance or rejection. Besides, one may agree with the spirit of Vaihinger's " Fiction-Theory " without being forced into an admission of either his presuppositions or conclusions. That every science, because it offers a mere fragmentary view of reality, is dealing with fictions; that every science must for the sake of its practical interests regard its fictions as if they were true; that scientific truth may be looked upon as error con- stantly regulated,-are theses equally, indeed more, compatible with ideal- istic presuppositions and conclusions. But Vaihinger's book, though both</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 719 its fundamental assumptions and final theses may be rejected, is a philo- sophic work whose importance it is impossible to exaggerate. As a criti- cism of science it is an extremely significant contribution to the field of methodology and as an exposition of pragmatism,-though the author repudiates the title and scornfully identifies American pragmatism with mere utilitarianism,-it is the only coherent and systematic expression of this "new name for some old ways of thinking."
