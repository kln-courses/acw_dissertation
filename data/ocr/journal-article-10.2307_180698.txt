South of the Sahara a broad belt of savanna grassland stretches from east to west, from the Ethiopian highlands to the Atlantic Ocean; the lake almost straddles that belt. To the north of the lake lies the desert and to its south a go-mile-wide corridor beyond which rises the abrupt northern end of the Cameroon Mountains that extend south-westwards to the Gulf of Guinea. The importance of the lake's position has been demonstrated in recent times when British, French and German imperial interests came face to face on its shores. Since the advent of African independence those shores are even more divided: between the Republics of Nigeria, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon. The lake is a cross-roads in the heart of Africa; trans-Saharan routes from the north, savanna routes from east and west, Chari-Logone routes reaching deep into Equatoria.1 A great deal has been written about the past of the Lake Chad region: in particular, quaternary geologists have investigated the shrinkage of the lake with the increasing desiccation of the Sahara and historians have studied the rise and duration of the kingdom of Bornu. Between these two extremes, however, there has been sandwiched a substantial period illuminated only faintly by oral tradition and linguistics. By the early I960s J.-P. Lebeuf2 and others had clearly demonstrated the existence of important prehistoric archaeological remains in the Lake region but, in the words of Thurstan Shaw, 'a satisfactory sequence stratigraphically established had failed to emerge'.3 An archaeological reconnaissance made in I959 by A. D. H. Bivar and P. L. Shinnie had contributed extensively 1 The first European explorers to reach Bornu, Denham, Clapperton and Oudney, did so in I823, via the Tripoli-Lake Chad route. They named the lake Lake Waterloo but the local name is the one by which it has become known. (Denham in C. Howard (ed.), West African explorers (Oxford, I95I) 2I7.) 2 M. Griaule and J.-P.

By April I965 it had become apparent that the Yobe mounds were middens rather than settlement mounds, that is to say that they resulted from the systematic dumping of refuse from adjacent settlements rather than from the accretion of structural remains from settlements themselves. Furthermore, the sites so far examined were all of Iron Age date for they yielded no evidence of stone-using societies. Attention was switched, therefore, to the great clay plains known as the 'firki' which lie to the south of Lake Chad, occupying the corridor between the lake and the mountains.8 By June I965, test excavation at Kursakata, and extensive surface work in this area, had demonstrated the existence of many settle- ment mounds. These constituted 'tells' whose great height indicated very lengthy occupation which surface finds suggested might have been inaug- urated by late Stone Age peoples.9 Following the I965 wet season, work resumed in October, and in December test excavations were commenced in a mound near the village of Daima, close to the Cameroon border.'0 This mound was the highest known in the region and the test work so clearly demonstrated its importance that from January to May I966 the excavation of a major section was undertaken. Further field-work in February and March i967 revealed more mounds on the firki and during this period some of the mounds in Cameroon and Chad were also examined. Finally, during February I969, more surface work was carried out on the firki and test excavations were conducted at Bornu 38 and at Shilma (Bornu 70). Although several interim statements concerning this work have already been published, an overall review of the results of the project is now 6 Unpublished report for the Nigerian Federal Department of Antiquities. I Directed by Professor H. F. C. Smith, Department of History, Ahmadu Bello University, this scheme was jointly financed by Ahmadu Bello University and by the University of Ibadan, in the latter case from funds provided by the Rockefeller Foundation through the Institute of African Studies of the University of Ibadan. 8 'Firki' is a local word used to describe what is technically montmorillonitic clay. When wet it is black and very greasy; when dry it is grey, extremely hard, and subject to regular deep cracking. It is sometimes (incorrectly) called 'black cotton soil'. 9 The term 'tell' is derived from an Arabic word meaning a hillock (Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford, I944). It has become accepted as a specific archaeological term to designate a site where a mound has grown up composed of the remains of succes- sive settlements. The formation of 'tells' has been frequently described. See for example S. Lloyd, Mounds of the Near East (Edinburgh, I963), Chapter i. 10 Alhaji Abba Mohammed Habib, Waziri of Dikwa, first drew the writer's attention to this site. Both he and the Shehu of Dikwa aided the research project in many ways.</page><page sequence="5">THE DAIMA SEQUENCE 325 needed." The chronological evidence is the most important aspect of these results and it is this which will be discussed in this paper. A major stratified sequence at Daima, test excavations in six other sites and surface examination of 70 sites together with a total of 2o radiocarbon dates for six of the excavated sites (Fig. 2) give an opportunity to suggest a prelimin- ary archaeological sequence for the region. Earliest settlement There is as yet no clear evidence of the settlement of this area before the end of the second millennium B.C. An early second millennium radiocarbon date for Bornu 38 (Fig. 2) may well have been affected by older charcoal washed into the probably deltaic sands on which the mound is located. Charcoal was observed in the natural sands beneath the mound, and the dated sample, taken from the base of the archaeological deposits, may have been contaminated by this older material. Such charcoal could have originated from a considerable distance but may indicate the presence in the area of earlier settlement for which we have as yet no associated sites. It has been suggested that the increasing desiccation of the Sahara after the middle of the third millennium B.C. forced groups of people to move into the surrounding areas.12 It was presumably such groups who first 11Publications by the present writer concerning the Lake Chad region of Nigeria include the following: D.

The failure to find sites of earlier date would suggest that these regions were not available for settlement prior to some time in the second millennium B.C. because they were covered by the waters of a much larger lake.13 As the Sahara became drier so the lake shrank. All the archaeological sites in this area for which radiocarbon dates have been obtained lie on the lake side of the Bama Ridge, a sand ridge thought to have formed at the edge of a lagoon fringing the larger lake of the major pluvial attributed by the Servants to the period 7000/8000 to 2500 B.C.14 It was during this period that the dark clay deposits now known as the firki were formed on the lake floor.15 South-west of the Bama Ridge, and running parallel with it, lies a con- temporary shore line which has not yet been investigated archaeologically.16 It is along this shore line that sites dating from before the second millen- nium B.C. might be found. It is possible that the stoneless character of most of the country fringing the present lake might have been a deterrent to early settlement by stone-using peoples, even if the area was not all under water, but such a problem could be solved by the adoption of bone as a raw material as was done by the earliest inhabitants of Daima. Bearing in mind these two problems of availability of dry land and of stone for artefacts, the most likely place for sites earlier than those found so far might be the northern end of the Mandara Mountains where the shore line behind the Bama Ridge may have been formed by the foothills themselves which at this point rise precipitously out of the old lake sediments.17 Indeed, R. C. Soper has found 'a surface scatter of flakes and cores on an eroded area of sandy wash near the foot of the mountains' at Pulke. He calls this material 'Middle Stone Age' and from the context in which it is mentioned it seems to be of quartz."8 A stratified series of radiocarbon dates for a rock shelter movement, writing of 'after 2000 B.C.' and, following Lhote's dating of the Egyptian influences in the later 'bovidian' style paintings in Tasili and his date for the final dis- appearance of the Neolithic there, Clark goes on to say: 'Thus, from the close of the second millennium B.C. it may be expected that Saharan influences on the savanna and forest cultures of western Africa must have been considerably increased'. 13 Very much earlier evidence may exist buried deep in the silts of the Chad Basin. 14 E.

Excavation at Bornu 38 The site of Bornu 38 is a settlement mound a little under 3 metres high consisting of roughly horizontally stratified sand and gravel.19 It is situated approximately 21 kilometres north-west of the town of Bama and is bisected by the modern Bama-Maiduguri road. Located at II0 32'N., I3? 40' E. it lies just off the Bama Ridge, probably on old deltaic deposits of the River Yedseram formed at a time when that river emptied into the larger lake contemporary with the Ridge. These deposits lay over the edge of the firki, and parts of them must have been above water and available for settlement at an earlier date. The mound contained pottery, much of which was plain but some of which was decorated with toothed stamp or incisions. There was animal bone and a little freshwater shell. Fragments of ground stone axes, several hammerstones which looked as if they had previously been ground stone axes, a small number of bone tools of simple type amongst which the only type commonly paralleled at Daima was the plain bone point, a very few quartz flakes and many broken grindstones and stone grinders were also found. There were no bone harpoons and no iron. No structures were found but there was a small quantity of human skeletal material including an inhumation burial with tooth evulsion of the two lower first incisors. There was a notable lack of the clay figurines so characteristic of the Daima sequence. Continued settlement and material culture might suggest that the occupants of this site were food producers but there is no direct evidence that this was so. The radiocarbon dates are for the lower deposits and indicate that the earlier settlement belonged to the end of the second millennium and the first half of the first millennium B.C. but occupation probably continued until late in the first millen- nium. Excavation at Kursakata (Bornu 24) The settlement mound of Kursakata started to form around the beginning of the first millennium B.C. Situated about 32 kilometres to the west- north-west of Daima, it lies at I2? I9' N., I4? I4' E. in the firki area. The 5.87 metres of deposit consisted largely of horizontally banded material. Only one small fragment of iron was found, at a depth between 2.74 and 3.I2 metres but there was very little evidence of bone tools and none at all of ground stone axes. However, in the lower levels of this mound were found a few clay animal figurines comparable with some of the earlier ones 19 This site was first reported by R. C. Soper in I964 in unpublished records belonging to the Nigerian Federal Department of Antiquities.</page><page sequence="9">THE DAIMA SEQUENCE 329 at Daima and there was also some resemblance amongst the pottery to the earlier pottery at Daima. Kursakata might span the same transition as Daima but its lesser height suggests that it was occupied for less time. The more typical features of the later Daima assemblage seem to be absent from Kursakata, though they are abundant in surface material at the settlement mound on which stands the present town of Ngala, only about 3 kilo- metres to the north. This suggests that Kursakata was abandoned at an earlier date than Daima. Some ten individuals were represented by inhuma- tion burials in the lower part of the mound and significantly only one of these was accompanied by any grave goods (8 clay beads). At Daima the earlier burials were almost always without grave goods although the later burials were usually so accompanied (Fig. iO). The solitary radiocarbon date for charcoal from the bottom of the Kursakata mound would indicate a date of initial settlement significantly earlier than that at Daima. The date provides the earliest evidence for the occupation of the firki. Beneath the Kursakata mound the natural deposit was black firki clay, but the topography of the immediate surroundings of the mound suggests that the mound had accumulated on the edge of a sandy island rising out of the firki. The growth of tells in the firki seems to have been a response to the seasonal inundation of this area. The relatively fertile soil would have been attractive to early food producers, but there were only a limited num- ber of sites suitable for occupation during the wet season. This resulted in settlement of the same spot for long periods, in some cases up to the present day (Plate I).20 The firki area as a whole is broken by low- lying sandy areas running roughly from north-east to south-west which were formerly islands in the larger Lake Chad and before that were sief dunes. These dunes seem to have been part of the great fossil erg which extends across northern Nigeria and which attests to an earlier dry period.21 Such 'islands' would have been very attractive to 20 During this research programme surface examination was conducted at 38 settlement mounds, of which 34 were in Nigeria, two in the Cameroon Republic and two in Chad. 20 of these mounds had settlements located on them, ranging in size from small villages to fair sized towns. i6 settlement mounds were unoccupied, although some of these (like Daima) had a village situated close by. Two mounds had remains of settlements abandoned in recent years. At present the area supports large numbers of cattle, sheep and goats and yields a double harvest of guinea corn each year: the tall guinea corn (dawa) harvested in November and the dwarf guinea corn (masakwa) which grows on the retained moisture in the soil and is harvested in January almost four months after the last rains. The retention of moisture in the soil is aided by digging low dykes to prevent loss of water by run-off during the actual rains. As a result in good years there is a grain surplus that is traded to other parts of Northern Nigeria. J. D. Clark has suggested that the socio-economic pattern of early agriculture in the firki region may not have been too different from that of the Nuer of the Upper Nile (J. D. Clark, 'Mobility and settlement patterns in sub-Saharan Africa: a comparison of late prehistoric hunter gatherers and early agricultural occupation units' in P. J. Ucko, R. Tringham and G. W. Dimbleby (eds.), Man, settlement and urbanism (London, I972), I35). 21 R. A. Pullan, 'Geomorphology and pedological investigations in the south-central part of the Chad Basin, Nigeria', Palaeoecology of Africa, iv (I969), 49-52.</page><page sequence="10">330 GRAHAM CONNAH early settlers and a number of the settlement mounds in the firki region are in fact closely associated with sandy areas. At Daima the natural deposit immediately beneath the mound is firki clay, but it was found to be only a thin deposit overlying sand and it was this sand that characterized the immediate surroundings of the site. The wet season still makes Daima into an 'island' for a few months each year so that even four-wheel drive vehicles can reach the site only from December to May. But it would be misleading to suggest that the earliest settlers of the firki were simply island-dwellers, for at Shilma and other sites there was early settlement out on the firki itself and not associated with any sandy 'island'. Excavation at Shilma (Bornu 70) Shilma, near Jarawa and situated at 'I1 55' N., I40 21' E., some 37 kilometres south-south-west of Daima, is a flat settlement site made up of the remains of a very low mound which has almost totally weathered away. As a result a vast surface scatter of sherds and other archaeological material covers an area perhaps o.8 x 0.4 of a kilometre in extent. Erosion has also uncovered a number of inhumation burials, and the possible remains of mud floors and of collapsed mud walls. Test excavation through mud features of this sort revealed deposits a little under i metre at their thickest, consisting of horizontal bands of firki clay which were absolutely iron-hard. They probably represented the remains of floors, or at least of living surfaces, and could be lifted off one another with a trowel. They merged into the top of the natural firki. The cultural material from Shilma compared closely with that from the base of the Daima mound. Fragments of bone points and one fragment of a harpoon were recovered, also grindstone material and pottery similar to that at the bottom of Daima. Although no ground stone axes or frag- ments of them were excavated, some were found on the surface of the site as also were clay animal figurines and fragments of bone tools including many bone points and a number of fragments of harpoons. In I967 a hollow- based quartz point was found on the surface of this site. Only one other site in this region has produced an analogous find: in i969 half of a broken quartz point of similar type was found on the surface at Kambile (Bornu 56). This site is similar to Shilma, although smaller in extent, and is situated some 8 kilometres from it. There seems to have been little Iron Age occupation at Shilma so that one has, in effect, the base of the Daima deposits without a io metre high mound on top of them. This would allow the site to be explored in breadth by large-scale area excavation, making it possible to study the settlement plan and perhaps the contained house-plans. This very lack of later settle- ment raises the question as to why an apparently attractive site virtually ceased to be occupied at such an early date. The recent work of the</page><page sequence="11">THE DAIMA SEQUENCE 331 Servants suggests an answer.22 After a dry phase from 2500-I500 B.C. conditions in the area began to become wetter. Although this dating does not agree with the archaeological evidence, it nevertheless hints that some such climatic fluctuation might have caused the abandonment of the open firki sites like Shilma because they were no longer habitable during the wet season.23 Variations in climate and in lake level were probably ex- tremely complex in the past and even the twentieth century has seen an example of how readily they can affect settlement movement. Early in the present century there were a number of years of very low lake levels, so that in I908 the Mission Tilho recorded villages on the northern parts of the bed of Lake Chad, in places which have since been under water.24 The two radiocarbon dates for charcoal samples from Shilma indicate that the settlement belonged to the first half of the first millennium B.C. and was comparable in date to the earliest settlement at Daima, especially when it is remembered that the earliest radiocarbon date for Daima is for charcoal from near, but not quite at, the bottom of the deposits. Excavation at Daima (Bornu 29) The Daima sequence (Daima is located at I20 I24' N., I4?30'E.)isthe key to the whole prehistoric chronology of the Lake Chad region of Nigeria. Seven test cuttings and one major section have been dug into this mound. The major section, Cutting VIII, measured 50 x 6 metres, reached a greatest depth of Ii.5 metres and sectioned io065 metres of stratified archaeological deposit (Plate II and Fig. 3). A total of very approximately i 5oo cubic metres of deposit was removed from this cutting in 56 arbitrary spits each 20 centimetres deep (Fig. 4). Removal was by headpans and therefore the outer (eastern) end of the cutting was developed into a series of high steps to facilitate this process. Extensive ancient disturbances rendered the outer end of little value for stratigraphic purposes and it has been excluded from the basic data on which the Daima sequence is founded; the test cuttings I-VII have also been excluded. This basic data is drawn almost exclusively from what is called the 'main stratigraphy' of Cutting VIII, the only exception being the sample material for radiocarbon date I-3I8I which came from Cutting I and has been carefully related to the adjacent Cutting VIII stratigraphy. The eight radiocarbon dates for Daima (Fig. 2) suggest an occupation of some 1700 years duration. Erosion since abandonment has definitely removed some of the latest deposits and it is possible that the Daima sequence extended at one time to about two millennia. Does this represent continuous occupation? There is no evidence that it does not, although settlement may well have been seasonal or periodic and perhaps from time 22 Review of work of Servants by E.

The three samples concerned were of bone, however, and Tamers and Pearson have pointed out that there is an apparent tendency for bone samples to give 'late' dates.27 Perhaps it is best to keep an open mind about the date of the earliest iron at this site till more work has been done on related sites. The problem is that Daima is still the only site in Nigeria that clearly spans the transition from a stone- and bone-using technology to one using iron. This change seems to have occurred at about the same time as a marked increase in the deposition-rate of the mound as shown by plotting the radiocarbon dates against stratigraphy.28 The excavated evidence suggests that this may have been associated with a change from construction in wood and similar materials to building in mud. A 'preliminary sequence'29 and a 'revised preliminary sequence'30 for Daima have already been published. It is now possible to produce a final version of the sequence (Figs. 5-Io) except for the pottery which has still not been adequately analysed. The histograms provide an interesting picture of changing material cul- ture over a substantial period of time. The use of bone as a raw material for tools and weapons (Plate III) was largely confined to the earlier part of the mound's history and died out at the appearance of iron (Fig. 6). All the stone used at the site had to be brought in from outside the region3' but it remained an important raw material throughout the life-span of the mound, particularly for making grinder/pounders and grindstones (Fig. 5). The very great increase in the number of these towards the top of the mound 25 Graham Connah, 'Radiocarbon dates for Benin City and further dates for Daima, N. E. Nigeria', _'. Hist. Soc.

The maximum use seems to have been got from every piece of stone and many items show signs of having been used for several different purposes before they were finally discarded. The purpose of the stone balls is uncertain; some may have been merely grinder/pounders but some may have been intended as missiles. The 'grooved stones', sometimes called 'bead polishers'32 and in this case previously suggested as related to the manufacture of bone tools and projectile heads,33 are now seen to be scattered fairly evenly throughout the stratigraphy and it may be that they were used for something completely different-for arrowshaft straightening for instance, as described by Cosner.34 There is no smaller lithic industry at Daima, the 'flakes and other fragments of stone' (Fig. 5) are of coarse-grained material like the stone items already mentioned and would appear to have been an accidental by-product of their manufacture and breakage. The only anomalous stone artefacts, in this assemblage of grinding and pounding tools, were the ground stone axes which probably belonged to the lower part of the mound, as those examples from the Iron Age deposits were all fragmentary. A substantial part of the stone assemblage at Daima appears to have been intended for the grinding of plant foods, either wild or cultivated. Such evidence is notoriously ambiguous but the great increase of this grinding equipment during the later history of the mound may be con- nected with the appearance of direct evidence for cultivated sorghum (Fig. 9).35 It is interesting that the quantity of unworked animal bone diminished from the bottom to the top of the mound (Fig. 6). It is not yet Plate VII. Composite air photograph of the site of the city of Birnin Gazargamo. North is at the top of the photograph. The city wall can be clearly seen. The site of the palace lies at the centre of the city and the sites of other important buildings are scattered over the city area. The mottled appearance of much of the rest of the interior of the city probably indicates the sites of large numbers of smaller dwellings. The archaeological details are partly obscured by modern cultivation and outside the city the NE-SW vegetated dune system can be discerned. A modern village lies to the east of the city. The vertical line at the centre of the photograph results from the junction of two Nigerian Government survey photographs (reference numbers unknown but probably dating from sometime in the 1950s) which were re-photographed by Doig Simmonds to improve the contrast.

Pennisetum was also identified, but only from Spit 2 of the AH XVII</page><page sequence="22">338 GRAHAM CONNAH clear whether varying soil chemistry may have affected this situation, and certainly the condition of the bones comprising human burials was very poor in the upper parts of the mound compared with the lower parts. However, many of the larger mammalian bones have a better resistance to decay than human material and it is remarkable that so few were recovered from the upper parts of the mound. It may be that a predominantly pastoral economy had given way to a predominantly cereal-cultivating one. B. M. Fagan36 has made a detailed examination of the mammalian remains from Daima and finds that domestic cattle were the dominant species throughout the history of the mound but that 'small stock' (possibly goats) and game were more numerous in the upper part of the mound than in the lower parts. A further aspect of the cultural assemblage is relevant here: clay figurines were made throughout the occupation of the site (Fig. 7) but there seems to have been a change in emphasis from cows in the lower part of the mound to sheep or goats, human beings, and mis- cellaneous animals, some of them wild, in the upper parts of the mound. The use of fired clay for a variety of objects is a strong feature of the Daima sequence which was especially marked in the later periods of the mound's history (Figs. 7 and 8). In addition to the figurines, clay was used to make balls, beads, ear/nose/lip ornaments, bracelets, head-rests, miniature toy-like pots, and rods and sausage-shaped objects both of unknown function. Two other items of clay merit particular attention: spindle whorls which were characteristic of the later occupation and frag- ments of socket-stem smoking pipes which appeared only in the uppermost spits. The writer at first thought the latter indicated a terminal date in the seventeenth or even eighteenth century A.D.37 but the radiocarbon date I-3I8I for Spits 3 and 4 (Fig. 2) made him revise this view and recollect the heavy erosion to which mounds in this area have been subjected. It has since been suggested that the general abandonment of the site must have been within a relatively few centuries after the eleventh and that very much later elements like the smoking pipe fragments and one probably Moslem burial represent sporadic temporary reoccupation at various times.38 Amongst the possible fragments of smoking pipes at Daima are two pieces with a far deeper stratigraphic location, however. It is possible that these are stem fragments of one-piece pipes, a complete example of one such having been found on the surface of Bornu I2, one of the Yobe main stratigraphy of Cutting VIII. J. R. Harlan of the Department of Agronomy, Univ- ersity of Illinois, also examined a sample of the carbonized sorghum and reported in a letter to Thurstan Shaw dated May 1 971 that it was 'clearly a caudatum race very much as they grow in the region today'. 36 Department of Anthropology, University of California, Santa Barbara.

Evidence for iron at Daima consists both of objects of the metal and of slag; iron working was evidently carried out at the site itself, although metallurgical examination of the slag has not yet been attempted and it is uncertain whether actual smelting or merely smithing was involved (Fig. 9). 'Bronze'42 appeared rather later than iron. Most of the evidence for 'bronze' is in the form of grave goods (Fig. io) and it is unknown from what spit level most of the Daima graves were dug, although a grave fill of i*o metre depth was observed in one instance. Many of the items were made by smithing but a small number were lost-wax castings. Analysis of the 'bronzes' has shown that the majority are in fact brasses.43 The presence of 'bronze' raises interesting problems regarding the source of raw materials. Iron ore could have been obtained reasonably close at hand44 but copper- base alloys imply rather wider connexions. Other evidence also suggests that the later occupants at Daima had widespread trading connexions: glass, carnelian and quartz beads, stone lip plugs and cowry shells all make their appearance during this later occupation, particularly in the form of grave goods (Figs. 9 and io). Seventy burials were excavated from the Daima mound, fifty-three of which were situated in the 'main stratigraphy' of Cutting VIII (Fig. Io). Those in the lower part of the mound were usually without grave goods; those in the upper part most commonly had grave goods. All the burials were inhumations: contracted burial being more common in the lower part of the mound but tending to give way to flexed burial in the later part.45 Examination of the human skeletal material is still in progress46 but the 3' Comparison of internal features of the stem-bore by X-ray, conducted by S. P. Bohrer, Department of Radiology, University of Ibadan, showed that there were some differences between the Daima fragments and the Yobe specimen. 40 F. R.

The quantity of pottery could be measured in tons. Although no numerical treatment has yet been attempted, an admittedly subjective examination was made and an arbitrary selection of ii8 pots or parts of pots was drawn and described.48 Some remarks are possible and a selection of 9 pots have been illustrated (Fig. ii). There were some distinctive changes in the pottery during the mound's history. Although round-based pots were found throughout, flat-based pots were a feature of the later part of the mound. Similarly a tripod-pot was a late form. There appeared to be changes in fabric also: if a simple division is made into 'fine' and 'coarse' fabrics, then fine fabrics predomin- ated in the lower part of the mound but coarse ones in the upper part. Some of the most interesting differences were in decoration. Toothed stamping and 'walking comb'49 were distinctive decorations in the lower part of the mound but were absent from the later part. In contrast, carved rouletting and twisted cord impressions were distinctively late and absent during the earlier period. String rouletting occurred throughout the mound but a coarse variety was more common in the lower part of the mound and a fine variety in the upper part of the mound. Two rare decorations are also of interest: 'nodular' rouletting which was found only at the top of the mound but was common in the Yobe midden sites, and basketry rouletting which occurred at Daima in the early deposits only. Throughout the Daima deposits a large proportion of the pottery had a burnished slip on the outside which often extended onto the inner surface as well. There seemed to be a tendency for this burnished slip to be more common in the lower part of the mound. In general there seemed to be more large pots in the upper part of the mound than in the lower; in particular the enormous thick-walled storage pots known in local tradition as 'So pots' were present only in the upper deposits. The overall impression given by the pottery is one of two distinct traditions with an interface somewhere in Spits 2I-30, very likely in Spit 23 where an abrupt stratigraphic change was observed during excavation although this does not show very satisfactorily in the drawn section (Fig. 3). Four items in the Daima sequence are of particular significance. First, the bone harpoons (Plate III) the Saharan analogues of which have been thought to be much earlier than those at Daima.50 Willett has recently reported a radiocarbon date for vertebrate bone associated with bone harpoons from the surface of a single period site at Kobadi (I 5 22' N., 5? 29' W.) which is 7V3 ? I45 b.c. (Dak-56) and has referred also to shell 47 In July I97I. 48 The pottery drawings were done by Mrs J. A.

I97+II3 (Dak-6) but in neither of these cases does there appear to be a clear association of the harpoons and the samples that were dated.51 More radiocarbon dates for bone harpoons in the Sahara are clearly needed, but in the meanwhile one might speculate that they continued to be made until such time as iron was widely available. Indeed the general similarity to the bone harpoons from Daima of those from Ishango on the Zaire shore of Lake Edward, dated to the seventh millen- nium B.C.,52 suggests a wide distribution in space and time for such items. The second category of find at Daima meriting close attention is the clay figurines of animals and of humans. The site of Jebel Moya situated in the area between the White and Blue Nile, in the Sudan, contained very similar figurines and was probably at least partly contemporary with Daima.53 Jebel Moya also had some flat-laid potsherd pavement and the edge-laid variety of such pavement was found at Daima in the upper part of the mound. Potsherd pavement is the third significant item of the Daima sequence to which special attention is called. Well-known in the archaeology of Ife and other places near the Guinea coast54, it was interesting to find it so far north. The edge-laid variety has also been observed by the writer weathering from the mound at Amkunchu in the Chad Republic and it is possible that in time it will be found to be a general feature of the Iron Age deposits of settlement mounds fringing the southern part of Lake Chad. The fourth type of find at Daima which seems to be of major interest is the iron beads found in Spits 23 and 24 and in a burial in Spits 25 and 26. These are similar to beads found with burials at Sanga in Zaire which are referred to the Kisalian. The Kisalian has been dated to the seventh- ninth century A.D. on the basis of radiocarbon dates for bone samples from two burials which actually contained such beads amongst their grave goods.55 The stratigraphic position of the Daima iron beads would indi- cate a date in general agreement with that of the Sanga specimens. Three main cultural phases are now proposed for the Daima sequence: Daima I, comprising Spits 5I/52-39/40; Daima II, comprising Spits 37/38-23/24; and Daima III, comprising Spits 2I/22-I/2. These would be technologically equivalent to Late Stone Age, Early Iron Age, and Devel- 51 F. Willett, 'A survey of recent results in the radiocarbon chronology of Western and Northern Africa', J.

The abandonment of Daima may well have resulted from the advent of Islam in the district. In the late sixteenth century, the Mai of Bornu, Idris Alooma, campaigned on the firki against the 'pagans', be- sieging and taking the town of Amsaka in I 575.57 This place is still occupied, and when visited by the writer the present village was found upon a settlement mound which, judging from surface finds, belongs to the same general culture as that of Daima. However, the mound-dwellers of the firki could have met the forces of Islam long before the sixteenth century. The wanderings of the Sefawa between c. I380 and c. I470 might well have brought them into contact with the inhabitants of the firki.58 Prior to this shift in Bornu's centre of gravity, from east to west of Lake Chad, there may have been a violent collision of Moslem and non-Moslem elements at an even earlier date. In the writings of the Arab geographer Al-Malqrisi (died I442) is a passage which may be derived from Ibn Sa'id (died I282) which could refer to this area. This passage records an invasion by the King of Kanem from Njimi in the year 650 A.H. (I252/3 A.D.) killing many of the inhabitants or enslaving them.59 Allowing for erosion and the statistical error of the last of the Daima radiocarbon dates, such an attack might well account for the general abandonment of the site. Apart from possible sporadic temporary re-occupation, Daima lacks the later part of the prehistoric sequence for the area south of the Lake. Field- work in Nigeria by this writer and the work of Lebeuf60 and others61 in Chad and Cameroon would suggest that the pre-Islamic sequence closes with a period in which burial within the huge pots already repre- sented in Daima III became common. Pot burial did not occur at Daima itself but an infant burial accompanied by 'bronze' pendants and carnelian beads was excavated from the surface of a settlement mound at Gilgil (Bornu 53), and another pot burial from Kala (Bornu 34) contained 'bronze', carnelian and glass. These huge pots are well known in Bornu traditions as the waterpots of the So, the giants who are said formerly to 56 The writer is unhappy about the chronological implications of such terms and has employed them merely because of their convenience. The term 'Neolithic' is to be avoided in this context. 57 Ibn Fartua (trans. Sir H. R.

Nevertheless the present inhabitants of many of the firki mounds remain in great debt to the makers of the huge storage pots. When the pots are uncovered by erosion, as is frequently the case, they are enthusiastically 'excavated' and put to use as dye pits, grain stores, water troughs and so on. Some villages have many of these pots in use although they are no longer made (Plate IV). It is usually claimed that they have been handed on for many generations but it is not clear whether all of them have been dug up at some time or whether some have been in continuous use since they were made.65 A practice possibly contemporary with the pot-burials was the enclosing of some of the mounds with an earthen bank and ditch.66 Many of the mounds which are still occupied have traces of such defences and it could be that their construction represents a response to increasing Moslem pressure from about the thirteenth century onwards. It is equally possible that many of them were constructed by Moslem rulers after they had taken over the area, but it should be noted that in the account of the siege of Amsaka the pagan defenders made use of such defences so that some at least of these earthworks must be pre-Islamic.67 Excavation at Yau (Bornu 6) The end of the Daima sequence overlaps with the Yau sequence (Fig. 2) and it is in the Yobe River area that we have a more certain idea of the later prehistory of Bornu. Four radiocarbon dates for charcoal samples excavated from Mound 368 at Yau (located at I3? 332' N., I30 I5' E. about 2I kilometres from the point where the Yobe River runs into Lake Chad) suggest that the settlement refuse of which this midden mound consisted was accumulating between about the ninth and about the thirteenth 62 These oral traditions are still alive and have been repeated to the present writer on many occasions. 63 J.-p.

He has also seen them in the process of 'excavation' by the villagers. 66 Barth recorded 'clay walls' at Ngala in i852 (A. H. M. Kirk-Greene, Barth's travels in Nigeria (Oxford, I 962), 2 I 9) but the eroded remains now visible at such sites make it im- possible to distinguish between free-standing mud walls and earthen dump ramparts: on this distinction see Graham Connah, 'New light on the Benin City walls', J. Hist. Soc. Nigeria, iII (I967). 67 Ibn Fartua, Reign of Mai Alooma. 68 Mound 3 was apparently the highest of a group of mounds numbering possibly I I in all. The maximum depth of deposit at Mound 3 was nearly 8 metres.</page><page sequence="33">THE DAIMA SEQUENCE 349 century A.D. (Plate V). Allowing for the 0o79 metres of deposit above the level to which the later date refers, and also for the possible loss by erosion of some of the highest deposits, this suggests that formation might have continued until about the fifteenth century. Again the termination of this site might have been the result of Moslem pressure; again we know that the forces of Idris Alooma in the late sixteenth century were subduing pagan 'So' in this area.69 The material culture indicated by the excavated evidence from Yau differs from that of the firki mounds, however. Iron- using throughout, the occupants had pottery of a rather limited range of types. Most of the decoration consisted of 'nodular' rouletting and various types of string rouletting. Some other rouletting occurred and some incised decoration. Sherds with a burnished slip, decorated by incision after burnishing, occurred rarely throughout the mound. Such Incised Burnished Ware, usually red-slipped, was formerly the 'fine-ware' of Kanuri pottery and a degenerate form is still in use. The people whose rubbish made up Mound 3 at Yau were great fishermen, judging by the large quantities of fish bones70 and the apparent net-sinkers made from old potsherds. They also made spindle-whorls from sherds and had a few grindstones. Con- spicuously absent were ground stone axes, bone tools, clay figurines and outsize ('So') pots. Excavation at Ajere (Bornu 9) Surface collecting indicated that the other midden mounds of the Yobe are probably of a similar date and culture to Mound 3 at Yau. At Ajere, near the present lake shore, a midden mound71 was test dug to 3.2 metres without reaching the bottom of the deposit. At this point excavation was abandoned for safety reasons but the material recovered was similar to that from Yau and perhaps therefore of similar date. Excavation at Birnin Gazargamo (Bornu I6) The former capital of Bornu, Birnin Gazargamo (Plate VII), is an import- ant and famous urban site approximately II7 kilometres south-west of Yau.72 Situated at I3' o' N., I2' i8' E., Birnin Gazargamo was founded in 69 Ibn Fartua, Reign of Mai Alooma. 70 These have been examined by A. J. and J. Hopson, formerly of the Federal Fisheries Service, Nigeria. Their report will be published with the excavation report on this site. 71 The mound excavated was apparently the highest of a group of mounds numbering at least 4. 72 Bivar and Shinnie, 'Old Kanuri capitals'. In 1957 Rosman and Cohen excavated at this site without approval from the Nigerian Federal Department of Antiquities. Their work was stopped and has never been published. The present writer has examined the excavated material in the Jos Museum and the Department files relevant to the 1957 work. The material at Jos would merit description and publication: some of the pottery is particularly fine.</page><page sequence="34">350 GRAHAM CONNAH about A.D. I470 by Ali, son of Dunama, and was abandoned after its destruction by the Fulani in I8I2.73 Excavations at this site bring our sequence into historical times. A single radiocarbon date of about the seventeenth century A.D. was obtained from charcoal and carbonized azara wood74 from a large midden mound 75 immediately to the south of the remains of the fired-brick palace in the middle of the site. Presumably the mound consisted of refuse from the palace and it is the largest of a number of midden mounds within the town wall of Birnin Gazargamo. Suitable material for radiocarbon dating was scarce so a pooled sample from between I *42 and 2.67 metres below the surface in a deposit 3 *40 metres deep was used.76 The midden contained fragments of fired brick from the nearby palace indicating that a rough contemporaneity to the structure was quite possible. The pottery from the midden included everted rim pots, and the same 'nodular' rouletted decoration as seen at Yau was common. String rouletting was rare in the Birnin Gazargamo mound, however. There were some incised patterns and some painting in red, the latter particularly on the inside of shallow saucer-like bowls, small examples of which were common as a pot-form. There was also Incised Burnished Ware in the midden. The small finds included barbed and tanged iron arrowheads, iron slag, spindle-whorls, grindstone fragments and domestic animal bones. A test cutting77 made into the brick ruins of the palace sectioned deposits 2.6 metres deep and uncovered brick walling still standing to nearly 2 metres in height (Plate VI). From this cutting came some particularly fine Incised Burnished Ware. The pottery was generally similar to that from the midden except that painting was very rare. Conclusions From the archaeological investigations so far completed in the Lake Chad region of Nigeria it is clear that there is great potential in that region for throwing light on later African prehistory. In particular the large number of high tells situated south of the Lake provide a rich source of cultural and chronological information. Already we begin to discern some patterns in space and time. Ecologically the region may be divided into two: the firki clay plains south of the lake and the undulating sandy country west of it. In the former, human settlement dates possibly from the early second millennium B.C., certainly from the early first millennium. The firki was attractive to human settlement because of a relatively fertile soil with great moisture- Bivar and Shinnie, 'Old Kanuri capitals', 2-3. 74 Borassus aethiopum (identification by the writer). 75 This mound is marked on the plan of this site (Fig. i) in Bivar and Shinnie, 'Old Kanuri capitals', as 'large mound'. 76 The sample was from Cutting II. 77 Cutting III. Cuttings I and II were in the midden mound.</page><page sequence="35">THE DAIMA SEQUENCE 35I retaining capacity but the very seasonal flooding which provided this moisture restricted settlement to a relatively few dry sites where continued occupation for many centuries (perhaps for 3,000 years on some of the sites still occupied) caused the growth of settlement mounds. The sandy country west of the lake presented very different circumstances. There is as yet no evidence for human settlement before the late first millennium A.D. The rainfall rapidly decreases as one moves north and water is not retained by the lighter sandy soils. The Yobe River, often called the furthest north all-season river78 (although it ceases to flow in the dry season it does not dry up), has provided a focus for settlement. Along the sides of the Yobe are many midden mounds but settlement shifted readily for agricultural reasons and settlement mounds did not grow up. From these two areas a chronological sequence emerges whose constit- uent parts have been discussed briefly in this paper. It is suggested that the two aspects of this sequence be designated 'Firki' and 'Yobe', the one possibly showing the evolution of Late Stone Age pastoralists into Iron Age cereal cultivators, the other showing an Iron Age village society which external stimulus generated into urban civilization. For this is surely what was achieved at Birnin Gazargamo by the sixteenth century A.D. Density of population, great urban defences, monumental building in fired brick, specialist craftsmen, government institutions, organized religion, and literacy: these and other things make such a conclusion inescapable. The prehistoric background of such a development in north-central Africa is one that merits far greater attention than it has yet received. SUMMARY An intensive archaeological field research programme conducted between I963 and I969 in the Lake Chad region of Nigeria has established the outlines of a prehistoric chronological sequence for the area. The excavations at Daima form the key to this sequence which also includes excavated evidence from Bornu 38, Kursakata, Shilma, Yau, Ajere and Birnin Gazargamo together with surface information from 70 other sites. Twenty radiocarbon dates indicate settlement of the area from the end of the second millennium B.C. (or the last quarter of the second millennium if the dates are corrected to calendar years) to the sixteenth or seventeenth century A.D. Evidence of occupation earlier than the second millennium B.C. may have to be sought in the highlands south of the lake area. In the firki clay plains, south of the lake, it may be possible to trace the evolution of a Late Stone Age pastoralist economy into an Iron Age cereal cultivator economy. In the undulating sandy country, west of the lake, village settlements focused around the Yobe River seem to have developed, in response to external stimulus, the urban civilization which historical sources indicate at Birnin Gazargamo by the sixteenth century A.D.

It is suggested that the prehistory of this region merits far greater attention than it has yet received and that the presence in this area of settlement mounds, with substantial depths of deposit, offers a wonderful opportunity for large-scale excavation programmes. Further surface investigations would also be justified, however, as the writer suspects that more prehistoric sites remain to be located in the area.</page></plain_text>
