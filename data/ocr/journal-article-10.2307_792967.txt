<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS SCIENTIFIC MAN vs. POWER POLITICS. By Hans J. Morgenthau. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1946. Pp. 245. $3.00. THE defeat of human aspirations following profound social upheavals is frequently accompanied by loss of confidence in rational methods as ways of resolving the problems of society. This fact is hardly puzzling to those famil- iar with the psychological and institutional conditions necessary to sustain rational effort. It is nevertheless a striking illustration of the force of roman- tic illusions that during periods of great social crisis even professional scien- tists often claim superiority for some oracular "higher wisdom" over the method of science. And there is at least the appearance of paradox in the fact that knowledge acquired through the operation of scientific method comes to be used as evidence for the alleged incompetence of that method to advance the understanding of social questions. Professor Morgenthau's book presents such a paradox. For it aims to show, in the light of evidence drawn from what is presumably a scientific study of human history, that many of our political failures have their source in the attempted extension of scientific method from the natural to the social sciences, and that this method is in- herently incapable of solving the problems of the social world. Mr. Morgenthau maintains that the rationalistic philosophy which supports the faith in the merits of scientific method misunderstands the nature of man, of the social world, and of reason itself. It misunderstands the nature of man, because it fails to recognize that men have spiritual and biological needs as well as rational ones, and because it thereby ignores the irrational forces that exercise supreme power in human action. It misconstrues the nature of the social world, because it does not realize that power politics, rooted in an ineradicable lust for power, is the basic feature of social life. And it mis- conceives the nature of reason, because it wrongly imagines that reason is causally efficacious in bringing into existence its own ideals, and because it mistakenly supposes that there are universal formulas of human behavior which reason can discover. According to Mr. Morgenthau, the world contains intrinsically irrational and evil forces constantly at battle with one another, so that it is not the harmonious structure "scientism" (his name for the philoso- phy of modern empirical rationalism) takes it to be. The knowledge required to direct into salutary channels the ineliminable struggle for power inherent in social life cannot be supplied by science. Such knowledge is the possession of the statesman alone,-of that rare creature who recognizes "the eternal laws by which man moves in the social world. ... The key to those laws. .. is in the insight and the wisdom by which more-than-scientific man elevates his experiences into the universal laws of human nature."' 1.

His actual fire, however, succeeds only in bringing down the already dead duck of 19th cen- tury individualistic liberalism. He makes telling though familiar criticisms of the shallow optimism and the tidy rationalism of what is essentially the phi- losophy of the Enlightenment; and he scores heavily against those who place a fatuous and sentimental reliance on mere "appeals to reason" for solving the problems of men. But he obtains a crushing victory over "scientism" only by using the debater's trick of so exaggerating the claims of empirical ra- tionalism that even to its proponents the views demolished are legitimate sub- jects for ridicule. For example, the view Mr. Morgenthau attributes to scientism, that the power of perfectionist ideals is sufficient to transform the actions of men simply through the rational force of those ideals,2 involves a conception of mind and reason that empirical rationalists themselves vigor- ously oppose as a superstition. Again, scientism undoubtedly is folly if a representative instance of the operation of scientific method in politics was the use of sanctions in the Italo-Ethiopian war;3 but, by parallel reasoning, the use of scientific method in medicine is also folly if the use of horoscopes by "scientific" astrologers may be taken as representing that method in the study of the outcome of some disease. A coherent view as to the nature of the scientific method he ostensibly criticises is not one of Mr. Morgenthau's prominent possessions. He ap- parently believes this method is competent to establish only "single tangible facts,"4 though he also seems to hold that it can be employed successfully only in those domains where events are subject to strictly universal laws.5 On the other hand, he accepts uncritically the interpretations of modern physics popu- larized by Eddington and Jeans; and by shutting his eyes to the great preci- sion with which many events can actually be predicted, he is able to affirm a radical "indeterminism" with respect to the behavior of all individuals6-as if the statistical character of current theories of sub-microscopic particles disproved the causal nature of macroscopic transactions. But Mr. Morgen- thau also declares that "The social sciences do not need to be brought to the level of the natural sciences; they are already there as far as the logical structure of their laws is concerned."7 He thus succeeds in leaving his readers completely at sea as to why, if this is the case, scientific method is less appli- cable in the social than in the physical domains of nature. In spite of all that has been written on the subject, he still thinks the plurality of causes and of effects are "facts" which a scientist must recognize as impediments.8 And he 2. P.173. 3.

The difficulties a social scientist faces in carrying on his inquiries are undoubtedly grave. Is it necessary to invent spurious ones ? Mr. Morgenthau's positive proposals as to how social problems ought to be approached exhibit an irresponsible romanticism. He rejects "scientism" be- cause its universalist conception of social laws is allegedly unhistoricall0- though already J. S. Mill, for example, was entirely clear that the principles of Ricardian economics are applicable only under certain historical conditions. But what is sauce for the goose is evidently not sauce for the gander, for as the passage cited above shows, Mr. Morgenthau has no scruples in affirming "eternal" laws, provided that "more-than-scientific" man asserts them. There can be no mistaking Mr. Morgenthau's low opinion of what controlled inquiry can contribute to the understanding of social processes, or his enthusiasm for men of "higher insights." He has the courage to say that "There is no indica- tion that the trained social scientist as actor on the social scene is more com- petent than the layman to solve social problems, with the exception of techni- cal problems of limited scope";11 and he does not hesitate to assert that "while fundamental social problems are impervious to scientific attack, they seem to yield to the efforts of ill-informed men who, while devoid of scientific knowledge, possess insights of a different and higher kind."12 Advances made through institution of rational methods of inquiry into such matters as public health, treatment of the insane, administration of the law, or education of the young, are apparently insignificant and merely technical achievements in his eyes! Just what social problems exist which are not specific and technical, is not clear from Mr. Morgenthau's rhetoric. And it is worth at least passing mention that the high esteem he exhibits for the daemonic "ill-informed" man endowed with a "higher kind" of wisdom, involves a fundamental surrender of critical intelligence to dogmatic authority. For to accept an insight simply because it is claimed to be a higher wisdom, is to declare as out of bounds the demand for a critical public appraisal of policies arrived at by such insights. The pinnacle of political wisdom, Mr. Morgenthau contends, is recognition of the tragic character of life.13 Life is necessarily tragic, according to him, simply because all action is inherently "sinful" and "evil"-sinful and evil, since the springs of action are "irrational" forces, and the consequences of our actions can be neither calculated in advance nor controlled.l4 However, 9.

For the term "irrational" is meaningful only if the term "rational" is-and how is one to conceive of "rational forces" if not on the hypothesis of an over-all plan and design? Indeed, Mr. Morgenthau's entire conception of human nature is built squarely on Calvinistic foundations, though without benefit of Christian theology. He defines the good life (with, however, a despairing "alas!") in terms of domination over others; but he thereby de- prives himself of any basis for evaluating political behavior except in terms of successful assertion of power. His political ethics is thus inherently amoral, and in his conception of things the anguish of those who have succumbed in the struggle for power must simply be accepted as part of the irremediably sinful character of the world. That Mr. Morgenthau should think this is higher wisdom is certainly good reason for adopting a tragic view of life! Mr. Morgenthau has misconceived the issue which those who see some hope in the extension of scientific method to social problems regard as central. His emphasis is on intuition and insight as sources of political wisdom, and he ap- pears to think proponents of scientific method wish to exclude artistic and religious experiences as contexts in which inspiration and belief may arise.17 But what is at stake in the debate between himself and "scientism" is not any question concerning the sources or origins of political ideas and values; what is at stake is the question how claims to knowledge and wisdom may be war- ranted. The recommendation to use scientific method is the recommendation of a way for deciding issues of factual validity and adequacy; it is not the recommendation of an exclusive way in which the universe may be confronted and experienced. Until Mr. Morgenthau recognizes this difference between questions of validity and of origin, he will be fighting with wind-mills. And until he proposes a better and more reliable method for establishing claims to knowledge than the method of science, his eloquence in behalf of "more-than- scientific" man will count as eloquence in behalf of intellectual obscurantism.
