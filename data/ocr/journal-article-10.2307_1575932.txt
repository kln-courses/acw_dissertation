<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPECIAL SECTION: DEVELOPMENT THROUGH IMAGES Scientific Theory as One of the Fine Arts Yona Friedman HOW TO READ THIS PAPER Science and art are both creative activities. They became sepa- rated only in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Before that time there was no precise boundary between them. Both science and art are based on observation and creative intuition. The objective of both is to communicate a represen- tation of the universe to a large public. Before the two domains became separated, there was much of science in art, and much of art in science. This came from the fact that both science and art appealed to common sense and neither was looking for proofs or personalized expression. In order to be valid, both science and art made use of state- ments that were considered credible and used "rules of com- position" that could be learned by all those who were interested. Today, we live during a revolution in both science and art, a revolution that advances by looking back. Science is beginning to rediscover both common sense and the importance of per- sonal expression. Theories are becoming emotional, expres- sive again; they transgress the austerity imposed by the obligation to present proofs. The role of intuition, as well as that of aesthetics, is again recognized. Scientific theory again shows a tendency to become a "work of art." Art, on the other hand, has objectives that only a short time ago were reserved for science. More and more frequently, artists attempt to paint a "portrait of the universe," mixing objectivity with emotions. Artists who endeavor to be objective, scientists who agree to recognize the subjectivity of their work: that is a renewal of the old. Many works have been published on the relationship between science and art. What has been lacking is an examina- tion of science as an art. I choose to present science as an art: a complex "whole" that transcends rules and that, by its sheer existence, can be an agent for development (in the sense described in my introduc- tion to this section). For that purpose I have tried to sketch a "composition," a "poetic" theory, based on both observation and creative intuition (which is itself a sort of emotional act). In doing thus, I have strived more for coherence and commu- nicability than for experimental proofs. Thus, the text that follows aims to build a new "mythology" (a term that I use for artwork that portrays the universe, even if in a naive and simplified manner). But, as with all portraits, it Yona Friedman (educator), 33, bd. Garibaldi, 75015 Paris, France. Received 10 August 1990. Excerpted from the book The Erratic Universeby Yona Friedman (Paris: Les Presses Universitaires de France, 1993). pretends to give a recognizable image of what is seen from that universe, in spite of its weak points. MAYBE GOD IS NOT A MATHEMATICIAN In our civilization, the image of the scientist is linked to that of a mathe- matician. For validation of a theory, we do not generally accept proofs other than those obtained through mathematical demonstration. However, it is evident that the major part of our everyday observa- tions does not relate to numbers, except in special cases. Certainly, numbers relate to our life in many respects, but we do not look at the world through mathematics. ABSTRACT The author argues the mythologies as world models have many advantages over mathematical approaches: they are easy to grasp, easy to communicate and almost limit- less in the ability to express the complexity and erraticism experienced in the universe. He sketches a "poetic," anthropomorphic the- ory that aims to build a new mythology, or world model, for understanding the universe as a whole. Indeed, we see the world through lenses that are familiar and emotionally close to us. Even in the most austere areas of sci- ence, we use terms such as "force," "attraction," "repulsion," "field," etc. These terms, accepted by all scientists, have been adopted from everyday human experience. Scientific language /24f '4C'4e C ..

The reduction of everyday human experience to a mathe- matical form impoverishes the model sci- ence proposes for representing the universe. Indeed, a model reduced to mathematical expressions keeps only those characteristics of the universe that belong to mathematics and neglects those features that transcend numbers. Common language refers to "quality" as those characteristics that resist quantifica- tion by mathematical formulas or sheer numbers. The world as we perceive and observe it displays other characteristics besides those quantifiable. I would call these other, presumably no-less-important ones "emotional." It is not my goal here to discuss the limits of validity or utility that are attributable to mathematical models. Rather I would like to consider those of nonmathematical models. A nonmathematical model should not be conceived for purposes of "vulgariza- tion" (what a horrible expression!), pre- senting a vulgar picture of some current scientific model. I am looking for a non- mathematical model because such a model offers more "richness" and is more coherent to our minds than math- ematicized theories that are too abstract for our "understanding" (a term we will discuss later). I find it funny when I read in the Bible, "God created man in his own image." Did God create man as a mathematician? Is God a mathematician? Who did create mathematics, and in whose "own image"? Indeed, God is no mathematician; nor are we. Mathematical concepts exist, cre- ated by humans, but these concepts map but an infinitely small fraction of the world as it is. WHAT TO EXPECT FROM A WORLD MODEL? Each of us creates an image of the uni- verse of our own-unique, indispens- able, and based on our direct and personal experience. That experience reflects first of all what our senses (or instruments) convey to our brains. As a matter of fact, the image we build to rep- resent the world for ourselves is con- ceived for our own exclusive use and is fashioned through those features of our experience on which we focus our atten- tion. As that image necessarily presents some gaps, its "author" uses imagination and invents some arbitrary features in order to complete the original image. XA ; To use another model: Each of us lives in a different, personal universe. Since the main endeavor of scientists is the unification of all these personal uni- verses, scientists search for the com- monality in all these images. The goal is to discover those elements of the "pri- vate" images that are "communicable." That is the first criterion for a scientific statement-it has to be communicable. A subject becomes communicable only if it refers, in some way, to that which we all know, i.e. it fits into all these personal world models. Modern science asserts that the language of ref- erence most accessible to all people is mathematics, i.e. reference to arith- metic (the fundamentals of which seem evident to all human beings). So claim the scientists! On the other hand, I began this reflec- tion by discussing the inadequacy of mathematical models. I am trying to find a language of reference more familiar than mathematics. We would expect this language to represent the complexity of our personal images of the universe bet- ter than mathematics does. At the same time, it is important that an image of the universe built on these principles not contradict mathematical models, but rather fill in their gaps. Indeed, the two images-the mathemat- ical and the nonmathematical-are based on very different references. Nevertheless, they are images of the same reality and could at some point together describe that reality better than one model alone. Many theories attempt to establish analogies between the models they pro- pose and the commonality of all person- al images. All mythologies, for example, were invented to explain human experi- ences in terms as familiar as possible. We need to be aware of one impor- tant feature of mythologies: they all attempt to construct an image of the universe that is as complete and coher- ent as possible. They do so by establish- ing precise relationships between facts, relationships that are often considered by modern science to be non-existent and imaginary. Such relationships might, indeed, be useless and erroneous if we accept that science's goal is to predict events and manipulate nature. At the same time, however, such relationships might contribute more to a person con- structing his or her own personal image of the universe than does mathematics. Mythologies strive to build coherent images, whereas moder science builds a patchwork of details. Mythologies never present gaps. We could categorize mythologies as a sort of "proto-science," since, fundamen- tally, they determine and orient our curiosity, formulate questions and suggest answers. Generally, scientists will come along later and formulate the same ques- tions (and answer them differently). The essential characteristic of all mythologies is their description of all perceptible features of the universe in terms of human behaviour. The refer- ence language of mythologies is there- fore that of human social behaviour. Their impact on human thought is the result of the fact that this reference lan- guage is directly and intimately known and experienced by everybody. Mythologies as world models have many advantages: they are easy to grasp, easy to communicate and quasi-limitless in their ability to express the complexity and erraticism experienced in the uni- verse. These are features not easily expressed through mathematical mod- els. Another advantage (and not the least) is that mythologies attend to even- tual gaps in the model they present, and at the same time suggest a way to fill those gaps. But their most important fea- ture is that they make familiar, through the "anthropomorphic" images they use, erratic facts that we experience. The way that mythologies operate is exactly opposite that of chaos: chaos the- ory looks for an underlying order in chaotic events; mythologies explain chaotic features that exist within all ordered systems. An example of this might be the fact that, even in mathe- matics, chaotic features are interwoven with order: for example, in the basic set of positive integers, there is no rule that determines the position of prime num- bers within that series. Thus, the most ordered set contains built-in erraticism. If current mainstream science neglects the erratic character inherent in the uni- 360 Friedman: Scientific Theory as One of the Fine Arts I I i\</page><page sequence="3">verse, or if it considers that we will eventu- ally get rid of all that erraticism, science will never succeed in presenting a coher- ent image of the world. On the other hand, mythologies might not be opera- tional, but they can achieve coherence. What we need is a sort of a "mytho-scien- tific, neo-anthropomorphic" theory, one that would stay operational by combining the findings of mainstream science with conjectures based on mythological thought. This type of theory would map features of the universe through images taken from the domain of human social behavior. Thus, a fusion of rational thought and an experience of erraticism could be achieved. Although anthropomorphic theories might not be operational, they can lead to a better understanding of the universe. COMMUNICATION, INFORMATION, KNOWLEDGE Before we can study the concrete ways to build a neo-anthropomorphic theory for understanding the universe, we need to examine in more detail the term "under- standing." What does "knowledge" mean, in the simplest sense of the decla- ration: "I know"? A frequent interpreta- tion of that declaration is to substitute "I know about" or "I am informed about" for "I know." As a matter of fact, "I know" is far more complex a statement than "I know about." Knowledge is far more than informa- tion. In day-to-day life, we are submerged in a flood of information, information that we do not transform into knowl- edge. Information includes all the mes- sages that constantly bombard our senses, even those of which we are not conscious. But information that com- mands our attention or consciousness is not necessarily knowledge either. For example, any object we encounter con- . - .: - I. * ,. . .-* -- ;m ~~~~~~~~~ tains a mass of information: form, size, composition, its role in the environment, its purpose (if it has any), etc. The largest portion of that mass of information, even that part of which we are conscious, stays uncommunicable. We do not know, for example, how to describe the form of an object to somebody over the telephone. Only that part of the information mass that refers to something "already known" can be communicated. For example, we can call an object triangular, or elephant- shaped (using the latter description only for people who know what an elephant looks like). Our first conclusion is that we cannot use information to create knowledge unless we already possess some "reference knowledge." Thus, the first step towards creating knowledge involves communicable infor- mation. But such communicable infor- mation in itself is still far from being knowledge; its content has to be inserted and fit into our "already known" person- al image of the world. Fitting new infor- mation into its right place in our world model is an operation we call "insight." It is insight that transforms information into knowledge. Information is only the raw material of knowledge, and insight is the tool for transformation. But neither information nor insight is "knowledge." Although information has to be com- municable in order to be transformed into knowledge, knowledge itself is not communicable. This is obvious if we real- ize that insight, the tool for fabricating knowledge from information, is a tool that cannot be shared. Insight, too, is not communicable. These statements are fundamental to our topic. A scientific theory (or a myth) has the purpose of conveying knowledge about the universe. But, as knowledge cannot be communicated, it conveys nothing but information; as for knowl- edge, each of us has to produce it, with his or her own unique and exclusive insight. This process transforms the raw material (information) furnished by the theory or myth. That knowledge that we produce belongs to us alone and is not transferable. A theory (or a myth), in order to be transformable into knowledge, has to appeal to the "already known" of a per- son and has to fit into that person's world model. Thus, a good theory (or myth) has to take into account the "already known" of the largest possible public. And, as we already mentioned, the largest "already known" is not mathe- matics but human behaviour. Personal experience about ourselves and those around us provides the most direct "already known" that can serve to create knowledge. ABOUT INSIGHT What precisely is "insight"? Can we define it in terms unrelated to its role in shaping knowledge? I defined insight previously as the oper- ation in which we fit new information into its appropriate place within our per- sonal, uncommunicable world model. Let me expand that definition. "Insight" is our drive to establish coherence among the facts that form our world model. Indeed, the insertion of new data into an existing set of data disturbs the exist- ing set. Our world model suffers an earthquake with every new bit of infor- mation; in order to limit the damage, we have to restructure the model. That restructuring is the function of insight: with every new infusion of information, our insight reshapes our personal image of the universe. A coherent image of the universe must have some specific features. First, its com- ponents need to be strongly interconnect- ed. This means that the system has to be complete and closed. Any new element incorporated into such a system expands the system, transforming it into some- thing larger yet incomplete. The inclu- sion of that new component makes inevitable the inclusion of other new components. This process means that an acceptable image of the universe has to proceed from completeness at its first lev- el to completeness at the second level, and so on. Our image of the universe, personal and arbitrary, is a living and dynamic one that needs to be reshaped continuously. This reordering is the most important role of insight: the continuous reshaping and readapting of one's personal world model to integrate new information. As I I / \ 6A- AF t4,4, A- &lt;^LO/ *(^ qt A, -&lt;4- z Friedman: Scientific Theory as One of the Fine Arts 361</page><page sequence="4">each of the components is important and indispensable, a personal image of the universe cannot be simplified or abridged. What we call insight is probably the most complex mental process a human being can perform. It involves the con- tinuous scanning and reshaping of an image, the complexity of which cannot be expressed through language, even through mathematical language. The presence of erratic events in the universe results from a hypercomplexity not necessarily of the universe itself, but rather of the image of the universe that we must build for ourselves. Our brains are accustomed to hypercomplexity and accept without much hesitation the exis- tence of erraticism in the universe as we perceive it. It is exactly that operation we call "insight" that makes erratic fea- tures acceptable. Acceptance of the fact that world mod- els are irreducible, are unabridgeable and include many largely erratic ele- ments corresponds to our day-to-day experience primarily in the domain of our own behaviour and that of our fellow human beings. That ordinary experience serves as a reference for our more abstract models of the world, which are based in either science or mythology or more generally a mix of both. The problem is that, even knowing that we live in a largely erratic universe, we feel a need for order. If that order does not exist, our intellect will invent it. This is the third role of insight: the inven- tion of a fictive order that we can fit onto our experience of an erratic reality. Human insight creates a world that differs greatly (but not completely) from the world presented by our day-to- day experience. "Information" that we perceive is presented by the "real" world; our insight transforms that infor- mation into "knowledge." We can "stock" but not transfer knowledge. Thus, we live within that partly imagi- nary world we "know," feeling comfort- able and only seldom finding conflict with the "realities" of the world that exists outside of us. It is our insight that creates not only the world in which we live but also our- selves as individuals and human beings. ABOUT MECHANISTIC AND NONMECHANISTIC THEORIES Let us start with a definition of the term "mechanistic": all models (and theories) that can be reduced to a "machine" or that can be represented or substituted for by a "machine" will be considered "mechanistic." A "mechanistic" model signifies a "linear" arrangement of com- ponents that, upon receiving the right impulse, operate in a predetermined way. The nonmechanistic operation does not lend itself to analytic description. One characteristic of a nonmechanis- tic model concerns the quality of its components. Such a model will have at least one component that cannot be substituted by any other "spare part," even if that part seems to be a perfect copy. A component possessing its own "individuality" will always behave in a unique and unpredictable way. In other words, such a component will seem to follow its own "free will." "Free will" does not necessarily mean that the behaviour of that component is conscious. Free will can trigger instinc- tive acts, too, provided those acts are deliberate. An action inspired by "free will" will be always be unpredictable (and generally incomprehensible) to the observer, in spite of all the informa- tion the observer might possess about the context of that action. Mathematics-if we consider it from a certain perspective-represents the archetype of mechanistic models. Indeed, mathematics can be reduced to or performed by a machine. Mathematics is based on two basic operations: "count- ing" and "abridging" (all numbers are, indeed, the abbreviated expression of the iteration of counting: one plus one plus one, etc.). But, even so, in mathematics each number is a unique entity having unique properties and not replaceable by any other number. We can obtain from this description a puzzling statement: Mathematics, seen one way, is mechanistic. Seen the other way, it is definitely nonmechanistic. In other words, mathematics is ambiguous. It is obvious that nonmechanistic models can attain a high degree of com- plexity beyond the reach of mechanistic models. It follows from this logic that nonmechanistic models are, therefore, better adapted to map hypercomplex realities. The best visual representation of non- mechanistic models comes from observ- ing the behaviour of living beings. It is impossible to describe such behaviour in an abridged formula, except by employ- ing statistical description. Such behaviour is fundamentally unpredictable and errat- ic. The same is true of human behaviour, although it, compared to animal be- haviour, seems to us more familiar, viewed, as it is, through our "insight." A theory of physics based on analogies to human behaviour is perhaps the best choice to represent the erraticism of a hypercomplex universe (rather than being rejected as incomprehensible). Obviously, such a theory cannot be built without showing some traces of animism. Animistic thought was too long a part of explaining observations for it to be dis- carded all at once, even if such thought might disappear slowly from the applied sciences. A good example of hypercomplex reality resulting from a small number of very simple rules is the game of chess. Indeed, the rules that govern chess are quite minimal, yet the repertory of all possible games is infinite. It is impossible to predict the course of any particular game on the basis of the rules alone, since the most complex component of each game is the mental processes of the players, the complexity of which is beyond our imagination. We can thus state that it is the mental processes of the players that transform chess from a sim- ple game with mechanistic rules into a reality that is fundamentally nonmecha- nistic (since any player's particular way of thinking is not completely determined by the rules of the game). Even the cre- ator of the game of chess could not imagine the detailed course of all games played or to be played. The previous statement is quasi-meta- physical. If we would suppose that the universe is ruled by only one basic law (a "law of nature"), even then a quasi-infi- nite number of "protagonists," each act- ing reasonably and within the framework of that one law but according its own "free will," would make the universe completely erratic and unpredictable even for its creator. The foregoing hypothesis is diametri- cally opposed to "chaos theory." Chaos theory attempts to transform nonmecha- 362 Friedman: Scientific Theory as One of the Fine Arts /Ab?o h4-1' - ow kadkP"-A : &lt;-e LAne,-</page><page sequence="5">nistic phenomena into a mechanistic model, uncovering "hidden" mathemati- cal rules. Our anthropomorphic theory, on the other hand, transforms a mecha- nistic vision of the universe (a mathe- matical model) into another, highly nonmechanistic, one. Anthropomorphic theory opens the door, in a way, to a new kind of meta- physics or, rather, to a new kind of mythology that refutes religious meta- physics. And it does so without employ- ing materialistic arguments. It would be an error to interpret the hypercomplexi- ty of the universe as the simple result of our lack of sufficient knowledge. It is the principle of "free will" of all components of the universe that leads to the implicit erraticism of the whole. This erraticism does not disappear even before the most accomplished intelligence imagined. A "POETIC" MODEL OF THE UNIVERSE According to the criteria we established as critical for the construction of a "neo- anthropomorphic" theory for the description of the universe, such a theo- 4A ALc' ALL lf- &amp; ry should first be a "communicable" one. It should refer to the "already known" of the largest public possible. The theory also should not be pro- foundly incompatible with the major results obtained by mainstream science. Rather, it should take into account, as well, those erratic phenomena that are not resolved by current science. The theory should be continuously aware of the enormous complexity of the uni- verse. Finally, it should accommodate the insight of individuals interested in obtaining "knowledge" and fitting the images proposed by that theory into their own individual "world models." These are extremely difficult condi- tions to meet, but still we must add one more. Besides all the constraints mentioned here, the theory should also be beauti- ful. It is through the aesthetic quality of a theory that we can combine order (what we would like to see within a world model) with disorder (the existence of what we feel). Well-ordered, erratic phe- nomena can be conceived only if they have a particular aesthetic quality. A phenomenon can be both well ordered and erratic; it is exactly this feature that triggers aesthetic pleasure. In another paper of mine, I used the expression, "a poetic message containing more than its literal content." Indeed, a "poetic" message is one that triggers insight through the emotions it raises. A poetic theory can be, in a sense, the most "true." The best theory is the one that pleases most. Building a theory is beyond science. It belongs to art.
