<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AZTECS-MEXICA AND DEATH: A Rebirth of Gods and Men Editorial Reflections on Aztec-Mexica Death Margarita de Orellana Ever since I can remember, Aztec was the term used in history books and in everyday parlance for the mag nificent culture conquered by the Spanish. The word Mexica was rarely used. Some experts argue that nineteenth century historians decided on Aztec as an attempt to empha size the origin of the people who emigrated from a place called Aztlán, and the word stuck - until recently. Specialists are now certain that the inhabitants of Mexico-Tenochitlan referred to themselves as the Mexica, which begs the question: why not call them by the name they called themselves? Therefore the title of this edition uses two words that are in fact synony mous: Aztecs-Mexica. Those previously unaware of this rec tification now know to use Mexica as the proper and correct word. The most important gallery in the Museo Nacional de Antropología is called the "Sala Mexica" for a good reason. In this edition we explore the Mexica s concept of mortality and how they represented death in their art. Each culture contem plates death and honors it in very specific ways; the Mexican way is a unique product of various social and religious syncre tisms. This is clearly seen in rural communities, as revealed in our sixty-second issue, Day of the Dead: Ritual Serenity. But it can also be observed in urban settings as shown in our sixty seventh issue, Day of the Dead: Skulls and Laughter. And our fifteenth issue, The Ritual Arts of Child Death, explores a lesser known aspect of this tradition. These issues all reveal age-old customs related to death still being practiced. Customs that shed light on a profound religious feeling and an aesthetical sensibility that never ceases to amaze. This almost naturally ignites our curiosity about the existence of pre-Hispanic roots to the unique ways in which the dead are honored throughout Mexico today. So we decided to devote the pages of this issue to the Mexica's concept of death; to study their funerary rites and artistic expressions; to ask ourselves how they envisaged their fate after death. Did they have a heaven and hell like the Christians? Did they fear life more than death? Did they have a concept of the soul, similar to the one brought over by the Spanish? How did they depict death in their art? This issue's stone and ceramic sculptures that are related to Aztec Mexica death indicate the significance that this people ascribed to death. They are truly monumental, bearing witness to the huge amount of creative energy that issued forth from these masterful artists' hands. They represent the grandeur with which they conjured up their vision of death. The great ex panse of these sculptures seem to burst out from the confines of these pages. And it is difficult for our contemporary eyes to grasp their meaning, for they were created with a vision so utterly different to contemporary aesthetical concepts. And yet their style is unique. What were the artists who produced these enigmatic sculptures trying to say? From these stones we can make out the exaltation of some kind of greatness. This issue provides some answers to the enigmas contained within Aztec-Mexica mortuary art, their funerary rites and their con cept of life and death, with contributions by authors who have spent many years studying their culture. Monica del Villar co ordinated this issue to include well-researched answers and astounding artworks. Eduardo Matos, key advisor for this is sue, explains that in this ancient civilization your eventual fate was determined by the way you died. He introduces us to the death gods, the pair called Mictlantecuhtli and Mictlancihuatl, as well as Tlaitecuhtli, whose sculpture was recently found near the Templo Mayor. He also explains the significance of other goddesses like Cihuateteo, Tzizimime, Coatlicue and Coyolxauhqui. We discover that men collaborated with the gods to keep the world from stopping, and how the Mexica saw life as an eternal process of rebirth. Ximena Chávez takes us on a tour through the various exequies and their meanings, and Lourdes Cué writes about the death of a goddess: Coyolx auhqui. Miguel León Portilla, in his towering Memorial nahua de la muerte (Náhuatl Memorial of Death) gives great insight into the Mexica's various concepts of death and their anxieties about life; and reveals the uncertainty that only Náhuatl po etry can express. This poetic dimension brings us back to the artistry of the stone carvings portraying the gods of death. In relating the uniqueness of Mexica art, Teresa Uriarte explains to us that the artists were properly trained and well-versed in the use of geometry and mathematics. They were capable of creating symbolic shapes to depict an artistic representa tion of the mythical vision of death. Their concept of art was as complicated as their concept of death. And this is one of the aims of this issue: to seek out the most impressive exam ples of this art and try to understand some of its precepts and meanings. Last but not least, I would like to mention Vicente Quirarte's contribution, featured at the end of the issue, which takes us on a literary journey to experience a Mexica warrior's feelings in the heat of battle. These contributions combine to create another vital and irreplaceable issue.

Aztec poetry known as "flor y el canto" expressed fear and uncertainty. An example of this is translated by Ángel María Garibay in Poesía náhuatl: "Will I see them there? / Must I set my eyes on the face / of my mother and my father? / Must they come to give me / their song and their word? / I look for them, [but] no one is there: / they left us orphans on earth!" Archaeology has uncovered a number of mate rial remains related to death, since early pre-Hispanic times. Throughout Mesoamérica, vestiges connected to death have been found and reveal diverse ways of viewing it. There are fundamental differences in the mortuary practices of Central Mexico and those of other cultures. For example, we know that among the ancient Maya, great rulers were interred in sumptu ous tombs, such as the ones found at Palenque, both in the Temple of the Inscriptions and Building XIII. In the case of the former, we can see how the pyramid built over Pacal's burial chamber has nine tiers that re ferred to the stages to reach Xibalbá, the Maya under world. Other tombs have been found in monuments, such as at Calakmul, Campeche, and at Dzibanché, Chiapas. In the Zapotee region at centers like Monte Albán, Zaachila, and Huijazoo in Oaxaca, the interior walls of a number of tombs are covered with color ful murals that depict rituals related to death. In the Totonacapan, Veracruz, some tombs resemble small shrines to preserve their sacred character. In western Mexico, meanwhile, so-called shaft tombs have mor tuary chambers where the body of the deceased was deposited. In general, all of these expressions accom panied by rich furnishings that served the dead on their journey to the place that was their destiny after death. However, the vestiges found in Central Mexico seem to obey a different set of rules. Since remote times, individuals were placed directly in the earth be neath houses, such as at Tlatilco in around 1000 BC, and later at Teotihuacan, both in the State of Mexico, where a large number of individuals have been found buried in flexed position directly beneath the floor of residential compounds as at La Ventilla and in other locations in that city. These burials that contained a variety of utensils were the final resting place of com moners. However, no tomb with exceptional contents or disposition that might suggest a high-ranking indi vidual has been found to date at Teotihuacan. A num ber of ceremonial burials with rich offerings have been found inside the Pyramid of the Moon and be neath the Temple of the Feathered Serpent in the Ciu dadela, but these were for sacrificial victims with their hands bound behind their back. Their burial responds to different purposes: to commemorate the enlarge ment of a building, to propitiate aspects of fertility, or for other purposes. Similar mortuary treatment prevailed in the Central Highlands among the Mexica or Aztecs. For instance, at Tlatelolco enormous numbers of burials were found with individuals in flexed position or placed inside large pottery vessels that served as a womb. However, more sumptuous tombs have not been found there either. Tenochtitlan displays a similar pattern. The first pos sible indication of a royal tomb that we have is the recently discovered slab of Tlaltecuhtli, Lord/Lady of the Earth, which seems to cover or at least be near the remains of a Mexica tlatoani (emperor). Fate after Death Death is the indisputable event that takes human beings to an inescapable destiny. Given this real ity, Nahua religion just as almost all ancient and modern religions in the world seeks the way to 'turn the table' and to allow people to transcend this fate. For this reason, it was believed that dif ferent destinations awaited the dead or their es sence. Unlike Catholic belief, in which the fate of the deceased is determined by moral factors (good behavior leads to eternal joy; sinful behavior means hell after death), what defined the fate of the Mexica after death was the way the individual died. In fact, we know of four such places described by the indig enous informants of Fray Bernardino de Sahagún. The first was to accompany the sun on his daily journey from sunrise in the east to noon. This was the fate of warriors who died in battle or were captured for sacrifice. Those who died in this way were to go to a plain (where wars were waged) and as the sun rose, armed with shields, they shouted war cries, just as they did when they engaged in combat during life. Each morning the sun rose to fight against his enemy, the stars that come out at night. Unlike others, those who died this way were cremated and after four years, they were transformed into birds that sipped the sweet 66 Eduardo Matos Moctezuma</page><page sequence="3">Skull-shaped cup, Polychromatic Ceramic, MNA. Photograph by Laura Cohen.</page><page sequence="4">nectar of flowers. Women who died in childbirth were regarded as Cihuateteo or "goddess women," because giving birth was conceptually equated with battle; if a woman died in this way, it was as if she had died in battle. Therefore, these women accompanied the sun from noon to sunset, for the west, where the sun hides, was regarded as the female direction of the universe. Warriors and women who died in childbirth were the only ones given this place of honor that we do not see in the fate of any other individuals who died. Those who succumbed to death related to water (from drowning, dropsy, gout, a bolt of lightning, and so forth) went to Tlalocan or the place of the Water God, Tláloc. In his General History of the Things of New Spain, Sahagún stated: "And so they said that in this earthly paradise, which was called Tlalocan, it was eternally green and summer." These individuals were buried with amaranth seeds spread on their jaws and blue pigment on their forehead, in addition to adorning their body with paper. There was a third place known as Mictlan. This was the destination for all those who died from any other type of illness or, as Alfredo López Austin says in Cuer po humano e ideología (The Human Body and Ideology), those who had not been chosen by any particular god. Once the person had died, words were addressed to the corpse to the effect that at death, everything comes to an end, as Sahagún also commented in his General His tory: "that place is for everyone and it is very wide and there will be no other memory of you," and the Fran ciscan continued by saying: "you have already gone to the extremely dark place where there is no light, no openings, you do not have to leave there, you do not have to be concerned about your life here and your past." The corpse was placed in a fetal position, with legs drawn up to the chest and wrapped in paper and mantles. Once the mummy bundle was prepared, water was sprinkled on it and the places that the deceased had to cross to reach Mictlan were recounted: between two crashing mountains; on a path guarded by a ser pent; by the place of the green lizard; by eight barren lands and hills; by the place of the cold, obsidian-bladed wind; across the Rio Chiconahuapan riding on the back of a small reddish-brown dog. It is likely that before undertaking this journey, the individual had to be de voured by Tlaltecuhtli, Lord/Lady of the Earth. These trials were also referred to in the Codex Vaticanus A with some variants: crossing a river; crossing between two hills or mountains; passing the obsidian hill, the place where banners wave; the place where people are shot with arrows; the site where hearts are devoured; the obsidian place of the dead; and the place without any smoke hole. Apparently, Mictlan was envisioned as a womb to receive the dead; the earth, which was the womb in which corn seeds were planted to be born, was also where the dead remained in Mictlan to wait to be born. I have commented on other occasions, as in Muerte a filo de obsidiana, how there is a possible con ceptual relationship between the nine steps to Mictlan and the duration of pregnancy. Furthermore, when an individual died, he had to undertake the return to the original womb, for which he had to overcome these dangers, just as to be born he had to face nine periods of suspension of the menstrual cycle and the vicissi tudes of pregnancy to finally be given life. There was a fourth place where dead children went, namely Xochatlapan or Chichicuauhco. These babies drank milk from the nursing tree until they were to return to earth again. The Gods of Death Mictlan was presided over by the couple, Mictlantecuhtli and Mictlancihuatl, the Lord and Lady of the Place of the Dead. Archaeologists have found diverse images of them and other figures associated with death. A num ber of artworks are related to death; in fact, some of them are true masterpieces. Let's begin with sculptures of Tlaltecuhtli whose function was to devour corpses and to send them on to the fate that had been given to them. The most impressive representation of them is the monument recently uncovered in front of the Tem plo Mayor, mentioned earlier: it is the largest Mexica sculpture that has been found to date. It depicts a god dess magnificently carved in volcanic rock, the center of which served to balance the entire figure. Her flexed arms and legs are painted yellow and end in sharp claws. The enormous head displays a headdress composed of a skin covered with curly hair interspersed with ban ners typical of sacrificial victims. Her association with death is underscored by her skirt covered with crossed bones and skulls rendered in black and white, in addi tion to the skulls on her elbows and knees. A stream of red blood flows from her navel to her mouth. The article "La diosa Tlaltecuhtli de la Casa de las Ajaracas y el rey Ahuízotl," published in the magazine Arqueo logía Mexicana, points out that the orientation of the image—head toward the west and spread legs toward the east—makes it possible to interpret that the image had devoured the tlatoani (presumably Ahuízotl, based on the glyph of the year of his death in "10 Rabbit"— 1502—discretely placed in the claw of the right foot). The emperor, as the sun, was swallowed by the earth in 68</page><page sequence="5">the afternoon to be reborn as the new sun that rose in the east in the form of his successor, Moctezuma II. Perhaps the two categories posited by Salvador Tosca no and later by Paul Westheim—the terrible and the sublime—are represented here. The image was a ter rible figure for its function and sublime for its aesthetic quality. It is also worth noting that no specific festival was known to have been held in a given temple in this deity's honor. Of the excavations in the Templo Mayor of Tenochti tlan, extremely well-carved stone vessels representing Mictlantecuhtli were found as offerings. They are of the caliber of superb lapidary artists, anonymous craftsmen whose skill was praised by Sahagún's indigenous infor mants. The two life-sized, terracotta figures identified as Mictlantecuhtli were found standing on benches in the House of the Eagles, the structure immediately north of the Templo Mayor; they flanked the entrance to a room where skulls were painted on the stucco of the doorway Leonardo López Luján, in his book La Casa de las Agui las, refers to these pieces to show that the Mexica were not only skilled stone carvers, but also masters in creat ing fired clay sculpture. Figures found prior to the Templo Mayor exca vations form a fairly large corpus of images of these deities. In addition to the ones mentioned above, all of these representations are partially fleshless. Stone sculptures, such as those of Mictlancihuatl, stand out for the quality of their workmanship or the Cihuateteo with their fleshless face and raised hands, the carving of which are outstanding examples of death imagery. Not to be overlooked are the large number of skulls that often served as architectural decoration, such as those set into the wall of the altar-tzompantli [skull wall or rack] on the north side of the Templo Mayor. To com plete this survey, I would add the image from the Codex Borbonicus in which Mictlantecuhtli appears in profile opposite Tonatiuh, the Sun God: light and dark, day and night. . . Throughout these examples what is striking is the way that pre-Hispanic artists imbued death with life. The Life-Death Duality Why this abundance of skulls, crossed bones, skeletons, and other expressions related to death? The answer can be found in the thought of Mesoamerican peoples. Farmers par excellence, they witnessed the changes that took place throughout the year: a rainy season in which plants were born, grew, and produced fruit, and a dry season without rain during which everything died. The repetitive cycle of this pattern led man to develop a fundamental belief in the pre-Hispanic world: the du ality of life and death, expressed in their calendar, in their gods, and in their worldview. I will end with an observation that I made years ago concerning death among the Mexica: "A Cult to death, or on the contrary, a cult [...] through death." Translated by Debra Nagao. RITUALS FOR REBIRTH Mexica Funerals Ximena Chávez Balderas Funeral rituals play a practical as well as sym bolic role. They serve to dispose of the corpse, so that relatives can mourn and help the de ceased enter the world of the dead. This is confirmed by the work of Louis-Vincent Thomas, the foremost exponent of the study of the "Anthropology of Death." Among the Mexica, rituals began prior to the demise of an individual and continued after the funeral. These could be divinatory in nature, to determine if the sick would die, or to be able to avoid death through a de ity's intervention. When the end was imminent, the dying received some remedies to prepare his or her soul for the inevitable journey. Funeral Rites When the unavoidable time of death arrived, exequies ensued. Despite the diversity of Mexica funeral prac tices, it is possible to speak of a general structure that included preparation of the body, rites conducted in the presence of the deceased, the placement of the corpse, solemnities at the tomb, and subsequent ceremonies. All of these stages were accompanied by funeral music, ritual dance, autosacrifice, speeches, and in the case of the funeral rites of a ruler, the sacrifice of his compan ions. Differences between Mexica exequies depended on the cause of death and the social status of the de ceased, which determined the duration of the ceremo ny, the treatment of the corpse, the quality and symbol ism of the funerary furnishings, as well as the type of sepulcher. Thanks to the research of Alfredo López Austin, we know that the Mexica believed in the existence of three souls: the teyolia, the tonalli, and the ihiyotl. The first resided in the heart and was connected to vitality or knowledge; it was the immaterial entity that undertook the journey to the beyond. The tonalli was housed in 69 Debra Nagao. Ximena Chávez Balderas</page><page sequence="6">the head and was connected to fate, force, and heat. Fi nally, the ihiyotl, located in the liver, represented vigor, base passions, and could be used to cause damage at will. At the death of an individual, these last two souls were dispersed on the earth. When individuals died a death connected with wa ter, their teyolia or soul traveled to a paradise of fertil ity. Their body was dressed in paper ornaments, seeds were placed in their mouth, a wooden stick in their hand, and blue pigment was rubbed on their forehead. Their body was buried in the earth, as if it were a seed, which marked its immediate incorporation into the fu nerary geography. When warriors died in battle, their funerals were sumptuous public affairs, held in the plaza in front of the Templo Mayor. It was believed that the teyolia of those who died a glorious death on the battlefield or on the sacrificial stone traveled to the Realm of the Sun to contribute to the functioning of the universe. In these cases, the mourners sang and the widows danced bent over toward the earth. However, it was not always possible to bring the bodies back to Tenochti tlan: this depended on the proximity of the place of death and the identity of the deceased. Most of the time, the bodies were not recovered and they remained on the battlefield. The absence of the cadavers meant that the mourners had to make bundles made of branches that were dressed up and adorned to take the place of the body. These wood bundles were cremated with their offerings and the ashes were collected to be buried. In this way, the mourners could carry out their bereavement ceremonies. When a woman died during childbirth, the body was washed, dressed, and adorned, and her hair was arranged in the traditional woman's hairdo. She was buried in the patio of the temple dedicated to the Cihuapipiltin god desses. Her body had to be watched over for four nights, because it was highly coveted by warriors and thieves. The former attributed the body's hair and middle fin ger with supernatural powers, while the latter believed that the left arm would help them rob houses, because it would render its inhabitants immobile. It was believed that individuals who died from ill ness or old age undertook a journey to the underworld: Mictlan. To reach this cosmic destination, the mourn ers had to begin the funeral by preparing the mortuary bundle and by dedicating offerings to the deceased. In formal speeches they described the route that had to be followed and the dangers that awaited on the journey. The body could be either cremated or buried, depend ing on the identity of the deceased. In the event the body was to be burned, the corpse and offerings were placed on the pyre. And so they were transported to the funerary destination. The burned remains were gathered and deposited in con tainers to later be buried. Despite the fact that Fray Ber nardino de Sahagún stated that all people who died an ordinary death were cremated, other sources suggest this was not the case. Other men of the cloth, such as Fray Toribio Benavente, known as Motolinia, and Fray Diego de Landa, as well as conquerors such as Fran cisco López de Gomara confirmed that cremation was a costly funerary arrangement reserved solely for the elite. Archaeological evidence corroborates the use of cremation at funerals of important individuals. Funerary Rituals at the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan At the Huey Teocalli, the Templo Mayor, seven urns with cremated bone remains were buried in the middle of the temple dedicated to Huitzilopochtli, the war god, an avatar of the sun and the patron god of the Mexica. Given the correspondence between their treatment and funerary geography, these individuals might have died from natural causes or as a result of war. From AD 1375 to 1427, during the reigns of Acamapichtli, Huitzilihuitl, and Chimalpopoca, four of the seven urns were placed at the summit of the temple, the shrine to the war god. This space was the site of greatest religious importance in Tenochtitlan and it was symbolically related to the victors. The other three urns have been associated with the vanquished, for they were discovered on the tem ple platform, near the monolith of the goddess Coyolx auhqui and it is believed that they were deposited there from AD 1469 to 1481, in other words, during the reign of Axayácatl, the sixth Mexica tlatoani. The cremated bone remains were analyzed with techniques used in physical anthropology and forensic science, which yielded the following results. The vestiges of the individuals buried in the Huitzilo pochtli shrine displayed a complexity not described in historical sources, because only two individuals were deposited in the four urns. Both individuals were be tween the ages of 21 and 24 when they died. One of them was buried in the northern part of the shrine, in a bowl and a dog-effigy vessel made of so-called plumbate-ware, manufactured in Guatemala centuries prior to the construction of the Templo Mayor and pos sibly obtained by the Mexica during their incursions in the ancient city of Tula. The other individual buried in the shrine was also male. His bones were divided in two small urns with the effigy of the god of death. They 70</page><page sequence="7">were deposited at the base of the pedestal that held the image of the war god, which suggests that it was the body of a dignitary. Historical sources mention this as the spot destined for the burial of rulers. If these accounts are correct, the tomb might be that of Chimalpopoca, the third Mexica ruler. Unfortunately, we do not have sufficient evidence to be certain of this identification, for historical records provide contradictory informa tion on the age and death of this ruler. Furthermore, the bone remains of both individuals were incomplete. Analysis revealed that about 20 percent of their bones were interred in this sacred space, as if they were relics. We do not know the fate of the rest of their remains, but perhaps they were divided among the mourners or placed in other buildings. In contrast, the three individuals deposited in the building's platform tell a completely different story. Two of them probably died at the same time, although they were cremated in different pyres. Because the fire did not reach high temperatures, some of the bones have been preserved in fairly good condition. They were placed in extremely fine orange ceramic vases. One displays the image of the god Tezcatlipoca, while the other shows Mixcóatl, the god of hunting; both deities are depicted dressed as warriors. The cremated individuals were male and one of them was between the ages of 21 and 24 when he died. One individual showed the ante-mortem loss of his four upper incisors, which suggests he had a violent occupation or suffered an accident. Analysis of the signs of occupational activity, carried out by physical anthropologist Martha Elena Alfaro, was revealing; both individuals had highly marked muscular insertions in the arms and legs, which indicates that they carried out intense physical activities from an early age. This data and the iconography of the funerary urns seem to cor roborate Eduardo Matos's hypothesis that they could be warriors who died in battle. The third individual buried in the platform yielded less information, because only a few bone remains were recovered. Funerary Goods A wide variety of objects were deposited in the tombs in the Templo Mayor. However, we cannot regard them as offerings, for they served diverse functions and showed diverse symbolism. These funerary goods may be grouped into four categories: the first was mortuary furnishing composed of gifts for the dead to serve on the journey to the otherworld, such as the clothing and footwear to protect the body on the inhospitable jour ney to Mictlan. It also included food, drink, weapons, and tools to perform tasks in the world of the dead. Then there were accoutrements, insignia, or trophies that served as a reminder of the individual's status or identity, and of the deceased's connection with a cer tain god or with the individual's accomplishments dur ing life. These included earflares, lip-plugs, nose-plugs, necklaces, the symbolic attributes of deities, or trophies alluding to the warrior status of the deceased. Other objects may be regarded as offerings that the deceased was to turn over to Mictlantecuhtli. This was the case of mantles or cloaks, skirts, shirts, colored thread, bunches of torch, and reed vials of perfumes. Finally, there were goods that other people offered during the funeral, such as mantles for the shroud or wood for the pyre. Although it is not possible to specifically identify the function of each object recovered in archaeological contexts, we can offer a general panorama. The bone remains of dogs were part of the furnishings placed for the journey of the dead to the underworld, because the dog was to help his master cross the Rio Chico nahuapan to Mictlan. The falcon bones, meanwhile, might allude to the journey to the Realm of the Sun. A group of objects that might also be tied to funerary geography stands out, because they are connected to the movement of the forces of one level of the universe over another. The predominant shapes of these arti facts are round or spiral, and there are also images of ducks, birds that were one of the naguals of the wind god, Ehécatl-Quetzalcóatl. These objects included gold bells, silver pendants, greenstone pectorals, as well as magnificently made representations of ducks, rings, spiral-shaped obsidian beads, strands of greenstone beads, white stone, rock crystal, and obsidian. In ad dition, there are extremely fine, translucent earflares carved from obsidian. Finally, there were miniature projectile points, which might have been deposited as insignia or as part of the belief that they would be used in the otherworld to perform some activity. Rituals after the Funeral The rites did not end with the body's burial, for offer ings were made four, twenty, sixty, and eighty days lat er. Other rituals were carried out such as the ceremony known as the 'relics of tears.' According to Fray Diego de Durán, widows were not to wash their face or fix their hair for eighty days. Once this period came to an end, the elders removed the crusty bits from the widow's face. Priests gathered the tears, the wailing and weep ing to take them away with the sadness. In this way, the widows returned calm to their homes, for the pain in their tears had been removed from the city. The dead were also remembered in some of the veintenas 71</page><page sequence="8">[twenty-day months] of the ritual calendar. This was the case of miccailhuitontli, hueymiccaühuitl, quecholli, tititl, and tóxcatl. During these celebrations, the were offered gifts, prayers, and they were brought to mind. However, the complexity of these festivities went be yond the funeral of any single individual. Death in Light of the Conquest With the arrival of the Spaniards, the progressive and violent imposition of a new worldview affected funer ary customs. Wars and epidemics led to a large number of deaths, so it was impossible to carry out the funerals and rites of times past. Furthermore, the creation of in stitutions such as hospitals, the prohibition of burying corpses in homes, and the imposition of fee payments changed the entire funerary panorama. In addition, the beliefs of the religions recently brought from overseas prohibited cremation, for this went against the idea of resurrection. At this point another journey began: a change in the areas of life and death. Translated by Debra Nagao. MYTHICAL REBIRTH Coyolxauhqui The Death of the Goddess Lourdes Cué The Sun and Moon can never be together, with the exception of those brief instants in which she is caught in some corner of the diurnal sky. Then she was driven away by the one who destroys her on a daily basis, at daybreak, when she is annihilated by his ray. The life and death cycle of the sky gods par excellence—the Sun and the Moon—is an astronomi cal phenomenon of such dimensions that it merits an equally portentous myth. The Myth The Mexica inserted into the Mesoamerican pantheon, populated by multiple gods, a family that fulfilled their philosophical, cultural, political, and economic needs. The goddess, Coatlicue, personified the earth; she was the mother who, night after night, drew her body on the horizon for her daughter, Coyolxauhqui, She of the Bells Painted on Her Face, the Moon, and the centzonhuitz nahuas (the four hundred stars), the southern stars. The inception of this family began with an inexplicable miracle. Coatlicue was impregnated by a small ball of feathers that fell from the sky while she was sweep ing her temple on the top of Coatepec or Serpent Hill. This mysterious event deeply offended her daughter, Coyolxauhqui, who instigated her brothers to kill their mother. However, the ball of feathers that Coatlicue held in her womb was Huitzilopochtli, the Sun; when he became aware of the danger, he decided to fight from the womb of his terrified mother. When the death of Coatlicue was imminent, Huitzilopochtli was born, fully dressed as a warrior and armed with a fire serpent, the xiuhcóatl, which represents the sun's ray. He used this weapon to decapitate Coyolxauhqui and cast her down from the hilltop, from where she fell dismem bered, mirroring the appearance of the Moon at any moment of its cycle. The myth of Coatepec is reproduced in the Tem plo Mayor where, just as in the myth, Coyolxauhqui lies defeated at the foot of the stairway of the victor, Huitzilopochtli. However, the myth does not only express an astronomical phenomenon in which the Moon disappears in the presence of the sun; it also speaks of a historical fact recorded by Fray Diego Du rán. It was a struggle between two Mexica factions, which took place during the migration from Aztlán, when a group headed by Coyolxauh rebelled against the authority of Huitzilopochtli, who punished their breach of discipline by sacrificing them all a few days before reaching the spot where Tenochtitlan was founded. The Piece One of the representations of the mythical Coyolx auhqui is the well-known, monumental stone disk dis covered in 1978. Its dynamic composition synthesizing frontal and profile views evokes the sensation of vig orous, whirling movement in the trunk and the open spiral of its extremities in the shape of a pinwheel. This movement seems to be generated from the point where the decapitated head is dramatically flung back, and continues toward an arm, a leg, and the other leg, and the other arm. However, the forms do not exceed the bounds of the relief; instead the sculptor managed to balance expansion and dynamism by harmoniously confining the figure within the disk, while placing em phasis on points of visual attraction at the joints, hands, feet, and headdress. More than thirty years after its discovery, the poly chromy, the biological elements, and the iconography of the monolith were addressed anew. Furthermore, the five colors that were embedded in the porous stone were studied in depth to reveal the red came 72 Debra Nagao.

All of these coincided with the colors used elsewhere at the Templo Mayor and on neighboring buildings. These colors ap pear on details, such as the blue nipples, spots of red blood on the thorax, the reddened eye rendered as in the codices, the blue panache, and other elements that open new lines of enquiry. The naked body reveals other visual qualities, such as the quality of the carving produced without metal tools, such as hammers, chisels, and so forth, but other hard stone implements to define the fine details, and with sand used to polish the edges of the relief. The Goddess and Her Attacker Since her discovery, Coyolxauhqui has become an icon of ancient Mexican art, but at the same time, she has been the source of inspiration for unrealistic and even farfetched interpretations. She is capable of express ing both myth and history. In her capacity as a female goddess, she was inspired by more ancient deities who were also related to death: the Cihuateteo, the brave women warriors who dwelled in the western realm of the universe after dying in childbirth. Coyolxauhqui is represented as one of these warriors: with her bare torso shown frontally, painted ochre and with folds on her lower belly. The Cihuateteo, as the goddess herself, shared attributes with the ancestral goddess Tlazoltéotl Tlaelcuani, patron of sexuality, childbirth, and men strual cycles, associated with phases of the moon. This representation of Coyolxauhqui seems to have been inspired by both deities, which confirms her lunar es sence and her identity as a dead deity. Her status as a sacrificed warrior is also evident in the use of armlets, anklets, wristlets, and feather panache, insignia associ ated with warriors, and because of the ornament char acteristic of mortuary bundles and sacrificial victims, composed of small white downy feathers and a bundle of two feathers clearly shown in this relief as separated from the rest of the beautiful blue headdress. There are three iconographie elements that Coyolx auhqui acquired from her attackers and that reinforced her identity. The first are the small snail shells of the genus Polinices cf. lacteus that adorn her anklets. These motifs are emblems of dead warriors, associated with sacrifice and with fiery entities such as Huitzilopochtli. A second element is the large blue headdress, the col or of the daytime sky, the main sphere of action of Huitzilopochtli, inspired by the feathers of the Golden Eagle (Aquila cf. chrysaetos) that symbolizes the sun, because it is the bird that flies highest in the sky. This halo-like portion is composed of the feathers that cover the upper part of the wing and that bear a hanging ele ment inspired by the bird's long tail feathers; the sculp tor reproduced all of these aspects with obsessive fidelity in size, shape, and details such as the shadow produced by the overlapping of the feathers. A third iconograph ie element is the false coral snake with striped body (Tantilla cf. annulata) knotted on different parts of the goddess's body. These reptiles were associated with the Cihuateótl, who represented women who died in childbirth, and above all with Tlazoltéotl, the Goddess of Filth; this is important given the relationship be tween the Cihuateteo and Coyolxauhqui. However, in this piece, the serpents have two heads: they are the fearful maquizcóatl, mythical snakes associated with death. Coyolxauhqui, bedecked with all of the possible symbols of warfare, sacrifice, and death, emanates an unquestionable beauty that deeply moves those who behold it. She embodies the mythical drama that repro duces the cosmic battle. The Sun and Moon can never be together, although they are inextricably linked in the indissoluble dance of life and death that is captured in this dynamic piece. Translated by Debra Nagao. REBIRTH WITH WISE MEN'S WORDS Nahua Memorial of Death Miguel León-Portilla Throughout time and space, testimonies reveal the existence of a profound human concern: the certainty of death and the uncertainty of what might follow. Is there utter annihilation or a transition to a beyond hitherto unknown? Numerous expressions in the rich literary legacy of the ancient tradition pre served in the Náhuatl language give life to a memorial that reflects a concern among Aztec wise men known as tlamatinime. This preoccupation is exemplified in the following poem from Cantares mexicanos: "It is true that we leave, / truly we part. / We leave the flow ers, the songs, and the earth. / It is true that we go; it is true that we part! / Where do we go, oh! Where do we go? / Are we dead beyond, or do we yet live? / Will there be existence again? / Will the joy of the Giver of Life be there again?" Man is tormented by the doubt over what death might bring. Other sources reflect on alternatives for 73 Debra Nagao. Miguel León-Portilla</page><page sequence="10">what one's fate in the beyond might be: "Where will I go? Where will I go? / Straight is His dual road, His road, God's. / Perhaps people are awaited in the place of the fleshless, / or in the heart of the sky? / Or is the place of the fleshless / only here on earth?" For the Nahua people, concern about death covered much more than one's personal existence. In their world view and cyclical concept of time, their anguish encompassed the entire reality of the universe. Numer ous accounts remain —in sculptures with inscriptions, in codices, and in Náhuatl texts— that record the idea of the destruction of the world and periods of darkness. The well-known Sun Stone (also known as the Aztec Calendar Stone) and other sculptures record the various cosmic ages, referred to as "Suns." Each of these came to a violent end. These monuments also depict the calendrical sign of the present age, nahui ollin, "Four Movement." Several texts describe the origin of this cosmic era. It is said that the restoration of the Sun required the death and sacrifice of the gods at Teotihuacan. Literally, it said: ipamapa in teteo topan otlamacehuaque, timace hualtin, "because the gods wanted to do penance, they gave themselves in sacrifice, and we are the deserving.'' As a result, humans must reciprocate by transmitting the energy from blood to the Sun. The roots for the practice of human sacrifice may be found in that pri mordial event of the restoration of the Sun and life. Consequently Náhuatl texts and images from some codices show what might happen if the Sun were to become weak and the sacred fire, which is the augury of life, were not lit. As shown in the Codex Borbonicus, every fifty-two years, when it came time to renew the sacred fire, all people awaited whatever might hap pen with a mixture of eagerness and apprehension. In fact, they were certain that one day, when earthquakes and impenetrable darkness filled the earth, the world would come to an end and then, citing the ancient words from the Anales de Cuauhtitlán, "tipolihuizqui", "all of us shall perish." However, at the same time in Náhuatl thought, the idea arose that death could be followed by rebirth. An other poem in Cantares mexicanos insinuates this no tion: "Truly earth is not the place of reality. / Indeed one must go elsewhere / [beyond happiness exists.] / Or is it that we come to earth in vain? / Also the mythical account concerning the flight of culture hero Ce-Ácatl Topiltzin Quetzalcóatl, í-Reed Our Prince Quetzalcóatl, according to a recent interpre tation by Patrick Johansson in "La mort de Quetzalcóatl: un modèle exemplaire pour les obsèques des seigneurs mexicains", reveals a similar idea. After succumbing to the trickery of hostile gods, Quetzalcóatl was forced to abandon the metropolis and the cultural grandeur that he had created. An ancient Náhuatl song speaks of his downfall and says that when he left Tula, he left his people burdened with affliction. It speaks of his end by stating: "Now our Prince is mourned. / To the sound of shell trumpets / he advances to his end, / he goes to the beyond, to Tlapallan, / the land of the red color." The text goes on to mention the places that Quetzal cóatl passed through on his way to the coast. According to the version recorded in Náhuatl by Fray Bernardino de Sahagún, "once he arrived there, he built a dwelling within the earth, in Mictlan, the Region of the Dead. And although it is believed that he perished there, he later appeared on the coast, where he made a raft of ser pents that took him to Tlapallan, the Land of the Color Red. His ultimate demise, which took place there, was simultaneously an end and the beginning of another existence. After lighting a bonfire and surrounding himself with precious birds, Quetzalcóatl threw him self into the fire. His heart rose into the sky, where it became Huey Citlalin, the Big Star, the Morning Star, to always defeat death, for by becoming a star, like the sun, he governed time and represented life itself." It is precisely in mortuary rituals for great rulers where the flight of Quetzalcóatl is somehow evoked. The ruler left his city and his people and headed for Tlapallan. Thus, his body arrived in the Region of the Dead, but when it was consumed by the flames, it came to life in the company of the gods. The ritual words uttered before the mummy bundle adorned with its mortuary insignia can be better un derstood in light of these beliefs, fust as Quetzalcóatl, he had to be consumed by the fire to be able to cross the nine waters to join the Lord of the Region of the Dead. Before reviewing the acts that formed part of the funerary rites, I will quote the words, compiled in the Florentine Codex, that the priest addressed to the deceased, wrapped up and prepared for cremation: "Oh my son, you have found your breath; / you have suffered, / our lord has been merciful to you. / Truly our common abode is not here on earth. / It is only for a little time, / only for a moment that we have been warm, / only through the grace of our lord / have we come to know ourselves. // But now Mictlantecuhtli, / Lord of the Region of the Dead, / he who is Acolnahuá catl and Tzontémoc, / as well as Mictecacihuatl, / the Lady of the Region of the Dead, / have presented you, / they have provided you with a seat, / for there is our common home, / there where we all perish, / there where the earth opens up, / where one leaves this world forever. 74</page><page sequence="11">// You have brought yourself to the place of mystery, / the place of the unfleshed, / the place where there is arriving, / the place with no smoke hole, the place with no fireplace. / No longer / will you make your way back, / you cannot return. / No more will you come to know / what you have left behind / five, ten days ago. / For you have gone leaving / orphans, / your children, your grandchildren. / No more will you know how they will perish. / We shall go to reach you, / we shall go to ap proach you / after some time." Similar, although not identical, beliefs have survived among Nahua groups today. Take, for example, the case of the so-called "Mexicaneros" who live in the south ern part of the state of Durango. Their words, recorded at the beginning of the twentieth century by Konrad Preuss in Nahua Texte aus San Pedro Jicora in Durango, were addressed to the deceased to presage an auspi cious fate: "O, God, Our Little Mother, / you have made your son depart from here, from the world, / you had great need for your breath of life / and so, you sought your breath. / Take what you will receive, your cord, / for you have made him emerge here, / from here for the world that is there, / for here shines all that is good, / here all grows green. / Because surely work has taken place, But, what can we do? [...] // You have left us poor, we who are his children, / here in the world. / We would like / Our Little Mother to give us her breath of life, / because we do not possess it / but we shall not return here, / we pray to Our Little Mother / who is there / where the sun sets, / may she grant us her breath of life, / but we do not know. / But here I return, / I ask for her favor, / so that you can go there beside Our Little Mother, / for she has called you / there to glory, / for she has called you there, / what can you do? [...] // For Our Little Mother will now / cut short our steps, / but so, forgive me, / that I have not approached there / the word of God, Our Little Mother, / instead I have sat here / and I have given you something of little value [...] // You already suffered work. / Just as you now [suffer] / shall we suffer tomorrow, the day after, / just as [you], we will go / for now Our Little Mother / calls us there / where she is, / where there is resplendence, / where flowers dazzle [the eyes]." Destinations after Death In contrast to Christian beliefs, in which the final des tination of the soul is determined by the good or evil actions of the individual during life, among the Nahuas the ultimate fate of the deceased was linked to how and when the person died. For them, good or evil behavior met with its immanent reward or punishment on earth. The four possible realms for the deceased were de scribed by Fray Bernardino de Sahagún and accounts, including the Codex Vaticanus A. The first fate is the one that corresponded to the ma jority of people. It was known by different names. One was Mictlan, the Region of the Dead. It was also known as Quenomamican, which probably means "Where One Somehow Finds Oneself." Another designation was Xi moayan, "Place of the Fleshless." It was the destination of those who died a natural death on earth. The text in Náhuatl in Sahagún describes it as follows: "And there to Mictlan, the Place of the Dead, / went all those who died on earth, / who died only of sickness; / the rulers, the commoners [...] // For there is our common home, / there is our common place of perishing; / there, the earth spreads out / and extends forever". The dead who go to Mictlan have to pass through dark, treacherous places before reaching their destination. In the ancient account it is said that before presenting oneself before Mictlantecuhtli, Lord of the Region of the Dead, four years had to pass during which the de ceased had to overcome several tests. As part of the rites, Sahagún relates how the people spoke to the deceased of the trials that awaited him: "Here is where you will pass / where the mountains come together. / And here is where you will pass by the road / which the serpent watches over. / And here is where you will pass / by the blue-green lizard, Xochitonal, / the sign of the flower. / And here is where you will travel the eight plains / and you will emerge at the eight hills. / Here is where you will pass the place of / the obsidian-bladed winds. / [There] it is said that there was much suffering. / All the obsidian blades and stones / were swept along by the wind. / It was said that whoever went to pass / looked over to a dog. / And when he recognized its master, / it jumped into the water / to carry its master across. // Hence the natives / took care to breed dogs. / And it was said that white dogs and black ones / could not carry their master / to Mictlan. // It was said that the white one said, / "I have just washed myself." / And the one which was black said: / "I have just stained myself [black]." / Only the yellow one / could carry one across./ And when they arrived / With Mictlantecuhtli / they gave him the various things / with which they had adorned / the dead here on earth. / And there in Chicunauhmictlan, / The nine places of the dead, / In that place there was complete disappearance". Although this was the fate of those who died a nat ural death, another fate awaited those who had been chosen by Tlaloc, the God of Rain. His selection was expressed in their death, which came about in close 75</page><page sequence="12">connection to water: those who drowned, those who were struck by lightning, as well as those who had gout, dropsy, or those who had sores on their skin. Descriptions of Tlalocan may be found in the ac counts collected by Sahagún. In fact, there is even an image of this paradise in the ancient mural in the pal ace of Tepantitla at Teotihuacan. The text in Náhuatl characterizes Tlalocan as follows: "There the people re joiced, / they enjoyed it very much. / Never did they suf fer. / Never did the ears of green maize, / the gourds, the squash blossoms, / the heads of amaranth, the green chi lis, / the tomatoes, the green beans, / the cempoalxochitl [marigolds], fail. / And there dwelt the tlaloques, / who were like the offering priests [...] // So they said that in Tlalocan / there is always the putting forth of young shoots, / there is always sprouting, / it is always spring, / it is continually springtime." Nahua priests, in response to the friars in their dia logues on religious matters, also spoke of Tlalocan as a paradise. It is likely that when the priests heard them, these Franciscans rightly thought of an earthly para dise as it was described in the Bible. Another fate also related to Tlalocan also correspond ed to small children who died at a young age. They went to occupy the shadow of the Chichicuahuitl, the nurs ing tree, whose branches yielded milk. An image of this tree appears on folio 3v of the Codex Vaticanus A. These children remained there for four years, after which their teyolia, breath of life, was sent back to earth to the heart of a woman who would be their mother. Warriors who died in battle or sacrifice, as well as women who died in childbirth, went to another, high ly different place: they were converted into the Sun's companions. The Florentine Codex describes it as fol lows: "It is said that they lived together where there was a place / that was like a barren plain. / When the sun appeared, when it came forth, / then they made a din, they howled; / shields were struck together. / And he whose shield was pierced by arrows / in perhaps two or three places / could see the sun there, / but he whose shield was nowhere pierced by arrows / could not see the sun; he could not look into its face". And as for what occurred in the end to those war riors, the text continues by saying that: "And when they had passed four years there, / then they changed into precious birds / they sucked honey [from the flowers] where they dwelt". Being converted into companions of the Sun was a glory desired by many. A number of poems and other texts attest to this honor by proclaiming that the heart yearned above all for death by the obsidian blade. As for women who died in childbirth, in this same codex Sahagún has recorded the words that the mid wife addressed to the young woman who lost her life in giving birth. Among other things, the midwife said to her: " And now awaken, arise, stand forth, / for already it is day, / already it the dawn has come [...] // Arise, stand forth, array yourself, / take yourself to the good place, the pleasing place, / the house of the Sun, / who is your mother, your father. / May your older sisters, / the Cihuapipiltin, celestial women, / take yourself to him, / those who are always, forever glad, / content, joy ous, happy. / My youngest one, my beloved maiden, / my noble woman, / you have suffered fatigue, you have suffered manfully, / you have won our lord's place [...] / You will forever live, / be glad, be content / beside our ladies, / the Cihuapipiltin". fust as fallen warriors, these brave women became companions of the Sun. The text in Náhuatl states: "And when the sun had emerged, / when already it had advanced along its course, / when those who had died in war, / the brave warriors, / already came gladdening it, / came giving cries for it, / when this sun had already advanced along its course, / then the women arrayed themselves, / armed themselves as for war, / took the shields, the devices. / Then they rose up; / they came ascending / to meet the noonday sun there [...] / And the women / brought down the sun / As they bore it / they went gladdening it with war cries. / They left it there, it is said, / where the sun enters." The belief that warriors accompanied the Sun from sunrise to the zenith and the women from that point to sunset left its mark on Mexico's geography. Precise ly in the direction of the west, there are a number of sites that bear the name of Cihuatlán or Cihuatlanejo, which mean Place of Women. Funerary Rituals Those who believed that the deceased went to one of these destinations made every effort to help the dead on their journey to the otherworld. Some sources de scribe these rituals in general, while others deal with how the death of a specific individual was celebrated, usually a noble or a sovereign, the latter known as huey tlatoani. Among those who describe mortuary rituals on some of those occasions, the most outstanding accounts are by Mexica chronicler Hernando Alvarado Tezozó moc (in his Crónica mexicana), Dominican Fray Diego Durán in his Flistoria de las Indias de Nueva España, and Franciscan Juan de Torquemada in his Monarquía indiana. 76</page><page sequence="13">Meanwhile, there are descriptions of mortuary ritu als not referring to any specific individual described in other sources. These include the testimonies gath ered by Sahagún, codices such as the Magliabecchi, Vaticanus A and the Mendoza, as well as the Manual de ministros de indios by Jacinto de la Serna. This range of sources offers a panorama of the principal ritual prac tices in pre-Hispanic funerals. The corpse was placed on a sort of dais covered with a woven mat. A lock of hair was cut from the back part of the head that was joined with another that had been cut at the time of birth. The reason for this, according to Durán, is they believed, "there resided the memory of the soul and the day of his birth and death". The body was then bathed and wrapped in a shroud. A jade bead was placed inside the mouth as a symbol of life. In the case of nobles, the body was wrapped in lavish cloaks and given varied offerings. The dead body remained completely covered in the form of a quimilli or mummy bundle. When it was prepared in this way, words such as the ones cited above were uttered before the bundle. The words evoked the brevity of life and expressed the wish that the deceased reach his destination in the be yond. Once the speech came to an end, it was followed by a lament, and in some cases, people danced or cried out before the body. A variety of miccacuicatl, songs of death, were also sung before the deceased. If the dead individual was a noble, they undertook a solemn procession toward the place where the body would be cremated. Among the people of the town, the mummy bundle was simply carried to where the pyre was to be lit. When the deceased was regarded as cho sen by Tláloc, based on the way the individual met with death, the body was buried. When the rites were for high ranking individuals, slaves were sacrificed. These victims were known as tepandacaltin or companions of the dead, who were to serve him in the otherworld. The obsequies lasted for four days, during which offer ings of food and drink were made. Cremating or burying the body, the ashes or the body were buried in a hole that was called óztod, cave. The burial site thus evoked the place of primordial origin of the people, who were said to have come from the Seven Caves or Chicomóztoc. In addition to all of the activities involved in the funerary rites, the dead were commemorated at several times throughout the year. Two celebrations were con ducted in the veintenas (twenty-day months) known as Miccailhuitontli and Huey Miccailhuitl, names that mean Small and Large Celebration of the Dead, respec tively. Chronicler Juan de Torquemada wrote about these events: "The small commemoration of the dead, because in it they conducted them in the temples, sing ing them sad songs and attending it with great sor row and the ministers called tlamacazque dressed in black cloaks of ichtli, which are cloaks that they call of henequen and they brought many offerings of corn and chili, squash and beans, and many other vegetables in memory of their dead." After describing how the dead were commemorated in this Small Ceremony of the Dead, Torquemada goes on to describe Huey Miccailhuitl, the Large Festival of the Dead. "The people of Tlaxcala as well as others referred to it in this way because in this month they solemnly hon ored the memory of the dead with great clamor and cries and greater mourning than the first and they dyed their bodies black and they blackened their entire face. And so, the ceremonies were held day and night in all the temples and outside of them, there was great sadness, according to which each individual would express his feelings. And in this month, they referred to their dead kings as gods and all of those individuals singled out for having died bravely in wars or in the power of their enemies and they made their idols for them and placed them with their gods, saying that they had gone to the place of delight and gone in the company of other gods". In addition to these two celebrations, the dead were recognized at others. In the seventeenth month of the year, called Tititl—a word that means "narrowing"— honor was paid to those who had died a natural death or of old age, while in the thirteenth, Tepelhuitl, a cele bration in honor of hills, the people recalled those who had been chosen by Tláloc to die a water-related death. Death was a recurrent theme, if not an actual obses sion, among the ancient people of Mexico. One of their spiritual legacies is perhaps the commemoration and frequent allusion to death that has endured in modern Mexico. It is true that since the arrival of Christianity, death has taken on many different meanings. Never theless, at least among a certain number of people, the uncertainties implied by what follows the end of exis tence on earth have not disappeared. Thus, for some, and I include myself, the words of the tlamatinime re tain their meaning: "Do the flowers go / to the Region of the Dead? / In the Beyond, are we dead / or do we still live? / Where is the source of light, / since that which gives light hides itself?" Or consider these incisive words, an expression of deeply rooted doubt: "The road to the region of death is straight, / the road to the Region of the Dead, Tomoyan, Ximoayan. / Is it really possible to live in Quenonamican? 77</page><page sequence="14">/ Perhaps we believe it in our hearts?/ In the chest, the cof fer, you enclose the people, you hide them, Giver of Life. // Perhaps I shall see them over there, / perhaps I shall contemplate your countenance, / my mother, my father? / Perhaps they will come to give me their song, / their word, that I miss. / No one cares about the rest, / we were left orphans on earth." A sort of conclusion is needed. Despite the fact that the Nahuas had deeply rooted beliefs and complex ritu als surrounding death, there were some wise men, tla matinime, among them who raised doubts. In view of the inescapable certainty of death, they embraced the uncertainty of the beyond. They posited questions that emerge in their songs and poems in connection with the end of life and other subjects, such as the possibil ity of saying words of truth on earth. This is why I have ventured to insist that these wise men developed a true system of thought and enquiry that can be defined as Náhuatl philosophy. F&amp;é Translated by Debra Nagao. REBIRTH OF BEAUTY The Mexica Aesthetic of Death Maria Teresa Uriarte The true artist takes everything from his heart. Miguel León-Portilla Miguel León-Portilla has commented that the word and song were identified with flowers among ancient Náhuatl-speakers, and thus with beauty and aesthetics among the Aztecs-Mexica. In his text on Nahua philosophy, he speaks of their art and how their houses, their pottery, their masks, their songs, and their paintings were the fruit of the Toltecáyotl, the wisdom that came from their predeces sors, so that the notion of artist came from the Mexica conception of the Toltec people. The ancient people of Mexico cultivated what we know as the performing arts, including not only dance and song, but also theatrical representations and com munity activities, including other art forms, such as ar chitecture and visual arts. In Mexica thought, both the notion of beauty and that of art were extremely complex. Therefore, both fol low a structure and a logic that might at times seem strange to us. For instance, looking at the Coatlicue and appreciat ing her beauty is not easy. Although our eyes can per ceive the harmony of her proportions and symmetry, it is necessary to understand the context in which she was created to understand the profound symbolism embodied in the representation of Huitzilopochtli's mother. However, harmony, symmetry, balance, and composition are values that the human eye perceives and accepts universally without bringing to bear any other process. No matter the time or place, human be ings unconsciously seek these features; they are intrin sic to our nature. We can speak of an aesthetics that was deeply val ued by the Nahua people. In most of their buildings, sculptures, and paintings, the laws of the golden mean or ratio in geometry are applied with precision. It is not accidental, nor something that they had devised. As Beatriz de la Fuente demonstrated in her studies on Olmec colossal heads, since ancient times as far back as looo BC the ancient inhabitants of what is today Mexico City had a clear notion of mathematics and ge ometry that they applied to construction. The Mexica consolidated their territorial, commercial, and ideological domination, which may be confirmed based on remains found at sites far away from the heart of their empire. As a result, art among the Mexica played a fundamental propagandistic role. Its central message was the recognition of the ruler as the center of all time and space, which was not a new idea among Mesoameri can cultures. The figures of their gods were reproduced as symbols of a spiritual supremacy. He Who Speaks with His Heart Art may serve us to reveal the diverse facets of the indi vidual we call the artist and who has many other faces. Artists, as we have seen, were aware of mathematical principles and applied geometry, so they designed their works and planned their cities always adhering to rules of proportion. They also had in-depth knowledge of the qualities of lime plaster and the behavior of other ma terials, which allowed them to execute extraordinary sculptures and murals that have survived the passage of time. If we analyze each one of their visual expres sions, we can see how the sciences are implicit in all their artworks and how artists were trained in all of these disciplines. Artists had to employ their knowledge and had to be able to transmit the political message of rulers to strength en the idea of Mexica supremacy. However, they also had to have been born on a propitious day, on a day governed by the day sign Flower, and they had to seek refinement, 78 Debra Nagao. María Teresa Uriarte</page><page sequence="15">as León-Portilla has pointed out, to be able to commu nicate with their own heart. Therefore, in addition to acquiring the skills necessary to become good artists, they had to be capable of carrying out inner work as well. Therefore, there was an aspect that not only con cerned the individual's ability and predetermination, but there was also a dimension in the field of ethics. Fray Bernardino de Sahagún repeatedly recorded this and Miguel León-Portilla has confirmed it. Fragments of Náhuatl songs allude to this interior dimension: 'The bad painter: shrouded heart' or 'the bad featherworker: does not heed the face of things, devourer, pays little attention to others, like a turkey with a shrouded heart' and thus, we can apprehend the qualities identified with those who have acquired not only skill, but also have reached a level of perfection in the inner dialogue with their own heart. Death and Mexica Aesthetics Among the cultures in Mesoamerica, history cannot be extricated from myth. Therefore, to speak of death as we understand it today is no easy task. For the Mexica, death was a state of difference that was integrated into their world view through comple mentary opposites. The Cantares mexicanos describe death as the 'place where one truly lives' and although León-Portilla studied different ways of seeing death, I believe that the Cantares provide a useful key to un derstanding Mexica's representations of the beings that dwelled in the Region of the Dead. Take, for instance, the two monumental clay sculp tures of Mictlantecuhtli that were found in the Templo Mayor. Both death deities have long hair with stars or star eyes and insects. In these pieces, there are holes where hair must have originally been inserted, prob ably human hair. The place of death, which was described in differ ent ways, was also known as the place of the fleshless. However, representations of death depict it as living death or death alive, which can be seen in these splen did sculptures: the ear flares, the sockets with eyes, the nose, the tongue, for example, suggest an animated body full of life and not a corpse. The image of Mict lantecuhtli in the Codex Magliabechiano does not have fleshless arms and displays claws or long nails on his hands. His legs and feet seem to be those of a living body in which we can also see his liver, when in nature the soft parts of the body are the first ones to decom pose and disappear. Depictions of death deities do not always represent corpses. For instance, the diorite head of the goddess Coyolxauhqui (She who Wears Bells on Her Cheeks) in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City displays the inert head of the goddess: her eyes are half closed and her face seems flaccid, deathlike. She wears small feathers characteristic of sacrificial victims in her hair. The sculpture is a closed form, massive, distant from any intrusion of light; she is in darkness, in the realm of death. However, the spectacular relief of Coyolxauhqui found at the foot of the Huiztilopochtli temple and that gave rise to the excavations at the Templo Mayor, show the enemy-sister-goddess, symbol of the moon, of night, of coldness in a circumvolution of movement. Simon Martin has connected this position to corn deities at the moment of rebirth, which makes me wonder whether Coyolxauhqui is portrayed in this swirling position to make her return to the earth, as the moon wanes and dies each month. Coatlicue is another example of these representa tions that we might refer to as liminal, because, as in the sculpture of Coxcatlán or that of the Cihuateteo from Calixtlahuaca, and the Tzitzimime in the Codex Magliabechiano, they are women who are dead and at the same time very much alive. The underworld, the place of the dead, is also the place of creation, and therefore these half-dead deities or half-alive deities are in a process of decomposition and at the same time in the process of returning to life. And it is among Meso american cultures that a natural process of death and rebirth can be seen: it is as if death were the grain of corn from which life began, Translated by Debra Nagao. ABORTED REBIRTH Tenochtitlan, June 30, 1520 Vicente Quirarte My heart knows it: my father's peoples will soon exist no more on this earth. It is day break on the third day of the twenty-day pe riod called the tecuilhuitontli. The battle has ended, yet the air still seems fraught with the clash of weap ons, the war-whoops of my people's brave warriors, the barbarian curses of the teúles we fought for nine whole days. At my tender age I have never taken up arms: I am ignorant of the arts of war. But my seniors have brought me to this room where my father is living out 79 Debra Nagao.

They make me repeat over and over what I must pass on to my people. More than in mem ory, I register the night's events in my blood. "Remember that your father, who was a tlacochcál catl, was, too, a man of intelligence. He learnt how to bring the invader's armaments down to earth. He saw through and beyond things; in time he knew that the fire-sticks were not divinities; he was among the first to start awake from hearing the thunder and seeing the flame in the mouth of cannon, as they call them. Later on, he laughed at being untouched by death, and our men laughed as he did. From that they learned that the four-footed beasts were not immortal, and that just as the weapons of the teúles cut our men down, so too the obsidian flakes of the macuáhuitl could wound. Your father saw too, before anyone, that of all our weapons they most feared the tlacochtli; he perfected the art of throwing darts at them where they were naked. "Keep in mind that the city was our first ally: the streets and canals of Great Tenochtitlan clogged the ad vance of their beasts and their armaments. The city was another warrior, and for that you owe it reverence. Vic tory cost us many men. Our warriors discov ered that against the new weapons, our shields were useless. They went into battle like clouds, clos ing ranks to form a single body. Learn, as they have, that there is no T: 'I' does not exist. They fell to save the city which now is yours. Remember the feast of Tóxcatl in the days before to night, when our people were killed by the cruel one whom they call Pedro de Alvarado, and we call Tonatiuh. Our patience broke and our men attacked the teúles with a new fury. Every man grasped his weapons and dedicated himself to fight to defend the city. Even the Acolhuas and the Tepanecs were with us. Hold within your ears, en grave on your memory that conch-shell that sounded the alarm on the night of the rout. Our limbs were weary, yet the sound that summoned us to war was like the music of a feast. Remember the rain from heaven and the rain we made ourselves, raining down stones, spears and ar rows on to their bodies. Men and beasts, arms and gold of our temples, fell in the dust. Greed found a dead end in the city's canals. "Do not forget this night. Never before were the gods so much with us. Remember, above all, the mo ment when your father entered the region of life and death. To assuage your tears and soothe your heart, remember how the captain of the teúles wept beneath the ahuéhuetl as he watched his beaten army go by Under that tree where some say they saw him weep ing, we shall hold a great feast. Keep this night in your memory as the most joyful in our misfor tune, this night when once again the city is ours, and yours to defend, for the war is scarcely begun." /¡S»g£ Translated by Timothy Adès.
