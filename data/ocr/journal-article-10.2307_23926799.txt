<plain_text><page sequence="1">Literature &amp; Theology, Vol. 13. No. 3 September îgçç THE MARGIN IS THE MESSAGE: COMMENTARY'S DISPLACEMENT OF CANON Christopher Burdon Abstract A canonical text is traditionally seen as authoritative and sacred, with any commentary on it a subsidiary or explanatory exercise. But the style and page design of official commentaries suggest that they wrest to themselves the authority supposedly belonging to the canon. Examples are given from both Jewish and Christian commentary from the fourth to the twentieth century. Contrasts are drawn with looser modes of reading such as lectio divina and liberationist use of the Bible: while these generally eschew commentary and are less concerned with scriptural authority, it appears that in practice they endow the text itself with greater transformative power. I want to look at the effects of commentary on canonical texts, particularly where the text is seen as authoritative. Any such commentary should logically be clearly subordinate to the text, dedicated simply to enabling a more informed reading or a more fruitful encounter between the sacred text and reader, church or synagogue. In practice, I shall suggest, the inevitable effect of commentary when a reader approaches it with such desire for understanding or authoritative guidance is to wrest the authority to itself and away from the canon. So the text becomes pretext for the exercise of power by the official interpreter, scholar or magisterium—perhaps too by the reader if she is sufficiently identified with the interpreting authority. I am not claiming that this process is necessarily deliberate or malign: rather that a genuinely critical reading of commentary should unveil this deception. If such an unveiling (or apocalypse) can be achieved, this gives the critic—and all the Bible's reading communities—the duty to examine whether any text as text can exercise authority. So the underlying question is an ethical and an ecclesial one. The five commentaries I am focusing on are diverse in their methods and range from the fourth to the twentieth century. But they have in common a high regard for the canonical text, a sense of pastoral duty towards their readers and some kind of official or representative status. In each case I shall look at the commentary's treatment of part of the Jacob stories in Genesis, © Oxford University Press 1999</page><page sequence="2">CHRISTOPHER BURDON 223 referring also to its visual impact on the page. I will then suggest other ways of reading (or perhaps performing) scripture which eschew explicit comment ary but which may ironically be endowing the text with greater freedom and power than the official versions. The first instance of commentary is rabbinic midrash, as exemplified in Genesis Rabbah, which dates probably from the fourth century CE but incorporates an interpretative style and traditional material from several gen erations earlier. Midrash is notoriously prolix, spinning a web of puns, echoes and allusions from within scripture and beyond, stringing them together with quotations and controversies from diverse rabbis and usually avoiding the enunciation of one authoritative meaning of the biblical text. But to conclude from this that the rabbis intended to produce an endless concatenation of texts that constantly defer meaning would be misleading: what distinguishes midrash both from the talmudic material and from looser aggadah and meshalim is precisely its specific relation to the canonical text. It is presented as authoritative commentary on an even more authoritative writing. In Gary Porton's words, 'the central feature of a midrashic comment is its explicit relationship to the Bible'.1 However far it strays, however many other texts it intrudes, the discussion returns to the next verse or phrase of Genesis that is being commented on; and the exactness with which its grammar and letters are examined is owing to the rabbis' constant acknowledgement of it as divine speech—logos, if you will. That is the theory, at any rate. In practice, the more Derridean reading of midrash carries a lot of force. In the actual entering of the beth ha-midrash and reading of the rabbis' arguments, the words of Genesis easily get lost and seem less interesting than the quirky interpretations and juxtapositions they give rise to. So if we look at the story of Jacob's so-called reconciliation with Esau after his encounter with the man (or angel, or Elohim) at the Jabbok, we find a mixture of careful attention to the text, perverse misreadings of it and alluring wanderings from it into argument and story-telling where the connecting threads seem extremely thin. Why, for instance, is Jacob's daughter Dinah not mentioned with his wives, maids and sons at the crossing of the Jabbok? Because, says the commentary, her father had hidden her in a chest to protect her from the lascivious Esau. The angel's plea, 'Let me go, for the day is breaking', leads to a lengthy series of dialogues both between the rabbis and between Jacob and his antagonist, filling out the sparse canonical text with speculation on the daily praises of the angels and on other angelic encounters in scripture, intersected with verses from the Psalms and Lamentations. Then at the actual meeting in chapter 33 the midrashists change nasaq into nasak, so that instead of 'kissing' his brother Esau 'bites' him (Esau being generally read as imperial Rome).2</page><page sequence="3">224 COMMENTARY'S DISPLACEMENT OF CANON Yet it is often in these wanderings that the interest lies, both for the practical purpose of the self-definition of the Jewish community in the late Roman Empire and in the breaking into the beth ha-midrash by later genera tions, even from beyond the boundaries of Judaism. The notion of oral Torah is a kind of admission, even a celebration, of this porous nature of the officially recognised Tanakh. For the closing of the canon or the attribution of exclusive authority to it is very difficult to achieve. As Michael Fishbane observes of classical Judaism, The notion of sacrality which adheres to the biblical text by virtue of its source in divinity was gradually protected, qualified, and even extended by hermen eutical systems which re-opened the closed text. This led to paradox after paradox until, remarkably, the very sanctity of biblically derived actions hung by hermeneutical threads of one length or another, and until the very sanctity of the biblical text was itself hermeneutically established. Thus by virtue of its famous myth of the two Torahs—the one written and the other oral, but both given coterminously at Sinai—the Pharisaic sages laid claim to the true chain of interpretation whereby the written Torah was to be historically renewed.3 Now traditional Christian reading shares with the rabbis the sense of scripture as divine speech; but if there is any Christian equivalent to oral Torah, then it is in the form of a distillation or a reduction in credal formulae rather than in the meandering extensions of interpretation. The change has the effect, at least in western Christianity, of giving the sacred text a more isolated and authoritative position than it held even in theory for the rabbis. This can be seen in page design of scriptural commentary from the early twelfth century, when the standard Glossa Ordinaria was developed as 'the definitive reference edition of the [Latin] Bible'.4 In the printed version of 1480, for instance, the canonical text is central and in larger print; but the reader's eye runs between the lines to short explanatory comments and then out to the margins for interpretations by Augustine, Gregory the Great, Isidore and other author ities (Figure 1). So the order of Jacob's procession at the meeting with Esau is explained—literally between the lines—as the moral progression from fear (the maids) through friendship (Leah) to purity (Rachel), while the interpreta tion of Peniel ('face of God') is expanded by a lengthy marginal quotation from Gregory, expounding the visibility and invisibility of God through mystical and incamational theology.5 The readings are less prolix and at the same time more allegorical than the rabbis', with the design reflecting a theology that foregrounds even more than the midrashim the logos of scripture. But again, in the practice of reading it is the commentary—the Fathers and the scholars—that controls and hedges in the sacred text.6 The Gloss was extended in the later middle ages, particularly by the incorporation of the 'postills' of Nicholas of Lyra, as can be seen in the</page><page sequence="4">Jj(Ecnclïo.

The text bears the baggage of the standard introductions by Jerome, the marginal patristic interpretations and the short interlinear comments, but now it also includes verse numbering and has ingenious typographical pointers to Nicholas's fairly rationalistic observations on it in the panel below, as well as to the improving comments headed Moraliter in the panel below that. In this lowest section, for instance, the details of the encounter between the two brothers are the catalyst for teaching on the contrast between pride (Esau) and humility (Jacob, sic). The commentary industry is becoming yet more powerful and all-embracing. This displacement of the canon itself is recognised in a revealing remark of the Douai theologians in their introduction to the 1617 edition of the Gloss. Many generations, they say, thought of this collection of scriptural interpretations so highly that they called it the 'normal tongue' (glossa ordinaria), the very language [or 'tongue', lingua] of Scripture, as it were. When Scripture speaks with it, we understand. But when we read the sacred words without it, we think we hear a language which we do not know.7 It was of course in reaction to just such dependence on tradition that the Protestant Reformation was founded and that the translation of the scriptures into a genuine glossa ordinaria or 'vulgar tongue' was undertaken. Scripture was to be again its own interpreter, speaking more directly to Tyndale's ploughboy than ever to the over-subtle schoolmen. Yet, ironically, Luther and Calvin and Melanchthon spawn forests of biblical interpretation them selves. And many of the new protestant Bibles, while undoubtedly simpler in design and apparatus than the medieval ones, don't entirely trust the parson, let alone the ploughboy, to interpret aright. So the fascinating marginal comments in the famous Geneva Bible (1560 edition, Figures) aim at a straightforward factual explanation of verses that might be unclear; but fre quently their pastoral or disciplinary tone again leaves the text behind. The taut canonical account of Jacob's limping on from Peniel is interrupted in the margin by the comment that 'The faithful so overcome their tentations, that they feele the smart thereof, to the intent that they should not glorie, but in their humilitie'; while when, rather embarrassingly, Jacob bows to his brother, the margin notes that 'Iaakob and his family are the image of the Churche under ye yoke of tyrants, which for feare are brought to subiection'. I move finally to two standard commentaries from different hermeneutical stables of the twentieth century. The first, from the heyday of both historical criticism and so-called 'biblical theology' is The Interpreter's Bible of 1952 (Figure 4). Here there is a clear threefold division between text, exegesis and exposition, with lines actually ruled between the three.

S# So Jacob called the name of the place Pendel," saying, "For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life » That is The face of God But then, at last, he has to reckon with God. He emerges from the conflict physically lamed but spiritually regenerated. Nevertheless, as will be seen, the penalty for his past treatment of Esau has to be paid, and in this section of the tale (33:1-16) the old self centeredness reappears momentarily for a final purging. And it may well be that in the mind of J2 Jacob's suffering at the loss of Joseph was in expiation of the past. Vs. 32, referring to a custom not elsewhere mentioned in the O.T., is a later addition. The significance of the taboo is uncertain. Robertson Smith (Religion of Semites, p. 380) explains it from the idea that the thigh was sacred as the seat of life. Wellhausen (Reste arabischen Heidentums [2nd ed.; Berlin: Georg Reimer, 1897], p. 168) calls attention to a trace of it in ancient Arabia. Vs. 30, as has been noted above, is from E, a fragment of the story which he sub stituted for the J story of the wrestling, shrinking from its stark anthropomorphism. As to whether he drew upon the legend of the founding of the sanctuary at Penuel— of which Peniel is simply another form—it is impossible to say. The site of Penuel has not been identified. All that is known is that it was east of the Jordan, not far from Succoth (cf. 33:17; Judg. 8:5-8). generations even the church has invoked God for the ends of violence. But a truer perception of God breaks through the long record of the Bible. His name becomes "the Holy One of Israel." It is seen that his supreme revelation is not in the awesomeness of nature, but in the heart of man; and that his most essential working is not in what the forces of his universe do to man, but in what his spirit achieves within man. Consider the im mense significance of the ethical insight of the prophets, beginning with Elijah, and their in flexible message that the Holy One of Israel could not be approached with empty rituals but only through righteousness of life. Later it was perceived that even the name "the Holy One of Israel" was not enough. God's holy pur pose was not limited to one people. Read the first chapters of the prophecy of Amos, and see how passionately he makes it clear that all na tions alike must become the instruments of the Holy One, in whose hands are the destinies of all mankind. Hosea and Second Isaiah take an other step in understanding: with them the sternness of Amos is suffused by a new appre ciation of God as redeeming love. And so the O.T. stands at the threshold of the N.T., and over that threshold came Jesus, teaching us to say "Our Father." Which name then interprets God to us? The Lord who is encountered only as the author of the unpredictable emergencies which insurance policies rule out as "acts of God"; the God of the tribe; the God who marches with flags and drums? Or the God of conscience, the God of the growing heart, the God who is seen in the face of him to whom was given "the name which is above every name"? 30. The Encounter with God.—Jacob got no verbal answer to his question. In his demand to know God's name there may have been re flected the primitive belief that to know a name was to have the key word to control (see Expos, on vs. 29). Men have outgrown that idea, but may substitute for it another equally fallacious. Knowledge about God may still seem the impor tant thing; and if some glib theological phrase is learned, we may suppose that we have caught the reality of religion. There is a sense, of course, in which the name of God is decisive for life and hope. Is he fate, or Father? Is he an indifferent force that moves on its blind and cruel way, or can we call upon him as one who has compassion on his children? In that sense to know his name, ultimately revealed as the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, is to have life undergirded by joyful trust. But that sort of knowing does not come through formulas. Jacob could never have got his real answer through a word or phrase. Such may be husks for the intellect, while the soul is left unfed. Jacob had to feel the truth of God—to feel in his own experience an actual contact with the Infinite, to know the awful power of God's holi ness that may have to blast and burn our petty human confidence before it can fully bless. That is why Jacob called the place of his strug gle Peniel, and said that he had seen God face to face. He did not need to be told anything.

But perhaps one could say that the heart is in the middle section, the exegesis, presented in the same type-face as the canonical text. This exegesis purports to be objective and scientific and, in the case of Genesis, is mainly pre-occupied with 'sources'—the respective contributions of J and E, 'the mind of J2', the supposed background to the Jabbok story in ancient taboos about thigh-bones and 'the legend of the founding of the sanctuary at Peniel'.8 Here is the authoritative explanation of the opaque text above. So does the heart rule the head? Or are both in practice overruled by the loins, so to speak—the 'exposition' which comes lower down in smaller print? This is in a more homiletic style, stressing the 'virility' and 'sublimity' of the Genesis narratives and laced with contemporary ethical and political comment and with bons mots from the likes of Browning and Carlyle. It is now extremely dated; but although the editors warn that the exposition must not disown the 'facts' of the exegesis9 it is again hard to resist the sense that this is where the energy and interest lie, at farthest remove from the supposedly authoritat ive text. And although in the progressivist higher-critical atmosphere that pervades The Interpreter's Bible Judaism is seen as a primitive and legalistic lapse from the high point of prophetic revelation, in fact we are seeing here a modern kind of midrash, trailing away from the canonical text that it aims to exalt. The same may be true of the standard modern commentaries written from an evangelical stance and usually entitled 'Study Bibles'. Perhaps 'standard' is misleading, for there is a plethora of such editions. I was able to count no fewer than 27 on the shelves of one bookshop, ranging from such compre hensive volumes as Nelson's Complete Study System NKJV to niche marketing like the Spirit-Filled Life Bible for Students NKJV, NIV Men's Devotional Bible and NIV Parenting Bible. Looking at the presentation of Genesis in a relatively restrained and liberal edition, the NIV Student Bible, one finds an attractive layout: the canonical text still occupies most of most pages, interspersed with fairly factual one-line headings and with more expansive explanations in little boxes. But the greatest emphasis is given to the larger boxes headed Insight that occur every few chapters, with effective and pithy homiletic material in larger print than the actual biblical text. So an 'Insight' box about Jacob headed Con Man in God's Family? faces up to the unpleasantness and trickery of the patriarch: He certainly doesn't seem like choice material for a religious leader ... But God chose Jacob. [This is further interpreted through Paul's theology in Romans 9] ... God has a habit of choosing flawed people to achieve great good. Who can say what he is doing with the hypocrites of our day?10 The box concludes with 'Life Questions' for the student: 'Why do you think God chooses imperfect people like Jacob? Why did he choose you?' But are</page><page sequence="10">CHRISTOPHER BURDON 231 we not again seeing—from the constituency keenest to exalt the unique authority and inspiration of scripture—a lack of faith that the Author of the sacred text can speak for himself, an admission that interpretation is inevitable and that the meaning is in the margin? Whether or not it is enlightening, whether or not it actually displaces the sacred text, the process of commentary is inherently unstoppable. Drawing on both Derrida and Ricoeur, Robert Detweiler has construed biblical inter pretation as 'an excellent example, perhaps the prime example' of the process of language proliferating 'in endless dissemination as a continuous supple ment'. He writes that: Scripture as trace of the absent absolute is constandy supplemented by interpreta tion that does not, contrary to the agendas of 'scientific' approaches, gradually focus on foundational truths, but expands into a huge, excessive body of discourse that provides the illusion (we literary critics would say the fiction) of substance.11 But is the 'substance', whether real or illusory, in the rambling midrashic web or in the text itself? And if it is in the former, what sanctity or authority can stick to the canonical text? I would suggest that the only ways to such a sanctity or authority are, paradoxically, in uses of the canon that sit loose to its uniqueness or authority, refraining from theorising about it and foregoing the search for meaning (or even for meanings). Or rather, recognising and celebrating that if there is 'meaning' then it is neither in the surface of the text nor in the margins nor in some reality behind the text, but instead in the praxis of the reader or reading community. This praxis may be apparently unpractical, like the liturgical repetition or chanting of scriptural texts. In Christian monastic tradition from as early as Cassian this liturgical performance of scripture has spilled over into the corporate or more frequently individual practice of lectio divina. Such a discipline, required by the Rule of St Benedict as one of the daily strands of life in search of God, is distinct from the 'grammatical' study which may nevertheless be a prelude to it; distinct too from the use of the text as a mantra, and more far-reaching than conventional modem 'devotional read ing'. Practitioners frequently describe what happens in such leisurely reading as ruminatio—an activity of lips, mind and heart for which only the sensual vocabulary of taste and digestion seems to suffice. So monastic authors use such vivid and paradoxical phrases as palatum cordis and in ore cordis to express the inward 'tasting' of scripture. Bernard of Clairvaux writes, As food is sweet to the palate, so does a psalm delight the heart. But the soul that is sincere and wise will not fail to chew the psalm with her teeth, as it were, of the mind. Because, if she swallows it in a lump without proper</page><page sequence="11">232 COMMENTARY'S DISPLACEMENT OF CANON mastication, her palate will be cheated of the delicious flavour, sweeter even than honey that drips from the comb.12 Not that all the tasting is simply delightful in this activity which is both reading and praying and yet neither. 'In the monastery,' writes a modern Benedictine, 'the lectio divina, this activity which begins with grammar, terminates in compunction, in desire of heaven'.13 In such 'piercing' reading, commentary is left behind: the authority and inspiration of scripture are not theorised about, nor is full understanding of the text's meaning claimed, nor is an analysis of different 'senses' of scripture undertaken. Yet in terms of the medieval fourfold senses, lectio divina could be described as always 'anagogical' in its emphasis, holding fast to the memorised and internalised text while reaching out from it into the future of the soul and of the cosmos. Something similar might be said about another form of scriptural reading which is apparently far removed from the monastic setting of lectio divina. The reading of the Bible in communities committed to human liberation also involves an anagogical reaching out into action and transformation. This is graphically presented in Carlos Mesters's description of the life of Brazilian basic communities, where again metaphors of taste, digestion and cooking are prominent. Mesters describes a time when he presented stories and teachings from the Bible to a local group and was initially alarmed that in their subsequent discussions and meetings and reports to the priest: ... the Bible disappeared ... Instead they talked about real life and their concrete struggles. Ye gods, I thought to myself, where did I go wrong? This is supposed to be a course on the Bible and all they talk about is real life ... Well, I decided to take it easy and feel satisfied because the Bible had achieved its purpose. Like salt, it had disappeared into the pot and spiced the whole meal.14 This could be fanciful and over-optimistic. But it is supported by the careful balance Mesters persistently advocates between three factors or angles of interpretation. He variously calls these factors 'pre-text, text and context', 'reality, Bible, community', 'life, science, faith'—with a certain priority given to the first factor. The European and North American achievements of 'scientific' exegesis are not disowned; but commentary and literal-historical meaning alone are found wanting in the face of the people's real situation, as they are to a lesser extent in the face of the third factor of the Church's faith. Here Mesters draws an interesting parallel between liberationist and patristic interpretation, picking up and transposing to a more political key the Fathers' distinction between 'letter' and 'spirit'. He picks up too Augustine's influential notion of the 'two books' of God, with scripture as complementary to the first book of creation: indeed, scripture or the 'book of faith' is even seen as a kind of subsidiary commentary on the 'book of</page><page sequence="12">CHRISTOPHER BURDON 233 life'.15 So, unlike the fundamentalist churches also active in Latin America, the basic communities can be fairly relaxed about the actual authority and status of the text. They can—at a certain risk of subjectivism or ideology, which Mesters recognises—effectively by-pass the traditional task of com mentary in the concern for orthopraxis rather than orthodoxy. Readings of scripture such as those of basic communities or lectio divina do not of course make commentary illegitimate—not that interpreters would take much notice even if such a conclusion were reached. But they might help dispel some illusions about the possibility of a discrete authoritative text. Sacred text, exegesis, exposition and praxis can no longer be presented in an hierarchical order, descending the page or moving out from the centre— which makes our work as interpreters more confusing, more humbling, and infinitely more exciting. 9 Boswells Drive, Chelmsford, Essex CM2 6LD, UK REFERENCES G.G.
