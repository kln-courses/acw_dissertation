<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Ryder Yuri K. Melvil and American Pragmatism 1. Introductory Remarks Yuri Konstantinovich Melvil (1912-1993) was one of the most prominent figures in Soviet philosophy from the early years of the cold war to the end of the Soviet period. As a leading specialist in Western , especially American, philosophy, he played an important role not only in the study of the history of American philosophy in the Soviet Union, but also as a key ideologist in what during the cold war was regarded as an intellectual battle with Western, bourgeois, philosophy. He spent his entire career in the Department of Foreign Philosophy, in the Faculty of Philosophy at Moscow State University, where for many years he was the department chair. Moscow State University was, and remains, the flagship university in the Soviet Union and now Russia, and the Department of Foreign Philosophy was one of the most important centers in the country for the study of the history of philosophy and contemporary Western thought. From his position in that department, Melvil was a central figure in all of So viet philosophical education. He published extensively throughout his career, and as a teacher he influenced probably thousands of stu dents who took up positions as teachers of philosophy throughout the country. Though he was a specialist is Western philosophy in gen eral, and he wrote quite a bit on modern European thought both for publication and as text material for students in his department, Melvil's primary impact was in the area of the history of American philosophy. For well over thirty years, he was the "Dean" of Soviet studies of the history of American philosophy, and his influence on the scholars Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society Fall, 1996, Vol. XXXII, No. 4</page><page sequence="2">599 John Ryder who came after him, such as N. S. Yulina and A. M. Karimsky, is immeasurable. This point is significant, particularly for those who are interested in the history of American philosophy, because Soviet studies in that field constitute by far the largest, most extensive body of foreign lit erature devoted to American thought. No other society, at no other time, has been as interested in American philosophy as were the Sovi ets, and as some Russian specialists continue to be. In fact for some time, in the 1970s and the 1980s at least, one of the best places in the world to do graduate study that focused on the history of American philosophy was Moscow State University! With one or two possible exceptions, no Ph.D. granting philosophy department in the United States had as many specialists in the history of American philosophy as Moscow. The scholars who worked at Moscow during those years, some of whom are still there, have produced a significant body of commentary on all areas of the history of American philosophy, from Puritanism to contemporary naturalism and neo-pragmatism. Of course there have been and continue to be specialists in American philosophy outside of Moscow State University, some in the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences, and some in many other universities across the country. All of them, to one degree or another, are indebted to the work of Yuri K. Melvil. While Soviet studies dealt with the entire history of American thought, MelviPs specialty was American pragmatism, about which he wrote throughout his career. His first book on pragmatism, titled simply American Pragmatism, appeared in 1957, and the last two papers he wrote before he died in 1993 were on William James. In between, he turned to the subject of pragmatist philosophy over and over again, continually rethinking his understanding of pragmatism's central concepts, especially its approach to thought, experience, real ity and truth. In 1967 Melvil published what was at the time and what remains the most significant study of the whole of C. S. Peirce's thought by a Russian philosopher, Charles Peirce and Pragmatism. In what follows I will offer a brief overview of Melvil's critical approach to pragmatism, and of the development of his ideas over</page><page sequence="3">Turi . Melvil and American Pragmatism 600 the course of his career. In some respects he remained critical of prag matism throughout his life, though in other ways the character of his commentaries changed quite radically from the first studies in the 1950s to the Peirce book to the last thoughts on James. Those changes are due to a range of factors. Through nearly forty years, one would expect a person's ideas to change, and Melvil is no exception. In his case, though, broader social and political factors were also at work. In the mid-1950s the Soviet Union was locked in a serious, in fact life or death, struggle with the United States, and Soviet commentary on American thought naturally reflected that fact. By the end of Melvil's life, the Soviet Union no longer existed, and the ideological and po litical concerns that were so prominent decades before had all but disappeared. Melvil's later work, again quite naturally, continued to reflect the changing social environment. While the differences be tween the earliest and the latest work are striking, the changes did not occur abrupdy. Melvil's approach to American pragmatism evolved over time, and it is that evolution that I would like to demonstrate in these remarks. Though Melvil's thought changed from the early to the later work, the fact is that all of his philosophic commentary was under taken in the context of the defense of Marxist thought in relation to Western philosophy, especially though not exclusively American. This can have both an ideological and a more technically philosophical dimension, and Melvil's writings had both. The ideological dimen sion was most pronounced in the early work, where Melvil criticized pragmatism on the grounds that it represented bourgeois and impe rialist interests, and was thus morally objectionable. Such ideological considerations tended to diminish over time, and to disappear en tirely by the end, but Melvil's philosophic misgivings about pragma tism remained as strong in his last papers as they were earlier. He would repeatedly criticize pragmatism, where he found it inadequate, for being a form of idealism, or of collapsing into irrationalism. To understand that such claims were for him drastic criticisms, it is nec essary to bear in mind aspects of the historical and dialectical materi alist ideas that Melvil took as givens. Before surveying his treatment</page><page sequence="4">601 John Ryder of American thought, in particular pragmatism, we need to review quickly some of the basic traits of Marxist philosophy which were taken for granted in the Soviet philosophical world. 2. Dialectical and Historical Materialism Following Engels and Lenin, Soviet philosophers distinguished between dialectical and historical materialism. The latter dealt with the theories of politics, history, economics, and with social reality in general. The former concerned nature and knowledge, and consti tuted Marxist conceptions in metaphysics, epistemology, and branched into logic and axiology. With respect to the latter set of topics, Soviet Marxists endorsed a materialist ontology, though it was a materialism quite different from the more familiar western European materialisms. Marxist materialism, most importantly, tends not to be reductionist, unlike many other varieties. To endorse a materialist ontology for a Marxist is not necessarily to claim that all that exists is matter in mo tion, or that all knowledge can be articulated in the language of the natural sciences, or even that all seemingly mental events are in fact nothing other than physical or neurophysiological events. More posi tively put, dialectical materialism consists of the view that matter is the foundation of whatever there is in the sense that whatever there is develops from material processes, and that material processes are not necessarily dependent on mind or spirit. I say "not necessarily" be cause the dialectical materialist need not deny that mind can influ ence matter. He need only deny that matter requires mind to exist. Another way to put the point is that matter, or material entities, have traits independently of mind or spirit, and are in that sense and to that extent objective. Dialectical materialism, then, endorses a view that is much out of fashion in the contemporary philosophical world, that is an objectivism and a foundationalism. Matter is foundational in relation to whatever else there may be, and it possesses at least some of its properties independently of any non-material entities. There is of course more to the dialectical materialist point of view. In fact the foundationalism and objectivism describes only the "materialist" half of dialectical materialism. The "dialectical" side</page><page sequence="5">Turi . Melvil and American Pragmatism 602 consists of the view that material objects are characterized by dialec tical properties and processes. Most significantly, Soviet dialectical materialists, and many others, have argued following a general Hegelianism that material entities consist of contradictory traits in the sense that a material object will invariably have characteristics inclining it in different directions, so to speak. A piece of paper, for example, is characterized by processes that are holding it together, and simultaneously by processes that are pulling it apart. The future traits of a given material object, on this view, are a result of the way such tensions are resolved. In other words, material development is the result of the dialectical process of the resolution of the contradic tory traits that constitute a given material object. However, as impor tant as this view has been to many Marxists, the materialist aspect of Marxism has been more relevant to Soviet treatments of American philosophy, including Melvil's. In virtually all dialectical materialist writings, the foundationalist and materialist ontology is accompanied by an epistemology that is equally out of fashion in much of the contemporary philosophical world. Dialectical materialist epistemology tended to consist of the view that knowledge is the reflection in consciousness of the objective world. This includes a correspondence theory of truth, so that an idea is true ifit corresponds with, which is to say that it accurately reflects, the objective world. Dialectical materialism of this sort is very much a modernist enterprise, though of course it is more complex and so phisticated than simply this. For example, though dialectical material ists have tended to accept the view that mind or consciousness reflects objective reality, and that ideas are just those reflections, they have not accepted the more common forms of either rationalist or empiri cist epistemology. Reason on this view is sterile if it is exercised inde pendentiy of experience and practice, and experience is meaningless independent of general ideas and theory in which that experience is embedded. As a result of these modifications of modernist epistemol ogy, dialectical materialists have avoided many of the positivistic ten dencies of twentieth century European philosophy, as well as its more rationalist moments. In fact, in this respect Soviet dialectical material</page><page sequence="6">603 John Ryder ism had a fair bit in common with both the pragmatist and naturalist strains of American thought. Like naturalists, Soviet philosophers would take the material world seriously, and like the pragmatists, they would insist that practice and action are necessary components of philosophical understanding. Despite the similarities, though, we will see that there were more comprehensive differences from the Soviet point of view, in particular with pragmatism. The historical materialist aspect of Marxist philosophy also had a strong impact on Soviet thinking and on MelviPs assessment of Ameri can pragmatism. The short version of the relevant aspects of histori cal materialism is that the forces and the relations of production of a society, that is its economic base, invariably condition the social rela tions and the dominant ideas of that society. A feudal mode of pro duction, therefore, which means a certain level of agricultural tech nology accompanied by typically feudal relations of production be tween nobility and peasantry, will require social and political rela tions appropriate to it. More to our purposes, it will require ideas, whether of politics, religion, philosophy, or ethics, that are consistent with the mode of production. Precisely the same claim is to be made about a capitalist mode of production, and we should expect that as society undergoes the transformation between a feudal and a bour geois mode of production, the entire set of social relations and domi nant ideas will be transformed as well. To lend some credence to this point of view, one might point out that this is exactly what happened in European society and thought through the Renaissance and well into the modern period. A further refinement of the claim about the relation of the eco nomic base to the social and ideational superstructure is necessary. The social structures and the dominant ideas of a society must be consistent with the prevailing mode of production precisely in the sense that they must embody and reflect the material interests of the ruling class in that mode of production. The social structures and the dominant ideas during the European medieval period, then, were consistent not with feudalism in general, but more specifically with the interests of the feudal nobility. The political arrangements that</page><page sequence="7">Yuri . Melvil and American Pragmatism 604 prevailed, for example, served the nobility's interests in that political power was rooted in the feudal estates, which were under the control of the nobility. Similarly, the dominant religious ideas of the period served the nobility's interest in that the hierarchical Christianity that was espoused could be appealed to as a divine justification of the hierarchical economic and social arrangements of feudal society in which the nobility dominated. Comparable claims could be made about capitalist society. There too the prevailing social structures and the dominant ideas can be expected to reflect the interests of those who control the characteris tic forms of property and production. The most obvious example is that as the capitalist mode of production gradually came into its own beginning with the Renaissance, private control of property, not sim ply in land but in commercial and financial property, became increas ingly important. Eventually, political structures developed that were designed to help the bourgeoisie protect their property interests, and the notion of a "right" to property became enshrined in political and ethical theory. The historical materialist point here is neither a simple nor a mechanical one. The claim is not that only certain ideas can emerge in a given society. Such a claim would obviously be false. Rather, the idea is that only certain ideas can be expected to be dominant in a society, and those are the ideas that reflect and protect the interests of the ruling dominant class. The concept of a right to property could not have dominated in feudal society, anymore than the concept of workers' ownership of the means of production could dominate in capitalist society. The implications of this thesis for a historian of philosophy are extensive. First, no Marxist historian of philosophy will treat ideas as if they can be wholly divorced from the context in which they occur. It will be taken for granted that in some way, though it has always been notoriously difficult to specify precisely how, ideas that come to the fore in a given time and place will reflect something about that time and place. It may be that they will represent a reaction against some feature or other of the dominant economic, social or intellec</page><page sequence="8">605 John Ryder tuai characteristics of the society. One might even say, for example, that the remarkably frequent emphasis on community in American philosophy of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is a reaction against the extreme individualism that has dominated American ide ology. Second, even though some ideas may be an alternative to the dominant traits of a society, those ideas that come to prevail in or to dominate a society's intellectual life are likely to be ideas that reflect the interests of those who control the means of production. This general theoretical perspective is evident in Melvil's studies of Ameri can pragmatism, especially during his initial work in the 1950s. Prag matism in the first half of the twentieth century in America was nearly an official philosophy, or so one might be tempted to think. The influence of John Dewey was so extensive that one could say that his instrumentalist version of pragmatism counted as a dominant philo sophical perspective. On historical materialist theory, then, pragma tism is likely to embody in some relevant ways bourgeois values and interests. If one regards bourgeois values and interests as inimical to freedom and human development in the present historical period, as Melvil did, then pragmatism, as the expression of those values and interests, will be criticized accordingly. This is precisely what we find in Melvil's earliest writings on American philosophy and pragmatism. 3. The Ideological Battle With Pragmatism Melvil's first important and influential studies of pragmatism came in 1957, with the publication of his American Pragmatism and a fairly long article titled "Pragmatism - The Philosophy of Subjective Idealism," in an anthology called Contemporary Subjective Idealism. The latter piece is essentially a restatement of the analysis of Dewey from American Pragmatism, so we can gain a sense of the flavor and content of Melvil's criticism of pragmatism from an overview mainly of the book. In American Pragmatism Melvil weaves together a technical cri tique of pragmatism in Peirce, James and Dewey, with an ideological analysis of pragmatism as an expression of bourgeois society. I em phasize both strains of Melvil's approach because the changing rela</page><page sequence="9">Yuri . Melvil and American Pragmatism 606 tion between the two, above everything else, is what characterizes the development of Melvil's views over the course of his career. In these early works the ideological component is as strong as the tech nical. In the middle period, particularly with the book on Peirce in 1968, the technical misgivings remain strong, but the ideological concerns nearly disappear. By the last years of his life, Melvil remains concerned about aspects of pragmatist epistemology, metaphysics and approach to science, but his criticisms are far less harsh, less strident, and certainly less confident. We see, I think, the effects of a changing international environment from the 1950s to the 1990s, a changing environment within the Soviet Union, as well as the patience and tolerance of other ideas that often come with maturity and age. In the 1950s, though, Melvil took his place in the intellectual struggle against bourgeois society and ideology. A critical compo nent of that struggle was the repudiation of pragmatism which, though as Melvil points out had had its adherents all over the world, had become especially influential in the United States. It had become, he said, "almost the official philosophy of the American imperialist bour geoisie," and indeed "one of the most reactionary currents of bour geois philosophy in the epoch of imperialism" (1957a, 5). Pragma tism, in so far as it opposes philosophical and natural scientific mate rialism, cannot be a suitable philosophy for progressive human inter ests, and so is inherently anti-democratic. From Melvil's point of view, "Exposing its reactionary content is one of the conditions of a suc cessful struggle for the victory of the scientific world view" (1957a, 6). Melvil, and he represents the mood of his colleagues in this pe riod, was engaged not simply in philosophical inquiry but in an ideo logical batde that was a critical component of a world historic struggle. The ideological component of Melvil's analysis is probably the most striking, so we should deal with it first. Pragmatism arose, Melvil said, in the period of the transition from "free capitalism" to imperi alism. This is also the period, the late 19th century, that saw the Paris Commune, the development of working class consciousness and the rise of Marxism, and a variety of other ideas and social movements that undermined the confidence of the bourgeoisie in the more or</page><page sequence="10">607 John Ryder less smooth progress and evolution of bourgeois society. One of the results of this general situation on the ideological level is that we be gan to see a movement away from the confident rationalism and trust in scientific inquiry of the Enlightenment to forms of irrationalism and voluntarism. If the world is not as stable and predictable as we thought, then we will turn that instability into a world view that can be put to our service, so to speak. Thus we see in Germany the influ ence of Nietzsche, in France Bergson, and in America the pragmatists. In Peirce, Melvil suggested, we find essentially the subjective ide alism of Berkeley adapted to the utilitarianism and pragmatism of American businessmen and entrepreneurs (1957a, 11 ). In James' plu ralistic universe and his radical empiricism, we find "an unusually strik ing example of the decay and collapse of bourgeois thought." James' pluralistic universe, he said, may be likened to capitalist society as it appears to bourgeois consciousness: its splintered interests, its anar chy and crises, its supposedly chance production of events, and its failure to recognize the laws of social development (1957a, 54-55). Dewey, for whom Melvil saved his most angry remarks, and to whom he never seemed to warm, unlike Peirce and James, "is one of the most negative figures of the ideological reaction of the epoch of im perialism. For more than sixty years he poisoned the consciousness of the American people with his reactionary ideas...Instrumentalism," he continued, "means an irrevocable rejection of knowledge of exter nal reality and the advocacy of a complete relativism, irrationalism and agnosticism." And finally, "Dewey's Instrumentalism expresses the union of idealistic philosophy with the reactionary politics of the imperialist bourgeoisie, transforming philosophy into an ideological instrument of monopoly capital" (1957a, 61-64). What were the technical points of dispute that underlay the ideo logical critique? One of the most serious issues, and one that Melvil emphasizes again and again, is that pragmatism, beginning with Peirce's "Fixation of Belief," represents knowledge not as a process of the reflection in human consciousness of objective reality but as a purely psychological, and he adds subjective, process. Peirce, he says, speaks of "true" and "false" as if he means them in their standard</page><page sequence="11">Turi . Melvil and American Pragmatism 608 senses, but in fact for Peirce the value of thought or inquiry is the establishment of belief regardless of its truth or falsity in the standard senses of those terms. This is why Melvil sees knowledge in Peirce's terms as largely a psychological and subjective process: an adequate or true idea is one that satisfies our hopes and desires. There is a sense, he says, in which Peirce is right that the process of inquiry has these and other psychological traits, but they are not, he insists, the essence of knowledge. On the contrary, the essence of knowledge is that consciousness reflects objective reality. The relation between such reflection and practical activity is that what Peirce calls "belief is only functional or an adequate guide to behavior if it is a relatively faithful reflection of reality. Melvil felt that Peirce had some sense of this, which is why he went to such pains in the "Fixation of Belief to contrast those ways of establishing belief that he thought inappropriate with the one way that he thought was adequate. Melvil argued, however, that Peirce ran up against the very narrow limits of pragmatism at this point. If the goal of knowledge is to establish belief, Melvil said, then it would appear that any way or method of meeting this goal would be suit able. Though Peirce opposes the method of tenacity, for example, he really has no way of refuting it. Peirce argued that it cannot work over time, but if the purpose of inquiry is to establish belief, then ifit is possible for some people to organize their lives around dogmati cally held ideas all evidence to the contrary be damned, as we see so many people able to do, doing so would seem to meet Peirce's defi nition. The same point is made in response to the method of author ity and the "a priori" method. Pragmatism inherently involved a plu ralist, subjectivist and relativist world view, Melvil said. The fact that Peirce wanted to contrast the method of science with the other three as ways of establishing belief does not alter the critical assessment as far as Melvil was concerned. Not only does it not constitute a response to Melvil's objection, but Peirce's appeal to science indicates he thought something typical of pragmatism: "While hypocritically endorsing the 'method of science,' contrasting it with the other three, as the only method consistent with the facts, Peirce</page><page sequence="12">609 John Ryder at the same time abolishes the foundation on which science and the scientific method are based" (1957a, 18). Melvil means here that only if we take the view that there is an objectively determinate world does the method of science have any power, but it is just this view that Peirce's pragmatism rejects, or at least avoids. For Peirce, Melvil said, the objective world is simply a convenient hypothesis, suitable as one method of fixing belief. In that case, though, Peirce's "method of science" is not distinguishable from any of the other methods, except in that in this or that case it may prove to be more successful, but then so may any of the others, in this or that particular case. With this objection Melvil introduces the other major materialist criticism of pragmatism, namely that it does not adequately acknowl edge the objectivity of the world. As Berkeley dissolved things into perceptions, Peirce defines a "thing" in terms of its effects, and thereby reduces things to their practical consequences. This is both an episte mologica! and an ontological relativism, Melvil argued. It is an en dorsement of relativism in knowledge in that a thing is identified differently in relation to its use at a given moment, and if to be is to have practical consequences then something exists in so far as it touches our interests, and in that consists its meaning for us. It is important to note that for Melvil this is not a criticism of Peirce's intentions. Peirce, he said, did not see these implications of his own ideas. He never wished to abandon what he took to be the scientific view, and he was thus appalled at the direction in which others took his ideas (1957a, 21-22). As the last remark suggests, Melvil found just the same short comings in James. There are some features of James' ideas that would be immediate and fairly obvious candidates for Melvil's criticism. His interest in religious thought and the justification of the reasonable ness of religious ideas as a goal of James' view of rationality would be obvious problems for a materialist, and Melvil also objected to James' emphasis on individual temperament in his remark about what in clines philosophers to this or that point of view. This Melvil found to be highly subjectivist, and a failure to recognize the socially deter mined nature of consciousness. These points notwithstanding, Melvil's</page><page sequence="13">Yuri . Melvil and American Pragmatism 610 most sustained criticism dealt with James' concepts of truth and the pluralistic universe. In what Melvil describes as a clear application of Peirce's prin ciple of pragmatic meaning, James held that if two contradictory views have no differing practical consequences for us then they are not dif ferent. Truth, by implication, has no meaning outside of its relation to us, more specifically outside of its consequences for us. Ideas, then, are not copies of an objective reality but tools or plans of action. Truth consists in the process of the verification of an idea. If an idea serves the function to which we wish to put it, it is to that extent true, and truth means nothing more than that. This view of truth is false, Melvil thinks, and in fact it "is refuted at every step by the facts of ordinary life" (1957a, 39). There are many things we believe to be the case, for example, he says, that London is on the Thames, without there being any practical signifi cance to it for most of us most of the time. Similarly, Pierre and Madame Curie discovered radioactivity, and people accepted its truth without knowing any use of it for them. These points suggest that there must be something more to truth than simply usefulness, though usefulness certainly plays a role. Materialism, he points out, has al ways recognized the significance of use in relation to knowledge and truth, but materialists, and he mentions here Holbach and Diderot, have also warned against identifying use with truth. What is useful for some, for example religion in the case of the French concerns with their 18th century society, can be harmful for others. Holbach and Diderot recognized that the identification of usefulness with truth can serve reactionary purposes, and Melvil saw the same ends served by James' concept of truth. Success, he says, is the fundamental prin ciple of pragmatism, in that "Success determines the ends, criteria and the substance of any activity and any idea" (1957a, 42). In Ameri can life the emphasis on success is expressed in the pursuit of profit, in philosophy it is expressed in the very definition of truth itself. James abandons objectivity in his radical empiricism and even more seriously in his ontological pluralism. Radical empiricism ex presses James' idealism, he says, by regarding experience as the "stuff,"</page><page sequence="14">611 John Ryder so to speak, of which subject and object are made. This in turn indi cates the voluntaristic nature of pragmatism because by implication "The volitional nature of man is for pragmatism the foundation of reality" (1957a, 48). It is, however, James' idea of a pluralistic uni verse that Melvil found the most disturbing. Ontologically, it is re lated to radical empiricism in that objects are not given in experience, but each is an individual construct not related, presumably, by objec tively determinate laws to the others. As for epistemology, since there is no unity or necessity in the world, it is possible to explain events in various ways, even if they contradict one another. One can posit any hypothesis or belief that is convenient, or that works. "James' plural ism and radical empiricism," Melvil said, "are acutely hostile to sci ence and the scientific understanding of the world," by denying ob jectively determinate lawful processes in nature as well as the possibil ity of our knowledge of them (1957a, 56). The situation did not improve in Dewey's hands, and in fact Melvil made many of the same critical points about Dewey as he had about James: "Instrumentalism means that all scientific knowledge and theo ries, all ethical principles and moral norms, all social institutions and establishments are no more than instruments for the realization of a specific end," which in turn "means an irrevocable rejection of knowl edge of external reality and the advocacy of a complete relativism, irrationalism and agnosticism" (1957a, 63-64). Like James, too, Dewey tried to develop what he took to be a "third line" in philoso phy, avoiding both materialism and idealism, but like James he also failed, and for a similar reason. They both obscured the difference between subject and object by regarding both as aspects of experi ence, in Dewey's case placing a strong emphasis on the relation be tween the knower and the known. "Of course a thing can not be known apart from a relation to a knowing subject," Melvil says, "[b]ut it can and does exist independently of a subject, whether known or not. Dewey replaces the question of the essence of a thing with the question of its knowledge. This means that Dewey refuses to recog nize the existence of objective reality external to man, and thus his 'third line' is merely a disguised advocacy of subjective idealism"</page><page sequence="15">Yuri . Melvil and American Pragmatism 612 (1957a, 66). Melvil acknowledged that there are many aspects of Dewey's thought that have been compared to Marxism, but he invariably found these comparisons to be inappropriate. For example, Dewey like Marx rejected the concept of the knower as passive, merely reflecting the world in his consciousness, positing instead a concept of the human being as an active agent in the construction and reconstruction of his world. The comparison with Marx on this point is mistaken, and "This mistake indicates how cleverly Dewey imitated science, and how he was able to use well known scientific materialist principles in order to invest in them an idealistic, reactionary content" (1957a, 68). Marx, he explains, understood "practice" as man's active influ ence on objective reality, as the creative activity of people leading to the transformation of material reality, nature and society. Such a trans formation on the Marxist view is accomplished in correspondence with the objective laws of that reality. Practice, then, by placing the human being in direct relation to material reality, is a criterion of the truth of his ideas. Dewey's view is quite different, and Melvil thought inferior. Dewey makes use of the fact that conscious human transfor mation of material reality requires the effort of physical and spiritual strength, as Melvil puts it, but Dewey "absolutizes" this feature of human practical activity. He emphasizes the role of the will, while not seeing that activity is directed at a material object, and that it is sub ordinate to objective laws. Again like James, Dewey says that he does not reject the existence of an external world, though he also says that, in Melvil's words, "inquiry produces an existential transformation and reconstruction of matter" in the resolution of problematic situa tions. The traits of the situation seem always to be determined in relation to a human constituent. Dewey says that we encounter a "coarse reality" out of which these situations are created. But does this "coarse reality" exist objectively or not? Dewey seems to say, Melvil thought, that it exists only in a specific interaction, or situa tion, in which it arises. This means that outside experience there is nothing, and that is subjective idealism. The instrumentalist approach to logic, ethics and social theory all</page><page sequence="16">613 John Ryder participate in the same shortcomings, Melvil argued. With respect to inquiry, Dewey replaces knowledge as reflection with a concept of knowledge as adaptation to the environment. Reason, Dewey held, helps us to change the world, and is itself developed in the process of that change. Melvil points out that here again Dewey seems to be asserting a principle with which a dialectical materialist would agree, but in the long run Dewey cannot sustain this position. It is a prin ciple of science going back to Bacon, Melvil said, that in order to influence and change nature systematically one must know its objec tive laws. But in denying that knowledge involves a grasp of the objec tive laws of nature, Dewey's logic renders the adaptation he endorses impossible, at least in any sustained way. A related point is that in his interpretation of science Dewey employs the undeniable fact that sci ence has its applied side, but in so doing, Melvil argues, he absolutizes the utilitarian side of science, and tries to dismiss the question of ob jective knowledge and truth. This in turn means that Dewey's instru mentalism must reject the possibility of theory (1957a, 76-77). That Dewey's epistemology and ontology make it impossible for instrumentalism to handle the nature and role of theory affects Dewey's ethics and his social thought. Though Dewey rejected tradi tional ahistorical approaches to ethics, something Melvil found con genial, he nonetheless had no recourse but to a situation ethics, which on Melvil's view is a retreat into ethical relativism. Dewey attempted to avoid the relativism by distinguishing between, for example, some thing being found "satisfying" and its being in fact "satisfactory." But again, his own instrumentalist principles do not allow him to bring this distinction off, since in the end pragmatism has no crite rion of morality other than what satisfies in a particular situation (1957a, 86-87). Melvil found Dewey's social theory extremely inadequate. We should not, he thought, be fooled by the fact that Dewey often re ferred to himself as a socialist, and that he spoke of the faults of capi talism and the necessity of social development. The fact was that while Dewey could not help but speak about the problems and contradic tions of capitalism, as stark as they were, he never acknowledged the</page><page sequence="17">Yuri . Melvil and American Pragmatism 614 contradictions that are in fact crucial to the trajectory of social move ment. Dewey "distorted" the very social contradictions he examined, Melvil argued, by regarding them to be primarily a problem between science and technology on the one hand and moral ideals on the other. Dewey missed, in other words, the exploitation of labor, which is the basis of social conflict. Thus while Dewey appears to be progressive, his views in fact serve to obscure the class struggle and thus help to impede social progress. In fact, Melvil argued, on instrumentalist terms the idea of social progress cannot make much sense, since if each situ ation has its own resolution, there can be no general scientific under standing of social development (1957a, 105-106). Melvil's assessment of pragmatism at this stage in his career is summed up nicely in the conclusion of his book: The rejection of the objective reality of the external world and its lawfulness; the rejection of objective truth; the at tempts to eliminate scientific knowledge as the reflection of objective reality and to transform it into a method of finding the means for the satisfaction of subjective ends and the achievement of success; the reduction of reason to a func tion of biological adaptation and response ? all of these traits of subjective idealism, irrationalism and voluntarism characterize pragmatism in our day, as in the time of Peirce and James. (1957a, 118) 4. Peirce and Pragmatism Reconsidered I would remind the reader that the distinctions being made here among three stages of Melvil's philosophical career are rather arbi trary in the sense that they are not determined by any specific or overt events in Melvil's life. They indicate merely one way of appreci ating the development of his ideas and his critical assessment of Ameri can philosophy. If the first stage of his development was the most intensely political, the second was one in which Melvil was more con cerned with the philosophical traits of his subject matter than with an ideological critique. It would be a mistake, though, to exaggerate</page><page sequence="18">615 John Ryder this point. I do not want to give the impression that in this second period Melvil was no longer concerned with the social context of American thought, since that would not be true. Melvil in his second period was no less an historical materialist than in his first, and he was no less committed to Marxist principles and aspirations. The differ ence is simply that the ideological battle he was fighting in the earlier work had subsided, which in turn allowed Melvil to develop a deeper appreciation for some of the figures and movements in American thought that he studied, an appreciation which then made his critical analyses that much more interesting. We can date the second period of his work from the early 1960s until well into the 1980s. He published a good deal during this pe riod of more than twenty years, including books and articles on a range of figures in American and European philosophy of the late 19th and 20th centuries, including by the 1980s some commentary on the neopragmatism of Richard Rorty. The most outstanding mo ment of this period of his work, and in my opinion of his entire ca reer, was his 1968 book on Peirce, Charles Peirce and Pragmatism. The book had actually been written in 1963 as Melvil's doctoral dis sertation, but was not published until 1968. In fact, readers of the Transactions of the C. S. Peirce Society with good long term memories may recall an article Melvil published in Vol. II of the journal, 1966, which he titled "The Conflict of Science and Religion in Charles Peirce's Philosophy." (We should note also a response by Philip Weiner in Vol. III.) This article emphasizes several of the themes of the book, though the book would not be published for two more years. In any case, the fact that he wrote the book several years before it was pub lished is what inclines me to date this period of his work from the early 1960s. A sense of the direction of Melvil's thought in this entire period can be gleaned from a look at some of the highlights of the Peirce book. As we will see, Melvil had by this time developed a somewhat greater appreciation of Peirce, but not so of James and Dewey. Peirce's logical works, he said, made him incomparably greater in comparison with the irrationalism of James, and in his scientific erudition and</page><page sequence="19">Yuri . Melvil and American Pragmatism 616 competence he stood far above Dewey who, he says, in his knowl edge of the natural sciences and the practice of scientific research, not to mention mathematics, barely reached the level of a dilettante! By contrast, "Peirce is a genuinely outstanding moment in bourgeois philosophy" (1968, 15). The fundamental interpretive point Melvil wanted to make in his book, however, is that despite his brilliance, Peirce was "one of the most contradictory of philosophical writers." He notes that this has been pointed out by American commentators, he mentions specifically Wiener, Nagel and Murphey, but they had attributed the contradictions to the continuous development of Peirce's ideas. Melvil contends, though, that the contradictions ap pear in any given period of his work. Actually others have noticed what Melvil calls the" bifurcations" in Peirce's thought, for example between his empiricism and his non-empiricist metaphysics, or a natu ralism and a transcendentalism, but, he says, they have not discov ered their deeper source. The crucial point, Melvil claimed, concerns Peirce's treatment of the relation between religion and science. From Melvil's point of view, and on this point he was following many other Soviet Marxists who were themselves following Engels, the most fundamental philo sophical dispute is between idealism and materialism: is the material world a product of spirit or consciousness, or is spirit and conscious ness a product of the material world? In the late nineteenth century, he says, this dispute took the form of the struggle between science and religion, where in practice scientific inquiry and knowledge rep resented the materialist point of view ( even if many scientists would not have so identified themselves!), while religion embodied ideal ism. Peirce could not avoid this issue, and he dealt with it by coming down squarely on both sides. On the one hand he was committed to the scientific world view, but at the same time, as Melvil put it, he was convinced that reality reflects God's creative power, that all knowl edge is "knowledge of divine truth," and "he went even further than James" in his view that social life and morality require not only belief in God but a universal church (1968, 34-35). As far as Melvil was concerned, this is an impossible position to</page><page sequence="20">617 John Ryder maintain. Materialism and idealism are inimical to one another, and in the end so are science and religion. Any attempt to reconcile them is either ultimately inconsistent, or does violence to one by leaning too far toward the other. Peirce tended toward the latter by trying to understand science through a philosophical idealism, and this is why Melvil says of him that "despite significant achievements in logic and semiotics...Peirce nevertheless frequently betrayed both science and the scientific method" (1968,40). In fact, Peirce's inability to break with religion and idealism in the interest of science was the funda mental problem with his philosophy : "In this, in my view, lies the fundamental contradiction permeating all of Peirce's studies, in this is his tragedy as a scholar, in this is the underlying reason for the fragmentation, incompleteness and internal discontinuity of his work" (1968,41). For many students of Peirce's work, one of his great achieve ments was his pragmatism; for Melvil it was one of his greatest mis takes. The problem appears directly in Peirce's approach to science. On the one hand he rejected the more descriptive view of science that appears in James and in the positivists, holding instead that sci ence is the search for causes, and that the scientific process requires freedom of inquiry, a non-dogmatic search for the truth. This was Peirce's objective side, and in this respect his understanding of sci ence was "fuller and more profound than that of many bourgeois theoreticians of science of his time" (1968, 59). On the other hand, Peirce also had a conception of science in which it is understood primarily in terms of the motives of the scientist, or simply as a pos sible "form of life." This was a shift toward relativism and idealism, he thought, in that the definition leaves out the relation of the pro cess of scientific inquiry to its object, the objective world. That Melvil saw this as a pragmatist feature of Peirce's work is clear when he says further that this relativizing tendency received its most overt expres sion in Dewey's conception of science as problem solving (1968, 60 61). The source of much of Peirce's thought, Melvil argued, was his rejection of the rationalist and empiricist versions of the immediacy of</page><page sequence="21">Turi . Melvil and American Pragmatism 618 knowledge, which in turn led to his pragmatism, his semiotics, and ultimately to his metaphysics. Melvil notes with approval the fact that Peirce would not follow Descartes in his subjectivism, nor in his view that the self has direct, rational access to reality. All knowledge, on the contrary, is derived through reasoning from prior knowledge, and fur thermore we cannot think without signs. Peirce's approach to empiri cal knowledge was similar in that we have no more direct access to reality through empirical experience than we do through reason. Melvil thought that Peirce was quite right to insist that both reason and sensation are more complex than the rationalists and the empiricists had thought, but he worries that in developing his alternative Peirce lost the connection with the world that the traditional theories main tained. With respect to reason, Melvil says that "the process of the interpretation of signs, as Peirce expresses it, is a purely logical pro cess, which never comes in contact with experience, which has no entr?e to objective reality." Similarly for sensory experience: "The re jection of the intuitive character of sensation for Peirce is equivalent to a rejection of the conditionality of sensation by its object external to consciousness; in other words it is equivalent to a rejection of the materialist understanding of the relation of sensation to its object" (1968, 92, 97). It is not that Peirce wanted to deny the reality of an objective world; his scientific side would never allow that. But his own theoretical analysis pushed him to a position wherein the place of the world in the process of inquiry disappears, and what is left is the em phasis on the process itself. This is why Peirce would define reality in terms of what the process of inquiry produces, i.e. what the commu nity of inquirers would agree to, and it is also the source of pragmatism's emphasis on the process over the objects of inquiry. One of the virtues of Melvil's Peirce book is that he examines in great detail the many aspects of Peirce's philosophical output. In this respect he was introducing many Soviet philosophers to the com plexities of Peirce's thought. Of course he was not content simply to describe Peirce's ideas and arguments, and the interpretive device he employs is to emphasize the tension throughout Peirce's writings between objectivism and subjectivism, or what Melvil would have</page><page sequence="22">619 John Ryder called materialism and idealism. Peirce's categories, for example, embody this tension, Melvil argued, no less than his earlier analyses of modernist theories of knowledge. Firstness represents a certain sort of Platonism, Melvil says, while Secondness seems to emphasize objectively existing material entities. In the end there are several prob lems with this. First, Melvil is not confident that quality as designated by Firstness can be reconciled with the materiality and objectivity of Secondness. Firstness reappears in Santayana as the realm of essence and in Whitehead as eternal objects, and in none of these cases, he thinks, is there an adequate account of how pure quality is to be understood in relation to an objective and material world. Next, Peirce hedges on Secondness, trying to render it consistent with his overarching idealism, so the Peircean tension between objectivity and subjectivity characterizes Secondness itself. Finally, Thirdness on the one hand helps Peirce to develop interesting approaches to the un derstanding of universality and especially universal law. In this respect Peirce often comes close to what Melvil would recognize as a correct view of scientific law, i.e. as a symbolic expression of an existing ma terial relation and activity. On the other hand, Peirce also gave an explanation of law as a sign relation, and so on Melvil's view inter preting law so much in terms of the relations of thoughts to one another that lawful material processes disappear from the picture. Melvil also goes to some lengths to consider Peirce's theory of signs, and though he finds the same problems here as elsewhere in Peirce, he also recognizes the importance of Peirce's sign theory for the subsequent development of semiotics. Though obviously more work has been done in the course of a century, Peirce's work remains fundamental, he says, and many of his ideas and analyses are retained in contemporary work. The fact is that Melvil finds most congenial Peirce's analysis of the icon, since he regards it as expressing what is essentially a materialist point of view. A longer than usual citation helps to make the point: The most fundamental epistemological result that Peirce achieved through his analysis of the nature of the sign rela</page><page sequence="23">Turi . Melvil and American Pragmatism 620 tion and his topology of signs consists in his recognition that: 1 ) a sign is determined by some external object, to the ob jective existence of which one kind of sign, the index, points; 2) between an object and another kind of sign, the icon, there is a relation of resemblance or similarity. In other words, an icon reproduces or reflects its object; 3) an icon, being an "immediate image" of an object, is a unique kind of sign, which through its exact representation enables the discovery of new truths in relation to its object. Therefore the icon is at the foundation of all scientific reason ing, and also of the process of communication. (1968, 207) This is, he goes on, "in fact a rejection of the principles of his subjec tive and idealist theory of knowledge from the 1868 essays, and opened a way to further fruitful analyses of the epistemological function of the sign as the means of the reflection of reality." As we might expect, however, Melvil argues that Peirce's reluctance to abandon his own idealism makes it impossible to follow his own otherwise valuable analysis where it might have led him. Melvil thought his problem lay in the fact that he argued that a sign requires an interpr?tant, which means that a sign is always determined by another sign in an endless series, again divorcing sign, thought, meaning and eventually knowl edge from the objective world. "The basic contradiction of Peirce's treatment of the epistemological function of the sign," he said, "is that at one and the same time he both identifies and distinguishes thought and sign," and the cause of the contradiction is a "collision of the results of objective scientific analysis with a preconceived anti materialist tendency" (1968, 215-217). On Melvil's view, the dominant feature of Peirce's thought is his pragmatism, and it his there that many of Peirce's insights and short comings appear. As for the latter, it was in his pragmatism that Peirce's idealist side found its most overt and systematic expression, and so</page><page sequence="24">621 John Ryder for Melvil it was his pragmatism that defined Peirce's "tragedy." Melvil made the point many different ways, and it is essentially the same critical assessment as in his earlier works. According to pragmatism, on his view, "the purpose of thought is to guide human behavior, to direct its activity to changing conditions. But the pragmatists persis tently avoided the question whether thought provides true knowl edge of reality...This position is contradictory because, while correctly emphasizing the active character of thought and its significance for practical activity, pragmatism in fact rejects the necessary condition under which thought is able to guide action successfully: the rela tively accurate reflection of objective reality, the objective situation in which man has to act" (1968, 254). Melvil repeats the criticisms he had earlier made of "The Fixa tion of Belief," but he is more concerned here with what he calls Peirce's Principle, which is the theory of meaning articulated in "How to Make Our Ideas Clear." The principle that meaning resides in the practical effects of consequences of an idea "is the source and ground of the entire pragmatist trend, and without it there would be no pragmatism" (1968, 291). One of the misgivings Melvil had is that by reading the meaning of the concept of an object in terms of the "habits" of the object, the tendency is to dissolve the object into its habits, its effects, whereas Melvil was convinced that this would be a mistake. Peirce does have a point here, he thought, in that there are some concepts the content of which is revealed in people's actions. For example, the concepts of "truthfulness" or "courageousness" concern the traits of human character, and they are displayed in a person's actions. But still there is good reason to distinguish the ob ject from its effects. The revision in the conception of an object in turn raises the questions of the nature of truth and of what should be understood as "reality." Without belaboring the point, Melvil remained disturbed by the abandonment of a more traditional correspondence theory of truth, and by Peirce's attempt to define reality in terms of the agree ment of the community of inquirers. With respect to truth, though Peirce himself attempted to avoid a "vulgar" view that the truth is</page><page sequence="25">Yuri . Melvil and American Pragmatism 622 whatever serves our interests at the moment, his idealism did not allow him to develop an adequate alternative. The best he could do was to say that truth is the final opinion to which the application of the scientific method would lead all inquirers, but of course this de fines truth in terms of the process of inquiry instead of an objective reality. One of the reasons for this is that reality itself becomes de fined in terms of the process of inquiry, which not surprisingly Melvil opposes. By defining reality as that to which the community of in quirers would agree in the end, Peirce could not consistently mean that reality exists objectively and that the community of inquirers will reveal it in the long run. He could not be read this way because it would be inconsistent with the many other idealist features of his thought. In the end he conflates the real with thought about the real, Melvil says, and reality turns out to be dependent on how it is thought of (1968, 321-322). These are precisely the directions in which others took Peirce's pragmatist ideas, and the more scholarly, scientific side of him re sisted the move. He felt compelled to revise his concepts, and though he went to great lengths to do so, Melvil in the end finds them irre deemable. With respect to the pragmatist principle of meaning, Peirce attempted to give it a more experimentalist rendering, so that "prac tical effects" means not any sort of behavior, but only experimental results. Melvil wonders whether there isn't a "rational kernel" in this experimental version of the principle? His answer, aside from the de tailed and technical objections to the sort of operationalism that it involves, is that it is never sufficient to collapse the perceived effects of something with that which is causing the effects. Peirce's later pragmatism, including his attempts to refine the concepts of truth and reality, are not more defensible than the earlier versions. For Melvil what is most intriguing about all of this is that fact that Peirce continually tried to revise and improve his ideas. This is Peirce the scholar at work, the thinker who always suspected that what he had said was not good enough, and the scientist who under stood the fallibility of his method and the necessity for continuous reexamination of one's ideas. That Peirce had this side, and never</page><page sequence="26">623 John Ryder relinquished it, Melvil finds both admirable and regrettable. It is ad mirable that he seemed instinctively to have a sense of what Melvil calls the "dialectical nature of science, its critical and progressive spirit." The problem is that he also "so absolutized" the fallibilist conception of scientific inquiry "that he turned it into its opposite: in his hands the characteristically searching, critical and restless spirit of scientific inquiry is transformed into a rejection of the objective significance of science, into a universal skepticism and relativism" (1968,415). This, of course, is the regrettable feature of Peirce. The idealist and theist side of Peirce received yet another expres sion in his metaphysics, the final aspect of Peirce's thought with which Melvil deals. The goal of Peirce's metaphysical analyses was to de velop a conception of reality in which whatever is is spirit or derived from spirit. While pragmatism expresses a subjective idealism, Peirce's metaphysics is an overt objective idealism, and the two have some features in common and some in opposition. The opposition Melvil sees is simply the difference between subjective and objective ideal ism. The important feature they share is their anthropomorphism. The possibility of knowledge presupposes the affinity between the knower and the known, and Peirce posits a "spiritual" affinity be tween human beings and the universe in that he attributes mind and spirit to nature, Melvil says. Pragmatism embodies a similar anthro pomorphism by "determining the meaning of all, or at least intellec tual, concepts in terms of human action, habits, sensation and feel ing." In this respect there is no opposition between Peirce's pragma tism and his metaphysics because "both were for him only different sides of an anthropomorphic interpretation of reality" (1968, 448). As for the details of the metaphysics, Melvil not surprisingly finds a good deal lacking. In his tychism, for example, Peirce argued for the importance of chance in the universe as opposed to determinism. This is one of the respects in which Peirce was developing his ideal ism by contrast with materialism. He rejected determinism by criti cizing mechanistic determinism, which is then taken as a refutation of materialism. Melvil hastens to make the point, though, that it is simply not true that simple mechanistic materialism and determinism</page><page sequence="27">Yuri . Melvil and American Pragmatism 624 are the only forms of those ideas. If other versions are possible, then to reject mechanistic determinism is not to reject determinism in gen eral, and to reject mechanistic materialism is not to reject materialism in general. Peirce had made use of Hegel's objections to mechanical materialism, but he did not realize, any more than Hegel had, that an alternative, dialectical, materialism or determinism can be advanced, one that is not susceptible to the criticisms he had leveled against the mechanistic sort. Specifically, Melvil locates Peirce's mistake in treat ing chance and necessity as strict opposites, so that there can only be either absolute chance or absolute necessity, and of course he argued for an ultimate indeterminacy. He did not realize, Melvil says, that the correct observation that no phenomenon in nature follows pre cisely any formulated law is to be explained by the fact that natural phenomena always occur in complex conditions, so the fact that they do not precisely follow a law implies not absolute indeterminacy but rather the relevance of any number of natural laws with respect to a given phenomenon. The objectivity of chance, then, is a consequence of the complex interrelation of lawful relations, i.e. necessity. Chance is not absolute (1968, 451-452). By asserting the fundamental place of chance, Peirce is able in his synechism to infer the free activity of spirit, and here, along with the evolutionary love of his agapism, is the most direct and overt expression of his basic idealism. Melvil ends his book by asking again the question how best to understand the many strains of Peirce's thought. Certainly his prag matism stands out, if for no other reason than its influence on subse quent American philosophy, but there was more to Peirce than prag matism. Peirce anticipated many of the important developments in twentieth century philosophy: Bridgman's operationalism and through that the Vienna Circle; Bergson and Whitehead in his metaphysics; his phenomenology somewhat prefigures Husserl; and there is a di rect influence in logic and semiotics. But no one of these, including pragmatism, is by itself the trait that holds his thought together. The underlying feature of Peirce's thought, and the feature that indicates its inadequacy, is its idealism, from which all the rest, including prag matism, grew.</page><page sequence="28">625 John Ryder In the more than twenty years between the publication of the Peirce book and the early 1990s Melvil had an active scholarly life, returning several times to the study of American philosophy, though no single figure ever received the detailed treatment that Peirce had. He discussed pragmatism in general in a 1974 article titled simply "Pragmatism," and in 1986 he published "The Pragmatist Philoso phy of Man." One of his larger accomplishments, though, was his 1983 book titled The Course of XX Century Bourgeois Philosophy. In this work Melvil revisited his previous discussions of Peirce, James and Dewey, restating much of what he had said earlier. By 1983, however, pragmatism was beginning to experience a renewed inter est, largely through the work of Richard Rorty. Melvil made a point in the book of considering Rorty's neopragmatism. Rorty's version, he points out, is quite different from traditional pragmatism in that Rorty is not interested in the pragmatist theory of knowledge at all. Rorty, correctly on Melvil's view, emphasizes social practice in his account of what knowledge is, and he recognizes the importance of cultural life in the ongoing production of knowledge. Unfortunately Rorty overdoes it, Melvil thought, by rejecting in inquiry any ele ment beyond merely cultural practice, and then by applying the same conception to philosophy. Philosophy becomes, simply, a voice in the conversation. As Melvil puts is, "Even if philosophy is understood as one voice in the human conversation, it does not follow from this that that voice may speak in any old way it pleases" (1983, 214-215). Of course, Rorty does not deny that there is a world to be known, he simply holds, like James, that what the world is is determined by us - our interests, our views, our wills. So it appears, Melvil says, that there is nothing in Rorty that is not already in his philosophic "he roes." He is less individualistic than James was, treating the aggre gate opinions of a prevailing society as the final criterion and author ity. But he does not address the question why a society at a given time accepts one system of beliefs over another, or why one set of beliefs, norms or standards of thought change into another. One of the rea sons Rorty refuses to ask these questions, Melvil thinks, is his con formism, his attachment to prevailing practice, standards and norms</page><page sequence="29">Turi . Melvil and American Pragmatism 626 (1983, 223). 5. James Revisited By the early 1990s the social and intellectual atmosphere in Mos cow had changed radically from what it had been for Melvil's entire career. Of course the Soviet Union was gone, the cold war was over, and the old ideological battles that Melvil had fought had faded into memory. This itself may not have been as significant as it may seem at first glance, since as we have already seen, the ideological concerns had taken at most a distant back seat in Melvil's philosophical discus sions. More important, I think, was the changed intellectual environ ment with respect to dialectical and historical materialism. Nearly overnight it became as impossible as it once had been expected, to take for granted the propositions of Marxist philosophy. This does not mean that Marxist philosophers immediately gave up their Marx ism. Some surely did, but many did not and still have not. What it does mean is that the extraordinary, almost arrogant confidence with which Soviet philosophers had once asserted their points of view, not unlike the arrogance with which many philosophers assert whatever views they have, was undermined. It was no longer possible simply to say, as had happened so often in the past, that proposition a; was false because it contradicted the dialectical materialist proposition y. The worst of Soviet era philosophy did just this, though as much of Melvil's own work demonstrates, the better of Soviet philosophers did not. In any case, the confidence that one is right had to be shaken by the political events that led to the end of the Soviet Union, and that uncertainty is reflected in Melvil's last writings. Melvil's final words on pragmatism come in the form of two talks he gave on James in Moscow in 1992.1 Neither have been pub lished, but we have the manuscripts of those talks, and they give an interesting glimpse of Melvil's ideas, by way of both continuity and contrast with his earlier writings. Both papers bear the title "The Philosophy of William James," so we will distinguish them by desig nating one as 1992a and the other as 1992b. There are several strik ing features of these articles, particularly by contrast with the earlier</page><page sequence="30">627 John Ryder work. Melvil remained critical of pragmatist philosophy in general, but he had become far more sensitive to pragmatism's place in Ameri can culture and more sympathetic to James as a person and to the philosophic difficulties he faced. "James' universe," Melvil says, "is an open universe, always in the making. This idea of James is consonant with a typically Ameri can conception of the world and of America as a country open to any and all perspectives." And citing John McDermott, he notes a similar idea in Whitman, to the effect that America is not finished and never will be (1992b, 15). James was then a product of his culture and his times, and he responded to both in noteworthy ways. Melvil makes a point of highlighting the fact that James was himself a social progres sive, that "he was genuinely concerned with the presence of immo rality and evil in the world, with the existence of wealth and poverty, of oppressors and oppressed ? and in general he was disturbed by problems that Hamlet in his day expressed, and to which no decent person can remain indifferent" (1992b, 2). These problems included war and an emerging national foreign policy that prompted James to join the Anti-Imperialist League. This is, in other words, a much friendlier discussion than would have taken place earlier. Melvil remained interested in the same philosophical themes, however, specifically James' use of the concept of experience and his theory of truth. James' basic idea, Melvil says, and it runs through out his psychological and philosophical works, is the interrelation of the human individual and the universe, and the fundamental concept that James used to understand that relation was experience. As Melvil puts James' point, "Not only may the relation between man and the world not be broken, but in experience it is difficult to distinguish that which depends on the universe itself from that which is deter mined by man" (1992a, 6). For James, in other words, it make sense to regard experience as that from which the distinction between sub ject and object, or self and the world, emerge. This is the widest possible conception of experience, Melvil says, as it encompasses not only any possible interaction an individual might have with the world, ordinary, cognitive, moral aesthetic or religious, but even the world</page><page sequence="31">Yuri . Melvil and American Pragmatism 628 itself. The concept of experience had, he says, something of a "magi cal" quality for James (1992a, 6). It remained, however, the concept of truth that interested Melvil the most. He begins by noting that "In this country, and not only here, the pragmatist theory of truth has undergone especially bitter attacks," it presumably having been understood by his audience that he was referring in part to his own earlier writings (1992a, 11). The Soviet approach to James' theory of truth, following Lenin, he points out, had tended to treat it from "the caricatured view" that whatever is useful and advantageous is thereby true. But in fact, he adds, James' theory of truth is not so primitive. "When considering the pragmatist theory of truth one must bear in mind the extraordinary complexity of the problem, whether one is dealing with abstract theoretical questions of physico-mathematical knowledge or historical, social, moral or cultural questions" (1992a, 11). The basic idea of the theory of truth concerns the inherent rela tion between theoretical, cognitive human activity and practical ac tivity. Since cognitive activity is not self-contained, that is since it is influenced by practical activity and interests, its characteristics, in cluding the truth of its products, must be understood in relation to a person's entire life. James has a point here, although like others at the same time, Melvil says, he transformed the influence of practical ac tivity on cognition into a direct dependence of knowledge on prac tice. Schopenhauer and Nietzsche had made similar claims, and in the nineteenth century some philosophers had even begun to regard ideas, concepts or theories as true if 'they had power. After Peirce, James was the first philosopher to develop a theo retical elaboration of this issue by describing theories and concepts as tools necessary for activity. The pragmatist conception of truth, as Melvil had said years earlier, follows from Peirce's principle: if we want to know what something means then we must look to its conse quences, since its consequences are its meaning. It seems that James has a problem here, in that he conflates two different things: that which justifies our regarding a concept to be true, for example its successful use in practice, with the content of a true idea. After all, it</page><page sequence="32">629 John Ryder seems that a given idea or theory will be successful ifit is true, that is if it reflects objective reality. Success, we might say, testifies to the truth of a conception. This, Melvil says, is what the textbooks tell us, but is it so? At this point he proposes that the situation is in fact more complicated than just this. For one thing, we know of ideas that have been successful despite being false, so we can not simply explain the relation between truth and practical activity by saying that practice confirms truth. A traditional correspondence theory of this kind is based on common sense and ordinary experience, where it works just fine, Melvil says. But the pragmatists were concerned with other, more complex areas such as scientific hypotheses and their truth. Here things become more difficult. This sympathy with the difficulty of James' project should not be misread as agreement with James. Though willing to grant that the relation between truth and practical activity is more complicated than "the textbooks" say, he was not willing to go much further with James. Truth must be something distinct from practice or use, he suggests, even or especially in science, since in science we often do not know how an idea or theory will or can be useful, though we still may pursue its truth. This suggests what Melvil always thought to be a deep weakness in James' conception, that he regards all theories and concepts simply as instruments or weapons for action, affording them only instrumental meaning. However, despite weaknesses like these, we should not be dismissive of James, Melvil warns. We need to re member how novel his project was, that is the attempt to work out a conception of truth on new theoretical bases. Like any new idea, he says, James' work was prone to exaggeration, a feature exacerbated in part by the fact that James often wrote for public lectures and a wide audience (1992a, 16; 1992b 10). Melvil's sympathy for James as a person and for the philosophical challenges is evident, but he never warmed to pragmatism. Though in one essay he says that "there is no point in reproaching James here for subjective idealism," in the other he again points out the subjec tivism in much of the pragmatist project (1992a, 19; 1992b, 9). In any case, for Melvil the depth of James' philosophy, as for Peirce, lies</page><page sequence="33">Turi . Melvil and American Pragmatism 630 not in his pragmatism but elsewhere. First, James is significant for his general conception of philosophy as our individual way of represent ing our lives and its meaning. Unlike in science, any philosophy may stimulate ideas and be worthwhile in some respects, and James had an understanding of the power of this for individual lives. Second, James' contribution is in his multi-sided account of the question of the interrelation of the human individual and the universe. Finally, James' greatest legacy is his influence on the course of philosophy throughout the twentieth century (1992a, 19). 6. Conclusion Melvil's philosophical legacy will itself be assessed differently by different people. There are no doubt those who will find his commit ment to the principles of historical and dialectical materialism uncon vincing, and as a result his criticisms of pragmatism less than compel ling. There are also those who will see that there are serious ques tions to be raised about pragmatism, and that Melvil raised many of them. There are those, especially in Russia, who in the current envi ronment will associate Melvil with a past in which they no longer want to participate, and so will ignore his work. There is a certain sense in which this is appropriate, since there is always value in ap proaching texts directly, and the American philosophical heritage should be read on its own terms. In the not very long run, though, the social atmosphere in both the United States and more impor tantiy in Russia, will allow one to turn again to Melvil and to his studies of American philosophy. Melvil's writings will for a long time form the foundation of Russian language commentary on American pragmatism, and all those with an interest in American thought will remain in his debt.

I would like to thank both Melvil's wife and his son for mak ing available the manuscripts of these two unpublished talks on James. Without their copperation we would not have had access to Melvil's last thoughts on American philosophy. BIBLIOGRAPHY Melvil, Yuri . 1954.
