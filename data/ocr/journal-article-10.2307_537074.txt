<plain_text><page sequence="1">NATIVE MYTH AND MODERN RE- LIGION AMONG THE KLAMATH INDIANS By ROBERT F. SPENCER N A RECENT STUDY' of social change among the Klamath Indians of southern Oregon, informants revealed an unformalized synthesis of aboriginal and modern Christian religious beliefs. These involve, among other ideas, an identification of the Klamath culture hero with personages in the Christian pantheon such as the God-Father, Jesus, and Satan. This is of interest since the contemporary Klamath have lost all formalized aspects of their older culture. The major institutions of the past have fallen by the way and, in their overt forms at least, have been replaced by those of the encroach- ing Anglo-American society. Acculturation is so far along that the observer can elicit only covert survivals of aboriginal ideas. Although the tone of the folk culture has been lost by the Klamath, the reservation life, a common economy, and the wardship status enforced by external governmental agencies combine to effect a haphazard solidarity in the group. It is hence not sur- prising to discover a rephrasing of older values to meet modern situations. A case in point is the attempt by many tribal members, young and old, to find continuity in folklore and so to read Christian meaning into aboriginal myth. Klamath culture of the past was not essentially different in its orientation from that of many western tribes. Because the tribe was geographically mar- ginal to several culture areas, it is possible to note the composite nature of its culture and to discern the realignment and reintegration of elements which it shared with California, the Plateau-Basin, and the Northwest Coast. In its overall configuration, the native culture differed from that of the adjacent gathering peoples because the Klamath had settled on the lakes and marshes of the region and depended on fish and a wild water-lily. Beyond the basic economic structure, however, one may note the California flavor of the separa- tistic hamlets with their loose social and political organization; the weakly developed (and possibly late) wealth complex, suggestive of the Northwest and the Oregon coast; and the formalized shamanistic religion which points to affinities with tribes in the Plateau, California, and elsewhere.2 1 This paper is based on data collected during two summer field sessions, 1948 and I949, on the Klamath Reservation. Field research was subsidized by grants no. 21 (Reserve Fund, I947) and no. I132 (i949) from the American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, and by research funds from the Department of Anthropology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. 2 Cf.

Hodge Anniversary Volume, III, Los Angeles, 217</page><page sequence="2">Journal of American Folklore To treat aboriginal Klamath religion under three headings of shamanism, power quest, and cosmology is patent oversimplification. In nature and content these features formed an integrated configuration reflecting a major cultural preoccupation. It is true that the shaman in each community played a dominant role and in his capacity as curer, magician, and entertainer com- manded the utmost in social prestige. On the other hand, as was common in western North America, every individual, at puberty and thereafter, de- liberately and repeatedly sought contact with a variably defined spirit world. Thus Klamath culture had a variation of the American Indian guardian- spirit theme. Less specifically formalized, and so perhaps, less well integrated, were the elements of myth and tale, the rationalizations for the presence of various natural phenomena, for eschatology, and for the general conception of the universe. Like adjacent tribes, the Klamath interested themselves in animal spirits. These were of particular importance in providing shamanistic power. In the individual power quest, however, the sources from which spiritual forces emanated were less specifically defined. A rather wide range of super- natural powers was recognized, some being animals, some vaguely anthro- pomorphic, others relating to such natural features as mountains, streams, rocks, or even landmarks like Crater Lake. In respect to these forces an involved folklore has arisen which allows some classification of the Klamath concepts of the supernatural. In this realm, for example, are views about the abode of the dead and the nature of ghosts and souls, these being carefully differentiated from nonhuman spirits.3 Here too is a body of myth relating to superhuman dwarf men and women, to the forces in specific places or natural phenomena in the Klamath terrain, and finally, the most important for this discussion, to the culture hero, the anthropomorphic Kemu'kemps.4 Kemu'kemps, while not usually identified with an animal spirit, has many characteristics suggesting the folklore regarding Coyote in the Plateau- Basin. He is at once creator and trickster, angrily forbidding in some contexts, indifferent in others, and in still others a ludicrous buffoon. Essentially human in conceptualization (a myth complex relating to a human hero also occurs in adjacent regions), Kemu'kemps is sometimes identified with the marten, whose younger brother is weasel, and with the winds.5 In the myths assembled by Gatschet, he constantly rivals his magically born son 'Aygig, whose destruction he repeatedly plans, often with the result of encompassing his own. Weather, such as rain or heat, was also attributed to him. Kemu'kemps is also the creator, and there are numerous folktales which tell how he brought various locations into being.

To summarize, while the culture hero was not himself a source of power for men, the forces at his command were essentially the same as those which every Klamath sought in a formalized quest. Although concerned with natural phenomena like winds, heat, and rain, Kemu'kemps was on the whole indifferent to the fate of men. Like other anthropomorphic or zo6morphic culture heroes, he became the theme of many tales, a source of amusement and entertainment in the abori- ginal Klamath culture. But even though humor was present in the tales con- cerning him, he appears to have been regarded as real and with a slight tinge of awe. There is no question of his marked importance in the aboriginal culture. To evaluate properly the Klamath culture hero in the modified setting of the contemporary society, attention must be paid to the religious modifi- cations in the group since the inception of culture change through the encroach- ment of Anglo-American settlers. The Klamath were never drawn into hostilities with the Whites, unlike their linguistic relatives, the Modoc. Contacted sporadically by Europeans from 1825 on, the Klamath were ultimately drawn into a treaty with the United States in I864. This reflected pioneer movements to the west and the growth of White population in Oregon. An enforced culture change began with the treaty.7 There was as a result proscription of the shaman's ecstatic curing activities and an intensity of Christian missionization. Other introductions included a new technology, White education in reservation boarding schools, a new status in relation to an established administrative agency, and new concepts of property, society, and political tribe.8 The result was in some instances chaotic rebellion, a resistance which took the form not so much of open revolt but rather of a half-hearted and often uncomprehending shift to new cultural values and patterns. The effects are observable today in the tacit rejection of governmental administration and external Euro-American social goals, and in the dis- organization of society and personality on the reservation. Klamath history is well known since the treaty of I864. Like many western American tribes, the Klamath were ripe for the native messianic movements, the cults which promised a return to the past and implied expulsion of the European oppressor. An example is the Ghost Dance of I870.9 Here Christian 6Gatschet, pt. I, 131-132. Some informants suggest that the name for Crow or Raven, Ka'Bkemps, is the same as Kemu'kemps. This is doubtful, of course. Parenthetically, many modern Klamath insist that there are no snakes in the Williamson River valley because all were turned to stone by Crow's laughter. 7 Philleo Nash, "The Place of Religious Revivalism in the Formation of the Intercultural Community on Klamath Reservation," in Social Anthropology of North American Tribes, ed.

The acculturation process also involved modification and integration of Ghost Dance forms introduced from adjacent tribes.10 The growth of tribal, rather than hamlet, factions split the reservation at this time, and there was the pattern, familiar among other Indians, of chief rivalling shaman and of pro- gressive against conservative. While the 1870 cult is one abortive attempt at native cultural revival, the post-contact history of the Klamath is replete with illustrations of a religiously conceived resistance to the disrupting pressures from without. Variously listed are the Earthlodge Cult, the Dream Dance, and several other revivalistic and messianic forms." By about 1900, nativistic movements on the Klamath Reservation had burned themselves out. Tribal life of a half century ago was fraught with essentially the same problems which dog it today. People entered into economic competition in the greater society and became nominally Christian (and so lent Methodist sanctions to social institutions). However, the older values were only with difficulty accommodated to the new. One or two shamanistic practitioners survived but others felt that their power was gone. One infor- mant tells of her uncle, a shaman, saying sadly, "My songs (shaman power) have left me." Shamanism as an integrating factor in Klamath life and in that of other Pacific Northwest groups is reflected in another important movement, somewhat different from the frenzied Ghost Dance. This is the Shaker Cult, also a synthesis of native and Christian elements but with longer range objectives. Originating in the north in the I88o's, it diffused slowly, reaching the Klamath in i914.12 Basically Christian in its orienta- tion, the Shaker Cult admits a fundamentalistic Protestant eschatology; but in its emphasis on a "God is Light" theme, the employment of the cross as a particularly efficacious holy symbol, the use of bells, and the presence of curing seances, it assumed a peculiar flavor. Numerous aboriginal elements also are discernible.l3 Techniques reminiscent of shamanistic curing are em- ployed (for example, the removing of causes of disease from the sufferer's body by means suggestive of shamanistic legerdemain), although the Shakers vigorously disclaim the older shamans, describe their work as of the devil, and insist that the spirit of God effects Shaker cures. But the Shaker Cult, too, although it enjoyed a following on the Klamath Reservation for some years, is dying. A few older people now meet in each other's homes for services. The Shaker church at Chiloquin, Oregon, is now rarely used, and the younger 10 Spier, 1927, p. 45. The Ghost Dance was evidently introduced from the Northern Paiute. The Klamath held that Kemu'kemps was coming from the south and that the dead were to return. See p. 53. 11 Nash, 1937, pp. 412-435; cf.

Marian Smith (New York, I949), PP. 37-76. 220</page><page sequence="5">Native Myth and Modern Religion reservation residents are not attracted. Like its more dramatic predecessors, the Shaker religion fails as a bulwark against societal disorganization. The modern Klamath are in the main nominally Christian. Many are allied with local churches: Protestant groups attract a fair following; some are Roman Catholics; others now and again join the itinerant Pentecostal and Holiness groups. While many Klamath are unquestionably religious in the accepted Christian sense, the church offers a primary social outlet to those who value group association. Whatever the function of the church on the reservation today, apparently it has no aboriginal vestiges in its ritual or organization. It would be impossible to say to what extent tribal members find a link with the native past in the spiritual curing practices of such bodies as the Pentecostal Assemblies of God, which, however, clearly make no con- cessions to aboriginal concepts. It thus seems evident that the overt forms of tribal religion are gone. The Klamath majority is now avowedly Christian even though church affiliation is not universal. Religious attitudes seem highly diverse. Some individuals, while indifferent to religious tenet, are admittedly attracted by the display or by social opportunities. Some are devout, others ignore the churches en- tirely. Still others, whether or not church members, speculate on religious questions, show considerable introspective preoccupation, or are frankly curious about native religion and Christianity. Their opinions and attitudes demonstrate that the aboriginal past is not wholly dead. In this considera- tion, shamanistic curing may be ruled out, since modern medicine is generally accepted by the Klamath and, in any case, shamanistic patterns have merged with the decaying Shaker Cult. Since this is so, the less formalized aspects of the aboriginal religion survive to intrude now and again into modern con- ceptualization. The survival of cosmological features may still be observed here and there. For example, tales of people and animals turned to stone by Crow's laughter are half-credulously recounted by young and old. A surviving custom or two, reflecting the older world-view, might also be noted. A boy who kills his first deer is well advised not to eat its meat himself. By giving the game away, he averts failure in his next hunting expedition. Hunting on the reservation today is a sport, no economic value being attached to it. (Aboriginally too, the Klamath were so well adapted to their specialized lake-marsh economy that hunting played a distinctly minor part.) This custom, which may stem from the emphasis on wealth and generosity, is laughed down today but it is still practised. Another very common belief is that animals can speak Klamath but not English. A howling coyote is recognized by young and old as a har- binger of death; the owl says, "'Maklaks, 'maklaks," which "when you hear it, it means somebody close to you is going to die." The Klamath word means human and refers to the tribe itself. Taboos on the first game of the hunter, the first wild foods gathered, as well as fear of the owl are widely distributed among western tribes. But more pertinent here are the modern Klamath views based on the past which either influence actual behavior or bridge a gap, conceptually, specu- 221</page><page sequence="6">Journal of American Folklore latively, or rationally, between past and present. There is good evidence that the need for the power quest has not entirely disappeared, while on the mythological side, notions concerning the culture hero Kemu'kemps often recur. The aboriginal power quest was highly formalized. Every Klamath, ap- parently regardless of sex, sought power frequently. While puberty was usually a starting point for these contacts with the supernatural, the power obtained could be lost and might be sought again. A series of related concepts existed: a sense of humility, fasting, a lonesome vigil, purification by sweating, and other elements encountered among many Indian tribes. The Klamath emphasized the inspirational song as evidence of the contact, and the word /Suw'i.s/ meant spirit song, spirit power, or the spirit itself, depending on context.14 With the breakdown of the older culture, missionary activity from without and the consequent imposition of new values, the formalized behavior associated with the power quest fell away. But because it was highly in- dividualized and unquestionably was an integrative factor in personality, it was not wholly abandoned. Probably the nativistic movements, the Shakers, the Pentecostalists, or the other emotional outlets permitted substitutions. One cannot gauge how widely persistent is a sense of individual rapport with the unseen world; certainly it is not discussed at the present time. The examples cited here are essentially unintentional expressions of older in- formants. Undoubtedly, these statements are an index to the emotions as- sociated with the institutionalized aboriginal quest. A paralytic woman, bedridden, aged about eighty, remarked as follows to me, "Every day I pray to the mountain. I lie here in my bed and I am sick and old and every morning I say to those mountains, I say, 'Bless me, help me.' I pray just like my mother taught me to do. I ask the river to help me. I say, 'River, help me; give me strength.' And I look over to that rock over there and I get help. My mother taught me to pray to rocks and mountains and to give some food to them before we eat. It's just like in the Bible. I dream of those mountains at night. They kind of help you when you ask it." She also recounts a visit to Crater Lake: "When I was young, I went up to Crater Lake with a woman I knew. She tied my eyes and led my horse, up, up. Then she said, 'Untie your eyes,' and I nearly fell off the horse. I saw a man .standing on the water far away,. just like in the Bible. He scared me so. I don't know who that was, but I like to think of that man now." The in- formant refers here to the common Klamath myth of water beings, visions of whom were apparently a significant part of the spirit quest. Another older male informant gives a similar view of natural phenomena: "When I was young, I used to hear my grandfather and father talking. They said to me, 'You rustle around and get power; you pray to the rocks.' I never did, but once I was sick and I tried it. 'Help me, I am sick,' I said. Oh, it was good; they kind of made me feel good, them mountains did. Now I'm a real Christian [a converted Shaker] and I pray to God and Christ. Those things help you, but maybe it's the Devil that's working against God." 14 Spier, 1930, pp. 94-100. 222</page><page sequence="7">Native Myth and Modern Religion Other informants also give a hint of this attitude. Even where there is sophistication by virtue of education or long-time residence away from the group, one encounters statements like that of a woman, half-Klamath, half- Caucasian: "Those old Indians had a lot of sense. They kind of felt at home around here and they would get a lift just from talking to the mountains and lakes. It was like praying and it made them feel at peace. When I get up in the morning, I look first over there [at Mt. Pitt] and it makes me feel good too. Not that I pray in the old Indian way; that's just idolatry. But it's like the scenery kind of gets ahold of you even if I been seeing it all my life." A possible indication of this attitude appears in the repeated warnings to children to avoid certain rocks and cliffs. "You might fall down and hurt yourself" is of course quite true; on the other hand, places about which some modern Klamath parents feel particularly uneasy were associated aboriginally with power sources. A strong drive in the past was fear that a child might be harmed through contact with "power." Every effort was made to keep the child away from the shaman, the sweat lodge, the mourning place, and the like. (It may be noted that menstrual blood was placed near the cradled child to negate forces whose mere presence could harm the inexperienced.) These attitudes toward nature and the surrounding natural phenomena, at least as sources of uneasiness, still exist among younger Klamath of today. Also obtainable is evidence on attitudes toward the culture hero. Some offer a rational systematization of beliefs concerning him. Generally, this involves some interpretation in the light of Christian reasoning. Kemu'kemps, because of his essentially human characteristics, readily lends himself to identification with the Christian God. The middle-aged woman quoted above, struck by the linguistic parallels, notes: "Those old Indians were really Christians. It's only the liquor around here that makes the unbelief and trouble. Kemu'kemps means the 'Old One'; that's God. He revealed himself to the Indians long before the Americans [sic] came. He had a son, too, 'Aygig, that's just like Jesus. He created the world, just like it says in the Bible. If only those old Indians had been able to see it, they were close to God all the time. They lived good upright lives under his guidance. Another word for Kemu'kemps in our language is Playtul'kni.; that means the 'One on High,' 'Somebody up there.' That's the name we give God in our language now. It's all the same." Not all informants are so definite in their syncretism. One elderly woman remarked: "Who is Kemu'kemps? I don't know. Sometimes I think he's God, but sometimes I think he must be Devil. Maybe he was just a story the old Indians made up. But they called him Playtul.kni- and that means God. My grandson asked me, 'Gramma, who's Kemu'kemps?' I say, 'I don't know. Maybe he's like God.' " In another connection she remarked: "I think that Kemu'kemps is Devil. He gets people into trouble; he leads them into tempta- tion. When I was a little girl, they said to me, 'He's no good; don't believe that any more.' But I don't know. I see the icicles and I think of the wind and Kemu'kemps. He made the world and they call him Playtul'kni.. The Devil 223</page><page sequence="8">Journal of American Folklore is Mu-natul'kni- ("The One Below"). They say Kemu'kemps is everywhere and that's like God. I think about that sometimes." Undoubtedly, a confusion arises because of the adoption by missionaries, years ago, of terms for the Christian God which the Klamath had applied to the culture hero. The overlapping of Christian and native concepts is readily seen and provides a basis for debate and doubt.15 It may be profitable to note some of the views and to determine how variable present attitudes are. There is scarcely any standardization except a very prevalent view that Kemu'kemps is somehow real. The statements which follow were made by Klamath in response to the general question: What is Kemu'kemps? One man, aged about seventy-four, remarked to Hiroto Zakoji, University of Oregon: "Kemu'kemps disappears when he wants to. He tells what will happen and it happens exactly. He gives power to the Indian doctors [shamans] and sends them their songs. But I heard in stories that Kemu'kemps does bad things; he does tricks. I think he is mean, too. God in the Bible is mean sometimes, too. In the Bible it says that God is a jealous god. That's in the first Genesis [sic] and the Ten Com- mandments says that, too .... Sometimes I think Kemu'kemps is the Devil himself. There is a place near the dam over near Chiloquin on this side of the river. There is a big rock sticking out over there near a cave. Kemu'kemps tricks people to go there and dance when a girl reaches the age [puberty]. He misleads people. But God sometimes does bad things; he made Adam and Eve, but he also made the apple." Two older male informants told separately versions of a myth about Kemu'kemps as a trickster. In the tale, the culture hero set what appeared to be venison up on poles. When the people present asked for some, he at once welcomed them to a feast. To their horror, they found that they were eating Kemu'kemps' feces. The hero laughed and disappeared. The remarks of a man, aged sixty-two, are of interest: "Can you imagine him doing a thing like that? I think that's just a disgusting old Indian story. God wouldn't do a thing like that, so Kemu'kemps must be Devil. But God made plagues in Egypt and maybe that's what this was like." Although some informants conclude that the culture hero is an older revela- tion of the Christian God, others, as may be seen, are equally convinced that he is allied with or is the Christian Satan. But the ambivalent attitude appears to be most characteristic. H. Zakoji, of the University of Oregon, reports the following statement from a 74-year-old male informant: "I don't know what he is, God or Devil or what he is. According to the Bible, we worship one God. Nobody ever saw God and white people say that. That's what gets me. Kemu'kemps dealt with the Indians only. He must be before Christ came and he must have disappeared when Christ came." In another connection, he said to me: "If Kemu'kemps disappeared when Christ came, then Christ conquered him. They say when Christ died, he conquered sin and the Devil. 16 These statements suggest the views of Father Wilhelm Schmidt and their implications as given in his High Gods of North America (Oxford, 1933), especially chap. 8. 224</page><page sequence="9">Native Myth and Modern Religion That's why Kemu'kemps disappeared when Christ came. But then I remember them talking when I was young about how Kemu'kemps was coming back. That was all lies so I guess Kemu'kemps must be the Devil. Still, they say he created all just like God. I don't know how to figure it." Mention was made above that the culture hero had a son who was born miraculously. The possible relationship between 'Aygig and Jesus has caught the fancy of some. A man of seventy comments: "Yes, Kemu'kemps and God are one and the same. There's a story that says how Kemu'kemps saved a woman's baby when she jumped into the fire and that baby was raised as his own son. I don't believe it. God created all living things. He made the Devil, too. I think 'Aygis is the Devil because he's always trying to get the best of his father. We old Indians knew about God but we didn't know about our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ." A 56-year-old woman remarked: "Yes, Kemu'kemps is God and he had a son, just like Jesus. 'Aygig even dies and comes alive again in the old Indian stories, and that's like the Christians teach. And that Holy Ghost business, that's the power that God gives. The Indians knew about that. That's why you say 'Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.' " But so concise a syncretism of aboriginal and Christian religious elements is rare. Younger people vary greatly in belief. One man, about thirty-eight, noted: "Kemu'kemps? They told us stories about him when we were kids. They said he's like God. It doesn't matter to me. Maybe he is; they always say how he made everything around here. Maybe he did; things get that way somehow." A 3I-year-old woman remarked: "Kemu'kemps stuff is what they tell kids. That's old Indian devil-talk. I don't know nothing about it." And a I6-year-old girl stated: "I've heard my grandmother talk about Kemu'kemps. That's kind of scary stuff like the dead coming back to haunt you. There's a cave up on the Sprague River where they say Kemu'kemps used to live. Maybe he still lives there. Anyway, I wouldn't walk up that road in the dark." A woman of about fifty-five, when questioned about the religious training she gave the grandchild entrusted to her care, answered: "Children learn about the Bible very fast. I tell my granddaughter the old Bible stories and she likes to hear them. But I steer off of that old Indian stuff. I think we ought to get away from those old Indian superstitions. I'll sure get mad if anybody scares her with stories about those old Indian things like Kemu'kemps." Her statement sets the tone for the future. The old beliefs are being lost, and although still very general, they stand out most vividly only in the minds of those who were raised in the period of the second Ghost Dance and the analogous revivalistic movements which followed it. While they obtained, during their upbringing, a detailed background of native Klamath mythology, they succeed, according to their own inclinations, in passing on their point of view to their descendants, or they may fail to do so. The attitudes indicated above are individual; no debate about the nature of Kemu'kemps or related concepts has been noted. While the formally organized religious groups, including the Shakers (however dependent on the aboriginal patterns of 225</page><page sequence="10">Journal of American Folklore shamanism and curing), consistently oppose any such conceptual survival, the point does not emerge as a significant controversy. Thus, despite the decline of Klamath culture, something of the aboriginal world-view persists. If the unformalized aspects of culture have a greater life- expectancy than the formalized and institutionalized ones, then the point of view reflected in myth, a series of cultural premises, must in some form out- last the setting of the point of view into motion through actual behavior. This has apparently happened among the Klamath. The overt behavioral aspects are gone entirely, but some individuals uneasily attempt to bridge a gap. The mechanisms which produced a Ghost Dance and a Shaker Cult are now merely vestigial but still present.
