(For, from living creatures it made dead ones, changing their forms.) —Empedocles1 But whate'er I be, Nor I, nor any man that but man is, With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eas'd With being nothing. —Shakespeare, Richard II, 6.5.38-41. Freud, so often the revolutionary iconoclast when treating of hallowed doctrine, accepted without his customary critical acumen the conventional version of the origin and destiny of life. We are all familiar with his theory of instincts, how he proclaimed that all life yearns to return again to the inorganic matter whence it had sprung. Freud relentlessly stressed not only that sleep and death constituted efforts to achieve, within the womb, surcease from strife, but that all living creatures are driven by an inexorable instinct, which cannot be over come, to be restored to the initial starting point, the inorganic. Like the Jewish people which had given him birth, Freud fervently believed and desired that life could go home again and remain there. His concept of inevitable return to the womb, and beyond to inorganic matter, surely derived from his own earliest nurture by a mother from that nomadic race of Jews to whom the great motivating ideal had ever been to locate a resting place and cease their weary wanderings, in some home where they could never be disturbed. Although rejecting Jewish religion, classifying himself as an atheist, Freud nevertheless embraced, as we know, the Zionist Mes sianic dream of a final, permanent homeland. Nor could he rid himself of the Elohistic dictum, "Dust thou art, and unto dust shall thou return."2 So often did he repeat the thought that life aims to rejoin lifeless matter that one must suspect</page><page sequence="2">24 Imago an irresistible lure drew him on, and that the concept, pessi mistic as it might seem to others, held for him a refuge from anxiety and travail. It provided him, apparently, with the method for making peace with this painful world and his own inner turmoil. To summarize the Freudian thesis : Life came from death to which it returns. Sandor Ferenczi, Freud's favored disciple, formulated a variant of his master's thesis, deriving his insights from Empedocles. Ferenczi asks us "to drop once and for all the question of the beginning and the end of life and conceive the whole inorganic and organic world as a perpetual oscillating between the will to live and the will to die in which an absolute hegemony on the part either of life or of death is never attained."3 Following Empedocles, Ferenczi thus attempted to place both life and death in an equal status, living matter and dead matter as partners in the universe merging one into another in an endless dialectic with neither assuming a dominant posi tion or priority. Instead we have twins who strive unsuccess fully for victory through the eons in eternal sibling rivalry. However, in developing his argument, Ferenczi cites a remarkable passage from Nietzsche : What if, however, death and dying were not anything absolute, if germs of life and regressive tendencies lay hidden even within inorganic matter, if Nietzsche were right when he said, 'All inor ganic matter has originated out of organic, it is dead organic matter. Corpse and man.'4 Ferenczi apparently misunderstands Nietzsche's remark. He assumes that Nietzsche does not mean precisely what he said, namely that organic matter preceded inorganic matter and that inorganic matter is nothing but the dead body of organic matter. For if Ferenczi had understood this, he could not have ignored its implications as he did. He goes on refer ring like a faithful Freudian to the drive of the It to return to the womb, to a previous state of existence which he accepts as inorganic matter. Nietzsche, on the contrary, gave priority to organic matter as the original substance of the universe whence all inorganic matter evolved. We know that Nietzsche later in his life developed a fond</page><page sequence="3">Thanatopsis: Life's Last Stand 25 theory of eternal recurrence which, in some mystic manner, held that everything that is or has been will be perpetually restored to its precise position in the perpetual turn of the universal wheel. Nietzsche's cyclical idea, like the cyclical visions of Empedocles and Ferenczi, seemingly denies Freud's concept of the finality of the organic experience, for nowhere does Freud assert specifically that life, having begun in the inorganic, can be revived thence. Perhaps Freud left this to be understood, rather than stated, since he did hold that organic matter found its origin in dead matter, a miracle that certainly rendered plausible the resurrection of life. In effect, Freud's theory vitiates neither the Nietzchean or Emped oclean notions of continuous oscillation between the dead and the live. Now, however, we must return to Nietzsche's original insight, repudiated in part by his subsequent thought. In 1873, the herald of Ubermensch jotted notes while studying pre Platonic philosophers. In a little collection of these, Nietzsche dealt with Empedocles of Acragas : The symbolism of sexual love (Geschlechtsliebe). Here as in the Platonic fable the longing after Oneness (Einssein) shows itself, and here, likewise, is shown that once a greater unity already existed (grossere Einheit hergestellt) ; were this greater unity established, then this would again strive after a still greater one. The conviction of the unity of everything living guarantees that once there was an immense Living Something (ein ungeheures Lebendiges gab), of which we are pieces (von dem wir Stucke sind) ; that is probably the Sphairos itself. He is the most blessed deity. Everything was connected only through love [Empedocles = philial, therefore in the highest degree appropriate. Love has been torn to pieces and splintered by hatred [Empedocles = neikosl, love has been divided into her elements and killer—bereft of life... in the whirl no living individual originates (Italics mine—SH) . . . Love, blind as she is, with furious haste again throws the elements one against another endeavoring to see whether she can bring them back to life or not. Here and there she is successful. It continues (Es setzt sich fort). A presentiment originates in the living beings, that they are to strive after still higher unions (Vereinigungen) than home and the primal state. Eros. Even in this chaotic aphoristic development of Emped ocles' philosophy, Nietzsche has not abandoned faith in a final return to the original state of ein ungeheures Lebendiges. For he continues: It is a terrible crime to kill life, for thereby one works back to the Primal Discord. Some day everything will be again one single life, the most blissful state. (Einstmals soll alles wieder ein einziges Leben sein, der seligste Zustand.)</page><page sequence="4">26 Imago Thus he anticipates the doctrine of the Eternal Return. But it is his starting point which is of greatest interest to us here, for he proceeds to postulate : All inorganic matter has originated out of organic, it is dead organic matter. (Alle unorganische Materie ist aus organischer entstanden, es ist todte organische Materie.) 5 If Nietzsche had carried his own construction to its logical conclusion, instead of panting after resurrection, he might have elaborated an entirely different system. Under his dic tum, expressed above, the It's drive to return to the womb is self-preservative, not deathward. It constitutes an effort on the part of the It to avoid death, that is, to avoid running down into unreclaimable inorganic matter, by being restored to organic matter. This wish of the It is doomed to perpetual frustration and failure, since we have not a cycle but instead a line or descent, the Fall of Man. Therefore, we can only conclude that if organic matter preceded inorganic matter, if the inorganic be nothing but the debris or the corpse of organic matter, then the It's fervent urge to be restored to the womb constitutes its need to go back indeed, back to original, organic matter. This is its desperate effort to avoid the ultimate doom of falling into inorganic death. Nietzsche evidently credits Empedocles with having ap proached the position outlined above. But we must note that Empedocles did not believe in the ultimate disintegration of life into inorganic matter. Empedocles is quoted as having taught, "And I shall tell you another thing : there is no creation of substance in any one of mortal existences, nor any end in execrable death, but only mixing and exchange of what has been mixed." (Frag. 8.) ". . . from what in no wise exists, it is impossible for anything to come into being; and for Being to perish completely is incapable of fulfillment and unthink able ; for it will always be there, wherever anyone may place it on any occasion." (Frag. 12.) "... A wise man would not conjecture such things in his heart, namely, that so long as they are alive (which they call Life), they exist, and experience bad and good fortune ; but that before mortals were combined and after they were dissolved, they are nothing at all." (Frag. 15.)</page><page sequence="5">Thanatopsis: Life's Last Stand 27 However, it is possible that Nietzsche divined the inner meaning of another fragment of Empedocles that reads : "For from living creatures it made them dead, changing their forms [and from dead, living]." (Frag. 125.)6 The addition of the phrase "and from the dead, living" to the Empedocles* fragment is merely conjecture by an editor, Kranz, and may not have existed in the text as transmitted by Clement of Alexandria (Stromata 3.14.). Of course, it can be argued that Nietzsche nowhere says that the inorganic that stems from organic does not in turn run back into organic, in accordance with Empedocles and with Nietzsche's own dream of eternal return. We prefer to take the proposition as it stands, an indication of an insight of enormous importance, attempting to examine a crucial cosmological problem from every conceivable angle. We dare say even that Nietzsche may not have had the thought that we credited him with, but he ought to have had that thought. In other words, if he did not think it, we will think it for him. It is reasonable then to contend that inorganic matter is unre claimable for the production of organic matter, current bio logical theories and ancient Greek philosophy to the contrary. Cyclical thought is most natural to man because it is womb inspired. Our lives, begun in a circle, continue to spiral in circular patterns readily adopted by the Ego. But primitive and classical mythologies all indicate a more profound observation, that life comes only from life, ex vita vita. They reduplicate the theme abundantly with cosmic eggs, divine mothers, heavenly fathers, celestial trees, etc. The unconscious clearly perceives the organization of the universe as primarily organic, whence each life form has splintered off. Jesus, according to the Gospel of St. Thomas, remarked that if the flesh came into existence because of the spirit, it is a wonder, but if the spirit came into existence because of the flesh, it is a wonder of wonders.8 We might modify this in view of the conflict of theories presented here. If the dead came into existence because of the living, that would be a wonder, but if the living came into the world because of the dead, that would be a wonder of wonders. The unreasonable proposition that life came from death, or that both existed simultaneously reminds us of the psychotic Hebraic fantasy of the female</page><page sequence="6">28 Imago born of the male, or the tortured creation myths of the filiarch societies which hold that a male deity served as the generator of all things. Life comes from life, insists the un conscious, and death came from life. This economical monistic approach to cosmology replaces cyclical with linear thought. Its conclusions are hardly more pessimistic although from it we can derive no comforting faith in rebirth or personal or species immortality. In the words of Thomas Wolfe, "You can't go home again." Since our topic is not the origin of Freud's ideology in the development of his theory of instincts, we shall resist the temptation to discuss the obvious parallel between the passage cited above, written by Nietzsche in 1873, and Freud's own reflections on the same subject. There is one major point in which Freud does deviate from the ideas expressed therein. This concrns Nietzsche's daring idea that in the beginning everything consisted of a monstrous living being from which all life and all inorganic matter descends. If, for the sake of analysis, we accept Nietzsche's suggestion, based upon his studies of the fragments of Empedocles, to the effect that originally the universe was composed of organic matter and that the gradual breakdown of this organic matter created in turn death and inorganic matter, which is unreclaimable by the primary material, we will in effect stand current meta physical thought on its head, viewing it perhaps paradoxically but not fruitlessly. I am aware that we can challenge this premise of life running down unreclaimably into inorganic matter on the basis of the so-called nitrogen cycle and other analogous natural phenomena. However, reviewing the nitrogen cycle or similar manifestations indicates that at no point does the organic molecule return again as an organic molecule. On the contrary, everything we know seems so point to its extinction in that form, its achievement of the death drive in the form of inorganic matter. Undoubtedly we prefer to believe, as do Vico and his followers, in the perpetual return of organic life. This, in its own way, constitutes a species of immortality, a substitute for personal resurrection. We do no more here than draw a few cursory conclusions from an opposite view.</page><page sequence="7">Thanatopsis: Life's Last Stand 29 Certain necessary results spring from utilizing the linear concept, diametrically opposed to and in conflict with prevail ing theories, specifically the famous Eros-Thanatos doctrine of Freud. For example, by the light of our concept we see death as surrender of the It to a natural development requiring the dissolution of organic material into inorganic, instead of regarding it with Freud as the suicide of the Ego. It would seem that the mechanism of the fear of death can only be that the Ego relinquishes its narcissistic libidinal cathexis in a very large measure—that is, that it gives up itself, just as it gives up some external object in other cases in which it feels anxiety. For Freud, death is the loss of love sustained by the ego, which equates love with life, i.e., the love of the superego. These considerations make it possible to regard the fear of death, like the fear of conscience, as a development of the fear of cas tration. He stresses that "the id, to which we finally come back, has no means of showing the Ego either love or hate. It can not say what it wants; it has achieved no unified will. How else can eros and the death instinct struggle within it . . . ?"9 In a book published in 1907, to which Freud contributed an approving preface, Wilhelm Stekel had concluded, without philosophical or cosmological backdrop : Fear is the will to immortality . . . the immortal is the infinite. The infinite, however, is for us the inconceivable. And everything that is inconceivable is a source of fear. ... In the narrowest sense, fear is aversion to death. Every fear is fear of death. . . . 'Fear is the prolongation of life,' says Leonardo da Vinci. Fear is really only the longing for its prolongation. What is the counterpart of fear? Möbius calls fear the most important manifestation of the self-preservation instinct. The opposite is, however, the desire for annihilation, the death impulse or the longing for death. The more important is the sex instinct, perhaps the power which will exert itself to insure the immortality of the species if one wishes to think teleologically. Fear, dread of destruction, and the sex instinct, the longing for creation cannot be separated. Both appear in company with the death impulse. Dying and living are equivalent factors in the great symbolic equation of the infinite.10 Freud blithely ignores the precious insights of Stekel, indeed disparages them. He insists on the It's belief in its own immortality. The id knows no precautions to insure survival and no anxiety; or it would perhaps be more correct to say that, though it can produce the sensory elements of anxiety, it cannot make use of them . . . The id obeys the inexorable pleasure principle. . . . The considera tion that the pleasure principle requires a reduction, or perhaps ultimately the extinction, of the tension of the instinctual needs</page><page sequence="8">30 Imago (that is, a state of Nirvana) leads to problems that are still unexamined in the relations between the pleasure prinicple and the two primal forces, Eros and the death instinct.11 Instead of perceiving in the death drive the antagonist, the eliminator of the It, and instead of viewing life as an effort to evade this obliteration, Freud stresses that "all the organic instincts are conservative, are acquired historically, and tend toward the restoration of the earlier state of things." If we are to take it as truth that knows no exception, that every thing living dies for internal reasons—becomes inorganic once again—then we shall be compelled to say that 'the goal of all life is death' and, looking backwards, that 'what was inanimate existed before what is living.' Freud then develops the popular scientific belief that animate life stems from inanimate matter, ascribing its birth to "the action of a force of whose nature we can form no conception."12 Biologically he errs when he claims that in the earliest development of life from inanimate matter "it was still an easy matter at that time for a living substance to die." Actual ly, the earlier stages of life manifest a hardier disposition than the later stages, and the amoeba is to all eyes and microscopes as immortal as life can conceivably be. Freud does take up the question of unicellular immortality and tentatively accepts the findings of certain biologists to the effect that if not properly treated and fed such creatures will die a form of natural death. He begs the issue, however, by stating that no purpose can possibly be served by trying to solve the problem of natural death from a study of protozoa. "The primitive organization of these creatures may conceal from our eyes important conditions which, though in fact present in them too, only become visible in higher animals where they are able to find morphological expression."13 Since he starts with a premise that life itself had been sepa rated from inorganic matter in a pristine castration, he con templates the return of life to inorganic matter as a part of a circle such as Nietzsche, Vico, and pre-Platonic Greek sages had described. Suppose we assume in Freud's footsteps that the It had no reason to fear death, since restoration to its matrix is its fate and all that might befall something like Pythagorean</page><page sequence="9">Thanatopsis: Life's Last Stand SI metempsychosis; therefore the immediate maintenance of a specific form should be of no great concern to the It. From this premise it must follow that only the Ego would be affected by the alteration in the organism which is called death. Only the Ego would protest against it, only the Ego would fear it. The It, conceiving itself as immortal, resident without beginning and without end in a closed circle, cannot be presumed to identify itself too closely with the house it presently occupies. If, for the sake of discussion, we assume that in the beginning there existed nothing but organic matter, which over the millennia has been dying, changing into inorganic matter unreclaimably, then we may conceive that the terror of death lies within the It itself and that the Ego merely manifests its creator's concern with extinction. We have now exchanged in our thinking a closed circle for a direct linear decline, organic matter passing into inorganic matter whence there is absolutely no return or recall, no future, nothing but oblivion and annihilation—nox perpetua una dormienda. The ramification of this is easy to perceive. We have now established ourselves on the rampart of poetic insight which has often declared man's fear of death to be based upon his well-known reactionary attitude toward the unknown. "It is the undiscover'd country whom whose bourn no traveler re turns." No traveler has returned for a very simple reason; namely, nobody has ever actually gone there as a traveler, but instead has run down as energy does into heat. Living mole cules descend into the inferno or hell of non-living matter. It is precisely the fear of this unknown that dictates life shall endure the punishments that only living can bestow. Life itself thus becomes, as Nietzsche said, cowardice and disease. One might say that life eventually constitutes a form of cancer in its universe, although it originally was the entire universe, and at this final stage life has no destination but destruction. We see life operating in the same manner as cancer, creating larger units than unicellular combinations. The amoeba, prob ably the most efficient form of life and possibly the highest form of life, since it most nearly achieved the perfect environ ment, enjoys the nearest semblance of immortality as an indi viduum. Multi-cellular life, achieved at first by the simple</page><page sequence="10">32 Imago process of attaching other one-celled creatures in a composite (one almost said compost), thus emerges as an attempt to regain lost individual vitality at the expense of a group. We may well inquire, under the terms of this eschato logical exegesis, what happened to the original cosmic body of organic matter which shattered into individual life forms doomed to death? What set it into motion, presupposing it to have been in a Nirvana state of continence or repose? Empedocles postulated a "destructive" element, Neikos, the devil within which tore it asunder and wages never-ending war upon it. Under our view, the original enormous Sphairos gave birth to varied life forms in order to vanquish the nothingness surrounding it, driven by a will to power, an abhorrence of void. But this effort could not succeed and nothingness penetrated into the very heart of the living mat ter. By shaping forms, life gave birth to death, and as the original cosmic egg expelled her young on their dreadful mission of combating nullity, so too her epigones thrust out new life forms to meet death in a never-ending fall from the grace of the primordial Nirvana. In a sense, then, life is the giving of form, putting an end to a thing in order to destroy it. The Talmud holds that the finite is evil, which can be interpreted as that which has form must die. Empedocles piously postulated a continuum of Philotes or Philia and Neikos : As they were formerly, so also will they be, and never, I think, shall infinite Time be emptied of these two. (Frag. 16)14 If we consider what the philosopher-poet meant by Neikos, we may, however, draw closer to our own Weltanschauung. The root of the word Neikos, generally translated as Strife or Hatred, reached into the earliest memories of mankind, the nx, mx, nchs, sounds. Every beginning has a beginning, human ratiocination assumes. The Egyptians placed it in Nut, which may have been spoken as Nutz or the Greek Nux, the Latin Nox, that is the fearful Night encompassing all matter. The NK sound exists also in the Egyptian aNKh, the symbol of life everlasting, a negation of the nothingness of NK itself. From aNKh came the Greek aNXios, Latin aNXius, German angst and our own "anxiety," a perilous conjugation from life, i.e., anti-nothingness. In Sanskrit aNKh and naNKh sig</page><page sequence="11">Thanatopsis: Life's Last Stand 33 nify to move or go, while iNG means to agitate. The Greeks associated the NK root with the dread Goddess AnaNKe, necessity, that which could not be withstood. We may then state that Neikos originally devolved from the most difficult of human expressions, nothingness, expressed in the German nichts. We find it impossible to conceive of that idea, repre senting it as a state, a force, even personifying it in our dis cussions as almost anthropomorphic, as in the god Chaos, the physicists' gas. By naming it, we seek to render it harmless. But the initial and continuing struggle was between that which is and that which is not, that which has being and that which has not, life against nothing. In a large sense there exists no conflict: life cannot survive the nothingness which confronts it. At best, if we follow Heraclitus and Einstein, and see in the primordial life mass a moving substance, since a major attribute of life is motion, we need not query what began the splintering of the Sphairos : it was already engaged in activity from inception. Nevertheless, its activity would be directed solely to maintain its being against the non-being which surrounded and pene trated it. One can hardly designate so one-sided an issue as a conflict, despite the optimistic tenet of Empedocles and Freud that Eros and Thanatos do collide. Actually, within the frame work of the cosmos, Thanatos is meaningless, Eros helpless. Life simply tries to ward off the nothingness which aims at its obliteration. When, in Norse mythology, Wotan seeks to place in the hands of the heroes Siegmund and Siegfried the most potent of weapons, he chooses to grant them the power to wield the sword Nothung, nothing, the ultimate in de struction. In a large sense, there existed no dialectic, no two-some like Philia and Neikos, only is and is not, with the certainty of victory for the latter. What never was can never become, ex nihilo, nihil; what was can, however, pass into nullity, absorbed by the dreadful nox perpetua of Catullus. Modern natural science, while in the main supporting the mechanistic view upheld by Freud, nevertheless affords testi mony favoring the concept of life as integral to all matter. The Vitalist theory of Hans Driesch and his school maintained this opinion; nor has it been successfully refuted. Alexis</page><page sequence="12">34 Imago Carrel's work in the immortality of tissue supplied strong evidence for the potentiality that unicellular life forms are superior to man despite Darwinistic optimism, if our criterion be which form is closest to individual immortality. In a sense, the It has constructed larger and larger combinations, includ ing its last, best hope, man, in a vain endeavor to ward off death. The organic has steadily deteriorated with struggles to a point where in a universe of inorganic material it seeks defenses in irrational construction of unwieldy life forms to assault and destroy its dead body, the inorganic. Man may represent a last stand, an attempt to destroy nothingness, to ravage the universe, and, like Frankenstein, artificially to create living forms from dead atoms. But even the Franken stein dream of discovering a technique to stop the Todestrieb will have its end. Mach es kurz ! Am jüngsten Tag ist' nur ein Furz!14 Sidney Halpern Philadelphia NOTES 1. Empedocles, Frag. 125 in H. Diels, Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, 10th edition, ed. W. Kranz (1961) 1.362. We have, in our translation, replaced the pronoun "he" with the more indefinite "it" because Empedocles undoubtedly had a force rather than a deity in mind. 2. Genesis, 3.19. Freud himself revealed a painful consciousness of "dirt" as the essence of life in his anecdote about his mother rubbing dead skin from her hand to demonstrate our inception in the "dust" of the Bible. When I was six years old and was given my first lessons by my mother, I was expected to believe that we were all made of earth and must therefore return to earth. This did not suit me and I expressed doubts of the doctrine. My mother thereupon rubbed the palms of her hands together . . . and showed me the blackish scales of epidermis produced by the friction as a proof that we were made of earth. My astonishment at this ocular demonstration knew no bounds and I acquiesced in the belief which I was later to hear expressed in the words: 'Du bist der Natur einen Tod schuldig.' Sigmund Freud, The Interpretation of Dreams, tr. John Strachey (1961) 205. Thus Freud accepted, against his own infantile insight, the prevail ing Jewish viewpoint that life stemmed from death, thither to return. His conditioning came from his beloved mother whose trickery he accepted as truth, and left unchallenged. 3. Sandor Ferenczi, Thalassa, A Theory of Genitality, tr. H. A. Bunker, (1938) 94-5. This in brief restates the case as outlined by Empedocles whose teachings were familiar to Freud and his followers as trans</page><page sequence="13">Thanatopsis: Life's Last Stand 35 mitted by Freud's mentor and friend, Theodor Gomperz. See the latter's Greek Thinkers: A History of Ancient Philosophy, tr. L. Magnus, (1901) 1.227-254. When Freud felt constrained to defend his theory of instincts by recourse to prior authority, he lamented: I am well aware that the dualistic theory, according to which an instinct of death, destruction or aggression claims equal partner ship with Eros as manifested in libido, has meet with little general acceptance and has not really established itself even among psycho analysts. He then confesses that Empedocles of Acragas, the Parmenidean epigone, held priority: My delight was proportionately great when I recently discovered that the theory was held by one of the great thinkers of ancient Greece. For the sake of this configuration I am happy to sacrifice the prestige of originality, especially as I read so widely in earlier years that I can never be quite certain that what I thought was a creation of my own mind may not really have been an outcome of cryptomnesia. (CP 5.348). Freud qualifies his debt to Empedocles in so irresolute a fashion as to reveal once again how difficult he found it to concede precedence to another: The theory of Empedocles which specifically claims our attention is one which approximates so closely to the psycho-analytical theory of the instincts that we should be tempted to maintain that the two are identical were it not for this difference: the Greek's theory is a cosmic phantasy, while our own confines its application to biology. At the same time, the fact that Empedocles ascribed to the whole universe the same animistic principle as is manifested in each individual organism makes this difference considerably less important. The Greek philosopher taught that there were two principles governing events in the life of the universe as in that of the mind. . . . The two fundamental principles of Empedocles— philia (love) and neikos (strife)—are both in name and function, the same as our two primal instincts, Eros and Destruetiveness (CP. 5.349-50). Freud then boasts that his own construction has a scientific validity as apposed to Empedocles' "phantasy" because "we now have a cer tain biological basis for the principle of 'strife,' since we have traced back the destructive instinct to the death instinct, the urge of animate matter to return to an inanimate state." (Ibid., 350). This Freud wrote in 1937. Thirty years before, in 1907, Freud had included among his list of "ten good books," which he defined as those "which one has enjoyed and glady recommends to others" this same detailed study by Theodor Gomperz, Professor of Philology at at the University of Vienna, Griechische Denker. (E. Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud, 3.421-2). Freud had acted as Gomperz' protege in translating, under the lat ter's aegis, in 1880, a book by John Stuart Mill, part of which dealt with Plato. (Jones, 1.55-6.) Subsequently Freud had occasion to treat as a patient Gomperz' wife, Elise, to whom in 1900 he applied for a patronage favor. (Jones, 1.340). See Freud's letter of March 11, 1902 in Sigmund Freud, The Origins of Psycho-Analysis, (1954) 343. Further details of Freud's personal relations with Gomperz can be found in P. Merlan, "Brentano and Freud," J. Hist. Ideas, 6 (1945) 375-77, and in S.
