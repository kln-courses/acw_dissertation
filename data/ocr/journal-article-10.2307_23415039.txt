<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUMMARIES I. Thought and Halakha Haggai Ben-Shammai Sacadya's Introduction to Daniel: An Essay on the Calculation of the End of Days according to Prophecy against the Speculations of Astrologers and Magicians In this article almost the full text of Sa'adya's introduction to his Judaeo Arabic commentary on Daniel is published for the first time with an annotated Hebrew translation. The text is based on two long fragments (St. Petersburg, Russian National Library, Antonin 476; Cambridge University Library, T-S Ar. 33.33) and two short ones (Oxford, Bodl. 2486, fol. 1 [previously published in J. Qâfih's edition]; Cambridge University Library, T-S Ar. 26.54 [previously published by Y. Ratzaby]). For much of the text there are at least two witnesses. A central theme of the introduction is Sa'adya^ discussion of astrology. He discusses it in connection with the question of the ability of human beings to know the future. According to Sa'adya, the future cannot be known by human means since all human knowledge is based on sense perception. The claim of astrologers to know the future through scientific methods is flawed because astrology has no scientific validity. Astrology is based on historical experience, not on sound theoretical principles. In this fundamental characteristic it is very similar to "lower" kinds of non-scientific magic. The only legitimate and true means to know the future is prophecy, which is revealed by God, who is omniscient. The prophecy that is particularly aimed</page><page sequence="2">VIII SUMMARIES at conveying to the Jewish people the pattern of the End of Days is the Book of Daniel. Like other introductions of Sa'adya to biblical books, this one too has a distinct polemic aspect. In the Geonic period many Jews in the East were attracted to astrology, and some of them contributed considerably to its development. Many astrological works in Arabic had been associated with the name Daniel, thus confusing the legendary figure of a magician of that name with the biblical character, who was for Sa'adya a true prophet. Deeming this trend very dangerous to basic Jewish beliefs, Sa'adya set out to refute - with its own means and on its own terms - what had been presented as pure science. His goal was to draw a sharp distinction between his version of rabbinic Judaism rephrased in Judaeo-Arabic in accordance with contemporary scientific achievements on the one hand, and complete assimilation of Jews in the cultural environment on the other. To do so he acquired a firsthand acquaintance with the basic terminology and theories of astrology, as is well reflected in his discussion. Sa'adya's seems to be the earliest systematic refutation of astrology by a Jewish medieval thinker, and one of the earliest such statements in Arabic literature in general. Alfred Ivry Maimonides' Relation to the Teachings of Averroes The lives of the twelfth-century contemporaries Maimonides and Averroes bear many similarities, particularly in their philosophical beliefs. Averroes is known in the history of philosophy as a radical Aristotelian, a reputation based largely upon his numerous commentaries on Aristotle's texts. In his independent works too, Averroes upholds the banner of Aristotelian naturalism against both the Neoplatonic incursions advanced by Avicenna and the anti-scientific occasionalist teachings of the Mutakallimun, as represented by al-GhazâlT.</page><page sequence="3">SUMMARIES IX Maimonides too saw the proponents of Kalâm as a formidable challenge that had to be countered, and he did so through confidence in the rectitude of essentially Aristotelian teachings. His commitment to science is to a body of knowledge as described primarily by Aristotle. In contrast to his predecessors, Maimonides endorses Aristotelian philosophy above any other school of thought, minimizing explicitly the Neoplatonic teachings of his predecessors. This, however, did not deter him from adopting some of these teachings in modified form at various crucial junctures where Aristotle failed him. Consistent with his philosophy, Averroes believed that the only immortal part of a person was the rational faculty, and that the accumulated wisdom amassed in a lifetime belonged to universal truth, there being no durability to any individuals intellect. This doctrine is known as "monopsychism". Another charge often leveled against Averroes, though with less justifications, was that of a "double truth" doctrine. This is the view that two opposing views may be asserted with equal sincerity, a doctrine few people accepted as sincere. It has escaped the attention of many readers of The Guide of the Perplexed, Maimonides' magnum opus, that he there endorses, albeit almost in passing, a version of the doctrine of monopsychism. This is in apparent contradiction to his remarks in his rabbinic writings about the survival of souls in the afterlife - an apparent example of "double truth". Such contradictory positions may be explained by the political teachings to which both Averroes and Maimonides subscribed, teachings that had their origin in Plato and his medieval incarnation, al-Fârâbl. Maimonides and Averroes differ considerably in their attempts to acquaint their coreligionists with their philosophical understanding of God and his relation to the world. Maimonides is the less prudent of the two, as well as the more dedicated to this task, his philosophy assuming thereby an existential dimension.</page><page sequence="4">SUMMARIES Aluma Solnik-Dankowitz On the Life and Teachings of the Mystic Hatim al־Asamm: An Example of Sufi Anecdotes in Jewish Sources Muslim mysticism has influenced the spiritual world of the Jews, both rabbinic and Karaite. Evidence for the Jewish interest in Sufi sources is the central Sufi treatises found in Jewish sources, along with anecdotes about Sufi teachers, including the Khurâsânï sheikh Hàtim al-Asamm (d. 237/851 2). Some of these anecdotes are in Arabic written in Hebrew characters and are included in the private manuscript collection of a Karaite family from Damascus; one tradition, written in NaskhT Arabic script, comes from the Jewish Geniza. In examining the traditions about al-Asamm in these sources, and comparing them with the Arabic and Persian sources about him, we see that on one level or another the Jewish community was also exposed to him and his ideas. His main ideas are: (a) strict observance of religious precepts; (b) absolute reliance on God (tawakkul), particularly in a deterministic perception of "one's daily bread" (rizq) which God provides; (c) constant anticipation of death and planning for it (qisar al-amal)] and (d) constant awareness of God's unceasing supervision over man (murâqaba). The aim of this article is to present an example of Sufi anecdotes preserved and studied by the Jewish community, and to examine how they reflect Hâtim al-Asamm's image and spiritual world as they are known to the Muslim public.</page><page sequence="5">SUMMARIES XI Joseph Rivlin The Development of the Institution of Shiddukhin (Matchmaking) in Light of Geniza Documents The article discusses the development of the institution of shiddukhin in Jewish law. In the Talmuds it is already recommended to precede the entire wedding process with shiddukhin. However, both the Talmudic and Gaonic sources lead us to believe that shiddukhin had no legal validity. Only toward the end of the Gaonic period did the institution grow stronger, partly as a result of fines being imposed on whichever side abrogated the agreement and refused to go through with the marriage. This reinforcement was related to the unification of the ceremonies of betrothal and marriage that began at this time. The article deals with a number of questions that arose because of the aforementioned change in the institution of shiddukhin - e.g. (a) What is the background to these changes? (b) What caused the lack of clarity with regard to the meaning of the word erusinl (c) Why did the problem of asmakhta regarding fines on the abrogation of matches arise only about a century after they were instituted? The institution of shiddukhin probably derives from delays in the ceremonies of betrothal and marriage. The sources point out that certain changes caused a separation of the two processes, shiddukhin and qiddushin, which evidently had several consequences: (a) Until these changes, both shiddukhin and qiddushin were subsumed under the term erusin, but when they were separated each process was ascribed that name or it was ascribed to the other process, according to the circumstance, (b) When the two were separated, fears arose that giving money to the bride in the event of shiddukhin would create a marital link between the bride and the bridegroom, possibly causing the bride to be regarded as a married woman. Consequently the payment was transformed into a commitment to pay, creating, in turn, the problem of asmakhta. Solutions proposed for these problems complement each other and have created a more complex picture of the institution of matchmaking.</page><page sequence="6">XII SUMMARIES David Henshke Maimonides as His Own Commentator This article examines a unique instance in which Maimonides interpreted his own words in Mishneh Tor ah. He twice explained a particular ruling that appears in the Laws of the Sabbath: once in a responsum to Baghdad and a second time in a responsum to Provence toward the end of his life. However the two responsa differ and provide conflicting interpretations. A careful analysis of all the sources reveals that Maimonides actually changed his mind regarding the issue involved. This change is documented in variations of the text of Mishneh Torah - as it appears in the first version of the work and as it was corrected by Maimonides himself in the later version. The article also reconstructs the Talmudic background to Maimonides5 change of opinion. From this it may be concluded that the ruling regarding which Maimonides was consulted was first based on his earlier opinion, as found in the first version of Mishneh Torah. Consequently his ruling was clear and unambiguous, and the first responsum reflects this understanding. However, after Maimonides changed his mind regarding the issue, as reflected in the later version of Mishneh Torah, the ruling regarding which he was consulted had become irrelevant. It is concluded that in his second responsum Maimonides justified his ruling in Mishneh Torah, but not on the basis of the original arguments, and consequently there is a degree of hesitation in this responsum. The reconstruction suggested by this article presents a new aspect of Maimonides' dynamic thinking-creative interpretation of his own words.</page><page sequence="7">SUMMARIES XIII II. History and Society Nahem Ilan 'Let not the Rich Men Glory in his Riches" (Jeremiah 9:22) - Implied Social Criticism in the Commentary of Rabbi Israel Israeli to Avot Rabbi Israel Israeli, one of the most important scholars in the Jewish community of Toledo at the turn of the 14th century, wrote a long commentary in Judaeo-Arabic on the Avot tractate, based partly on his sermons. The first part of this article deals with the sermon as a literary genre and the methodological problems of inquiring sermons. The second part is a brief characterization of the commentary. The third part - which is the centrepiece of this essay - presents a social criticism that derives from the commentary, especially against greed and the suitable use of money. R. Israel dealt at length with the unsuitable use of money in two contexts: when he interpreted Hillel's words "More property - more anxiety" (2, 7) and when he expounded to R. Shimon on "The borrower who does not repay" (2, 9). The article includes a brief discussion of R. Israel's attitude to charity as a worthy use of property. The appendix comprises an annotated translation of five sections of R. Israel's commentary. A critical reading of R. Israel's commentary adds a particular flavour to the wealth of detail discovered by Prof. Yom Tov Assis. The position of R. Israel, in essay form and in its original character (as a sermon), uncovers an additional arena of confrontation with the Jewish community in Toledo at the turn of the 14th century, its problems and challenges. Besides the judicial aspect (as reflected in Spanish archives and rabbinic responsa), R. Israel and his colleagues dealt with these problems and challenges in a pedagogic way as well. The power of the pedagogue is greater than that of the judge, because the latter deals only with facts whereas the educator aims to change the mental approach and fashion a different shape.</page><page sequence="8">XIV SUMMARIES Yaron Ben-Naeh Poverty, Paupers and Poor Relief in Ottoman Jewish Society This article describes poverty in Jewish Ottoman society as well as that society's treatment of the poor. Jewish society in the large urban centres of the Ottoman Empire was class-oriented, with a large sector of poor being at the margins of society, barely surviving on their daily income or on charity. Poverty was more than just an economic-material situation; it had clear cultural and social implications. The difficult life of the poor formed the background to Jewish public life. Community care of the poor, either direct or indirect, voluntary or compulsory, was greatly assisted by the confraternal societies, whose popularity grew steadily, and by benevolent individuals. The purpose of communal and individual charity was neither the eradication of poverty nor concern for the spiritual welfare of the poor. Charity did not arise out of desire to change the social structure and create greater economic parity; rather it aimed at preventing death from starvation or sickness. Jewish communal leadership considered itself obligated to provide at least a minimal level of welfare for the community's poor and allocated considerable resources for this purpose. This stand emanated from Jewish tradition and heritage, and was affected by the cultural atmosphere, mentality and behaviourial patterns of Ottoman city dwellers in general, who treated poverty as an inherent and natural social phenomenon. Most important was the recompense to the giver - personal prestige and heavenly reward. Without declaring so, community philanthropy was intended to preserve and strengthen the existing social order, as well as the traditional values of Jewish society. It helped preserve the unity of the community and promoted a high degree of internal solidarity.</page><page sequence="9">SUMMARIES XV David Yerushalmi Jews of the Ottoman Empire and the Jewish Communities of Iran in the Nineteenth Century: Background and Trends The establishment of the Safavid empire in Iran in 1501 marks a major turning point in Iranian history. The ideological and institutional changes enacted by the Safavids, chief among them the introduction of the Shi'i creed as the state religion of Iran, were to have a lasting and progressively detrimental effect on the general standing and living conditions of the religious minorities of Iran. Among the three main groups of religious minorities in 19th-century Iran (Christians of various denominations, Zoroastrians and Jews) the position of the Jews was particularly precarious. Consisting of an estimated twenty thousand souls in the mid-19th century, the Jews of Iran were highly dispersed, living in relatively small concentrations in a large number of towns and provincial settlements in the midst of a predominantly Shi'i population. Due to numerous causes, the Jews of Iran had undergone a considerable demographic decline since the late 17th century. In addition to their sharp demographic decline, Jews (much like Zoroastrians) were subjected to the numerous legal, social and occupational restrictions rooted in Shi'i law. They were subjected to various degrees of physical and psychological abuse, forced or induced conversion to Islam, as well as extortions, collective punishments and pogroms perpetrated by the mob. These conditions constituted the general background for a broad range of contacts between the Jews of the Ottoman Empire and the Jewish communities of Iran. The material examined for this article indicates that during this period most contacts between the two communities took place in two geographical areas of Ottoman territory. The first consisted of the Jewish communities of Istanbul and Palestine (i.e. Jerusalem, Hebron, Tiberias and Safed). The second area, which had closer and far more complex ties with the Jews of Iran, consisted of southern Iraq, particularly the Jewish communities of Baghdad and Basra. In both regions the relations reflected the influence and the advantageous position enjoyed by the</page><page sequence="10">XVI SUMMARIES Ottoman Jews as compared to the Jews of Iran. Their comparative strength, in particular that of the Jews of Iraq, enabled them to extend diverse moral, humanitarian and material assistance to the hard-pressed Jews of Iran (especially during the second half of the 19th century). In addition to Jewish Ottoman involvement in numerous confidential and public matters on behalf of Iranian Jews, rabbis and religious emissaries from the main Jewish settlements of Palestine regularly visited the Jewish communities of Iran on various missions. As for the Jews of Iraq, their relations and involvement with (and on behalf of) the Jews of Iran were extensive and highly personal.</page><page sequence="11">SUMMARIES XVII III. Poetry Tova Be'eri ־Eli He-Haver ben 'Amram: A Hebrew Poet in Eleventh Century Egypt 'Eli ben cAmram he-Haver ha-Me(ulleh, the widely documented communal leader of the Jerusalemite congregation in Fustat, was also a prolific poet. He composed some forty secular poems, including elegies and dirges, and as many piyyutim (liturgical poems). All his writings were recovered from the Cairo Geniza. Many of his secular poems are panegyrics, at times accompanying long, flowery-styled letters. These were penned to distinguished persons of his time, usually in the hope of receiving their political and/or financial support. Among &lt;Eli's famous addressees are Shemuel ha-Nagid and his son Yehoseph of Spain, Abu Sa'd al-Tustari and Yehuda ben Sacadya ha-Nagid of Egypt, Daniel ben 'Azarya Gaon and others. Additional poems are addressed to various important people whom I was not able to identify with certainty. A great number of (Eli's texts have come down to us as holographic drafts written on the back of expired documents. His liturgical texts deserve far greater literary recognition than his secular poems. The former are variegated: they contain a large number of selihot (penitential poems) as well as classical piyyutim such as kerovot of various kinds. In his poems 'Eli tries to imitate the Spanish school of Hebrew poetry, writing in mono-rhymed lines and using quantitative meter (ha-merubbe). The article surveys 'Eli's literary output and evaluates his achievement in this field. The question of the Spanish school's influence on 'Eli's writings is also examined. Fifteen of his poems (both secular and liturgical) are appended to demonstrate various aspects of his literary activity.</page><page sequence="12">XVIII SUMMARIES IV. Bible Exegesis and Massorah Miriam Goldstein The Structural Function of Biblical Superfluity in the Exegesis of the Karaite Yusuf ibn Nuh The Arabic commentary on the Pentateuch written by Yusuf ibn Nuh, a 10th-century Karaite grammarian and exegete, demonstrates an interesting approach to repetition in the Bible that bridges between the principle of omnisignificance widespread in the midrash, on the one hand, and the claim of arbitrary superfluity found in later medieval exegesis, on the other. In this approach, repetition contributes to the structure of the biblical narrative by providing formal features that reflect and emphasize aspects of the plain meaning. Repetitive elements and formulaic phrases signal thematic distinctions to the reader. Ibn Nuh's interpretation of repetition forms part of his general approach to exegesis and is common to the Karaite exegetes of the 10th and 11th centuries; it emphasizes explanation of the structure of the narrative as a basic and necessary element in biblical commentary. Statements by ibn Nuh,s contemporaries suggest that in addition to providing solutions to exegetical problems, such structural explanations are intended to serve as evidence for the well-ordered and elegant nature of the biblical text. These explanations and claims may stem from an increased awareness of writing style and the emphasis on beauty of expression that characterized the Abbasid and post-Abbasid environment of the East, and may even be a response to the Muslim assertion of the inimitability of the Qur'ân.</page><page sequence="13">SUMMARIES XIX Tzvi Avni Balaam's Poetic Verses in the Commentary of Yefet ben cEli the Karaite This paper contains a critical edition of the commentary of Yefet ben 'Eli the Karaite on Numbers 23:1-24:25, based on six manuscripts. Yefet was born in Basra, Iraq, the dates of his birth and death being unknown. His major activities took place in the last quarter of the 10th century. He lived in Jerusalem for a long period, perhaps until his death. Yefet wrote his translation and commentary in Judaeo Arabic. This part of the commentary is believed to have been written in the year 968, at the latest. It includes linguistic peculiarities that were probably not previously recorded. The translation initiated some deviations from classical Arabic in the fields of morphology and syntax, and created unusual idioms. In terms of semantics, some words are given an unusual or unknown meaning. The part discussed here reflects some of Yefet's theological doctrines. The commentary seeks to follow the plain meaning of the biblical text - although sometimes extending it for theological reasons, for example to avoid anthropomorphism. There is a remarkable resemblance between Yefet's sources and rabbinic sources, which seem to have influenced his translation and his exegesis. Within this part of the commentary we find a semi-political comment which may indicate that Yefet regarded his period as close to the end of days. In this context he describes dramatic events of the approaching Day of Judgement.</page><page sequence="14">XX SUMMARIES Sagit Butbul The Commentary of Yefet ben (Eli the Karaite on the Book of Ruth Yefet ben Eli, who lived in Jerusalem during the second half of the 10th century and beginning of the eleventh, is one of the foremost Karaite Bible exegetes. Yefet translated and commented upon the entire Hebrew Bible. That his works continued to have an impact on later generations is evident from the numerous posthumous copies of his commentaries. The British Library in London houses a unique collection of Karaite manuscripts, including a series of twenty biblical manuscripts written in Arabic characters and containing the Arabic commentaries of Yefet ben cEli. One of these, MS BL Or. 2554, contains Yefet's translation and commentary on the Book of Ruth and the Song of Songs. According to the colophon, this particular manuscript was copied in Ramla in the year 395 A.H. (= 1004/5 A.D.), during Yefet's lifetime. This article presents a complete edition of Yefet's translation and commentary on the Book of Ruth, accompanied by an annotated Hebrew translation and a glossary of the rare terms and phrases found in the commentary. The edition is based on manuscript BL Or. 2554 due to its significance and, primarily, its reliability. However, as this manuscript is not complete, other manuscripts were used in order to fill lacunae. The commentary is preceded by an introduction in which several topics are discussed at length. In addition to a survey of the rabbinic and Karaite sources used by Yefet, the introduction also includes a description of the various manuscripts that were used to complement Yefet's commentary and a survey of earlier studies devoted to Yefet's commentary on the Book of Ruth.</page><page sequence="15">SUMMARIES XXI Rafael Isaac (Singer) Zer Was the Masorete of the Aleppo Codex of Rabbinite or Karaite Origin? The debate over Aharon Ben-Asher's creed has persisted for nearly one and a half centuries. Binyamin Klar managed to read Ben-Asher's name in the heading of Sa'adia Ga'on's anti-Karaite poem Essa Meshali, which seemed to put an end to this debate. However, Aron Dotan then argued that the addressee of the poem is not the Masorete Ben-Asher but a different Ben Asher. Furthermore, Dotan posited that Maimonides' approval of the text of Ben-Asher indicates that Ben-Asher was indeed a Rabbinite. This paper refutes Dotan's argument and uncovers new evidence that the Masorete of the Aleppo Codex (either Ben-Asher or another) was Karaite. David Shemuel Lôwinger earlier sensed that several masora magna notes of the Aleppo Codex seemed Karaite, but he recognized neither their significance nor their implicit meaning. This paper brings to light Karaite notes expressing harsh criticism of Rabbinite belief in the Oral Law. The masorete of the Aleppo Codex drew these notes from contemporary Karaite biblical exegesis, in which Rabbinite polemics was a major issue. Such notes indicate that the Masorete of the Aleppo Codex was Karaite.</page></plain_text>
