Mitchell Department of Psychology, Department of Behavioral Biology and California Primate Research Center, University of California, Davis, California 95616 synopsis. Play among four pairs of adult male and infant rhesus monkeys is described and compared to mother-infant and peer play. Data were collected while the adult males reared the infants for a period of 7 months in the absence of mothers and peers. Types of play were categorized as solitary, parallel, and interactive. Sex differences in play patterns are described, as are antecedent and consequent events. Adult male-infant play was found to be of much greater intensity and mean duration than mother-infant play. INTRODUCTION Perhaps the figure most neglected by those who have studied the socialization of human and nonhuman primates has been the father or adult male. Explanations for this neglect are not difficult to come by. In many primate species, particularly our own, adult males have relatively infrequent con? tact with immature conspecifics. Moreover, the role of the mother in sustaining the very life of the neonate is often much more directly observable; the mother's impor? tance is reflected in the very name of the class of animals?Mammalia?in which we find ourselves. In the case of the rhesus monkey (Ma- caca mulatta L.), if one were to examine the relationships between adult males and infants observed in free-ranging groups, one would not find a great deal of positive social interaetion. Adult rhesus males in North India, for example, have been described as "neutral or indifferent" toward infants and juveniles (Southwick et al., 1965). Adult males also appear to show relatively little interest in neonates (Rowell et al., 1964), This research was supported by a National Sci? ence Foundation traineeship and by NIH grants MH22253, HD04335, and RR00169. We gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Edna Brandt, Jody Gomber, Linda Perry, Bruce Mulligan, and Bob Odom. although it would do well to keep in mind that rhesus mothers with newborns receive relatively little attention from other fe? males or infants either (Southwick et al., 1965). (One can contrast this pattern with that of baboons [Papio cynocephalus L.], in which group members of several sex and age classes are strongly attracted to mothers with newborns [Hall and DeVore, 1965].) Adult males frequently attack but only rarely associate peacefully with infants (Southwick et al., 1965; Lindburg, 1971). A male may piek up, bite, and throw an in? fant to the ground, especially while feed? ing. On only three occasions during a field study (Southwick et al., 1965) based on 762 hr of observations were infants seen to play and associate peacefully with adult males for substantial lengths of time. Males do occasionally defend infants from attack or threaten nearby animals while sitting close to infants. However, peaceful physical con? tact between males and infants is appar? ently rare; Lindburg (1971) only twice saw males carrying immature individuals dur? ing 900 hr of observation. On only two oc? casions did he see an adult male play with an infant. In Kaufmann's (1966) study of free-rang? ing monkeys on Cayo Santiago island, very similar types of interactions were observed. Adult males were never seen to approach 295</page><page sequence="2">296 William K. Redican and G. Mitchell infants. Infants several weeks of age, how? ever, occasionally approached, contacted, and even climbed on males. On 76% of such occasions the males' response was to ignore, withdraw from, threaten, hit, or grab the infants. On the remaining 24% of those occasions the males held the infants gently in their arms. Thus, if one were to characterize adult males in their relations with infants in free- ranging groups, they are in general indif- ferent, somewhat sensitive to approach and contact, occasionally aggressive, and rarely affiliative. However, an issue not directly addressed through observation of free- ranging groups is what potential the adult males may possess for affiliative parental responsiveness. It is well known that one of the most hazardous statements to make about an animal is that it does not exhibit a particular behavior. It is difficult to make such negative assertions because one does not have exhaustive access to the social and nonsocial situations in which an animal may find itself. However, if one were to ex- perimentally create an environment very dissimilar to a feral animal's habitat, one would be in a position to explore the ani? mal's unexpressed behavioral potential. To cite Kummer (1971, p. 139, 154) only slightly out of context, one would be inves- tigating the flexible aspects of an animal's adaptations, that is, the range of their mod? ifications; we are urged to "investigate the modification potential of a species to its very limits METHOD The first step in such an undertaking is to provide an animal with a reasonable op- portunity to display and develop a set of behaviors?in this case, male parental care. Spencer-Booth (1970, p. 122) noted that lack of attention by an individual (e.g., by an adult male toward an infant) "may not even refiect a difference in interest or the degree of 'maternal-ness' [or 'paternal- ness'] so much as a difference in oppor- tunity." One possibility is that the op- portunity for parental care is not often available to free-ranging rhesus males be- cause of the vigilant protectiveness of rhe? sus mothers toward their infants. Our general procedure, consequently, was to provide each of four adult feral-born rhesus males access to an infant over several months in the absence of the mother and peers. The males were 9 to 11 years old at the time of pairing. Some precaution was in order since infanticide has been reported in this (Carpenter, cited in Collias and Southwick, 1952) and other (Thompson, 1967) macaques as well as genera such as the langur (Presbytis) (Sugiyama, 1966; Rudran, 1973a,6). Familiarity between the male and infant appears to be an impor? tant factor affecting the likelihood of in? fanticide (Thompson, 1967). To familiarize each male with both the mother and in? fant, all three were initially housed together in a large (3 ft X 3 ft X 6 ft) laboratory cage. In two cases, the males were not pres? ent during the birth of the infants (one male and one female), and the mother- neonate pairs were separated from the males by a thick clear Plexiglas barrier. The males could see, hear, and possibly smell the mothers and infants but not touch them. In the remaining two cases, we were interested in the males* responsiveness to the birth of the infants (one male and one female) and no barrier was placed between the animals. To recapitulate, there are four different adult males, each housed with a different mother and infant. There are two male and two female infants, all born to multiparous feral-born mothers. (In none of the cases were the males the actual fathers of the in? fants. We were not concerned with paternal kinship in this study because it appears to be of little psychosocial consequence to the promiscuous rhesus monkey.) We considered a month to be sufficient time both for the animals to become famil? iar and for the infant to develop a reason- able degree of psychomotor coordination. At the end of one month the mother was removed. In all cases the infant was now separated from the male by the Plexiglas barrier to protect the infant and to enable it to learn to feed from a bottle without the male interfering.</page><page sequence="3">Adult Male-Infant Play 297 After the infant had been trained on the bottle for several days, the barrier between the male and infant was withdrawn. During the initial 10 min of contact, the infant was enclosed within a small stainless-steel cage as a final precaution against any aggression from the male. In none of the pairings did we observe any tendency toward aggression, and the infants were then allowed direct contact with the males. Each male-infant dyad was reared in a separate home cage while time-sampling data were taken over a period of 7 months. Detailed handwritten records were also made throughout the study. For a control group, we will refer to a group of four infants (two males and two females) that had been reared only by their feral-born multiparous mothers. These ani? mals had been reared under conditions as identical as possible to the ones in the pres? ent study, and the same data-taking scheme was utilized. RESULTS One of the most striking aspects of the male-infant interactions thus far has been the remarkable amount of play that has emerged. All four of the dyads began play- ing within 5 to 11 days after pairing. The frequency and intensity of this play far exceeded our expectations. In the remain- der of this paper we will describe the play patterns which emerged, compare them with mother-infant and peer pattern, delineate some sex differences in play, and relate play behaviors in some way to other behaviors such as aggression, sex, and grooming. Types of Play One way of organizing male-infant play patterns is in terms of three categories: soli? tary, parallel, and interactive play. This is similar to at least one classification of chil? dren's play (Mussen et al., 1963), but substi- tutes "interactive" for "cooperative." Solitary play. Not surprisingly, there was a great deal of solitary play by the infants. With due attention to the fact that explora- tion is very difficult to distinguish from play (Welker, 1971), especially solitary play, we include in this category such activities as jumping, swinging, running, climbing, and so forth. The male infants occasionally showed a playface while playing by them- selves, which demonstrates that this facial expression, unlike others such as a threat or lipsmack, is occasionally emitted in the ab? sence of a functional recipient of the dis? play. The playface may thus not always serve a metacommunicative function. Both male infants were also seen to mouth and to playbite themselves during solitary play, whereas only one female infant was seen to mouth herself on a single occasion. These two sex differences suggest that male soli? tary play is somewhat more intense than that of females. In addition to these motor forms of soli? tary play, there was also a considerable amount of object play in both male and female infants. In general this consisted of manipulating and swatting at objects such as food dishes, milk bottles, or relatively nonappealing remnants of food (e.g., an orange peel). Both the infants and adults usually interrupted any ongoing activity to pursue flying insects that happened within their reach. In view of the common finding that adults rarely engage in even interactive play (see, e.g., Dolhinow and Bishop, 1970), we were somewhat surprised at the appearanee of solitary play in the adult males. For exam? ple, after their water dishes were refilled the males would usually take a few sips of water and then immediately settle down to splashing and spilling the water, spin? ning the water dish around, and running their hands through the water. One male characteristically lifted the water dish up and then slowly and almost ceremoniously poured out the entire contents. On four oc? casions within 1 month, this same male held the bottom of the stainless-steel bowl at an acute angle to his face and then pivoted his trunk around in various directions. Appar? ently he was either using the shiny surface as a mirror or as a source of complex visual input. The solitary play of the adult males was not limited to objects. At least one motor</page><page sequence="4">298 William K. Redican and G. Mitchell pattern might be described as play: Two of the males occasionally jumped to the ceil- ing and swung back and forth while hold? ing on with both hands and both feet. The infants often responded to this behavior by jumping up near the males and grasping at them playfully. On some occasions the males did not reciprocate with play, but on other occasions this swinging occurred between or directly preceded bouts of play with the infants. Parallel play. The second major type of pattern was parallel play. By this we mean play activities which took place simultane- ously in both animals with little or no ap? parent interaetion. This form of play oc? curred rarely. For example, adult and infant might simultaneously play with separate food dishes. In one dyad the adult began to roll a loose bar of the cage between the palms of his hands. After watching the male for a few rrioments the infant sat near him and rolled another bar or the other end of the male's bar between his hands. This type of play seems closely related to in- stances in which first the male explored a particular object or area of the cage, and then the infant would do the same after the male had ceased the activity. For example, when one dyad was reintroduced to a cage with a relatively unfamiliar watering bottle, first the male drank while the infant ob? served from a few inches away. When the male stopped the infant immediately drank from the same spigot. This sequence was repeated at least five times within 30 min. Interactive play. By far the greatest amount of play in the adult male-infant dyads was interactive. A total of 150 inter? active play sessions were observed through? out the 7-month periods of rearing, which included approximately 250 hr of observa? tion. To put this in perspective, this fre? quency of play was approximately 200 times greater than that reported in the field studies cited previously (Southwick et al., 1965; Lindburg, 1971). There were sex differences in many as? pects of play. Male infants consistently played more frequently than did the female infants, accounting for 88 of the 150 play sessions, or 58.7% (P^.05, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test, scores ranked weekly). There is some consistency with other mea? surements. The percentage for duration of play, based on the time-sampling data (in units of 1/100 min), was almost identical to the percentage for frequency: 511 of a total of 860 units, or 59.4%, were attribut- able to the males. Similarly, the males were responsible for 58% of the total duration of physical contact. In terms of temporal pattern, the frequency of male-female play tended to decline over the 7 months of rear? ing, whereas in the case of male-male play it peaked in the later months (see Fig. 1). This agrees with reports (Millar, 1968, p. 90; Lindburg, 1971) that adult males tend to play with juveniles more frequently than with infants. While these sex differences are stable and exhibit some agreement between dif? ferent measures, the qualitative records of play sessions point to both sex differences and commonalities. Play involving the male infants was consistently more reciprocal, involving mutually vigorous clasping and play-biting. In contrast, the female infants often froze when clasped by the males and appeared to try to escape from the male's grasp more frequently and with a shorter latency. Moreover, in the male-female dyads the adult was much more likely to unilat- erally initiate play, whereas in the male- male dyads the infant usually instigated play by vigorous motor activity (which may or may not be directed toward the adult male), at some time during which the adult began to respond playfully to the infant. Regardless of the sex of the infant, play was highly episodic, a feature which calls to mind the common finding (see Loizos, 1967; Miller, 1973) that a prominent pat? tern in play is repetition. After an interval of intense clasping and play-biting, the in? fant typically began struggling to break away. This accomplished, it then usually ran to an area of the cage distant from the male. It would then sit on the floor or cling to the wall for a few moments, during which there was a great deal of mutual eye-to-eye contact, and occasional playfaces and swat- ting at each other. Typically the infant then jumped back toward the male, often at his</page><page sequence="5">Adult Male-Infant Play 299 201 16 &gt;? 12 z LU 3 O UJ cn 41 ?

The infants, therefore, were responsible for breaking and regaining contact much more frequently than the males. In this way they were probably capable of modulating their arousal levels within acceptable limits. One of the most complex descriptive topics has to do with initiation and termi- nation of play. Millar (1968, p.71, 99-100) concluded that one of the most universal events preceding play in both birds and mammals is some change in the environ? ment. Our observations are in general agree? ment: for example, several times the dyads played at the beginning of data sessions (i.e., when the observer had just entered the room and was setting up equipment); noise from adjoining rooms also occasionally pre? ceded play. The effects of such external stimuli, how? ever, are not cumulative. Once play has begun, the reception of a stimulus which might typically trigger play could also ter? minate it. These need not be particularly dangerous situations. For example, on some occasions the noise of a caretaker preceded play; on others it abruptly terminated it. In general, the environmental changes which preceded play, at least, seemed to moderately raise the arousal level of the animals. A similar function was apparently served by internal events, i.e., those within the dyad. One of the most recurrent of such events was a brief aggressive interaetion. Play is often said to merge into aggres? sion as it gets more and more intense (e.g., see Miller, 1973), but we typically observed the converse. On 22 occasions a brief ag? gressive clasp of the infant by the male pre? ceded rough-and-tumble play. In 14 other instances, the infants responded to aggres? sion from the male with a play face or play-</page><page sequence="6">300 William K. Redican and G. Mitchell ful clasp, but the male did not reciprocate. Similarly, Kaufmann (1966) found that in? fant rhesus monkeys slowly associated aver- sive consequences with threatening displays. It is a common statement that, despite prob? lems in arriving at a satisfactory definition of play, human observers have little diffi- culty in agreeing that particular behaviors are playful. Apparently young rhesus mon? keys, in contrast, often misperceive aggres? sive behavior of adult males. Another type of mildly arousing event within the dyad which often preceded play was highly energetic activity by the infant. Occasionally during periods of solitary climbing, jumping, and swinging by the infant the adult male might suddenly turn, clasp the infant while displaying a playface, and play would begin. Often the infants incorporated the males into their activity by jumping toward them, swatting at them while dangling from the ceiling, and grab- bing at the heels of the males while follow? ing them. This type of activity was seen to precipitate reciprocal play on 22 occasions; on 28 occasions the adults did not overtly respond and on 8 occasions they responded with brief aggressive clasps. It would be less than accurate to state that a homogenous set of events invariably preceded play. On four occasions the male's grooming of the infant led to play, which is somewhat surprising since grooming tends to reduce arousal levels. On nine occasions the infant's persistent manipulation (both manual and oral) of the male preceded play. The males often tolerated the infants as they took remarkable liberties: standing, bouncing, and thrusting on the heads of the males; pulling on their lips, teeth, and tongue; and clasping, mouthing, and pull? ing handfuls of fur and skin. This type of activity typically merged into play-biting by the infant. Other types of play initiation defy classi? fication. For example, one of the male in? fants, 4 months of age at the time, had been awakened by the arrival of a caretaker, which disrupted his afternoon period of sleep. He was geckering and cooing repeat- edly, closely following the adult male, who was shifting his position in the cage every few seconds. The adult male clasped the infant aggressively, which intensified his vo? calization considerably. After another shift in position the adult looked steadily at the infant for several seconds, reached over suddenly and pulled the infant toward him? self. Play lasted for exactly 30 see, at which time the adult ceased to respond. After this play the infant sat calmly and no longer emitted distress vocalizatipns. It is tempt- ing to attribute anthropomorphic inten- tional motives to the male for instigating play at that particular moment in order to cahn the infant. At best one might conjec- ture that the infant's vocalization somewhat raised the male's arousal level, as in other classes of antecedent events. The termination of play sessions was in large part regulated by the adult males. Toward the end of a session the adult males typically became less reciprocal and re? mained inactive when the infants jumped at them. The infants often persevered in vigorous motor activity after the males ceased to respond. In 10 cases this activity was not oriented toward the males; in 6 cases this activity at least occasionally in? volved the males but no aggression oc? curred; but in 11 cases the infants contin- ued to clasp, play-bite, and swat at the adults and were briefly aggressed 1 or 2 min after the male had ceased to play. In this limited sense, play did lead to aggres? sion. In all such cases it was unilateral, very abbreviated, and almost always abruptly ter? minated playful activities by the infants. In this sense it can be differentiated from peer play, which occasionally leads to prolonged bouts of aggression. Moreover, on six of the eight occasions in which an infant screeched while playing with an adult male, play ceased within seconds. On the two occasions in which play did not cease, the infant was 8 months old and thus relatively more adept at very vigorous activity. At all other times, play was remakably silent, except for occa- sional low-intensity barks by the adult males. Activities following play suggest that adults and infants differ in their readiness to diminish their arousal level. On eight oc? casions the males groomed themselves after play, an activity which in infants was never</page><page sequence="7">Adult Male-Infant Play 301 seen to follow play. Infants in general con? tinued highly energetic activity. The in? fants thus were inclined to continue play for much longer intervals than were the males. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION We are able to make some comparisons between mother-infant play and adult male- infant play. On a quantitative level, the mean duration of male-infant play was five times greater than that of mother-infant play in the control group (30.17 vs. 6.04 1/100 min). On a descriptive level there were also great differences. Play in the con? trol group consisted largely in the infant us? ing the mother as an object to bounce or jump off, and when mothers did respond they usually just administered one or two mild cuffs. This is in marked contrast to the highly reciprocal and intense play of adult males and infants. We were unsuccessful in finding a detailed account of rhesus mother-infant play in so? cial groups. Infants rarely play with adults in general, including their own mothers; peers are much more appealing play part- ners and such play can last for hours (e.g., Altmann, 1962; Kaufmann, 1966; Hinde and Spencer-Booth, 1967; Loizos, 1967; Lindburg, 1971). MiUar (1968, p. 89) con? cluded in her review that "play between monkey mothers and infants is relatively rare, except in so far as the mothers' con? stant grooming, inspection and physical contact can be called so." Infants in a heterogenous social group thus spend very little time playing with their mothers and even less time with adult males. However, we furnished the same op- portunities for mothers and adult males to play with infants in the absence of peers. Intense and frequent play did not develop in the mother infant dyads; it clearly did in the adult male-infant dyads. These and other trends, in conclusion, seem to point to a great flexibility or open- ness in the behavioral systems of adult male rhesus monkeys. In this sense they can per? haps be viewed as a behavioral resource for the social group (cf. Davids, 1972, for a dis- cussion of human paternal roles), being capable of a wide range of modifiability. One of the mother's very important roles, in contrast, would seem to be to provide a very stable and reliable source of attach? ment and protection for infants. The male's flexibility, at least with respect to play, might also be viewed as a tendency toward a more prolonged neoteny. We emphasize that we are not viewing males as "better" parents than females; statements about differences do not in themselves imply evaluation. Indeed, there are also disadvantages to behavioral plas- ticity, insofar as it may involve a greater vulnerability to the effects of environmen? tal events. The point which we wish to stress and upon which we conclude, however, is the surprising potential for behavioral change in fully mature rhesus monkey males given appropriate opportunities. We are again reminded of the folly and perhaps arro- gance of making sweeping statements about the limits of an animal's behavioral reper? toire. REFERENCES Altmann, S. A. 1962.
