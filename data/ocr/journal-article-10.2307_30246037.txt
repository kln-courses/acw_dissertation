Through 1957, serious archaeological research conducted within the Tucson Basin was minimal, consisting of a brief overview by Ellsworth Huntington in 1913, two four-page articles (both published in The Kiva), and two unpublished masters' theses. The first article, written by Clara Lee Fraps (Tanner) in 1935 concerned the Tanque Verde Ruin and the second, written by William H. Kelly in 1936, dealt with the University Indian Ruin. Emil W. Haury's master's thesis, written in 1928, also dealt with the Tanque Verde Ruin while Norman Gabel's master's thesis, written in 1931, discussed the late prehistoric community adjacent to Martinez Hill and the trincheras features on the hill proper. During the next dozen years, the situation improved only slightly with the publication of five articles, all in The Kiva: Rogers in 1958 dealt with surface lithics of Archaic age; Fontana, Greenleaf, and Cassidy in 1959 discussed the trincheras site of Black Mountain; Zahniser in 1965 and 1970 reported on surveys in Saguaro National Monument and the Tanque Verde phase; and Hemmings in 1969 reported on a small, buried site on the Santa Cruz River. The major publication of the decade was Julian D. Hayden's monograph, published in 1957, reporting his excavations conducted at University Indian Ruin in 1940. By the late 1970s, two additional monographs on major prehistoric sites were published. The excavations at the Punta de Agua sites were reported by Greenleaf in 1975, 10 years after the fieldwork was concluded, and the excavations at the Hodges Ruin were published by Kelly in 1978, 40 years after completion of the excavations. Within the last decade a new generation of archaeologists has begun to take more interest in the archaeological grass south of the Gila River. With the help of funding provided by contract archaeology projects and with a basic knowledge provided by Kelly, Hayden, Haury, Greenleaf and others, our understanding of local prehistory has expanded considerably. For example, projects have been undertaken concerning the Hardy Site, the prehistoric community under Fort Lowell; Tumamoc Hill; Los Morteros; and several of the major drainages that flow through the basin, especially the Santa Cruz River. The paper published here represents an excellent example of the current interest in local archaeological problems. It focuses on a hill, Rillito Peak, located at the northern end of the Tucson Mountains. In spite of the fact that this hill is located only a few miles from the University of Arizona, this location was not recorded as supporting any prehistoric activity until Wallace and his IX</page><page sequence="9">colleagues took the time to look. We learn here, however, that it was intimately associated with the large Los Morteros village on the west bank of the Santa Cruz River and abounds with grinding features, petroglyphs, and walled structures of several types. The overdue growth in attention to Tucson Basin archaeology is an encouraging sign. May the grass continue to grow green south of the Gila! In addition to exemplifying this new interest in Tucson Basin archaeology, this paper represents an editorial "first." In an effort to save AAHS both time and money, it was typed into the word processor at the Arizona State Museum and was transmitted by telephone to our publisher, Publication Services, in Tempe. Barbara Fitzpatrick and Rosemary Maddock, who typed the manuscript into the computer, and Carol Heathington, computer systems specialist at the Museum, provided the necessary expertise in the mysteries of computer inter- action, helping editors who have not yet made the technological leap from red pencils, yellow manuscript pages, and mechanical typewriters. This issue is very much a trial run; the editorial staff does not yet know if any savings will be effected. However, if the computerized system proves to be efficient, its use will definitely be continued.

I would like to thank Alan Ferg, then the Highway Salvage Archaeologist, for providing the opportunity to do this research and for his prompt assistance and support whenever it was required throughout Phase I. I especially want to express my gratitude to those who gave so much of their time and effort as volunteers for this project: James Holmlund, Norma Holmlund, John Murray, Anne Hoy, and Cindy Wallace. A particular debt of gratitude is owed to James Holmlund for many days of mountain hiking and endless frustrating hours spent examining and recording the cupules and petroglyphs. Without his persistence and determination they never could have been recorded. Bruce Huckell of the Arizona State Museum, kindly proffered his expertise in lithic quarrying and utilization in several discussions with the author and personally examined the jasper quarry discussed in Chapter 3. Discussions of various topics with Richard Lange of the Arizona State Museum, and Julio Betancourt of the U.S. Geological Survey, were helpful in developing several of the ideas presented in this report. Richard Case, then President of the Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society, kindly offered his services as guide to the sites of AZ AA: 15:1 and AZ BB:5:35, two major petroglyph localities. Gayle Hartmann directed the author to AZ AA: 12:136, a previously unrecorded petroglyph and pictograph site. Sharon Urban of the Arizona State Museum, was a constant source of informa- tion on petroglyphs and petroglyph sites in the Tucson area. I would like to thank Paul Fish for his constant encouragement and financial assistance through the Arizona State Museum and the Los Morteros Testing Project. Dr. Fish's provocative ideas regarding the Rattlesnake Pass trincheras were instrumental in developing the author's research on Rillito Peak. The use of the University of Arizona computer for producing the statistics and figures presented in Chapter 2 was made possible by Keith Kintigh of the Arizona State Museum. Karen Lominac also assisted in developing the computer programs used. The members of my Internship committee, Paul Fish, R. Gwinn Vivian, and Lynn S. Teague (all of the Arizona State Museum) provided many useful comments and constructive criticism. I would also like to thank Alan Ferg of the Arizona State Museum, and Michael Schiffer of the Department of Anthro- pology at the University of Arizona, for reading and commenting on early drafts of the report. Gayle Hartmann edited the final version of the report in her usual exemplary fashion. Her comments and suggestions were invaluable in XI</page><page sequence="11">producing a version suitable for publication. Any errors remaining in logic or grammar are fully the author's responsibility. James Holmlufnd drafted the line drawings and Cindy Wallace drew most of the other illustrations. Barbara Fitzpatrick typed the final draft.

She edited and typed the preliminary draft of the report. xii</page><page sequence="12">THE KIVA, Vol. 48, No. 3, Spring 1983 ABSTRACT An intensive survey of Rillito Peak, a mountain forming the northwest boundary of the extensive Los Morteros Site (AZ AA: 12:57 ASM) at the northwest periphery of the Tucson Basin, revealed an extensive array of bedrock mortars, metates, cupules, trincheras, rock shelters, petroglyphs, and a lithic quarry. Detailed analyses of the spatial distribution, morphological attributes, and associations with the cultural and natural environment were conducted for these features. Most are found to relate to the Tanque Verde phase Hohokam occupation of the site. The 305 mortars documented at the site probably relate to the processing of mesquite beans. They indicate the significance of this nondomestic resource in the local and perhaps regional economy. Cupule distribution is found to be. associated with the mortars and several hypotheses concerning their function are presented. Most likely of these is that they are a byproduct from the manufacture of stone pestles. The 97 documented trincheras on Rillito Peak are classified into various shape and wall classes. Most are interpreted to represent short-term or seasonal habitation while some may have been used for the cultivation of specialized crops. The petroglyphs at Los Morteros and 26 additional Tucson area sites are examined for design element patterning and environmental associations. A correlation between the sites and the processing or procurement of nondomestic resources critical to the Hohokam is docu- mented. An alternative method for analysis is presented for future studies. xiii</page><page sequence="13">THE KIVA, Vol. 48, No. 3, Spring 1983 Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION As a result of heavy flooding by the Santa Cruz River during January 1979, an emergency access road was constructed by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) from Material Pit 6117 to Avra Valley Road. Portions of Rillito Peak within the Los Morteros Site (AZ AA:12:57 ASM) were impacted.* A report by Laurens C. Hammack (1979) documented damage to prehistoric petroglyphs, mortars, and a small habitation area and he recom- mended that the remaining petroglyphs and mortars along the access road be recorded. Through the initial funding provided by ADOT in response to Hammack's recommendations, a survey design was developed to provide the basis for an evaluation of the cultural resources of Rillito Peak. The first phase of the survey, conducted in April and May 1980, provided ADOT with detailed information on the petroglyphs, mortars and habitation remains present along the materials pit access road (Wallace 1980). The second phase, conducted during September and October 1980, attempted to relate the floodplain-terrace occupation of Los Morteros to the exploitation of the mountainous environment of Rillito Peak. The author was particularly interested in the interrelationships of several specific features of the Hohokam cultural landscape - bedrock mortars, cupules, petroglyphs and trincheras - in the hope that some of the poorly understood aspects of these cultural remains might be clarified. SETTING The Los Morteros Site (AZ AA: 12:57) is located just east of the northern- most portion of the Tucson Mountains with the mountain ridge forming the western boundary and the Santa Cruz River the eastern boundary. Major portions of the site are distributed along the floodplain and first alluvial terrace *Note that all site numbers appearing in the text are Arizona State Museum assigned numbers and will not be followed by the institutional reference. 137</page><page sequence="14">138 WALLACE for a distance of nearly two and one-half kilometers from Point of Mountain to Rattlesnake Pass (Figures 1 and 2). A large number of mounds, possible canals, and a ballcourt are present in this area. Preliminary inspection of ceramics from the site indicates a Colonial to early Classic period occupation. Test excavations by the Arizona State Museum (Lange 1980) and archaeological field classes conducted through the Department of Anthropology and the Continuing Educa- tion Program at the University of Arizona have uncovered over 50 archaeo- logical features at the site. Specific reports on the results of excavations are currently in preparation. The mountainous portion of Los Morteros is divided by a low pass known historically as Puerto del Azotado (Bolton 1931), which effectively separates Rillito Peak from the remaining portions of the Tucson Mountains north of Rattlesnake Pass. This study focuses on Rillito Peak (defined here as the entire mountain north of Puerto del Azotado) and two small bedrock outcrops in the floodplain, the PG-MK and MS-7 clusters (Figures 2 and 6). The Santa Cruz River flows northward along the eastern boundary of the Los Morteros Site to Point of Mountain, flanking Rillito Peak for a short distance before angling off to the west. It is currently a point of conjecture whether the river was a perennially flowing stream at Point of Mountain in historic and prehistoric times. It is known, however, that due to a constriction in the northern end of the Cortaro Basin, the water table is much nearer to the surface than in other areas to the north and south. A major mesquite bosque covered much of the river floodplain in the early 1960s (Bohrer 197 1:Figure 2). Vegetation in the unaltered portions of the site is typical of the Lower Sonoran Desert environmental zone (Lowe 1964). Dominant plants include saguaro, palo verde, mesquite, and bursage. Rillito Peak is formed entirely from mid-Tertiary andesitic intrusions (as are the two isolated fingers of bedrock examined in this paper), but varies considerably between the eastern and western slopes. In general, the east and northeast slopes are much rockier, with numerous andesitic outcrops displaying varied degrees of patination. The most prominent of these outcrops (the PA-MI clusters) extends in several segments from the midsummit of Rillito Peak to Point of Mountain where the Santa Cruz first touches the mountain (see Figure 6). Although the name "Point of Mountain" has historically meant the entire region around Rillito Peak, here it is used as a specific reference to this prominent outcrop that forms the most significant landmark on the eastern slope and permits easy access to the summit. Most of the western slope is rimmed by a major escarpment with a low central saddle providing the only easy crossing; much of the rock strewn on the western slope is a result of the spalling of large boulders from this scarp. Portions of the summit of Rillito Peak south of the central saddle are surprisingly level. These areas have been the foci for much of the prehistoric interest in the mountain (see Chapter 3). Vegetation is densest on</page><page sequence="15">Rillito Peak 139 Tortolita A A12:813 A:12:1V0 8 9 A 97 AA 12 80 A MAMtnSI AA :912 :579 AA:L12:A :AA I2A A 2 4 AA 12 T sonanaHodge RRnt SAAA:16418 AA 12 134 4 5mordy AA:12 728:9:14 LA: 1 26 56 688:13:121 3 &amp;- M 13!135 V s r d e Mt nns Mortinez Hill RuiB 4 Iac2k AA:2 88331 41 Mtna Mtn s.

Only one spring has been located, a small seep near the saddle, though several areas may once have had at least occasional seeps as seen from numerous calcareous deposits. The only major sources of water are three large cavities in a single bedrock outcrop on the upper eastern slope. These tinajas have been observed to contain relatively clear water for most of the year. Two of them show evidence of prehistoric use in the form of smoothed margins. Another much smaller tinaja is located atop the south-central summit. To understand the context of Rillito Peak in relation to the Hohokam cultural environment it is important to recognize that it is situated in a zone of intensive prehistoric occupation. Although survey is not yet completed for the region surrounding the site, it is known that a major settlement (AZ AA: 12:73),</page><page sequence="17">Rillito Peak 141 apparently occupied from the Colonial to Classic periods, exists to the west of Rillito Peak. Other large sites, contemporary and earlier, are located across the Santa Cruz River to the east from Los Morteros. Immediately adjacent to Rillito Peak along the east slope are two separate areas with high densities of surface artifacts (see Figure 6). From the diversity in types of artifacts present (including ceramics, shell, and ground stone) and the numbers of mano and metate fragments observed, it seems likely that these areas were zones of habitation. A surface collection yielded primarily Tanque Verde Red-on-brown for the decorated ceramics with one Rillito Red-on-brown sherd. There were no Tucson phase types found, thus making the Tanque Verde phase (A.D. 1225-1300) the most likely assignment for the main occupation. Similar ceramic data have been recorded in the sample from the slopes of Rillito Peak. The 14 identifiable decorated sherds from the slopes and summit of Rillito Peak were all Tanque Verde Red-on-brown suggesting that a Classic period date (A.D. 1225-1450) can be assigned to the archaeological remains encountered. As the majority of settlement on the floodplain and terrace below seems to date prior to the Tucson phase, and late ceramics are absent, a Tanque Verde phase assignment seems most reasonable. A variety of cultural impacts to the Los Morteros Site, both historic and recent, must be considered in evaluating the data presented in this report. Most serious of these are ADOT Materials Pit 6117 and the construction of the new access road along the eastern edge of Rillito Peak. The materials pit removed probable habitation zones and damaged a boulder containing numerous cupules and mortars (MS-7). The construction of the access road, which resulted in the initiation of this research, destroyed and damaged an unknown number of mortars, petroglyphs, and probable habitation zones at the base of the east and northeast slopes of Rillito Peak. It is probable that the southernmost of the two large artifact scatters and clusters MB, MF, PE, and PA have been most seriously damaged. Vandalism in the form of breakage and removal of petroglyph boulders has probably been occurring for many years. The construc- tion of a canal and pipeline, probably in the Cortaro Farms era in the 1920s impacted portions of the MB cluster. A more detailed description of the impacts to Rillito Peak is provided in Wallace (1980). METHODS The survey of Rillito Peak was accomplished in two phases with each phase preceded by preliminary field reconnaissance. One of the major difficulties encountered in designing the survey was the lack of any measure by which resource distribution could be predicted. Although a great quantity of informa- tion is available on Hohokam site distribution and the characteristics of different kinds of sites that occur in relatively level environments, very little investigation</page><page sequence="18">142 WALLACE of the mountain slopes has been accomplished. The recent series of articles published on Tumamoc Hill (Wilcox and others 1979) is a notable exception. Phase I of this survey covered the lower third of the eastern slope and most of the western slope. Phase 2 covered the remaining portions of Rillito Peak with the exception of the area on the northwest slope shown in Figure 23. This area was nonsystematically examined for cultural remains and found to contain several possible trincheras-like features and a possible basalt quarry. The area was not included in this report as it is apparently more closely tied to the large Hohokam site nearby (AZ AA: 12:73) than to Los Morteros, the focus of this research. Thus, excluding this area, approximately 80 percent of Rillito Peak was surveyed. Crew spacing was approximately five meters on all but the western slopes. Due to the very different nature of the western side of the mountain (not as rocky, less vegetation), crew spacing was expanded to approximately seven meters. On*all sldpes an effort was made to carefully examine all rock surfaces that might have petroglyphs or mortars. Each cultural feature or boulder with mortars or petroglyphs was plotted on a transparent overlay on an ADOT aerial photograph. This photograph (No. 795 M-3) has a scale of I inch = 300 feet and was taken on 12 April 1979. The field map produced was used to draw Figures 6 and 23. Contour lines were taken from the USGS Marana 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle with a scale of 1:24,000. Approximately 20 person-days were involved in the actual survey of the mountain and approximately 27 person-days were spent recording and photo- graphing petroglyphs, mortars, and other cultural features. Collections of artifacts were limited to diagnostic ceramics and other items that were particularly significant to the research interests defined in the following chapters. Petroglyphs, mortars, and cupules were recorded by using separate numbering systems with identical formats. As both mortars and petroglyphs are generally distributed on groups of boulders, a letter designation was assigned to each separate cluster of mortar or petroglyph boulders (Ferg 1979: 96). All mortar numbers are preceded by the letter "M" and all petroglyph numbers are preceded by the letter "P." Thus, when a boulder contained both mortars and petroglyphs it was assigned two different cluster-boulder numbers, one for the mortars and one for the glyphs. For the purpose of providing comparative data, petroglyphs and mortars were also recorded on the bedrock outcrops in the floodplain, and mortars were recorded in two localities north of Rattlesnake Pass. Trincheras were also recorded in clusters. However, in order that the numbering system be comparable to that being applied to the Rattlesnake Pass trincheras by the Arizona State Museum (Downum, Fish and Fish 1981), they have been numbered consecutively.</page><page sequence="19">THE KIVA, Vol. 48, No. 3, Spring 1983 Chapter 2 MORTARS AND CUPULES PREVIOUS STUDIES Very little archaeological research concerning bedrock mortars has been attempted in Arizona. The only detailed study presently available in the Hohokam area is that of Larson (1979). He plotted mortar distribution in relation to "rock circles" and activity areas on the Tumamoc Hill summit. Several types of mortars are discussed and, based on frequencies and sizes, inferences are made concerning their utilization (Larson 1979:76-77). In California, early studies such as Barrett and Gifford (1933), provide important ethnographic data on the Miwok use of bedrock mortars. Bennyhoff (1956), working in Yosemite National Park, used Barrett and Gifford's material in developing a system for determining both the length and size of occupation at a settlement, based respectively, on the depths and numbers of bedrock mortars. Johnson (1967:22), on the other hand, reports for the Commanche Reservoir locality that "the distribution of mortar pits seems to be primarily affected by the location of the bedrock areas and by the probable population distribution during different parts of the year." Dills (1975) suggests that mortar size variability could be used to delineate cultural groups. In analyzing his data, he finds that differences in mortar size and shape between sites is probably significant, although he admits that his data are insufficient. Dills does not attempt to explain these results. On the basis of these studies, the authors believe that the spatial distribution of mortars, their physical attributes, and relationships with cultural features and the natural environment may be significant. CLASSIFICATION Initial reconnaissance indicated that the mortars at Los Morteros could not readily be categorized into the typology developed by Johnson (1942: 323) for mortars in California. Only two relatively distinct morphological types appeared useful for classification. The bedrock mortars (Type I in Wallace 1980) with 143</page><page sequence="20">144 WALLACE cross sections as shown in Figure 3 are referred to throughout this report as "mortars." They have a characteristically smooth, rounded or somewhat conical bottom that shows evidence of the use of a large pestle. These mortars are usually well ground and generally range from 3.0 to 30.0 cm in depth and from 9.0 to 24.0 cm in diameter. Three hundred and five such mortars were recorded at Los Morteros. The second type (Type 2 in Wallace 1980) was defined in the field on the basis of a pecked-out appearance, a generally round but irregular shape and somewhat uneven interior surfaces (Figure 4). This classification is supported by their spatial distribution and an anomalous depth-diameter frequency distri- bution. Many of them appear to have been produced by a pointed tool. This type appears to fall within what Hedges (1973:21) has termed "cupules" in southern California and, as such, they could also be classified within the Pit-and-Groove petroglyph style as defined by Baumhoff, Heizer, and Elsasser (1958) in the Great Basin. As recommended at the 1980 American Rock Art Research Association conference in Albuquerque, they will be referred to in this report as "cupules," although it should be noted that the term has been used to define a wider range of features than are present at Los Morteros, and that what the authors term "small mortars" may indeed be within the definition of a cupule. The cupules at Los Morteros are much smaller in average size than mortars, ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 cm in depth and from 1.0 to 7.0 cm in diameter. Six hundred and seventeen were recorded at Los Morteros. METHODS Dills' Method of Measurement In a paper discussing the techniques for measuring a mortar, Dills (1975) outlines a procedure he feels should be standardly adopted. Dills' methods are discussed here in some detail because no previous standardized procedure for Arizona has been suggested, and Dills has put forth his method as the minimum Large mortars Midrange mortar Small mortar Figure 3. Cross sections and sizes of typical mortars.</page><page sequence="21">Rillito Peak 145 Figure 4. Cross sections and sizes of typical cupules. standard procedure. Our evaluation of the efficiency and interpretive potential of his method in light of the Los Morteros study, therefore, seems important. Basically, Dills proposes that the constant of proportionality between volume and the depth squared of a mortar (parabolic coefficient) is the most statistically accurate and meaningful variable for delineating possible differences in mortar sizes between sites and culture groups. Furthermore, he points out that although shape differences do occur (in California mortars), nearly every mortar exhibits a high degree of parabolicity. Conventional depth and diameter measurements are relatively crude according to Dills, and he believes his system of measuring the volume as a function of depth is much more accurate. However, there are several problems with his method that make his techniques inadequate as a standard archaeological field procedure. These problems are discussed below. 1. Because mortars occur in a variety of rock types subject to different degrees of weathering, fracture, and porosity, the use of spill height to determine an accurate depth measurement as Dills suggests, would frequently yield highly inaccurate results. Many of the mortars at Los Morteros have small fractures, vesicles, or were made in crevices or small cavities that would make Dills' estimation of a parabolic shape impossible. These mortars are, however, perfectly amenable to standard measurements of depth and diameter. 2. Dills' system cannot accurately measure mortars with volumes less than 500 ml (8 to 9 cm in depth) or that cannot be filled at least halfway. This would preclude the measurement of more than 70 percent of the mortars at Los Morteros, 85 percent of the mortars on Tumamoc Hill (Larson 1979:80), and large percentages at most bedrock mortar sites described in the literature for southern California. 3. A fairly substantial quantity of measuring paraphernalia would be required to carry out Dills' measurements relative to that used to measure depth and diameter. In short, Dills' procedure for measuring mortars is inefficient, requiring more time and effort to gather and reduce data than can reasonably be justified by his error considerations. Furthermore, the results of this study suggest that</page><page sequence="22">146 WALLACE the independent variables of depth and diameter can realize a greater potential for delineating differences between groups of mortars than the volume versus depth measurement. We do believe, however, that shape measurement by an instrument such as Dills' "mortar mette" could provide valuable comparative data, especially concerning the relationship of the hardness of pestles to the hardness of the mortar rock. This would further substantiate inferences on grinding motion that depth-diameter measurements can provide. Procedures at Los Morteros The recording procedure for mortars and cupules at Los Morteros was developed to provide an accurate measure of numbers and sizes, spatial distri- bution, and relationships to other cultural and non-cultural features. It was considered that depth and diameter would efficiently characterize any variability that might occur in the size of mortars. In addition to the cluster-boulder designations described in Chapter 1, mortars were individually numbered. When more than one mortar occurred on a particular boulder, field sketches were drawn. For each mortar, associations with "aprons" (to be discussed below), ground depressions, metates, and petroglyphs were noted if they occurred on the same boulder. Whether mortars were broken or were placed in a natural depression was also noted. Mortars Mortars were measured in centimeters with the diameter taken in two perpendicular directions across the orifice. These two measurements were averaged and rounded to the nearest whole centimeter. If the orifice of the mortar was elliptical in shape, both measurements were noted. Diameter is the most difficult measurement to read accurately as the limits of many mortars are somewhat subjective. In this analysis, limits of the diameter were defined by the uppermost edge of the well-ground portion of the mortar. In cases where this was difficult to determine (due chiefly to weathering), the inflection points (the points at which a pestle would no longer have touched the side of a mortar) were used to define the diameter (Figure 5). After removing any fill from the mortar, a thin, straight piece of wire or wood was placed across the diameter and a measurement was taken from the bottom of the mortar up to the stick or wire. In cases where one width of the orifice was lower than the other, a more complex procedure was used to obtain a true depth/diameter ratio, as well as to represent the depth of the mortar. One diameter measurement was taken from the highest defined point on the rim of the mortar to the lowest point' The perpendicular diameter measurement to this was then taken, and the two</page><page sequence="23">Rillito Peak 147 I I I SLOPE I I DIAMETER. I I INFLECTION A 'POINT INFLECTION POINT MIDPOINT HEIGHT Figure 5. Technique of mortar measurement. averaged. As shown in Figure 5, the sloping diameter measurement represents the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose horizontal side characterizes the diameter of the mortar at the lowest rim height. Though this lower diameter would yield a true depth to width ratio if the depth were measured to the horizontal diameter, it would underrepresent the functional height of the mortar. Therefore, the depth of the mortar should be taken at the mid-point of the sloping "hypotenuse" diameter. This mid-point height would accurately represent both the depth/diameter ratio and the functional depth of the mortar (Figure 5). For example, the error associated with using the slope diameter for a mortar having a 24 cm diameter and vertical walls would be approximately + 0.5 cm at 17 degrees (or a difference in rim heights of about 7 cm). In the same mortar, if the slope were 23 degrees (a difference of about 10 cm), the error would be + 1.0 cm. The error in a typical diameter measurement itself was assumed to be about 1.0 cm for mortars over 12 cm in diameter (-+ 0.5 cm for those less than 12 cm). Thus, the worst possible error at 17 degrees would be + 1.5 cm, and for 23 degrees, + 2.0 cm. Because the depth measurement needs no geometric correction, the only error associated with it is measurement error (less than 1.0 cm). Therefore, at the 17 degree angle, there would be a maximum error of about six percent (1.5 cm in 24 cm). Because, in the field, angles were invariably less than 15 degrees and averaged less than ten (and mortar walls were never vertical, allowing for a much lower correction term), this correction error term was ignored. If a mortar was broken to the point that only a single diameter measurement could be obtained, the depth to this diameter was measured and this measurement was assumed to be accurate. These cases were mentioned in the field notes.</page><page sequence="24">148 WALLACE Cupules Cupules were measured in the same manner as the mortars except that, because of their small size, the depth measurements were always perpendicular to the diameter measurements, and therefore, the slope diameter is irrelevant. Thus, errors associated with cupule measurement were, simply, measurement error. This was assumed to be about 0.5 cm for both depth and diameter, though actual error was probably no more than a few millimeters in most cases. Dating Direct dating of a mortar's or cupule's beginning, use-life, or last use in absolute terms is impossible at present and indirect methods must be used. It was noted in Chapter 1 that the inferred habitation at the base of Rillito Peak appeared to date mainly to the Tanque Verde phase (A.D. 1225-1350). This leads to the tenuous inference that the mortars and cupules located nearby were last used, if not begun, during the Tanque Verde phase. The MS-7 boulder to the south appears to be located in a zone of Rincon to Tanque Verde phase use, and the MK cluster, in the center of the Los Morteros Site, is located in what is known to be an intensive Colonial through Classic period occupation. According to Hayden (1969), mesquite was being utilized during the Sacaton phase, and it is not difficult to believe that the Rincon phase and earlier inhabitants of Los Morteros made use of the mesquite bosque that was very likely at the base of Rillito Peak. Thus, the possibility that the inhabitants of Los Morteros made and used mortars throughout the Los Morteros sequence cannot be ignored. The fact that the area immediately adjacent to Rillito Peak seems to have been used mainly during the Tanque Verde phase does, however, suggest that the mortars were developed and used to the greatest extent at that time. A similar argument can be made for the cupules, as their distribution is closely related to that of the mortars. MORTARS Function On the basis of their association with the mesquite bosque believed to have existed at the base of Rillito Peak and the extensive ethnohistoric and ethno- graphic literature on their utilization (see Bell and Castetter 1937; Doelle 1976 for summaries), it is assumed that the mortars at Los Morteros were primarily used in the processing of mesquite (Prosopis velutina) for human consumption. Other wild plants known to have been processed in mortars by the Pima and Papago include the heads of the saltbush (Atriplex sp.) (Russell 1908:73);</page><page sequence="25">Rillito Peak 149 cotton seeds (Gossypium sp.) (Russell 1908:77); the seeds of the palo verde (Cercidiumn microphyllum) (Russell 1908:75; Castetter and Bell 1942:60); and, according to Juanita Ahill, a resident of the Papago Reservation, acorns (Quercus sp.). It is likely that at least some of the mortars were used for plants such as those listed here, however their primary function is assumed to have been oriented to the grinding of mesquite. Small quantities of medicinal or seasoning plants would most likely have been ground in the small portable mortars that are frequently found in Hohokam habitation areas. The gathering and processing of mesquite has been described in detail in the literature noted above. Only a brief summary of some of the relevant points is presented below. Among the Pima and Papago, mesquite was gathered annually in late summer after the saguaro fruit harvest. The harvest of mesquite for the Pima was a tribal event, large parties constituting the expeditions, with the women the principal gatherers. The pods were collected in cylindrical granary baskets and these stored on the roofs of the houses or sheds or on platforms, where they would be safe from rodents (Bell and Castetter 1937:22). For the Papago, Hayden (1969:156) reports that mesquite was ground at "communal bedrock mortars near the scene of gathering, and the roughly crushed material was taken to the villages for grinding to 'pechita' or flour on individually owned metates." The differences between these two systems, one involving processing at the resource procurement location and the other involving gathering and storage for later processing, may be attributed to the presence of bedrock outcrops throughout Papagueria that are suitable for bedrock mortars, whereas in the Pima area, the mesquite bosques are situated away from any bedrock outcrops. The actual processing of the mesquite may be accomplished in a variety of ways. The pods can be pulverized in a mortar using a stone or wooden pestle, and the seeds and seed husks discarded, or the seeds may be ground after sifting, using a metate or stone mortar and pestle (the seeds being too hard to crush with wooden implements) (Hayden 1969:156). The process can be separated, then, into two stages: the first for reducing the pods to flour, and the second for grinding the seeds. The second stage of the process involving the reduction of seeds to flour entails a considerably higher expenditure of energy than does the reduction of the pod. Doelle ( 1976:60-6 1) has pointed out that the high expenditure of energy necessary to reduce the seeds may mean that they served as food sources only in times of famine, though Bell and Castetter (1937:22) state that the seeds may have been used more regularly by the Pima. The processing of mesquite pods requires the use of a mortar and pestle as they are too sticky for grinding in the metate (Bell and Castetter 1937:22). The seeds, on the other hand, were generally ground during processing rather than being pounded in a mortar. Due to their small size and excessive hardness, this</page><page sequence="26">150 WALLACE would have been most efficiently accomplished in a basin or trough metate (Eddy 1964:8), though none of the historic accounts are explicit enough to asceitain the type of metate used. Although wooden mortars and pestles are reported ethnographically, bedrock or portable stone mortars and pestles seemed to have been preferred (Bell and Castetter 1937). Flour produced from the mesquite pod is quite palatable and nutritious, containing a significant percentage of protein (Doelle 1976:60). Several foods were prepared from mesquite flour, including beverages and several types of cakes or breads. Doelle (1976) has demonstrated that in the processing of mesquite pods, energy is efficiently expended in terms of nutritional gain for the calories burned, and it is known historically that it "was one of the most important, if not the most important, article of diet for the Pima of primitive times" (Bell and Castetter 1937:21-22). Mesquite, in both seed and pod form, has frequently been reported in archaeological context from sites in southern Arizona. It has been found at Snaketown (Bohrer 1970), Ventana Cave (Haury 1950), Las Colinas (Hall 1973), Punta de Agua (Boher, Cutler, and Sauer 1969), and possibly San Cayetano (Cutler 1956). According to Richard Lange of the Arizona State Museum it has been identified in the form of seeds and timbers at Los Morteros in a Tanque Verde phase primary cremation. Spatial Distribution and Size Mortars on Rillito Peak are localized in two general areas - near the summit, and around the north and east base of the mountain (Figure 6). Most are concentrated along the base of the eastern slope. In addition, a single isolated boulder (MS-7) is located southeast of Rillito Peak in the former floodplain of the Santa Cruz River (now ADOT Materials Pit 6117). Only two other mortar clusters are located at Los Morteros: MK and ML (Figure 2). The MK cluster, like MS-7, is an isolated outcrop of the local andesite occurring in the center of an apparently intensive habitation area. The ML cluster is situated on the mountain slope among the lower Rattlesnake Pass trincheras. A scattergram plot of depth versus diameter for all mortars at Los Morteros (Figure 7) closely resembles that obtained by Larson (1979:80) for the mortars on the Tumamoc Hill summit, although mortars at Los Morteros attained twice the depth (33 cm) of those at Tumamoc. Based on the scattergram (Figure 7) and histogram (Figure 8), three size groups of mortars can be described - small, midrange, and large. Because of their significant distributions at Los Morteros, these groups will be referred to throughout this report. Small mortars are those less than 2.5 cm deep. This group is represented by a nearly horizontal straight line on the scattergram and high frequency on the</page><page sequence="27">A. - O0 \ NOT UR EYED O.00 MS-1 BM 2130 Q/ MA 0 o Boulder with mortar(s) 0S * Boulder with cupule(s) o u, 4 MS Boulder with mort20r(s) and Cupule(s) M 9 Concentration of artifacts L contour nerv l 0 of M, 00 ID \3O M xI 0 L-b MS-1 0 MS-15 0 M v7 0 Mo MC Mo M H 0 Boulder with mortarW MI 0 Bulder with cupule(s) MS - 4 0 Boulder with mortar(s) and cupule~) s)i` co Cncentration of artifactsIl 0 20 40 so so 100 2100. contour intervol: 50ft Figure 6.

A similar grouping in numbers and size is reported by Larson (1979:80) for the Tumamoc Hill mortars. Both the authors and Larson (1979: 76-81) believe that these small mortars were not used to grind wild plant resources. Their spatial distribution at Los Morteros is closely tied to that of the cupules to the extent that they are occasionally found on the sloping or vertical sides of boulders (see Cupules discussion below). This suggests that although the shapes of cupules and small mortars are different, their functions are related. The deviation from the nearly horizontal linear growth of the small mortars appears to begin at about 3 cm in depth and 9 cm in diameter, marking the beginning of what the authors consider to be functional mortars. This group of midrange mortars appears to follow a relationship of nearly one-to-one growth between depth and diameter up to a maximum depth of about 15 cm. The group of large mortars (deeper than 15 cm) appears to represent a final stage in mortar growth during which diameter increase is minimal compared to the increase in depth. The maximum mortar depth recorded at Los Morteros is 33 cm.

In general, the mesquite bosque inferred to have existed along the southeast portion of Rillito Peak, the Santa Cruz River, suitable rock, zones of habitation, petroglyphs, cupules, and trincheras all appear to be associated in some way with the mortars. The single most important locational variable on an intrasite and regional basis appears to be the mesquite bosque. The tendency for the mortars to concentrate in specific discrete areas at the base of Rillito Peak is probably related to zones of habitation and the location of boulders or bedrock suitable for making and using mortars. Intensive-use Boulders Notable among the localized concentrations of mortars are six boulders which, by virtue of the numbers and sizes of mortars on them, were used much more extensively than the others (Table 1). Taken together, they contain 43 percent of the mortars found at Los Morteros and have more than 86 percent of the mortars over 15 cm deep. These boulders also contain 59 percent of the bedrock metates and 86 percent of the cupules if MF-8, a boulder resting atop MF-7, is included. A comparison of the depth versus diameter scattergram plots for the intensive-use boulders, MK- I and MK-2 (Figures 9 and 10), and the plot for all Los Morteros mortars combined (Figure 7) reveals that these boulders have very few or no midrange mortars. Most of the intensive-use boulders contain mortars with a bimodal size distribution, particularly with respect to diameters. It is important to note that the two exceptions to this pattern, MS-2 and MF-7, both lack small mortars. For MF-7, the missing small mortars are found nearby on MF-8 (Figu-e 11) and this pair of boulders may be treated as a single intensive-use location. It is possible that MS-7 also contains the missing small mortars that would be expected on MS-2. It seems likely that each large cluster of mortars once had at least one intensive-use boulder nearby. Unfortunately, due to blasting and access road improvements, several boulders (ME-6, MF- 14, MS-4, MS-5) were moved out of context or damaged, and large areas of bedrock that may once have had mortars were completely destroyed. If it is assumed that these aras did have intensive-use boulders, as suggested above, then each large cluster of mortars would have had small, midrange, and large mortars represented. In contrast, 43 percent of the mortars are distributed on 90 boulders located along the slopes of Rillito Peak and the floodplain. This set of mortars consists mainly of midrange and small mortars. The midrange mortars here, and in the</page><page sequence="31">Table 1. Mortars, metates, and cupules on intensive-use boulders.

The location of most of the small and large mortars within any large cluster on the intensive-use boulders suggests that a particular rock's size and topography was preferred for the processing task. The number of midrange mortars that were found on scattered boulders near intensive-use boulders could indicate an increase in the number of people processing mesquite through gradual population growth or influx, some form of ownership, or possibly both. From the evidence at Los Morteros, it seems that these midrange mortars are the result of an overflow of people caused by the occasional maximal use of the mortars on the intensive-use boulders as well as a gradual growth in the numbers of processors. The overflow may have resulted from times of particularly heavy use of the areas (perhaps during the harvest) or limited ownership of these mortars. Intensive-use boulders, then, were probably the preferred site of intermittent processing use throughout the year by the local inhabitants as well as the focus of intensive processing during or immediately following harvest times.</page><page sequence="33">Rillito Peak 157 Depth 35 + 30 + 25 + **32 20 + 2* 15 + 10 + 5+ I 5 * *5*3* 0+ 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Diameter CORRELATION (R)= .96775 R SQUARED= .93653 PLOTTED VALUES = 46 Figure 10. Scattergram of depth versus diameter for mortars on Boulder MK-2. Trincheras and Rock Shelters Eleven percent of the mortars recorded at Los Morteros are located along the upper slopes and summit of Rillito Peak. It is apparent from Figures 6 and 23 that these mortars are closely associated with the trincheras and rockshelters located in this area (see Chapter 3). Suitable rock does not seem to be an important locational variable here, and large expanses of bedrock, which undoubtedly would have been used on the floodplain or lower slopes, have not been used in favor of boulders that were closer to the trincheras and rock shelters. The mortars here characteristically occur individually rather than being placed in groups on particular boulders. As seen in Figures 12 and 13, the sizes vary little and cluster in the lower midrange size when compared with the other mortars. Their size and spatial distribution contrasts sharply with the mortars occurring elsewhere at the site. The intensive use of any particular wild resource seems to be ruled out, and the small range in depths suggests a generally concurrent use through a limited span of time. The virtual lack of mortars among the Rattlesnake Pass trincheras seems best explained in terms of the lack of an easily accessible resource such as the mesquite bosque below the trincheras on Rillito Peak.</page><page sequence="34">158 WALLACE I 00 MF-8 MF- 15 00 . ., *0 0 Mortar (with "apron") * Cupule Metate Figure 11.

Although mortar size is obviously related to the amount of use, the shape of the pestle may change with the increasing depth of the mortar. The possibility of more than one pestle being used in a single mortar must also be taken into consideration. Experimental data would provide a much better understanding of the relationships between pestle and mortar and their respective shapes and sizes. The pestles recovered during the Rillito Peak survey and the Los Morteros testing project were examined for any data they might provide on these relationships. The collection, however, should not be taken as necessarily representative of the pestles used at the site. Table 2 summarizes the physical characteristics of the pestles, and they are illustrated in Figures 14, 15, and 16. Pestle Hardness The relative hardness of pestle and mortar is believed by the authors to play a major role in determining the shape of a mortar. One would assume that pestles that were appreciably softer than the mortar rock were not used due to the difficulty in creating or developing a mortar, the damage that would occur to the pestle, and the large amount of rock debris that would be deposited in the processed food. No soft pestles were found at Los Morteros. Pestles that have close to the same relative hardness as the mortar rock (10 of the 13 collected) would probably be the most efficient, as complementary mortar-pestle shapes would be produced during the creation and use of a mortar. Mortars in these cases would probably be of the parabolic shape described by Dills (1975), with fairly rounded bottoms. For pestles appreciably harder than the local bedrock in which the mortars are made (3 of the 13 collected), it is believed that the mortar's shape would to a large degree be dependent on the initial shape of the pestle. This contention is supported by the cobble pestle in Figure 15d; it shows that despite considerable use, little alteration in its shape had occurred. It was found beside two mortars on MS-14, each end of the pestle fitting one of the two mortars. Why this situation occurred is not clear, but two mortars of different shapes resulted from the dissimilarly shaped ends of the pestle. The physical attributes of the three latite-dacite pestles collected indicate that wearing down the eccentricities in shape is not easily accomplished on a pestle that is harder than the mortar rock. This means that there will be a poor pestle-to-mortar fit, a less efficient pounding or grinding surface, and, as a result, a mortar that may be slightly irregular in horizontal cross section. Thus, areas with easily obtainable hard river cobbles that could be used as pestles</page><page sequence="37">Table 2. Physical attributes of pestles from Los Morteros.

Ellipticity was the most commonly noted irregular shape for the mortars found at Los Morteros. The distribution correlates very well with the available source of hard cobbles, though the Los Morteros pestle sample may indicate that hard pestles were not generally preferred. It is interesting to note the unusual conical shapes for some of the mortars in the MF cluster and on MF-7 in particular, below which a source of hard river cobbles is located. Assuming, as MS- 14 indicated, that the harder cobbles would be more likely to produce more conically-shaped mortars, then it is likely that some pestles used in the MF mortars were obtained from the source of river cobbles located conveniently nearby. Another hypothesis that could account for the elliptical mortars is that the technique or motion of pounding or grinding would determine mortar shape. This would most likely occur if a rotary, grinding motion was used. Two lines of evidence suggest that this was generally not the case. First, all of the ethnographic data on the processing of mesquite make it clear that the motion used was mainly pounding rather than grinding. Second, the use-wear striations on the large pestle illustrated in Figure 14b and the apparent impact spalls on several of the other Los Morteros pestles are strongly indicative of a vertical pounding motion. These hypotheses are not intended to be mutually exclusive. It is quite possible that in cases where a hard, irregularly shaped pestle was used, a motion consisting of both pounding and grinding could have been utilized and both could have been responsible for the resulting mortar shape. Another important consideration in this discussion of pestle hardness is the amount of rock debris that would be produced while processing food in a mortar. It is expected that the softer pestles (limestone, sandstone, welded tuffs, and so on) would produce a larger quantity of debitage than pestles that are close to the same hardness as the mortar rock. It is not intuitively obvious, however, whether harder pestles produce more or less rock material than mortars of approximately equal hardness. Data on the techniques of pounding and grinding as well as information on the extent of actual contact between pestle and mortar walls during processing is unfortunately lacking. Because it would have been possible to remove the bits of rock material by winnowing the meal, just as the unwanted seed coats were removed in many of the ethnographic accounts (Bell and Castetter 1937), it seems likely that given the preference for pestles with a similar hardness as the mortar rock, grinding efficiency was more important than the amount of rock residue in the meal.</page><page sequence="42">166 WALLACE Pestle Size and Shape The cache of two pestles associated with Rock Shelter 6 (see Chapter 3) is the only other example of pestles found associated with particular mortars at Los Morteros. As seen in Figures 15a and 15b, and Table 2, these pestles are ground only a short way from the use ends, correlating with the midrange size of the three mortars found in Rock Shelter 6. The pestle illustrated in Figure 15a fits two mortars and the specimen illustrated in Figure 15b fits the third. Whether this is a coincidence or whether one pestle was actually used in two .mortars is not known. When the use-wear lengths of these pestles are compared to those shown in Figure 16a and Figure 14b, it is evident that the pestles from the cache have a much longer unused length. This may be due to anticipation on the part of the owner(s) of their use in larger mortars. It is more plausible, however, that a larger pestle was used because it was more easily held and provided increased momentum to pound and crush. A single example of a handstone that was evidently used in a particular mortar was found during the Rillito Peak survey below MT-2. It is evident from the size and shape of the mortar on MT-2 (very wide in relation to its depth) and the amount of wear on the handstone, that this was the grinding implement most frequently employed during the final stages in the use of the mortar. This implies that the user was interested more in grinding or crushing than pounding. The anomalous diameter of Mortar MT-2 in relation to its depth indicates that this was not a common occurrence among the mortars at Los Morteros. The use of a handstone in a mortar may indicate a second stage of processing (fine grinding) or the grinding or crushing of a different kind of seed. Further evidence of multistage processing is discussed later in this chapter. The evidence at Los Morteros, then, seems to suggest that pestle hardness has a large role in determining the shape of a mortar, and that only pestles as hard or harder than the mortar rock were used. It also seems probable that the hard cobbles with irregularities or peculiar shapes produced elliptical mortars, and that these hard cobbles were not preferred as pestles. Out of convenience, they were probably used near their source. Pairing and Grouping One curious result of this study was the discovery of a tendency for pairs or groups of mortars, similar in size and shape, to occur on the same boulder or on separate, but adjacent boulders. Due to unclear or ambiguous spatial relation- ships in cases where large numbers of mortars occur close to one another, precise numbers and frequencies cannot be determined. Several informative examples are discussed below. Boulders MF-6 and MH-3 have typical examples of pairs occurring on single boulders. The two mortars on MF-6 are 10 cm deep by 18 cm in</page><page sequence="43">Rillito Peak 167 diameter, and 11 cm deep by 18 cm in diameter. Those on MH-3 are 6 cm by 17 cm and 6 cm by 16 cm. Boulder MS-4 provides an excellent example of a pair of mortars each with an elliptical orifice (a characteristic that is relatively un- common at Los Morteros). The measurements for both of these mortars are 13 cm by 17 cm (minimum) and 20 cm (maximum). Pairing of single mortars on adjacent boulders is illustrated by MF-9 (5 cm by 15 cm) and MF- 10(5 cm by 14 cm). Boulders MC-2, MC-3, and MC-4 provide another example, with three mortars closely matched in size on three adjacent boulders. Finally, boulder MK-2 contains a group of mortars closely matched in size (Figure 10). These examples lead to several, interesting insights into the behavior associated with the processing of mesquite. The numerous cases of pairing and grouping on single and adjacent boulders could easily be explained by either, or both, of the following two hypotheses. 1. Two or more individuals began and used a pair of mortars for the same period of time with similar pestles. Hayden (1969) and Felger and Moser ( 197 1), in describing the processing of mesquite by the Pima and Seri Indians, respectively, support this hypothesis. They point out that processing is often a social, possibly familial, activity involving several women. 2. A single person alternated the use of one pestle among several mortars. This hypothesis may imply ownership of particular mortars, though the authors feel that it is unlikely that an individual would have owned or used more than two mortars. If it is assumed that elliptical mortars are produced from the use of hard cobble pestles rather than any particular grinding motion, then the pairs of elliptical mortars on MS-4, MF-7, and MF-14 can be taken as evidence in support of hypothesis 2 at Los Morteros. One anecdotal ethnographic account relating to this hypothesis is given by Doelle (1976:54,59) on the processing technique used by Juanita Ahill, one of the few Papago women still grinding mesquite. He reports that Juanita used two mortars during processing. One mortar, after a single processing episode, was left to attract the many ants that had arrived. This was intended to keep them from the second mortar which was used to process the two subsequent batches of mesquite pods. Doelle notes that this pacification measure was largely ineffective. In light of the inefficiency of this ploy, Juanita's procedure may represent little more than a behavioral idiosyncracy. The groupings of large mortars on the intensive-use boulders may be more easily explained by a third hypothesis, complementary to the first two. 3. The growth rate of a mortar will asymptotically approach zero. This hypothesis relies on the assumption that once a mortar has reached a substantial</page><page sequence="44">168 WALLACE depth (25-30 cm), the pestle will no longer reach the bottom of the mortar with any appreciable frequency due, in part, to the large mass of mesquite being processed. This would slow the growth of the mortar to a minimum. Thus, the mortars that were not as deep would "catch up" with the deeper mortars, resulting in a number of large mortars of similar depths. This does not necessarily mean that there would be a functional end to the depth of a mortar, but rather that a mortar's growth slows appreciably as it reaches relatively large depths. Experimental or ethnographic data would be required to test this hypothesis. Though considered highly unlikely, one final hypothesis is offered as an explanation for pairing and grouping of mortars. 4. Two or more people used a single pestle in two or more mortars. No evidence is presently available to support this hypothesis. Aprons and Ground Depressions Smooth ground areas ("aprons") or ground depressions on or around the rims of the mortars are common at Los Morteros. Their distribution appears to be most closely tied to the size of the mortars with which they are associated, the deepest mortars having the highest frequency of aprons and ground depres- sions. The correlation of their frequency of occurrence with mortar depth most likely relates to the cumulative result of an activity that is performed during the use-life of the mortar. Aprons Because of their smooth, but somewhat irregular surface characteristics, aprons do not appear to have been functional in terms of grinding seeds, nor do they appear to be a result of smoothing the mortar rock to improve seating comfort. One suggestion is that they are the result of the gradual finishing of pestle shape. As Russell (1908:110) indicAtes in his discussion on Pima pestle manufacture, this process was "not all done at once but a suitable stone having been selected, it ... (was) ... shaped little by little, day by day, as the owner had leisure for the work." This task could easily be accomplished around the rim of the mortar in which it was being used. Another equally plausible suggestion, by no means exclusive of the first, is that the smoothed area would result from pestle cleaning. Mesquite, if not processed early in the season or without prior drying, produces a sticky, gummy residue on the surfaces of the pestle. If this residue was at all undesirable, it could be removed by a scraping or grinding motion around the rim of the mortar. This activity would also serve to help shape the pestle.</page><page sequence="45">Rillito Peak 169 Ground Depressions The small ground depressions (Figure 11; Frontispiece, lower) that often open into motars seem to be the result of either a systematic pestle cleaning technique or further reduction of the mesquite meal or other products obtained from processing in the mortar. In this vein, it is also possible that a special seed or plant was reduced in the depression and the mortar used as a temporary collection receptacle. The possibility that the depressions were used as pestle rests is considered remote as their shapes and locations with respect to the mortars do not fit this interpretation. Unfortunately, none of these hypotheses is testable with the Los Morteros data. Metates Twenty-seven boulder metates on seven boulders were recorded at Los Morteros during the Rillito Peak survey (Table 3). All were located either in the floodplain or along the base and lower eastern slope of Rillito Peak. Four of the seven boulders containing eighteen of the metates have been classified as intensive-use boulders. The spatial relationships .of metates to mortars is illustrated by two of these, Boulders MF-7 (Figure 11; Frontispiece, lower) and MK-2 (Figure 17). Table 3 shows that there is a two-to-one ratio of basin metates to trough or slab metates on these boulders. S0o0o o o000 N AT UR O * Cupule 0 Unclassfied Metote Figure 17.

In discussing the intricacies of wild seed processing, Eddy (1964:8) reports that: This shape of metate is well designed to confine light weight seeds and prevent them from flying out of the milling area. Also, the hard husks of many wild food seeds require considerable pounding to break them down into meal, and this can best be accomplished in a basin-shape receptacle. Both Russell (1908:75) and Bell and Castetter (1937:22) indicate that the Pima would reduce mesquite seeds into flour on a metate because they could not be ground efficiently in a mortar. So, combined with the evidence from Los Morteros, the best interpretation for the basin metates is that they were used for the second stage in the processing of mesquite. Slab and trough metates are located somewhat randomly in relation to the mortars. Their locations do not seem to indicate that they were used in the processing of mesquite. The large number of trough metates on MK-2 (Table 3) is easily explained if it is assuied that corn or some other domestic crop was being processed in them. MK-2 is located in a zone of probable dense habitaton and it is not unlikely that instead of making the typical portable trough metates, several households living near MK-2 simply used the available bedrock for their corn processing. This would seem to be an equally plausible explanation for the other boulders with trough or slab metates. Given this explanation one might wonder why the other boulders in the MK cluster or MS-7 do not have trough metates. It is obvious from inspection of these boulders that their particular topographies precluded the easy development or comfortable use of metates. Bedrock and boulder metates are present in association with mortars at many Hohokam sites in the Tucson area including all of the cerros de trincheras (based on inspection by the authors and ASM site files). Some of these are listed</page><page sequence="47">Rillito Peak 171 in Table 9. Portable metate fragments were mapped during the Tumamoc Hill survey (Larson 1979), but the boulder metates were not studied, making it impossible to draw comparisons with Los Morteros. A photograph in Weaver and Rosenberg's (1978:Figure 16) study on the petroglyphs of the Sierra Estrella indicates that the association of basin metates and mortars may be a widespread occurrence for the Hohokam. Discussion The importance of mesquite in the diet of the Pima and Papago in historic times has been well documented. This information, together with archaeological remains at numerous sites, indicates that it was also important in the subsistence of the Hohokam. With the ethnohistoric and ethnographic data on the use of mortars, and the environmental association at Los Morteros, there can be little question that mesquite pods were the resource processed in the numerous mortars at the site. At other sites occurring well away from expanses of suitable bedrock, it is probable, from the ethnohistoric accounts of the Pima, that wooden mortars were used, thus limiting the archaeologist's perception of the significance attached to the resource. At Los Morteros, with the food resource, bedrock, and habitation occurring in conjunction with one another, a better understanding of the prehistoric importance of mesquite is achieved. With 61 mortars over 15 cm in depth, most of which are grouped in discrete clusters, it is reasonable to infer that the processing of mesquite was an integral part of the local economy. If it is assumed that mesquite was a desirable commodity for villages located away from the mesquite bosque believed to have existed at Los Morteros, then it is probable that mesquite was either traded out to the sites from Los Morteros or that members of these communities traveled in to Los Morteros and gathered their own pods at the time of the harvest. Both practices have been documented ethnohistorically. Bell and Castetter (1937:22) report that mesquite in the form of pods and meal was traded by the Pima for "articles" from the Maricopa and Papago. This suggests that a village such as Los Morteros, with an abundance of mesquite, might process the pods in exchange for goods from other communities. Outlying settlements could have provided such varied items as shell, salt, rock, mineral products or raw material, or wild floral and faunal resources not readily obtained near the site. Bell and Castetter (1937:22) also document the seasonal travel of community groups for the purpose of gathering mesquite. Both practices could have resulted in a multivillage gathering during or immediately after the mesquite harvest, a possibility that may have played a significant role in determining the regional significance and development of the Los Morteros site. Other major sites occurring close to probable prehistoric mesquite bosques such as the</page><page sequence="48">172 WALLACE Martinez Hill Ruin (AZ BB: 13:3), the Hodges Site (AZ AA: 12:18), and the Hardy Site (AZ BB:9:14) may have been placed in a similar role. Because large amounts of bedrock were not available near these sites, processing may have been accomplished with the use of wooden mortars. An analysis of the numbers of stone pestles as well as flotation and palynological studies from these sites would be a means of testing the significance of mesquite there. Very little evidence at outlying settlements may be preserved if meal was traded or the processing undertaken at the bosques. As Johnson (1967:20-22) discovered in his work in the Comanche Reservoir district in California, the interpretation of population size and length of occupa- tion on the basis of the numbers and sizes of bedrock mortars, as proposed by Bennyhoff (1956), is hindered by the many assumptions it relies upon. Perhaps the most important of these is that suitable rock is present and used to the exclusion of wooden and, therefore, perishable mortars. The lack of experi- mental data, differences in the utilization of mesquite over time, multi- generational occupation, the possibility of multisite use of the mortars, and the processing of mesquite for exchange, are all factors that would make Bennyhoff's interpretations inapplicable to Hohokam settlements. Ethnographic and ethnohistoric information on the Pima and Papago make it clear that the gathering and processing of mesquite were seasonal activities occurring primarily at the time of the harvest. The storage of large quantities of unprocessed or partially processed pods implies that the processing of mesquite may have also occurred at least through the winter and possibly throughout the year. The distribution of mortars at Los Morteros indicates that the Hohokam followed similar routines. The midrange mortars that are spread across the site are most reasonably interpreted as resulting from the seasonal use of mesquite. Those that are found close to the intensive-use boulders could be interpreted as an indication that the numbers of pcrsons grinding mesquite increased during the period of the mesquite harvest. The concentrated groups of large mortars located on the intensive-use boulders may indicate that the processing of mesquite continued throughout the year in the most favorable localities. From all indications, the majority of mortar localities at Los Morteros were not field processing camps, but rather processing stations within or adjacent to zones of habitation. The clustering of mortars in particular areas at the site and the tendency for suitable working surfaces to contain a number of mortars, occasionally paired or grouped in size, is a strong indication that the processing of mesquite was a social activity involving familial or specific social groups. Writing over 60 years ago of the mortar boulders MK- I and MK-2, Huntington (1914:55) made a similar, if somewhat more poetic observation, "Long ago the Hohokam women must have gathered here with their stone pestles, and gossiped as they sat on the great rocks and pounded corn, beans, or</page><page sequence="49">Rillito Peak 173 other seeds to make flour for the daily bread of their primitive husbands and sons. CUPULES Spatial Distribution Cupule distribution is closely associated with the distribution of mortars at Los Morteros. As seen in Figure 6, boulders with cupules are found among most of the mortar clusters at the base of Rillito Peak, and are largely absent from the mortar clusters found near the summit. In addition, cupules are found throughout the MK cluster and are associated with the ML cluster in the central and southern portions of Los Morteros.* Seventy-seven percent of the Los Morteros cupules occur in association with the mortar clusters in the floodplain portion of the site in areas with limited available bedrock and probable nearby habitation (MK cluster and MS-7). Over half of the cupules are situated on two boulders in this zone: MK- I with 158 (Figure 18), and MS-7 with 241 (Figure 19). Both of these boulders are tall and rounded with relatively uncomfortable surfaces on which to work. Most of the cupules occur on the tops of these boulders (as is the case for most others at the site) where they are packed so closely together, that in many cases, the edges of one cupule impinge on the edges of several others. However, a number of cupules are also located along the sloping edges, vertical sides, and even under slight overhangs on these boulders. The only other sizeable concentration of cupules at Los Morteros (18 percent) is located in the MF cluster where they are concentrated on MF-8. This is a relatively small boulder that rests on top of the large bedrock exposure of MF-7 on Rillito Peak (Figure 1 1; Frontispiece, lower). As can be seen in Table 4, there is a dramatic difference in the utilization of these boulders. Large mortars (inferred to have been used for the processing of mesquite pods) are restricted to MF-7, together with associated aprons, ground depressions, and basin metates. In contrast, sizeable numbers of cupules and the only small mortars are located on MF-8. Even the working position of the user would differ for separate boulders. It is much easier to stand alongside MF-8 to work, while on MF-7, one would most likely be seated. Cupules occur in conjunction with the trincheras mortars to a very limited degree. In general, they are absent from the upper slopes and summit of Rillito Peak and they are similarly lacking among the trincheras at Rattlesnake Pass. They were found to have only minimal association with cultural features other *Note that nine cupules in the MA cluster and two on MS-2 were recorded too late to be added to the statistics. Their location is, however, shown in Figure 6.</page><page sequence="50">174 WALLACE Petroglyph O O* P Q. p*onl 0 o o 0 0 Petroglyph 0panelo 1.Om .5 0 LOre 0 Mortar 0 Cupule Figure 18.

Although petroglyph distribution overlaps that of mortars and cupules at Los Morteros (see Figure 35), cupules are generally found to be very near or on the boulders having mortars and seem to be only generally associated with the petroglyphs. The boulders in the MK-PG cluster are the only significant exceptions to this rule. Size As seen in Figures 8 and 20, cupule depths range from less than 1.0 cm to 3.0 cm with 94 percent 1.0 cm deep or less. Diameters range from 2.0 cm to 8.0 cm.

Small mortars, in contrast, are defined as having been made with a larger, more round-ended stone, which produces a wider, flatter depression. 0 A comparison of the sizes of cupules and small mortars (Figures 8 and 2 1) reveals a large degree of overlap in depths, though they appear to be differen- tiated by their diameters. The statistics do not indicate a significant distinction between the sizes of cupules and small mortars, and it is important to note here that shape is the only distinct difference. However, we believe that this is significant due to the functional interpretations that have been cited in the literature. Cupules and small mortars are, therefore, analyzed separately. Interpretations Previous Hypotheses The small, mortarlike depressions found at Los Morteros have been designated as "cupules" in this report due to the strong resemblances to those described by Minor (1975) and others (including Hedges 1973; Fink 1979; and Knight 1979) in California as a distinctive type of petroglyph style frequently referred to as the Pit-and-Groove style (see Minor 1975 for a good summary of the literature). This style name is somewhat of a misnomer as only a small proportion of the sites have the "grooves," and as noted in the introduction to this chapter, the term "cupule" is the currently recommended term. Although several of the authors mentioned above have noted that the cupules rarely display any design or pattern, and that they frequently occur at campsites or rockshelters in association with bedrock mortars and metates (for example, Minor 1975:Plate 5), no hypotheses have been offered by these California archaeologists beyond a ceremonial interpretation of them as a petroglyph style. Schaafsma (1980) has also opted for a nonutilitarian interpretation for cupules at the sites of Painted Rocks (AZ S: 16: 1) and Picture Rocks (AZ AA: 12:62) in Arizona. Rather than defining them as petroglyphs. Schaafsma (1980:96-97) correlates the cupules (she calls them "pits") with the distribution of Hohokam petroglyphs. She speculates that they may have been</page><page sequence="53">Rillito Peak 177 OEPTH CUPU L ES (617) MORTARS I 4J (304) DIAMETER CUPULES (617) MORTARS (305) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50cm Figure 20.

Another possible functional interpretation she offers is their use for holding prayer sticks, making the areas in which they are found the center of ritual activity (Schaafsma 1980:96-97). These interpretations seem untenable in light of the data from Los Morteros. If their most important function is related to some form of ceremo- nialism associated with petroglyphs, then it should be expected that cupules would occur with the greatest frequency in association with the two largest clusters of petroglyphs, PA and PN. However, only four of the 617 cupules recorded occurred within the boundaries of these petroglyph clusters and over a third of all cupules were located on a single boulder (MS-7), which was not associated with any petroglyphs. It should also be pointed out that at the present time, there have been no archaeologically documented cases of painting over Hohokam petroglyphs. If the practice was as widespread as Schaafsma seems to be suggesting, evidence in sheltered areas such as in Rock Shelter 4 should still be sufficiently preserved for documentation. No such evidence has yet been located. Among Hohokam archaeologists, cupules have often been assumed to be "starts" for bedrock mortars, as the co-occurrence of these features in close proximity has been recognized in southern Arizona for some time. Larson (1979:77) has pointed to the problems with this interpretation for the cupules occurring on Tumamoc Hill. Their tendency to cluster close to one another (as is the case at Los Morteros) and to mortars precludes their being mortar "starts." Larson states that he was unable to derive a testable hypothesis to explain them at Tumamoc, though he speculates that they may have been used for grinding small quantities of some special seed, or that they were "merely the result of children at play, copying the activities of their parents on the large mortar holes" (Larson 1979:77). Another utilitarian hypothesis is offered for cupulelike features found on a boulder in the Lonesome Valley Ruin, Yavapai County, Arizona, by Fianklin Barnett. He suggests (1973:15) that they served as "firestarts," a hypothesis engendered by the specific context in a pueblo room and a similar case at another ruin. Hypotheses from the Los Morteros Data Two hypotheses were developed from the data gathered in Phase I of the Rillito Peak survey regarding the function of cupules at Los Morteros. The first related to Larson's suggestion that some kind of special seeds may have been ground in them (Larson 1979:77).</page><page sequence="55">Rillito Peak 179 1. Cupules were utilized in the grinding or pounding of some type of wild plant resource such as herbs or medicinal plants. This hypothesis suggests that cupule placement would be similar to that for mortars. For example, a level working surface, a location near the resource being exploited (given suitable rock), or to a zone of habitation would be important. Hypothesis I is not supported from the data at Los Morteros. Seven of the 31 cupule boulders had cupules positioned on sloping surfaces ranging from 35 degrees to completely vertical faces and even overhangs. It seems highly unlikely that anything could have been pounded in these cupules as the manufactured product would spill from the slanted depression and be lost. Furthermore, it has been noted that the distribution of cupules closely approximates that of mortars. If the mortars do indicate mesquite processing stations, the close association of cupules and mortars suggests that the activities producing the cupules are in some way related to the processing of mesquite. This conclusion has led the authors to develop a second hypothesis. 2. Cupules are the result of pestle manufacture. This hypothesis rests on several assumptions. As the most important surface for grinding or pounding in a mortar is the surface at the end of the pestle that does the actual grinding and pounding, it is necessary to round off this surface when manufacturing a pestle. This could be initially accomplished through the use of a hammerstone to remove major flakes of undesirable rock (Russell 1975:110), but once a roughly hewn tip has been produced, a hammerstone would become inefficient. It would then be necessary to pound the end of the pestle with sufficient force to round the surface by pulverizing the unwanted material, rather than by flaking. It would be much easier to pound the end of the pestle on a boulder, using the weight of the pestle for momentum. Although this action could most easily be performed on level or slanted surfaces that one can stand or sit beside, it could also be accomplished on vertical faces. Once the tip of a pestle is rounded, it is assumed that at least one depression identical in form to a cupule will be produced. A second assumption is that there will be a definite maximum functional depth for these depressions. As the cupules increase in depth, they will tend to become less and less efficient for producing the rounded end on a pestle due to the deflecting tendency of the cupule rim on the end of the pestle. Without experimental data it is impossible to be sure how many cupules would result from the manufacture of a single pestle, or how deep a cupule should be; however, it is possible to propose some suggestions. The relative hardness of pestle and pounding surfaces is thought to be very important. As discussed above, pestles are expected to be made of material as hard or harder than the pounding surface. If both pestle and pounding surface are composed of rock of roughly the same hardness, it is expected that the resulting cupules</page><page sequence="56">180 WALLACE would be relatively wide and shallow, and continuous pounding at a single locality should also be possible. In contrast, very hard pestles, in relation to the pounding surface should result in deeper, narrower depressions, and more cupules should be produced to completely round the pestle tip. The hypothesis further suggests that once a degree of blunting at the tip is achieved, it may be desirable to round the end by grinding in a slightly larger depression. Such a depression would only need to be as large as the newly formed blunt end on the pestle and would be expected to occur in the same areas where cupules are found in numbers. By the definitions used here to differentiate mortars and cupules, these wider depressions, showing the use of a relatively smooth, blunt-ended tool would be classified as mortars. Though not as numerous as cupules, their distribution at Los Morteros does follow the anticipated pattern. Mortars 2.5 cm in depth or less (small mortars) generally do follow the same distribution as cupules and they are generally absent in outlying 'areas with very few cupules. The hypothesis developed above can be evaluated in terms of four test implications. These are examined individually in terms of the data from Los Morteros. 1. Cupules should occur most frequently at sites where suitable raw material is available for the manufacture of pestles, but local geological conditions preclude the possibility of finding nicely rounded pestles not requiring modification. Although river cobbles are present to a limited extent along the Santa Cruz River near Rillito Peak, it is difficult to find stones not requiring some modification. Eight of the 12 pestles found at Los Morteros had been noticeably altered through intentional shaping. The locally available andesite was the preferred material in this sample. 2. If pestle manufacture is concurrent with the processing of mesquite, then cupules should occur in the immediate vicinity of mortars. This would be expected if it was a common pract'ce to bring a roughly hewn pestle to the mortars to finish the pestle's working surfaces. This might include fitting the pestle to a particular mortar and socializing with others working at a mortar rock. Finishing might also occur when a pestle broke during use. It has been demonstrated that the spatial distribution of the cupules at Los Morteros is closely related to the distribution of mortars, supporting this test implication. 3. Cupules should be located near to, but not actually on the favorable working areas for the pounding of mesquite. This is expected if it can be assumed that the debris produced by pounding and the resultant irregularities in the surface of the rock would be undesirable at the processing locality. This implication is borne out at Los Morteros, though the degree to which a particular area was used as</page><page sequence="57">Rillito Peak 181 predicted was found to be related primarily to the availability of suitable rock for the placement of mortars. In the mountainous portions of the site, the predicted separation of cupule and mortar locations occurred almost without exception. Boulders MF-7 and MF-8, discussed above, are perhaps the best examples. In the floodplain, where suitable rock for the placement of mortars is restricted to a few limited locations, mortars and cupules occur together, though the overall pattern still prevails. MK- I and MK-2, two boulders located close to one another in the floodplain, and having the largest number of mortars and cupules in their cluster, differ in their ratios of mortars to cupules. Table 4 illustrates the fact that the least suitable boulder, MK- 1, has a much larger ratio of cupules to mortars than MK-2, the most suitable boulder in the MK cluster. 4. Cupules should be distributed in groups or clusters if it can be assumed that the manufacture of a single pestle would require more than one cupule. This clustering has been demonstrated to be the pattern for Los Morteros in the preceding section. An example of this is Trinchera 89. Two cupules are present on a single small boulder (MJ-2) adjacent to a boulder containing a mortar (MJ-3). From the limited use that this mortar's size suggests, it is reasonable to infer that the two cupules are the result of the manufacture of the pestle used in this mortar. 5. If areas with large numbers of cupules are representative of the manufacture of many pestles, debitage from the initial flaking of pestle "blanks" should be located nearby (assuming that the differing stages of manufacture were carried out at one locality). Pestles broken during the process of manufacture should also occasionally be found. This test implication is difficult to evaluate with the present data from Los Morteros as the areas near the largest concentrations of cupules in the floodplain portion of the site have been impacted to the extent that no interpretations of the surface context can be made. However, at MF-8 the only major undisturbed concentration of cupules, a sizeable quantity of small flakes of the local andesite is scattered around the boulder. As naturally occurring debris should not be found near MF-8, it is suggested that this may be the debitage from initial flaking. Although broken pestles were found in the vicinity, none is the result of manufacturing activities as they all exhibit extensive use wear. Two additional suggestions relating to cupule use have been offered by Richard Lange of the Arizona State Museum. The first is that the cupules might represent the "roughing" of the end of a pestle to facilitate better grinding. This seems unlikely in light of the techniques employed to roughen manos for the grinding of corn. In that case, the use of hammerstones for this purpose has been well-documented ethnographically (Eddy 1964), and it is believed that a similar technique could be most efficiently applied to pestles, if necessary. The</page><page sequence="58">182 WALLACE fact that pestles seem to have been used primarily as pounders, rather than as grinding implements, may mean that this technique was not required. The second suggestion concerns the sticky quality of green mesquite pods. Lange reasons that cupules might be produced if it were necessary to clean off the ends of the pestles. Such cleaning could serve as an explanation of some of the larger, shallow cupules though it would not explain the full range of shapes and sizes of cupules. Rather than cupules, it seems more probable that cleaning would produce the aprons discussed earlier. If cupules were the result of pestle manufacture, it follows that most cupules should be located in habitation areas that have associated mortars. The concentration of cupules in the MK cluster serves to illustrate this point. This means that the raw material for pestles was gathered (and possibly roughly shaped) and then brought into the habitation area for final shaping prior to use. Once shaped into workable pestles, they may have been very valuable tools that were limited in ownership. The pestle cache associated with the mortars in Rockshelter 6 tends to support this interpretation. Discussion Through an examination of the physical attributes, spatial distribution and correlation with the cultural environment, the authors have determined that the most likely explanation for the function of the cupules at Los Morteros is that they were a byproduct in the manufacture of stone pestles. This interpretation may have particular importance to archaeologists working in southern California where cupules similar to those at Los Morteros have been interpreted as petroglyphs having ceremonial significance (Minor 1975). A brief examination of some of the reports that describe cupule sites and those that have examined large bedrock mortar sites (such as Payen and Boloyan 1963), indicates that a similar functional interpretation may be applicable to those sites. It is hoped that this report will stimulate an examination of this possibility. It has also been demonstrated that the small mortars that frequently occur in association with the cupules may be a product of the final shaping of these pestles and though some may have been used for the grinding of plant resources, many may not have been used in food production.</page><page sequence="59">THE KIVA, Vol. 48, No. 3 Spring 1983 Chapter 3 TRINCHERAS, ROCK SHELTERS, AND OTHER ROCKWORK FEATURES Contrary to general expectations, the slopes and summit of Rillito Peak exhibit a wide range of prehistoric features. Ninety-eight trincheras of varied types, seven well-used rock shelters, and a variety of other rockwork features including talus pits and check dams were discovered. TRINCHERAS FEATURES The trincheras on the mountains north of Rattlesnake Pass along the southwestern boundary of the Los Morteros Site have been known for at least 70 years since Ellsworth Huntington first visited the site in 1910 (Huntington 1912:134). Though not more than a mile away, Rillito Peak has remained unexplored by the few archaeologists who have examined the distribution and complexities of trincheras sites. Sauer and Brand (193 1) originally applied the term "trincheras" to the massive walls and adjacent terraces that cover the slopes of mountains in several areas of northern Sonora and southern Arizona. These sites have frequently been interpreted as defensive in nature on the basis of the revetmentlike walls that gave them their name. The Rillito Peak trincheras are generally small and curvilinear without terraces and the revetmentlike walls described for sites such as Tumamoc (Wilcox 1979) and Black Mountain (Fontana and others 1959). The following discussion on the Rillito Peak trincheras does not attempt to test systematically each of the numerous hypotheses that have been proposed to explain their occurrence at other sites; this would have been well beyond the scope of the survey. Instead, measurable surface attributes and artifacts are used to document the general range of variation and distribution on Rillito Peak in order to provide a sounder basis for designing future research. In addition, this research was structured to provide a body of data that could be compared with the more intensive Arizona State Museum investigations underway on the trincheras north of Rattlesnake Pass. 183</page><page sequence="60">184 WALLACE Methods A major obstacle to the interpretation of trincheras in the past has been the difficulty involved in developing meaningful classificatory schemes. The term "trincheras" has been used to describe a wide range of rockwork features and. has come to stand for practically any structure built of stone on a mountain. As such, it does have some general descriptive utility, as the term lacks specific functional connotations and is, therefore, appropriate when function is uncertain. It is retained in this report for reference to a wide range of rockwork features including what have been called corrales (Hinton 1955:2), sleeping circles and rock circles (Ezell 1954; Fontana and others 1959; Larson 1972, 1979), terraces, rock alignments, and cleared areas. A host of agricultural terms such as check dams, gridded fields, and rock piles (for example, see Masse 1979) could conceivably be considered in the definition of trincheras, but due to their less ambiguous nature, they are kept separate here. As the functions of many of the features encountered are problematic, the most important criterion for any classificatory scheme must be the clear definition of the attributes used in classification. In this study, the author has attempted to avoid terms with functional connotations like "terrace" and "sleeping circle." Instead the basic typology is reliant on interior shape and wall structure as follows: Circular - round cleared area surrounded by low rock walls or dirt embankments Oval - oval cleared area surrounded by low rock walls or dirt embankments Linear - linear cleared area with or without discernible walls Rectangular - rectangular cleared area surrounded by walls with definite structural corners present. Due to constraints on time and resources, it has not been possible to record the Rillito Peak trincheras in great detail. Without high resolution aerial photographs taken from a low altitude, it was impossible to map each of the structures as Larson (1972) attempted on Tumamoc Hill. The available aerial photograph was, however, adequate for recording the locations of each trinchera. This allows at least a comparative view of the distribution by type and their relationships to other features of the cultural and natural landscape. Measurements of the interior of each trinchera were taken to define the size. The interior was chosen due to the problems in defining the exterior in cases where erosion and collapse had occurred. This was mainly a problem for the oval and linear trincheras located on sloping surfaces. When precise measurements were impossible, lengths and widths were measured to the nearest 0.5 m.</page><page sequence="61">Rillito Peak 185 Wall height was an extremely difficult variable to measure with precision due to varied degrees of preservation and the frequently haphazard method of construction. It was recorded to provide information on current structural characteristics and was not intended to be a true representation of original height. The possibility that many of the "walls" may actually be the rubble resulting from clearing terraces argues for extreme caution in interpreting the data. Heights were taken from the current interior surface level to the maximum laid stone height (Figure 22). No calculations of slope angles, average heights, or widths of walls and revetments as described by Wilcox (1979:24-27) were taken. It was believed that interpretations from measurements of this-nature might be extremely misleading without the supportive data from excavation to determine their true structural composition and the extent of erosion. Associated artifacts, bedrock mortars, and petroglyphs were recorded when applicable. To be termed "associated," artifacts had to be within a two meter radius of the exterior of a trinchera as defined in this survey. Because the trincheras appeared to be patterned with a trimodal distribution, associated ceramics and lithics were recorded as follows: (1) absent, (2) less than ten, and (3) eleven or more. Time did not permit complete artifact counts per trinchera, though such a measure is strongly recommended for future investigators.

Mortars and petroglyphs were recorded as described in Chapters 2 and 4. Results A surprisingly high density of trincheras was encountered on the upper slopes and summit of Rillito Peak. Although large amounts of raw data are not usually presented in a final report, the lack of any previous efforts to systematically measure and record significant associations for individual trincheras argues for as complete a presentation as possible. Therefore, a complete listing of the 98 trincheras recorded with individual measurements and associated artifacts is given in Table 5. Summary statistics follow in Table 6. An additional 10 to 30 trincheras were present, but were considered too amorphous for adequate definition. Of the five types recorded, oval and circular trincheras were the most abundant, making up 77 percent of the sample (Table 7). Of the remainder, 27 percent are linear and only 5 percent could be classed as rectangular. Intentional, aboveground, dry-laid masonry walls over two boulders high were observed in oval, circular, and rectangular trincheras; however, the walls were usually only one boulder in height. None of the structures had walls over a meter in height. A major obstacle in the interpretation of trincheras structures lies in distinguishing intentionally constructed walls from piles of stone that have been formed secondarily as the result of clearing activities. While one person may see a wall in a particular trinchera, another may see a cleared space. Likewise, for many of the linear trincheras with very low wall heights, it is impossible to tell whether the level platform visible today is a result of erosion or a result of intentional construction of a retaining wall with imported soil. Although test excavations were not conducted, depth appeared considerable in many cases. Spatial Distribution Trincheras are generally distributed in groups or clusters of 2 to 33 in spatially discrete zones on Rillito Peak (Figure 23). In several of the cases where isolated trincheras were observed, others were suspected in the area but were too poorly defined to record. As seen in Figure 23, the vast majority are located on the level or gently sloping surfaces of the upper eastern and northeastern slopes of the mountain. Nearly all level areas atop the mountain have been utilized to some extent. The largest cluster, (TB) containing 33 trincheras, is connected to the next largest cluster, (TA) with 13 trincheras, by what may have been an aboriginal trail.

See text. refurbishing and remodeling has unfortunately limited their interpretive potential. The Rillito Peak trincheras are clustered in groups of multiple types (the only exception, Cluster TF, is discussed below). All of the clusters include trincheras that are circular or oval, but not all have linear trincheras. Five very large (up to 12 m across) oval and circular trincheras were encountered in the largest relatively level areas on Rillito Peak. Four occur in Cluster TB and another is located nearby. Associated artifacts include low to high densities of sherds and lithics and one small discoidal mano. Similar features were seen on the level summits of mountains just north of Rattlesnake Pass. The possibility that these features may be functionally different from other trincheras should be considered in the future. Two clusters of trincheras, TF and TJ, have features that set them apart from the others in this study. Cluster TF consists of six small oval and circular trincheras located on a narrow flat-topped saddle northwest of Rillito Peak. A light scatter of lithic flakes covers the area and a petroglyph that may or may not be historic is nearby. The absence of any pottery or other implements suggests that this was a limited activity locus. Cluster TJ, situated in the saddle above Point of Mountain adjacent to Rock Shelter 3, petroglyph Cluster PN, and the jasper quarry on the west slope (Feature 1), consists of trincheras that are structurally different from the others on Rillito Peak. Rather than having the appearance of a cleared area enclosed or supported by rubble walls, those in Cluster TJ resemble small craters excavated</page><page sequence="68">192 WALLACE vo %E x' 0 0o 0&lt; U3 0 0 e w ca 0r 06 0 i V I o.. or I ~~o x x . l. o u .jr, . x u . 1. in 0c 0t cw .- a 4. : E .c cc F- rr)"i C c -cc 0 a n Ic I 0 0 0 A; Figure 23.

The "walls" are mere embankments of earth with occasional rocks rather than true masonry. Wall heights for these trincheras are actually depths, taken from the central depression to the top of the surrounding embankments. None is over 0.5 m deep. It is apparent that other trincheras that may not have had this craterlike appearance existed in the level central portion of the saddle. However, it was not possible to discern their original structure and their origin is problematic. As noted above, the area was used extensively by the Hohokam, but the presence of a mining prospect hole at least 50 years old and a variety of historic trash scattered throughout the area indicates that these trincheras may date to the historic use of the mountain. They may be historic prospect holes or they might be the foundations of historic Papago houses. Without text excavation, it is impossible to be certain. However, the scatter of Hohokam ceramics, jasper flakes from the adjacent quarry, and several hammerstones suggest a prehistoric origin. Rock shelters and sheltered areas adjacent to large boulders or bedrock outcrops are frequently incorporated into or added to the trincheras on Rillito Peak. Those that do include bedrock, large boulders, or rock shelters as a portion of their structure tend to have associated pottery and lithics. Perhaps the clearest example of this type of association is Trinchera 88 shown in Figure 24.

Rock Shelters 6 and 7, showing Trinchera 88, the pestle cache, associated mortars and a single cupule.</page><page sequence="70">194 WALLACE This trinchera is situated at the mouth of Rock Shelter 6 in Trinchera Cluster TB. The association is particularly interesting due to the mortars in Rock Shelter 6 and a cache of two pestles found in a crevice beneath several boulders in the wall of the trinchera. As one pestle fits one of the three rock shelter mortars and the other pestle fits the other two, it seems reasonable to assume that the same people were using both the trinchera and the rock shelter. Although there are scattered sherds and lithics in the vicinity and in nearby Rock Shelter 7, the small size of both of the shelters and the lack of extensive trash deposits indicate limited use. Both rock shelters could have served as camp sites and areas to escape from the midday sun (they were a relief during survey). If this was the case, then a nondomestic explanation for the trinchera is implied. Associated Artifacts, Mortars, and Petroglyphs In terms of overall frequency, ceramics and lithic flakes are the predominant artifacts among the trincheras on Rillito Peak. A full 60 percent of the trincheras had associated ceramics. Although pottery is not generally dense, localized concentrations do approach the densities found in association with habitation structures on the floodplain. Decorated pottery is extremely rare and when it does occur, it is in association with the locally dense concentrations of plainware sherds. Only two locations with densities that would suggest trash deposits and some accumulated depth were noted. In Cluster TA, apparent trash deposits and a scatter of sherds and lithics are associated with large oval and rectangular trincheras (Nos. 10 and 11); these have well-demarcated, intentionally stacked masonry walls. Unfortunately, both have been recently altered, although in the rectangular enclosure one side of the original wall remains untouched. Trash deposits near these structures contained five sherds of Tanque Verde Red-on- brown, indicating Classic period occupation. A small, circular mano, a boulder with a ground depression, and several hammerstones occur in the vicinity. In Cluster TB, one oval (No. 51) and two circular (Nos. 52, 53) trincheras are associated with relatively high densities of sherds and lithics. As in Cluster TA, these structures are larger than average. No decorated ceramics were located, although several unidentified redwares are present. A small quartzite mano was found in one of these structures. Also in Cluster TB, oval Trinchera 61 has a relatively high sherd density but no associated lithics. Lithic flakes were associated with 37 percent of the Rillito Peak trincheras. The vast majority of this material is reddish-brown jasper similar to that found in the large quarry (Feature 1) described later in this chapter. In general, lithics follow the same distribution as ceramics among the trincheras. Hammerstones occur with nine of the trincheras. All are made from imported river cobbles used without significant modification. A full third of</page><page sequence="71">Rillito Peak 195 these are found in association with the linear trincheras. This is a higher number than should be expected given the frequency of this trinchera shape, although the sample is small. Many other hammerstones were encountered within and between the clusters of trincheras that did not occur in direct association with any of the structures. Bedrock mortars are associated with six of the eight clusters and 15 percent of the total number of trincheras. Over half are located in Trincheras Cluster TB, the largest on the mountain. Although not all trincheras or clusters of trincheras have associated mortars, when mortars occur on the upper slopes of Rillito Peak they are consistently related to the trincheras and rock shelters. As seen in Table 7, mortars are more consistently associated with the circular trincheras than would be expected given a random distribution, and less often associated with linear trincheras. This distribution mirrors to some extent the distribution of ceramics among the shape categories. The distribution of trincheras and petroglyphs are almost mutually exclu- sive. This remarkable lack of correlation may be of considerable importance if one takes into account other cerros de trincheras in the Tucson area. If Rattlesnake Pass is excluded, each of the other localities [Tumamoc Hill (AZ AA: 16:6), Martinez Hill (AZ AA: 13:2), and Black Mountain (AZ AA: 16:12)] has petroglyphs that are located among the trincheras. The possibility of true functional differences between the trincheras in these areas and Los Morteros should be considered. Discussion The varied shapes and sizes of the Rillito Peak trincheras, the type and presence or absence of associated artifacts, and other cultural features strongly suggest multiple activities relating to their use and construction. Functional interpretations derived from the data include temporary housing and dry farming. No evidence for a defensive motivation was found, although the mere presence of possible shelters or dwellings on the mountain slope could be interpreted as defensive. Temporary, seasonal, or sporadic use of the circular trincheras as shelters or dwellings is strongly indicated by the associated mortars and pottery. The presence of mortars implies that occupation occurred at least during the period of the mesquite harvest (late summer and fall), suggesting that mesquite or palo verde beans were ground in them. Evidence in support of this assumption was presented in Chapter 2. If the interpretation is correct, it can be assumed that people were spending at least a day at a time on the mountain or it would not have been necessary to bring food or to manufacture mortars and pestles for the preparation of food. The fact that most of the circular trincheras appear to represent temporary occupancy could be explained if short term population</page><page sequence="72">196 WALLACE influxes occurred along the base of Rillito Peak. With two other very large Classic period sites located within a few kilometers of Rillito Peak at AZ AA: 12:73 and AZ AA: 12:118, it seems likely that a population influx would have occurred during the times of the mesquite harvests - the bosque at the foot of the mountain and the bedrock mortars being indisputable lures. If habitation zones already covered the available land at the base of the mountain next to the bosque, the mountain slopes would be the only nearby areas on which to live. Further support of this inference comes from the recent excavation of two large trincheras features (one oval and one circular) located in an area of trincheras north of Rattlesnake Pass (Downum and others 198 1). Both of these features were found to be Hohokam pit houses with plastered hearths and the remains of jacal superstructures. They are dated to the Tanque Verde phase. Another possible interpretation related to the mesquite harvest would be that some of the trincheras were used for storage, perhaps of mesquite gathered during the harvest. Linear trincheras contrast markedly with the other types in having lower frequencies of associated pottery, much lower frequencies of associated lithic flakes, and seldom any associated mortars. They have a higher frequency of associated hammerstones than do the other types of trincheras. These factors together with less obvious differences, such as the apparently greater average depth of soil, imply small-scale dry farming rather than habitation. This hypothesis is undergoing extensive testing by Paul Fish of the Arizona State Museum for some of the Rattlesnake Pass trincheras. Contrary to the observa- tions of Sauer and Brand (1931:119-120), Hoover (1941:231), and Wilcox (1979:27), most of the linear trincheras on Rillito Peak do have sufficient soil for cultivation. Huntington (1914:69) may have had the right idea when he suggested the cultivation of specialized crops although he has been harshly criticized for this idea. Sauer and Brand, speaking of his suggestion, say: "One might suggest, however, the cultivation of peyote or of a pre-Columbian marijuana to produce more effectively the hallucinations necessary for such strange endeavor" (Sauer and Brand 1931:120-12 1). At the risk of incurring similar ridicule, it is suggested here that a specialized crop such as Yucca or Agave (neither of whico presently exists in the area) could have been grown in this type of environment. Several studies indicate the possible advantages of mountain slope cultivation. Spaulding (1909) and Hastings and Turner (1965) demonstrate a longer growing season and a high moisture-retentive capacity of mountain slopes as opposed to the valley floor. Paleoecologist Julio Betancourt has suggested that a study of pack rat middens might provide significant information for the evaluation of this hypothesis in addition to soil, palynologi- cal, and plant macrofossil studies. If this idea gained support, the circular trincheras could be interpreted as the field houses of mountain farmers.</page><page sequence="73">Rillito Peak 197 The largest percentage of the trincherds are oval in shape and have moderate quantities of associated artifacts. Their variability in size and structure makes it difficult to derive any single functional interpretation; this category may, in fact, include trincheras that served a variety of different functions. Those with a great deal of artifactual material and associated mortars may have been related to habitation. Others may have been used for dry farming or storage. Additional study and excavations will be required to sort out the most reasonable hypotheses. "Rectangular trincheras are not treated in depth here as the best examples have been historically altered. However, artifact associations seem to indicate a habitational interpretation for them. ROCK SHELTERS Seven rock shelters with evidence of prehistoric occupation were located on Rillito Peak. All but one of the shelters are on the eastern slopes and summit of the mountain (Figure 23). The exception, Rock Shelter 2, represents the only evidence of occupation on the west side of Rillito Peak. As might be expected, the shelters vary considerably.

Of the two shelters that may contain deep fills, Rock Shelter I appears to hold the greatest promise for deep, stratified deposits. Historic reoccupation has occurred in Rock Shelters 2, 3, and 7, and campfire remains and small historic walls were noted. OTHER ROCKWORK FEATURES Lithic Quarry Small chipping stations where jasper was flaked from small veins and outcrops occur in scattered localities on Rillito Peak. These ephemeral remnants of prehistoric activity were not individually recorded. The only major quarrying locality is Feature I shown in Figure 23. It extends for several hundred meters from the western edge of the saddle above Point of Mountain down the western slope. The most intensive use is on the upper third of the slope where boulders of reddish-brown jasper are eroding from the slope. Small flakes and debitage are densely scattered and boulders of jasper, which have been pounded and flaked to such an extent that none of the original surface remains, are common. Small hammerstones are distributed throughout the zone of intensive use. According to Bruce Huckell of the Arizona State Museum, the jasper that was worked at this locality is not of high chipping quality, as it fractures in many random cleavage planes. It is suitable for scraping and cutting implements but would not generally have been chosen for the fine chipping of a projectile point. The extent and quantity of lithic flakes indicate that the area was, however, heavily exploited. The jasper from Feature 1 is quite distinctive and would be easily recognized in archaeological contexts. Jasper similar to that at Feature I has been found in excavation at Los Morteros and on the surface at AZ AA: 12:118 and at AZ AA: 12:251 several kilometers away. Talus Pits Hartmann and Hartmann (1979:58-60) describe several dozen "rock pits" that occur in the talus on the northern and western slopes of Tumamoc Hill. The pits average 0.5 to I m deep by 1 to 2 m across, and it is noted that ceramics are occasionally found in or near them in otherwise culturally sterile zones. Hartmann and Hartmann (1979) suggest that they may have been used as hunting blinds for animals crossing the exposed, rocky slopes. Two pits similar to those described were found on Rillito Peak. It is suggested that to avoid confusion in the future these features be referred to as talus pits as they must by definition occur in a talus context and the term "rock pits" could easily be misconstrued to mean cupules or mortars.</page><page sequence="75">Rillito Peak 199 The pits at Los Morteros are both located on the upper northeastern slope along the lower edge of a fractured cliff face (Figure 23). Both are 1.5 m deep with one measuring 1.5 m across, the other measuring 2.0 m across at the mouth. No artifacts were associated with either one. The purpose for one of these at Los Morteros may have been to reach a seep spring (now dry), indicated by calcareous deposits. It is difficult to accept their function as hunting blinds on Rillito Peak due to the lack of any major game trails. To the author similar features at the Blackstone Ruin (AZ AA: 15:1) appear defensive due to their association with other probable defensive works, although other functions may be equally valid. However, the lack of any such defensive features at Los Morteros or other sites such as AZ AA:7:43 in the Samaniego Hills argues against defensive explanations for all of them. No single hypothesis seems adequate at the present time to explain these features. Check Dams Finally, two sets of possible check dams are located in two separate washes on the central portion of the northeastern slope of Rillito Peak (see Figure 23). Both sets are situated across steep-graded washes with channels averaging over 6 m across and 2 m deep with sharply angled sides. The dams average 3 to 4 m across and 1 m high. They consist of small (a few tens of centimeters) to large (greater than one meter) boulders stacked in the bottoms of the washes. Three dams are located in each of the two washes. The lack of any soil deposited behind them and their location on these steep, major washes indicates that they most likely were constructed to slow runoff and control erosion on the lower slope. It is unfortunate that any agricultural systems at the base of the slope that may have been related to these features would have been destroyed by the ADOT haul road and recent flooding of the Santa Cruz River. The presence of several bedrock mortars below the dams indicates that there probably were other cultural features in the area.</page><page sequence="76">THE KIVA, Vol. 48, No. 3, Spring 1983 Chapter 4 PETROGLYPHS INTRODUCTION In 1950, Haury reported that "rock-cut pictures are to be found every- where" in the Arizona Papagueria and neighboring areas (1950:472). Although 30 years have passed since this observation was made, only one general description of petroglyphs from the Hohokam area of southern Arizona has been attempted (Schaafsma 1980) and detailed treatment of specific sites and areas is limited to only a few studies in the Gila-Salt area (for example, Snyder 1966, 1975, and 1978; Kearns 1975; Weaver and Rosenberg 1977) and fewer still in the Tucson Basin and vicinity (White 1965; Ferg 1979). Archaeologists have tended to avoid detailed analyses of rock art sites in the past for a variety of reasons, not the least of which are the difficulties involved in their recording and interpretation. Most have opted for temporally controlled ceramic design element analysis as a means of detecting stylistic variation through time and space. The large number of rock art sites in southern Arizona indicates by their very presence that a significant aspect of the culture history is being overlooked. Contrary to what one might suspect, many of the design elements and combinations of design elements are not present on Hohokam ceramics. Thus, without an examination of the elements from both media, there is a definite gap in our knowledge of the creative expression of the Hohokam artist. It is hoped that this report can begin to fill in some of the these gaps and illustrate the archaeological potential of petroglyph studies in the Tucson area. The following analysis of the Los Morteros petroglyphs is presented to provide not only a comprehensive body of data for a single site, but also to build a data base, which, together with the information now available for the Tumamoc Hill petroglyphs, can be compared with other sites in the Tucson area. Preliminary comparisons are offered as the first step in developing a comprehensive study of regional style, variability, and ultimately interpretation or explanation. 201</page><page sequence="77">202 WALLACE METHODS The petroglyphs at Los Morteros were recorded using the format outlined by Ferg (1979:95-96). They were numbered as discussed in Chapter 1. Each face on a petroglyph boulder was treated as a unit (panel). Particularly large faces were split into several arbitrary panels for ease in recording and photographing. The following data were recorded for each panel. 1. The angle of face from the horizontal surface (with 0 degrees equalling the horizontal surface and 90 degrees equalling the vertical surface) 2. The direction the glyph faces 3. The facing direction of the slope upon which the petroglyph boulder is situated (for Rillito Peak) 4. The "intrasite elevation" for each petroglyph boulder [This was recorded as follows: bottom (on the level land at the base of Rillito Peak), low (lower third of Rillito Peak), middle (middle third of Rillito Peak), and high (the upper third of Rillito Peak).] 5. The "intracluster elevation" for each boulder [When applicable, each glyph boulder within a cluster was assigned an "intracluster elevation," that is, the bottom, middle, or top third of the cluster (modified somewhat from Ferg 1979:96).] 6. Freehand drawings to scale for all discernible glyphs 7. Black-and-white photographs using Kodak Plus-X of 82 percent and color slides using Kodak Kodachr me 64 of 91 percent of the petroglyph panels. [Those not photographed were repetitious or particularly easy to draw. Each photograph includes a scale and is labeled as to compass orientation. Size measurements of individual glyphs were not taken beyond the precision of the sketches and photographs, and due to the findings of Ferg (1979: 96), size was not considered to be a critical variable in the subsequent analyses.] It was necessary to photograph the majority of the glyphs in early morning or late afternoon to avoid the high contrast of direct sunlight. In a number of cases, it was found that an electronic flash was the only expedient means of providing suitable lighting. In general, an angle of illumination of about 80 degrees from the face of the glyph produced the best results. Although both 35 mm and 120 mm format cameras were used, 35 mm proved most suited to the rugged terrain and provided completely adequate results.</page><page sequence="78">Rillito Peak 203 Sketches and photographs were the only means used to reproduce the glyphs and are viewed as complementary methods of recording. Any artificial modification of the glyphs by chalking or the use of aluminum powder is seen as adding an additional bias to already difficult-to-interpret data. Some petroglyphs consisted of elements partially obliterated through weathering or lichens, and many were never pecked into any sort of a definable element or design. Elements too faint or broken-up to discern were excluded from the analysis. Vandalism and construction activities have influenced the analysis of the Los Morteros glyphs (Wallace 1980:38-41). Most severely impacted have been the PA and PE clusters at the base of Rillito Peak where many boulders have been removed and damaged by rockfall. As was discussed earlier, an unknown number of boulders with glyphs were destroyed during the construction of the ADOT haul road. It seems likely that many small, portable boulders with glyphs have been removed, judging from their occurrence at less disturbed sites in the Tucson Basin, and it is known that at least two large boulders with glyphs have been taken in recent years. The PG cluster on the floodplain to the south has been most seriously impacted by vandalism, although it and the vast majority of other glyphs have not been subjected to the ubiquitous spray paint and carved initials as have so many other sites. (Between the time this paper was written and the time of publication, this situation has, unfortunately, changed.) It became clear at the onset of this research that if the analysis of the Los Morteros petroglyphs was to have meaning in a regional context, it would be necessary to use comparative data from other Hohokam rock art sites. The large body of data generated by Ferg's (1979) study of the petroglyphs of Tumamoc Hill proved invaluable. His unpublished field data, on file at the Arizona State Museum, were extremely useful for expanding the design element categories he established and for assuring uniformity. The data he gathered for Martinez Hill (AZ BB: 13:2) and Black Mountain (AZ AA: 16:12) were also useful. They were not, however, included in the design element analysis for this report as Ferg ( 1979:109) did not believe they were representative of the sites. It was not possible to use most of the design element data gathered by White (1965) for sites in Saguaro National Monument due to differences in recording technique. The description of her methods (White 1965:1-5) was not sufficiently explicit to enable the author to convert her categories into those of this analysis. Three of the sites White described (AZ AA: 12:64, AZ AA: 12:66, and AZ BB: 14:27) were rerecorded by the author for this study. The author visited 26 sites in the Tucson Basin and vicinity gathering comparative ecological, cultural, and design element information (Table 9). Design elements were recorded at 1 1 sites. It was not possible to record each of these sites in the detail that was employed at Los Morteros. Analysis of the</page><page sequence="79">204 WALLACE Table 9.

Therefore, given time and funding limitations, the comparative sites were recorded by means of field sketches and mapped by cluster location in relation to other cultural features for each site. Individual panels were not recorded as a unit in most cases, although photographs were taken of many of them.</page><page sequence="80">Rillito Peak 205 The comparative data presented in this report are not intended to represent Hohokam rock art in general nor can they be considered a representative sample. They can be considered representative of the total number of sites presently known in the Tucson area for general information on associated features of the natural and cultural environment. Design element analysis on a regional scale must await a considerable quantity of new data. STYLES AND CULTURAL AFFLIATION The petroglyphs at all sites reported here, with one exception (AZ BB:9:97), fall within the Gila Petroglyph style of Schaafsma (1980:83). Characteristically, they consist of both abstract and representational designs that are primarily pecked through direct percussion. Considerable variability occurs at both the inter- and intrasite levels in technical quality, ranging from crudely pecked, ill-defined line drawings to carefully executed ground designs that extend around several faces of a boulder. Ferg (1979:97-98) defines two styles of Hohokam petroglyphs in the Tucson Basin: Pecked and Scratched. Both styles are represented at Los Morteros, although only two definite examples of the scratched type were located (both on the same bedrock outcrop and both occurring in conjunction with anthropomorphs). Scratched style petroglyphs are presently known from only three sites in the Tucson Basin: Tumamoc Hill (AZ AA: 16:6), Martinez Hill (AZ AA: 13:2), and Los Morteros. Although most of the Los Morteros glyphs appear to have been primarily pecked, many were also ground, a pattern repeated at the other sites examined. A tool possibly used for pecking, found in the PA cluster, is illustrated in Figure 16d. The majority of petroglyphs at Los Morteros are attributed to the Hohokam. This is based on the extensive nearby habitation zones, the types of design elements encountered, and the associated Hohokam ceramics. A similar argument can be made for the cultural affiliation of petroglyph sites. For the sites having neither associated diagnostic pottery nor associated villages, cultural affiliation can only be inferred from the design elements present. Only one isolated panel on a large boulder in Romero Canyon can be considered outside of the range of normal Hohokam-associated glyphs. It was recently redrawn and recorded as recommended by L. Huckell (1980:36) and is presented in Figure 25. Its extremely abstract style and basic reliance on curvilinear expression are more similar to the Patayan style defined by Snyder (1978) from the Hedgepeth Hills Site northwest of Phoenix. DATING Dating of the petroglyphs in southern Arizona has been accomplished in the past through three methods: (1) Stylistic comparison of petroglyph design</page><page sequence="81">206 WALLACE POSSIBLE CUPULES \ce Figure 25. Petroglyphs and possible cupules on boulder at AZ BB:9:97. elements with those occurring on Hohokam ceramics having known temporal association; (2) the association of diagnostic pottery with the petroglyph locality: and (3) the inferred association of the petroglyph locality with nearby datable settlements. These dating techniques are supplemented by several relative dating mechanisms such as the degree of patination and superimposition of elements exhibiting differences in patination. A comparison of petroglyph design elements with those on Hohokam ceramics is hindered by the absence of any system for the measurement of changes in the frequencies of elements through time and the lack of a compre- hensive, multisite analysis of the design elements on Hohokam ceramics. The reports of Gladwin and others (1937) and Haury (1976) on Snaketown, and Kelly (1978) on the Hodges Site, together provide a corpus of material from which information on the variation in design elements can be drawn; however, they may not be a good indication of the range in variation for particular design elements at a regional level. Undoubtedly, the most serious problem in comparing petroglyph and ceramic designs is the fact that the basic range of design elements on the ceramics from Snaketown and Hodges and on the petroglyphs recorded in this study overlap to some extent, but differ markedly overall. The most distinctive</page><page sequence="82">Rillito Peak 207 and immediately apparent difference lies in the tendency of the petroglyphs to deviate from discrete, repetitive elements organized into a definable pattern or layout as seen on Hohokam ceramics. It is relatively rare in the petroglyphs to find repeated elements that form some sort of planned geometrical design. Also, a much greater freedom in design is evident than that found on ceramics. This is readily apparent even among the design elements shared by both mediums of expression. A good example of this is the cross-hatch, a design common to both Tanque Verde phase ceramics and petroglyphs in the Tucson area. On pottery, this design is frequently incorporated into the triangular zone of the pendant on Tanque Verde Red-on-Brown (Kelly 1978:54), occurring only in symmetrical, planned arrangements in this context. In contrast, the cross-hatch petroglyphs that most closely resemble the ceramic design grade by varying degrees into the reticulate category, one of the most variable designs recorded. Even the spiral or scroll, one of the most symmetrically oriented elements on Hohokam pottery is depicted in petroglyph form with variations and combinations not seen in Hohokam ceramics. For example, both rectilinear and curvilinear styles may be combined in a single design. Seemingly extraneous lines and pecks are not uncommon, perhaps indicating practice attempts or unfinished designs. This diversity may be the single most important clue to petroglyph meaning and significance. Very few petroglyph motifs can be definitively assigned to one period or phase. A few apparent Sedentary period glyphs are recorded by Ferg (1979:107) on Tumamoc Hill, although the greatest number of readily assignable elements at Tumamoc Hill, Martinez Hill, and Los Morteros are Classic period rectilinear elements (Ferg 1979:98, upper left). On the basis of these elements and relative degrees of patination, the stylistic evidence supports a Classic period designation for most of the elements at Los Morteros, Tumamoc Hill, Martinez Hill, and Black Mountain. Ceramics are completely lacking from many of the sites. Systematic collections will be required, when possible, to establish probable temporal classification. At the present time, the clearest association of petroglyph localities with single component occupation or utilization comes from Rillito Peak, Martinez Hill, Black Mountain, and Tumamoc Hill. All of these sites, with the possible exception of Tumamoc Hill, date mainly to the Classic period. The ceramic data from Rillito Peak indicate intensive use of the petroglyph localities during the Tanque Verde phase. In addition, the lack of superposition and, with only a few exceptions, differences in patination, support a single component interpretation and make Rillito Peak the most firmly dated of the sites mentioned above. With two exceptions, no Tanque Verde phase ceramics have been reported that depict life forms (in contrast to approximately 25 percent of Tucson area petroglyphs recorded here). The exceptions are interesting, as they appear</page><page sequence="83">208 WALLACE similar to some of the petroglyph elements found at Los Morteros and other sites in the Tucson area. The sherd from the Chicken Ranch Site, (AZ AA: 12: 118) (Figure 26a) appears to depict a stickman with an expanded midbody and phalanges. Some form of head elaboration may be present but the sherd is, unfortunately, broken at this point. This particular ceramic depiction of an anthropomorph is very different from those reported by Haury (1976:237-241) on Sedentary period ceramics at Snaketown. Snaketown Sedentary period anthropomorphs are usually depicted in chains or bands; they are usually shown in profile and are frequently involved in some activity. This is a sharp contrast to the life forms recorded in this study; these bear a closer resemblance to the Tanque Verde Red-on-brown sherd from AZ AA: 12:118. The other Tanque Verde phase sherd depicting a life form comes from the Tanque Verde Ruin (AZ BB:14:1) (Figure 26b) and illustrates a quadruped with an expanded midbody. Although quadrupeds do occur on Sedentary period ceramics in the Tucson area and at Snaketown (Haury 1976:24 1), the particular style represented on the sherd from AZ BB: 14: 1 has not been reported except in petroglyph form. It should be noted that life forms on ceramics in the Tucson Basin, even during the Sedentary period, are rare. A B Figure 26. Tanque Verde Red-on-brown sherds illustrating life forms.</page><page sequence="84">Rillito Peak 209 While it could be argued that the stylized, static Hohokam petroglyph anthropomorphs are a result of the medium of expression rather than stylistic convention, a comparison of the overall element inventories in ceramics and petroglyphs demonstrates that complexity in execution is a characteristic of both mediums of expression. DESIGN ELEMENT ANALYSIS Recording rock art in the field is not the straightforward proposition it might appear to be. Meighan (1978:3) may as well have been discussing petroglyphs in southern Arizona when he made the following statement about rock art sites in Baja California: The sites include a large number of apparently random scratchings, unfinished elements, and confusing markings which merge into naturally-produced discolorations and other markings not made by man. This requires numerous judgments on the part of the recorder, and no doubt some errors get into the record because of failure to recognize all of the man-made marks. Additional variables influencing the accurate depiction of the art include lighting and the experience of the observer. It has already been noted that lighting plays a key role in the visibility of petroglyphs. The experience of the observer is particularly critical if an element is faint or partially obliterated. While an inexperienced observer might miss the fingers and toes on a faint stick figure, an experienced recorder would know to look carefully for their presence. Photographs frequently provide a ready check on the biases introduced from these problems. With only a few exceptions, all petroglyphs recorded during the course of this study were drawn by the author and James Holmlund. One other factor that may affect analysis is that at sites with a large number of glyphs and where superposition occurs, many of the older glyphs may be weathered off completely or obliterated by later glyphs. Sites in the Tucson Basin where this occurs include AZ AA: 16:6, AZ AA: 12:62, AZ AA: 12:63, AZ AA: 15:3, AZ BB:5:36, AZ BB: 13:135, AZ BB: 13:2, AZ BB: 14:21, and AZ BB: 14:27. Methods The rationale behind careful design element analysis is perhaps best stated by Heizer and Baumhoff (1962:72): Designs which obviously represent something in the rzal world are not difficult to deal with, but nonrepresentational designs resist categorization. For nonrepresentative designs, therefore, we resort largely to intuition - we simply group those which seem to us to be similar . . . (We) cannot tell a priori which distinctions will be culturally meaningful; if we could we would not have to go through this phase of the analysis. The technique of design element analysis developed for Los Morteros and the other petroglyph sites examined in this study has been derived largely from</page><page sequence="85">210 WALLACE the efforts of Ferg ( 1979:100-103). This technique is designed to incorporate the benefits of both a "splitting" and "lumping" approach to classification by examining the elements at multiple levels of specificity. Each level of analysis comprises a set that is composed of a group of design element categories. Any of these sets can stand alone as a self-contained analysis of all design elements. The specific sets utilized in this analysis are presented in Table 10. There are five sets, each more generalized than the next. The categories of Set 1 are grouped together into the more generalized, inclusive categories of Set 2, and so forth. Thus, Set I represents the "splitting" end of the scale and Set 5 is the "lumping" end. Groups of categories that are separated in Set I are lumped together in Set 2 and so on. The design element categories and category sets used by Ferg (1979) have been modified to facilitate the introduction of the data presented in this report. Anthropomorphs have been excluded from Sets I and 2 and are treated separately in greater detail. Five new categories of zoomorphs have been added to Set 1. Examples are illustrated in Figure 27. Two additional categories added to Set I are parallel lines and parallel scratches. A "not-assignable" category, added for this analysis, includes problematic elements that could fit equally well into either representational or abstract Miscellaneous zoomorphs AZ AA:12:57 Quadruped, 2 legs, facing right AZ AA:12:66 AZ BB:14:27 Quadruped, 2 legs, facing left+ew AZ AA:12:64 AZ BB:5:36 AZ AA:12:64 Quadruped, 3 cr 4 legs, facing right AZ BB:14:27 AZ BB:14:27 Coiled snake AZ BB: 14:27 AZ AA:12:57 AZ AA:12:57 Figure 27.

They are listed for each category set for the sites recorded in the interests of providing as complete a picture as possible. Had they been interpreted, they might easily have biased the results towards a higher percentage of abstract elements. Sets 3 and 4 have been altered somewhat from Ferg's system (1979:102- 103) and Set 5 has been added to facilitate interregional comparisons in the Southwest. Definitions of specific design elements used in this report may be found in Ferg (1979) and Heizer and Baumhoff (1962). Most are self-evident. Perhaps least apparent are the reticulates defined by Ferg (1979:100). Typical examples from Los Morteros are illustrated below (Figure 28). Results The final tabulations of petroglyph design elements for Los Morteros and the other sites examined for comparative data are presented in Tables 10 and 11. Low sample sizes limit the comparative value of several of these sites, particularly at the very specific levels of Sets I and 2. At the more general levels of Sets 3, 4, and 5, several interesting differences are discernible. At AZ BB: 14:27, AZ AA: 12:64, AZ AA: 12:66, and AZ BB:5:36, the percentages of life forms as opposed to abstract elements is considerably higher than the percentages for Tumamoc Hill and Los Morteros. The high percentages of life forms are particularly striking at AZ BB:5:36 and AZ BB: 14:27. For all sites examined in this study, anthropomorphs occurred more commonly than zoomorphs. Rectilinear abstract element frequencies (Set 3) also vary dramatically from site to site. Roughly similar percentages are found at Los Morteros (AZ AA: 12:57), Tumamoc Hill (AZ AA: 16:6), and at AZ AA: 12:66, while at sites AZ AA: 12:64, AZ BB:5:36, and AZ BB: 14:27 these elements are uncommon or even absent. When viewed in the light of the data from the comparative sites, the similarity in design element frequencies at Los Morteros and Tumamoc Hill is Figure 28.

ANTHROPOMORPH DESIGN ELEMENT ANALYSIS During the fieldwork it was apparent that distinctive stylistic variation within and between sites occurred for certain design elements. Particularly striking were the differences in the treatment of anthropomorphs. Because anthropomorphs are representational rather than abstract and thus have a greater potential for meaningful interpretation, and because they are widely distributed and relatively abunmant elements, a more detailed analysis was attempted for them. It was hoped that some of the rather surprising variability encountered in the general design element analysis could be either substantiated or shown to be less significant. In addition, it was hoped that this might shed some light on the close relationship of Tumamoc Hill and Los Morteros indicated in the overall analysis. Methods The initial design element analysis consists of an examination of seven attributes or variables as defined below. Variable I: Body form. This variable is divided into three possible modes: Stick figures, full body figures, and figures with an expanded midbody. Full body figures are separated from expanded midbody figures by having the body expansion extend to both the head and the juncture of the legs. Expanded</page><page sequence="94">Rillito Peak 219 midbody figures do not have the expansion extending to the head. Examples of each from Los Morteros are illustrated below (Figure 29). Variable 2: Arm position. Four modes are identified for this variable: arms up, arms down, arms out straight, and one arm up, one arm down. Variable 3: Representation of a "phallus." This is recorded only as present or absent. Variable 4: Depiction of hands, feet, or phalanges. This is recorded as present or absent. Presence is recorded when at least one limb depicts hands, feet, or phalanges. Examples from several sites are given below (Figure 30). Variable 5: Angularity. Three expressions are possible: both arms and legs curvilinear, both arms and legs straight-line or angular, and figures that are half angular, half curvilinear. Examples are given below (Figure 3 1). Variables 6 and 7: Anthropomorph elaborations. Variable 6 depicts variability in the head of anthropomorphs. Values are solid, hollow, or absent completely. Variable 7 is a listing of three overlapping categories describing unusual elaborations on the basic anthropomorphic figure. Examples are presented in Figure 32 and in Table 12.

The next level of analysis examines several of the variables taken together. In Table 13, Variables 2 and 3, arms and phallus are combined. Only the categories for which representations have been recorded are included. Proceed- ing one step further, in Table 14, the additional variable of hands, feet, or phalanges is added to Variables 2 and 3. Analysis is not broken down any further than this due to the diminishing values obtained if the analysis becomes too detailed. Tabulations are presented for each of the sites with anthropomorphs. A word of explanation on the nature of the data is probably in order here. The sample size of many of the variables for particular sites is smaller than the total sample size of anthropomorphs at that site. This is because some of the anthropomorphs are missing diagnostic characteristics due to weathering or vandalism and, thus, could not be used for some of the analyses. Depictions of lizards, both of the horned lizard form and a more slender variety, are recognizable elements in Hohokam rock art and ceramic design. Unfortunately, for the less realistic depictions, there comes a fine line of distinction between a phallic stickman and a thin-tailed lizard. For the analysis presented in this report, an arbitrary distinction was drawn at the point where the phallus-tail extends beyond the limits of the legs. If shorter, the glyph is classified as an anthropomorph, if longer, it is treated as a lizard and excluded from the detailed analysis of anthropomorphs. Results The analysis of anthropomorphs depicted at the five sites examined supports the findings of the general design element analysis (Table 12). Styles are highly variable between and within sites and site-specific idiosyncrasies are apparent. Two findings that substantiate the general analysis are the close similarities between Tumamoc Hill and Los Morteros and the dissimilarity of AZ AA: 12:66 from the other sites. In general, anthropomorphs at the sites under consideration are most often represented as stickmen without any elaboration of the body or head and without phallus, hands, feet, or phalanges.</page><page sequence="96">Rillito Peak 221 cmm qsq .o_ 00 ii cm cV 00 ow w Figure 32.

Most figures are static and over 99 percent are depicted head-on. White (1965) describes and illustrates a considerable amount of variation in the anthropomorphs she recorded; however, it is impossible to determine from her account what percentage of the figures had been developed beyond the basic stickman. Design element analysis and. survey by the author has confirmed the range of variability White describes though it should be pointed out that the percentage of elaborate figures is extremely low. Most of the variability identified can be accounted for by Variables 1 through 6. Less than five percent of the anthropomorphs recorded are in some way elaborated. The most common form of elaboration is an addition to the head in the form of possible jewelry, hair, or masks. Several particular types of elaboration have been recorded at more than one site (Figure 32, upper row, four center glyphs). Considerable variation in the depiction of the body has been observed. There seems to be a definite style of stickman with an expanded midbody (Figure 29, center), and many variations on a full body theme have been recorded. Additions to the body in the form of extra lines and loops that may represent clothing or ritual paraphernalia also occur. Other items of interest include the apparent depiction of items of material culture (Figure 32, bottom row). Possible canes, a bow or shield, and balls were recorded. The depiction of motion or panels with actual scenes of some sort are extremely rare. Chains of figures holding hands were recorded on Tumamoc Hill and Martinez Hill and others have been reported at Picture Rocks (AZ AA: 12:62) (Schaafsma 1980:95). None was found at Los Morteros. Hunting scenes have been reported at several Tucson Basin sites, but were not en- countered in this study. SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF DESIGN ELEMENTS If ever specific petroglyph design element categories are to provide us with some clue as to specific symbolism, it is most likely to be found at this level of analysis. At the present time, only the data provided by Ferg (1979) on Tumamoc Hill and the results of this research on Los Morteros are available for discussion, although some observations can be made on other sites. A comparison of design element categories for the variables of cluster and elevation reveals several apparently non-random distributions at Los Morteros. Twice as many anthropomorphs (12) occur in the PN cluster high on Rillito Peak as should be expected by their frequency elsewhere on the site. A high frequency of mountain-top anthropomorphs was also encountered on Tumamoc Hill (Ferg 1979:109). Twice as many circle and circle and line motifs occur on</page><page sequence="102">Rillito Peak 227 the middle and upper slopes of Rillito Peak as should be expected by their frequency elsewhere on the site. Other possibly significant distributional anomalies are groups of identical or very similarly executed design elements on single or adjacent panels. This has been noted at a number of sites. At Los Morteros, four huge sun disks exhibiting different levels of patination are present on a single panel (PN-8) that faces due east and is readily visible only in the light of the rising sun. Sun disks in general have a higher than expected frequency facing east (86 percent by element) at Los Morteros, although this pattern is not repeated at other sites. On the north end of Rillito Peak there are two separate groups of petroglyph elements approximately 30 m apart that bear a striking stylistic resemblance to each other (both include a unique style of elaborated diamonds). They are illustrated in Figure 33. PO-1 is located about halfway between the bottom of the slope and PO-2 and PO-3. PO-2 and PO-3 are located near a sheltered recess in the mountain cliffs that may once have had a seep spring nearby (there is calcareous deposition along a fault line and relatively dense vegetation). Only PO-1 can be readily seen from the base of the mountain. Although specific meaning cannot be assigned to these glyphs, some kind of symbolism seems to be indicated. Depictions of numbers of circles and circle patterns on single panels have been observed at two sites: AZ AA: 15:3 and AZ AA: 12:65. At AZ AA: 15:3, a single panel depicts at least 21 circles and a circle pattern. Two levels of patination indicate that some of the circles were repecked after the original design had become somewhat patinated. At AZ AA: 12:65, a large panel in a wash depicts at least 27 single circles or chains of circles and one curvilinear reticulate. On this panel, three levels of patination are visible with super- imposition indicating a temporal difference between episodes of pecking. These two examples suggest temporal continuity in petroglyph styles at these locations, though the length of time cannot be ascertained. Other examples of multiple elements on single panels that are similar in design or style can be cited for many sites. These cases are offered merely as illustrations of the pattern. In some cases, such as with some of the anthropomorphs at AZ BB: 14:27, a particular style is repeated in a single panel, PO-2,3 PO-1 Figure 33. Petroglyph design elements in the PO cluster.</page><page sequence="103">228 WALLACE not to be found anywhere else at the site. These may have been pecked by the same individual. It was hoped at the onset of this study that it would be possible to link a specific element or group of elements with some feature of the cultural or natural environment. So far, this has not been possible. Such a correlation, if present, may only become apparent upon completing in-depth analyses of many more sites than the author was able to examine. AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD: THE ANALYSIS OF VARIABILITY When developing the research design for this study it was believed that petroglyphs would fit fairly readily into a standardized system of design element analysis. The degree of variability encountered at Los Morteros was surprising, and it seemed there might be some better method beyond the standard design element analysis lists that are becoming the trademark of current rock art reports. The following method was designed as an attempt to analyze variability. In ceramic design and other fields of stylistic analysis it is generally believed that there is a higher probability for repeated identical designs if the potters are of the same culture, the same local group or village, or socially tied in some way such that there are frequent social contacts. Given this assumption, and armed with good evidence that the glyphs discussed here are the product of a single cultural group, then, at any given site, the variability in design elements could be explained by any of the following hypotheses. 1. Temporal span represented. A multiphase site should have greater variability than a single phase site. Different levels of patination should be discernible for a longterm site and superimposition may occur. 2. Social grouping. A greater degree of variability should occur if different villages or tribal groups are involved than if individual social groups within a site or individuals within a site are responsible. This could suggest that glyph sites located on trade routes, hunting routes, or at springs or wild plant gathering or processing localities that were frequented by many different tribal groups, should contain a higher degree of variability than glyphs at habitation sites or base camps occupied by a single group. If great variation was found at wild resource procurement or processing localities that were seasonally ex- ploited, it could mean that different social or tribal groups were gathering at the same locality. This relies on the assumption that for any given cultural or social group, the numbers of individuals at a particular locality making petroglyphs would remain relatively constant, depending on the size of the groups or number of individuals involved so that greater variation at a particular site would not be due simply to more people at that site.</page><page sequence="104">Rillito Peak 229 3. Number ofpurposes orfunctions. If it can be assumed that a petroglyph is produced with some intention or purpose in mind, and that the purpose or intention is related in some way to the activities going on at a site or to the site's functions, then petroglyphs at sites with many different activities will be more variable than petroglyphs at sites with few activities. Specifically, it is hypothesized that large habitation related sites, at which many activities occurred, will have diverse petroglyphs present, whereas small, single activity sites will have not only fewer glyphs, but also a lower degree of variability among them. This assumption relies in part on the second hypothesis listed above. If each glyph were produced independently with no meaning intelligible to others, and there were no cultural or social factors involved, then each site should have maximal variability. The fact that design elements are repeated both within sites and at different sites suggests that this is not the case. For any given archaeological example, all three of the above hypotheses or any combination thereof may be involved. Identifying which hypothesis applies in any given case will require observation of the design elements involved, relative degrees of patination and superimposition, and spatial distribution. In addition, the regional framework of the site must be considered in order to be sure that a particular locality is, for example, not associated with habitation, but is located in a wild resource exploitation area. It is not the author's intent here to examine the above hypotheses in depth. The number of sites and elements thus far recorded is too low to attempt such a detailed investigation. A method for examining various sites in regard to their individual diversity is illustrated in Figure 34 as an example of how the technique might be approached. The author is of the opinion that this method may tell us more about individual sites or localities than can be achieved through conventional design element analyses. With a few more cases that have fairly large numbers of elements, it will be possible to test these ideas. If the technique can be perfected, it may be possible to show whether the petroglyphs on Rillito Peak were most likely produced by a resident Los Morteros population or if people from many sites gathered at the Rillito Peak wild plant processing areas during the mesquite harvest(s) (see Chapter 2), marking their stay with a glyph or two. SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION An in-depth analysis of the spatial distribution of petroglyphs on a com- parative intra- and intersite basis must await additional study of the sort now accomplished for Tumamoc Hill and Los Morteros. To facilitate such future analysis, a detailed description of Los Morteros is offered, followed by a small portion of the comparative data.</page><page sequence="105">230 WALLACE .. 100 * AA,I 6 W I* AA:12:57 o 8o 0 0 * BB:14:27 I- S40 :5,3 0 * AA:12'64 0o o 50 IseO e 2 3o 0 NUMBER OF DESIGN ELEMENTS Figure 34. Method for comparing petroglyph design element variability among six Tucson area sites. The petroglyphs of Los Morteros extend for over two kilometers across the site with a small cluster (seven percent) occurring in the southern habitation area (PG) and the remaining 93 percent spread along Rillito Peak. Figure 35 provides a general summary of their distribution by cluster in relation to major physiographic features and bedrock mortars on Rillito Peak, and Figure 36 provides a more detailed summary of the PG cluster. Ninety-seven boulders with a total of over 266 design elements were recorded on Rillito Peak, and over 19 design elements were recorded in the PG cluster. Two boulders with only recent historic initials and dates were also located on Rillito Peak. Suitable rock surfaces for petroglyphs are distributed throughout the mountainous portion of Los Morteros although specific scattered outcrops have the best flat surfaces. These have been used in some cases; however, in general, the distribution of petroglyphs does not coincide with the best outcrops. Seventy-two percent of the glyphs on Rillito Peak are located in two large clusters. PA, the largest, with 56 percent of the glyphs, is located on a large bedrock ridge that contacts the Santa Cruz River at Point of Mountain. This cluster contains glyphs pecked onto all grades and qualities of andesite, indicating a preference for this particular geographical location rather than for a particular quality of stone. PN, the other large cluster (containing 16 percent of the Rillito Peak elements) is located on a bedrock knob overlooking a saddle on the mountain above the PA cluster. All petroglyphs recorded are located on the eastern and northern slopes of Rillito Peak with the exception of the PG cluster in the floodplain to the south.</page><page sequence="106">Rillito Peak 231 0 0x o iti 5 o io l edortar l t o C Pbtro glyph cluster 50 2 0 70 x Isolated mortar boulder x Isolated petroglyph boulder Figure 35. Relationship of petroglyph and mortar distributions on Rillito Peak. Seventy-nine percent of the glyphs are located along the lower 40 m of the slopes on Rillito Peak. A preference was noted for placing glyphs on the more vertical rock faces (70 percent are oriented 46 to 90 degrees) and most face downslope. All but one of the glyphs recorded for the site are located on patinated boulders of andesite; the exception is an unpatinated surface in Rock Shelter 4. Given the above distribution at Los Morteros, it is evident that petroglyphs are not randomly distributed across the site. It can be seen from the information presented on the natural environment of the area that the concentration of petroglyphs along the eastern slope of Rillito Peak could be related to the Santa Cruz River, the mesquite bosque, or potentially arable land on the floodplain. Given these factors the question of association becomes a search to determine whether small-scale patterning is present. If so, are there cultural features that could explain the patterning? At a gross level, it can be seen that petroglyphs co-occur with habitation zones at the base of Rillito Peak, with bedrock mortars, large rock shelters, and possibly with a lithic quarry. There is a definite lack of any association with the trincheras features. It is perhaps more instructive to examine the distribution on a finer scale because large clusters may be associated with a range of cultural features that</page><page sequence="107">232 ,WALLACE SPG-4 M-I MK- 13b MK-I O Boulders with mortar(s) MK-12 .

Mortar, cupule, and petroglyph distribution in the MK/PG cluster. clouds possible relationships. Therefore, the scattered small groups of glyphs that occur across the eastern slope of Rillito Peak are examined below. Eight boulders or clusters of boulders with glyphs fit into this category. In only one case (PS-8) is a glyph apparently completely isolated from any immediately adjacent cultural feature. A small group of glyphs is located on and adjacent to a boulder with mortars and metates at the entrance to a small rock shelter (Rock Shelter 1) that shows evidence of habitation. In each of six other cases small clusters of glyphs are located among or adjacent to groups of bedrock mortars (PS-4, PD, PS-7, PE, PF, and PS-5). In five of these clusters of glyphs there are mortars either on or adjacent to the same boulder as the petroglyphs. These data are not presented to indicate that petroglyphs are consistently associated with mortars on an intrasite basis, as the largest concentrations of mortars on Rillito Peak do not correspond to the largest concentrations of glyphs. Rather, petroglyphs, when present, appear to be related to wild plant processing stations. The PN cluster, located on a high, east-facing bedrock knob overlooking the saddle that divides Rillito Peak, may be associated with a variety of cultural features. Across the saddle facing it is Rock Shelter 3. In the flat area of the</page><page sequence="108">Rillito Peak 233 saddle between the rock shelter and PN is a series of at least six small trincheras (Cluster TJ). The petroglyphs may also be associated with Feature 1, a large jasper quarrying and processing area that extends down the western slope from the saddle. Other isolated petroglyphs on Rillito Peak on the north and northeast slopes cannot presently be fully evaluated due to the impacts of the ADOT emergency access road and Avra Valley Road. The Los Morteros data indicate that correlations of petroglyphs cannot be limited to a single aspect of the cultural or natural landscape. The strongest correlation that can presently be argued from the Los Morteros data suggest two prerequisites for the placement of glyphs: available rock, and presence of an activity area associated with the processing or gathering of wild plant, animal, or lithic resources. Given the correlation with activity areas, it is perhaps most informative at Los Morteros to look where petroglyphs could be but are not to determine if this correlation is valid. Petroglyphs could have been made anywhere along the mountainous portion of Los Morteros. However, their distribution in the mountains is limited to Rillito Peak. None have been located south of Puerto del Azotado in the mountainous portion of Los Morteros (although not all of this area has been intensively surveyed). On Rillito Peak, they are not present on the sparsely used western slopes, and they are absent from most of the upper slopes and summit where the trincheras are located. Not unexpectedly then, it can be said that when other indications of cultural activity are lacking, so too are petroglyphs. Surprisingly, some of the most intensive activity areas on the mountains of Los Morteros (the two main groups of trincheras) do not have associated petroglyphs. This may indicate that the activities centered on the trincheras are different from those associated with the majority of petroglyphs. Mortars occurring with the trincheras on Rillito Peak are generally small and do not seem to represent intensive resource exploitation, while at Rattlesnake Pass bedrock mortars and metates that might indicate the utilization of wild plants are almost completely absent. The mortars and metates in these areas are probably only peripherally related to the basic subsistence activities of the people who made them. Therefore, with the exception of Trincheras Cluster TJ discussed above, none of the trincheras can reasonably be inferred to be activity areas focused on the procurement or processing of some form of mountain resource. Thus, the negative correlation between petroglyphs and trincheras at Los Morteros does support the basic premise that petroglyphs are associated with activity areas that are used for the exploitation of wild resources. Another possible cultural association that has not yet been examined is the possible relationship of petroglyphs to major trails. As trail markers they would be likely to occur at the place where a trail passes suitable rock, or a place</page><page sequence="109">234 WALLACE where people would likely stop on an aboriginal trail. Although both of these conditions would apply to the PA cluster, and the PN cluster could be marking a major trail across the northern end of Rillito Peak, this possibility does not take into account the glyphs found scattered along the lower slopes of Rillito Peak. HOHOKAM ROCK ART SITES AND THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL ASSOCIATIONS In previous studies Hohokam petroglyphs sites have been correlated with six different aspects of the cultural and natural environment: (1) wild floral and faunal resources, (2) irrigated and potentially arable land, (3) water resources, (4) activity areas, (5) suitable rock, and (6) trail systems (Table 15). Factor 5, suitable rock, may be taken as a prerequisite for all petroglyphs. As a factor it becomes significant when suitable surfaces are scarce, thereby setting limitations on potential location. It must be considered in the Tucson area. Trail systems are considered as special cases by Weaver and Rosenberg (1978), and they do not mean to suggest that this is a factor in the location of all or even most sites. A detailed examination of the studies listed above reveals more uniformity than is immediately apparent from their conclusions. Snyder's study (1966: 1975) attributes the South Mountain localities to Hohokam farmers involved in intensive irrigation agriculture that once extended to the base of the-mountains. He does not offer any suggestion as to why so many of the localities are located high in the mountains or why the Hohokam ventured into the mountains in the first place. Snyder considers hunting as a possible stimulus for the petroglyphs, but rejects the hypothesis due to the limited distribution of glyphs, the assumed Table 15.

The number of localities would be much greater.</page><page sequence="110">Rillito Peak 235 agricultural reliance of the Hohokam, and the assumption of low prehistoric game populations. Although it is impossible to determine what the prehistoric game populations might have been, it is known that the Hohokam made use of both deer and bighorn sheep (Greene and Mathews 1976:371-373), both of which are represented in the South Mountain glyphs (Snyder 1966:705). Snyder (1966:705) reports that no permanent springs, seeps, or streams are present in the mountains, though a brief examination by the author of several canyons where glyphs are located revealed seeps and vegetation consistent with an interpretation of year-round moisture. In addition, Snyder overlooks the fact that, being close to a large prehistoric population known to rely to some extent on wild resources, the South Mountains would certainly have been used for their exploitation. Kearns' study (1975) attempts to apply Snyder's results to the Orme Reservoir Area. It is clear from the environmental data in his report that the sites could be associated with not only water resources and zones of potentially arable land, but also with wild plant and animal resources. Ferg's suggestion (1979:112) that activity areas influenced the location of petroglyphs on three Tucson Basin cerros de trincheras seems overly generalized. He does not attempt to enumerate the specific associations he encountered. Future analysis of the Tumamoc Hill material together with the necessary addition of new data may provide more specific information on particular associations. Taken together the studies discussed above may point to the association of Hohokam petroglyphs with wild resource procurement and processing, a hypothesis supported by the findings from Los Morteros. To test this, an inventory of the Arizona State Museum files for petroglyph-pictograph sites in the greater Tucson area was made. The 26 (of 38 known) sites for which information is presently available are included in Table 9. Each site was field checked or recorded by the author. As a measure of wild resource procurement and processing activities, bedrock mortars and metates are listed as present or absent if they occur within 10 m of the petroglyphs. Any drainages associated with the sites are categorized according to the nature of available water. This serves as a general measure of any associated riparian vegetation as well. A fourth variable considered is the distance to the nearest known site or sites with sufficient depth and variety of cultural material to indicate permanent habitation. Because the four large cerros de trincheras sites in the study area have not been recorded by localities in the manner of the other sites, they have been excluded from the following analysis to avoid skewing the data. If the measures presented here are accepted, then the fact that 8 1 percent of the sites have bedrock mortars or metates indicates that resource procurement and processing activities were taking place in conjunction with the majority of petroglyph sites. As one would expect these activities at habitation sites with or</page><page sequence="111">236 WALLACE without petroglyphs, a better measure is the number of petroglyph sites not situated near habitation that are associated with mortars or metates. Eight of eleven sites fit into this category. The possibility that glyphs are related to habitation activities (59 percent) or potentially arable land (41 percent) is not supported by these data. All but one of the glyph sites is located immediately adjacent to a drainage of some sort. This is interpreted both as a function of the topography and geology of the region, and the associated riparian resources, as most washes with bedrock do not have glyphs. Although it is impossible to know whether water would have been available in the past in any of the drainages that are now intermittent, only six of the 22 sites are known to have had permanent water nearby in historic times. The data presented here are only a small part of the potential information that could be gathered for the sites. As the author has used metates as a measure of resource processing, it should be noted that an alternative hypothesis for the function of these items at petroglyph sites has been suggested by Schaafsma (1980:96). She speculated that they may have been used for grinding paint for ritual painting of the glyphs, basing this on the historic references to the Painted Rock site. No evidence for this practice has been documented, however, even in sheltered localities where paint should have been preserved. In the previous discussion a single cause has been suggested to explain petroglyph localities. Several factors suggest that this may be overly simplistic. For example, Weaver and Rosenberg (1978) and Schaafsma (1980: 98) discuss several localities that seem to be indisputable "trail markers." Both on Martinez Hill and Tumamoc Hill the author has observed petroglyphs along what appear to be prehistoric trails, and AZ AA: 12:63, AZ AA: 12:80, and AZ AA: 12:81 could each be interpreted as having some trail marking function. DISCUSSION Although the types and extent of the data presently available on Hohokam rock art in the greater Tucson area Pre limited, enough is now available to begin to derive useful interpretations of the petrogly ph localities examined in this study. In the following discussion six interpretations of rock art are examined. 1. Doodling or graffiti. This hypothesis would expect a nonrandom distribution, concentrated in areas at or near places where the Hohokam spent a fair amount of time. Petroglyphs should be widely distributed in habitation sites with suitable rock and in rocky areas on mountain slopes that show evidence of intensive use. The lack of petroglyphs on the mountain near the largest set of trincheras at Los Morteros and the existence of sites such as AZ BB: 14:2 that have suitable rock but no petroglyphs tend to refute this hypothesis. Likewise, the concentration of Hohokam petroglyphs at sites such as Painted Rocks (AZ S:16:1) and Signal Hill (AZ AA: 12:63) away from zones of intensive habitation does not fit these test implications.</page><page sequence="112">Rillito Peak 237 2. Mnemonic devices similar to the Piman calendar sticks. Just as Ferg (1979:115) reported for the Tumamoc Hill and South Mountains sites, the author has discovered no apparent syntax in design element groupings. If the element groupings are mnemonic, but idiosyncratic, determining their meaning would be impossible (Ferg 1979:115). 3. Clan or totem symbols. Through the use of ethnographic data, Colton (1946) and Colton and Colton (1931) have demonstrated the use of petroglyphs by the Hopi as clan symbols. They found that individual clan signatures were repeated on one portion of a boulder, generally in rows. In this study groupings of similar elements were also recorded at many sites, although large numbers of similar elements on a single boulder were found only at AZ AA: 15:3 and AZ AA: 12:65. No more than five elements of similar form are known from any one boulder at Los Morteros, and a similar lack of ordered repetition was noted by Ferg (1979:115) on Tumamoc Hill. If the cases of ordered repetition witnessed at sites such as AZ AA: 15:3 do indeed represent clan signatures, it does not seem reasonable to assume that all of the petroglyphs at these localities would serve this function. Lacking detailed information on Hohokam social organiza- tion, the clan symbol hypothesis must at present remain untestable. 4. Decoration. Ferg (1979:116) developed the hypothesis that the petroglyphs on Tumamoc Hill "were created for the enhancement of the petroglyph maker's immediate surroundings." If the author has correctly understood him, Ferg's opinion is that petroglyphs serve different functions at different localities and that for Tumamoc Hill, where glyphs are most commonly associated with secular activity areas, a decorative interpretation would best fit the data. Although Ferg states that this hypothesis is untestable, one possible test implication is that petroglyphs will be located on the sides of boulders facing activity areas. Although this could be tested with the Tumamoc Hill data and some fieldwork, Ferg does not attempt to do so. While the hypothesis may be the correct one for the Tumamoc Hill data, the difficulty in testing it, with the exception of the method noted above, makes it prudent to evaluate other testable hypotheses as well. 5. Trail markers or signaling devices. Examples within and between sites of petroglyphs associated with trails have been identified, although in most cases multiple hypotheses could account for the presence of the glyphs. It is possible that a specific class of sites functions in this manner. Sites such as AZ AA: 12:63 (Signal Hill), AZ AA:15:3, AZ BB:14:21, and AZ S:16:1 may function in this capacity as each of these sites is located some distance from any apparent major habitation and at each site the petroglyphs are situated on a major physiographic landmark such as an isolated rocky hill or the point of a mountain ridge. As noted previously, the PA cluster at Los Morteros could also be categorized in this manner. If these localities are involved in intergroup communication, certain design elements should recur at different sites. If a</page><page sequence="113">238 WALLACE sufficiently refined technique of stylistic analysis could be developed, it might be possible to correlate elements occurring at these localities with those at major sites such as Tumamoc Hill or Los Morteros where habitation or activity- related glyphs are present, thus identifying specific regional interactions. If particular elements served as some form of inter-regional signaling device, these elements may only occur at the most prominent zones in any one area. Thus, a particular element or elements might be common to Los Morteros, Tumamoc Hill, and Martinez Hill, but might not occur at smaller villages or resource processing areas. 6. Ceremonial or religious significance. A ceremonial or religious significance has been assigned to rock art by many archaeologists. In Australia (McCarthy 1958), the Navajo region of the Southwest (Schaafsma 1980), southern California (Grant 1965), and in many other areas, ceremonial significance of rock art has been well documented on the basis of ethnographic data. Lacking such an enviable body of data for the Hohokam, the association becomes much more difficult to substantiate. The fact that the majority of glyphs Ferg (1979:115) recorded were associated with activity areas with no evidence of ceremonialism led him to believe that their significance might be secular. He does not discuss why he believes that they could not serve a ceremonial function and still be related to a secular activity. In previous portions of this report the author has attempted to demonstrate that rock art localities in the Tucson area are intimately tied to areas where wild resources are procured and processed. This includes the gathering and processing of wild floral resources, hunting, and possibly quarrying activities for the procurement of lithic tools. This nonrandom distribution of petroglyphs associated with an important aspect of Hohokam life could easily be interpreted as a result of some sort of religious or ceremonial belief, though other interpretations may be equally valid. Heizer and Baumhoff (1963) and Grant (1968) have convincingly argued that the Great Basin Abstract petroglyphs of Nevada and eastern California are ritually associated with the hunting of large game animals. A similar ritual association may be present for the Tucson area sites if this idea is expanded to include wild resources other than large game animals. It has been demonstrated that the Tucson area sites are consistently associated with the processing or procurement of wild resources. The glyphs at these sites may represent the expression of hope or appreciation to the supernatural for a successful harvest or hunt. However, the large percentages of abstract elements at these sites make the hypothesis difficult to evaluate. Another aspect of Hohokam petroglyphs that should be noted is the repetition of specific, complex design elements at different sites. One such element discussed by Ferg (1979:104, 109) is the pipette. In addition to appearing at the sites listed by Ferg (AZ AA:12:65, AZ AA:16:6, AZ BB:13:2, and a</page><page sequence="114">Rillito Peak 239 South Mountain locality), it was noted by the author at AZ AA: 15:3, Los Morteros, and at an unrecorded site along the San Pedro River northeast of Charleston. The production of these complex elements at such widely scattered sites implies the presence of some sort of consistent symbolic meaning for the design. Regardless of what the Hohokam artisans may have had in mind when they pecked the designs recorded in this study, if these preliminary findings are accurate it has been demonstrated that petroglyphs are consistently associated with one aspect of the Hohokam lifeway, the processing and procurement of wild resources. It has also been suggested that petroglyphs may serve as one vehicle for arriving at interpretations of site population homogeneity and functional diversity through an analysis of the degrees of variability in design depiction and composition at particular sites or localities. These ideas and results, together with the possibility of developing a usable stylistic chronology and a better understanding of the artistic expression of a poorly understood people will, we hope, stimulate future research on Hohokam rock art.</page><page sequence="115">THE KIVA, Vol. 48, No. 3, Spring 1983 Chapter 5 DISCUSSION The significance of Rillito Peak to the Hohokam can best be assessed in terms of the resources that made it attractive to them. The Santa Cruz River, the probable large mesquite bosque, and the large quantity of arable land are all likely reasons for settlement in the floodplain near the mountain. Rillito Peak itself provided resources and shaped the activities of the Hohokam living near to it. At the most basic level the mountain served as a ready source of workable stone. Jasper and andesite, probably originating on Rillito Peak, have been found in habitation zones in the floodplain at Los Morteros and at other sites nearby. Both types of stone were important as raw material fcr the manufacture of stone tools, and the andesite was also a source of building material. It has been demonstrated that the bedrock mortars and cupules are related to the probable presence of a large mesquite bosque, the presence of suitable rock surfaces, and nearby habitation. They tend to illustrate the importance of mesquite in the local, and perhaps regional, subsistence economy. It has been suggested that the presence of the bosque at Los Morteros played an important role in determining the site's regional significance and development. The petroglyphs at Los Morteros underscore the importance of mesquite at the site by having a distribution related to that of the mortars. Though the glyphs are by no means restricted to mesquite procurement or processing areas at Los Morteros and other sites in the Tucson area, they do seem to be directly related to these and other activities associated with the nondomestic resources important to the Hohokam. Excluding the processing of mesquite, undoubtedly the most intensive cultural activities on Rillito Peak were related to the trincheras. At the present time the most reasonable interpretation of their presence on Rillito Peak is habitation and the cultivation of some kind of specialized crop. Trincheras apparently representing dwellings or temporary shelters are dispersed among others that may have been used for cultivation. The choice of a mountain 241</page><page sequence="116">242 WALLACE environment for cultivation may relate to the special temperature and moisture retention properties that have been recorded on Tumamoc Hill (Spalding 1909; Hastings and Turner 1965). The two sets of check dams located on the northeast slope of Rillito Peak were probably also associated with agricultural activity. From the limited ceramic evidence the most intensive use of Rillito Peak and the floodplain area immediately adjacent to it occurred during the Tanque Verde phase. It is possible that the utilization of mesquite and agricultural activity on the trincheras represents a period of intensification for the local economy during this time period. The Rillito Peak survey has provided a view of the extraordinary range of Hohokam activity present at a single site with a varied local environment. It serves to emphasize the importance of the Los Morteros Site in terms of its regional context. Although portions of the archaeological record have been lost forever, what remains in this area may be critically important to our understand- ing of the Tucson Basin Hohokam.</page><page sequence="117">THE KIVA, Vol. 48, No. 3, Spring 1983 REFERENCES Barnett, Franklin 1973 Lonesome Valley Ruin in Yavapai County, Arizona.
