<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SECTARIAN INTRODUCTION TO THE OLD TESTAMENT A PECULIAR view of the "inner harmony" and "underlying unity" of each of the Old Testament books is set forth in this most recent "orthodox Protestant" work.* After a brief sketch of the history of Introductions to the Old Testament, in which nineteenth century mas- ters are described as laboring "in the dark night of criticism" and Pro- fessor Pfeiffer's insistence upon scientific objectivity is decried as "anti- Christian," the author takes the position that the Holy Scriptures, as constituted by the first century canon and referred to in the New Testament, are basically a divine book with God Himself as its author. They are not to be regarded as a series of historical documents, but as one book, perfect (except for a few textual blemishes) and uniformly inspired to the last word and letter (p. 35). Hence their "inner har- mony" and "underlying unity." These are not literary qualities, but theological. Yet it is contended that they show themselves in the books, as such. The author makes no distinction between a doctrinal position regarding what he accepts as the Word of God and a literary view of the Bible. This, of course, is very like what Islam made of the Qoran. Fortu- nately for the purposes of discovering the truth about Mohammed and his book, there have latterly been unbelievers who have studied the Qoran by proper philological, literary and historical methods. And happily for Jewish and Christian learning alike, there have been ad- herents of these historical faiths who have themselves engaged in the critical analysis and historical investigation of the Holy Scriptures. In synagogue and church alike, we shall continue reverently to hear the Word of the Lord, and yet in our studies boldly essay to scrutinize the Bible text, probe its literary sources, its problems of date, author- ship and composition, in the firm conviction that scholarly results in these fields need not disturb or interrupt our prayer life any more than does the astronomer's exploration of interstellar space. Some years ago Professor Margolis called for scientific method in biblical studies: "True criticism," he wrote, "will bend before no opinion * An Introduction to the Old Testament, by Edward J. Young. Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1949, pp. 414. 111</page><page sequence="2">112 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW whether ancient or modern; it recognizes no master but that tradition which when all is said and done is found to be based not on opinion but on fact." He believed that "a measure of 'learned ignorance' will at least save us from that dogmatic assurance which clings to tradition- alists and untraditionalists alike."' He indicated, further, that in higher criticism no less than in lower, the truth lies not here or there, but dis- persed among many witnesses.2 The basic fault with this Introduction by Dr. Young is its confusion of facts with truth. It cuts through the rich texture of historical de- velopments, with their variegated patterns of differing conceptions and opinions, back of which facts lies truth - in all of which facts the truth is to be found and insists upon the selection of some of these facts to the exclusion of others and their unreal exaltation as the truth. Faith and piety may indeed be confronted with ultimate truth. But scholarship is not. It is merely a method of human approach to the truth. It deals with our knowledge of factual data. Its proper realm is that of the differing interpretations which men have placed upon the facts which convey and yet also hide the truth. It concerns itself there- fore with various but tractable data, not with final and irrefutable truth. But the indefiniteness and uncertainty of all this are not at- tractive to tEe sectarian mind. The present work, unfortunately, proceeds from such a mind. It is not a scientific task which the author faces, but the dissemination of partisan propaganda. A few examples will suffice. Consider how Dr. Young propounds the "inner unity" of a composite book like Genesis. In general his position is the same at that allowed by the Roman Pontiff to his re- ligious subjects, viz., that Moses may have based his book on preexistent documents, but is substantially its author, thereby securing the "inner harmony" of its parts. Thus, on p. 56, Dr. Young denies the possibility of underztanding Genesis, ch. 2, without ch. 1. He declares the second chapter to be topical in treatment and only the first creation account to be a chronologically ordered one. He also holds that the anthropo- morphic conceptions of God are identical in both chapters. Neither of these two contentions is sound. Ch. 2 is quite obviously more in the nature of consecutive narration (i.e., it affords "chronological" treat- ment) by reason of its classical prose style, than is the formal and sche- matic ch. 1. And a moment's consideration of how the writer conceived IM. L.

The "inner harmony" of Gen- esis is broken in the first two chapters, whether taken as a literally historical, or as a traditional, literary record. One's faith in the one, creator God revealed in both these chapters is another matter. Again, how of the "underlying unity," say, between the narrative portions of the Pentateuch and legal sections such as principally con- stitute a book like Leviticus? The claim is made by Dr. Young that Lev., ch. 17, links the laws it introduces to the age of Moses, in spite of admitted resemblances in this section to the sixth century prophet Ezekiel. Expressions in ch. 17 are cited which are supposed to "pre- suppose the preceding narrative and legislation of Exodus and Levit- icus." (p. 82) Among these are "Aaron and ... his sons" (v. 2) and "the door of the tabernacle of the congregation" (v. 9), to select but two. Yet it is a fact that neither of these expressions ever occurs exactly thus in the older narrative strands of the Exodus story, or, for that matter, in the text of Ezekiel.3 The different ideas of priesthood and sanctuary which obtained in different periods and are represented by different historical strata of the literature are simply not recognized by Dr. Young. But this is not to say that a document like Lev. 17-26 demonstrates an "underlying unity" with the contiguous materials of the present Pentateuch, and, with them, must proceed from a single author. A similar blinking of facts may be observed in the treatment of Samuel. Dr. Young is convinced, despite the admittedly bad state of the text, that there are no evidences of composite authorship in the book (p. 182). He assumes that its author had written sources on the amazing basis of the Chronicler's allusion to what may be either writ- ten sources at his disposal which were not employed by the author of the David narratives of Samuel-Kings, or may be simply sections of Samuel-Kings (see I Ch. 29:29)! From this piece of circular reasoning (pp. 173 ff.) Dr. Young goes on (p. 180) to lay the blame for inconsis- tency in the story of Saul's relations with David on the alternation of the king's fits of insanity with his lucid moments. He was insane, Dr. Young holds, when he had persecuted David. Yet in the end it is Saul's sanity which shows him that David was indeed his rival - a true no- 3See S. R.

How much more sane to assume that there are indeed di- vergent and in part unharmonized traditions behind such inconsistencies as appear in the book as well as in the occurrences of obvious doublet accounts? But if a writer starts out with the theological premise forced upon his critical thinking or literary sense that, God being their author, the Old Testament books must show "inner harmony" and "underlying unity", what else can one expect? Hence one is not too much surprised to find the unity of Isaiah main- tained by Dr. Young. Chs. 40-66 he believes were written by the Jeru- salem prophet in pre-exilic times, "during the reign of Manasseh" (p. 215 f.). Hence too, Proverbs, except for chs. 29, 30, is the work of Solomon. And Job is assigned the same age as Proverbs. Note this: "We believe that any view which would destroy the unity of the book must be rejected" (p. 313). There you have it. This is traditionalist dogmatism, not honest criticism. Throughout the book a great deal of space is devoted to the state- ment and defence of outmoded theories, such as those based on Tal- mudic traditions regarding authorship of the various books, with which must be classed the New Testament evidences of first century Jewish and Christian opinion. The history of modern Pentateuch criticism, on the other hand, which constitutes a whole chapter of forty-five pages (equivalent to any four of the preceding chapters on the books of Moses), serves only to point out the apparent confusion which has always attended scientific investigation and consequently suggests to to the dogmatic mind that such investigation and the discussion it breeds are futile. An historical approach would rather be appreciative of variety in understanding of critical views and would underscore the substantial gains in our knowledge of the human situation and processes under- lying the composition of a work like the Pentateuch. But not so the traditionalist approach of Dr. Young. His conclusion seems to be that the difficulties in criticism are greater than those in traditionalism; therefore we had better abide by tradition. Certainly the Copernican theory of our universe, or planetary system, was harder for sixteenth century minds to grasp than the Ptolemaic. And there remained some loose ends in it: Kepler had to correct Copernicus' idea of the planets' circular orbits, and some planets remained undiscovered for centuries after the general adoption of the system by astronomers. Had it been</page><page sequence="5">INTRODUCTION TO OLD TESTAMENT-COOPER 115 better, then, to set it aside for what the Bible clearly says about the firmament above and the sun's motion across it? Happily, it may be asserted with confidence that only a very small minority of teachers and ministers in the major Protestant denomina- tions will consider this work useful or significant. And surely no one outside of English speaking Protestant Christianity should imagine for one moment that it represents more than a sectarian view. For its theological premises war against real Biblical scholarship. CHARLES M. COOPER Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia</page></plain_text>
