<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROBERT MARTIN ADAMS Down Among the Phenomena JL he reader moyen-sensuel (if such there be), who has been hearing for a decade now reverberations out of Paris about the nouveau roman?vague but tremendous reverberations, rather like a DeGaulle press conference, from which one gathers that something or other is going to be done in the highest possible style worthy in every respect of the noblest traditions of France if the radical socialists can be got to agree and it doesn't rain on Thursday?such a reader, who has looked at a couple of the novels of Alain Robbe-Grillet, contemplated the existence of Nathalie Sarraute, and finds himself responding earnestly, "Oh, yes," when reminded of Claude Simon and Michel Butor?such a reader, re? sponsible, industrious, and vaguely worried by the never-ending chase to Keep Up, may well look with glad eyes upon M. Robbe- Grillet's collection of essays and occasional pieces, translated by Richard Howard and put out in this country under the title For a New Novel (Grove Press, 1965). Here, he may well hope, is to be found the finely-distilled essence of M. Robbe-Grillet's lucid Gal? lic thought; here the articulated prism will be seen in which orig? inate all those displays of flashing lights, critical thunderstorms, and general rumblebumble. Such a reader will certainly be dis? appointed. When M. Robbe-Grillet asserts that he is "not a the? oretician of the novel," he makes what may well be the under? statement of the decade. What is more, he has not even tried very hard to be a theoretician of the novel, or his own novel, or any? one's novel. His little booklet comprises a set of manifestos, ra? tionalizations, reconsiderations, rebuttals, and incidental essays dating from the decade between 1953 and 1963. Some of the reconsiderations and appreciations are eloquent; some of the de? fences have the coiled energy of goal-line stands; but the book does not lay down very many or very striking foundations for a new fiction. Among the most prominent and strongly labored the? oretical formulations to which it attains are these: that a modern novelist need not and should not write novels after the fashion of</page><page sequence="2">256 THE HUDSON REVIEW Honor? de Balzac, who lived some time ago; and further, that the artistic value of a work does not depend on its serviceability to a social revolution or an ideology. These positions are worked out, rather laboriously perhaps for a post-World-War-II generation, but at least to unqualified and unremarkable conclusions. And when M. Robbe-Grillet tries to advance beyond these emplace? ments, he becomes, at best, confusing. Two questions on which he gives contrary indications are these: What is the status of objects in his fiction? and what is the status of people? On the whole, when the nouveau roman was nouveau, M. Robbe-Grillet seemed disposed to answer these important questions by putting things up and people down; and M. Roland Barthes, in two early and important studies of Robbe-Grillet (Critique, July-August, 1954; September-October, 1955), cate? gorically qualified the method of the nouveau roman as chosisme ?"thing-ism" in effect. Marks of this early parti pris linger among the older manifestos reprinted in For a New Novel. We find Robbe-Grillet talking about the writer's obligation to render the surface of objects as objects, and to refrain from anthropomorph? izing the world. He does not seem to have gone quite as far as Mme. Sarraute, whose outright attack on the psychologizing novel as an antique fad of Virginia Woolf's may be found in L'Ere du Soupgon; but a phrase like "the destitution of the old myths of profondeur" could be flung forth, and seemed to imply a deliber? ate option for depersonalizing fiction. The new preferences, which derived from a background, more or less profound, in phe? nomenology, seemed to be for an almost mechanical novel, writ? ten in words which should locate, limit, measure, or define, rather than in visceral, analogical, or incantatory language.1 And this seemed, for a while, to be the central convention of the nouveau roman. But at this point (about a decade ago) voices of challenge, 1 By "incantatory" language, M. Robbe-Grillet seems to mean short-term rhythmic repetition; his novels are, of course, replete with long-term episodic repetitions, which have a particularly hypnotic effect?or would, if the overlays and repeats did not often involve a small, significant variation, a minor inconsistency. Particu? larly when two characters repeat a verbally-almost-identical action (or when one character mirror-images the action of another), we get a kind of large-scale fictional zeugma, a yoking of like disparates, which contributes to the special shimmering effect of the obsessed vision. My colleague, Professor David Grossvogel, tells me that Robbe-Grillet has at various times contemplated a story written on separate cards, to be shuffled and reshuffled by the reader to produce a free multiplicity of effect. I am much indebted to Professor Grossvogel for help with this paper.</page><page sequence="3">ROBERT MARTIN ADAMS 257 protest, and inquiry began to be raised. An outcry from tradi? tionalists was only to be expected. Eliminating people from fic? tion, erasing emotion from fiction, could only seem perverse to those reared in an older tradition; its effect, they added, would be to render the novel amoral, undramatic, and dull. But such pro? tests could easily be discounted as the work of foot-dragging neo- Balzacians; a more interesting line of thought opened up through the observation that M. Robbe-Grillet's own novels did not prop? erly exemplify his theory if his theory was what it seemed to be.2 The texture of Les Gommes, and even more patently that of Le Voyeur and La Jalousie, were bound together by a thick amalgam of psychology. The objectivity of the observation in these novels was only pseudo-objectivity; under the cool, accurate surface was to be felt (and one made no sense of the novels unless one did feel) the boiling of deep psychological turmoil. Obsession was one profound root of the stasis and repetition in the fiction; there were moments in which one could actually see the thought proc? esses stammering to a stop in the face of some overwhelmingly ob? sessive vision. The chief observer of Le Voyeur, Mathias, was a rapist and child-murderer in the immediate circumstances of his crime (of course, characteristically, it was not precluded that the crime or crimes of Mathias never took place at all, that the whole structure of the fiction was built on a delusion). La Jalousie fo- cussed on the mind of a man in the toils of obsessive suspicion. The only sense in which these were works without psychology, and psychology in depth, was that in which psychology was the answer to a puzzle posed by objective observation. The nouveau 2 For convenience' sake, I list the novels below, under their French titles, with French date of publication, then under their English titles with date of translation.

Actually, psychology in depth was the fiction's center of interest precisely because of its absence. Under fire, thus, from two directions, M. Robbe-Grillet pro? ceeded, after a fashion, to explain himself, or at least to issue statements after the manner of a man whose fitness to hold public office has been impugned; and some of his comments are re? printed in For a New Novel, where they tend to confuse, as much as to clarify the issues. But the process of getting things straight was complicated by two circumstances over and above M. Robbe- Grillet's addiction to the straight-faced platitude: nouveaux ro- mans continued to be written (by M. Robbe-Grillet and others), and critics, having read them, continued to produce theories of the nouveau roman. Some of these theories seemed to be more re? assuring for the new novelists, though reassurance was the last thing of which M. Robbe-Grillet himself seemed to stand in need, than any which they had been able to concoct themselves. Profes? sor Bruce Morrissette, of the University of Chicago, informed M. Robbe-Grillet that objects occupied within his universe, and in relation to his characters, the position of objective correlatives. Enchanted with the new formulation, M. Robbe-Grillet con? gratulated (whether ironically or otherwise we had better not ask) Professor Morrissette on his discovery of such elegant and apt terminology, and thanked him for inventing it. Of course Pro? fessor Morrissette declined the soft impeachment of originality. But, original or not, where did M. Robbe-Grillet's acceptance of the term (if he really accepted it) leave the issue of anthropo? morphizing or not anthropomorphizing the world? Nothing could better accomplish this (presumably) evil purpose than the theory and practice of the objective correlative. The correlation, in this curious phrase, is always more operative than the objectiv? ity, and in fact works to undermine it. The whole concept pre? sumes that what was first perceived as an objective fact will ulti? mately be revealed as a "significant" symbol. When and if this happens, the old myths of depth are back with us full force. The whole matter might have been written off as one of those aberrant cross-cultural misunderstandings which are likely to afflict rela? tions between Paris and Chicago?except that Professor Morris-</page><page sequence="5">ROBERT MARTIN ADAMS 259 sette proved himself a useful, an almost counter-revolutionary reader of Robbe-Grillet. When he demonstrated (in a series of studies issued separately but later united under the title Les Ro? mans de Robbe-Grillet) that Les Gommes was a detailed, almost point-by-point retelling of the Oedipus myth, when he argued convincingly that the real voyeur in Le Voyeur was not Mathias (whoever else it was),3 and that the climax of that novel was a hallucinated collapse of the guilt-ridden protagonist, he left cho- sisme not much more than half a leg to stand on. His reading of the novels uncovered elements of unquestionable presence in the novels, the keys he flourished in admirable enthusiasm actually worked in the locks to which he applied them. Only one question remained: in the nouveau roman, so interpreted and understood, what exactly was nouveau? This question was, and remains, of some importance only be? cause the novels of Robbe-Grillet include, arguably, a couple of the most intricate, interesting, and admirable fictions of our time. One doesn't need much theory of the novel or background in phe? nomenology to see this; a sharp ear, a keen eye for detail, and a readiness to play the fictional game hard are equipment enough for the enjoyment of most of the novels (I confess to a feeling that Dans le Labyrinthe is a little tiresome in its cute round-and- rounds). But a reader fleshed upon Joyce and Nabokov and Kafka and Borges (i.e., hard-shell fiction), will not, it seems to me, find anything very unfamiliar in most of the nouveaux romans as M. Robbe-Grillet has created them. His sort of novel is highly pat? terned, carefully structured, and involves an intricate game of evi? dence played with/against the reader. The style is cool, unor- chestrated; there is no overt effort to make the reader weep, shudder, or feel ecstatic. There is no editorializing; there is no poetic justice. The prevailing theme is of grotesque tragicomedy tempered by intellectual distance, skilfully blurred outlines, un? certainty raised to an intellectual principle. Impersonal descrip- s In translating, or not translating, this title, Mr. Howard solved a lot of prob? lems the easy way. Voyeur in French has by no means the exclusively pathological significance that the word carries in English; it can also mean simply, "watcher." It seems, indeed, that in unpublished versions of the story, Mathias was not a voyeur at all but a voyageur, and this may have been the first title of the novel. The alternative to Mathias is the voyeur of the novel, is Julien Marek, who watched, or may have watched, or was in a position to watch the murder (if there was a murder) being committed.</page><page sequence="6">26o THE HUDSON REVIEW tion is, indeed, somewhat more prominent in M. Robbe-Grillet's fiction than in that of his predecessors; but the difference is only one of degree. Stephen Crane is also very fond of impersonal de? scription, and very often uses it in much the same way as Robbe- Grillet does?as an immediate screen behind which may be sensed the throbbing of a personal emotion, drawn tight against a refusal to admit it. Further examples of the same literary process could be uncovered in E. Hemingway, R. Chandler, D. Hammett, G. Sim- enon, and x number of hard-guy writers. There may be a back? ground for the device in movies, where dialogue often diverges widely from vision, and to good effect. But in any case, it seems dubious that Robbe-Grillet's use of description alone (unless ac? companied by a whole new metaphysic of perception, intellection, and fictional representation) entitles his fiction to the status of a new school. Neither would mere thematic repetition, whether in? cremental or otherwise. This not very stunning point can also be reached in another way, via the observation that the new novelists, as traditionally identified, don't seem to have an immense amount in common with one another, or with M. Robbe-Grillet; they don't constitute an outstandingly homogeneous group. M. Claude Simon and M. Michel Butor do not seem to have accepted the destitution of the old myths of depth to anything like the degree apparent in Robbe-Grillet; their work draws on emotions like nostalgia, and is penetrated by concepts like duration, history, and the past. Of course M. Robbe-Grillet as Professor Morrissette reads him comes close to these crimes too; but the satellites are more overt about it, and the Gallic school of high phenomenology seems to have cast them off as unworthy. Mme. Sarraute, whose chosisme if it exists seems largely confined to her criticism, works not on the sur? face of objects but on that of the experiencing mind; her work is closer to classic stream-of-consciousness. Her narration flows more smoothly because it involves less effort to coordinate or under? stand an exterior problem (and so less retracking because of fail? ure) than the eddying stream of a Robbe-Grillet investigation. Apart from not being half so sharp and dramatic a novelist, she is not really very like the younger writer who has become (for a moment, anyhow) chef d'ecole, without even having a very dis? tinct ecole to be chef of.</page><page sequence="7">ROBERT MARTIN ADAMS 26l It is, admittedly, no thundering critical novelty to conclude that there is no proper "school" of nouveau roman; literary schools usually turn out, upon inspection, to be figments. But at least recognition of this fact clears the decks for the question, How little theory do we need, and what sort of theory do we need, to account for the literary facts of M. Robbe-Grillet's career so far? Granted that his novels are characteristically metaphysical- psychological detective stories, what sort of metaphysics and what sort of psychology (if any) do we need in order properly to under? stand and appreciate them? Apparently one must begin by discounting Professor Morrissette, though not without gratitude. The treatment of classic myth in Les Gommes is ironic, parodic, intentionally misleading; it exists within the novel, but bears no such serious structural significance as Professor Morrissette assigned it. Further, the use of myth in Les Gommes is exceptional; the novel is unique within Robbe- Grillet's oeuvre precisely in admitting myth at all, and it does so only grudgingly, ironically, as a way of getting rid of it. Myth is a trap into which the protagonist (and behind him the reader) is constantly falling or about to fall; it is a disaster ironically con? ceived and wholly beside the real point. In lieu of myth, depth, human significance, we are to have pattern; and in Le Voyeur we do get a pattern of figure eights which is deeply worked into the structure as well as the decoration of the novel. Mathias describes figure eights all over the island, cuts a figure eight in time (two circular spans of time connected at a point), and is haunted every? where by visions of figure eights on the quais (as iron bolts), in the skies (as spiralling seagulls), on walls (as graffiti), every? where. But this pattern-play, though all sorts of fun for the reader, and built into the novel's big pattern, merely carries a little fur? ther the intricate use of pattern which one finds in Kafka?for in? stance, the phantasmal triads which operate so vigorously in the Metamorphosis or The Trial. Its aim is to tantalize as well as to express; it involves a reader in making and breaking patterns, forces him to reach, stumble, hesitate, fall, taking advantage of the impulses to order, equilibrium, and allegory within his mind as he reads the story. This is a variety of mimesis for which, it may be, nothing prepares us quite so well as a reading of Kenneth Burke's Philosophy of Literary Form. Its potential for invoking</page><page sequence="8">26s&gt; THE HUDSON REVIEW the reader's active sympathies is immense; but using it does not quite qualify a novelist as the founder of a new school of fiction? at least not in the late 50's and 6o's. No, if M. Robbe-Grillet has a new thing here, I think its new? ness will likely appear somewhere in connection with the status of the object in his fiction. And so, in effect, it does. The object is immensely important in, is exactly at the forefront of, Le Voyeur and La Jalousie because both these novels build their structures around a hollow in the continuum of space, an interruption in the river of time. The perhaps-murder committed by Mathias takes place (on page 88 of the French edition, which is a perfect and absolute blank) precisely during a void of time and space in the narration. The possible infidelity of A?with Franck may have taken place, if it took place at all, during a lost gap of time un? represented within La Jalousie. It is because one neant yawns just the other side of the object, and the world of mythical, temporal, and conventional structuring gapes across another neant just this side of it, that the object itself must be seen in such hard and glit? tering outline, measured with such aseptic and mathematical pre? cision. An untimely metaphor will expropriate the object one way into its merely human values; a mere trick or accident of time may cause it to drop off the other way into a gaping expanse of nothingness. In this precarious world, even people may strip off elements of their personalities, be deprived of their accumu? lated characteristics and qualities. Not only the characters and properties within the novel, but the novel in relation to its readers, is subject to an immense and systematic game of transformation, illusion, contradiction?and hence uncertainty. A character is walking through a snowstorm; he is walking through a rainstorm; he is walking through a sand? storm. It is high noon, it is midnight, one can't possibly tell what time it is. His name is Johnson or Johnstone or Jonestone. He passes a storewindow dummy with a wolfhound on a leash; re? turning a moment later, he finds the wolfhound is now a poodle. The work in which he appears is a work of pure fantasy and rep? resents no actuality at all; it is the fruit of long experience, and represents actuality with the greatest meticulousness. The little "Priere d'inserer" notices in the French editions (they never sur? vive in the English translations) give wildly discordant informa-</page><page sequence="9">ROBERT MARTIN ADAMS 263 tion about the books; in his interviews and public statements, the novelist feels free to say wholly discrepant and incompatible things about them. The impulse to locate, limit, measure, and de? fine is evidently up against a potent antagonist which affects even the author in his weak attempts to mediate his own book. Perhaps it is omnipresent neant, perhaps merely the perverse impulse to unsettle everything. In either event, one cannot doubt that be? tween obsessive themes, perverse style, and void-oriented philos? ophy, Robbe-Grillet's fiction exercises to the limit a reader's sense of fictional balance. Of these three elements, it seems best to assume that the philos? ophy of phenomenology predominates?if only on the grounds that it alone promises to raise the analysis a stage above parlor- games. And the reader who wants to find this point of view de? veloped with persuasive force cannot do better than turn to the book of yet another American critic, Mme. Olga Bernal, whose profuse and vehement exposition of the dialectic of phenomenol? ogy sometimes threatens to erode out of the novels of Robbe- Grillet a good deal of their independent dignity as works of art. The facts of literary history, on the chronicle-level, do not much interest Mme. Bernal; she grounds her study on metaphysical in? tuitions and deduces from them with admirable assurance and di? rectness. To criticize the resulting system as philosophy is beyond this commentator, and to criticize it as literary criticism seems mostly irrelevant. What seems indisputable is that in rearing her structure Mme. Bernal has been able to incorporate a good deal of material from Robbe-Grillet's fiction; as a result of which her vol? ume (subtitled Le Roman de VAbsence) is understood to have received the most recent cachet of M. Robbe-Grillet's approval (but whether he meant it any more seriously than his previous gestures in this direction we cannot, of course, be sure). There are, however, a couple of reservations about Mme. Ber- nal's high-style, phenomenologically-oriented Robbe-Grillet, even if warranted by the author himself. For one thing, it is by no means clear why, when Nature recites to one the myth of univer? sal void, vacancy, and nothingness, she is being less mythological than when she recites the myth of human progress, that of inevi? table destiny, or any other given myth. Mme. Bernal points proudly to empty houses, vacant niches, cracks in the plaster, and</page><page sequence="10">264 THE HUDSON REVIEW mirrors which reflect only other mirrors, in token that Le Voyeur is a void-fascinated novel. Of course the success of this argument involves the inevitable downfall of that other one which depre? cates the anthropomorphising of nature. Nature has been reading Heidegger instead of Bergson, and now addresses us in a Swabian accent with a terminology fresh out of Was ist Philosophic??but she's still preaching. No doubt there are philosophical ways around this momentary paradox; but it may lead also to another consideration. For Noth? ing is chiefly Nothing as one encounters it when expecting Some? thing, or, more precisely, Something Else. When one expects mere nothing (a real lapse in a major continuity) and encounters an ingenious emblem of Nothing, it has all sorts of repercussions quite alien to the experience of void; among them might be con? firmation, exultation, complicity, appreciation of the author's, or nature's, ingenuity. Already we have contaminated Nothing, al? most as radically as with depth-psychology; the contamination comes from the structuring of the fiction and (through it) of the reader's responses. And the same thing holds with plot as with symbolism. Mme. Bernal tells us that Les Gommes is a detective story without a crime, without a criminal, with nothing at its root but an accident; that Dans le Labyrinthe portrays a soldier seek? ing to deliver a parcel for which there is no proper destination. In a word, Mme. Bernal sees the detective stories as pseudo-detective- stories, the voyages as non-voyages or anti-voyages, the novels gen? erally as destructive of their own givens, including the reader's ex? pectation of a novel. It's hard to say that this view is altogether wrong. But on these terms, M. Robbe-Grillet is merely exploiting a set of expectations built up by traditional fiction. He is writing shaggy-dog stories?stories the whole impact of which depends on the expectation set up by other, very unlike, stories. The exercise is a limited one, and if there's no more to be had from it than a sense of unlimited indeterminacy and a conviction that the novel- istic cards have been hopelessly stacked against us, it's doubtful if the books will have many re-readers. It would be like re-reading an absolutely convincing argument in favor of suicide. A central problem may well be that of time?time, which the novels, with their resolute limitation to the present tense and the restricted physical observation, resolutely hold at bay, while at the</page><page sequence="11">ROBERT MARTIN ADAMS 265 same time it remains the ambience within which story-teller and story-follower necessarily swim. We have grown accustomed to many different ways of moving and relating within fictional time ?forwards, backwards, through spirals, ellipses, time-gaps, and time-overlays. The new reader is agile at following the new novel? ist through imaginary time. But he is spurred forward in his ef? forts by an unfolding awareness which measures and rewards his own personal concern as reader. If Mme. Bernal is right, the reader of a Robbe-Grillet novel makes no progress whatever in this direction. There is no progress to be made. The reader does not even discover that he cannot, for some inherent reason, know the solution to a mystery. This in itself would be a form of as? surance, a categorical assertion; and he is entitled to no such com? fort. He may feel on occasion that he has reached a momentary and limited confidence; but, however secure it seems, it may dis? solve into the miasma of uncertainty which is experience unco? ordinated and unintegrated by a consciousness. Any ordering of the world of accident would itself constitute a new myth, and so must be sternly disappointed. Mme. Bernal's explanation of the phenomenological dialectic exists, not in time, toward a specific event or away from it, but in that present, "fictitious" after its own fashion, of philosophical discourse in general. She co-opts evidence from the novels bodily into it, depriving them (with butcherly impassivity) of their dra? matic contexts, their temporal progression, whether seen as the time of characters in a story or the time of a reader in a mental action. Yet it is the impulse to temporal order that M. Robbe- Grillet counts on to keep his reader reading. If any of his novels carried the full conviction of what Mme. Bernal announces as their message, that conviction would automatically prevent our reading the others. For the author this is no doubt a very wel? come absurdity, mirroring a larger absurd human predicament. But it clashes on the crude historical fact that the novels are in fact interesting to read and to re-read?not only interesting, but fascinating. The quality of imagination in them is by no means cut and dried, far less dominated by a hidebound, a priori, meta? physical theory. Total meaninglessness (if this is the effect they aim at) turns out to have immense complexities of resonance, so that even if we were assured in advance that each novel was an</page><page sequence="12">266 THE HUDSON REVIEW adventure leading nowhere, we should still find the journey full of fresh significance each time we took it. The myth of depth may have been banished from the concept of fictional character, at least by intention; but this doesn't seem to have affected the qual? ity of depth in the novel itself. Probably it does not matter too much whether we read Robbe-Grillet's novels as policiers or anti- policiers, since in either event curiosity and inventiveness are openly pitted against an antagonist?only the position of the nov? elist within the economy of the fiction is in question. But whether either view is compatible with the curiously schematic and a priori phenomenology (an odd contradiction right there!) attrib? uted to him by the best of his critics, seems much more dubious. So there it is?an impasse. The best way to understand the nov? els is by no means the best way to read them; ultimately, it is in? compatible with reading them at all, or at least with reading them as novels. No wonder the book of critical theory which M. Robbe- Grillet produced is a mess; no wonder the composition of his oeuvre has often seemed to be a collective, not to say eclectic, process, with helpful hints from American professors being gra? ciously if perhaps indiscriminately welcomed by M. Robbe-Grillet as explanations of what he is trying to do. Yet what he does in his fiction (for his work in the movies has been deliberately kept out of this discussion, as a complicating consideration) is marked by little sense of the provisional or tentative, and less sense of the de? veloping or enlarging. Having served little or no apprenticeship to the craft of fiction, Mr. Robbe-Grillet turned, as it were, direct from agronomy to fiction of a high order. Les Gommes, Le Voy? eur, La Jalousie, and Dans le Labyrinthe appeared within the space of six years (from 1953 to 1959); they do not cut an arc of developing mastery, they point no particular arrow toward the future. There is, perhaps, a perceptible measure of development between the first and the second; there is a much more question? able falling-off between the third and the fourth. The period be? tween 1959 and 1965 seems sufficiently accounted for by M. Robbe-Grillet's absorption in movie-making; Marienbad and LTmmortelle were its products. The most recent novel (La Mai- son de Rendezvous, 1965) is proclaimed by its author (but again, was he kidding?) as an altogether fresh departure, but it is noth? ing of the sort. We have an indeterminate number of sex-, dope-,</page><page sequence="13">ROBERT MARTIN ADAMS 267 and/or espionage-counterespionage-murders, committed probably in Hong Kong by and upon characters with an indeterminate number of names and perhaps identities, to be" explained by a riotously proliferating number of hypotheses propounded by a continually shifting series of narrators. Among these narrative personae is one ostentatiously first-person fellow, whose presence startles the ardent Robbe-Grilletian in the early stages of the novel; but if this is the fresh departure, he leads exactly where the impersonal narrators do?to compounded uncertainty; and his success in doing so casts doubt on all the rationales which have been given for his systematic exclusion from the first four novels. Far from giving a new direction to the career of Alain Robbe- Grillet, La Maison de Rendezvous merely confirms the uniform? ity of his vision (obsessive) and of his techniques (overlay and undercut), It is not strikingly a better or worse Robbe-Grillet novel, nor even a different one; it is simply another. No doubt it is chiefly because new directions in fiction are so much in demand that aspirants to the position of "new novel," wherever they appear, are bound to be interrogated with particu? lar intensity. Modern culture gnaws more fiercely every day at traditional notions of human nature?whether its assaults be iden? tified with environmental painting, pop/op art, existential philos? ophy, or in what passes for fiction. Everywhere the sense of hollow where there used to be center, of facade where there used to be solidity, of mechanical conditioning where there used to be spon? taneous desire, calls out for expression. The crisis of fiction is an old story. Under the circumstances, and for a while at least, that writer may well go the farthest who is not too sure of where he is going. But in the end, it is the business of everyone who cares about fiction to seek out the new ways, or at least to make an ef? fort toward charting them. Such a land-surveyor won't get even a minimum of help from M. Robbe-Grillet's theory; but his prac? tice is another story (if, indeed, it's a story at all).</page></plain_text>
