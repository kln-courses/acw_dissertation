Yes, they turn their backs to me, never their faces; but when in trouble they invoke, Arise, save us. ?Jeremiah 2, 27. I ONG the beings known TO US, the human being is, so far as we are aware, the only one to trouble himself about his origins. Mountains have no more care for such matters than it is in their power to leap like rams. As for the rams, they have perhaps some mute memory of their parents, and some abiding affection for them, yet they clearly lack all ambition to retrace the steps of their ovine past. We alone de sire to know whence we came. It is true that some among us manifest this desire in an obsession about "ethnic origins," for example, but this need not signify that our interest in our predecessors must be a purely parochial affair. While a concern for our past seems to be peculiar to our species, and while it necessarily finds its initial expression in ques tions about our immediate precursors, origins being what they are, we cannot long wonder about our own without soon having to consider the origins of the whole human race, and of everything else besides. In modern times it has fallen above all to natural science to get to the bottom of things, and no one would ever think to accuse it of paro chial narrowness. To the contrary, so adept has modern science be come at taking the long view, the view sub specie aeternitatis, in Spinoza's memorable phrase, that even when we recall that it too has a past, we usually dismiss it as irrelevant to its purpose.

MCCARTHY derivative a reality as the things normally subjected to its scrutiny, which suggests that it ought, in seeking to uncover the beginnings of things, also to account for its own peculiar origins. This task is much less straightforward than it may appear. Whatever it is that makes modern science distictively "modern"?and the lack of agreement among those who have made it their particular concern to investigate the birth indicates just how intricate and obscure is even this much of its history?one can safely say that the remote beginnings of modern natural science antedate modernity. Indeed, they were surely in place long before the dawn of properly scientific inquiry in Greek antiquity. To limit the problem to its barest essentials, it seems that the quest for what is first or ultimate is coeval with human life as such, as is appar ent from the mythical accounts of the beginnings available to us from those "aboriginal" peoples who have survived into modern times. In attaining to a god's eye view of the origins of things, modern natural science would not thereby erase its properly human starting point. To be sure, we can have no direct access to our earliest ances tors: because a human being can only really be known if he decides to let himself be known, and because he lets himself be known princi pally by speaking his mind (even a human deed cannot be understood until one knows what the human agent thinks he is doing), the fur thest reaches of our human past must forever remain somewhat hid den from our gaze. One might therefore be tempted to doubt whether even the most primitive myths that have come down to us are repre sentative of human life at its inception. Upon reflection, however, it is clear that every attempt to speak about the first things, mythical or scientific, ancient and modern, must somehow echo the concerns of the first human beings to walk the earth. Whatever may prove to be the truth about our subhuman antecedents, we could not possibly rec ognize as one of our kind a creature who gave no thought, because he had no thought to give, to what preceded him in being. Thus could Ar istotle assert with his characteristic mixture of self-effacement and self-assurance that "all men by nature yearn to be in the know," and that "all assume that what is called 'wisdom' is concerned with the first causes and principles" of being.1 In sum, although perplexity 1 As if to say that the whole of human history pointed vaguely to his "first philosophy."

In itself, of course, that is no argument against their kinship with science in respect of their genesis. A myth that did not reflect something of man's cognitive estrangement from his origins could in no way serve to explain them, as is attested by the paradoxi cal stories told by our physicists about the primordial beginnings of the cosmos. All the same, and notwithstanding the remarkable resur gence of "neo-paganism," as it styles itself, after several centuries of exposure to modernity, the success of modern science is such that we would not dream of repairing to ancient mythologizing for the truth about the ultimate source of things. No wonder, then, that we seldom pause to consider the characteristically human desire that is at the heart of all speculation, past or present, about the beginnings of it all. Or perhaps such oversight results rather from the nature of desire, which, by directing our attention outward, must in some measure ob scure itself in the very act of asserting itself: hence a man suffering hunger pangs does not ordinarily crave a lecture on metabolic pro cesses, he wants something to eat. Be that as it may, we would do well from time to time to ponder the interest we have in the origins of things. Such reflection is necessary not only in order to know our selves better. It is also indispensable, as I shall argue, should we wish to achieve a truly scientific grasp of our origins. As Aristotle had opined in the opening chapter of the Physics, his own memorable at tempt at a science of nature, the truly natural path to what is first in it self is always by way of what is first for us.3 2 This disparity obtains whether, as some scientists coi\jecture, forms of rational life are to be found scattered throughout the universe, or whether reason is embodied on our planet alone. In view of the age and extent simply of our own solar system, the millenia of human questioning amount to scarcely a strut upon a gigantine stage; and even the most sanguine of re searchers dare not hope that rational inquiry has materialized on more than a small proportion of planets. 3Physics 1.1.184al0-184bl5.</page><page sequence="4">838 JOHN C. MCCARTHY II What is it that makes our desire to retrieve our past so distinc tive, or so human? The Alps rise majestically above us, but for all their splendor and serenity, they have done nothing to attain their present stature, being merely the outcome, indeed the inevitable out come, of the geophysical forces encompassing them. In comparison, the sheep that graze on alpine slopes are actually much more impres sive beings. By virtue of their legs, their appetites, and their rudimen tary awareness of their environment, they are able to introduce some, if only minimal, distance between themselves and their starting point. Yet despite their freedom to wander up hill and down valley, they re main almost totally absorbed in, and so captive to, the present mo ment.4 Not so the human being, who rambles the whole planet over, and even dreams of life in remote galaxies, because wherever he is, he does not ever feel fully at home. No moment or place seems quite ad equate to him. This is certainly no fault of the planet. It is a common place that the most restless people on earth, the Americans, have more to go home to than do any other people in history.5 Earthly sat isfactions seem only to aggravate what look very much like our un earthly needs. We wander for many reasons, of course, and in many different ways. At bottom, however, our roaming expresses a com mon hope, however vaguely apprehended, that we will chance upon a way to make sense of our lives and our circumstances, about which we know enough to recognize that they are too contingent to be self explanatory. The human interest in origins, the desire to attain to the uncontingent ground from which all else derives, is thus the noetic root of the strange discontentedness characteristic of our race. Somehow we divine that in understanding the source of things, and our relation to that source, we will find ourselves in our rightful place. Several distinctive features of this distinctive desire may be iden tified. To begin, when the ram's appetite steers him toward a patch of 4 See Friedrich Nietzsche, On the Advantage and Disadvantage of His tory for Life, trans. Peter Preuss (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1980), 1.8-9. 5 Alexis de Tocqueville provides the classic discussion of this paradox, for which, see vol. 2, De la d?mocratie en Am?rique (Paris: Gallimard, 1986), part 2, chapters 10-13, 181-94; chapter 19, 215-20; part 3, chapter 16, 310-13.

In desiring to know our origins, what we pursue is the truth about them, which we will succeed in grasping only when we manage to let them be precisely as they were before we found them.6 More generally stated, because the object of the ram's appetite is always directed to ward a particular aspect of a particular thing, both he and it are sub ject to "competitive pressure." The truth, contrarily, is something uni versal, which means, among other things, that in desiring it we aspire to that which can be shared with other knowing beings without any loss to us or diminishment of it. Or rather, what portion of the truth we attain to must be shared if we are to ensure our possession of it. In traditional terms, our desire to know our origins is a desire for some thing "immaterial," even if the first things should ultimately prove as solid or impenetrable as the atoms of Democritus. Although the desire to know from whence we came is not in itself competitive, there is nothing in the world quite so ambitious as this common human aspiration. In comparison, even Alexander the Great's bid to subject the whole world to his rule is rather modest in scope. The truth may be immaterial, but it is not an airy nothing, espe cially when the truth in question concerns the first things. Precisely because it is in the nature of an origin to contain "in principle," as we say, all that derives from it, we have here to do with a comprehensive inquiry, one that seeks knowingly to embrace the whole of reality. We will, accordingly, have satisfied our desire to account for our past only when there is nothing else in need of an explanation. Like the imperi alist, although by very different means, he who would grasp the first causes of things aims to render every "foreign policy" obsolete.7 An interest in the truth about the whole is by definition "impar tial." A certain detachment is both required for, and the consequence of, every serious attempt to investigate the first things. Quotidian cares may, of course, occasion our wonder about the ultimate ground of things?Newton's apple if the stuff of legend?but only when they provoke us to look beyond what is immediately at hand, and when we 6 On the forms of "consumption," see Leon R.

MCCARTHY cease to take the world of ordinary and everyday experience for granted. By the same token, an ascent in the direction of what is onto logically prior cannot help but put our own particular point of view "into perspective," as we say. Detachment is not indifference, how ever. Not only is it impossible for a human being to abandon his every allegiance to what is secondary or derivative. To strive to do so, out of a misbegotten sense of "objectivity," would not be the least scien tific. After all, the desire that initially set the inquiry in motion, and that keeps it alive in the face of the inevitable obstacles to its satisfac tion, is an eminently personal affair. So too, one's life and one's cir cumstances provide the ultimate test of the explanatory power of any putative science of origins. Wholehearted engagement with the par ticular features of one's life is therefore both cause and effect of the detachment leading to and from an impartial grasp of the whole that contains it. An impartial interest in the whole is in no way at odds with a qualified attachment to the human part.8 The activation of the desire to know the first things is far more dependent upon our initiative than merely animal appetite. In the presence of food a ravenous wolf will necessarily salivate, whereas the world in its entirety is quite powerless to compel an ignorant man to pose even a simple question. This is not to say, with Bacon and Kant, that reason must compel nature to yield its truths. Such talk leaves little or no room for things to invite our wonderment, as they often seem to do. No one would deny that science presupposes that the world is in some sense intelligible; intelligibility is, however, noth ing other than the power to appeal to, or draw out, our intelligence by soliciting our questions and proffering possible answers; and as re gards the question of origins in particular, we would never think to look for the causes of things lying closest to hand if they did not some how point beyond themselves, signaling to us that they do not cause themselves to be.9 Still, it is up to us whether to follow the world's lead or to ignore it. Neither instinct nor habituation suffices to launch, guide, or perpetuate our inquiry into the first things. In short, while we do not cause ourselves to be the kinds of beings that we are, 8 See my "Some Preliminary Remarks on 'Cognitive Interest' in Husser lian Phenomenology," Husserl Studies 11 (1995): 135-52. 9 If the questions we put to nature are not questions that nature has somehow already put to us, we would have no basis for distinguishing a rea sonable inquiry from a flight into absurdity; similarly, what is given, the "data" as we call it, would be robbed of all power to guide research, having been reduced to idle stuff to be manipulated at will. See my "The Being of the Maybe: Husserl on Doubting," Man and World 28 (1995): 261-81.</page><page sequence="7">THE DESCENT OF SCIENCE 841 perplexity about the beginnings of things, and fidelity to that perplex ity, is an achievement whose origin lies mysteriously within man him self. Insofar as the origins of things are merely intelligible, and not themselves intelligent, then to the degree that we do come to under stand them, we even contribute in some sense to their originality, as strange as that may sound. This plainly cannot mean that we are able to get back behind the first things, or to subject them to our manipula tion; if we could, they would not be truly original. Yet apart from thoughtful recollection of the thoughtless beginnings of things, those beginnings would be lost to the past, or be present only in a partial way, in their spatially and temporally diffuse effects. When, contrar ily, we mount a rational ascent from such effects to their causes, we begin to gather cause and effect together into a rationally actualized whole. As Thomas Aquinas, developing a hint from Aristotle, was so bold to say, to knowingly uncover the origins of the world is to perfect the world, to bring it to completion. The rational recapitulation of the beginnings of things would mean, in a sense, that there is nothing left to be done in the world. By retrieving our origins in thought we would bring the world back full circle.10 Although the desire to know the first things all but defines our hu manity, it obviously holds sway more or less intensely in different hu man beings, and in the same human being at different times. Further more, we may pursue our interest in origins in more or less appropriate ways, and with more or less adequate results. Hence, in pointing to a common source for modern science and ancient mythol ogizing, I did not mean to blur the real and important differences be tween the two, as has become fashionable among those who would confuse the abuse of science with its proper use.11 To speak with unpardonable economy, natural science takes as its standard of evidence what is, in principle, and at present rationally available to all, 10 Thomas Aquinas, Questiones disputatae de veritate, q. 2, a. 2; and Summa contra gentiles II, c. 46; together with Aristotle De anima 2.11.423b24-6, 3.2.426al5-26, 3.4.429al7-18, 3.7.430al0-17, and 3.8.432al-2.

MCCARTHY whereas myth relies by definition upon hearsay. In effect, the myths close off inquiry almost as soon as it begins, sealing off what they al lege about the beginnings of things in a past accessible only to those whom they themselves obscurely authorize. Science, in contrast, de pends upon and fosters an attitude of radical openness toward what is first and last by refusing to allow its desire for answers to outpace the force of its questions?so long, at least, as it remains true to its call ing.12 Not without reason, then, has modernity accorded the scientist such authority to speak about the origins of things. On the other hand, science merits the confidence we place in it only if it stands ready to display its admittedly partial understanding of the first things as a rational advance beyond earlier, more primitive human attempts to come to terms with them. That is to say, a science of nature worthy of the name must be able to trace its lineage back to its properly hu man roots, which alone can ground a properly human assessment of its ambition and accomplishments. The ascent of science must be vis ible in its descent. In this respect, modern natural science has not been uniformly successful. Ill For some time now, those charged with expounding the results of science to interested members of the public have satisfied them selves as to its unequivocal superiority to earlier efforts to understand our origins, including the efforts of the ancient philosophers and the medieval theologians, by invoking a word originally coined to name a 12 See Aristotle, Metaphysics, 1.2.982bl5-983a5.

According to this doxology, modern science might now and again get some things wrong, just as men in the past had oc casionally gotten some things right. Nevertheless, the story continues, what sets our science apart from its past is its resolute refusal to yield, as men had so often yielded before, to the temptation of "anthropo morphism." Proof of the suasive power of this proposal is that virtu ally no one retains a memory of the Church's struggle against the Egyptian anthropomorphites, while almost everyone is convinced that premodern science perpetuates the allegedly mythological tendency to distort the first things by casting them in comforting and familiar human forms.13 Whatever the truth of this story, and it is not entirely false,14 one must regret the disdain for our predecessors it has generated. For if 13 Augustine mentions the "anthropomorphites" in De haeresibus, c. 50. The Oxford English Dictionary, 2d ed., identifies the English naturalist and thinker George Henry Lewes (1817-78) as among the first to employ the term to designate a fallacious interpretation of the natural, as opposed to the di vine, order (under the words "anthropomorphic," "anthropomorphism"). For a suggestive discussion of anthropomorphism and modern natural science, see Pierre Destr?e, "Finalit? et subjectivit?. Quelques remarques sur l'anthro pomorphisme," ?tudes ph?nom?nologiques 12 (1996): 209-24. 14 As regards the mythmaking that provides the literary background to Biblical story-telling, the shape of ordinary human experience is hardly deter minative, as can be seen from the mythical cosmogenies (and the worlds they deliver) collected in Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testa ment, ed. James B. Pritchard, 3d ed., with supplement (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969). While the Bible, on the other hand, does surely exalt the human form, on no credible reading of that book could one suppose that human life has been made the pattern of the divine; see, for example, Ps. 8, Sirach 18:8. Greek mythology is also both more and less "anthropomorphic" than is commonly supposed. As Seth Benardete, summarizing aspects of Herodotus's "theology," observes: "When we say that the Greek gods are an thropomorphic, we are usually unaware that the term is ambiguous but as sume that the Greek gods are like men because the Greeks are men. It could be, however, that the Greeks are men because their gods are anthropomor phic. Their gods might have been the cause of the Greeks' becoming human beings. What especially excites Herodotus' disgust is the practice of almost all men except the Greeks ... of having intercourse in sanctuaries. Their rea son is that if the gods did not approve of it, they would not allow animals to copulate in their sanctuaries. Most men do not distinguish between them selves and animals. Their failure to make this distinction is shown in their not having anthropomorphic gods, who establish what they can and cannot do. Hesiod and Homer, in giving the Greek gods their human shape, did more than just duplicate human beings. They radically separated human beings from all other living things and stamped them with a specific excellence. The gods thus imposed a standard which the Greeks could look up to, so that they could judge whether to respect or to despise themselves"; Herodotean In quiries (The Hague: Martinus Njjhoff, 1969), 45.</page><page sequence="10">844 JOHN C. MCCARTHY modern science has shown anything about the search for our origins, it is the extraordinary difficulty of the undertaking. Viewed in this light, our forebears deserve grateful admiration, not scorn. Given that the sources of things are so elusive, mistakes were inevitable; such mistakes often proved instructive; and whether they were helps or hindrances to the advancement of learning, their very inadequacy bears witness to the accomplishments of modern science; finally, even the most wrong-headed explanations of the beginnings express the poignancy of the human desire to understand them. There is, however, a still more serious reason not to dismiss our predecessors so off-handedly. Thanks to a belief shared by many of them that the shape of the human things must provide some significant clues as to how things first took shape?thanks to their "anthropomorphism," if you will?the proponents of premodern science rarely succumbed to a blunder to which our modern science is strangely prone: reduction ism. It is not to my purpose to provide a catalogue raison?e of modern reductionism, a task requiring classificatory talents far in excess of Linnaeus.15 Suffice it to mention, as a representative case, the posi tion of Edward O. Wilson, set out most recently in his Consilience: the Unity of Knowledge. Among the book's several merits is that it en deavors to provide a comprehensive vision of modern science. More over, this survey of the scientific enterprise is provided not by some professor of philosophy, whose academic credentials must always 15 The word "reductionism," like every other word ever coined, is prone to slippage. What has been termed "methodological reductionism" might perhaps be taken to describe the normal, and even salutary practice of mod ern natural science. Reductionism of this sort targets for inspection one as pect of a complex whole, understood as such, and does not purport to ex plain the whole as a whole. It is usually contrasted with "ontologicai reductionism," which purports to show that wholes are "nothing but their parts." In addition, the possibility of an "epistemological reductionism" is sometimes mentioned, the concern of which is not the status of natural wholes, but rather the differences between scientific theories across appar ently different domains, and whether one kind of theorizing may be reduced to the essentials of another, biology to chemistry, say, or physics to mathe matics. It is not altogether clear, however, that this species of the thing adds much to the distinction between the other two. See Arthur Peacocke, God and the New Biology (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row Publishers, 1986), 5-20. For purposes of the present discussion, I shall employ the word "reduction ism" unadorned to name that form Peacocke and others qualify as "ontologi cai."</page><page sequence="11">THE DESCENT OF SCIENCE 845 leave him vulnerable to suspicions about his competence; it is the handiwork of an eminent Harvard biologist, a man who has seen a good deal of modern science from the inside, and who is credited by many of his peers as being optimally suited to hold forth upon the sub ject.16 It is thus of some moment that in the opening pages of his book Wilson should admit, with beguiling candor, that he is "guilty, guilty, guilty" of "ontologicai reductionism."17 With this singularly uncontrite confession, Professor Wilson launches his campaign to persuade his readers that reductionism cap tures the truth of science's intentions, past, present, and future. Whether or not he does justice to modern natural science is not for us to say. There can be little doubt, however, that the book as a whole amply confirms the truth of his initial self-disclosure. In what follows, I shall not attempt to recapitulate his often engaging tour of the scien tific horizon. I mean only to call attention to the peculiar way in which his own interest in origins is betrayed by the terms he chooses to de scribe those origins. Like others of his kind, Wilson denies that there are any essential differences between beings. Things may well appear to be really dis tinct from each other; everything really is just more of the same, dif fering only in degree from all the rest. It goes without saying that in a world so homogenized the task of science will be simplified consider ably. One method fits all, Wilson insists, the analytical method, which aims to trace every "complex object" back, by successive stages, to its accidental derivation from the "simple universal laws of physics." In this way, scientific inquiry will culminate in a genetic "history" of the universe wherein everything that is is to be explained by how it came to be.18 His brash assertion that prescientific opinions about the world are "wrong, always wrong" is, therefore, not quite so inconsis tent at it might first appear with his intention to write a book targeted for a general audience. Because the leading premise of Wilson's 16 See, for example, the reviews in Scientific American, June 1998,97-8; Nature, April 2, 1998, 451-2; American Scientist, May/June 1998, 280-3; Journal of the American Medical Association, October 28, 1998, 1455; The American Journal of Psychiatry, December, 1998, 1796-7.

MCCARTHY science is that things never really are what they seem at first to be, it would be quite futile for him to attempt to salvage anything from our prescientific conception of things. On a reductionist reading of real ity, "the world is too remote from ordinary experience" to be accessi ble to it. Sooner or later, then, Wilson must demolish all pretensions of the scientifically untutored mind to know anything about the natu ral order.19 Wisely, he chooses to administer the bitter medicine early on in the book, so that it can do the most good, but not of course be fore taking measures to earn our unwitting affection. Brash assertions have a certain boyish appeal, but one may still find oneself wondering how Wilson can be so confident about the ex planatory power of his science, in view of its manifest inability, in its present state, to provide an adequate explanation for even a single properly human phenomenon. In what way, for example, could the known laws of physics even begin to explain Abraham Lincoln's deci sion on March 12, 1864 to appoint General Ulysses S. Grant com mander of the Union armies? What would be the shape of the formula astute enough to recognize McClellan's performance in that office as a failure, to say nothing of a formula powerful enough to predict that failure?20 Wilson freely concedes, as concede he must, that after more than three centuries of trying, the reductionist program is still largely a promissory note. He even acknowledges that science as he con ceives of it may never manage to fill in all the relevant gaps.21 There can be no doubt, therefore, that his vision of science is not entirely an chored in the world as he knows it scientifically to be. Reductionism, he cheerfully admits, is a "transcendental world view." As if to draw that ponderous bit of philosophical jargon closer to our ordinary ex perience, and thereby render his position more persuasive, he adds 19 Consilience, 45-6: "Without the instruments and accumulated knowl edge of the natural sciences?physics, chemistry, and biology?humans are trapped in a cognitive prison. They are like intelligent fish born in a deep, shadowed pool. Wondering and restless, longing to reach out, they think about the world outside. They invent ingenious speculation and myths about the origin of the confining waters... and the meaning of their own existence. But they are wrong, always wrong." See also 61,119-20, and 183. Wilson no where explains how prescientific opinion can be at once so wrong, and so ca pable of divining that there is a "world outside" the backwaters of mankind's natural ignorance. 20 For this, and related points, see Richard F. Hassing, "Modern Natural Science and the Intelligibility of Human Experience," in Final Causality in Nature and in Human Affairs, ed. Richard F. Hassing (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press, 1997), 211-56. 21 See Consilience, 55, 90-5,122-3,136-7, and 240-1.</page><page sequence="13">THE DESCENT OF SCIENCE 847 that "the challenge and crackling of thin ice are what give science its metaphysical excitement."22 What is most problematic about his and every other scientific re ductionism, however, is not its reliance upon risky hypotheses, or sus pect coiyectures. More troublesome still, in their attempt to reduce human life to its genesis or constitution from subhuman and even sub limate, entities or processes, Wilson and other kindred spirits deprive themselves of the means to explain, and so justify, themselves or their activity as scientists. In this way, the reductionist must eventually part company with science in the strict sense in favor of obscurantism darker than any myth. To be sure, Wilson takes pains to praise "the admirable side of human nature," that which aspires to "construct" a unified account of the whole of nature, and that thereby gives "ulti mate purpose to the intellect."23 Nowhere, however, does he explain how natural science as he construes it leaves room for such things as praise, admirable qualities, unified accounts, and ultimate purposes. The reason, of course, is that he cannot do so. Consider his endorsement of the opinion that the brain or the mind?they are utterly indistinguishable in his presentation?is a "bio logical machine." According to this view, the cerebral mechanism was "assembled" through the efforts of an "impersonal force," which is to say, thanks to some version of Darwinian selection. Its biologically appointed task was not, as we ordinarily suppose, to seek to under stand the world, much less itself. By nature, the "end" of the human brain was simply "to survive."24 Just how did the assemblage of the human brain occur? And granted that "the idiosyncrasies of human evolution" must necessarily have led to a "distorted" sense of the world, how could such a machine have ever yielded the "incidental" possibility of real understanding, a possibility Wilson surely does not doubt?25 Consilience provides scant detail about such matters. In stead, it abruptly shifts from a conjectural history of cerebral evolu tion to a summary presentation of the human brain as it is currently configured. The book's rendering of contemporary neuroscience is necessarily sketchy. The nub of Wilson's summary is his claim that our every thought and desire is the "composition" of "cellular events." 22 Consilience, 55; also 3-6, and 12-14; but compare 29, and 45, for signs of his aversion to the company of the metaphysically minded. 23 Consilience, 13, together with 264. 24 Consilience, 96-8; see also 45-8,129-30, and 165-80. 25 Compare Consilience, 52, and 60-1.</page><page sequence="14">848 JOHN C. MCCARTHY If the brain is a biological machine, then its "product" is "interlacing patterns of neural activity."26 Where is the difficulty in all of this? Let us begin by considering the historical part of his argument, and its leading principle, "survival" apart from "understanding." On its own, this principle obviously can not explain the genesis of the landmarks of human intelligence, as Wilson is perfectly aware. Without presuming to mention his own ac complishments expressly, he confesses that "the great mystery of hu man evolution" is "how to account for calculus and Mozart."27 His "at tempt" to solve this mystery is not easy to make out. For present purposes, it suffices merely to mention his assertion that in the hu man being "biological evolution" cedes at some point, and to some de gree, to "cultural evolution," which henceforth both conditions, and is conditioned by the "epigenetic rules" governing the brain's neural pro cesses. Wilson's expansive use of the term "evolution" is telling: the essentials of Darwinian selection, and its struggle for "survival" con tinue to prevail over properly human "history." The birth and growth of rational self-awareness proves therefore to be but a continuation of life's brutal foreign policy by other means.28 We are therefore compelled to wonder just whose "survival" is to be served by the publication Consilience. The book concludes in a hortatory voice, enjoining us to do all that we can to ensure the con tinuance not only of the human species but of the whole "bio sphere."29 It is surely with relief that we discover that Wilson is a friend to all the living. Yet his call to ecological accountability follows fast upon his treatment of "religion," in which he had reminded us that fond hopes do not a demonstration make.30 His more skeptically minded readers are thereby invited to doubt the wisdom of his stirring 26 Consilience, 96-100,102; see also 106,108-10,112-20,124,164-6, 205, 208, 216, 219, 241, 246, 250-1, and 267. 27 Consilience, 48-9; compare 61, 64, and 213. 28 Consilience, 13,126-8,150,157,164-80, 213, 229-32, and 254. Wilson does allow that "cultural evolution" occasionally generates what we might we call social mutations that of themselves do little or nothing to enhance survival. The terms of such exceptions to Darwin's hard rule are hardly fa vorable, however, to the possibility of Wilson's purported science: "Particu lar features of culture," he writes, "have sometimes emerged that reduce Dar winian fitness, at least for a time. Culture can indeed run wild for a while, and even destroy the individuals that foster it"; Consilience, 158, together with 193. 29 Consilience, 266-98. 30 Consilience, 262: "if history and science have taught us anything, it is that passion and desire are not the same as truth."</page><page sequence="15">THE DESCENT OF SCIENCE 849 peroration to environmental awareness. For however worthy his con cerns for the planet may be, he has done nothing at all to prove that the survival of the human race, or of any other species, will be fur thered rather than thwarted by the public's embrace of science as he conceives of it. This lacuna in his argument is especially noteworthy in view of the suggestion he makes in several other contexts that our continuance is often better served by "illusion" than by truth.31 On the other hand, if "survival" is in fact nature's very own imperative, why need we worry about it? Surely it is her business to enforce her "uni versal laws," if not on earth, and with us in mind, than in some other corner of the universe, and through the generation of creatures more to her liking. Heraclitus conjectured long ago that "the road up and the road down are one and the same," so we should not be surprised that Wilson offers little better than an argument from his own author ity for supposing that his "powerful conservation ethic" of "biodiver sity" follows as a matter of unconditional or even hypothetical neces sity from his neo-Darwinian rendering of the origins of human intelligence.32 Otherwise stated, the terms of Wilsonian science ren der Wilson's moral commitments quaintly high-flown. Perhaps, however, we have been interpreting Consilience in un duly "altruistic" terms. Perhaps the thing means principally to pro mote Wilson's own survival. In that case, however, not just the homily that concludes the book but the work as a whole is ancillary to his real purpose. Yet apart from the fact that a causal connection between the writing and publication of Consilience and the promotion of Wilson's genetic legacy is utterly impossible to verify, his interest in securing his biological continuance scarcely constitutes a recommendation that we subject ourselves to the trouble of reading the thing.33 There is, in short, no reason whatsoever to suppose that the biological "survival" of a person, species, or biosphere suffices either to explain why Consilience came to be written, or to justify its dissemination. Someone might be so generous as to counter on Wilson's behalf that 31 Consilience, 109-10,112-20, 243-8, and 262-5. 32 Consilience, 292 together with 251.

Raven (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1957), 189. 33 Perhaps it is the readers of Consilience whose personal survival is somehow to be prolonged by its publication, although one would have thought that the publisher would have made something of this possibility, considering its rare promise as a marketing device.</page><page sequence="16">850 JOHN C. MCCARTHY as a scientist, he desires the truth above all else: science would cease to be science were it to confine itself only to those matters promising to extend the life-span either of the individual scientist or of the hu man race as a whole. In that case Darwinian selection does not rule human life after all, and Wilson ceases to be a reductionist, but also ceases to say anything of note about science and its human origin. If, as had been suggested long ago, "strife is king,"34 then Wilson's neo-Darwinian efforts to maintain the stance of scientific impartiality and openness are illusory, and quite beside the point. The second, more analytical, moment of his account of mind is just as unsuccess ful at sustaining the appearance of rational detachment that Consil ience works so hard to cultivate. Let us concede, for the sake of the discussion, that the thoughts and desires informing the writing of the book are, like every other mental performance, reducible to merely "cellular events." Because brain cells are as such quite incapable of desiring and conceiving the truth about things, Wilson's convictions, and the purposes that animate them, must be a matter of happen stance, having somehow arisen from the particular configuration of neurons in his particular brain at the particular time they were "pro duced." It follows that he, or rather his brain, can have no reason to suppose that what he finds himself to be saying is actually true or worthy of our interest: while it often seems that we simply "happen" upon some thought, its worth is in no way assured because we "hap pen" to think it true. Nor can Wilson pretend to have offered us any rational basis for agreeing with him, or even for entertaining his claims as candidates for truth. Should we be in sympathy with him, his own argument, if we can call it that, compels him (and us) to con cede that a similar, but certainly not the same, "pattern of neural ac tivity" has coincidentally come about in our own brains (certainly Wil son would not want to argue that changes in his neurophysiology sufficed to bring about changes in ours, which would be to fall back upon action at a distance, a thesis of medieval physics seemingly ridi culed out of existence centuries ago). If, on the other hand, we should find ourselves disagreeing with him, even to the point of wish ing to do him violence, Wilson's words give us ample title to do so. How else are we to act except in conformity with "the massively cou pled aggregates" of "participating circuits" that "compose" our partie 34 See Heraclitus, fragments 213-15, in The Presocratic Philosophers, 195. Or as Wilson cheerily puts it, "Nature is a battlefield, make no mistake." Just how grim Wilson's nature must be becomes clear from his subsequent claim that "Rwanda is a microcosm of the world"; Consilience, 215, 288.</page><page sequence="17">THE DESCENT OF SCIENCE 851 ular thoughts and inclinations? Because one "cellular event" is every bit as "eventful" as another, Consilience effectively puts the broodings of a sociopath, or the ravings of a madman, on the same essential foot ing as the rational assent of a thoughtful reader.35 To sum up, Wilson saws off the very branch he means to sit upon. His express intention in Consilience is to provide a popular presenta tion of his "faith"36 in what he supposes to be a universal science of na ture, a science able in principle to account for all the things that are. In view of such a magnanimous purpose, it would be churlish to ex pect from him an argument subjected to the same formal rigors and numerical precisions that are the norm for scientific studies published in peer-reviewed journals.37 Yet in condescending to speak to a wide audience, he surely cannot believe that the terms of popular discourse permit him to abandon all logic to the four winds. Nevertheless, and notwithstanding Wilson's considerable literary talents, Consilience vi olates a logical rule so basic that it holds for any speech whatsoever: it fails the test of self-reference. The ontologicai reductionism that pur ports to be the substance of his speech undermines the rational pre suppositions underlying his act of speaking. One must therefore say of 35 Consilience, 110. It might here be appropriate to mention that the present difficulty had already been partially anticipated by Charles Darwin. In 1871 Darwin published his The Descent of Man. Some four years later, in a letter penned to one W. Graham, he writes: "you have expressed my inward conviction, though far more vividly and clearly than I could have done, that the Universe is not the result of chance. But then with me the horrid doubt always arises whether the convictions of man's mind, which has been devel oped from the mind of the lower animals, are of any value or are at all trust worthy. Would any one trust in the convictions of a monkey's mind, if there are any convictions in such a mind?" The Life and Letters of Charles Dar win, including an Autobiographical Chapter, ed. Francis Darwin, 2 vols. (New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1896), 1:285. The same misgiving reappears a year later, in his Autobiography (first published, in rather bowdlerized form, in 1887, five years after his death), for which see Charles Darwin and Thomas Henry Huxley, Autobiographies, ed. Gavin de Beer (London: Oxford University Press, 1974), 54. One might add that Darwin's "horrid doubt" ought to have disturbed his confidence not only in the science of natural the ology, but in any science whatsoever. It should therefore come as no sur prise that in attempting to show, in his Descent, that "there is no fundamental difference between man and the higher animals in their mental faculties," Darwin never really confronts the fact of his own inquiry; see The Descent of Man, and Natural Selection in Relation to Sex, 2 vols. (1871; reprint Brus sels: Culture et Civilisation, 1969), 1:34-106, esp. 35, 42, 46-7, 60, 62-3, 68-9, together with 104-6, and 2:390-6, together with 405. 36Consilience, 12. 37 See Consilience, 49-65, for Wilson's description of the proprieties of scientific reasoning.</page><page sequence="18">852 JOHN C. MCCARTHY his book what was once said by a man whom Wilson credits as "the grand architect" of modern natural science regarding science in its pre-modern signification: it is "like some magnificent mass without any foundation."38 IV It goes without saying that the sort of retortive counterargument I have put to Wilson will be perfectly familiar to many of his readers. It enjoys an ancient philosophical pedigree, even though it is straight forward enough that it may easily be employed, mutatis mutandis, against any reductionistic account of the human being.39 Its value is not merely destructive, however, as some may suppose. For by refut ing Wilson and his ilk, it also displays as rationally compelling what cannot be rationally demonstrated, namely, the human preconditions for any science whatsoever. Among such preconditions is obviously the desire to know, that which first sets science in motion. To ac knowledge that such preconditions are rationally indemonstrable is not to concede that they are irrational. It is only to recognize that not everything that is reasonable can be shown to be so by a discursive ar gument: because reason does not cause itself to exist it cannot be held fully responsible for the terms of its existence. If, however, rea son's dependency upon conditions outside its dominion tempts some to fear that human intelligence is something arbitrary, without reli able footing or "foundations," the argument by retorsion should reas sure them that the contingencies of reason do not obliterate reason. We may therefore be grateful for Wilson's confusion.40 38 Francis Bacon, "Epistle Dedicatory," Magna instauratio (which was to serve as the introduction to the Novum organum, Bacon's replacement for the old, Aristotelian organon), in The Works of Francis Bacon, ed.

See, for example, One World: The Inter action of Science and Theology (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1986), 92-3; and Science and Creation: the Search for Understanding (Bos ton: Shambhala Publications, 1989), 36-7, and 71.</page><page sequence="19">THE DESCENT OF SCIENCE 853 A question remains, however. How is it possible that a life de voted to reason should fall prey to reductionist unreason? Why do the rigors of scientific inquiry not always inoculate a scientist against an opinion so manifestly at odds with his own most cherished activity? What would cause a man engaged in a rational search for the origins of human life to neglect to give due consideration to the properly hu man origins of that search?41 There is every reason to suspect that an 40 It is true that Wilson frequently hedges his most aggressively reduc tionistic claims with statements so unexceptionable as to border on the ba nal, as several reviewers of Consilience seem to have noticed. See John Du pre, "Unification not Proved," Science, May 29, 1998, 1345; and Jeremy Bernstein, "E. O. Wilson's Theory of Everything," Commentary, June 1998, 62-5. Some, moved by an understandable desire to defend an eminent scien tist against the charge of logical inconsistency, might point to such state ments as proof that Wilson is not, in truth, a reductionist after all. The cost of such a defense must be the admission that he is guilty of using language with reckless imprecision, which is rather a high price to pay, considering how un becoming is loose talk from one who looks to the precision available through science as proof of its superiority to prescientific reasoning; Consilience, 45 9. That Wilson often pairs his most startling claims with much more moder ate ones may well signal his awareness, at some level, that he cannot really commit himself to all that he claims. In his review essay of the book, Tzetven Todorov ("The Surrender to Nature," The New Republic, April 27, 1998, 29 33) goes so far as to suggest that Wilson "writes, a little cunningly, on two lev els." Todorov conjectures that Wilson's more "sensational" utterances are "designed for the newspapers," while his more "prudent" formulations enable him "to respond to objections by retorting 'But that is exactly what I'm say ing!'" Be that as it may, that Consilience does not always conform to the standards it sets for itself surely confirms that reductionism is so fundamen tally incoherent that it ultimately resists even verbal formulation. 41 Robert Sokolowski notes that "there is something unsatisfying about [the argument by retorsion]. It shows that our interlocutor has to concede something, but it does not explain why. . . . Furthermore, if our interlocutor is truly insistent, he will gladly concede that he is contradicting himself, and will say that such contradiction is part of the human condition"; "Formal and Material Causality in Science," Proceedings of the American Catholic Philo sophical Association. Supplement to the American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly 69 (1995), 63. It is true that the argument leaves unexplained the phenomena the reductionist attempted, unsuccessfully, to account for. It is also distinctly possible that when found out a thoroughgoing reductionist will sooner exult in his self-contradiction than blush because of it, so long at least as his reputation is left intact. As I have indicated, however, the irreducibility of intelligence to its subrational origins may not in the end be susceptible, quoad nos, to an adequate explanation. Furthermore, the argument by retor sion is in part experienced as "unsatisfying" partly because it is so obvious: we naturally find it rather baffling that an otherwise rational person should commit such a gaffe. This suggests, however, that phenomenology must strive not only to make visible the being of things in their truthfulness, but also to provide some account of the strange persistence of falsehood within truth. The wisdom to which philosophy aspires begins and ends in knowl edge of ignorance.</page><page sequence="20">854 JOHN C. MCCARTHY answer to this question would involve a long and demanding investi gation. Indeed, it is doubtful whether the question could be answered adequately in the absence of a comprehensive account of origins, hu man or otherwise. Here I should like merely to suggest one element of the problem. Although the desire to know is surely the characteristically hu man desire, nothing could be more human, and more ordinary, than the experience of less ascetical inclinations. While many a human lapse can be attributed to intellectual limitations of one sort or an other?lack of time, talent, or training?error and confusion often arise owing to some defect of the will. Thus, it sometimes happens that we speak falsely or incoherently because we desire that the truth be obscured. Moreover, this need not be a fully conscious or deliber ate affair; our words may mislead or bewilder quite apart from any ex press intention to mislead others, as occurs when we have been de ceived by our own appetites, appetites that compromise or distort but do not altogether eclipse our desire for the truth. There is surely nothing unusual about this. If mixed motives are a common affair, then mixed messages are the understandable result.42 Indeed, an un alloyed appetite for the truth, a willingness to embrace reality what ever the cost to us, is a thing rarely if ever seen among us. What we might broadly call moral considerations therefore provide a plausible, if also surely partial, explanation for the reductionist's inconsisten cies. Note that in proposing to explain the confusion he both sows and suffers by introducing such considerations, we do not ourselves necessarily succumb to the same affliction. We are not suggesting that the reductionist's assertions be treated as symptoms of subhu man causes. To the contrary, we are locating a properly human real ity?self-contradiction?within a properly human horizon?the com plexity of the human heart. The rhetorical elements often at work in a reductionist's speech flavor this hypothesis. One might have expected a representative specimen of the breed to keep a stern and steadfast silence. Having understood that subhuman principles govern all things, and deduced 42 The desire to deceive is always attended by some presence, however faint, of the desire to know the truth. In the words of St. Augustine, "I have known many men who would like to deceive, but none who wants to be de ceived;" Confessions, trans. John K. Ryan (Garden City, N.Y.: Image Books, 1960), 10.33.24, 252.</page><page sequence="21">THE DESCENT OF SCIENCE 855 that talk of any sort must be superfluous to such principles and their workings, why should he bestir himself to say anything at all? If, how ever, there were some form of address fully consistent with his grim science, it would surely be the monotonous drone. Tout comprendre, tout accepter should be his motto. Wilson's readers must be relieved that he does not drone, but the attentive among them will also be puz zled by his moralizing, evident in the urgent plea for the environment that concludes Consilience, to which I have already alluded. While we can admire his passion to make the world a better, more rational, place, we must also recognize that moralism is nowhere more out of place than in the world as he describes it.43 The reductionist's efforts to appeal to what is best in us strongly suggest that his inquiry is more dependent upon the terms of ordinary human existence than he is given to admit. None of this captures the specific appeal of reductionism, how ever. At this juncture, critics will often point to its simplicity. As Marxism is to political life, so reductionism is to the cosmos: ever ready to explain bothersome complexities away. True enough, per haps, but the thought is itself a little too simple to explain very much. For it is doubtful whether a man such as Wilson, who has spent many years of his life in exacting studies of the ant family, would have em braced reductionism owing to misguided idealism, intellectual sloth, a zealot's impatience, or a tyrant's ambition.44 The author of Consilience is well aware that "nature" names a domain of extraordi nary complexity; but as he rightly reminds us, science necessarily as pires to the simplicity afforded by a unified account of the whole. Nor is this aspiration merely a fond hope. As he also reminds us, modern science has disclosed a great many points of hidden continuity be tween apparently diverse realities.45 This points, I believe, to the most powerful and enduring source of reductionism's charm: the order and beauty to be discovered in nature, and the appeal that this naturally 43 For numerous helpful remarks regarding the inconsistencies plaguing reductionism as a rhetorical performance, see David Stove, Darwinian Fairytales (Aldershot, England: Avebury and Ashgate Publishing Company, 1995). Also useful in this regard is Mary Midgley's Evolution as a Religion Strange Hopes and Stranger Fears (New York: Methuen, 1985). ^Compare Consilience, 55-6, 68-71. 45 Consilience, 45-65.</page><page sequence="22">856 JOHN C. MCCARTHY holds for the human mind. Gazing upon the universe, it is not difficult to lose ourselves in self-forgetful contemplation.46 Wilson's very diligence as an entomologist suggests a second pos sible motive for his reductionism. In his Apology to the city of Athens, Socrates reports a series of exchanges he had with "those reputed to be wise," namely, the city's statesmen, poets, and artisans. Notably, these last are the only ones expressly said by Socrates to possess real knowledge. He goes on to observe, however, that because the arti sans perform their own arts well, they believe themselves "wisest also in the other things, the greatest things." Knowledge, or rather, pride in their craft, led them to perpetrate the same mistake made by the statesmen and the poets. Supposing themselves wise when they were not, they made themselves almost invincibly ignorant about the depths of their ignorance.47 Wilson is surely much more than a techni cian; and the knowledge he possesses is of a very distinguished order. Nevertheless the forays he makes upon politics and the arts,48 to say nothing of other matters outside his customary ambit, are often clumsy, and never better than conventional, suggesting a man simi larly seduced by what has been called the "charm of competence."49 It 46 Tellingly, the first chapter of the book is entitled "The Ionian Enchant ment" (Consilience, 3-7). In that chapter, and subsequently, Wilson refers to the "idea of the unity of science" as an "epiphany," and even a "dream," one which "captured," indeed "enthralled" him; 3-4; and compare 14, 16, and 23. It is, to say the least, somewhat surprising that such an avid proponent of the Enlightenment (14-44) should be so quick to characterize science as the fruit of "enchantment." The admission is all the more remarkable given the dim view Wilson takes elsewhere about the cognitive value of "dreams," for which see 53, and 75-8.

Yet like the Athenian craftsmen, he is prone to impatience when he encoun ters philosophy in something approximating its Socratic mode, whose strange boast is to possess knowledge only of its ignorance; see Consilience, 11-12, 96,116,120-1, 208-9, 238-41, and 269. 49 Leo Strauss, "What is Political Philosophy?" in What is Political Phi losophy and Other Essays (1959; reprint, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1988), 40.</page><page sequence="23">THE DESCENT OF SCIENCE 857 is hard to avoid the conclusion that the scientific reductionist has been unduly emboldened by a little learning. Reductionists will often call attention to their sangfroid: not for them, they insist, are the consolations afforded by ordinary human be liefs.50 Now, apart from the fact that the falsity of a position cannot be derived infallibly from its power to console, it must be said that the re ductionist's doctrine, stern though it is, does more than a little to put the mind at ease. That must, after all, be the effect of a theory that would lay every serious question finally to rest. Recall, in comparison, the celebrated fragment 199 of Pascal's Pens?es, entitled "the dispro portion of man." The fragment provides ample indication as to why Pascal, Christian though he was, has never enjoyed a reputation for taking the easy way out. What Pascal means by man's "disproportion" is an obvious and irremediable lack of fit between our being as finite knowers and the universe in which we find ourselves. As he puts it, the human being is "a nothing compared to the infinite, a whole com pared to nothing, a middle point between nothing and everything [and therefore] infinitely removed from understanding the extremes." Al though we must necessarily look to nature in order to make sense of ourselves, and to ourselves, in order to make sense of nature, neither provides a wholly adequate vocabulary for the other. Those who claim to have discovered the ultimate "principles" of nature?whether they be "Platonists," or materialists, it matters not?rashly assume a harmony between the human being and the being of nature. Such thinkers fail to consider just how odd it is that there should be a being occupying one place in particular given to the desire to view the whole of reality from all perspectives at once. "What is man?" is a question, Pascal believes, that we are naturally given to ask, but without suffi cient support from nature ever to address to our satisfaction.51 Reduc tionism, in contrast, purports to offer an answer so thorough that it would utterly dissolve the question. So complete is the reconciliation it proposes between the human being and the natural whole that the 50 Consilience, 6, 33, 224-5, 232, 243-9, 257, 260-5, and 269. 51 Pens?es, ed.

MCCARTHY turbulence brought about by all past quandaries is seen to have been unnecessary.52 For this reason, reductionism holds an allure that ri vals "Buddhism" in its power to anaesthetize.53 A fourth, and darker, source for many modern forms of reduc tionism is antitheological ire. Wilson, gentleman that he is, first men tions the Christianity of his Baptist youth with a certain grudging re spect. Surely his feverish adolescent reading of the Bible "cover to cover, twice," left a lasting mark upon his soul: his use of the English language reveals his ongoing affection for the cadences of Biblical prose and poetry. If his depiction of Christian revelation as a form of "transcendentalism" indicates that his theological formation was in important respects rather impoverished, he surely does not go out of his way to offend what theologically minded readers he might chance upon. He does confess, nonetheless, to having "found it a wonderful feeling ... to be released from the confinement of fundamentalist reli gion," which, like every other religion known to him, is just as "harsh" to members of its own "tribe" as it is to its "rivals."54 Much more 52 See Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene, 2d ed. (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), 1: "Is there meaning to life? What are we for? What is man? After posing the last of these questions, the eminent zoologist G. G. Simpson put it thus: 'The point I want to make now is that all attempts to answer that question before 1859 [that is, the year The Origin of the Species was published] are worthless and that we will be better off if we ignore them completely"; and 267; also The Blind Watchmaker (Harlow, En gland: Longman Scientific &amp; Technical, 1986), ix. In endorsing Simpson's ad vice, Dawkins is not just saying that old answers to certain enduring ques tions were inadequate. He is saying that the questions themselves as originally posed were worthless, because cast in entirely the wrong terms. He is therefore also saying that after 1859, when the essential terms of ade quate answers became available, the old questions ceased to have any point. In this way, he succumbs to the fallacy of every reductionist, which is un thinkingly to assume that he already knows just what the phenomenon is whose origin he means genetically to explain. The reductionist?and surely Wilson is here one with Dawkins (see Consilience, 3-4,164,185-6, 297)?be gins with the supposition that the question "what is man?" is easy and that the difficult question is "how did he come to be?" or "what makes him tick?" Reductionism takes for granted that the real work of science is to provide ex planations, not descriptions. In this respect, as in the sorts of things it cred its as principles of explanation, it proves to be far more theologically, or rather mythologically inclined, than it lets on. Consider, for example, Dawkin's infamous "m?mes," The Selfish Gene, 192-201, endorsed with only minor qualifications by Wilson, Consilience, 136, together with Aristotle Parts of Animals 1.1.640al0-b30. 53 See Richard Dawkins, The Blind Watchmaker (Harlow, England: Longman Scientific &amp; Technical, 1986), 5-6, on the "intellectual fulfillment" of post-Darwinian atheism.

It would be difficult to surpass in crudity what Richard Dawkins asserts about religion generally, and Christian ity in particular. It is surely rather surprising that after three centuries of fuming, antireligious indignation has not yet spent itself, but the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science (Oxford University) supplies ample proof to the contrary. Consider the following: Faith is powerful enough to immunize people against all appeals to pity, to forgiveness, to decent human feelings. It even immunizes them against fear, if they honestly believe that a martyr's death will send them straight to heaven. What a weapon! Religious faith deserves a chapter to itself in the annals of war technology, on an even footing with the longbow, the war-horse, the tank, and the hydrogen bomb.55 One might have thought that in a Darwinian world, such a forceful bit of weaponry deserved our admiration, not scorn. Be that as it may, the reductionist's persistent inability to render with sympathy and ac curacy a position he evidently takes satisfaction in burying cannot help but suggest the substance of his own position was not achieved sine ira et studio. Among Pascal's most gifted and devoted readers was Tocqueville, whose analysis of the idea of modern democracy remains, nearly a century and a half after its publication, without equal. Tocqueville be gins the second volume of Democracy in America with a discussion of the "influence" of that idea on "intellectual movements" in America. Contrary to what one might have expected from this aristocrat by na ture and by birth, he does not suppose that modern democracy is alto gether hostile to the life of the mind. He holds, rather, that democratic sentiment is conducive to theorizing of a particular sort. As Toc queville observes, democratic man tends to see the whole reality after his own image; and therefore nature is thought to favor, over the long haul, "freedom" and "equality"; the modern democrat is quick to 55 The Selfish Gene, 330-1; and 192-3, 198-9; see also Daniel Dennett, Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995), 515-22, for essentially more of the same. Consil ience appears to adopt a more irenic tone. "To be fair .. . [r]eligious exclu sion and bigotry arise from tribalism, the belief in the innate superiority and special status of the in-group. Tribalism cannot be blamed on religion. The same causal sequence gave rise to totalitarianism"; Consilience, 244-5. So far as I am aware, however, Wilson nowhere concedes that science is also a "tribal" enterprise, much less that it evinces the "sectarianism" characteristic of every "tribe"; see Consilience, 7, 33, and 253-7.</page><page sequence="26">860 JOHN C. MCCARTHY discount the influence of individuals over the "destiny of the species," and looks instead for a "general reason" to explain historical events; he leans hopefully toward the "indefinite perfectibility" of the human race; while he has a keen interest in the practical "applications" of sci ence, the democratic man shows little regard for the glory of science pursued for its own sake; because "the idea of unity obsesses him," the democrat in America has little use for a creator ex nihilo, and pre fers to view the natural whole in pantheistic terms, notwithstanding his Puritan roots.56 Is it merely by happenstance that the reduction ism advocated by Consilience should accord so well with these typi cally democratic conceits?57 Lest someone object that such a charge is rankly ad hominem, and that Wilson is in fact quite critical of the excesses of modern egalitarianism, one might counter by observing, with Tocqueville, that "there is no philosopher in the world, howso ever great, who does not believe a million things on faith from oth ers."58 Hence, in pledging his allegiance to a reductionistic concep tion of science, Wilson effectively deprives himself of the means he might otherwise possess to appraise the present political order in properly political, or human terms, and thereby ascend from uncriti cal acceptance of democratic opinion to a more adequate understand ing of the zoon politikon.59 56De la d?mocratie en Am?rique, vol. 2, pt. 1, chaps. 3, 26-32; 20, 121-6; pt. 8, 52-4; 10, 62-71; and pt. 7, 50-1. 57 As we have seen, Wilson maintains a certain reverence for great art ists and scientists, but the chapter he devotes to the "social sciences" is ut terly beholden to generalities (Consilience, 181-209). For his progressivism, see 256, 273-7; for his religion of nature, see 265, 298; on his stance toward the possibility of science for its own sake, see below. Wilson's democratic sensibilities are particularly visible in his assertion, near the end of the work, that "[w]hat really matters to humanity, a primate species well adapted to Darwinian fundamentals in body and soul, are sex, family, work, security, personal expression, entertainment, and spiritual fulfillment?in no particu lar order"; Consilience, 268.

An obvious consequence of this denial is that the world comes to seem radically mutable. The possibility that reality is not subject to the limits of the old essentialists suggests a sixth source of reductionism's appeal: a novel kind of human practice, according to which the knowledge of how things came to be will yield unheralded power to transform nature to suit our purposes. The origin of this new conception of science can be traced back to Ren? Descartes, and be fore him, to Francis Bacon; and although Wilson provides only a glimpse of this history, his Consilience is perfectly explicit about the links between a science that bids to explain all things through their genesis, and the ambition of modern technology to "master" nature.60 This is not to say that he favors reductionism simply because it is use ful. While he is understandably proud of the contribution modern nat ural science has made to human well being, he also emphatically un derlines the quandaries and dangers to our humanity, and to the planet as a whole, that issue from modern scientific technology. This only confirms, however, that in his description of the human being, he swings in a typically modern way between two extremes. Thus, on the one hand, when Consilience depicts the human race as the object of scientific inquiry, it appears as the passive subject of nature's immuta ble laws. On the other hand, when its author pauses to consider the human being as the possessor of science, he steps forth as nature's sovereign, able to destroy the planet, or to save it.61 The Titanism of reductionism, which makes man responsible for almost everything but himself, is surely very seductive. This brings me to the last aspect of reduction's appeal I shall men tion here. In the opening chapter of Consilience, Wilson is perfectly explicit about the motive animating his own attempt to offer a homo geneous science of the whole: "the moral imperative of humanism," whose goodness is said to consist in "the endeavor alone, whether 60 Consilience, 22-9.

MCCARTHY successful or not, provided the effort is honorable and failure memo rable." To elucidate this obscure precept, he appeals to the myth of Icarus, whose high-flying he takes to exemplify not foolish pride, but "a saving human grace." There is something very reassuring about Wilson's appeal to such "grace." However much a man may strive to deny all essential distinctions, and therewith, the distinctiveness of his own humanity, his nature will in the end seek somehow to reassert itself. Wilson's moral imperative also reassures us by its familiarity, for we are, in fact, the heirs of several centuries of such talk.62 None theless, in justifying his ambition in these terms, he reveals how prob lematic it is, for this "humanism" amount to a tacit denial that the truth is worth seeking because the truth itself is good. In effect, Wil son instrumentaiizes the truth; he makes it merely an index of human greatness; it is to be sought not because it is the truth, but because he and other high-flyers seek it. On this basis, he is only being consistent when he allows that "memorable failure"?which in the present con text can only mean some powerful falsehood?will do just as well. If we are to take him at his word, therefore, extravagant mistakes are more honorable than small but genuine advances toward the truth.63 Despite Wilson's deepest intentions, or because of them, he hereby confirms the essential falsity of his reductionism. By conceding that he does not believe that the truth is good sheerly because it is the truth, he admits that his science does not really intend before all else 62 Consilience, 7, 299; see also 248. For the origin of this use of the Icarus myth, Wilson directs us to Sir Arthur Eddington, by way of Edding ton's friend Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. Wilson's retelling of the myth is not exactly Eddington's, however, for which see Chandrasekhar's citation of the relevant passage from Eddington in the work cited by Wilson, Edding ton: the Most Distinguished Astrophysicist of His Time (Cambridge: Cam bridge University Press, 1983), 59. Wilson also fails to mention that Edding ton expressly rejected a reductionist conception of science. In a passage from Science and the Unseen World (New York: Macmillan, 1929) cited by Chandrassekhar, Eddington observes that one can no more aptly describe the human person in terms of the universal laws of physics than one can "ex tract the square root of a sonnet." Or as Eddington puts it on the following page of the text just cited, "[t]o those who have any intimate acquaintance with the laws of chemistry and physics the suggestion that the spiritual world could be ruled by laws of allied character is as preposterous as the suggestion that a nation could be ruled by laws like the laws of grammar." We are therefore not surprised when, a few pages further on, Eddington out lines the essentials of the argument by retorsion against reductionism, and concludes that "he would be a very shallow materialist who has not appreci ated the difficulty and persuaded himself that he has found an answer to it"; Science and the Unseen World, 53 (not 33, as Chandrasekhar reports), 54, and 60.</page><page sequence="29">THE DESCENT OF SCIENCE 863 to be good, that is to say, truthful science. The reductionist's self abasement is almost wholly in the service of his self-glorification.64 V There can be little doubt, I think, that Wilson's account of the na ture of natural science is seriously at odds with itself. In view of the manifestly self-contradictory character of his reductionism, I have provided some provisional suggestions that might help to explain how such a blunder could have escaped the notice of a scientist of his stat ure. Someone might concede all of this, yet still object that Wilson's error is his alone, an odd aberration, and therefore of little real inter est, scientific or otherwise. The objection is misplaced, and on several counts.65 63 Hence Consilience, 56: "there is no feeling more pleasant, no drug more addictive, than setting foot on virgin soil [that is, being the first to make an "important discovery"]"; see also 100. It appears, however, that such an achievement is not quite so absorbing and self-sufficient as Wilson initially claims, insofar as he also insists that scientists "deserve recognition" for their discoveries; 115. That Wilson is not fully unaware of the implications of his "moral imperative" becomes clear from his eagerness to cite Einstein, to a very different effect; 57. 64 On this point one should consult Augustine Confessions 12.34.25, who describes a more fundamental version of the same error. A valuable discus sion of this passage, and the issues it raises, is provided by Francis Slade, in his essay uWas ist Aufkl?rung? Notes on Maritain, Rorty, and Bloom. With Thanks, but No Apologies, to Immanuel Kant," to appear in The Common Things: Essays on Thomism and Education, ed. Daniel Mclnerny (Washing ton, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press, 1999), 48-68. 65 Pierre Manent has recently voiced a valuable, but somewhat different criticism, namely, that whatever its merits as regards modern science, the standard argument against reductionism does not really join the issue of modern philosophy. As he notes, despite the obvious force of the argument it had "no effect at ail on the development of modern thought.. . . The 'reduc tionist' movement only spread and penetrated more and more varied do mains, ensconcing itself with a growing force and soon with a total sover eignty in the life and viewpoints of modern man." Manent rightly observes that what governs the teaching of such thinkers as Locke is not so much re ductionism, as a new form of human practice guided by a new form of theory. On the basis of a "critique of reason" purporting to establish that man's "es sence" can never be known, Locke and other hope thereby to clear the way from above for a form of political and moral life neutral to, which is to say un hindered by the old modern thinkers essentialist disputes; The City of Man, trans. Marc A. LePain (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1998), 127-9. Manent is surely on solid ground in calling attention to the self-conscious generosity motivating thinkers suh as Locke; nevertheless Pascal's counter still obtains: "L'homme n'est ni ange ni b?te, et le malheur veut que qui veut faire l'ange fait le b?te"; Lafuma 678, Brunschvicg 358.</page><page sequence="30">864 JOHN C. MCCARTHY The task of mediating the achievements of modern natural sci ence to interested members of the reading public is not merely inci dental to science. As Wilson appears to be aware, the pursuit of sci ence cannot occur in a vacuum: as one human activity among many, it is reliant in important ways upon the public's perception of it. By it self a fat research grant no more suffices to explain a successful sci entist than Darwinian selection can account for the human desire to know still modern scientific inquiry must look to the public coffers for its continuance.66 At a deeper level, science will continue to flourish only if each succeeding generation succeeds in generating a sufficient number of young people sufficiently able and interested to carry on its work; despite its record of "progress" to date, it is certainly not as sured by its impressive past of an ever more prolific future; scientists are a breed whose scientific formation can easily be corrupted by public antipathy to rational inquiry; Wilson is therefore quite right to be concerned about recent signs of irrationalism in the academy, even if he does not appreciate just how rooted is the "deconstructionism" he condemns in the Enlightenment rationalism he applauds.67 In short, for reasons of self-preservation alone, the scientific community ought to take a much more serious interest than it does at present in efforts such as his to mediate its achievements to a wider audience. Because popularized presentations of natural science are necessary for the health of science, it is not a minor matter when such presenta tions do manifest violence to the properly human origins of science. Even if natural science did not need to make some provision for its future, however, as perhaps the most powerful modern embodi ment of the life of the mind it ought still to be concerned about the ir rationality of reductionism. Almost despite himself, Wilson provides at least a partial explanation as to why his confreres have not been more critical of him. For in the context of his insistence that science is required by its very nature to seek a comprehensive and integrated understanding of the natural whole, he laments the present fragmen tation of scientific inquiry. Since most working scientists lack either the inclination, the ability, or the leisure to set their sights higher, spe cialization and its attendant narrowness is, perhaps, unavoidable. Yet again to his credit, Wilson refuses to allow present necessities to die 66 Consilience, 38-40, 93, and 181-2. 67 Consilience, 40-4, and 214-16.</page><page sequence="31">THE DESCENT OF SCIENCE 865 t?te to science what science ought to be.68 If his own efforts at articu lating a "metaphysics" are quite unsatisfactory, still his dissatisfaction with a piecemeal conception of the life of the mind is perfectly in con formity with the demands of a genuine science of origins. I do not say that modern natural science is inevitably reductionis tic, which would be to perpetrate a reductionism of another sort. However, it could be shown, I believe, that once science is thought to possess a single "method" appropriate to the investigation of all things, once, that is, it ceases to take its orientation from the kind character of the world, as with Aristotle, and concerns itself solely with "species-neutral principles," principles that cut across the kinds, science becomes extremely vulnerable to reductionist incoherence.69 On the other hand, the difficulties confronting anyone who would at tempt a nonreductionistic science of the whole indicate that Wilson's failure is, in a sense, neither surprising, nor in its essentials terribly new. Whatever the appeal of reductionism to our all too human incli nations?and its charms are surely considerable?we must in the end concede that it finds some, albeit ambiguous, support in the knowl edge we have about reality, and in the ignorance that lies beneath and beyond that knowledge. In the words of Leo Strauss, The knowledge which we possess is characterized by a fundamental du alism which has never been overcome. At one pole we find knowledge of homogeneity: above all in arithmetic, but also in the other branches of mathematics, and derivatively in all productive arts or crafts. At the opposite pole we find knowledge of heterogeneity, and in particular of heterogeneous ends ... Included among our knowledge of heterogeneity is surely the aware ness informing our desire to know, and especially, our desire to know what is first and ultimate. Such knowledge seems to light up the way to our knowledge of everything else by displaying the goodness of the truth. However, Strauss continues, It seems that knowledge of the whole would have to combine somehow ... knowledge [of ends, and above all, knowledge of the ends of human 68 Consilience, 38-40. 69 For a most helpful introduction to this and related issues, see Richard F. Hassing's "Introduction" (along with the essays introduced by it), in Final Causality in Nature and in Human Affairs, ed. Richard F.

And this combination is not at our disposal. Men are therefore constantly tempted to force the issue by imposing unity on the phenomena, by absolutizing either knowledge of homogeneity or knowledge of ends.70 The inconsistencies plaguing E. O. Wilson's reductionistic under standing of the nature of things represent a perennial human possibil ity. As such, Consilience has the very great merit, whatever its ratio nal shortcomings, of displaying the force of a question that must always be raised, implicitly or explicitly, before and after we make any attempt to pose the question about the origins of intelligent hu man life, namely, what is man?
