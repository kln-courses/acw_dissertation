<plain_text><page sequence="1">The planting of sustenance Symbolism of the Two-Horned God in offerings from the Templo Mayor DEBRA NAGAO Recent excavations in the center of downtown Mexico City have uncovered large quantities of treasures. These were deliberately buried in the pyramidal body of the Templo Mayor, the religious and political focus of the largest empire in pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica under the fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Mexica Aztecs. Economically and symbolically valuable materials, including greenstone, flint, and shell, were probably interred by the Mexica as ritual offerings or sacrifices to the gods (as noted by sixteenth-century Spanish chroniclers, for example, Duran 1967 I: 81 ff.; II: 228). Of the approximately one hundred offerings that have been unearthed, some contained only a few objects, whereas others were accumulations of hundreds of artifacts.1 This study will focus on the latter group ? apparently the richest, most elaborate offerings from the Mexica capital of Tenochtitlan. The most characteristic feature of these caches is a simple, highly standardized sculpture of a seated male, who wears a headdress with two protuberances or "horns." The ideptity of the figure represented by this sculpture is still unclear, despite the many iconographie studies concerned with the iden tification of deities in codices and sculptures since the turn of the century. In light of the wealth of materials and information yielded by the recent excavations, which provide a unique opportunity to study Aztec monuments within an archaeological context, the following essay will reassess the problem of the identification of the image and will examine its significance in Mexica caches and society. Traditionally, the primary means of identifying Aztec deities in art was based on comparisons of selected traits with Mixtee or Aztec codices, with descriptions drawn from the writings of early Spanish chroniclers and with previously identified sculptures. The pieces of evidence from these diverse sources were combined and assembled as if all were parts of the same puzzle. Figure 1. Two-Horned God sculpture from Offering 7, Templo Mayor. Nagao photograph; courtesy Instituto Nacional de Antropolog?a e Historia, M?xico. Recent information shows, however, that the symbolic system of the Aztecs was not so monolithic (Pasztory 1983; in press). That is to say, certain deities appearing in monumental sculptures lack parallels in codex illustrations, while many more deities are described in texts than appear in separate ?mages (Pasztory, in press). 1.

Back view of the Two-Horned God sculpture from Offering 7, Templo Mayor. Nagao photograph; courtesy INAH, Mexico. Different sources (art monuments, archaeology, ethnohistorical texts, and codices) provide different types of information and thus do not always tell the same story. Textual sources, such as native-style pictorial codices and Spanish chronicles, remain curiously silent with regard to this sculpture and its interment. Therefore, in the present discussion the primary sources of information are limited to the sculpture itself and its archaeological context; ethnohistorical accounts are secondary. The earliest recorded excavations of images bearing the distinctive Two-Horned headdress were made in 1900 along Escalerillas Street (now known as Guatemala Street) in Mexico City (Batres 1902: 25, 28, 30).2 Other Two-Horned idols were subsequently found in the 1930s (Noguera 1968: 149-150), in the 1940s (Estrada Balmori 1979: 183ff.), and in the 1960s (?ngulo 1966b; Contreras 1979). In excavations undertaken by the Mexican National Institute of Anthropology and History from 1978 to 1982, thirteen sculptures with the Two Horned headdress were found buried in the body of the Templo Mayor alone, and two were found in areas nearby within the Ceremonial Precinct (Matos, personal communication, 1985). Generally deposited in small, stone-lined chambers, the sculpture was often accompanied by stone Tlaloc (rain god) vessels; flint knives; shells; animal remains; obsidian blades and polished miniature objects; greenstone beads, masks, and figurines; and other lapidary miniatures and deity insignia. Other examples of the sculpture, not from recorded excavations, are known from numerous museum collections, such as the Museum f?r V?lkerkunde in Basel (no. IVb 649, acquired ca. 1844), the American Museum of Natural History (no 62.03), the Metropolitan Museum of Art (no. 00.5.97), and the Museum of the American Indian (nos. 5592 and 5738). Clearly, the sculpture with the Two-Horned headdress represents a deity rather than a man. In Aztec imagery, insignia and costume traits functioned as visual metaphors signifying the powers of the deity represented. Thus, an adorned idol, a human impersonator, and anything bearing the insignia of the god were transformed into the god itself.3 Both headdress and handheld objects were key traits that served to identify the deity represented. The uniformity and complexity of the headdress of the sculpture repeatedly buried in Templo Mayor offerings indicate without a doubt that a deity is represented. This sculpture will hereafter be referred to as the Two Horned God. Before proceeding, however, a few introductory remarks are necessary in order to fully apprehend the significance of Mexica caches, and this sculpture specifically. In certain respects, Mexica buried offerings continue votive practices that were traditional for centuries in Mesoamerica; however, in certain aspects of contents and locations, Mexica offerings are unique (Nagao, in press). The most distinctive aspects relevant to the present discussion are the appearance of a standardized, unmutilated stone sculpture in buried offerings and the concentration of these deposits at 2. The area investigated by Batres may have been part of a late epoch of the southwest corner of the Templo Mayor or the area directly in front of the Temple. 3. This concept has been discussed in greater detail by Hvidtfeldt (1958) and Townsend (1979: 23ff.).</page><page sequence="3">Nagao: The planting of sustenance 7 Figure 3 (left).

Coe 1968: 85-86), the Maya (Coggins 1975 I: 182, 188,263,281; Marquina 1964: 892), the inhabitants of Xochicalco (Saenz 1962a: 69-70), and the Toltecs (Acosta 1942-1944: 135; 1945: 37-38) were known to have buried stone monuments, these sculptures were generally mutilated or symbolically killed prior to interment. Caches containing greenstone or other stone figurines were interred at Teotihuacan (Rub?n de la Borbolla 1947: 67), Xochicalco (Saenz 1961; 1962b: 51; 1963: 12), and Maya sites (W. Coe 1962: 498; 1959: 82). These figurines were also frequently made of some material that was inherently precious or valuable, and therefore worth hoarding. They do not show the extent of iconographie unity of the Two-Horned God sculptures, however. The phenomenon of the burial of a sculpture representing a specific deity emerges as a distinctively Mexica practice. Following this brief survey, we return to the sculpture depicting the figure with the Two-Horned headdress. The rest of this paper will deal with a general description of the sculpture's characteristic traits and variants, followed by a summary of previous identifications. A fairly detailed reassessment of the Two-Horned God's pose and insignia leads to a reinterprefation of the figure. The ultimate significance of the ritual burial of the sculpture and the particular relationship between the Two-Horned God and the Templo Mayor will then be explored in an attempt to answer such questions as: Why was the Two-Horned God buried? Why was he buried so frequently in the Templo Mayor? Traits and variants of the Two-Horned God The characteristics of the sculpture frequently found buried in Templo Mayor caches are simple and standardized (figs. 1-8). Generally measuring between 30 to 38 cm in height, the figure is seated with knees drawn up to chest and arms crossed over knees. His costume consists solely of a headdress, plain loincloth, and ear ornaments. Most distinctive is the headdress with its two rectangular "horns" projecting from the crown of the head; its headband decorated with circles flanking a central J-shaped curl over the forehead; its triangular-shaped slabs projecting from the nape of the neck; and its long rectangular panel hanging down the figure's back with two notched ovals resembling eggs or bow ties in high or low relief respectively. The ear ornaments are formed by a square with a long pendant from the center.

Two teeth protrude from beneath the upper lip at the corners of the mouth. Only a few sculptures deviate slightly from this formula. Some are made of precious materials; others are very finely carved, more elaborate versions. The white stone Two-Horned God from the Templo Mayor Room 2 cache shows minor variations in pose, plain disk earplugs, and undecorated headband (figs. 7, 8). Noteworthy is the articulation of the two rectangular "horns" as faceted knobs with pendant tassels. Also, the triangular nape piece is clearly carved as a pleated fan. On the figure's back are detailed, as opposed to schematic, representations of turtle carapaces. A similarly articulated headdress is worn by a well-known stone sculpture from the Museum f?r V?lkerkunde in Basel (figs. 9, 10). In addition, the central curl on the headband is transformed into a serpentine head with curled snout, the turtle carapace on the back is attached to a braided panel, and the figure sports a beard, sandals, and leg ornaments. It is generally agreed that these two variants represent the same individual as the standardized version discussed above.4 Previous interpretations Despite the standardization of this sculpture's form, the relative simplicity of its parts and the lack of a visual counterpart in codex imagery have made identification a matter of speculation of the century. Eduard Seier, a pioneer in the field of Pre-Columbian studies, at the turn of the century, was the first to attempt to identify this figure (Seler 1960a: 849-853). He describes the small Two-Horned idols as "mountain gods" (Bergg?ttern) 4. Another well-known sculpture found in the Pino Suarez Metro Station in Mexico City shares some of the traits of the Two-Homed God sculpture (Heyden 1970). However, it differs in several respects ? "horns" carved with low-relief feathers, plain disk headband, plain back panel, rubber-spattered loincloth, blue body paint, flat base on which the sculpture rests ? suggesting that a different supernatural may have been represented.

Positive evidence for his theory are the triangular nape projections, representing the pleated paper fan attachment characteristic of mountain, water, and rain gods. However, his interpretation of the "horns" as mountain peaks and of the accompanying greenstone beads and figurines as appropriate and favored offerings for mountain gods adds little concrete support to this identification. In the tradition of Seler, but with very different results, Hans Dietschy (1941) discusses the Two-Horned God in the Basel Museum f?r V?lkerkunde (figs. 9, 10). He identifies this sculpture as a fusion of Quetzalcoatl, as moon god and culture bearer, combined with Tonacatecuhtli, the supreme Lord of Sustenance. Dietschy links details of the sculpture's insignia with a variety of different deities as depicted in pre-Hispanic pictorial documents and with descriptions from Aztec mythology. The majority of traits relate to Tonacatecuhtli and Quetzalcoatl, which leads Dietschy to assume that the two deities are related. He makes no attempt to explain this hypothesized fusion, however. Other scholars have identified the Two-Horned God as Tepeyollotl, a nocturnal, terrestrial aspect of the omnipotent Tezcatlipoca (Estrada Balmori 1979; Mateos Higuera 1979; Nicholson and Keber 1983; Seler in Nicholson and Keber 1983: 88). Focusing on the Basel sculpture, Nicholson offers the most explicit discussion of this theory, which is based on costume details, etymological interpretation, and general archaeological context. The Two-Horned God sculpture resembles the anthropomorphic form of Tepeyollotl in some codices in several respects: the two "horns," identified as Tepeyollotl's puffed pads of hair; the triangular nape attachment; and sometimes the beard (fig. 11a-c). The turtle shells carved on the head or back of the Two Horned God are considered earth symbols, said to reinforce Tepeyollotl's terrestrial associations. Tepeyollotl's name means "Mountain Heart," which according to Nicholson is why Tepeyollotl may have been buried as the symbolic "heart" of the cache (Nicholson and Keber 1983: 88).5 But the particular relationship between the Two-Horned God and the Templo Mayor, the predominant location of Two Horned God caches, is not explored. The most recent and perhaps most popular interpretation of the Two-Horned God sculpture has been as Xiuhtecuhtli, the god of fire and rulership (Castillo and Solis 1975; Matos 1980, 1982; Wagner 1982). This identification is also based on a comparison between the sculpture's insignia and sixteenth-century pictorial documents. Traits associated with Xiuhtecuhtli in codices include the nape projections, the two "horns" representing fire drills, and the jewelled headband with central curl signifying supreme status 5. This interpretation implies that the Two-Horned God was not the focus of the cache, but of secondary importance. This does not explain the peculiar coincidence of the richest offerings in association with the Two-Horned God, however. Figure 11.a. Tepeyollotl, Codex Borgia 14 (after Seler 1963). b. Tepeyollotl, Codex Telleriano-Remensis (after Corona N??ez 1964 I: Part 2, l?m. 3). c.

The turtle on the Two Horned God's back is again considered an earth symbol, carved perhaps as a reference to Xiuhtecuhtli's home in the "navel of the earth" (Sahag?n 1969 Book 6: 19, 88).6 The burial of Xiuhtecuhtli in Templo Mayor caches has been explained as part of a structuralist dialectic between water and fire, fertility and warfare, and agricultural produce and tribute, expressed in the symbolism of the Templo Mayor as a whole (Matos 1978, 1980). Thus the presence of Xiuhtecuhtli is considered a natural balance for the abundance of images of Tlaloc, god of rain, at the Templo Mayor. The duality in the symbolism of the Templo Mayor cannot be denied; however, the pervasiveness of such dualism as an overriding template on all levels of Aztec thought and perception is perhaps overstated. The presence of the Two-Horned God within caches and specifically at the Templo Mayor may have had a more specific and complex meaning. Previous interpretations have been based primarily on a selective analysis of the sculpture's insignia compared with pictorial manuscripts. Despite this fundamental similarity in method, the resulting conclusions have been quite different, ranging from mountain god or "Mountain Heart" (Tepeyollotl) to fire god (Xiuhtecuhtli) or moon god-culture bearer (Quetzalcoatl) fused with Lord of Sustenance (Tonacatecuhtli). One major problem resides in the fact that not one of these analyses has systematically assessed all of the Two-Horned God's characteristics and variants. Furthermore, the archaeological context of the sculpture has only been superficially treated, and no one has yet examined the question of the ultimate significance of the burial of this figure with such lavish offerings in the Templo Mayor. Reassessment of the traits of the Two-Horned God The salient characteristics of the Two-Horned God can be broken down into five categories: pose, headdress, ear ornament, teeth, and facial paint. (Since the only garment worn on the body is a simple loincloth, typical for Aztec males, this will not be considered as a distinctive trait.) Each of these five aspects of the sculpture will be considered to determine the identity of the figure. I"-.-- ''t Figure 12. Xiuhtecuhtli, Codex Borbonicus 20. Courtesy Akademische Druck-u. Verlagsanstalt, Graz. The position of anthropomorphic sculpture often defined the gender of the image among the Aztecs. Certain poses were reserved for males and others for females (Pasztory 1983: 210; Sol?s Olguin 1982). The seated posture of the Two-Horned God occurs in two variants. Most representations show the figure with knees drawn up to chest, arms crossed, and elbows resting on knees (figs. 1, 3, 4, 9). In Aztec sculpture, this pose is typical for seated males. Occasionally, a variant appears (fig. 7). In the latter example, the figure appears to be crouching with knees drawn up to chest, but with hands clasping knees. This pose occurs sporadically, but it is unclear whether it has a specific significance. It is seen in a greenstone figurine with the date 8 Reed, in the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City, that has been identified as Quetzalcoatl; in the wooden "Xolotl" in the Museum f?r V?lkerkunde in Vienna; in the greenstone birth-giving "Tlazolteotl" (the authenticity of which has been questioned) and birth-giving rabbit, both at Dumbarton Oaks in 6. The turtle shell might also allude to the fire serpent back device worn by Xiuhtecuhtli. Mixtee genealogical manuscripts often depict fire serpents with turtle carapace bodies. This creature is shown in the act of performing a sacrifice and is also associated with rulership and the origins of the Mixtee pantheon (Smith 1973: 60-64).</page><page sequence="8">12 RES 10 AUTUMN 85 Figure 13. Tonacatecuhtli, Codex Borgia 61. Courtesy Akademische Druck-u. Verlagsanstalt, Graz. Washington, D.C; and in a few stone sculptures of seated males (see, for example, Sol?s Olguin 1982: 1. LXXXIIb). Perhaps this latter pose is simply a variant of the standard male posture; however, three of the above mentioned sculptures are seen with smaller figures emerging from the lower part of the body, suggesting that perhaps the pose may allude to parturition or bisexuality.7 Similar ambiguity is found in the Codex Borgia representation of Tonacatecuhtli, shown in a splayed position suggestive of giving birth (fig. 13). The headdress of a sculpture is perhaps the most significant trait in determining the identity of the deity (Pasztory 1983: 217). The headdress of the Two-Horned God consists of four parts: (1) the two "horns," (2) the panel hanging down the figure's back, (3) the headband, and (4) the triangular attachments at the nape of the neck. The two "horns" are represented as slightly tapering, trapezoidal projections or as rounded ovals with faceted surfaces and with tassel pendants. It is this latter treatment that has been identified either as an ear of corn or as a turtle carapace (figs. 7-10). Headdresses with maize are shown in pictorial documents and are associated with Tonacatecuhtli (Lord of Sustenance; figs. 14, 15) and Centeotl (god of maize, "Sacred Stalk of Dried Maize"; fig. 16). The depiction of a turtle shell is clearly sculpted on the panel hanging down the figure's back (figs. 8, 10). These appear in more schematic form as notched ovals (figs. 2, 5, 6). The significance of the turtle carapace will be discussed later. The tassel issuing from the faceted "horn" favors the maize interpretation; an intentional allusion to both maize and turtle may have been intended, however. The Aztecs esteemed complex and subtle metaphors (Sahag?n 1969 Book 6: 1, 11, 17, 25, 47, 105, 113, 151), a verbal aesthetic that can perhaps be applied to visual imagery as well. The concept of visual punning or metaphoric substitution is not a new idea (see Rowe 1977), and it is one that is particularly appropriate for Aztec imagery (Fern?ndez 1972: 120ff.; Pasztory 1983: 81-83). The striking resemblance between the representation of the turtle shell and the ear of corn and their probable juxtaposition in several sculptures suggests a deliberate attempt to equate the two forms. The two may have constituted both a visual and verbal pun on sustenance and turtle. 7. The three birth-giving figures are the following: (1) the "Tlazolteotl," which is clearly female; (2) the wooden Xolotl, which has male genitals (Nowotny 1949); and (3) the rabbit sculpture of indeterminate gender. Their respective "offspring" can be identified as human (perhaps male?), male (perhaps warrior?), and eagle-helmeted male warrior.</page><page sequence="9">Nagao: The planting of sustenance 13 Figure 14 (left).

The N?huatl word t?nac?y?tl means "human sustenance" or "fruits of the earth" (Molina 1970: 149) and often refers specifically to maize (Karttunen 1983: 245). T?nac?y?tl may have been heard as a* pun on "abundant turtle" (t?naca ?y?tl). The root of the word is t?na, which means "to shine" or "to heat," and is not nacatl or tonacay?, which mean "flesh" and "our flesh" respectively (Karttunen 1983: 245; Molina 1970: 149; Andrews 1975: 474). The suffixes -y?tl or -c?y?tl are added to nouns or verbs respectively to signify an abstract state or quality (Launey 1979: 286; Karttunen 1983: 339-340). The heat of the sun causes the earth to bring forth fruit in abundance, which is, by extension, sustenance; hence, the derivation of sustenance from heat (Launey 1979: 286). Vowel lengths support the hypothesis that "hot/abundant" (t?naca) "turtle" (?y?tl) may have sounded like t?nac?y?tl (Karttunen 1983: 16, 245). Considering the visual ambiguity in the depiction of corn and turtle, and the conceptual relationship between the two (discussed below), the possibility of an aural, visual, and symbolic relationship between turtle and sustenance appears plausible.8 The turtle shell, although sometimes contested in the identification of the "horns," is certainly depicted on the Two-Horned God's back panel. The significance of turtle carapaces in this context is a matter of speculation. Previous interpretations have emphasized the turtle as an earth symbol to support the identification of two quite different deities: Xiuhtecuhtli and Figure 16. Centeotl, Codex Bor bon i eu s 17. After Codex Bor bon i eu s 1975. 8. Such a playful verbal and visual nexus has been proposed for place names in the Codex Mendoza (Janice Robertson, personal communication, 1983). For example, the N?huatl word for "armadillo" is ayotochtli, a combination of ayotl (turtle) and tochtli (rabbit). Similarly, the place name for Ayotochco ("Place of the Armadillo") is visually represented by a creature resembling a rabbit with a turtle shell on its back and with a long tail {Codex Mendoza 53).</page><page sequence="10">14 RES 10 AUTUMN 85 Tepeyollotl. Turtle shells do not appear on the backs of other deities in sculpture, but they are found in pictorial codices on the backs of fructifying fertility goddesses, such as in the Codex Fej?rv?ry Mayer (fig. 1 7; Codex Fej?rv?ry Mayer 29; Spranz 1964: 316). Turtles were also associated with another female fertility deity, Ayopechtli ("Turtle Bed"), who was a mother goddess, patroness of birth (Sahag?n 1958: 130-133). The significance of the turtle shell back device is perhaps more complex than a simple allusion to the earth. In addition to its relationship with the fructifying and creative powers of female fertility deities, it may have been an important symbol of sustenance, based on the reproductive means of the turtle itself. Sahag?n described the mysterious birth of turtles as follows: "Thus does it bring forth its young: it lays its eggs on the sand; it buries them in the sand. In some way they go on to be hatched; they hatch. And when it is time to hatch, they are edible; they taste better than turkey eggs." He also says of the turtle, ". . . like the frog, it is edible, good-tasting, very good" (Sahag?n 1963 Book 11: 60, 59). The burial of the turtle's eggs and the subsequent birth of living, edible creatures forms a striking conceptual parallel with the act of the planting of agricultural sustenance, especially maize. This resemblance underscores the symbolic relationship between maize and turtles. The more abstract, rectangular protuberances have been identified by some scholars as the fire drills issuing from Xiuhtecuhtli's headdress in pictorial codices (fig. 12; Sol?s Olguin, personal communication, 1981). In two related postconquest pictorial manuscripts, the Codex Telleriano-Remensis and the Codex Vaticanus A, Tepeyollotl appears as a lord of the night with similar rectangular projections representing hair (fig. 11b-c).9 There is no particular indication in the sculpture that fire drills or hair were intended, however (figs. 1-6, cf. figs, 11, 12). Furthermore, it is unclear why turtle carapaces would replace hair or fire drills as depicted in both the Basel and white stone sculptures (figs. 7-10). The two rectangular projections do not look like anything in particular, and they are not elaborated in any way to permit identification. Their most distinguishing characteristic is their conspicuous presence. Perhaps their significance resides in their "twoness." Perhaps Figure 17. Fertility goddess, Codex Fej?rv?ry Mayer 29. After Seler 1901. they were not intended to represent anything in particular, but rather were meant to symbolize duality. The relationship among the Templo Mayor, the Two Horned God, and duality will be discussed later. The closest parallel to these rectangular protuberances are forms issuing from the head of sculptures identified as Xolotl. Examples are a wood sculpture in the Museum f?r V?lkerkunde in Vienna (Nowotny 1949), a fragmentary stone head (Batres 1902), and a complete stone head discovered during the Metro excavations (fig. 18; Gussinyer 1969). Initially identified as a jaguar head, the Metro sculpture was reinterpreted by Caso (1970) as Xolotl, based on the two rectangular projections from the top of the head, the bestial characteristics, and the Quetzalcoatl curved ear ornaments. The two abstract head bumps are identified as the torn-off dog ears of Xolotl, who is always depicted with both human and dog ears (Nowotny 1949). However, these two protuberances resemble mutilated dog ears as little as they recall hair puffs, fire drills, and mountain peaks (figs. 11, 12, 18, cf. figs. 1-6).10 Perhaps the significance of these protruding "horns" is related to the identity of Xolotl. Xolotl is the twin of 9. See Corona N??ez 1964a Part 2: l?ms. 1-3, 5-6,8-9, 11-17, 19-21, 23-25, 27-29, 31-33; and Corona N??ez 1964b: l?ms. 16-18, 20-21, 23-24, 26-28, 30-32, 34-35, 39, 41-42, 44-46, 48, 50, 52-54. 10. A relationship between these protuberances or "horns" and the typical Aztec female hairdo has also been suggested. However, while the Aztec female coiffure appears to consist of two bunches of hair swept up at the side (for example, Codex Mendoza; Codex Magliabechiano), the sculpture's "hair" or maize tassels appear to be swept back away from the face. This appears to be a significant difference.</page><page sequence="11">Nagao: The planting of sustenance 15 ^^^^_ ^BBK^^^S?iKf^"^'''' _?*ti'' - - '' "^fi^^H Figure 18. Head of Xolotl, Metro excavations, Mexico City. Photograph courtesy INAH, Mexico. Quetzalcoatl in the guise of the Morning Star (Seler 1963 I: 48, 143, 148; Caso 1970). He is considered the canine companion for the dead, the mover of the sun, and the deformed god of twins (Seler 1963 I: 29, 49, 148). Mythologically, Xolotl appears in an account of the creation of the cosmos recorded by Sahag?n (1953 Book 7: 7-8). Afraid to sacrifice himself in order to put the sun into motion, Xolotl flees to a maize field, where he takes the form of two young maize stalks growing from a single root. The myth continues as Xolotl flees and transforms himself into other flora and fauna. The double stalks of maize are of particular interest because they themselves are called xolotl (Sahag?n 1953 Book 7: 8). Perhaps these abstract rectangular projections of the sculpture symbolize xolotl, the double maize stalk graphically depicted on both the Basel and white stone Two-Horned God images (figs. 7-10). On the other hand, when these xolotl protuberances occur in the context of canine and Quetzalcoatl features, their presence perhaps alludes to both Xolotl as deity and as maize. The headband of the figure occurs in two variants. The most frequent is the band decorated with round jewels with curled projection in the center (figs. 1, 3, 4). In the Basel sculpture (fig. 9), this form appears as a creature often identified as a serpent, but it is unclear whether this was intended in all examples. The jewelled headband is generally associated with supreme deities, such as Xiuhtecuhtli, or solar deities, such as Tonatiuh, and may perhaps be identified as the chalchiutetelli, the royal headband with blue cotinga bird in the center as described by Sahag?n (Seler 1960b: 459). The second variant consists of a plain band with a twisted cord design at top and/or bottom (fig. 7). The twisted cord headband is often worn by fertility, vegetation, or water deities, such as Tlaloc (fig. 19). The last component of the headdress, the fan-shaped attachment at the nape of the neck, clearly represents the pleated paper attachment worn by fertility, water, and mountain deities (Soler 1960a: 850; Broda 1971 : 264). In most examples it is shown schematically as a flat, slablike projection (figs. 1-6). In more detailed versions of the Two-Horned God, however, this protruding slab is finely carved to imitate the folds of the pleated paper attachments (figs. 7-10). Like headdresses, ear ornaments often aid in identifying the deity represented. There are two ear ornament types that occur regularly. The most common consists of a square plaque with a long, single jewel pendant from the center (figs. 1,3,4, 9). This type of earplug is often worn by pulque gods (fig. 20) (Codex Figure 19. Polychromed pottery Tlaloc vessel, Offering 21, Templo Mayor. Photograph courtesy INAH, Mexico.</page><page sequence="12">16 RES 10 AUTUMN 85 o Figure 20. Pulque god, Codex Magliabechiano 53r. Courtesy Akademische Druck-u. Verlagsanstalt, Graz. Magliabechiano 49r-52r, 54r-57r, 59r, 85r)n or by gods associated with fertility and sustenance (fig. 19). The second type of ear ornament consists of a simple round disk (fig. 7). Whether this version has a particular meaning is unclear. Another important characteristic of representations of the Two-Horned God is the presence of two teeth. These protrude from beneath the upper lip and are clearly human and not the curled fangs of an animal or of the rain deity Tlaloc. In pictorial manuscripts, such teeth often indicate old age, and by extension, signify the exalted status of the ancients. Old deities, such as Xiuhtecuhtli and Tonacatecuhtli, are associated with such age and high status. The Basel sculpture includes a beard (fig. 9), a detail that also expresses old age.12 The last trait to be considered is face paint. In the few examples where pigment has survived on a sculpture, the Two-Horned God is shown with blue pigment covering most of the face, and the mouth area is covered with red paint. This is a problematical trait that has parallels only in late pictorial documents. The Borgia group codices and the Codex Borbonicus provide no parallels for this type of face paint. The Tonalamatl de Aubin (3-19) shows Tepeyollotl with similar red, brownish green, and yellow face paint, whereas the postconquest Cocfex Telleriano-Remensis and Cocfex Vaticanus A show Tepeyollotl with red and bluish green face paint.13 In native-style codices, Tepeyollotl is shown most frequently in symbolic form as a mountain or in zoomorphic form as a jaguar (for example, Codex Borbonicus). When Tepeyollotl is shown as a human, however, the face paint in the earlier sources (for example, Codex Borgia 14) is either all yellow or yellow and red. In Sahag?n's "Atav?os de los Dioses" there is no face paint that corresponds with the blue and red of the Two-Horned God (Seler 1960b). Pulque gods are said to have bicolored face paint, sometimes specified as red and black; Ayopechtli is the only deity described with blue face paint (Seler 1960b: 438, 494). Unfortunately, Tepeyollotl is not mentioned at all. In summary, it appears that two principal complexes are represented by the pose, headdress, ear ornaments, and teeth of the Two-Horned God. One relates to vegetation and fertility, and the other to supremacy and high status. The concepts of sustenance and vegetation are exp'ressed by such insignia as tasselled corn or turtles in the headdress, pulque or rain god ear ornaments, and fertility or rain deity twisted-cord headband and fan-neck attachment. Exalted status is expressed by the jewelled headband. The two teeth and beard also express high status and venerated old age. Who is the Two-Horned God? What deity or complex of deities encompasses vegetation/fertility, venerated age, and supreme status? Hans Dietschy (1941) may have come the closest when he proposed a Tonacatecuhtl?-Quetzalcoatl fusion for the Basel Museum f?r V?lkerkunde sculpture. However, perhaps the allusions to Quetzalcoatl discussed by Dietschy are actually more generalized references to origins and creation, rather than to Quetzalcoatl himself. Among Quetzal coat I's many roles was his guise as a 11. Pulque is an alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juices of the maguey cactus, and its consumption was reserved for ceremonial occasions. 12. Tepeyollotl sometimes appears with such teeth and a beard, as in the Codex Borgia (fig. 11a), but he does not always bear these traits (cf. figs. 11b-c). 13. See n. 9 for pages in these manuscripts where Tepeyollotl appears.</page><page sequence="13">Nagao: The planting of sustenance 17 Creator god who remade humans from the bones and ashes of previous generations and the autosacrificial blood of the gods (Nicholson 1971: 400). The following is a clarification and amplification of Dietschy's original interpretation. Tonacatecuhtli, the Lord of Sustenance, was one of many appellations for the male aspect of the bisexual supreme progenitor of the universe, namely, Ometeotl or "Two Deity" or "Sacred Two." Representations of this deity have been unknown in Aztec sculpture and are rare in native-style pictorial codices (figs. 13-15; Codex Borgia 9). Tonacatecuhtli played an important symbolic role in the 260-day Aztec ritual calendar (tonalpohualli). Clearly associated with beginnings, Tonacatecuhtli was the lord of the first trecena (thirteen day period) and was the patron of the first of the twenty day signs, cipactli (Caso 1967). In ritual-divinatory almanacs with depictions of the patron of each of the twenty trecenas and associated volatiles (birds), day signs, and lords of the day and night, Tonacatecuhtli would appear prominently on the opening pages that are missing from such codices as the Codex Borbonicus and the Tonalamatl de Aubin. Although there is not a one-to-one correlation between sculptural variants and pictorial representations, the number of correspondences between the Two-Horned God and Tonacatecuhtli is greater than in the case of any other deity interpretation. Table 1 shows that the variants of pose and insignia most frequently relate to Tonacatecuhtli, the male half of the supreme creative principle, Ometeotl. Variants in the pose of the sculpture identify the deity as male and sometimes perhaps as bisexual in the act of parturition. Component parts of the headdress allude to two principles: vegetal fertility (or earth) and supreme status. These two concepts are reinforced by the pulque or rain god ear ornaments and the two protruding teeth, respectively. (The significance of the facial paint presents a problem not resolvable at present.) Of the interpretations posited to date (mountain god, Table 1.

Furthermore, only the supremacy and significance of Tonacatecuhtli and Xiuhtecuhtli would have been commensurate with the lavish offerings deposited with the sculpture. The clear emphasis on fertility, however, decreases the likelihood of the sculpture's identification as Xiuhtecuhtli and strengthens connections with Tonacatecuhtli. Tonacatecuhtli is associated with creation and sustenance on both cosmic and human levels. The creation of the world is credited to Tonacatecuhtli in several stories of cosmo-genesis (Corona N??ez 1964a: 179; Codex Vaticanus A Iv, 15v; Garibay K. 1964 I: 175; Garibay K. 1973: 23). Tonacatecuhtli's association with the beginning of the cosmos is repeated and reflected in his role as lord of the first trecena and as patron of the first day sign of the tonalpohualli (Codex Borgia 9, 61; Corona N??ez 1964a: 179; Codex Vaticanus A 12v). As supreme progenitor, Tonacatecuhtli or Ometeotl is said to reside in the highest of heavens, in Omeyocan or "Place of Duality" (Codex Vaticanus A Iv; Sahag?n 1969 Book 6: 176, 183, 187, 202: "Histoyre du Mechique" 1973: 103; Ponce de Leon 1973: 121; "Anales de Cuauhtinchan" 1975: 8; Garibay K. 1964 I: 93; Pomar 1964: 173; Garibay K. 1973: 23). Omeyocan is itself considered a source of life, and babies are said to have been sent to earth from Omeyocan (Garibay K. 1964 I: 27; Garibay K. 1965 II: XIX; Sahag?n 1958: 230; Sahag?n 1969 Book 6: 175, 176, 183, 187, 190, 202, 203, 206). In most of these sources, the names Tonacatecuhtli/Tonacacihuatl, Ometecuhtli/Omecihuatl, and Ometeotl appear interchangeably.14 References to Tonacatechutli/Tonacacihuatl, Ometecuhtli/Omecihuatl, or numerous other male/ female creator pairs as "Our Mother, Our Father" refer not only to the birth-giving aspects of these deities, but also to the parental role as protector and sustainer (Sahag?n 1969 Book 6: 13,21,27,31,36,48,58, 106, 153, 164ff.). "Our Mother, Our Father" appears as a recurrent appellation for a variety of deities, such as Ometecuhtli/Omecihuatl, Mictlantecuhtli, Xiuhtecuhtli, Tonatiuh, Tlaltecuhtli, looaltecuhtli/looalticitl, Chalchiuhuitlicue, and Chalchiuhtlatonac. It is also applied to the ruler (Sahag?n 1969 Book 6: 19, 23, 57-58, 63, 73, 75, 79, 88). In this latter context in particular, it becomes clear that such metaphorical allusions to parentage refer to the responsibilities of caring for, sustaining, and protecting the people, and not creation per se. Tonacatecuhtli therefore is not only the progenitor of humankind, but also the protector of his creation. On a human level, Tonacatecuhtli feeds the people by providing sustenance, especially maize (Corona N??ez 1964a: 179; Codex Vaticanus A 15v, 16v; Pomar 1964: 175).15 Tonacatecuhtli also provides divine sustenance, that is, human lives for sacrifice and autosacrifice, by sending babies to the earth. Thus, Tonacatecuhtli sustains the entire cosmos. What is the significance of the burial of Tonacatecuhtli? Sixteenth-century documents describe many Mexica ceremonies and ritual practices, but sources that refer specifically to objects buried in the Templo Mayor are rare (see Broda 1971; Matos 1981a). No sources mention the burial of the deity represented by the Two Horned sculpture. Nevertheless, pictorial manuscripts, native poetical or literary texts, and prose accounts provide considerable information on aspects of Mexica ritual and thought that indicate that the act of burial had a special symbolic meaning for the Mexica. The question posed by the title of this section can be articulated in two separate parts: (1) What is the significance of the act of burial to the Mexica? and (2) Why did the Mexica repeatedly bury an undamaged sculpture of Tonacatecuhtli? The act of burial had a multifaceted meaning for the Mexica that involved concepts of death, renewal, and protection. In mortuary contexts, burial was reserved for special groups of people. The way that a person died determined the treatment of the body and the ultimate destination of the soul. Most corpses were cremated and then buried (Sahag?n 1952 Book 3: 39-43; Codex Magliabechiano 66r-72r; Motolinia 1971: 304-307). The only individuals who were buried directly in the earth were young children or babies; women who died in childbirth; warriors who died in battle; and 14. The pair of names ending in -tecuhtli and -cihuatl refer to male and female aspects of the pair and translate as "lord" and "woman" respectively. 15. Poetically, Tonacatecuhtli's role as sustainer of humans is expressed in references to his showers of precious white flowers, izquixochitl derived from izquitl meaning popcorn and xochitl meaning flower, used as a metaphor for maize sustenance (Garibay K. 1964 I: 53, 79; Garibay K. 1965 II: 64, 100, 104; Heyden 1983: 39-43; Louise Burkhart, personal communication, 1984).</page><page sequence="15">Nagao: The planting of sustenance 19 individuals who died at the "hands" of Tlaloc by drowning, lightning, dropsy, or certain skin diseases (Sahag?n 1969 Book 6: 115-116, 161-162, 173; 1952 Book 3: 45, 47-48). These honored dead went to special afterworlds: Tonaca ichan, Cihuatlampa, Tonatiuh ichan, and Tlalocan respectively (Sahag?n 1969 Book 6: 115, 161; 1953 Book 7: 14,21; 1952 Book 3: 45, 47). They had special ties with the patron deities associated with the above-mentioned heavens, respectively Tonacatecuhtli (Lord of Sustenance), the Cihuapipiltin ("Noble Women"; deified women who died in childbirth), Tonatiuh ("Sun"; solar god), and Tlaloc (rain god). The corpses were often buried in special locations ? the symbolic "homes" of their respective supernaturals. Children, for example, were buried near granaries, sources of sustenance associated with the Lord of Sustenance, and women who died in childbirth were buried near the temple dedicated to their patron goddesses (Sahag?n 1969 Book 6: 116, 161-162). Often the bodies were dressed in the attire of the patron deity itself (Sahag?n 1952 Book 3: 45). Thus, location of burial, associated objects, and costume were symbolically significant aspects of these mortuary deposits. Certain sacrificial victims were also buried. Often it was rain or water deity impersonators or victims who were sacrificed and then buried. Rain god (Tlaloc) and water goddess (Chalchiuhuitlicue) impersonators were sacrificed during the festival of Etzalcualiztli, a ceremony dedicated primarily to rain deities, and their remains were put in a cavelike pit (Motolinia 1971: 64; Broda 1971: 292). Two young virgins were sacrificed during the scarcity-of-maize ceremony constituting part of the cycle of Tepeilhuitl, and their bodies were placed in an underground chamber at a shrine dedicated to the tlaloques, the assistants of Tlaloc (Broda 1971: 307). Similarly, during Xocotl huetzi, children of noblemen were decapitated in honor of Tlaloc, and their remains were placed in a stone box or in a pit near the idol of the god (Motolinia 1971: 66; Pomar 1964: 168-169; Broda 1971: 275).16 Based perhaps on the above associations between the act of burial and death, the term referring to the "hiding" of a person was a metaphorical allusion to the individual's death (Sahag?n 1969 Book 6: 21, 22, 105, 130, 136, 137, 195). The act of burial was also associated with life and the concept of renewal in several different reproductive cycles ? agricultural, zoological, and human. The act of burial parallels the planting of seeds as objects deposited in the earth to be "hatched" for the sustenance of humankind (Sahag?n 1963 Book 11: 283). The reproductive method of the turtle, a recurrent symbol associated with the Two-Horned God, mirrors this 16. To my knowledge there is no sacrifice in which the victims died by burial. However, there are references to victims who "go down into the sand" {xalaquia) prior to death in the festivals of Uei Tecuilhuitl and Panquetzaliztli, but apparently this rite was not a form of sacrifice (Heyden, personal communication, 1984; Sahag?n 1951 Book 2: 97, 133; 1959 Book 9: 63). These references to "entering the sand" become especially interesting when viewed in conjunction with the fact that many Tonacatecuhtli offerings from the Templo Mayor contain a layer of sand or sand and gravel on the chamber floor (for example, Templo Mayor Offerings 1, 6, 7, 11, 17, 20; Wagner 1982). The editors, Dibble and Anderson, of the English translation of Sahag?n 's Florentine Codex suggest that entering the sand was a ceremony that was literally enacted, but none of the chroniclers specifies precisely what the rite involved. At the eighth festival, Uei Tecuilhuitl, the Xilonen (corn goddess) impersonator performs the act on the day prior to her sacrifice in a scarcity-of-maize ritual (Sahag?n 1951 Book 2: 97ff.; Broda 1976). She is said to have performed this rite "in the four directions," listed as Tetama?olco, Necoquixecan, Atench?calcan, and Xolloco. These four places are located on the shores of Tenochtitlan on the axes formed by the avenues radiating out from the Ceremonial Precinct in the cardinal directions. The xalaquia ceremony was also performed during the fifteenth-month Panquetzaliztli, in honor of the Mexica patron god Huitzilopochtli and one of the four major times of the year when tribute was collected. Both male and female slaves who were to be sacrificed were taken to the Temple of Huitzilopochtli in the afternoon to perform this ceremony and were forced to drink an alcoholic beverage, which made them quite drunk (Sahag?n 1951 Book 2: 133; 1959 Book 9: 63). Brotherston (1974) has suggested that sand had a ritual function and that it was brought to temple precincts to be spread for some type of consecration ritual. During the Panquetzaliztli festival, the participants reenact the myth of Huitzilopochtli's defeat of Coyolxauhqui at Coatepec; an area called coaxalpan, "snake sand area," is said to be located at the foot of Coatepec (Brotherston 1974; Sahag?n 1952 Book 3: 3). Is this perhaps a reference to the Temple of Huitzilopochtli as Coatepec, with the coaxalpan as the platform of the Templo Mayor where serpent heads were located and sand spread on cache floors? On the other hand, a song dedicated to Yacatecuhtli, the god of the merchants, refers to a place where sand is spread; it is believed to allude to Tlalocan, the paradise of Tlaloc (Sahag?n 1958: 202). What was the significance of sand buried in Tonacatecuhtli caches? Did it relate to ceremonies in which sacrificial victims "entered the sand" or was the Tonacatecuhtli sculpture the "performer" of this ritual? Was the spreading of sand part of some construction ritual? Do references to places with sand symbolize parts of the Templo Mayor where sand was buried? Or was sand spread to identify symbolically a location as sacred in general or as a specific sacred place such as Tlalocan? Unfortunately, these questions cannot be answered at present.</page><page sequence="16">20 RES 10 AUTUMN 85 process of "planting" in the animal world, for turtles bury their eggs in the sand to hatch later as newborn turtles.17 The N?huatl verb toca means both "to plant" and "to bury" (Molina 1970: 148), and the supreme god of creation, Tonacatecuhtli or Ometeotl, was said to "plant" or "bury" a baby in the hearth of a home (Shahag?n 1969 Book 6: 172). These babies grew up to become the sustenance of the gods, just as maize and turtles were the sustenance of man. The act of burial also had another, more pragmatic significance to protect or to hide valuables. Inhabitants of a region south of Popocatepetl buried the local greenstone idol to protect it from the Spaniards (Duran 1967 I: 166). Similarly, since there was always the danger that the lavish offerings brought in honor of Tlaloc during the Uey Tozoztli festival by members of the highest elite might be stolen by the enemies of the Mexica, the nonperishable offerings were buried at the Tlaloc Temple (Duran 1967 I: 85; Broda 1971: 277ff.).18 Apparently burial was also a standard means of presenting an offering to the gods. Motecuhzoma II ordered priests to bury Cortes's gift of food at Tula (Duran 1967 II: 267; Alvarado Tezozomoc 1980: 691), for he feared that Cortes was the manifestation of Quetzalcoatl as the mythico-historical king of Tollan (Pasztory 1983: 13; Nicholson 1971: 429). Also, according to Duran (1967 II: 228; Matos 1981a: 190?191), Motecuhzoma I ordered lords of all towns to bring precious stones to be buried in the fill of the Templo Mayor, then under construction, as a sign of honor and reverence to his god. In response to the earlier posited question ? what is the significance of the act of burial to the Mexica? ? it appears that burial, as it does everywhere, operated on both a symbolic and a pragmatic level. Symbolically, burial was associated with the honored dead: those who died in particular sacrifices or under circumstances that indicated that they were "chosen" or "touched" by certain patron gods. At the same time, the act of burial was clearly linked symbolically with the world of the living and with survival in the form of agricultural, animal, and human reproduction and sustenance. In more practical terms, burial was a means of hiding hoarded valuables. Precious commodities were interred most frequently in the temple of a polity, the most sacred and thus the most tenaciously defended location and symbol for a political group. Although burial was one of many different ways of presenting an offering to the gods, it differed from other sacrifices, such as tossing an offering into a fire or into a body of water. Through burial an object was not destroyed, but rather was removed from circulation and hoarded in a specific immovable location. The burial of offerings in the Templo Mayor integrated the opposing meanings of burial ? life and death ? perhaps also channeling valued nonperishable commodities of the empire back into the empire. Furthermore, the permanent interment of precious and sacred objects in the Templo Mayor served to recharge the potency of the Templo Mayor as a powerful and effective political and ideological tool. Why did the Mexica bury the sculpture of Tonacatecuhtli? As mentioned earlier, insignia and costume elements transformed the wearer ? whether a human, a sculpture, or a bundle of sticks ? into an embodiment of the deity itself. Therefore, the burial of the sculpture of Tonacatecuhtli was equivalent to the interment of the god of sustenance and creation himself. The sculpture was fashioned most frequently out of an ordinary, locally available volcanic stone and was, therefore, not inherently valuable, but rather was symbolically valuable. The burial, planting, or hiding of Tonacatecuhtli in Templo Mayor caches on one level signified the death or sacrifice of Tonacatecuhtli. He was given an elaborate burial in the tradition of Aztec royal burials, but he was not cremated (cf. Duran 1967 II: 295ff., 31 Iff., 392ff.; Alvarado Tezozomoc 1980: 433ff., 454ff., 568ff.). On another level, it is significant that he was not mutilated or damaged in any way. He was buried as a "newly formed thing," the words used to describe offerings appropriate for the gods, including maize, flowers, food, living things, or whatever was newly grown or made (Sahag?n 1951 Book 2: 181). Because of the conceptual linkages between "burial" and "planting" to the Aztecs, it is particularly appropriate that a deity responsible for the continuation of life and agricultural abundance was "planted" in the Templo Mayor. However, Tonacatecuhtli was significant for additional reasons that linked him specifically to the symbolism of the Templo Mayor and to the Mexica view of their place within the universe. 17. The term for "hatch" {tlapana) is used to describe the growth and development of both maize and turtles (Sahag?n 1963 Book 11 : 60, 283). 18. The economic ramifications of buried valuables have been discussed for mortuary contexts (Brown 1975; Dwyer and Dwyer 1975). The buried offerings of the Mexica did not contribute to the glorification of an individual, however, but to the glorification of the state, symbolized by the Templo Mayor.</page><page sequence="17">Nagao: The planting of sustenance 21 What is the relationship between Tonacatecuhtli and the Templo Mayor? Throughout time in Mesoamerica, structures significant for religious as well as political reasons were the primary locations for cache interment. Nevertheless, the quantity of offerings in general as well as of this specific type buried in the Templo Mayor is striking. Aztec offerings from other sites, such as Tlatelolco (Espejo 1944, 1945), Chapultepec (Cabrera, Cervantes, and Solis 1975), Texcoco (Mateos Higuera 1934), and Tula (Acosta 1954, 1955), have been found. Although buried offerings undoubtedly served different social and symbolic functions, it is noteworthy that none of these centers has yielded offerings similar to those excavated in Tenochtitlan. To my knowledge, offerings containing the Two-Horned God have been found only in Tenochtitlan, with the vast majority from the Templo Mayor itself.19 There appears to be a particular relationship in meaning between Tonacatecuhtli and his place of interment at Tenochtitlan and in the Templo Mayor; thus, a few words about the symbolic significance of place would be appropriate. The capital of the Mexica Aztecs, Tenochtitlan, was a city constructed on an artificial island set in the marshy waters of Lake Texcoco. Although joined to the north to another, smaller island-city called Tlatelolco, both centers were essentially autonomous. Tenochtitlan, but not Tlatelolco, was divided into four quarters by four avenues that radiated out from the ceremonial precinct in the cardinal directions (Calnek 1976: 296). The layout of Tenochtitlan mirrored the Aztec view of the horizontal organization of the cosmos, which was divided into five world directions with the Ceremonial Precinct as the central direction (Nicholson 1971: 403). In the conceptual center of the Ceremonial Precinct was the principal temple of the empire, the Templo Mayor. This structure consisted of a low platform on which was elevated a tall pyramidal base with two stairways on the western side leading up to a pair of temples situated at the top.20 These twin temples were dedicated to a pair of opposing deities, Tlaloc (rain god) and Huitzilopochtli (god of war and the patron of the Mexica). These twin shrines have been considered a supreme place of duality, like Omeyocan, the highest of thirteen heavens where lived the gods of creation, Tonacatecuhtli and Tonacacihuatl or Ometeotl (Matos 1984: 22). The Templo Mayor was also considered an axis mundi, a place of passage between upper and lower realms (Matos 1983; 1984: 23). In fact, it has been suggested that the twin temples not only symbolized the highest of heavens, but also the pair of clashing hills in the netherworld that must be passed by the dead on their way to Mictlan, one of the Aztec places of afterlife (Matos 1984: 23,25). The Templo Mayor was also imbued with mythological significance. The general principle of a pyramid as a sacred mountain has already been treated by Krickeberg (1950), and more recently, parts of the Templo Mayor have been interpreted as specific sacred mountains. The placement of images of Coyolxauhqui, the treacherous sister of Huitzilopochtli and enemy of the Mexica empire, at the base of the temple transformed the Huitzilopochtli side of the Templo Mayor into Coatepec, the mythical location of her defeat (Matos 1981b: 51). At the same time, the hoarding and burial of sustenance, symbolized by greenstones and other offerings to the gods, converted the Templo Mayor into a symbolic Tonacatepetl, the mythological hill where sustenance was stored ("Leyenda de los Soles" 1975: 121; Broda, in press; Matos, in press). The interment of Tonacatecuhtli in both sides of the Templo Mayor suggests that the entire structure ? not just the twin temples at the top ? may have been symbolically elevated to be equated in its duality with Omeyocan, the home of Ometeotl in the highest of heavens. Even 19. Of the excavated sculptures of the Two-Horned God, at least sixteen of them probably come from the Templo Mayor: (1 and 2) Templo Mayor Offering 1 (two sculptures); (3) TM Room 2 Offering; (4) TM Offering 6; (5) TM Offering 7; (6) TM Offering 11 ; (7) TM Offering 12; (8 and 9) TM Offering 17 (two sculptures); (10) TM Offering 20; (11) TM Offering 24; (12) TM Offering 60; (13) TM Offering 61 (Wagner 1982; Matos, personal communication, 1985); (14 and 15) cache excavated in the 1940s by Moedano Koer and Estrada Balmori (Estrada Balmori 1979); (16) cache excavated in the 1960s by Contreras and ?ngulo (Contreras 1979; ?ngulo 1966b). The sculptures excavated by Batres (1902) might also have pertained to some level of the platform of the Templo Mayor. At least two other sculptures come from caches within the Ceremonial Precinct, although not part of the Templo Mayor itself, and these include (1) Temple A, Offering F (Matos 1982a), and (2) Templo Mayor Offering 16 (Matos, personal communication, 1985; Wagner 1982). The offering excavated in the area of El Volador (Noguera 1968), located to the south of the Ceremonial Precinct, contained a sculpture with two bumps on the head, probably representing the same deity. 20. Twin temples surmounting double pyramids apparently had a long history in the Basin of Mexico at Tenayuca, predating the Mexica Aztecs (Marquina 1964: 169), and perhaps also at Teotihuacan (Mill?n 1976: 238).</page><page sequence="18">22 RES 10 AUTUMN 85 after this encapsulated discussion of some of the aspects of the symbolic significance of the Templo Mayor, it is clear that the ideological messages generated by the Templo Mayor were many and varied. All of these layers of meaning were important and all served to proclaim the cosmic, religious, historical, political, and economic importance of the Mexica to their subjects and allies, as well as to their enemies. Although Tonacatecuhtli and Tlaloc are the major deities that have been found in Templo Mayor caches, the cult of the Templo Mayor is generally associated with Tlaloc and Huitzilopochtli, not Tonacatecuhtli. The different positions in time, space, ritual, and art that these three deities occupied reveal basic differences in the concept of the nature of each of these deities. Tlaloc, Huitzilopochtli, and Tonacatecuhtli played different roles in the symbolism of mythico-historical time. Tlaloc was considered an ancient god, associated with history and antiquity (Pomar 1964: 165; Pasztory n.d.). Huitzilopochtli, on the other hand, was considered a young god, the patron of the new Mexica nation. Tonacatecuhtli transcended mythico-historical time. He was older than ancient; he was timeless, for he was associated with the origins and beginnings of the universe and of time itself. The positions occupied by Tlaloc, Huitzilopochtli, and Tonacatecuhtli in cosmic space were also distinct. Although known primarily as a god of rain, Tlaloc was also a fertility god associated with the earth (Sullivan 1974). Huitzilopochtli, on the other hand, was associated with solar iconography and the sky. Tonacatecuhtli defied spatial bounds. He was associated with the center of the cosmos in the highest of heavens. Tonacatecuhtli's position was perhaps conceived of as a continuous central, vertical axis, an axis mundi, as opposed to a single level in horizontal space (Pasztory, personal communication, 1981). Cultic practices associated with these three gods also demonstrate their different roles. Many sacrifices and rituals for commoners and elites were known to have been dedicated to Tlaloc, who was a prominent figure in both the 260-day ritual calendar and the 365-day solar/ agricultural calendar. Huitzilopochtli was primarily the focus of Mexica elite cults. Although he did not play a role as a trecena patron in the 260-day divinatory calendar, he was prominently honored in several festivals during the 365-day solar calendar (Broda 1976). Tonacatecuhtli was not known to be the focus of any specific sacrifice, ritual, festival, or cult among the Mexica. However, he was undoubtedly a god important to all members of Aztec society as the first patron of the 260-day ritual calendar, commonly used for prognostications, naming newborn babies, and determining the fortunes of all undertakings. The relative visibility of Tlaloc, Huitzilopochtli, and Tonacatecuhtli exhibited in Aztec rituals is evident in sculptural representations of these gods as well. Tlaloc ?mages abound in a variety of different media (stone, greenstone, resin, ceramic), so he was a frequently seen, highly visible deity. It is striking that there are no known surviving sculptures of Huitzilopochtli. It has been suggested that the Huitzilopochtli idol was made of some perishable material, or perhaps as the major patron of the Mexica he was a particular target for destruction by the Spaniards. Paralleling his role in cultic practices, sculptural manifestations of Tonacatecuhtli may have been pervasive, but invisible. The chronicles say that Tonacatecuhtli was never depicted in human form (Pomar 1964: 175). Perhaps he was carved specifically to be hidden and buried so that he would not be visible. As supreme deity and as embodiment of cosmic duality, perhaps he was too sacred to be seen. Images of Tonacatecuhtli may have been carved specifically for burial in Tenochtitlan, his home in the highest of heavens. This would have served to identify the pivotal importance of the Mexica in the cosmos. Perhaps the burial of Tonacatecuhtli in the Templo Mayor has a specific historical significance. Tonacatecuhtli offerings may have been desperate appeals for sustenance made in connection with the devastating famine of 1454. Umberger (1981: 82) has already discussed the importance of this event in shaping Mexica calendrics, history, and art. On the basis of published information, it appears that Two-Horned God caches begin only during the fourth major construction epoch of the Templo Mayor, which has been linked to the reign of Motecuhzoma I (1440-1469) based on a date carved in relief on the back fa?ade of the Temple (Matos 1981b: 50). The date "1 Rabbit" has been correlated with the year 1454 (Matos 1984: 83), and one of the earliest caches containing the Two Horned God (Templo Mayor Offering 20) was found directly beneath this date plaque (Matos 1979b). The economic and political implications of the Mexica burial of great wealth were masked by the powerful ritual and symbolic associations of the Templo Mayor. The burial of Tonacatecuhtli in particular must</page><page sequence="19">Nagao: The planting of sustenance 23 have been intended to glorify and bolster the image of polity that the Mexica wanted to project. In the symbolism of Tonacatecuhtli and the Templo Mayor, the Mexica expressed their supremacy and the necessity for their rulership on various levels. In temporal terms, the burial of Tonacatecuhtli linked the Templo Mayor with primordial origins, proclaiming the creation of a new era by the Mexica just as Tonacatecuhtli created the world. In spatial terms, the Mexica attempted to portray themselves at the center of the empire and of the universe. The burial of Tonacatecuhtli in the Templo Mayor expressed symbolically the identification of the Templo Mayor and Tenochtitlan as center and as supreme place, just as Omeyocan, the place of duality, was the highest of all possible realms. It also identified the Templo Mayor with Tonacatepetl, the mythological Hill of Sustenance, paralleling Tenochtitlan's role as central redistributor for goods collected in tribute. The sacrifice and burial of Tonacatecuhtli was probably a petition for sustenance in the form of abundant maize. It implied that the Mexica were responsible for the continued supply of the maize that was essential for humankind.21 In cosmic terms, the sacrificial petition to the Lord of Creation and the interment of Tonacatecuhtli underscored the need for human births to feed the gods and singled out the Mexica as responsible for the continuation of the cosmos as a whole. ACKNOWLFDGMFNTS I am grateful to Elizabeth Boone, Louise Burkhart, Doris Heyden, Cecelia Klein, Eduardo Matos Moctezuma, Esther Pasztory, Francesco Pellizzi, Wendy Schonfeld, Carolyn T?te, and especially Emily Umberger for their comments and suggestions on earlier versions of this manuscript. Louise Burkhart and Karin Dakin were particularly helpful in reviewing N?huatl terms used in this paper. I also owe special thanks to Licenciado Pablo Elhore and Se?ora Esperanza Mora of the Departamento de Jur?dicos of the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog?a e Historia for permission to publish photographs pertaining to the institute. 21. The intimate link between the Aztec polity and the responsibility for ensuring the supply of maize sustenance also found expression mythologically. The transference of political power from the Toltecs to the Aztecs was symbolized through the acquisition of maize (Broda 1971: 285).
