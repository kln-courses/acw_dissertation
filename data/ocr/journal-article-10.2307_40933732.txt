<plain_text><page sequence="1">"To Shoot, Burn, and Hang": Folk- History from a Kentucky Mountain Family Community. By Daniel N. Rolph (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994) $25.00, cloth. Although nearby Greenup County was the home of Appalachian writer Jesse Stuart, Fleming County, Kentucky, and its neighboring counties along or near the Ohio River in northeastern Kentucky have not commanded the literary or sociological interest that southeastern Kentucky has won, much of it of dubious value to be sure. By unearthing a great wealth of "previously unrecorded and unpublished" traditional narratives in Fleming County, Daniel Rolph makes a potential though problematic contribution to under- standing the cultural history and folklore of an interesting and neglected corner of Appalachia. PAGE 102 - FALL 1995</page><page sequence="2">This short book (the text, exclusive of extensive notes and bibliography, is only 101 pages) examines four traditional narratives from Fleming County that share a common underlying theme, described in the author's words as that of "intense violence or murder, often infused with superstitious over- tones and beliefs" (p. xvi). The narratives, each described in a separate chap- ter, recount versions of four very colorful local events that the author care- fully shows were actual occurrences: (1) a violent mob attack on a local tem- perance leader in 1884; (2) the execution by burning of a local woman as a witch in 1898 or 1899; (3) church arson and violence directed at local con- verts to Mormonism in 1899; and (4) the lynching of a local white man for murder in 1903. Interestingly, the four events occurred near "Rolph Hollow" and involved in one way or another the author's direct ancestors and their neighbors. The narratives, then, are folk traditions in the author's own family which Rolph has carefully collected over a number of years and analyzed from a scholarly and interdisciplinary perspective. Besides the pleasure of telling some good stories, which these are, and bringing to public light such rich family narratives, Rolph also seems to have had at least two distinct scholarly purposes in mind in publishing this book. One is explicit and directly stated from the outset; the other is an agenda that emerges more slowly as the narration and exposition unfold. Rolph certainly makes good his stated intent of demonstrating "to folk- lorist and historian alike, the wealth of traditional lore and history that is still uncollected within this nation" (p. xvii). These are certainly rich and interest- ing local events and narrative traditions that he preserves and attempts to interpret Rolph also makes somewhat good his attempt "to illustrate the value of utilizing family and local traditions as tools in historical reconstruc- tion" (p. xvi). Since I am not a folklorist, I won't judge his methodology other than to say that his attempts to (1) examine both variations and continuities in narrative versions for what each may reveal, (2) corroborate stories with public records wherever possible, and (3) relate the genres and motifs of storytelling to possible contexts of cultural transmission appear on the sur- face to be reasonable. Although I have deep reservations regarding the inter- pretive framework for understanding Appalachia that Rolph uses to contextualize these narratives, about which I will say more below, I believe that he does a good job of showing how folk materials can supplement and enhance conventional history writing based on public records and other ac- counts, especially by illuminating the local belief systems and oral traditions within which events and personages are registered and remembered. According to Rolph, when the old-timers in Rolph's Hollow tell stories about the four violent events that occurred there, they tend to link them to supernatural occurrences - reported instances of curses and bewitchings, shape-shiftings from human to animal forms, ghosts, supernatural prophecies fulfilled, and the appearances of beastly forms taken to be the devil. In order to explain why this is so, Rolph distinguishes between two ways of accounting for such folk phenomena: the "cultural source hypothesis" and the "experien- PAGE 103 - APPALJ</page><page sequence="3">tial source hypothesis." His unstated agenda in writing the book seems to be to argue for the possible validity of the latter. According to definitions that Rolph provides in a glossary (p. 143), the cultural source hypothesis assumes that "supernatural experiences are ficti- tious products of tradition or imaginary subjective experiences shaped or caused by tradition." The experiential source hypothesis, on the other hand, assumes that "supernatural events in oral tradition are based on actual expe- rience, rather than perceived solely as products of a cultural tradition." If I understand his argument, Rolph wants us to consider the possibility that his ancestral kinsmen and their neighbors just might have "witnessed events and observed entities which lie outside the paradigm of reality presently accepted by conventional science" (p. 92). That our traditional forbearers saw such things more often than do we moderns, Rolph speculates, may have less to do with the "cultural baggage" (p. 91) that separates them from us than the changing opportunity to witness such events. He writes: If well-lit city streets, rather than dark country lanes, are the norm, along with VCRs, TVs, and radios, it is increasingly difficult to see revenants [ghosts], be they animal or anthropomorphic in shape, at least in the volume once attested. This is not to say that they do not exist - only that the opportunity to see such entities under traditional circumstances has diminished, and thus the "belief in the supernatural is demonstrably affected, (pp. 92-3) Now I guess I don't automatically have a problem with scholars who entertain the plausibility of ghosts or witches, and I doubt that Rolph is the only one of us to speculate that some of our ancestors had some pretty close encounters with the devil. But I get really perturbed when scholars like Rolph accept David Hackett Fischer (Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America, New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1989) as an authority on early Appalachia or rely upon characterizations about Appalachian feuds made by an unnamed "student of southern feuds" in 1901 rather than a credible scholar like Altina Waller (Feud: Hatf√¨elds, McCoys, and Social Change in Appalachia, 1860-1900, Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1988). Compared with believing in the supernatural, those are scholarly sins indeed. Rolph's discovery of local tales in eastern Kentucky about temperance and anti-temperance violence, about witchcraft, Mormon evangelism, and lynchings adds important stuff to our knowledge of preindustrial Appalachia and suggests neglected topics for further historical research. It is ironic, however, that a scholar who is implicitly critical of the "cultural baggage" that possibly gets in the way of perceiving the supernatural should be so uncritical of his own cultural baggage about Appalachia. Although Rolph complains in his introduction that much of the writing about Southern violence is often stereotypical and "too broad or all-encom- passing" (p. xvi), he relies on stereotypes himself to frame his own historical PAGE 104 - FALL 1995</page><page sequence="4">reckoning with Fleming County violence. Thus he claims that "The state of Kentucky, particularly during the nineteenth century, was devoid of any effec- tive system by which law and order could be maintained" (p. 97), and he contends that "Hardly anyone guilty of violent crimes such as murder ever went to jail" there (p. 99). Following Fischer, he explains the prevalence of Appalachian violence as an ethnic trait, asserting that "The violence of the [English] 'borders' continued as 'disorder' in the southern backcountry" (p. 99), even though he acknowledges that his stories recount an era of "social upheaval" (p. xvii). Finally, Rolph's insistence that Fleming County was "acutely homogeneous ... being almost exclusively Anglo-Celtic in origin" (p. 97) is contradicted by the very stories he relates which involve African-Ameri- cans, Irish Catholics, and itinerant Mormons. After all the hard work we've done in Appalachian Studies, it's blatant stereotyping like this that makes me want "to shoot, burn, and hang." DWIGHT B.
