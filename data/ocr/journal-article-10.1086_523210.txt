      <p>The earliest known cave paintings from the Paleolithic period depict horses, mammoths, and bison. At the dawn of art, humans chose to draw not themselves, but the animals around them instead. Where does the apparently universal impulse to represent animals in art come from? How does the practice of depicting, dramatizing, and trying our best to step into the minds of animals affect us? And how have the ways that we think about animals changed over time—through the invention of domestication, the birth of the industrialized city, and into the modern era of animal experimentation?</p>
      <p>The nine essays in Daston and Mitman’s slender, but ambitious, edited volume address these important questions. As they put it, their book is about the how and why of thinking with animals. Contributions on a wide range of topics, including the history of animal experimentation, the nature documentary industry, and perspectives on anthropomorphism from evolutionary biology result in a potpourri of fascinating facts and observations. For example, in their introduction, the editors point out that animals resist association with any specific gender, class, or race, perhaps accounting for their uncanny prevalence in advertising campaigns. Similarly, an essay by James A Serpell, a professor of human ethics and animal welfare, describes how pet owners tend to enjoy better survival after a heart attack than those without pets. Full of these kinds of tidbits, the volume works best as a catalogue of the many different ways that animals, and thinking with animals, impact scholarly and scientific work, as well as our day‐to‐day lives.</p>
      <p>But the book, as a whole, lacks coherence. Of course, this is not unusual for edited works, where contributors tend to focus on their favored topics without engaging one another. In this case, the practice seems particularly unfortunate because the subject matter really demands an interdisciplinary approach.</p>
      <p>Two exceptional essays avoid this pitfall and address a much wider audience than the members of the authors’ own fields. The first, by Paul S White, traces the simultaneous appearance of what would seem to be polar opposites—house pets and laboratory animals—in Victorian England, and it should be required reading for all scientists working with laboratory animals. The other chapter, by Elliot Sober, discusses the vagueness of the con cept of parsimony, or “Morgan’s Canon,” in evolutionary biology and comparative psychology. Essentially, is it more parsimonious to assume that we share a mental trait, say, with chimpanzees, because that trait was conserved over evolution, or is it more parsimonious to assume that a chimpanzee’s thinking is different from, and simpler than our own, until proven to the contrary? Juxtaposed, as they are in the book, these two essays form an extended meditation on the desire for, and difficulty of, obtaining rigor in the life sciences. Taken together, these chapters offer at least one explanation for humanity’s universal and ancient obsession over thinking with animals: at once like us and unlike us in so many ways, animals can highlight the most serious challenges to understanding ourselves.</p>
