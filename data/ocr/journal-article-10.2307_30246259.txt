Large burial crypts at certain sites contained the articulated remains of as many as nine individuals. It is suggested here that these mass burials resulted from mortuary practices in which some deceased community members were kept for a period of time in specialized rooms and eventually buried together in a single grave. Four lines of evidence support this possibility. RESUMEN Reciente excavacidnes en Tonto Basin identificaron evidencia de costumbres funerarias del Classico Salado quefueron irreconocible de antemano. Grandes criptas de entierros en ciertos sitios contenieron los huesos articulados hasta nueve individuos. Lo sugiere aqui que estos entierros conjuntos resultaron de costumbres mortuarios de que algunos miembros fallecidos de la comunidad estaban mantenido por algudn tiempo en cuartos especializados y eventualmente enterradosjuntos en una sola sepultura. Cuatro lineas de evidencia apoyan este posibilidad. Skeletal remains from nearly 480 individuals were excavated from over 20 Classic period Tonto Basin Salado sites as part of the Roosevelt Platform Mound study, a large cultural resource management project funded by the Bureau of Rec- lamation, Department of the Interior. The Classic period in the Tonto Basin is traditionally divided into the Roosevelt (ca. A.D. 1280-1350) and Gila phases (ca. A.D. 1320-1450). Major changes in architecture, material culture, demography, and settlement patterns distinguish these phases from the Preclassic. The Tonto Basin is located at the confluence of the Salt River and Tonto Creek in the moun- tainous transition zone of Central Arizona (Figure 1). Burials were investigated at different kinds of sites including small residential compounds, large roomblocks, and integrative sites such as platform mounds. The interments are largely from two groups of sites: one located on Cline Terrace along lower Tonto Creek, and the other on Schoolhouse Point along the Salt River. A surprisingly large number of burial facilities were found that contained the articulated remains of multiple individuals (Loendorf 1996a, 1996c, 1997a, 1997b). Two types of burial facility with more than one articulated person are defined, and an example of each type is described. The distinction between these two types is</page><page sequence="2">320 LOENDORF SARIZONA ""Tonto Basin PA..YSON Study Area . /GLOBE-MAMI K oo --Cline Terrace Mount- zC&lt;n Mou K-d ( Kilometers SSchoolhouserCineMesaaSite SArchaeologicalSite i / Kilometers &lt; Figure 1.

Patterns in the regional distribution and nature of these features suggest that the inclusion of multiple individuals in a single feature was intentional, and that the practice sym- bolized and reinforced the sociopolitical structure of Salado communities. Four possible explanations for these multiple burials are considered, and arguments against two of these possibilities are presented. The final part of this article con- siders four lines of evidence supporting the possibility that mass burials resulted from keeping deceased family members in charnel houses and eventually inter- ring them in a mass grave. TYPE 1 MULTIPLE INTERMENTS Type 1 multiple burials consisted of a pit with two or three superimposed articulated individuals. One or more completely disarticulated individuals also were frequently found in these facilities. These features were fairly widely distrib- uted in the Tonto Basin, and were excavated at eight sites (Table 1). Facilities also exist where articulated individuals were resting side by side, but it is unclear if this reflects the same type of burial practice, and these individuals are not in- cluded in Table 1. These facilities differed in their morphology, but wooden caps, stepping, and/ or undercutting were often present. Examples were identified where two superim- posed individuals were both male, both female, different sexes, and adults with subadults, suggesting that the pairing of individuals was not restricted to mothers with infants or married couples, as has been implied by Hohmann (1992). In most instances, the deeper of the two individuals was associated with the largest assemblage. Upper individuals were generally offset so that the skeletal material did not rest directly above the cranium of the deeper individual. Type 1 multiple burial facilities were generally deeper than burial pits in the same cem- etery that contained only one individual. An Example of a Type 1 Facility from AZ U:4:7 (ASM) AZ U:4:7 (ASM) was an unusual compound that had a large pitroom at its center. The site also had a high proportion of plaza to room space, and appears to have been some type of community integrative site. In contrast to other integrative sites, where the large rooms were culturally filled at the advent of the Roosevelt phase to create platform mounds, the pitroom at AZ U:4:7 (ASM) appears to have continued to be used during the Roosevelt phase and was not abandoned until after the start of the Gila phase. A Roosevelt phase Type 1 burial facility excavated at the site contained the remains of two articulated individuals, and portions of two other disarticulated interments were also present. The maximum pit dimensions were 0.75 m wide,</page><page sequence="4">Table 1. Articulated Individuals from Type 1 Burials in the RPMS Assemblage (Page 1 of 2).

The pit was undercut at the base on the east end, and along the west half of the south wall. No evidence of a wooden cap was identified. Feature 49 was the highest burial encountered, and was a fully disarticulated old adult female that appears to have been a primary inhumation disturbed when the burial pit was reused. The remains were partially stacked in a pile, with addi- tional elements scattered in the fill. A Salado Red bowl was resting on the bone pile, and two partial vessels were near the pit margin. The upper articulated individual (Feature 50) was a 35- to 45-year-old male interred with the head on the west (Figure 2). The body was placed off-center in the pit, along the north edge. The cranium was tilted forward and rested near the west end. The off-center placement and cranium position of Feature 50 were atypi- cal and suggest that this individual was positioned with respect to Feature 51 below. A left humerus fragment not from Features 49, 50, or 51 was found directly above the left humerus of Feature 50. A metacarpal also not from Features 49, 50, or 51 was found on the rib cage of Feature 50. The position of the humerus frag- ment suggests that these elements were intentionally placed with Feature 50; how- ever, what occurred to the remainder of this individual and why it was interred with Feature 50 is unclear. The lower articulated individual (Feature 51) was a 25- to 35-year-old male interred with the head toward the east, at an average of 0.25 m below Feature 50 (Figure 3). The lower body was stained with red ochre, which was especially heavy on the tibias. The individual was associated with 17 whole or reconstruct- ible vessels, including a homed toad effigy vessel and a vessel with snake effigies. Small fragments of azurite paint that may have been the remains of an extremely poorly preserved painted stick were collected from next to the left side lower leg. Over 5 cm of fill separated the artifacts associated with Feature 51 and the skeletal material of Feature 50. Thus, the position of Feature 51 was obscured when Feature 50 was placed, and the placement of these two individuals with respect to one another suggests that they were buried at or close to the same time. TYPE 2 MULTIPLE INTERMENTS The second, and less-common, type of multiple interment consisted of large and elaborate crypts with wooden caps that contained between five and nine ar- ticulated individuals. Only five relatively intact examples of this type of facility were excavated (Table 2); however, at least seven disturbed facilities may have been similar features (four were vandalized, and three were disturbed prehistori- cally). Type 2 multiple burial facilities included males and females, as well as subadults. In all examples, individuals were interred with different orientations or positions (i.e., supine and prone, or with opposite head orientations).</page><page sequence="7">Salado Multiple Interments 325 Figure 2.

All five adults in the facility had fused foot bones, and four of the five adults had fusion of exactly the same phalanges, which is considered a genetic trait (Sarrafian 1983:102). Commonalities among Type 2 multiple burials suggest that all may have contained groups of closely related people. As was the case for most Type 1 multiple-burial facilities, the deepest articu- lated individual in Type 2 facilities was, with only one exception, associated with the largest number of accompaniments (Figure 5). The next highest interment was an individual of the opposite sex that was offset so the skeletal material did not rest directly above the cranium of the lower individual. It is unlikely that this increase in accompaniments with depth is the result of settling, because this would have resulted in the disarticulation and settling of upper individuals, as well the movement of accompaniments. Furthermore, in all instances, vessels or other ac- companiments were found at different and discrete depths that coincided with the depths of articulated individuals. Figure 4.

Boxplots of artifact counts by burial position in Type 1 and Type 2 facilities and single inhumations. Intact examples of Type 2 facilities were identified at only two sites (AZ U:8:24 [ASM] and AZ U:8:450 [ASM]). Because their large size makes them easy to find, these pits may have been more prone to vandalism. Additional ex- amples were probably originally present at other sites in the basin (several large vandalized features at Tonto Basin sites AZ U:4:9 [ASM] and AZ U:4:10 [ASM] may have been Type 2 facilities); however, Type 2 burial facilities were not iden- tified at most small residential compounds where undisturbed burials were exca- vated, and it is clear that Type 2 facilities occurred at only a few sites. An Example of a Type 2 Facility from AZ U:8:450 (ASM) AZ U:8:450 (ASM) was one of several small Roosevelt phase compounds clustered near where the Schoolhouse Point Mound (AZ U:8:24 [ASM]) was con- structed in the Gila phase. Two cemeteries were identified at the site, one of which included at least three Type 2 multiple-burial facilities. One of these Type 2 facilities consisted of a large and complicated crypt with wooden beams. The northern wall and eastern two-thirds of the south wall were</page><page sequence="14">332 LOENDORF stepped, and the western one-third of the south wall was undercut. The maximum dimensions were approximately 1.8 m wide, 5 m long, and 1.35 m deep. An estimated 18 individuals were interred in the crypt, including nine com- pletely disarticulated individuals, three partially articulated individuals, and six articulated individuals. The three partially articulated individuals (Features 50, 54, and 55) were superimposed along the south edge of the crypt. These individu- als appear to have been part of an earlier burial event that was disturbed by a later Type 2 multiple burial. The articulated portions appear to have remained in situ because the crypt was remodeled, and as a result they were below a step in the south wall. The disturbed portions of these individuals were, however, completely disarticulated, suggesting that connective tissue was not present and that time must have passed between the burial events. Feature 55, the highest partially articulated individual, consisted of articu- lated vertebrae and a pelvis (Figure 6). The articulated legs and hands of a differ- ent individual (Feature 50) were found below (Figure 7). Feature 54 (Figure 8) was an articulated upper body that was immediately below Feature 50, but the orientation of the body was roughly 180 degrees opposite. If considered together, Features 50 (pelvis), 54 (upper body), and 55 (lower body) appear to be the re- mains of a single individual; however, they were compared and could not have been from the same person (Marcia Regan, personal communication 1996). The articulated portions that remained appear to be a coincidence, resulting from their alternating head orientations and the location of the remodeling. A young adult (Feature 64) and an approximately 1.5-year-old child (Feature 33) were the highest articulated individuals in the pit. Feature 39, a 59- to 71- year-old female, was interred below Feature 33. Disarticulated skeletal elements were scattered in the fill around Feature 39, and skeletal remains from three indi- viduals (Features 43, 44, and 45) were partially stacked in a pile and placed in ceramic vessels at the feet of Feature 39. Feature 49, a 28- to 36-year-old male, was interred 25 cm below Feature 39. A band of red ochre staining extended above the left eye and below the right eye. A large number of vessels were concentrated west of the feet, including a high percentage of decorated wares and several unusual vessel forms, sulch as vessels with effigies. These artifacts were around and above the lower legs of Feature 53, which rested roughly 0. 15 m lower than Feature 49. All of the vessels in this concentration may have been associated with both Features 49 and 53. Feature 68, a 0.5- to 1-year-old child, was interred below the undercut in the south wall of the crypt. Red ochre staining was present on the right leg of the body. The individual was slightly higher (roughly 0.05 m) than Feature 53, and vessels were also placed between these two individuals. Feature 53, a 33- to 46-year-old female that also had red ochre staining on the skeletal material, was the deepest articulated individual in the crypt. A total of 46 vessels was found within less than 0.50 m from the body. It is interesting to note</page><page sequence="15">Salado Multiple Interments 333 Figure 6.

These were the only jars of this type in the burial assemblage of over 820 vessels.. Several lines of evidence suggest that the articulated individuals in the crypt must have been interred at the same time. First, the articulated individuals in the crypt were very close to one another but were not disturbed, whereas the remains of 12 other individuals had been extensively disturbed. Second, ceramics were generally placed around the upper bodies of interments, but a large group of ce- ramic vessels was placed between the feet of Features 49 and 53, suggesting that they were placed in association with both individuals. Third, there was patterning in the alignment and positioning of articulated individuals. Fourth, conjoinable sherds were collected from around different individuals in the crypt (Loendorf 1997b:562). Rather than being reopened each time an individual died, the data suggest that this crypt was reopened only once or twice and each time a group of people was interred. The possibility that the crypt was used for three Type 2 multiple burials is supported by the observation that six articulated individuals appear to have been placed in the final event; if six individuals were buried in each of two previous burial events, the total would be 18 individuals (the estimated number in the crypt). THE IMPLICATIONS OF MULTIPLE BURIALS The patterning observed among multiple burial facilities of both types sug- gests that they did not result exclusively from expedient burial practices (i.e., that it was easier to put a second burial in previously disturbed fill, or that there was accidental intersection of burial pits or limited space in cemeteries). Instead, it is likely that the interment of more than one individual in the same facility was inten- tional, and reserved for special situations. The extensive and diverse artifact assemblages associated with most Type 1 and 2 multiple burials, the large size of the pits, and the elaborate nature of the facilities all suggest that only high-ranking individuals were interred in these fea- tures. The variation observed in the treatment of individuals in these facilities (i.e., the deepest individual was almost always associated with the largest number of artifacts) suggests that ranking also occurred in these groups. Several explanations can be offered to account for multiple burials, but the first two possibilities are contradicted by observations already presented. First, crypts were reopened over time, and additional individuals were added to the facility. Second, mass deaths occurred due to warfare or disease, and these indi- viduals were therefore interred together. Third, multiple burials may have resulted</page><page sequence="19">Salado Multiple Interments 337 viduals were therefore interred together. Third, multiple burials may have resulted from the sacrifice of individuals at the death of a high-ranking community mem- ber (the deepest individual in the facility). Fourth, deceased individuals may not have been interred immediately; instead, the remains were curated for a time, and groups of individuals eventually were interred together. Several observations negate the first possible explanation. First, the pattern of artifact counts increasing with depth would not occur if individuals were sim- ply added to facilities as they died; burial accompaniments are commonly thought to be associated with social status (Saxe 1970; Binford 1971; Carr 1994), and individuals with the highest artifact counts should therefore occur in various posi- tions among facilities. Put another way, deaths of individuals with different social status would not occur in a patterned order. Second, in several cases the proximity of articulated individuals suggests that they must have been placed in the facility simultaneously. Third, skeletal elements do not dissociate at uniform rates during decomposition (Ubelaker 1989:31); if individuals were added to a burial facility over time, then a range of partially articulated elements, as are found in ossuaries, should be present, rather than the fully articulated and fully disarticulated burials that were observed. Other observations contradict the possibility that mass burials resulted from disease or warfare casualties. First, each Type 2 multiple burial facility contained individuals of both sexes and different age groups, which in at least one instance appear to have been closely related genetically; such groups of individuals would not be consistently expected for disease or warfare casualties. Second, individuals in multiple burials were generally associated with considerably larger artifact as- semblages than were single burials; it is highly unlikely that high-ranking indi- viduals would consistently die together. Third, Type 2 multiple burials were not randomly distributed among cemeteries, and were instead concentrated in a few cemeteries where they composed the majority of facilities; if mass burials resulted from disease or warfare then they should be distributed among cemeteries at dif- ferent sites. Although it is more difficult to rule out that human sacrifice resulted in mass burials, it is argued here that these features resulted from the delayed interment of deceased individuals. The following sections present four lines of evidence that support the delayed interment hypothesis. ETHNOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE This section summarizes ethnographic research that suggests delayed inter- ment may have been practiced in the Southwest during prehistoric times. Only material from U.S. Southwestern groups is presented; however, numerous explicit examples of charnel behavior have been recorded for North and South America</page><page sequence="20">338 LOENDORF (see Nelson et al. 1992:305). For example, the Huichol Indians in Western Mexico displayed the mummified bodies of dead leaders in "ancestor houses" (Nelson et al. 1992:305). A number of Puebloan stories include mummy-like characters that are re- ferred to as "skeletons" (Parsons 1994:61-64, 81-90; Cushing 1988:34-53; Voth 1905:120-122; Tyler 1986:71-72). Although none of these stories specifically de- scribes the process that is postulated to have created Type 2 multiple burials, they do suggest that the roles the deceased played in people's lives changed over time. The stories also imply knowledge of processes associated with storing deceased individuals and the nature of desiccated bodies. These stories share several common themes. The hero at first perceives the "skeleton" as an attractive, healthy individual. Upon closer examination the hid- eous appearance (sometimes described as sunken eyes, drawn-back lips, and ex- posed teeth), and stench of the "skeleton" are apparent. The hero then attempts to escape, which usually requires supernatural assistance. The moral in each story is that the dead are dangerous and should not be associated with too closely. For example, in a Tewa tale recorded by Parsons (1994:22-24), the wife of Olivella Flowers dies, and after four days he sees smoke from a fire to the south. He goes to investigate and discovers a house with his wife inside. He promises to live with her but is driven away by the stench. She chases him, and he requires the assistance of T'owa'e to escape. "That is why we make four days and then send the dead away from here, they do not belong here" (Parsons 1994:23). A Zuni story (Cushing 1988) provides another example of this type of tale. A young man is given an eagle suit and, disregarding warnings, uses it to fly to a large village beyond mountains on the southern horizon. He arrives in the evening and finds the village full of life, with fires burning and activity everywhere. After being entertained by the village inhabitants, he lies down to sleep with two young women. He awakes to discover "here and there a face half buried in the sand, with eyes sunken and dried and patches of skin clinging to it, seemed to glare at him. Fingers and feet, as of mummies, were strewn about" (Cushing 1988:49). The youth ties to escape, but the girls' parents awaken and observe that the arms and legs of their children have been broken off. The dead chase the youth, and he requires the assistance of the Badgers to escape. When he returns home, his wife admonishes him, saying, "Why did you go and become enamored of Death, how- ever beautiful?...Who would dance and take joy in Death?" (Cushing 1988:51). The observation that these stories warn against direct association with dead bodies ("skeletons") could be construed to contradict the delayed interment hy- pothesis; however, if this practice was not known, why was it strongly warned against? The severe population losses suffered by Native American groups after the introduction of European diseases are likely to have overwhelmed traditional mortuary programs, especially extended and elaborate practices of the type sug- gested here. Also, the transmission of some diseases like smallpox would be fa-</page><page sequence="21">Salado Multiple Interments 339 cilitated by long periods of handling and processing the deceased. Although pre- historic people may not have made this direct association, it would have been possible for them to observe that individuals who were closely involved in the handling of the dead died at higher rates, and this could have resulted in the abandonment of the practice. Even if this was not the case, because the practice appears to have been restricted to a small segment of communities, the severe demographic changes may have eliminated it. Furthermore, the effects of Spanish Catholicism and systematic attempts to exterminate native ceremonialism are likely to have suppressed or masked this type of practice. Given this situation, it is prob- able that some mortuary rituals were altered, and/or other items (e.g., masks or carved representations) were substituted for the physical body of the dead. In contrast to these stories, which warn against close association with the dead, a central figure in Hopi religion (Maasaw) is an anthropomorphic being with mummy-like characteristics. Maasaw is an "omnipresent deity [that] embraces the whole spectrum of Hopi reality, from anthropogeny to apocalypse" (Malotki and Lomatuway'ma 1987:vii). "The Hopi word Maasaw represents something like an 'animate conceptualization of death"' (Malotki and Lomatuway'ma 1987:4). Maasaw is considered to be a god of the underworld, the surface of the earth, war, fertility, land ownership, hunting, fire, and travelers (Malotki and Lomatuway'ma 1987:3; Tyler 1986:4; Titiev 1992:134-135; Mails and Evehema 1995:45-55; Waters 1963:21-22). In many respects, the varied roles of Maasaw may seem paradoxical. For example, he is a deity of death and the underworld, but he is also the caretaker of the present world and is closely associated with fertility. Descriptions of Maasaw's appearance are consistent with that of a mummi- fied person, and he is commonly considered to be a dead and decomposed being (Malotki and Lomatuway'ma 1987:32). He is usually described as wearing a ter- rible-looking mask over a large, bloody, and hairless head, but he can also assume the appearance of a richly ornamented, handsome man (Tyler 1986:5-6). Except for this mask, which stands for death and decay, he "is a human being just like us" (Malotki and Lomatuway'ma 1987:19). He is said to emit a horrible stench, and for this reason his impersonators visit graves to remove a "pus"-covered dress for their costume (Malotki and Lomatuway'ma 1987:130). He is also described as having a large head and feet, which may be explained by the fact that desiccation reduces the size of these portions of the body less than the torso, and thus the head and feet appear large in comparison to the rest of the body. In general, his appear- ance and mannerisms contradict traditional Hopi ways, which reflect the opposi- tion between life and death that he embodies. Oral traditions of the Oraibi Hopi hold that Maasaw provided the basis for land-ownership claims. According to one story (Voth 1905), Maasaw controlled all of the land at the time of the emergence from the underworld. He then gave land at Oraibi to Matcito, chief of the bear clan, after which Maasaw disappeared. Other groups then sought permission to live at Oraibi. Each group offered a ben-</page><page sequence="22">340 LOENDORF eficial ceremony in return for land, and if Matcito was pleased he would say, "very well, you [may] participate in our cult and help us with the ceremonies" (Voth 1905:24). This story differs in details, but shares some broad similarities with Piman origin stories (Bahr et al. 1994; Shaw 1968). In each case, the previous world is destroyed because of transgressions of the people, after which they emerge from the underworld to populate the present world. A number of parallels also exist between Maasaw and Elder Brother or Siuuhu of the Piman stories. Both are an- thropomorphic deities that are caretakers of the previous and present worlds. Both were closely involved with the emergence of the people from the previous world, both then give land ownership to the people, and both leave after the emergence. Maasaw also has an important role in the Wuwutcim, or new-fire ritual, a practice that includes unusual aspects involving the dead. "The major ceremony [of the ritual] is so sacred and secret that no one talks about it" (Waters 1963:143). It is generally held every four years, and is part of the initiation of young men into the society. On the night of this ceremony, all paths into the village are closed, except for a route for the spirit people to enter. Titiev (1992:136) reports that a group of Kwan men visits the cemetery at this time to strip recently interred corpses of their foul-smelling clothes, and afterward appear before the initiates dressed in these clothes, where they are readily mistaken for the dead relatives whose ap- parel they wear. The Hopi attribute elements of the Wuwutcim ceremony to a southern origin, and aspects of this ceremony bear a striking resemblance to the Tohono O'odham Wiikita ceremony (Teague 1993:447). Although there are fewer O'odham ethno- graphic accounts of close association with the dead, they did regard the burial locations of some shamans as sacred places, which they revisited and left offer- ings (Ezell 1983:152). Close interaction with deceased ancestors is also clearly symbolized in the Kachina cult. Deceased Puebloans who behaved properly in life were thought to become Kachinas (Fewkes 1927:485; Titiev 1992:108; Adams 1991:3; Waters 1963:165). Among the Hopi, when respected individuals are buried they are ad- dressed: "You are no longer Hopi, you are changed (nih'ti, grown into) a Kachina, you are cloud" (Tyler 1986:79). It is believed that in ancient times "real Kachinas" visited the pueblos, but when they came they would take someone with them (i.e., someone died), so they no longer return to the pueblos in person and are instead impersonated today (Bunzel 1992:517; Tyler 1986:77). Masks are used to make the impersonations more realistic, or closer to the ancestral ceremony (Fewkes 1927:486). Bunzel (1973:845) writes, "the masks are representations of the dead, and, indeed, the very substance of death." There are two kinds of masks: one type is held in trust by a group and passed down between generations, and the other is an item of personal property that was made and used by an individual. The right to</page><page sequence="23">Salado Multiple Interments 341 impersonate particular Kachinas is hereditary; when a owner of a personal mask dies, it is buried with him (Waters 1963:167; Bunzel 1973:848). The elements of ancestor worship apparent in the Kachina cult are generally not emphasized by ethnographers, and it is usually characterized as a form of generalized ancestor worship (Dockstader 1985:13-15; Bunzel 1992:516-525; Titiev 1992:171-173). However, aspects of ancestor worship are clearly present in the cult. Many Kachinas represent specific people, and the right to impersonate these now mythical individuals is hereditary-indeed, the different Hopi clans consider certain Kachinas to be clan ancestors. Maasaw also appears as a Kachina, and specific clans consider him to be an ancestor. It is suggested here that the Kachina cult developed, in part, from an earlier belief system that involved a less generalized form of ancestor worship, one in which the actual bodies of deceased community members were used (i.e., real Kachinas). ETHNOHISTORIC EVIDENCE Several historic descriptions of the storage and display of deceased high- ranking community members have been reported for the greater Southwest. These accounts demonstrate that delayed interment occurred during the early historic period in the general region, and provide circumstantial evidence that the Salado may have had similar practices. Weigand and Foster (1985:145) report that Arias de Saavedra described seated mummies at one of the great ceremonial sites of the Mesa de Nayar. The display of dead leaders' bodies was also reported by Bartolome de Las Casas in Northern Mexico, where eviscerated and desiccated bodies were said to have been leaning against the walls of a tall mud-and-stone temple (Riley 1987). Another Spanish report from 1624 relates the story of a shrine encountered along the Yaqui river drainage that held the seated corpse of an "indio principal." The individual was thought to have died from a lightning strike, and offerings of value were brought to the shrine (Riley 1987). In each case the house where mummies were kept was apparently outside of immediate habitation areas. As will be discussed further below, possible charnel houses that have been excavated in Tonto Basin are also separate from the main room blocks at sites. ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE A shaft and chamber tomb recently excavated at Huitzilapa in West Mexico appears to have been remarkably similar in some respects to Type 2 multiple buri- als excavated in Tonto Basin (Pickering 1996). Although this feature is relatively far removed in time and space from the Classic period Salado, the tomb demon-</page><page sequence="24">342 LOENDORF strates that the processes that are postulated to have generated Type 2 multiple burial facilities occurred in prehistoric North America. In contrast to the Salado multiple burial facilities, the preservation of skeletal material was excellent and allowed for more detailed observations. The tomb contained the remains of six adults (3 male and 3 female), five of which exhibited skeletal evidence that they were closely related genetically (Pickering 1996). Skeletal evidence also suggested that five individuals were curated for a period of time after death, and then buried together as a group when the sixth individual died (Pickering 1996). At least two rooms have been excavated in the Tonto Basin that may repre- sent features for storing deceased individuals prior to burial. Skeletal remains from an estimated 10 individuals were identified at or near the floor of Room 3 at AZ U:3:49 (ASM), a Classic period site in the lower Tonto Basin (Hohmann 1985:257-264). This burned room was separated from other rooms at the site and was immediately adjacent to an unusually large cemetery. Room 3 had an atypical floor assemblage, including artifacts of exotic materials (Hohmann 1985:238), but also included metates and other food-processing items. Two adult females, a juvenile female, an adult male, four adults of unknown sex, and two adolescents were estimated to be present in the room. Portions of the skeletal elements were still articulated, and burning patterns also suggested that desiccated flesh was present at the time of deposition. Although the remains consisted largely of frag- mented long bones, this may, in part, be the result of postdepositional disturbances. A structure (Feature 175) similar to Room 3 was excavated at the School- house Point mound (AZ U:8:24 [ASM]). The room was also outside of the main roomblock at the site, and was one of four isolated rooms in the area; the remain- ing three rooms were not fully excavated. Four Gila phase cemeteries were iden- tified at the site, and each room could represent a charnel structure associated with a particular cemetery. Skeletal material from a 12.5- to 13.5-year-old indi- vidual was largely disarticulated and scattered across the room floor. The skeletal elements were in direct contact with the floor below roof- and wallfall, indicating that the body was placed in the room when the structure was still standing. None of the other rooms excavated at this large site had a substantial proportion of the remains of an individual on the floor. Food-processing implements, storage fea- tures, and a variety of other artifacts were present in the room. One problem in identifying these features as charnel structures is that both rooms had floor assemblages that were not clearly distinguished in all aspects from other room assemblages at their sites; hearths, manos, and metates were found in the rooms. However, the presence of these features and artifacts does not necessarily indicate that they were ordinary residences. It is possible that domes- tic artifacts were kept in these rooms because they were houses for the dead, and as such they were equipped with the same features and items as houses for the living. Furthermore, both rooms were distinguished from other rooms in several respects; each was separated from the main group of rooms at their sites, both</page><page sequence="25">Salado Multiple Interments 343 were constructed in anachronistic styles that differed from other rooms at their sites (Hohmann et al. 1985; Lindauer 1996), and each was the only room at its respective site with substantial amounts of human skeletal material on the floor. In addition, the home of Maasaw is said to contain a metate and mano (Malotki and Lomatuway'ma 1987:124-125). Remains from two individuals (Feature 118) excavated at the Cline Terrace Platform Mound exhibited unequivocal evidence that they were curated, for what may have been an extended period of time, prior to interment (Loendorf 1997a). The recovered remains were mainly long bone elements, but fragments of the pelvis, cranium, and shoulder girdle were also present. The articular surfaces of the long bone were missing, and holes had been drilled into the marrow cavities at both ends. One possibility is that sticks were inserted into the holes and used to re- articulate the elements. The bone ends were polished, suggesting extended han- dling (Regan and Turner 1997). Similar groups of skeletal elements were collected in a structure at La Quemada. Nelson et al. (1992) suggest that these remains are evidence for the existence of charnel structures at the site, a mainly Epiclassic (A.D. 600-900) oc- cupation in Zacatecas, Mexico. A large temple at the site contained the remains of between 11 and 14 individuals. The skeletal material consisted of cranial ele- ments, pelvis fragments, long bones, ribs, and portions of the shoulder girdle. Food-processing implements (manos) were also recovered from this structure. The list of elements recovered from the temple at La Quemada is very similar to that recovered from Room 3, Feature 175, and Feature 118 in the Tonto Basin. Nelson, et al. suggest that the limited range of elements at La Quemada resulted from decomposition and processing of the body prior to being stored, with smaller elements being discarded. Alternatively, the limited types of elements from these contexts may be the result of differential preservation of skeletal material (i.e., the recovered elements are those that are generally most resistant to decomposition). This process may have been intensified by the unusual formation processes (i.e., mummification and subsequent handling) and postdepositional disturbances (i.e., the remains were not interred, and may have been intentionally disturbed prehis- torically). THEORETICAL OBSERVATIONS This section postulates why delayed interment may have been practiced by the Salado. Aspects of this discussion are difficult to support empirically; how- ever, several archaeological and ethnographic observations are presented that are consistent with the general outline of this scenario. Although diffusion from cul- tures to the south may have played an important role, it is possible to suggest a model for the indigenous development of delayed burial.</page><page sequence="26">344 LOENDORF Delayed interment may have been necessary during the Preclassic, when cre- mation was practiced, and this could have set the stage for the elaboration of this practice during the Classic period. Cremation requires the collection of a substan- tial quantity of wood. Especially if the death was not anticipated, the wood collec- tion probably occurred after death, delaying immediate cremation. Data suggest that wood was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain at the end of the Preclassic (Loendorf 1996c), and this may have lengthened the time required to collect nec- essary materials. The time delay would have resulted in desiccation of the body. This would have greatly facilitated incineration, and saved already-limited fuel resources. Support for delayed cremation is provided by the very extensive nature of the incineration in most Salado cremations. For example, almost all of the cremated bone at the Meddler Point cremation cemetery was completely incinerated (Swartz et al. 1995:210). The average amount of human bone recovered was only 172.9 g, and weights for all features fell well below modern estimates for the weight of cremated bodies. These estimates, however, are not based on the cremation of partially or fully desiccated bodies, which would incinerate much more efficiently. Possible charnel structures have also been found in some cremation cemeter- ies. For example, McGuire (1992:79-80) suggests that two unusually large pithouses, which appeared to be associated with cremation cemeteries at La Ciudad, a Preclassic Hohokam site in the Phoenix Basin, were used in the funerary or mourning ceremonies. One possibility is that these pithouses were used to hold deceased individuals for a time prior to cremation. Elaborate processes for storing of deceased individuals may not be necessary in the Tonto Basin. The generally dry conditions and low humidity in the basin can result in natural mummification, as evidenced by several Gila phase burials at the Tonto National Monument, which had substantial flesh remaining when they were excavated in 1940 (Steen et al. 1962). Preservation of the body would have required protection from precipitation at open sites; this could have been accom- plished simply by storing them in a structure, and possible evidence of these fea- tures has already been presented. Protection from insects, rodents, and carnivores also would have been neces- sary to delay skeletonization of the body. One way to prevent insect damage would be to wrap the body in cloth, and most interments were positioned in a manner consistent with a wrapped body (Loendorf 1996c). Also, the Hopi appear to have recognized the connection between insects and putrefaction. Mas-totovi is a name given to a greenish blue bottlefly that lays its eggs in dead animals or decaying matter, and interestingly the fly is sometimes linked to witches and other evil creatures; compounds with the modifier stem mas- generally "center around the content 'dead person,' primarily in conjunction with Hopi burial rites" (Malotki and Lomatuway'ma 1987:7).</page><page sequence="27">Salado Multiple Interments 345 Fire also would be an effective means of preserving bodies, especially during colder and wetter periods of the year. Once again, Hopi ethnographic research supports this association. Maasaw is not only the owner of fire, but also consis- tently sits stoking a fire that emits a wave of searing heat (Malotki and Lomatuway'ma 1987:23). It is possible to offer etic explanations for why delayed inhumation would have been practiced. Anthropological theory suggests that ancestral ties (symbol- ized by formal cemeteries) can serve as the basis for corporate group property claims (Saxe 1970:119; Goldstein 1981; Charles and Buikstra 1983:117), and a similar association is found between land ownership and the principal deity of death for the Hopi (Maasaw). Possession of deceased relatives' bodies (the previ- ous owners of the land) would provide a tangible symbol of the basis for a prop- erty claim, and would also provide a not-so-subtle symbol for the source of as- cribed status. This practice may also have provided a mechanism for perpetuating the achieved status of individuals after their death. Put another way, a corporate group could increase its status by maintaining the status of deceased members, especially prominent or important individuals, as symbolized by possession of the dead members' bodies. CONCLUSIONS This investigation has considered the possibility that unusual mass burials at Classic period sites in the Tonto Basin resulted from intentional delayed inter- ment of deceased individuals. It is further suggested that these practices were part of a belief system in which ancestor worship played an important role. Ethnographic, ethnohistoric, archaeological, and theoretical observations have been presented which are consistent with these two suggestions. It is possible that delayed interment was a fairly widespread practice in the prehistoric U.S. South- west that has not been identified, in part, because it was discontinued well before ethnographies were completed and consequently evidence for it has not been con- sidered previously.
