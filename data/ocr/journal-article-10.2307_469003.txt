<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reply to Richard Wollheim, Patrick Gardiner, and Hilary Putnam Martha Craven Nussbaum IRST OF ALL, I should like to express my gratitude to Richard Wollheim, Patrick Gardiner, and Hilary Putnam for their ex- cellent comments. I feel fortunate indeed to have had such perceptive critics. I cannot hope to answer their questions adequately here; I shall simply sketch a response to a few of their most important points. Richard Wollheim's reading of the novel deserves comment-not only because it differs so markedly from mine in its estimate of Maggie, but also because this very fact raises serious issues about the role of literary texts in ethical reflection. For someone might point to this serious disagreement between two attentive readers as evi- dence that a novel such as The Golden Bowl by its nature so under- determines our interpretations that it could never play the guiding role in moral deliberation that I have ascribed to it. There are difficult issues here; I could not even disentangle, much less settle, them without extended discussion both of the novel and of general ques- tions in the theory of interpretation. I simply record here, cryptically and without argument, my belief that any problems of underdeter- mination, and also of indeterminacy, that arise for the reader of this novel arise just as acutely for the reader of a complex philosophical text-for example, Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics-and also, perhaps even more acutely, for the reader of events and persons in a life. The need for commentary is equally great in all. (The Sacred Fount shows James exploring such connections.) It would be a mistake to infer from the difficulty and complexity of all of these tasks that there is nothing that counts as success or truth in each. Professor Wollheim's other major difference with me concerns the boundaries of morality. Whereas I speak of the novel as a part of moral philosophy, he suggests that one of its important contributions consists in the way in which it forces the reader outside of morality and into areas of human psychology that lie beneath the moral strictly understood. The novel helps us to see how inseparable morality is from nonmorality, and thus perhaps to avoid "crude idealizations" of the moral such as are present in many works of moral philosophy.</page><page sequence="2">NEW LITERARY HISTORY (In answering these suggestive remarks I find it helpful to think of the fuller statement of this distinction that Professor Wollheim has given in his William James lectures at Harvard; an earlier account of it can be found in his Inaugural Lecture The Sheep and the Ceremony.) The first thing that must be said is that when I assert and Professor Wollheim denies that the novel is inside of or a part of a "moral" inquiry, we are using the word "moral" very differently. For me, as I said, something will count as a contribution to a moral inquiry if it contributes to our asking and answering of the very general Aristo- telian question, "What is the good life for a human being?" Professor Wollheim associates the "moral" with notions of duty, obligation, and prohibition; many elements of a good and valuable human life- including, it emerges, love and the positive response to value-fall, for him, outside of morality thus conceived. There are, then, many ways in which a reader could be taken "beyond" morality in his sense and still be within it in my sense. But this is not the end of the matter. For I believe that it is Professor Wollheim's view that the novel, insofar as it takes us into certain psychological depths, takes us outside of the Aristotelian question as well. Insofar as we follow Maggie in her revenge project, we are responding from elements in our personality that are blind and deaf to this question and to all ethical questioning. (This is so because of their structure and history; a fuller account of this would require scrutiny of Professor Wollheim's psychoanalytic account of human development.) I do not wish to deny either the existence or the power of such elements; nor do I deny that the novel is well suited to explore them. But I would maintain (speaking now only about James) that the way in which we explore revenge, passion, hate, and blindness here is deeply ethical in my broad sense, since we are continually being asked to see the bearing of these elements on the well-being and fruitfulness of human lives. Even when, as I suggest at the end of my paper, we are ourselves made accomplices in Maggie's blind- ness, we are accomplices capable of recognizing our situation, re- sponding to it, and asking about its significance for our view of what it is to live a good human life. Even when we don't see or feel, we try to see, to write about, just that. Our experience is never severed from our responsible scrutiny. I am very grateful to Patrick Gardiner for his convincing account of the later development of Maggie's aesthetic imagery. His conclu- sion that the aesthetic functions as a positive, as well as a negative, image for the ethical attitude is welcome to me. And he has shown us where we might look for an element of continuity in Maggie's 202</page><page sequence="3">NUSSBAUM REPLY moral development: the very way of attending that is implicated in her earlier failures has with it positive elements that promote her later growth. (This point emerged in our discussion in Oxford; it was, I believe, first made by Mr. Gardiner.) I want to insist more than Mr. Gardiner has, however, on the great difference between Maggie's earlier use of aesthetic imagery and what happens in this later scene. The "fine pieces" of the early period were inert. They did not speak, they did not make claims or demands, they "lay there" in splendor. Finally, they were not anthropomorphic. All these differences be- tween art objects and persons were crucial to the success of Maggie's project. The "painting" in the scene to which Mr. Gardiner refers is a very different sort of aesthetic object. It is active, even aggressive: it "told," it "named to her, as with hard lips, named straight at her, so that she must take it full in the face," it "brought home to her" her responsibility. It is anthropomorphic and makes ethical claims; it demands attention, discourse, and response. In short, it has just the features of persons that Maggie had tried to deny in her earlier aes- theticizing. She may, as Mr. Gardiner says, have aestheticized the moral attitude in her new emphasis on improvisation and creation; but she has, just as significantly, moralized the aesthetic. Patrick Gardiner's remarks about moral conflict show that we have a deep-seated philosophical difference about this matter, which can hardly be pursued well here, either in general or with respect to The Golden Bowl. (It occupied much of the evening's discussion in Oxford.) I discuss my view of the matter (with reference to Greek tragedy) in a chapter of The Fragility of Goodness (Cambridge University Press, forthcoming). Meanwhile, views related to mine have been defended by Bernard Williams ("Ethical Consistency," in Problems of the Self [Cambridge, 1973]), Ruth Barcan Marcus ("Moral Dilemmas and Consistency," Journal of Philosophy, 77 [1980], 121-35), and John Searle ("Prima Facie Obligations," in Philosophical Subjects, ed. Z. van Straaten [Oxford, 1980], pp. 238-59). Hilary Putnam says that morality, as a result of my treatment, "comes off rather bruised and bloody." I reply that The Golden Bowl, by showing how morality lies "in the fell clutch of circumstance," has left it "bloody, but" (I believe) "unbowed." I can see that I need to try to convince Putnam that my evident fondness for Jamesian com- plexity and mystery is not incompatible with, and actually springs from, a deep attachment to morality itself, rules (properly construed) and all. First I need to clear up two misunderstandings. Putnam ascribes to me the view that "novels are the works of choice in 'moral philos- 203</page><page sequence="4">NEW LITERARY HISTORY ophy.' " I claim something much more modest: that if the job of moral philosophy is to work through the major alternative conceptions of the good life for a human being, presenting them to the intuitions of the "interlocutor" for assessment, then The Golden Bowl and/or other relevantly similar works of literature may prove indispensable to that enterprise. This is so because they present more forcefully than do works in other styles certain views on this matter that we should take seriously as alternatives. I add to this the suggestion that these works call upon moral responses and elicit forms of moral ac- tivity that may prove essential to the fair scrutiny of some of the alternatives. "If traditional philosophical texts do not ... call upon all of the[se] abilities, ... this would be a good reason to think that a Socratic theoretical enterprise requires texts like this one for its com- pletion." It is obvious that I am sympathetic to the views that I find in The Golden Bowl; but this is no part of my case. I suppose that even someone who is fundamentally unsympathetic to those views ought to grant that they deserve a fair hearing as we work through the alternatives; and if they receive a fairer hearing in an inquiry that includes novels like this one among its texts, then even this unsym- pathetic person ought to judge it reasonable to include them. To put the point another way: I am not proposing (as some recent attackers of traditional philosophy might) that we replace the works of Plato, Hume, Kant, Mill, and Sidgwick, in our ethics curricula, by the works of Henry James and Proust. I find that idea ludicrous and highly distasteful. These are great and wonderful works whose contribution to the subject could not possibly be replaced by that of the novels. I am only modestly suggesting that we might add the study of certain great novels to these other studies in order to be sure that we are fair to all the alternative conceptions of goodness. The second misunderstanding concerns the phrase "the Kantian account." Putnam speaks of my "references to the 'Kantian account' " and suggests that these references involve a derogatory attitude to- ward Kantian rules. In fact I can find only one passage in my text that mentions a Kantian account, in a context that is neither derog- atory nor concerned with rules. My point there was that if we adopt "the Kantian account" of what moral philosophy is, including Kant's distinction between moral philosophy and practical anthropology, then it would make no sense even to ask whether The Golden Bowl could make a contribution to moral philosophy. Its empirical char- acter would place it, by definition, in a different discipline from the start. I suggested that we work pro tempore with a more inclusive con- ception of what moral philosophy is, and I suggested that the Aris- totelian conception I described would be one that is broadly accept- 204</page><page sequence="5">NUSSBAUM REPLY able. I can add here that it is acceptable, in fact, even to a number of thinkers who are otherwise sympathetic to Kant's ethical views. Rawls, for example, has defended his project of articulating a Kantian ethical conception by arguing that it is a necessary part of the fulfill- ment of an Aristotelian ethical enterprise. He traces his conception of the aims and procedures of moral theory to Aristotle through Sidgwick; and he evidently believes that an Aristotelian view of method and procedure can provide a fair and adequate context for the assessment of Kantian views. Now for rules. In fact, the central argument in my attack on Mag- gie's notion of ethical consistency was that it did not take rules, ob- ligations, and standing commitments seriously enough. It should be quite plain from my reading of the novel that I do not think the "adult" attitude toward morality involves the idea that everything is a matter of "trade-offs." It involves instead the idea that to take a commitment seriously is to regard oneself as bound by it even when it collides, contingently, with another commitment. Maggie's attach- ment to consistency is childish because it leads her to deny or "round" away the conflicting claim. I say that this is morally reprehensible. Let me, in fact, speak of Kant here. Kant, like Maggie Verver, is deeply attached to the idea of ethical consistency. He is also, like Maggie, committed to the idea that nothing the world does ought to be able to cause a person to violate a genuine obligation. The re- quirement that objective practical rules be in every situation consis- tent overrides, for Kant, our intuitive feeling (which he acknowl- edges) that there is a genuine conflict of duties. It appears that our duties may conflict. But this cannot be so. Consistency requires us to see that at most one can be a real obligation; the other is only an apparent obligation, which has turned out, in this case, to be actually contrary to duty. (See Die Metaphysik der Sitten, Gesammelte Schriften, Pt. I, vol. 6 [Berlin, 1907], p. 223.) What I want to say about this is that, paradoxically, it does not take duty and obligation seriously enough. For it says that a contingent feature of the world can cause something that would otherwise have been a duty not to be a duty. This is an odd result for Kant. For it is a deep part of Kantian ethics to insist that obligations are obligations in all circumstances, that a claim does not cease to bind just because of some chance occurrence in the world. I want to say that Kant is un-Kantian, just as innocent Maggie is guilty, when he lets his attach- ment to consistency lead him to deny the conflicting claim as merely apparent. I claim that James's novel shows us how a rigid attachment to the ideal of consistency in conflict situations produces moral eva- siveness and, in fact, moral inconsistency of a deeper sort, for it makes 205</page><page sequence="6">NEW LITERARY HISTORY Maggie unfaithful to some of the commitments that ought to have been deepest and most binding. What would we actually think of an agent who, confronted with two conflicting claims, cheerfully went toward one with no compunction, saying that the other one had just now turned out to be contrary to duty? James suggests, I believe correctly, that we would think this person irresponsible, childish, and even quite immoral. The kind of consistency we want from a moral agent is, instead, the sort that involves sticking by a commitment when it leads into difficulty, even moral difficulty, attending to it and caring about it even when the world makes it impossible to do full justice to it. One thing that Jamesian/Aristotelian "perception" sees, then, is the repeatable features of the situation at hand, features that link the situation to ongoing commitments or obligations; and it sees these even where there is no altogether safe course available. But here we arrive at two further ways in which I wished to criticize Maggie Verv- er's attitude toward rules. First, the repeatable features are not all there is to see in a situation: there are also its special or unique fea- tures-for example, the special wonderfulness of a uniquely loved person. The idea that morality consists only in the application of general rules to particular cases that fall under them does not permit us (permit Maggie) to do justice to the importance of these features. Second, Maggie's early model of deliberation as a matter of bringing already fixed and unbending rules (the hard outsides of the ocean liner) to the occurrent case does not leave room, I suggested, for the kind of surprise or discovery that can result from an honest moral confrontation with a new situation. The idea that a system of rules should be antecedently fixed and should exhaustively determine what we are to see and to count as salient in the new case is incompatible, I said, with the view (defended, I believe, by Aristotle) that ethical experience is an ongoing adventure in which genuine surprise, even revision of one's background conception of the good, are possible. On one understanding of what "practical syllogisms" are (an account sometimes erroneously ascribed to Aristotle), the good agent comes to the world with the fixed decision that, say, "I must be kind to children." The encounter with the world consists simply in saying, "Aha. Here's a child," and then the kind acting begins. I think The Golden Bowl makes a good case for seeing the interaction between antecedent principle and particular perception as more complicated, more two-sided, and also more agonizing than that. So I have three difficulties with Maggie's view of rules: her insis- tence upon consistency even at the cost of denials, her neglect of nonrepeatable features, and her refusal to allow herself to be sur- 206</page><page sequence="7">NUSSBAUM REPLY prised or to discover anything. This hardly amounts to a denigration of rules in general. Indeed, it amounts in one way to a strengthening of the binding force of rules, as we have seen. One of the most fas- cinating and urgentjobs in ethics today seems to me to be to articulate the dialogue between rule and perception in an Aristotelian morality. I think James helps us to begin that task. Works of fiction require commentaries; so do admitted works of moral philosophy. In my reply to Richard Wollheim I suggest that they seem to me, in this respect, to be pretty much on a par. Someone will now be tempted to say, "Oh yes, but you know what I mean. You have to explain what a novel is doing in simpler and more abstract terms. The commentary has got to be clearer and also more theoret- ical than the text; and this is not the case with a commentary on an 'admitted work' of moral philosophy." There are a number of subtle issues here; I cannot possibly disentangle them now. Cora Diamond's comments, however, seem to me to have made an excellent begin- ning. The question to ask is, as she says, What picture does such an interlocutor have of what the world is and what philosophy is? Why should it be evident that simplicity and theoretical abstractness are desiderata in a piece of philosophical writing? Couldn't a text be a work of moral philosophy precisely by showing the complexity and indeterminacy that is really there in human life, and by refusing to make any simplifying theoretical statements? Diamond's reference to Wittgenstein here is illuminating. By saying only what can be said and by refusing to say anything simpler, less storylike, than human life is, the novel does make a philosophical claim (about the human truth and, implicitly, about the limits of theory) that could not simply be paraphrased in a nonnovelistic text. (For such a text can so easily claim, in and by its very style, that complexity is reducible, even if its content denies this.) In my commentary on James I have tried to preserve and not to conceal those features of the text in virtue of which it makes, as I believe, these claims. Some people would say (adopting a narrow conception of philosophical activity) that such a text does not do philosophy, it shows the limits of philosophy. Like Cora Diamond, I am not sure that this is a very deep issue. But since I think of philosophy, in its original Greek meaning, as whatever form of inquiry it is that expresses our love of wisdom and leads us to under- standing of ourselves and the world, I prefer to say that this text, by showing the limits of a certain kind of theorizing, does philosophy. I find Putnam's picture of a philosophy as an (expressive) artistic creation exciting. I worry, however, about a direction in which it could be taken (against Putnam's intentions, I am certain). If, as I 207</page><page sequence="8">208 NEW LITERARY HISTORY think sometimes happens with Nietzsche's use of that image, we be- come convinced by the image that moral theory is all a matter of free play or exuberant, unconstrained making, we will have lost an idea that is, in my view, fundamental not just to moral theory but to any morality whatever: the idea, namely, that there is something there that we are straining to be right about and to express truly; the idea that it does matter, and matter deeply, whether we say this or that; the idea that we are after the truth. Putnam says that more work is needed. And nobody is more con- scious than I am of the incomplete and programmatic character of this attempt, which I call a sketch. I regard it as the beginning of a journey-not on a watertight ocean liner. I hope that Putnam will (like Bob Assingham) continue to bring his Kantian sternness and respect for duty to my assistance as I "paddle" my "bark" (like Fanny) on the "mystic lake."</page></plain_text>
