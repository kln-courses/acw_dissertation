Eskerod, C.-H. Tillhagen, and Laurits Bodker, whose names are not found in the Scandinavian survey. Neither do we hear a word about the Nordic Folklore Institute, now located in Copenhagen and supported by the govern- ments of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland. It publishes annual reports and type-indexes, and provides materials for individual scholars. These remarks do not diminish the obvious merits of the book. Undoubtedly, it is a welcome vade-mecum for a traveling folklorist. If publications of this kind are to con- tinue, it might be appropriate to focus one volume on the most recent theoretical ap- proaches in folklore. Contributions for this could be obtained from scholars in different countries. There exists a lack of information and communication in that field, too. The Supernatural Owners of Nature: Nordic Symposium on the Religious Conception of Ruling Spirits (Genii Loci, Genii Speciei) and Allied Concepts. AKE HULTKRANTZ (Ed.) (Stockholm Studies in Comparative Religion 1.) Stockholm: Almquist &amp; Wiksell, 1961. 165 pp., 2 maps. Sw. Kr. 30:- Reviewed by MARGARET L. ARNOTT, University of Pennsylvania Using an ancient yet neglected theme of hunting lore concerning the "ownership" of Nature, at the invitation of the Society for Research on the History of Religion the Scandinavian scholars held a Nordic Symposium in Stockholm in January 1959. As an outcome of this gathering, we have a collection of scientific essays treating this theme in a variety of ways. The 13 essays are arranged alphabetically according to author, with an introduction by Professor Wilkman of Abo-the motivating force behind the sym- posium-and a preface by the editor. The discussions which followed the reading of these papers at the symposium were not printed but have been transcribed from the recording tapes and have been preserved. Of the thirteen papers, six are in German. The essays in this volume, which is the first of a series in comparative religion being prepared by the University of Stockholm, cover not only Nordic, especially Swedish, concepts but also African, South Asian, Siberian and North American Indian. They encompass the hunter's religious ideology and also some of the more modern Nordic concepts of the house spirit, the mill sprite, church sprites, elves, trolls, and gnomes, and at the same time deal adequately with the linguistic aspects of the subject. For the convenience of those who may wish to consider the exact subject matter included in these papers, the titles are: "The Lativian Forest Spirit" by H. Biezais; "Aranyani and Katukilal. Some notes on the Goddess of Forests in India" by C. G. Diehl; "Literatur, Sage und Geschichte. Ein quellengeschichtlicher Beitrag" by C. M. Edsman; "Some Examples of Popular Conceptions of Sprites and other Elementals in Sweden during the 19th Century" by S. Erixon; ,,Zwei gleich gross machen." Eine nordische Prokrustessage" by J.

Vilkuna.</page><page sequence="2">[65, 1963] 144 American Anthropologist In Europe, especially in Scandinavia, Germany, and Austria, great attention is being given to these and related problems. Two of the papers deal with the problem in North American Indian cultures, which Hultkrantz feels is a field particularly rich and varied, fairly untouched by the cross currents of ideas from higher cultures but with existing conditions of culture and nature which are very distinct. Gosta Kock also touches on the problem among the North American Indians, reflecting upon the influ- ence of the missionary. This volume presents a challenge to and provides an inspiration for folklorists and ethnologists of other parts of the world who might do well to look into this heretofore neglected problem. Loki in Scandinavian Mythology. ANNA BIRGITTA ROOTH. (Reg. Societatis Humaniorum Litterarum Lundensis, Skrifter utgivna av Kungl. Humanistiska Vetenskapssam- fundet i Lund, 61.) Lund: C. W. K. Gleerup, Publishers, 1961. xv, 266 pp., bibli- ography. Kr 30:-. Reviewed by SVEN LILJEBLAD, Idaho State College There can be little doubt that this iconoclastic portraying of an enigmatic figure in the Scandinavian pantheon brings a much discussed problem to a definite conclusion. So far, Loki has eluded the inquiry of the mythologists, notwithstanding an imposing series of monographic works, notably those by A. Olrik, H. Celander, J. de Vries, E. J. Gras, G. Dumezil, and F. Strom. Concepts of Loki's personality held by these writers are strikingly dissenting. With eclectic freedom toward a heterogeneous material and stressing his evil character, most investigators have interpreted Loki as a god of death, cold, and darkness, an enemy of the Asa gods, or as the faithless follower of Othin and Thor. Others have traced his origin to that of a fire demon or a water spirit. Still another type of investigation has emphasized his character of a trickster, a culture hero, or an ancestor of demons. Common to these authorities was the concept of the myths as sources of religious belief and practice. Dr. Rooth treats the twelve myths in which Loki appears as products of a learned literary tradition. She begins by examining each one of them in relation to contempo- rary narrative material with general European distribution. The myths are embodied in prose and verse redactions none of which antedates the 9th century. Records as known to us were made in the 13th and 14th centuries by Icelandic mythographers familiar with the literature of the Middle Ages. For the most part, these myths are based on tales, anecdotes, medieval hero tales, and clerical writings, largely transmitted through intermediary Irish and Anglo-Saxon sources during a period (from the 8th to the 13th century) when the British Isles exerted a strong cultural influence on Scandinavia. The small residue of mythological traits which remains after all the international material is sifted out are the only ones which can reasonably be Scandinavian and constitutive of the original Loki figure. The author finds that stories about Loki as the inventor of the net, by means of which he is caught himself, form the core of this authentic remainder. She traces these narratives to a well-known Scandinavian-Finnish aetiological myth of the first net. Pointing to the facts that Loki and Locke are used synonymously in 16th- century ballad tradition, that locke in medieval Swedish means 'spider' (the only known meaning of the word), and that Locke in sayings and proverbs occurs both as an anthro- pomorphic being and as a spider, the author concludes that Loki originally was the spider-trickster. She supports her conclusion by referring to parallels in non-European cultures. Other characteristics of Loki as pictured in the Old Norse myths are cunning and duplicity but also foolishness and his alternant theriomorphic and anthropomorphic</page></plain_text>
