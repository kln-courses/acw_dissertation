Hope pretended to Len - and to Daemon for that mattdr - that the scarecrow infant which called himself One was a total enigma to him. But this was not the case by any means. 'Mind you," he said to Daemon's grandmother one day when he visited Sorrow Hill,. "it's been a devil of a job. I have had to listen closely to everything Nameless says, I have had to read his gestures, the flicker of an eye in which a volume of texts is stored. .When his eye droops - the sculpted lid of his eye I mean - it is as if the slit that remains tightens a grip on the eloquence of the soul. Anything he says then has tension. The same word or words uttered by another man would probably mean something quite different. There are other tokens, other signals, I have had to take into account... XXZXXi Virtually the lift of a finger making shapes and words in the air became a pen of flesh-and blood writing sentences in Hope's book. The sentences usually began with One. "One is a jester of lost civilisations. t Or - "One pretends one is content to be Leonardo's g*inea pig. Civilisation's disease is a complex matter." In such ways - the lift of a finger, or the shutter of an eye-lid revealing an inner countenance to the soul within the mask or shell or prison of a face - Nameless made his entry into books and drawings and w i c??xxxxx paintings everywhere. Not only into the works of Professor Hope. But into Daemon's poems as well. It was as if each entry was a t-anslation from another language, a withinness t the Word, a beyondness through measures and scales implicit in the body of the Word. Hope had visited Nameless one hundred tims and on this occasion making one hundred and one visits he arrived to find hlis strange, mad friend writing with a finger daubed with ink. He was splashing lines on a piece of paper as an abstract painter throws the paint on a canvas. Hope was fascinated for he read in the tumult of the lines an up-ended series of letters and words as follows - 'One tends to identify with millions &amp;nd millions of tormented people...

Kutzinski VERA M. KUTZINSKI: You have given so many interviews over the years that it must be strange for you to do yet another one. WILSON HARRIS: The funny thing is that I don't like to do them, but I tend to do them nevertheless, with some people. Because there are some people who have this interest, this deep interest, and one gets into dialogue. So I have a few interviews. There is one coming in a book from Liege next month, a long interview with Alan Riach, a Scottish poet.1 I know your deep interest in these issues. KUTZINSKI: One of the things that has frustrated me is that for years I have wanted to write about your novels and I haven't really been able to, not to my satisfaction anyway. I suspect it has to do with the elusiveness of the vision of wholeness or continuity in your fictions. It's there, but it is unstructured, so you're always dealing with partial images. It may sound a bit odd to put it like this, but I think that it's easier to practice partiality when you're a novelist or a poet than when you're a critic. I'm not suggesting this in order to draw the line between literary and critical writing, but because I, for one, often feel handicapped by the temptation to totalize, to pull everything together into a neat theoretical package. HARRIS: I must admit that I have a great admiration for critics working seriously, and I know this is the case with yourself. I spoke of Alan Riach, who is deeply engaged with links between Scottish literature and South American and Caribbean literatures, and this may well be a good sign because it may mean that the critics are at the edge of a far-flung and diverse audience beyond a strict regional or academic model. Many in that audience are not really in a position to see these things, whereas the critic has the equipment to engage with these issues and maybe indicate some possibility, some change. KUTZINSKI: Or at least the need for change. HARRIS: Yes, so I think critics are extremely important. But to come back to your remarks about totalizing wholes, I think this comes from a conviction that people have that there are formidable models which are absolutes. They may not put it like that, but that is the kind of prejudice that obtains. Callaloo 18.1 (1995) 15-32</page><page sequence="4">C A L L A L OO KUTZINSKI: That an absolute model is the only thing that is ultimately meaningful? HARRIS: Yes, so that, for instance, they would see tragedy as absolute. You know, there are many American playwrights who are deeply enmeshed in some engagement with classical tragedy as they try to sense within their own work how tragedy is playing itself through. I feel this is the case with Eugene O'Neill, and with Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller as well. So, obviously, that is a sort of habit. Perhaps Wole Soyinka, in his play The Road, in bringing an African, Ogun partiality, or breach, into the numinous predicament of tragedy, points in another direction, into the "chrysalis of the Word." But the habit is hard to break. It's a habit not only in the mind of critics but in the mind of writers as well who very often restrict themselves out of some sense perhaps of misgiving about their place in the humanities, in the culture, that they don't conform. I'm not saying that they think consciously like this. KUTZINSKI: So it's not a pandering to an audience, it's a more subtle process? HARRIS: I think there is a desire to please an audience, but that audience may have to do with the conviction in the writers' minds, with a compulsive sense in their minds that the audience they're addressing is an audience which is implicated in their own prejudices, in their own biases. KUTZINSKI: Given what many would call the difficulty of your own writing, both your novels and your criticism, one could accuse you of not aiming to please your audience, depending of course on whom you see as your audience. HARRIS: This is always a tormenting question, because I don't write for myself, really. I have this sensation that there is a real audience, but whether or not that is an illusion on my part I do not know. But I have the sensation that there is a real audience with whom I am involved. This audience is strange, is composed of strangers, is not composed of people who are necessarily familiar with each other, and this strange- ness seems to me to have to do with a continuity that comes out of the ancient past. So one is involved with figures who are so removed from oneself, whether it be Homer or Sophocles, and yet intimate, even as one is involved with American Indians, Amerindians, Arawaks and Macusis, who lived in the very country in which I lived, and yet at a certain level they are more remote, not because they were not related to me-some of them are my antecedents-but because one has a sense that you couldn't converse with them without taking into account all sorts of particularities that have to do with the landscape over which they moved, with the rivers over which they moved, with the fact that they tended on the whole to be quite silent, for one reason or another, and all sorts of peculiarities. And yet one was addressed very deeply by their strangeness; their strangeness was intimate to oneself. Also the sensation that one had that you cannot colonize the unconscious. The unconscious can erupt through the conscious and address one in a startling way that strikes at one's prepossessions. So one finds that one's prepossessions, which are so dear to one, are dislodged. My 16</page><page sequence="5">C A L L A L O O dialogue with these people who are very close was like that. It was a dialogue in which I sensed that I was being tested very deeply about the nature of reality, how I viewed reality, and not just by the people but by the landscape, which for a long time people had accepted as passive. I mean there are formidable writers who declared that landscape is a passive creature. But landscape is not a passive creature because it has rhythms, it has complexities, it has dimensions, that address one in terms of all sorts of faculties that one eclipsed in oneself. The landscape, the life of the landscape, would seem therefore to have to do with some mystery of psyche which one shares with non- being. There is a link between being and what one calls non-being, and it may be possible that one's prayers for God could be answered through creatures who appear to be dumb and whose gestures bring an answer to that prayer. In fact their dumbness has to be read in concert with all sorts of engravings upon rocks. For example, you go into the interior of Guyana and you come upon what are known as the Timehri drawings. (One translation of Timehri is "the hand or mark of God.") These inscrip- tions are peculiar. So that if you come upon a man who appears to have nothing to say, it is as if his tongue exists in the rock, or it exists in the bark of a tree which is very old and which has all sorts of peculiar markings on it. The tide has risen, so you can see that on an ancient tree, that at one stage the floodwaters rose and left a mark there, and so on and so forth. His eloquence comes out of a whole body of resources which need to be translated. This, to some extent, has been translated, that body has been translated, but you can never completely translate that body of resources. The dumb creature, then, pushes one into the cavern of oneself in which some other tongue exists in addition to the tongue that one has, the tongue that has been conditioned to speak in a certain way and is locked into a certain kind of tautology. And you begin to share a certain anguish because you know that aboriginal peoples themselves are locked into ontic tautologies: evil is evil is evil, Hades is Hades is Hades-the ancients are locked into these. And then you find that to some extent their decline, their fall, is within you, the way in which these tautologies have afflicted them, and as if they may have something to say to a whole civilization that is now in danger, even though people appear to have a very prosperous summit from which they can look at the rest of the world that seems to exist sometimes in such an abysmal plight. The reasons for this lie very, very deep within the body of world civilizations, and in the peoples who bear this anguish, the peoples who are at the fringes, who are outcasts, so that they are the expendable in that they seem to have fallen out of the race, but they may be ahead of us and they may be telling us something about ourselves. They may be telling us something of what may happen to us if we do not understand what has happened to them. KUTZINSKI: Of course we have our own tautologies, or the same tautologies. We are caught up in similar ways. What you are saying is that there has to be a way of breaking those tautologies and looking to the ancients may provide a way of doing that and dislocate something to change the path into the future. HARRIS:Yes. Not that the ancients can offer us an immediate solution but rather some mysterious evolution of structures of ancient myth within our psyche may alter the 17</page><page sequence="6">CALLALGOO core of ontic tautologies and disclose unsuspected inner/outer dimensionalities that one may call "unfinished genesis of the imagination." KUTZINSKI: In one of your more recent essays, "Adversarial Contexts and Creativ- ity"12, you mention the epigraph to Carnival, which is drawn from Norman 0. Brown's Love's Body. You were talking about it in the context of validating your visions. Tell me more about the relationship between Carnival and Love's Body. HARRIS: That is something that happened with Carnival that happened with some other novels before, such as Da Silva da Silva's Cultivated Wilderness and The Guyana Quartet. The epigraph from Love's Body was chosen after the novel had virtually been completed. I had been presented with that book by Norman 0. Brown himself in California. He came to all of the seminars I gave and made lively contributions. I was happy to have him. When I was leaving, he gave me a copy of his book. When I came back to London, I didn't read it then. I put it away because I was working on Carnival. And when I had virtually completed Carnival, one day I pulled it down for the first time to sort of relax a little bit and came upon that passage which became the epigraph for the novel, but it did not mean that the novel was following that exact line. What I found is the ancient sort of myth here presented of which I knew nothing, of the people in their Vao; I do not know who they are. I've asked people since then, and they do not know, and I have been promising myself to write to Nathaniel Mackey and ask him to ask Norman 0. Brown who they are. At any rate, the myth itself had evolved very subtly in the novel, and if you could recognize it, you could see complications in it. It goes like this, just to have it before us: The wanderings of the soul after death are prenatal adventures; a journey by water, in a ship which is itself a Goddess, to the gates of rebirth. In Vao the newly dead man is believed to arrive before the entrance to a cave on the sea-shore, where he encounters a terrible crab. In front of the cave-mouth is a mazelike design called the Path. As the dead man approaches, the crab obliterates half the design, and he has to restore it, or else be devoured. The Path is the same one that he has trodden many times in the ceremonial dances, and his knowledge of it proves him to be an initiate. After completing the design, he must tread its mazes to the threshold of the cave.3 KUTZINSKI: Wilson, is there any reason why the epigraph as you quote it does not, unlike the actual passage in Love's Body, identify the terrible crab as female? Is that an accidental omission or a purposeful one? Or is gender insignificant here? HARRIS: It is true that the "terrible crab" is identified with "female" in the passage. But this is not consistent with parallels (if I may put it so) that appear in Carnival. Those parallels illumine "memory false and true." The live, fossil proportions of "the crab" range through models of tradition in constellations and in games (hunter and hunted). They apprise us of the mystery of truth that we frame into absolutes (within 18</page><page sequence="7">C CALLAL OO- fallible proportions of memory) at our peril. In Carnival the "wound" humanity endures and suffers, with all species and creatures, came intuitively, by stages and parallels, into a transfigurative focus. Within that focus the totalizing function of the "terrible crab as female" was dislodged and various shared masks and guises that bear upon "the innermost spirit of sex, the spirit of brooding creativity that takes over where nature leaves off."4 But you find, first of all, the prenatal adventure when Everyman Masters dies and becomes Jonathan Weyl's Virgilian guide and then discloses all these things to him. KUTZINSKI: You mean when Masters dies the second time. HARRIS: Yes, his first death is a metaphorical one. And that really breaks a certain kind of status that he had; it breaks a certain kind of storyline, the storyline of the overseer and his dominance, and the whole industrial scene in which he was a prince- figure. That is broken. So he dies one kind of death. He comes to London and he dies an actual death, and he returns in Jonathan Weyl's dreams. The whole question of why one uses the dream, I could never in the past give an accurate reply to that, but I think I can come closer to it now. It is that the dream implies a certain kind of breakdown. There is an element of madness in dreams because of this breakdown. One then is able to look at forces and passions within oneself which are no longer attached to the goals or specific objects of performances. Why should a man, for example, go out into factory day after day and do a laborious job and find the energy to do this? He gets up early in the morning, he drives to his factory. I worked for a while in a factory when I first came to London, I had to earn some extra money, but it was hell. I met men there who had been doing this all their lives. They worked overtime, they wanted overtime, and they worked every day. You could see that they were chained to this. Looking back on it, I realized that this was no ordinary achievement. This called for energy of a rare kind, that this man didn't have to do this. The dream brings this energy into different focus. The energy itself is remarkable, but you don't realize that. KUTZINSKI: We tend to trivialize it. HARRIS: We trivialize it because, you see, of the man's job-well, you know, he's a laborer in a factory. We don't ask ourselves: he's been doing this for twenty-five years, thirty-five years, where does he find the energy, where does the drive to do it come from? Granted, he has to earn money, but even so, there must be more to it than that. Why do people submit (if the word is submit)? What the dream does is to dislodge this energy, and this is why the dream is very important in the fiction I write. Because it's a way of altering the direction in which energy flows. You could see it flowing in other directions. And that is why I want to take the dream into these novels, because what is unbearable becomes bearable. In other words, this energy, if it were left to sweep on its own accord, could be unbearable in two ways: first of all, you would say why all this energy has been wasted; that's one. But the other thing is that the energy may have terrifying proportions in it. And, therefore, the dream to some extent is not an absolute release of the energy. It still gives the energy a focus. But the focus is much 19</page><page sequence="8">C A L L A L O O more diverse, much more complex and the dream can sustain such complexity of focus. Now here is Jonathan Weyl. Everyman Masters comes back, and as he discloses all these things about himself, he takes Jonathan to look at his mother. He takes Jonathan into a house, and there he looks through a crack in the door. He sees his mother at a mirror, and in his child's eyes, his mother is made up of half glass and half flesh, and he is able to look through the glass and see himself as a fetus. He had heard rumors that his mother may have aborted him and at the last moment decided not to do so; you get your prenatal adventure. Now the glass woman also becomes a clue that leads one along into the glass ship in which Jonathan and Everyman Masters sail to Europe. They are in the womb of a glass ship. They look through and they see Christ walking underneath. And then there is another area of the novel where the mother hugs the child, but her body is like the mast of a ship. When I wrote that, I was not aware of this myth of the "ship which is itself a Goddess." But the clues were all there in the novel that made this completely relevant, even though the whole thing had undergone an evolution, changes had occurred in the extremities of the myth, perhaps even in the very nucleus of the myth. One could still recognize it; it was at a certain level, it was not easily recognizable because it had acquired different particularities. Now that meant that the storyline on which the myth rested had been fissured or broken. Therefore, new resources had come to the storyline. So the myth on one bank of the storyline appears like this; on the other bank it seems to me it appears to have changed subtly and complexly as it comes into Carnival. You see, there is a continuity, but that continuity is not to be identified with any absolute structure. KUTZINSKI: It seems to me that you're implicitly linking that continuity with the Jungian collective unconscious. Couldn't one argue that that's a way of trying to structure this continuity? HARRIS: I'm glad you raised that question. In some essays I said that I don't know if the word "collective" is the best word, that one could say "universal" unconscious, but I must make this very clear here. When I speak of the unconscious I'm not only speaking of the human unconscious but of the unconscious that resides in objects, in trees, in rivers, I'm suggesting that there is a psyche, a mysterious entity, that links us with the unconscious in nature, and here again you have polarities to do with energy and passion. So if you have a great storm sweeping across the landscape, we may tend to see the storm purely as a natural phenomenon. Now, in some ancient cultures they saw that as the gods addressing us. But the point is that you can always take the energy of the storm, the passion of the storm, and place it in nature, or you can attempt to place it in some anthropomorphic areas of ourselves. I think that both of those poles are partial, that the energy between those poles may signify some reality that we need to see in such a manner that we don't lose the dimension that goes beyond ourselves, or what we call nature. There may be another dimension in which you could visualize that energy, and if you begin to understand that, and perceive that, then you may be able to address the ways in which cultures have trivialized their activities, have trivialized activities in which so much is used, so much passion and energy and drive is used-to what end? 20</page><page sequence="9">C A L L A L O O KUTZINSKI: Presumably wasted. HARRIS: Yes, wasted. And some of this may come from the way in which we have misjudged the direction of a certain kind of passion, in the ways in which we take the storm as the mirror of something which we identify totally and absolutely with the seed of his lashing at us, or, on the other hand, some eruption that occurs when a man goes out and does something quite hideous, when he goes around with a gun and shoots children, some eruption in himself which is akin to a storm. And this we can't grasp. We tend to locate it as some kind of fatality that we associate with human conduct, and it ends there. This is something tragic, this is something endemic in humanity, the human being who goes and shoots a lot of people, in the same way that the storm is endemic to the sea, or something. And that is how we tend to see this phenomenon. We tend to see it as a fatality. There is a fatality of nature, or a fatality of human conduct. So people speak of an act of God, that is a fatality; and they speak of act of man, that is a fatality. Once we are conditioned by such fatality, tautology becomes the cement of perpetual satire-satire is satire is satire. An authoritarian paradiso of rich, consumer societies may satirize itself endlessly out of guilt perhaps, but nothing changes to bridge the deepening chasm between cultures. An inferno of deprivation embraces starvation in the Third World, drugs and corruption in con- sumer societies, and offers therefore an unlikely but negative bridge between worlds: a bridge that mimics or apes an architecture of cross-cultural creativity even as it confirms a prisonhouse of the body and the mind. KUTZINSKI: A holding cell...? HARRIS:...a holding cell. Something endemic and bleak enters into our conscious- ness, and it seems to me that increasingly our emphasis on moral imperatives is a hollow, one-track realism or postmodernist game that lacks the density of plural meanings. Do you agree? KUTZINSKI: Yes, I do. You're also talking dichotomies that seem to be rigid as the tautologies are. Perhaps one way of exploring this further is to ask you what relation, if any, you perceive between what you call the cross-cultural imagination and a concept such as multiculturalism, which is fashionable these days both in the United States and in Europe? HARRIS: Multiculturalism is a totally different thing from cross-culturalism. It means that you have several different cultures that are really ghettos. Multiculturalism as I understand it means that you have an umbrella tolerance. You have a range of different cultures, but these cultures are not really acting on each other. There is no profound dialogue. They may have to meet each other, but when they act on each other, they seem to act in terms of violence. Let me give you an illustration of what I mean by these poles in nature and human culture, because this is such a difficult thing to discuss, looking at so many complications. In that article I have given you, "The Unfinished Genesis of the Imagination,"5 I take the case of the bow that Ulysses pulls, 21</page><page sequence="10">C CALLALGOO and I'm saying that there is no way in which we can manufacture the same bow. You may build it, you may construct it, we may have all the measurements. But really when you remember that at the time when this bow was used it came from a tree in which the whisper of the wind through the leaves had a peculiar, inimitable echo, intonation, for the ancient Greeks, all of that, the wood that is taken, the kind that is used, all of that was pertinent to the instrument that Ulysses uses. What we know is that it should inform us at some very deep level how precious these raw materials are, that we cannot make an exact or identical bow because we have to see this in a different way, we have to relate to this numinous instrument in a different way. But what we can sense is that in making the construct, in re-inventing the Ulysses bow, we are dipping into resources that you can never translate entirely. And it is from those resources that Ulysses's extension of himself into an instrument, or a vessel, came. Thus you have the trees and the forest and the wind and the music which acted upon him, and you realize that that action on him informed his culture. In the same way, it has to inform our culture. The bow we build, even though it seems to be exact, is a numinous inexactitude, that it is spiritually inexact, that it is the gaps within this inexactitude that give us a window into the world, so that we can then rediscover ourselves as original creatures who have to cope with the resources given to us in the forest, in the wind, in the sea. It is this blend of two poles, one is the world of nature and the other the world of our inventive spirit of genius, the blend that occurs there is such that it directs the passion with which that bow must have been made, it directs it differently for us. Our enterprise is inevitably particularized differently, so we are not locked into the prejudices or biases of the Homeric age. We perceive these as mysterious but partial, yet we see the blend of which I am speaking. And that blend, when it operates in us, apprises us of this strange genius which is at work in the ancient Greek world and which can be at work in our world, provided that it is not locked into a dichotomy in which the two poles become perversely active and mechanically trapped or passive in the way that the man is who goes out to his work in the morning: he goes and works like a puppet and comes back, and that is all you see of him. Nothing else comes into play, nothing else that lifts his craftsmanship out of that frame; his life becomes the life of a pawn, of a puppet. I don't know if I'm putting it as well as I would like to. KUTZINSKI: Let me see if I can translate some of this for myself. One of the things that you seem to be saying is that it doesn't make any sense to separate nature and culture and place them into some kind of dichotomous relationship, that they are really two aspects of the same thing. No, that doesn't sound quite right. That they are really the same thing that we need to look at from different angles? That they are a continuum? HARRIS: They are not the same thing. They have to do with a road that we follow from one area of ourselves into another area. You have one area which we have built which is a human construct, and you have another area, which you may call the natural construct, and you go from one to the other. But that is not altogether what I was saying. What I was saying is that one can leave one area of one's life to go into another area of one's life, and you follow a certain path, and the energies which are used to 22</page><page sequence="11">CALLALOO- take you from one place to the other become less and less transfigurative, unless an explosion occurs and the man who is doing this becomes violent and rebels against this thing. By the same token you have people over in Eastern Europe following a certain course. They were following this course for years and years and years, living in that way, going from their homes to their factories and farms, and then suddenly came this explosion. What I was saying was that this explosion, the explosion itself, has to do with a blend of what seems to be purely natural, and also purely human, and that this explosion can appear to be a fatality. In other words, it happens, and you say that these people have rebelled, that they were bound to rebel, that they couldn't endure this any longer. So it's a fatality. Now, the conjunction of the human energy and the energy in nature, this conjunction is more mysterious than one accepts it. It is something you can never totally pin down, but there may be a relationship between what erupts in ourselves and erupts in the storm or the river, a much more mysterious connection. For example, you know that people, when a storm is coming up, may experience some signal of impending extent, so I am saying that the psyche is not something that you can grasp in absolute human terms, just as the eruption in nature is not something you can grasp wholly in natural terms. There could be a connection here that has to do with some nameless force or passion, some drive. It occasions a deep excitement that comes from the fact that a composition of reality exists which does not conform to any function that we may perform. Such composition is a paradox. It nourishes continuity, it nourishes all ages, but resists absolute institution- alization or seizure. That was the point I was trying to make. An eruption occurs, you can view it as a fatality, it has to happen, you say, because this man was doing his job till at last he rebelled. KUTZINSKI: I guess the L.A. riots are a recent example of that. HARRIS: Yes, and people view that event as a fatality. It had to happen like that. When something like that occurs in Los Angeles, they dismiss it by saying, Well, you know, they're poor people. They're in a ghetto. And that is the end of it. But suddenly you were aware of a force, of a passion, of an energy that may be more mysterious than you think. It may have to do not only with the economic injustices but with an involuntary association with a composition of reality triggered into play through economic and political factors. We tend to box what happens into purely political and economic functions. The profound residue of psychical distress, schizophrenic men- tal illness, and their ominous bearing on the starved and crippled (therefore cata- strophic, eruptive) body of the imagination, are overlooked again and again. We find it easier to box catastrophic upheaval within the body politic into social tragedy or social fatality. We lose the way it may bear on the predicament of an entire civilization, and the necessity for shared responsibilities that begin to test all cultures to the core of self-understanding. Just as I was saying that in the case of the Amerindians who appear to be disadvantaged, their disadvantage is not to be separated from the fate of a whole civilization. They may have a profound bearing on that civilization. They may be telling you a great deal about our failure to perceive the fluctuations of an involuntary 23</page><page sequence="12">C A L L A L O O tide of association that may be taken and perceived in its many-sided and far-flung fabric before it erupts mindlessly almost. It's easy to divide the world into the powerful and the powerless. It's easy to reinforce a linear bias or function until a chasm appears between those who have apparently progressed technologically and those who have fallen behind. Such linear bias is so familiar it seems the wholly natural temperament of history. We grow blind (let me put it like that) to another way of reading reality. KUTZINSKI: Yes, because it becomes invisible for all intents and purposes. HARRIS: That's what I mean by strangeness. That unless one feels a strangeness in oneself, the familiar investment in linear function becomes the fatality of a culture. KUTZINSKI: But there seems to be a tremendous difficulty in, even resistance to, conceiving of different kinds of relationships between such apparent polarities from what we're used to. To push against that habit seems at times to require an incredible act of will, and even as you're pushing against it you feel yourself being pulled back into a powerful inertia that's created by sheer force of habit. HARRIS: You put it beautifully. There is an inertia that has been created by sheer force of habit. Energy that goes into all sorts of things becomes trivialized because it's driven into an inertia, into a frame of powerlessness that may so seduce us it breeds perverse addictions, perverse frames of apparent contentment or happiness. I don't know how you break that, but you can break it partly by explaining to people the unpredictability of the world in which they live, because they can get up in the morning and some disaster can happen, such as the Los Angeles riots. That could happen within the course of hours, so that this habit, this fixture of habit, becomes invalid. Then they look at the world around them, in which things are happening all the time that are running against their desires. Many of them want to earn bounty and money, they want to have whatever is existing out there, but then they suddenly learn that the very climate, the very world in which they live is so polluted that the goals they expect may become invalid. Now, the question is how do you relate these two things, that something that seems solid at this moment and promising becomes sterile? You can only relate these two if you begin to look at the forces that are operating, that are knitting these two together. And you begin to open up these forces in a different way. So that as Anselm, in The Four Banks of the River of Space, makes his journey back, these forces are being opened up in a different way. And his childhood is opened up in a different way. He discovers that his father, who is a womanizer, is a different person from whom he thought his father was. And there is density of association which is profound and necessary at times in dislodging purely linear function in order to bring distant or removed characterizations of history abreast of presences of the moment. Such simultaneity of the past and the present deepens the legacies that act upon us out of the past; it creates (that simultaneity) a different narrative pressure. One is aware of the pressure of a ceaseless quest for understanding in which the energies of the past become an omen of a living continuity native to 24</page><page sequence="13">CALLAL OO- ourselves. As for example, Agamemnon in The Four Banks becomes the myth through which you read the assassination of Martin Luther King, of Kennedy, of Mahatma Gandhi, and you read these because they're all inexactitudes. You can never get the exact thing that happened to Agamemnon, but it is as if Kennedy returns from his war to be killed, Mahatma Gandhi returns from his kind of war to be killed. The same applies to Martin Luther King, and the thing that arrives in here is this: that one then begins to discover that these different people, you know, are in a way driven by-and this may be a difficult way to put it-a dynastic pigment in the unconscious in the sense that out of Gandhi's assassination emerge the Nehru dynasty, the Bhutto dynasty; they are partial dynasties. They come out of that. A simultaneity knits the past and the present together. There is a desire in the Black Americans to have their own dynasty. They may not be able to locate it, but they would like to have it. The Irish tend to lock themselves in their own ghetto. They want their dynasty, too. Now behind all of this there lies some necessity to understand the theme of kingship, of what ancient kingship means now, and of its proportions, its polarities, because dynasty relates to ancient kingship. But dynasty by and large seems, in our world, to be suffocated by killings, by martyrdoms, by assassinations, so we may be losing sight of the royal principle, the density of kingship, which is a principle of service in its extreme tapestry encompassing ancient and modern cultures. KUTZINSKI: Not of domination? HARRIS: No. Kingship should really have to do with some renaissance of service to humanity (kings once fought shoulder to shoulder with the so-called common men) in which you can approach the tasks of a whole community and remain open to the mystery of true authority, not authoritarianism but true authority. KUTZINSKI: But that's not how this process is usually interpreted. HARRIS: There are resources available to us which we may not apprehend creatively, and then these resources become disastrous. They erupt. You see, you can't deny them; you may think that you have eclipsed them because you want to reduce them to a formula. So people, students, want to read books which will not really worry them. They can read them and pass their exam. There is no anxiety, no worry. They're not taxed to read differently. But around them the world could be exploding, and they don't know when it will explode under their feet. KUTZINSKI: Talking about creating anxiety! The fallacy is to think that the way in which you avert disaster, those supposed fatalities, is not by redirecting your creative energy but by somehow trying to explain away discomfiting things, of trying to achieve some measure of control by building explanatory systems, theories without residue. And when you don't have residue, you don't have partiality, you don't have uncertainty. Isn't that the kind of certainty that twentieth-century science is supposed to have delivered and hasn't? 25</page><page sequence="14">CALLAL OO- HARRIS: Except, I believe, in quantum physics. That is why I went to the quantum thing. KUTZINSKI: How exactly have quantum physics affected your writing? I'm thinking, for instance, about one of the four epigraphs to The Four Banks of the River of Space, the one from Nick Herbert's Quantum Reality. Is this epigraph evidence of another instance of retrospective validations that you experienced with that novel? And how does the idea of quantum reality tie in with the concept, and practice, of infinite rehearsals? HARRIS: I was drawn to quantum mechanics because it seemed to validate (in a modern perspective) imaginative work in which I had been engaged for a long time even as some ancient myths-of which I knew nothing-validated re-visionary evolving processes through "intuitive clues." I have discussed this matter in The Radical Imagination and before that in The Literate Imagination.6 The notion of "parallel universes" is curiously pertinent to The Four Banks, and that is why I employed an epigraph from Nick Herbert's Quantum Reality. I have been influenced by quantum mechanics but was heartened-when I came upon it-by a realm of visionary probabilities (if I may put it so) which, I understand, are quantum stuff or quantum substance. I have attempted, for instance, to trace this in my analysis of the "noose" in Palace of the Peacock. The innermost content of the "noose" undergoes subtle, intuitive alterations to create a juncture between the inferno and the paradiso even as it breaks the Dantesque separation between pagan (or pre-Christian) and Christian worlds. All this thickens in the mystery of continuity, for which there is no absolute model, and the creative necessity for dislodged linear function or bias. Well, when you read a book, you can read forwards and find certain images, and then you have to read backwards because those images oscillate backwards and connect with what has gone on before. In other words, if the images were total and absolute, you would read forwards all the time. But then you come to an image and you realize that it links up with what has gone before. So the reading requires a kind of looking back as well as looking forwards, and it is where these images relate to each other and combine and open, conceal and release, that you come closer to some kind of wholeness, but the wholeness can never be structured, never be seized. The moment that it is structured and seized it becomes another partial image. I find that many people who made the greatest noise about politics and protest are conditioned by a kind of narrative which goes forward all the time, so that their protest really and truly is invalid because the thing they are protesting against has them in its grip. So even though they think themselves emancipated, they're prisoners. KUTZINSKI: Yet they don't, for the most part, seem to realise that they are. HARRIS: But, I mean, it's obvious. They're helpless in the face of the events that are occurring around us. In other words, their lives go toward an ornament, an orna- mented existence which is removed from density of association. 26</page><page sequence="15">C CALLALOO- KUTZINSKI: Yes, that's right. The result of all this is ultimately a leveling out, an absence of passion, not a happy medium but an incredibly unhappy middle ground of indifference at best and cynicism at worst. But to come back to what you are calling density of association. This reminds me most immediately of your reading of Faulkner's Intruder in the Dust in The Womb of Space. I hadn't read that novel in years, and your commentary made me excited again about Faulkner. It gave me a new angle on his work, and a new respect for it. HARRIS: I'm glad. It's a peculiar situation in Intruder in the Dust that with the man who is buried, Vincent Gowry, you can see the connection with vodun. KUTZINSKI: I have to admit that that connection never occurred to me before you mentioned it. HARRIS: And it's there though, isn't it? I don't even know whether Faulkner saw that. But what struck me as very remarkable is that Faulkner, who lived in the South amongst Blacks, may not have seen this connection. And yet he could enter in it because of the intuitive revisionary dynamic in his fiction. His fiction, then, can address us differently, and that shows that Faulkner is a writer of genius. Because, you see, he is an agent of a remarkable, fantastic process which allows that to happen. And that is a novel which has been attacked. At the end he loses momentum and succumbs to regional and local prejudice. KUTZINSKI: He imposes closure in the form of a predictable moral ending. HARRIS: Yes, and all of that is interesting. Readers should be excited by that, because that is the world in which we're living. The Haitian people who are coming across the sea and are being sent back, you see, and here is Faulkner who is connected in a way with one of the most peculiar rituals that they have. So that at a certain level you can see that ritual quite differently in the way it surfaces in the biases of his Southerners. KUTZINSKI: That's right There are other texts that this brought into clearer focus for me as part of an historical field: for one, Alfred Metraux's book, Voodoo in Haiti, which you mention and which was published about ten years after Intruder in the Dust. But also, and especially, the anthropological work of Zora Neale Hurston on both the South and the Caribbean. That, too, is relevant to reading Faulkner. HARRIS: Well, you know, Faulkner's genius lies in the fact that he did see that the deprived people he saw, one had at some level to get inside of them to understand their peculiar kind of insanity. Unless you could begin to do that, you couldn't dislodge them from a world which had already killed them in some degree, in themselves. Now, I am aware of those things to some extent from within my own novels. I don't approach it quite like that, I mean, getting inside of the deprived person in the way Faulkner does. But what I do see is that you have to dislodge people from 27</page><page sequence="16">C CALLAL OO- the way in which they have been anchored in the world. You have to do this creatively. You have to see this with passion and insight and with a whole range of imageries that help you to do this, because if you don't do it, this is going to explode at some stage. A character in Resurrection at Sorrow Hill (the new novel on which I am now working)7 believes he's Montezuma. His name is Monty, the Venezuelan, and he has suffered a breakdown. Because of his breakdown he descends into the fabric of civilization, past and present, and is afflicted by a desire for revenge. That descent brings him to the frontier of well-nigh unendurable sanity that he needs to cross. I sense that characters in Conrad and Faulkner came to that frontier but never crossed. Perhaps the time is ripe-despite every discouragement-for characters, within the genesis of imagina- tion, to cross. I hope so. KUTZINSKI: Yeah, what doesn't happen in your writing is that you pull back at the end. But even in Faulkner, especially in Intruder and to some degree in other novels such as Absalom, Absalom!, there's almost a recognition of "Oh my god, what have I done!" which is immediately followed by the impulse, perhaps imperative, to set his house in order again so that things like Gowry's corpse don't become too disturbing. HARRIS: Precisely. At the end Faulkner himself is appalled at a certain level by what he has moved into. KUTZINSKI: It's almost as if he'd moved in too deep or had seen too much. HARRIS: But this is a thing that writers have to wrestle with, this kind of terrifying moment. And they have to go on wrestling with it, because if they don't do that, they will discard their best work. They have to wrestle with it and stay with it because at times they have a desire to destroy it all. Because it all seems so disturbing or challenging, or it seems to raise questions that become so uncanny and that cannot be answered immediately, that the instinct is, Oh, get rid of it! So Faulkner in a sense got rid of part of it by flattening it out in the end. But still, he witnesses to the frontier that needs to be crossed, and that is what constitutes his genius. But most readers, alas, are committed more to the end of the product, the end of Intruder in the Dust. They want to be buried in that way that Faulkner rationalizes in the environment of the South. Can they enter into Dostoyevsky at a deep level if that is the way they think? No. They may read Dostoyevsky just for some kind of classical retreat which bears on his work. But there is an aspect to Dostoyevsky, there are so many questions to do with conscience. What has to do with conscience is the way that Raskolnikov, who aped Napoleon in Crime and Punishment-who thought himself above the law-was being pushed into an imperial cul-de-sac. And there was no immediate answer to this. Tolstoy, who tried to answer it, did it with large gestures-"Free the serfs! I'll do this, I'll do that"-and he never answered it. And I don't know that Goethe did, genius that he was, in wrestling with Faust all his life. But that is how literature deepens the imagination. Dostoyevsky is now relevant again. To some extent you see that people like Gorbachev and Yeltsin are figures in Dostoyevskian drama. Because what you have had recently in Russia is the eruption of disturbing conscience. Gorbachev 28</page><page sequence="17">C CALLAL OO- wanted to proceed by deliberate stages, he didn't realize what he was opening up, the chasm of conscience. Yeltsin, on the other hand, saw necessity in the nemesis of conscience. How do you bridge, how do you get a link between necessity and love? Necessity for a long time has allied itself either with authoritarian cults or the use of more violence. It's necessary to kill, it's necessary to slay the czar. If love on the other hand tends to ally itself with some ornament to make the ornament immune to densities of association, then love becomes a property of greed. The link between necessity and love remains suspended.... KUTZINSKI: The really dangerous thing is that we are losing our ability to create such a link, that our imagination is becoming, as you put it in The Womb of Space, illiterate. Would restoring such a link amount to transcendence, in a neo-Hegelian kind of way? Are partialities, then, gateways to transcendence? HARRIS: As I understand it, there is no formula for such a link. It needs to be discovered differently in every century. It isn't, in my view, a question of Hegelian thesis and antithesis but of true oppositions that miraculously, or paradoxically, nourish and sustain each other by deepening each other's premises of mind into profound self-confessional fabric. Such deepening resists the reinforcement of partial institution into dogma, into an absolute. Such reinforcement becomes a death-in-life whereas deepened self-confessional fabric may still open death-in-life into a gateway into transcendence or potential transcendence. For example, at the end of Four Banks, Penelope discovers that her husband the hero, the war hero, had actually died metaphorically as a boy when he had almost been run over by a car. She had actually said to her mother, "Simon is dead," and they were alarmed by this. But Simon, from that moment on, was addicted, whether he knew it or not, to pursuing the man who had nearly run him over. His career is addictive pursuit of "everyman" scapegoated into his "killer." So when he goes on the battlefield, his metaphorical death and scapegoated killer energize his heroism. Now, you discover Penelope's courage, her kind of strange courage that differs from his heroism. All her life she'd shrunk away from this knowledge, she had retreated from this knowledge, understandably. And then this self-knowledge erupts when she sees an ancient, fossil child in a pit with ornaments that mirror the present-in-the-past, and something happens that brings about a wholly different reckoning of her life. In other words, she could have gone on living all her life, applauding various heroes to whom statues are put up, without any insight whatsoever into what constituted innermost courage to plumb meaningful deceptions that make for perpetual feud. But if, at this time in the last decade of the twentieth century, we're not prepared to look at such things, when will we look at them? Because this century has been an appalling century. Look back across this century. People must know truly. KUTZINSKI: Perhaps the temptation to totalize I mentioned earlier is a way of trying to force the process of which you're speaking. HARRIS: I don't think there is any harm in making occasional totalizing statements. 29</page><page sequence="18">C A L L A L OO Because this is a difficult thing that you can't rid yourself of entirely. It is true that this whole matter of how you cut the ground from under what appears to be a total model can be very far-reaching, because the extraordinary thing is that it can bring into play dimensions that we may be missing entirely. Take, for example, the noose that appears in Palace of the Peacock. That noose helps to give different visualizations of context. It may seem simple now to look back on it, where the noose that appears is just the noose that hangs a man, and then you have the noose that is a kind of constellation or lightning belt in the sky, and this bears upon theories of hubris in Donne. And then in the end you have Donne sustained by the noose which should strangle him, and that is when you get a link between the inferno and the paradiso because he is in a position then to see the hell on earth that he has helped to create. So you don't get a totalizing of the noose. You begin to see that the noose is a noose is not a noose. You break the tautology of the noose. But I didn't perceive that I was doing this at the time. But I do mention it in my introduction to the second edition of the novel, because this is an extended introduction. But that's the thing about totalizing. One totalizing noose would not have acted like that, would not have worked in that novel. A lot depends on how you explore the imageries. KUTZINSKI: And on how you explore their metamorphoses? HARRIS: Yes, because that bears on the whole landscape. There is no absolute waterfall: there is the waterfall that is a physical entity; there is the waterfall that the ancient Amerindian woman, Mariella, perceives. How does she perceive it? She perceives it as a memory of a people who came along from the Bering Straits to arrive in the South Americas. She seems to have some grasp of it there. In this perception the waterfall is almost a kind of precipice down which her people descended. And the crew in the boat responds to a rhythm and music that is terrifying yet ecstatic. They respond upon the lip of the precipice to orchestrated memories as if in these lay the genesis of sacrament, sacrifice, and music. KUTZINSKI: I wanted to ask you something about science fiction in this context, in part because you refer to it in another introduction, that to The Womb of Space. You wrote there: "Science fiction makes no bones about the status of writers such as Jules Verne and H.G. Wells whose space fantasies are now technologically respectable." Clearly, your own work is not so much concerned with technology in that sense, but would it strike you as at all as appropriate, or perhaps suggestive, to read a novel such as The Infinite Rehearsal, part of which is, after all, set at a time in the future, as science fiction. HARRIS: In this book, the thing that you have, I wouldn't say it's science fiction. What I was saying is that Dante's universe is a universe of fixed stars, whereas you would think of the light year as the seed now of divine comedy; and when one perceives it like that-in scanning an object far out in space-the lighted star one sees could be the shadow of an object that has vanished perhaps a million years ago. In that sense the object is susceptible to alterations, to live, fossil particularities, to invisible and visible 30</page><page sequence="19">CALLAL OO- proportions within itself, beyond itself. It is as much "space" as "solid." Its origination tests the imagination in artistic and scientific terms. It is ungraspable solid, ungraspable architectures, curvatures, of Shadow and Light. May not the Big Bang exist within such a context of light-year genesis comedy to excite fiction into stitching a garment of "space" upon, for instance, Robin Redbreast Glass who meets Peter and Emma within the tunnel of the light years in The Infinite Rehearsal? Robin is both dead and alive in a light-year context of the imagination. One is suggesting that the history of the universe, the mystery of the genesis of stars, as of life, affects planetary and terrestrial character. In this way the fatality of violence may open itself to a generation of creative and re-creative forces aligned to simultaneous light and shadow, visible and invisible bodies. Such simultaneity breaks a familiar pattern of feud to lay bare untapped resources for therapy and healing between oppositional parties and bodies. The narrative of The Infinite Rehearsal reflects this complexity in a way that straight science fiction, as far as I know, does not. The narrative also reflects, I think, a series of differentiation within obsolescence and fertility, youth and age, landscapes, riverscapes, seascapes, skyscapes, in order to undermine the reinforcement of what is partial into incorrigible absolutes. Incorri- gible absolutes sow perpetual violence. KUTZINSKI: Could you explain more why this may be more pertinent to a female figure? Also, in your article in Temenos, you refer to Amaryllis, from Carnival, as a Beatrice figure that "has acquired the particularities of numinous sexuality." What do you mean by "numinous sexuality"? I'm also interested in how exactly Emma validates Amaryllis? And what about Penelope? Does she validate both of them? HARRIS: Amaryllis in Carnival is a Beatrice figure. Jonathan Weyl is a Carnival twentieth-century Dante in correspondence with Amaryllis. Everyman Masters is the Carnival Virgilian guide who returns, after his death, into Jonathan's dreams. The seed of light-year comedy in The Infinite Rehearsal (the second volume of the Carnival Trilogy, the third is The Four Banks of the River ofSpace) validates Everyman Masters as both dead and alive. The link between Amaryllis and Emma in The Infinite Rehearsal was not planned. It emerged intuitively as I have explained, with some care, in the article in Temenos 13: The notion of "numinous sexuality" is not sprung from strict logic. Rather, it has its roots in what a critic, discussing these three novels in The Listener, called "magical imponderable dreaming."8 I interpret this as a sense in which the characters float and breach linear bias or storyline function. They acquire a lightness of heart (however burdened by the sorrows and pains of waste and age). That "lightness" is a resource of numinosity or spirituality. You ask about Penelope. Penelope applies to The Four Banks. In that novel there are several queen-figures, plural figures who sustain the burden of inner queen-ship, so to speak, as an omen of re-visionary potential within imageries in texts of being. The seed of a tapestry that never totalizes itself is the uncanny burden of Penelope's passion as I perceive it in Homer. The extremities of that tapestry reach everywhere to margin- alities in past and present civilizations within the Caribbean, Guyana, and the South 31</page><page sequence="20">CALLAL OO- Americas. This area is known as part of the Third World but, in my view, it is a cross- cultural web of civilizations, pre-Columbian residues, Asian, European, and African perspectives from the Old World, so to speak. It exists therefore upon a measureless extremity of plural ages and, as a consequence, when one perceives the wretched economic predicament prevailing there, the threat to the environment, the rainforests and the rivers (all this reflecting a global malaise), I find that a peculiar necessity arises to interrogate the very building blocks of the dominant civilization to which one is subject. I have attempted to do this, in some degree, as an imaginative writer, in response to the questions raised in this interview. Perhaps I could have said more on the South American and Caribbean echoes, rhythms, incantatory voices that greet the silent ear within the fabric of the English language and subtly, complexly, change the language in which one writes. I have, however, spoken of this in one or two previous essays. Those who are interested may want to read "The Fabric of the Imagination," a keynote address I gave on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee conference of the Association for Commonwealth Literature and Language Studies in 1989, which has now been published by Dangaroo Press in a volume carrying conference papers.9 Thank you, Vera, for your keen and profound interest, and for the stimulating questions and issues you have raised. KUTZINSKI: I thank you, Wilson, for your time and your generosity.
