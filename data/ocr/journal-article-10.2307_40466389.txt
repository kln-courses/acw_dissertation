Nuckolls Abstract. - The concept and perception of voluntary action develops through systematic violations of intuitive cognitive as- sumptions. It bears a resemblance, therefore, to concepts Pascal Boyer calls "religious." However, Boyer understands the devel- opment of concepts as a purely cognitive process, and neglects the processes that give rise to emotional attachment. This article argues that the cognitive account must be supplemented by a theory of the emotions, and suggests that "attachment," as John Bowlby understood it, frames and constrains the development of concepts such as "action." Ethnographic data from India are used to test the hypothesis that action concepts develop first and foremost in relation to the experience of emotional attachment in early childhood.

The focus of this article is voluntary action, that is, the subjective impression associated with the notion that one is the agent of one's own acts. To say that one did something on the basis of an intention to act is usually taken for granted. However, it is not at all clear how an action is actually planned and executed, how a subject becomes conscious of intending to act, or why, in certain circumstances, one feels that actions are directed by forces external to the subject. The position advanced in this article is that the concept and perception of "voluntary action" develops through systematic violations of intuitive cognitive assumptions. It bears a resemblance, therefore, to concepts Pascal Boyer calls "reli- gious." Boyer suggests that superhuman agencies - the essential characteristic, he says, of all reli- gious systems - possess features that are salient and memorable chiefly by virtue of their power to violate natural ontologies (Boyer 2001b; see also Lawson and McCauley 1990). In other words, we grow up expecting certain things to happen, like "things fall when dropped," and these de- velopmentally prescribed intuitions become our "ontologies." We fashion our gods by imagining how these expectations can be violated, e.g., "gods float, hover, fly, and otherwise act unconstrained by gravity." One of these so-called natural ontolo- gies, to extend the Boyer hypothesis, is agency. If it is natural to assume that human actions are voluntary and proceed from the exercise of will, then religiously formulated concepts violate this assumption by postulating the existence of beings who control all of our actions. That is the kind of intuition-violation that makes superhuman agen- cies, from Christ to Krishna, salient and memo- rable, and their cults transmissible from generation to generation. The problem with this hypothesis is that Boy- er and his colleagues1 generally do not consider emotion, and thus neglect the relationship between action and the desire for attachment. This is an old problem in the social science, the result, probably, of the fact that cognitivists and psychoanalysts typically do not talk to each other and the fear that each side means to swallow the other whole. Still, could an account that combines cognitive insights 1 Atran 1998; Boyer and Walker 2000; Pyysiäinen 2001; Whitehouse 2000.</page><page sequence="2">412 Charles W. Nuckolls into category development and psychoanalytic ap- proaches to the emotions be proposed? The answer to this question begins with a sim- ple observation. The human child both wants, and needs, the availability of action directed from the outside, mainly the parents (Ainsworth et al. 1978). At the same time, what Freud called the primary narcissism of the child - the feeling that actions originate in the self - is strong, and persists into maturity, albeit increasingly subject to the con- straints of the so-called reality principle. The point is that if the developing mind is predisposed to view human actions as self-directed, i.e., volun- tary, this assumption is not simple or of a piece. That is because we grow up wanting different and even contradictory things (Cooper, Shaver, and Collins 1998). As children and adults, human beings desire both attachment and autonomy, and these competing desire powerfully infuse the per- ception of actions, voluntary and otherwise. What is the link to childhood concepts of agency and action? One popular notion is that the child basks in unchallenged narcissistic grandeur, especially early in life when he views external reality is essentially of an extension of the self. The other notion holds that the omnipotence felt by the child is constantly battered, first by the mother (who does not necessarily respond when bidden), and then by everyone else. Finally it gives way, replaced by increasingly mature understandings of the relationship between the doable and doer, and reinforced by the ideals of ego autonomy and independence. But these views are incomplete and misleading for several reasons. They assume that the process of development is unidirectional, with the force of change in one direction only - toward the "ideal of reason," to use Kant's term. A more likely hypothesis is that the direction is multiple, and the forces at work not in complete synchrony with each other. Factors relevant to the development of the intuitive assumptions of agency remain mixed and confused, not only in childhood but throughout life. The counter-intui- tive assumptions that make up religious ideas of agency are therefore not of a piece, nor are they re- ducible at any point to only one natural and unitary ontology, as the Boyer hypothesis might suggest. There could be several natural ontologies, based on multiple and conflicting childhood-derived con- cepts of agency and action, and all penetrated by the desires and frustrations of development. In what follows, I will examine the development of the concept of voluntary action and explore the implications of this concept for the study of agency in a South Indian fishing village. The Nature of Voluntary Action The concept of voluntary action is typically un- derstood in three senses. All three offer possible foundations for a theory of action, but all three are problematic. Why do you think you act volition- ally, when so much of the evidence points in the opposite direction? This line of thinking reaches its culmination, perhaps, in Prinz' s assertion that the concept of free will cannot be incorporated in an empirical psychological theory (Prinz 1996; see also Jeannerod 1997). But to understand why debunking voluntariness still falls short, we must consider the three senses in which the folk psy- chology of voluntariness is usually understood (see Proust 2000). The first is the feeling of will association with the action. The second concerns the causal origin of action, that is, an action is "voluntary" if its cause is endogenous and accessible. The third involves higher-order states of the agent relative to the first-order intentional content of the action. As to the first, "will," it might be assumed that an agent acquires this awareness through percep- tion of activated motor representations. But the agent may know which action he is performing while being wrong about the way he is perform- ing it, and vice versa. Or the agent may identify an action through its goal and through specific movements used to reach it, without being able to identify the author of this action. As to the second, endogenous causal locus, the agent cannot, on the basis of the signals received (e.g., efference copy, perceptual reafferences), tell whether he has done the action deliberately or not. The signals in question do not discriminate, in and of themselves, between actions originating in the agent and in the environment. As to the third, voluntariness as a second-order property of actions, this refers to the distinction between acting and asking one- self whether or not one is right in acting. The conclusion that one could have acted differently reinforces the sensation of voluntariness, but this is purely a representational feature of the action once it has been performed. It does not refer to the executive capacity to act or not act voluntarily, and, therefore, has no bearing on the question of voluntariness as such. All of this, and more, can be granted to those who argue that voluntary action is immaterial to the origin of action itself (see Libet 1985). In- deed, cultural anthropology joins the debunkers of agentive voluntariness in the anti-Enlightenment project of the last century, at least in this sense. As psychology has restricted and narrowed the Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="3">Toward a Cultural Psychology of Voluntary Action Beliefs 413 domain of free will to perceptual systems and brain functions, so likewise anthropology has tak- en control away from the agent and invested it in "culture," "social structure," or "world system." Instead of debunking agency, however, a more basic question can be asked: Why do we worry about it the first place? For make no mistake, our project is motivated by worry - or, farther, by the fear and the fascination, deep down, that we are not in control of our actions even as we act to debunk theories of voluntary control. We are clearly in the realm of the emotions, whether we like it or not. The question addressed below, then, focuses directly on the developmental origins of the ques- tion "why worry about it?" and uses a combined approach - linking the cognitive anthropology of religious concepts with developmental antecedents of emotional attachment. What Are Natural Ontologies? "Ontology," as cognitivists (like Boyer) use the term, refers to the intuitively grasped relationships between cause and effect. When one speaks of natural ontologies, their postulation and violation, the model of the mind advanced assumes that exis- tential assumptions follow from the observation of perceived regularities. "Things fall from a height" or "objects are continuous in time" are examples. The mind records these regularities, and whether or not this capacity is innate or task-derived, the process itself unfolds in orderly succession from earliest childhood. There is nothing terribly novel in this view. What is new is the hypothesized relationship between intuitive natural ontologies and the development of religious concepts. The Boyer hypothesis states that the developing mind violates naturally observed and associated regulari- ties, and this induces conceptualization of superhu- man agencies, the basis of all organized religions. To follow Boyer, how might the cognitivist account of voluntary action work? Here is one possibility. In early development, a child experi- ences the world as the center of that world, but with limited ability to exercise control through his own motor operations. Intuitively, then, the child would develop a construct of the world near- ly devoid of voluntary action. But that does not mean the experience of voluntary action is absent. On the contrary, as the child matures he violates the assumption of nonvoluntariness by construct- ing, and responding to, images of willful agency. Huge creatures with immense supernatural powers - these are stuff of childhood fantasies, and the primary raw material from which toys marketed to children are made. Nor does it stop there. At the same time the outside world becomes populated by images of fantastic superhuman agencies, the inner world undergoes a similar transformation, and the child attributes to himself deep or hidden powers. He thinks the world revolves around him. This sometimes goes by the name of "childhood narcissism." Notice what we have here: the developmental origins of both the assumption of outside control (nonvoluntary action) by superhuman agencies and the assumption of complete volitional control (vol- untary action). The opposition between the two is as natural as their origin in human development, and the emotional basis of the anxiety that lies at the root of our very interest in the question. Thus, to extend the Boyer hypothesis, the argument is as follows: the child constructs images of self and world that are at variance with the experience of action and control, and these images develop salience accordingly in two directions simultane- ously - toward images of little voluntary control to images of superabundant autonomy. Let us review the Boyer hypothesis. Develop- mental cognitivism holds that the common proper- ties of culturally postulated superhuman agencies, of the sort found in all religions, derive these properties from systematic violations of intuitive assumptions.2 Boyer hypothesizes that religious representations (to be defined as such) always postulate the existence of superhuman beings that violate intuitive assumptions about the existential processes associated with persons, artifacts, ani- mals, or plants. Spirits and ghosts are commonly represented as inten- tional agents whose physical properties go against the ordinary physical qualities of embodied gents. They go through physical obstacles, move instantaneously, etc. Gods have non-standard physical and biological quali- ties. For instance, they are immortal, they feed on the smell of sacrificed foods, etc. Also, religious systems the world over include counter-intuitive assumptions about particular artifacts, statues for instance, which are endowed with intentional psychological processes. They can perceive states of affairs, form beliefs, have intentions, etc. (Boyer 2001b: 46). One might concede this point but at the same time ask, what makes a violation of intuitive assump- tions attention-demanding rather than simply im- plausible? Boyer limits representability to counter- 2 Boyer 1987, 1993a, 1993b, 1994a, 1994b, 1996a, 1996b, 1996c, 1998, 1999, 2001a, 2001b. Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="4">414 Charles W. Nuckolls intuitive assumptions, yet other assumptions seem to be equally well remembered. How, then, does one account for them? Finally, if all counter-intu- itive assumptions are equally memorable, why are only some (out of all that are possible) recurrent? The Boyer hypothesis does not recognize, and cannot theorize about, the emotionally complex origin of the assumptions described as "intuitive." It misses the most salient of these assumptions by neglecting emotional attachment and the conflicts resident in deep cognition. It is the violation of these assumptions - as natural as any Boyer describes - which explains the development of propositions and anxieties about voluntary action. The most important natural expectation violated by religious propositions is the expectation that early emotional attachments, formed in childhood, will continue forever. The expectation is almost always thwarted in normal development, since childhood attachments cannot continue if adult autonomy is to be achieved. Is it possible to have it both ways - attachment and autonomy? As Boehm (1989) points out, the paradox of attachment and autonomy is probably inherent in primate evolution, and there is good evidence that the ambivalence it causes is not confined to hu- mans. Tensions among satisfaction quests might even have an adaptive significance, in that they prepare the organism to respond more flexibly in multicontingency environments (Campbell 1965). Therefore, if Ingold (2001) and Plotkin (2001) are correct, and evolutionary processes must be considered in the development of social construc- tions, we should focus on the development of attachments, the conflicts that arise, and the am- bivalences that result. This leads, inevitably, either to encounter with Freud or to an avoidance of him that pointlessly stunts and limits a cognitive theory of voluntary action beliefs. Toward Rapprochement To construct a theory of voluntary action belief, we need to start from scratch, in what amounts to a basic understanding of how the mind develops concepts of itself and its relationship to the outside world. The purpose, as I suggested earlier, is to come at the issue of voluntary action via human development without neglecting the crosscultural universal that action beliefs typically split between two conceptions - the first that our actions are always controlled from outside, and the second that our actions are never controlled from outside. The development of these beliefs is one and the same with the development of a belief in superhuman agencies, and, therefore, in addition to being developmentally derived, action beliefs are also inherently religious in Boyer' s sense of the term. How can cognition and depth psychology op- erate together, and is it possible for us to discuss them using a common vocabulary? Let us posit the existence of a repertoire of relational schémas which contains archaic components, many formed in childhood, that can never be erased. Such early schémas of self and others are constrained by ma- ture concepts of self which contain and integrate immature self schémas. Nevertheless, in a kind of parallel processing, earlier forms continue an unconscious appraisal of current events, possibly following primitive association and the logic of the "primary process." Unconscious relational schémas, however, tend to conflict. Either they represent mutually unful- fillable desires, or the desires they represent are opposed by mature thought and culturally norma- tive demands. If higher order cultural knowledge structures are accessible only by activating lower ones in the dynamic unconscious, then higher or- der structures probably reproduce in their form and function the conflicts of the lower order relational structures. In principle, there is nothing in this proposition at odds with the cognitivist account, for as Boyer remarks, "adult representation . . . seem to become more complex by gradual en- richment of principles that can be found in the pre-schooler" (Boyer 2001b: 59). The difference is in the nature of the principles, and the extent to which these bear the imprint of early and am- bivalent attachment to one's caregivers. Where does irresolvable conflict ultimately come from? The most likely hypothesis is that it is a natural outcome of human development in the representation of attachment. Maturing hu- man beings both desire to retain and desire to reject attachments to their primary caregivers, and this generates conflict. At this level, unconscious relational schémas produce ambivalence and the need to deal with it - or in psychoanalytic terms, defend against it. Cultural knowledge structures, including beliefs about voluntary action and su- perhuman agencies, come into being which both reproduce conflicts and attempt to resolve these ambivalences, in a mutually reinforcing way. In short, our perceptions of action (voluntary and involuntary) could be based on the inevitable de- velopmental conflicts of action orientations and their attachment correlates. To prove this, it must be shown, first, that the cognitive unconscious is Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="5">Toward a Cultural Psychology of Voluntary Action Beliefs 415 conflicted and that conflicts have their origin in the nature of relational attachment; second, that attachment conflicts give rise to relational schémas that inform the construction of voluntary action beliefs; and third, that such beliefs exist crosscul- turally, and that they might, therefore, be universal. After considering the first two requirements, we will move onto the third, drawing on ethnographic material from India. First Step to a Theory of Voluntary Action: Transference and Core Conflict Relational Themes Understanding the properties of mind most rele- vant to a psychological understanding of religious propositions - including the apparently universal belief that superhuman agencies violate human agency - depends on a central assumption. The assumption holds that thoughts and ideas can have an active influence on people's minds even when they are not conscious, and sometimes precise- ly because they are not conscious. To the first part of this statement most cognitivists and neu- rophilosophers will agree. No one claims that the assumptions violated by supernatural beliefs are conscious assumptions open to inspection by those who hold them. That is the point of calling them "intuitive." As to the second part of the statement, that exclusion from consciousness is actually vital to religious propositions, this is more debatable. Here I am arguing that unconscious conflict be- tween relational schémas is fundamental to the development of a belief in superhuman agencies - and by extension, to the experience of voluntary action - because such agencies represent and par- tially resolve the conflicts that arise in relation to conflicted childhood attachments. In other words, we both desire and reject beliefs in voluntary action, and we do this because of conflicts over attachment that arise predictably and universally in the circumstances of human social development. Even if developmental conflicts exist in child- hood, it must still be shown that these conflicts continue to influence adult relationships well into maturity. Is there evidence that relational patterns shaped can be applied, or "transferred," to present relationships? Freud (1958) described transfer- ences as "stereotype plates" or representations of early interpersonal relationships that shape and in- fluence current ones. On the surface, this is to sug- gest no more than what the literature on psycho- logical "priming" experiments has already demon- strated - that we tend to perceive new people based on mental representations of significant others in the past. Notice that one need not cite case studies in order to provide evidence for this point. In fact, the most important experimental work has been done, not by psychoanalysts, but by cognitive experimentalists like Lester Luborsky. Over the last thirty years, Luborsky and his colleagues3 have developed a method for abstracting interpersonal relationship patterns that appear in patient narra- tives during psychotherapy sessions. Typical nar- ratives are about father, mother, brothers, sisters, friends, bosses, and the therapist. Luborsky devel- oped a method for analyzing these narratives in terms of their repeated basic constituents, which he calls a "Core Conflict Relationship Theme." The CCRT describes the relationship patterns and conflict in terms of three components: wishes, needs, or intentions toward the other persons in the narrative, as expressed by the subject; expected or actual responses from others; and responses of self. Within each component the types with the highest frequency across all relationship episodes are identified, and this combination constitutes the CCRT. Luborsky and his colleagues found that important themes, because they had been shaped early in life, would tend to recur, making for a powerful transference effect.4 First, on the number of transference patterns, there seems to be one main relational theme (just as Freud predicted). Averaging across one sam- ple, for example, the main wish was judged to be present in 80% of each patient's narratives, whereas a secondary wish was present, on the average, in only 16% of each patient's narratives (Luborsky, Crits-Christoph, and Millon 1986). Moreover, there is strong evidence early in treat- ment that 60% of patients who relate a narrative about the investigator describe a pattern that is similar to a theme evident in narratives about a significant other (Connolly etal. 1996: 1220). One could object that psychodynamically oriented ther- apy probably tends to elicit this kind of response, and thus skew the results. But the same result is ev- ident in patient narratives from nonpsychodynamic treatment settings (Connolly etal. 1996: 1220). Second, on the consistency of the theme over time, investigators compared CCRTs scored from sessions early in treatment with the same patient's CCRTs scored from sessions later in treatment, about one year later. Considerable consistency 3 Luborsky 1976, 1977; Luborsky and Crits-Christoph 1998; Barber and Crits-Christoph 1993. 4 See also Bond, Hansell, and Shevnn 1987 and Cnts- Christoph et al. 1988. Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="6">416 Charles W. Nuckolls over time was detected (Luborsky, Crits-Chris- toph, and Millon 1986). This suggests that rela- tional schémas are strongly encoded, and increases the likelihood that when established in childhood they remain active well into adulthood, shaping and constraining new relational information. Third, on the question of themes' early origins, the hypothesis states that there should be a parallel between the relationship pattern with the therapist and the one with early parent figures. Luborsky and his colleagues compared CCRTs scored from narratives involving a memory of an interaction with an early parental figure versus the overall CCRT score from all other narratives. A high degree of similarity was evident for early memory of parents CCRTs paired with the same patient's overall CCRT.5 Now, it could be argued that since Luborsky and his colleagues have not done long- term studies, the hypothesis of early childhood origins remains speculative. This has always been a problem with research that purports to demon- strate the validity of psychodynamic processes. But that is changing, and work in the development of attachment styles provides strong evidence that patterns of childhood associations do constitute templates for adult relationships.6 Transference, in short, is an ordinary fact of life, and Freud was right. Even Boyer implicitly concedes this point, when he acknowledges that "a whole domain of ritual action is based on assump- tions that transfer properties of live organisms to a non-living natural object" (Boyer and Walker 2000: 52, emphasis mine). But what remains to be considered is the question of why in the case of relational transferences its origins are for the most part repressed, and its outcomes in consciousness so varied and different. Here we must focus not only on transference, but on the nature of the relationships shaped early in childhood. The Second Step: Core Conflicts and Attachment Theory Simply put, "attachment" refers to the relationship between infants and their caretakers, and according to John Bowlby, constitutes part of universal hu- man endowment. Attachment theory is essentially a theory of the microprocesses of development that 5 See Luborsky, Crits-Christoph, and Millon 1986; Barber and Crits-Christoph 1993. 6 Brennan and Shaver 1998; Hazen and Shaver 1987; see also Feeney and Noller 1996. emphasizes the daily interactional exchanges be- tween parent and child and the developing internal working model of the child (Bowlby 1969, 1973). Attachment theory shares with contemporary psy- choanalytic theories a shift in the conceptualization of the unconscious - from a repository of repressed instinctual wishes, to a structure comprising rep- resentations of self, or object, and of prototypic interactions between the two. The emphasis on unconscious representations is most clearly ex- pressed in the centrality of the concept of internal working models, similar to the core conflictual re- lationship themes above. Bowlby notes that people may have more than one internal working model and suggests that different working models may conflict with each other. This fact is crucial to the developing of belief in supernatural agencies. Observational data reveal that attachment to particular caretakers is recognizable at around six months of age and appears to be fully developed at one year. A significant attachment figure (usually the biological mother) serves as a secure base for the infant, a place where the child can seek refuge and from which begin to explore the envi- ronment. Attachment behavior is behavior that has proximity to an attachment figure as a predictable outcome and whose evolutionary function is pro- tection of the infant from danger. Such behavior is not confined to human beings, of course, and the fact that it is found among most primates is strong evidence for its adaptive significance. For example, Harlow's classic study of cloth-covered and wire-covered "surrogate mothers" (Harlow and Zimmermann 1959) demonstrated that rhesus monkeys require secure attachment in childhood in order to develop normally. The importance of clinging contact with the mother, not only as a behavioral prerequisite for the infant that was at least as salient as nursing but also as the basis for the development of a secure base for subse- quent exploration of the environment. Hinde also focused on the normative development of mother- infant relationships in rhesus monkey (e.g., Hinde and Spencer-Booth 1966). The consistent finding throughout the history of this research has been that mother-infant relationships in Old World mon- keys and apes involve common behavior patterns, follow similar sequences of developmental change, and appear to be subject to the same set of influ- ences, all of which provide empirical support for the basic tenets of Bowlby' s attachment theory. Bowlby assumed that mothers were usually the primary caregivers, but recent research demon- strates that infants and young children can es- tablish relationships with more than a single in- Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="7">Toward a Cultural Psychology of Voluntary Action Beliefs 417 dividual (neither Bowlby nor his colleagues ar- gued otherwise). From the nature of attachment, it follows that dyadic patterns of relating are more resistant to change than individual patterns because of reciprocal expectancies. In general, the more the infant's relationships to such individuals or objects prior to separation resemble that of the typical mother-infant attachment, the more closely their separation reactions follow the prototypical pat- terns previously described. Thus the relationship between infant and primary caregiver generates a template, used to understand (via transference) fu- ture relationships in adulthood. There is no reason to think that these relationships necessarily involve only people. Via the mechanism of transference, described above, such relationships are mapped onto gods and goddesses, spirits and ghosts, and, probably, all of the other supernatural agencies of interest to Boyer. If one is starting from what every child experiences, then attachment patterns and their symbolic transferences surely rank as high as the perception of solidity or continuity which Boyer considers the bedrock of the intuitive ontologies later flouted by spirit beliefs. The Third Step: Conflict in Attachment and Its Vicissitudes in Action Beliefs Now we come to the conflicts inherent in trans- ferred attachment patterns. These, too, are in- evitable. Human infants are primed to seek out a primary attachment, and in most cases this at- tachment is to the mother - a bond mediated by intimate physical contact (Spiro 1997). The assumption is that this contact will continue, but the assumption must sooner or later be violated, as the child individuates and the mother withdraws. This is a universal process, and no exceptions have ever been noted, although the method and outcome of this transition vary between social groups be- cause of the different values placed on emotional fusion and autonomous individuation. From the beginning, these different valuations play a direct role in the process, making it wrong to assert, as early psychoanalysts did, that human development is the same everywhere or subject only to minor variations. This is probably where psychological anthropology makes its biggest contribution. At the same time, it is misleading to assert, as some cultural relativists have done, that the process is infinitely variable or unconstrained by develop- mental urgencies. Actions beliefs and assumptions are the cor- relates of attachment. The assumption of volun- tary action, in this view, is simply an extension of the assumption of individuality that arises in relation to the child's development of autonomy. However, the assumption is fraught with emotional ambivalence, since autonomy opposes the desire for attachment. Attachment, in other words, is the source and origin of the assumption of nonvolun- tary action, and of the belief that outside beings or agencies control us. A quick example from American culture will show how it works. American childrearing (especially in white mid- dle-class families) generally pushes children to early individuation.7 Parents strive to inculcate greater autonomy in children, and reward them for display of individual achievement and accomplish- ment. "My child started . . .ing" (fill in the blank with the relevant skill, from walking to talking to playing an instrument), is the usual way parents make judgments about themselves and others, as they compare early acquisition of autonomy skills (Kakar 1978). Such skills may or may not be important in themselves. But as markers in the development of the supreme value - autonomy - they are crucial, and children who do not measure up are singled out for special remediation or thera- py, not uncommonly involving prescription drugs. So, which comes first, the early development of individuation or the cultural value we call "indi- viduality"? If the question seems to be of the chicken-and- the-egg variety, it is: there is no point in assigning priority to either one, except in one sense. All chil- dren must achieve some degree of individuation from their primary caretakers, but the extent to which this true - and the meaning assigned to it - is dependent on cultural values (Spiro 1984). Once established, the value of individuation selects for and prefers parenting styles which encourage the development of personal autonomy. Now, there is another side to this process. No one would argue that "independence" is the only value American culture seeks to maximize. There is also the value of home and community, of shared dependency, and common purpose, and this value also finds expression. American cultural values contradicto- rily emphasize both individuation and dependency (Bellah etal. 1985; Raeff 1997), and people must try to balance them or, if they cannot, to adjust to the conflict that accompanies the inability to choose. There is, therefore, a dialectic of contra- dictions, developmental and cultural, that is mutu- ally supportive and continuous (Nuckolls 1998). 7 Bellah etal. 1985; Choi, Nisbett, and Norenzayan 1999; Hsu 1981. Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="8">418 Charles W. Nuckolls Since action beliefs are the correlates of in- dividuation and dependency, we should expect to find that attitudes toward action, voluntary and involuntary, follow accordingly. Studies by attribution psychologists, from Heider (1958) to the present, provide ample evidence that this is so.8 Among other things, "attribution" is a study of causal explanation: when something happens, where is the perceived locus of control - internal to the agent or external to the agent? It is easy to manipulate the perception by subtly changing the context, so that, for example, the subject who attributes control to himself will attribute it to the environment when the context shifts from "praise" to "blame." But the interesting observation, for our purposes, is the conflict that results when subjects perceive (or are forced to perceive) the contradic- tion between the two. Nowhere was this more amply demonstrated than in the famous (or infamous) study of the authoritarian personality by Milgram (1974). He found, surprisingly, that 65% of his subjects, ordi- nary residents of New Haven, Connecticut, were willing to give apparently harmful electric shocks - up to 450 volts - to a pitifully protesting victim, simply because a scientific authority commanded them to, and in spite of the fact that the victim did not do anything to deserve such punishment. The victim was, in reality, a good actor who did not actually receive shocks, and this fact was revealed to the subjects at the end of the experiment. But, during the experiment itself, the experience was a powerfully real and gripping one for most partici- pants. (Milgram' s experiment has been repeated in Australia, South Africa, and in several European countries. In one study conducted in Germany, over 85% of the subjects administered a lethal electric shock to the learner.) The experiment did not end, however, with these results. Ever since, controversy has continued, not over the experiment itself, but over the extent to which we misperceive the voluntariness of our actions. Is this not an index of the ambivalence that results from grow- ing up with two different and sometimes opposed action orientations? Of course, the degree to which people can be "bothered" by the Milgram exper- iment varies, but I take the fact that Americans are bothered by it, as much today as when it was first reported, as a strong indication that we remain highly conflicted on the sources of our own actions, especially when those actions are ethically questionable. 8 See Jones and Davis 1965; Kelley 1967, 1973; Lewis and Daltroy 1990. Cultural patterns like these are interesting, but Boyer is right when he says that the purpose of his theory is not to explain the particularities of religious beliefs. To adumbrate a series of partic- ularistic illustrations, therefore, in the manner of most ethnographers, does not constitute a strong critique of developmental cognitivism. That is why cognitive psychology and neuroscience generally ignore cultural anthropology, and why, one sus- pects, the discussion of voluntary action is gener- ally not informed by anthropological critique. The critique must be able to state that the relevant prop- erties of superhuman agencies are better explained in universalist terms using a different theoretical framework. By "relevance" I mean transmissibility and memorability over generational time. These are the criteria Sperber holds up as basic to the en- durance of a set of beliefs. We must take as given the cognitivist point of departure in their insistence that these attributes demand explanation. What does an anthropological study have to do in order to be relevant to the study of action? It must somehow touch on the three conceptual issues already discussed: transference, attachment, and ambivalence. Not only that, but it must also address the finding that cultures do vary in terms of how much or how little emphasis they place on attachment. Finally, there must be some atten- tion to how ideas about action get reinforced in everyday practice. A South Indian Case Study The case to be described resists the criticism that it represents only a particular instance because it exemplifies tendencies that are widely distributed across many social groups. It is equivalent, thus, to Boyer' s study of the Fang, except that the processes I call attention to concern the nature of attachment, its relationship to ambivalence, and the salience of religious propositions. My basic point, to set the stage, is that attachment is a fundamental property of intuitive assumptions, and that its vicissitudes in terms of our emotional ar- chitecture set the stage for a variety of beliefs, including beliefs about the sources of our own actions. Specifically, the case study exemplifies the tendency to view mothers (and by extension, all women) ambivalently, as providers of succor and destroyers of male potency. This, it will be shown, is a direct result of the conflicts of attachment, something all human share. Certainly the South Indian case is not unique. The contrast in images of the female is found in many places (see Spiro Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="9">Toward a Cultural Psychology of Voluntary Action Beliefs 419 1997) including Greece (Friedl 1967), Java (Geertz 1961; Jay 1969; Brenner 1995), Spain (Gilmore and Gilmore 1979), Portugal (Hollos and Lies 1985), France (Rogers 1975; Rapp 1975; Segalen 1983), Italy (Cornelisen 1976) and southern Eu- rope generally (Saunders 1981), among the Kafyar of Nigeria (Netting 1969), the Swahili of Mombasa (Swartz 1982), and the Mundurucu (Murphy and Murphy 1974). Like most societies, the Jalaris of South India (a Telugu-speaking community of the southeastern coast) postulate the existence of superhuman agen- cies that violate a number of intuitive assumptions. Such agencies cannot be seen in ordinary waking experience; they never die, or if they do, usual- ly come back to life; and they have the power to move objects at a distance. There are other assumptions they could violate, and no doubt if the Jalaris wished to, they could enumerate them. For example, the spirits defy gravity and move through solid objects, but one would have to elicit this information; the Jalaris would not volunteer it, and indeed, to most Jalaris of my acquaintance, it would seem ridiculously trivial to point it out. So why are some intuitions selected for systematic violation and reference and not others? This should be at the heart of the question, if, that is, Boyer and the other cognitivists are correct in proposing in- tuition-violation as the engine of religious concept formation. And how do we know that violations are important in constituting supernatural beings, rather than simply incidental trappings - descrip- tions, that is, attached to superhuman agencies only as a consequence, not a cause, of their postulation? Starting from the observation that Jalari spirits violate some, but not all, developmentally expect- ed intuitions, we can, in the manner of Boyer, explain some of their attributes. For the purposes of this account, in fact, we can accept the whole of Boyer' s explanatory hypothesis. What we cannot explain, however, is the fact that the Jalaris always and invariably define these spirits as "mothers." This definition is by no means unique to the Jalaris, and a similar belief is one of the most widely en- countered facts of anthropological fieldwork. From the fact that they are mothers, all of their other powers and attributes derive, including some of those considered "violations" of developmentally intuitive assumptions. Mother goddesses nurture, as real mothers do, but they also punish and kill. They are sexually voracious, unlike real mothers are supposed to be, and they can take control of living human bodies through possession. From the perspective of explanatory social science, which is more important: the fact that Jalari spirits vi- olate cognitive assumptions of physical regularity (which they do), or that they are all mothers, in relationship to whom ordinary living people are like children? The Jalaris posit the existence of a variety of spirits, most of them female, known collectively as ammavallu or "mothers" (Nuckolls 1996). These spirits possess all the qualities Boyer and Sper- ber (as well as Lawson and McCauley 1990) say they should, fulfilling the criteria for supernatural agencies who defy intuitive conceptions. These are supposed to endow them with, to use Boyer' s phrase, "attention-getting" attributes, which also explains their memorability and transmissibility across generations. It is curious, however, that with exposure to so many other similarly posited agencies, including those of mainstream Hinduism (not to mention Christianity and Islam), the Jalaris show remarkably little interest in incorporating most candidates. This is not true across the board, however. Twice in the recent past new goddesses have arrived in the village, both times accompa- nied by epidemic diseases. In both cases, it was the disease (smallpox and cholera) that got people's attention, and when they reflected on its origin, they inferred the intervention of mother goddess. The Jalaris associate terrible calamities, and dramatic events of all kinds (good and bad), with divine females classified as "mothers." Goddesses are binary, made up of two aspects, one malign and the other benign. Sometimes goddesses do good things and sometimes they do bad things, but predicting which they will do is impossible. They are fickle. Nevertheless, one must act toward them as if their behavior could be influenced, and that means giving them regular offerings of good things (meat, new clothes, and occasionally alcohol or even marijuana). People regularly forget to do these things, and so, when a goddess attacks and punishes them by inflicting disease, they say it was because she felt neglected. But would it have made any difference if they had made the offerings in the correct amount and on time? The Jalaris doubt it. Thus, the Jalari cosmos consists of divine beings, which are alternately (and unpredictably) good and bad, and of human beings who both love and hate their gods and act toward them accordingly. Ambivalence of this sort is characteristic both of the goddesses themselves and the people who worship them. The goddess is good and bad; peo- ple love them and hate them; no one is sure what to do, only that something must be done. When new calamities befall, as during the epidemic diseases, people interpret events according to the schema just described. It is shot full of conflicted images Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="10">420 Charles W. Nuckolls and emotions, and this, I will argue, is related both to the circumstances of Jalari childhood and to the structure of Jalari cosmology. Moreover, ambivalence is not merely something "added on" to a supernatural template already constituted by other means. This is where my account differs substantially from Boyer's. A psychoanalytically informed model of development is better than the cognitivist model at this level and for this purpose - in short, it explains the features of Jalari goddess beliefs that are most salient to their construction and transmission from one generation to the next. An interesting case in point is the vocabulary concerning "possession," that is, the belief that the goddesses can temporarily inhabit a human consciousness and invest it with new purposes. In a sense, this is where confusion over the courses of human action (voluntary or involuntary) is most accurately realized in Jalari culture. The observer is often struck by how often the question, "Is he acting on his own or is it the goddess?" comes up in conversation. The vocabulary of spirit pos- session is strongly physical, with references to "holding" and "handling." It has often seemed to me, in listening to the Jalaris describe possession experiences, that I was listening to a description of the actions of a parent toward a small child: the picking up, the handling, the directing are all highly reminiscent of the way parents treat their children. A Jalari parent, in fact, expects children to exercise little control or direction on their own part until an age Americans would con- sider very late.9 Even then, the demonstrations of independent initiative and personal responsi- bility American parents love to praise are almost wholly absent. Is it possible that the vocabulary of possession in Jalari culture represents, through transference, values and attitudes originally asso- ciated with the relationship between mother and child, and thus support the hypothesis that psy- chodynamic mechanisms mediate language forms and cultural constructions (Nuckolls 1996)? The answer is that it does. On the one hand, a boy is drawn by memories of his mother's nurturing (far more long-lasting and intense in India than in the West) to idealize the feminine. On the other hand, fear that the mother may reject him or worse, exploit him for the fulfillment of her own sexual needs, compels him to constrain the feminine, to keep its power to envelop him under control. This constitutes what Luborsky and his colleagues term a core conflict relational schema - a pattern formed 9 Kakar 1989; Kurtz 1992; Nuckolls 1996. in childhood that becomes a transference template for understanding future relationships. It is not unique to South Asian societies, but it is present with special prominence. Let us assume, then, that conflict in the nature of the mother-child relationship - the conflict over attachment - exists and that it is unresolvable in any permanent sense. This is consistent with what we know about child development in Hin- du India (Kurtz 1992), but follows consistently from what Bowlby and other attachment theorists would predict. How, then, do people deal with the ambivalence that must result? It is not the same everywhere, obviously, and India there is a culturally patterned response. Professional posses- sion-mediumship offers one culturally sanctioned solution, differently symbolized for the men and women who undergo the experience. Ambivalence in the maternal relationship resolves itself among the men in possession by goddesses, a role which normatively allows certain men to immerse them- selves in a nurturing feminine role identity and at the same time to control that identity through the practice of possession-mediumship. The position of the women who become possession-mediums is similar, but reversed. Wanting sons is natural in a culture where fulfillment of a woman's role is contingent on the production of male offspring. But in having sons, a Jalari mother must eventually acknowledge their loss to a wife, who will supplant her, and (South Indian culture) to a set of affines who become competitors with her for her son's attention and support. Under some circumstances, ambivalence in the maternal role - between want- ing mature sons and knowing that their maturity means some degree of disaffection from her - is intensified and then resolved in the experience of possession by her own dead sons. As a medium, the mother regains total control over her son, whom she incorporates as her permanent tutelary spirit. The son never grows up; he can never leave; and he can never be alienated (Nuckolls 1996). Resolution of cultural ambivalence in the re- lationship of sons and mothers is thus possible in different ways. The first way is through sym- bolic transformation of the son to make him less problematic for the mother. The second way is through symbolic transformation of the mother to make her less problematic for the son. Male pos- session-mediums resolve the ambivalence in favor of the son. The "son," as it were, recovers the mother through his own symbolic transformation and then completes immersion in a female persona which becomes (for him) a controlled object of devotion. Female possession-mediums resolve the Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="11">Toward a Cultural Psychology of Voluntary Action Beliefs 421 ambivalence in favor of the mother, who then recovers the son through a process of reabsorption into herself. In both cases, the significant other in the mother-son relationship is returned and simul- taneously relieved of its ambivalence-generating nature through symbolic transformation into an inalienable possession as well as into a source of divinatory power. Although these possession expe- riences are best exemplified in professional medi- ums, the same dynamic is to be found more gen- erally, since possession is something most people in Jalari culture experience at one time or another. To be "caught," "come to," or "got down upon" by a possessing spirit called "mother" is to refer to a relationship that has its origins in childhood. This is no simple thing, because all goddesses - like all mothers - have two aspects: one benign and the other malign. This is one aspect of the ambivalence. If the possessing goddess is in her benign form, and the experience pleasant and useful, then the "mother" is nurturing. Her purpose in possessing is to do good. If the goddess is in her malign form, and the experience of possession painful, then the "mother" is angry. Her purpose is to punish and inflict pain. Through regular worship and occasional (male) animal sacrifice, people aim to control the goddesses and insure that the form they most often reveal is the benign one. But they always forget to perform these tasks, with the result that the goddesses become angry and attack. There are probably many reasons why people forget to make sacrifices to the goddess, but deep down, there is ambivalence. Villagers need the goddess, but they fear she will envelop them, and the fear makes them want to shun her. Doing so directly, however, is too dangerous - and in any case, one should only express devotion to the goddess. "Forgetting," therefore, while not exactly deliberate, is one of the few means available to express hostility to a supreme being. Seen in a wider context, the relationship between goddesses and devotees is no less problematic and generative of ambivalence than the mother-son relationship, but the transactive language of worship at least affords some measure of action. One can curse the goddess for her failure to provide sustenance; think of her as either nurturing or punishing, encouraging one and limiting the other; and even imagine sex with her in the appropriate idiom of worship. Of course the goddess never ages or dies, so the relationship can be prolonged forever. When Jalaris speak of possession by the goddess, using the vocabulary of mother-child interaction, they have transferred the latter and transformed it into the former, where the conflict it generates can be managed in a religious idiom while at the same time retaining its ambivalence-generating power. What we see in this example is that religious propositions violate intuitive emotional structures in two ways, first by asserting that the model of early caregiving will continue forever, even though it cannot without putting at risk the development of autonomy, and second by claiming that the model will not continue, even though the development of secure attachments in adulthood depends on it. Religious propositions of the kind cognitivists consider fundamental are violations of develop- mentally derived models of attachment, but since these models are conflictual, religious propositions both represent and attempt to resolve basic contra- dictions in human experience. The expectation that childhood dependency will continue, however, is only half of the matter. It is matched by the equal and opposite assumption, common to children, of personal omnipotence - almost as if to say, "I am completely dependent on you, but it is by my own will that this dependency exists." The two assumptions arise mutually, and bring each other into being, so we should not be surprised that the conflicts of omnipotence - of completely voluntary action - are as fertile a source of religious propositions as the ones already discussed. In fact, they are all intimately related. The child's dependence on or independence from the mother is mirrored by his or her perceptions of natural agency - sometimes high, sometimes low, and always in conflict with each other. The intuitive assumption of continuing childhood de- pendency, in short, is related to the concept of action, which posits limited voluntarism on the part of the self, while the intuitive assumption of childhood omnipotence is related to the concept of action which posits completely self-willed vol- untarism. It is the conflict between the two that gives rise, at least in part, to the special salience of action to the understanding of human conduct, and to the realization of this salience in the formation of religious propositions. All of this may seem far removed from the Boyer thesis and the theory that religious propo- sitions systematically violate intuitive naturalistic assumptions. But it is not, for the simple reason that concepts of independence dependence, volun- tary and involuntary action, all covary. Religious propositions clearly involve statements about ac- tions, and the characteristics of superhuman agen- cies, if Boyer is right, violate actions deemed natural for human beings. That is what makes them memorable as well as transmissible through time. My revision of the Boyer hypothesis asserts Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="12">422 Charles W. Nuckolls that these assumptions are not unambiguous, but conflicted: a certain amount of paradox is probably natural to them. Chief among those assumptions is that actions should be increasingly self-directed with development. This is a human universal. All humans develop from a state of greater depen- dency to a state of greater individual autonomy. How cultures play on this universal is another matter. Conclusion The history of thought in the West (especially Eng- land and France) usually takes contradictoriness to be a weakness or failure. To be at variance with what also desire could be taken to be symptomatic of the irrational or the insane. Against monism stands a long tradition of dialectical thinking, es- pecially prominent in Germany, which questions the existence of things in themselves in preference for complex relations, and the interaction between these relations and the perceiving consciousness. Paradox is embraced and understood as the pow- erful dynamic that drives and develops systems of knowledge, both those that are conscious and those that are unconscious. The view advanced in this article supports the dialectical view, and holds that many features of culture - including the concept of voluntary action - result from structural contradictions deep in the development of attachment. These contradictions are insoluble by design. One of the most basic assumptions violated in human development is the assumption that the maternal relationship will continue in its earliest form. At first the child is in close physical proximity to the mother, and the sole object of her affection and attention. Then the child is weaned, and privileged position it once enjoyed must now be shared with others. The expectation that the relationship would continue forever is shown to be false, and the child must grow up knowing that its most basic expectation about the world is not inviolable. At the same time, the wish itself is contradictory: the desire for continued dependency on the primary attach- ment figure is opposed by the desire to develop some degree of autonomy. As Spiro notes, "it is a psychological truism that children's experientially acquired conceptions of their microsocial world of the family form the basis for their initial cognitive orientations to the macrosocial world" (1997: 150). Somehow the contradiction between early experi- entially derived expectations and their violation in normal development must be resolved, even if it is the form of a paradox that acknowledges no permanent resolution. Religion as a "culturally constituted defense mechanism," to use Spiro' s (1965) phrase, offers one route to resolution of conflicted attachment wishes. The "mother" deity, as we have seen, represents and at the same time partly resolves the conflict over childhood-derived wishes for depen- dence and autonomy on the part of the child as well as the mother. Conflicted wishes are transferred to the image of the goddess, and in this form they are dealt with through the conventional and transactive language of worship. The fact that such wishes are never fully and completely realized, of course, partly explains the memorability and trans- missibility of such a belief system. Nevertheless, they promise resolution, even if at the same time they make that impossible. This is a paradox, but as I have written elsewhere, culture itself can be understood as built up out of paradox, a complex interlayering of problems that cannot be solved (Nuckolls 1998). Dependency is different from, but related to, the contradiction between action as voluntary and action as involuntary. Humans develop with op- posing orientations, one that subsumes voluntary action in dependence on a powerful other, and the other that seeks to undo dependency and replace with autonomous self-will. Flouting these expec- tations is basic to the symbolic construction of superhuman agencies as cultural objects. After all, that is what gods are supposed to do. But there are several ways of doing this. On the one hand, the gods can be imagined as all powerful, and thus as determining our actions from one moment to the next without the intervention of human will. On the other hand, humans exercise agency when they identify with the gods (as in spirit possession, an almost universal cultural phenomenon) or when they "forget" to do homage to the gods. I have suggested that the conflict between these orienta- tions - between wanting and rejecting voluntary action - is framed in the language of attachment, and that what we are really talking about, deep down, is ambivalence. As subject as this process is to cultural definition, its motivational well-springs are still to be found in the nature of the ma- ternal bond and in the movement away from it as the human child develops. What "bothers" us, then, about voluntary/involuntary action is that it resonates with the psychodynamic issue most fraught with ambivalence in our development: just how dependent or independent do we really want to be from the sources of our deepest attach- ment? Anthropos 99.2004</page><page sequence="13">Toward a Cultural Psychology of Voluntary Action Beliefs 423 This article has not questioned the starting point of the Boyer hypothesis: that the violations of intuitive assumptions inform or direct the construc- tion of superhuman agencies and their attributes. It does question their source. If the development of conflicted attachment is a human universal, or nearly so, then it would be surprising if ambiva- lence played no role in the genesis of religious propositions. Indeed, if my argument is correct, then it might even play the primary role, and the ontological expectations adduced by Boyer might function as enabling conditions. I make no argu- ment as to primacy, however. This is the problem with most arguments framed in exclusively cogni- tivist terms. They unnecessarily stunt the growth of theory by limiting it to purely operational vari- ables. The point is that human attachment and its internal contradictions are too important to over- look in any theory that claims that development, religious beliefs, and action orientations are inex- tricably related.
