Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986. xi + 238 pages. $39.50. 194 Many find that theology, if it belongs to a community of inquiry like science, needs to be fundamentally readjusted from time to time. Others, more attuned perhaps to the community of the faithful, resist that concern. At any rate, in our own time process theology has made a strong case for the modification of traditional theism, if it is to be reconciled with contemporary physics, particularly relativity physics. That revision has not gone unchallenged. Usually such opposition has resulted in simple rejection, but Creel's approach is far more subtle. In this carefully reasoned account, he argues that God is impassible in nature, will, and feeling. Nevertheless Hartshorne's basic argument for divine passibility in knowledge must be accepted, and therefore some modification of traditional immutability is needed. What he seeks to show is how little modification is necessary. In other words, he wants to show how one can accept Hartshorne's basic argument while yet remaining fundamentally a classical theist. While insisting on God's immutability in practically every other re- spect, this is not possible concerning God's knowledge of change. Changing things must be known as changing, but "a changing thing can be known as changing only by a knower whose awareness changes along with it" (p. 88). God knows the future with respect to free beings only in terms of what might be. Molina's theory that God knows what will be since it is part of the totality of all possibilities that God knows fails in "its assumption that God can know which possible world is the actual world" (p. 90). Creel seeks to reconcile such divine contingent knowledge with the notion that God's will is completely impassible. Thus God knows eternally every possibility and has willed how each should be evaluated. "God's will has always been resolved with regard to every possibility, and because it is impossible that God could improve upon his deci- sions by the discovery of some hitherto unknown fact, it is unreason- able to believe that he might want to change his mind or would change his mind" (p. 21). "God will never know anything more of relevance to the determination of his will than he has always known" (p. 21). Is this enough for me to feel that God is responding to me now in my time of anguish? Yes, with respect to the particular character of God's response. The naive Israelites may have supposed that God was then and there angry with them for worshipping the golden calf, but the author of the letter to the Hebrews immediately assures us that God's "works were finished from the foundation of the world" (He- brews 4:3). Creel offers us a more detailed and sophisticated version of this stance, while recognizing that an additional factor is needed: "for me to feel that God has not simply provided for me as a possibility</page><page sequence="2">195 but is also aware of me as an actuality, it is necessary for me to believe that God is aware of what is coming to pass in the world and is seeing which of his contingent decisions is coming to pass and which are not" (P. 31). This complex theory preserves a maximum of immutability, and it answers Thomas' objection that unless God were to know future contingents, there could be no providence in human affairs (pp. 100f.). Yet it means that God's temporal awareness would be powerless to af- fect his valuations and responses. This is a form of divine ephiphenome- nalism in which God's awareness is impotent to affect his dealings with the world. Nothing God currently experiences could ever make any difference to any of the decisions God has made eternally. Could we not liken God's eternal will to an incredibly complex programmed computer which directs all of God's activities, even though God is currently overseeing the world, howbeit in a purely passive way? Yet the logic of possibility drives us in the way of eternal valuation, it may be protested. Only if we suppose that there is nothing with respect to response and value that actualization can provide. I suspect the gulf between possibility and actuality is much greater than here supposed, rendering the valuation of "possible situations" problematic. A possible situation may well depend upon those past actualities func- tioning as its efficient causes. Pure possibilities resist valuation, for it is the way they can become actualized, and at what cost to alternative ways of actualization, that determines the good. "Insistence on birth at the wrong season is the trick of evil," Whitehead once wrote. If actualities are thus necessary for valuation, then God's responses cannot be made apart from a temporal awareness of the world. This awareness would not be as impotent as Creel's theory dictates. Creel accepts Hartshorne's argument that actuality must be emer- gent, but not his theory that possibility, at least in the form of quality, is also emergent. (Yet neither did Whitehead, for that matter.) "This means that God, as well as we, is continually increasing in knowledge as new shapes, colors, textures, creatures, etc., come to be, and it would seem to mean that sometimes God, as well as we, is completely sur- prised by what occurs, as when a new color ... occurs, or, even more dramatically, as when the perception of color occurs for the very first time" (p. 42). We are apt to think that the master of the universe could not be surprised by anything, nor should God be. But if God is completely secure, capable of responding adequately to anything that should ever occur, then God should seek surprises. It is only our implicit anthropo- morphism which suggests that God, like ourselves in our insecurity, should want to have everything mapped out in advance. If all possibilities were utterly mapped out in advance, wouldn't it be a boring existence for God? It might be objected that boredom is an anthropomorphic quality, but the real question is whether it is</page><page sequence="3">196 merely anthropomorphic, and this hinges on the role of novelty and adventure suitably generalized. The experience of novelty is the expe- rience of the temporal contrast between the old and the new. God if deprived of the perfection of adventure means that God must forever experience the same possibilities. Then each is as old as its neighbor, and there can be no genuine novelty. Yet for any specific emergent quality, there would be some time before which God would be ignorant of that quality (p. 52). On the other hand, "since God has always existed and, according to Harts- horne, has always been creative, at any point in time he will have al- ways already had an opportunity to learn an infinite number of things" (p. 53), if not the particular quality in question. Moreover, "it will always already be the case that God has learned all that could be sig- nificantly learned ... in order to make good decisions about all possible future situations" (p. 53). Creel sees no significant difference between such "learned" knowledge and the eternal knowledge of all possibili- ties." The inference seems to be that therefore we can rationally opt for eternal over temporal knowledge. Yet there does seem to be one major difference: on the temporal view, it is possible for God to expe- rience novelty. That value utterly washes out for God as eternal. The upshot of the argument so far is that God changes with respect to any knowledge of temporal contingents, but that in all other re- spects, particularly with respect to possibility, God is absolutely un- changing. Thus he argues that God possesses his life all at once, and is properly called eternal, but this "pertains to God as a self- determining agent," not to "everything that is ever true of God," since "God's knowledge of creatures cannot exist all at once because they do not exist all at once" (p. 108). Thus God is basically eternal, in the Boethi- an sense, with a temporal appendage. Here the question to ask is which is the more inclusive category? Can the timeless really include the temporal, or does the temporal (the everlasting, in the case of God) include the timeless? Hartshorne once asked this question of Tillich, but it is also in a way Aristotle's question of Plato. Creel also makes a second modification which, at first glance, would seem to favor the process alternative, but on the whole is very close to the classical position. He rejects creation out of nothing as absurd, as conflicting with the principle ex nihilo nihil fit (p. 65). So does process theism, yet for very different reasons. Process theism argues that it is flatly impossible to raise nothing to being, as the conservation laws of physics suggest. Creel assumes unilateral creation, whereby God can raise a possibility to actuality by divine omnipotence (p. 72). Never- theless there can be no creatio ex nihilo, because every actuality pre- supposes some possibility it actualizes. Thus each actuality requires the possibility from which it can be created. Thus Creel posits a ple- num of pure possibility outside God. Yet why should this be? It would seem that possibilities ultimately exist as contemplated and valued by</page><page sequence="4">197 the divine mind. Why could not such possibilities be comprehended by the notion of a divine logos, which is surely part of God? Creel's answer is brief, somewhat cryptic: "Theism rejects the idea that such possibili- ties are resident in God because that would imply pantheism" (p. 65). I suspect the implicit problem may concern ontological detachment. If actuality is to exist distinct from God, there must be something in its creation whereby this is possible. But if it is created solely by an act of God, and depends entirely upon God for what it is, it would have no being of its own. It would have no more independent being than a thought in God's mind. Thus if God were to create solely out of pos- sibilities in his mind, these actualities could only have existence as part of himself, which is indeed pantheism. But if there is genuine ontologi- cal detachment in creation, the possibilities could be inherent to God as that which is contemplated, yet not their actualizations. One reason for a material cause is to achieve ontological detachment from God. If there were nothing which has any recalcitrance, any re- sistance over against God, God would create only himself. Creel seeks a candidate for this role which would make the least possible modifica- tion to classical theism. Yet could possibility ever have sufficient power for the task? Matter at least has some sort of past existence, even if as chaos, while possibility would seem to have no existence of its own. Possibilities may function well as formal causes, but not as mate- rial ones. When the ancients rejected creatio ex nihilo, it was also in order to explain the imperfection of the world by a recalcitrant and yet some also formless matter. When process thinkers so object, it is to argue that creation is temporal (out of antecedent actuality) rather than eternal. It is also to protest the glorification of absolute unilateral power that creatio ex nihilo epitomizes, questioning whether power could not be more perfectly conceived as a power shared with creatures in creating. Creel shows that some modification in traditional impassibility is required. Should it be so minimal? Should we not use this opportunity for a more thorough restructuring of our theistic sensibilities? In par- ticular, what about divine suffering? This may well be an intensifica- tion of considerations as to what it means for God to know temporal actualities. There has been a momentous change in theological opinion with respect to divine suffering. Twenty years ago it was distinctly a minori- ty view perhaps spearheaded by the process critique, while today it is well on the way to becoming the majority view. Yet if so, it is most likely that divine suffering is affirmed on the basis of a reading of Scripture, unhampered by the classical rationality forbidding all feeling to God. The philosophical rationality process thought shares with Creel and with Thomism, has in this instance given way to another kind of approach. One argument Creel proposes against divine suffering needs to be</page><page sequence="5">198 considered: God might now be suffering infinitely, because if (as pro- cess theism teaches) some sort of world has always existed, God could have suffered every past evil in perfect memory. This does not reckon with the alternative of divine transformation of gross evil into tragic beauty accomplished by supplementation using God's infinite imagina- tive resources. Notice that this does not change the evil act itself, but it cleanses it from the conflicting elements it contains by placing it within a wider context. If evil is thus overcome in tragic beauty, divine suffering should be overcome in bliss. Why should Creel be so concerned to affirm the maximum divine immutability he believes is possible? I suspect the traditional sentiment for immutability weighs heavily here, although the basic argument in its favor denies any element of change whatsoever. Any modification will be resisted by many classical theists, because of this rationalistic argument: God's perfection, such that corruption is impossible, means that God cannot change. God must be timeless, and hence impassible, since the timeless cannot be changed by any external cause. This very tight and persuasive argument has been very effective in rendering the temporal understanding of God in ancient Israel and in process theism a mere anthropomorphism. Yet it should be carefully noted it assumes God to be a perfect being. Rather than think of God as a perfect being, immutable in every respect but knowl- edge, but we might consider the experiment of reconceiving God as the perfect instance of becoming. Lewis S.
