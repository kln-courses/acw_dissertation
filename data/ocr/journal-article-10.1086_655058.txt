      <p>This attractive and beautifully illustrated collection of natural history notes is a fascinating miscellany that covers several major themes in behavioral ecology. Larger chapters on inter and intraspecific interactions between animals, and between animals and plants, fungi, or bacteria, are split into easytoread sections that address topics such as mating strategies, sibling rivalry, seed dispersal, mutualisms, and parasitism. The section that details how ingesting or selfanointing with plant compounds affects the behavior of animals (including humans) is particularly engaging. The book ends with a brief but compelling plea for conservation of interactions, not just species.</p>
      <p>Crump's lowkey but consistent focus on adaptation, selective forces, and evolutionary pathways gives the quirky examples depth and a robust grounding in contemporary biology, while providing a strong narrative path. Her writing is conversational yet concise, and care is taken to point out that any apparent teleology or anthropomorphism is purely stylistic.</p>
      <p>Concepts are neatly explained at the beginning of each section without becoming a list of definitions, and the examples that follow are covered at a good level of detail. This format does mean the book is best suited to sporadic perusal rather than being read cover to cover. Most U.S.specific concepts and stories are explained quite well for international audiences. However, readers should never be encouraged to order specimens such as Mexican jumping beans over the internet, as this has serious conservation and quarantine concerns in many countries.</p>
      <p>This will be an appealing volume for any enthusiast, but lecturers and teachers may wish to check facts or consult more recent journal articles before using the material in class, especially in the section on orchid pollination. This task is easy because Crump acknowledges original researchers throughout the text and provides suggested readings for each chapter. The subjects chosen, straightforward format, and comprehensive index make this a very useful sourcebook of examples for biology and ecology classes.</p>
