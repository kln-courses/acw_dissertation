(New York: The Funk and Wagnalls Company, 1949-1950). 2 Vols., pp. xii/531, iv/534-1196. By WAYLAND D. HAND Few works of reference compiled by American scholars in folk- lore and related fields have ever been as widely discussed as the Funk and Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology, and Leg- end. That this work should have evoked by turns sharp criticism as well as fulsome praise inheres, of course, in the tremendous scope and</page><page sequence="2">268 Midwest Folklore, 1:4 importance of the Dictionary itself. The good things that have been. said about it are acknowledgements of the increasing competence of our American folklore scholars; negative appraisals, too, are in the main healthy signs of a critical awareness of the problems and methods. of folklore study. Together, they give strong confirming evidence of the great development that has taken place in American folklore- scholarship during the last sixty years. From all the controversy about the dictionary there has emerged the one cardinal fact: American scholars have compiled the first general dictionary of folklore and mythology. From this pioneer effort there will come, this reviewer pre- dicts, a second edition and as many other augmented editions as will be necessary to cover adequately the broad field envisaged in the title. That the publishers essayed more in an ambitious "standard" diction- ary of folklore than any reasonable staff of editors and contributors could deliver in but two double-column quarto volumes, will, I be- lieve, be readily admitted by anyone familiar with such basic works of reference for individual fields as the Handworterbuch des deutschen Aberglaubens, Feilberg's great dictionary of the folk speech (and folk- lore) of Jutland, Thompson's Motif-Index of Folk-Literature, the Anthropophyteia, Lean's Collectanea, The Mythology of All Races, Child's English and Scottish Popular Ballads, The Golden Bough, and many other multiple-volume work. In fairness, then, and the term "standard" to the contrary, the Dictionary must be judged on the basis of its great selectivity for the almost limitless areas covered, the dis- cernible criteria by which items within a given field are included and others left out, and the adequacy of treatment of individual subjects in relationship to their importance within that field. To do the work justice in these terms would seem to call not for a single reviewer, but a whole battery of experts. One of the outstanding features of the Dictionary is the treatment of the folklore and mythology of various countries under such typical headings as European Folklore, Slavic Mythology, North American Indian Folklore, Celtic Folklore, Indonesian Mythology, Semitic Folk- lore and Mythology, Spanish Folklore, Latvian Folklore and Myth- ology, Germanic Folklore, etc., etc. These general articles often supply the background into which individual entries, properly cross-refer- enced, are made to fit. Even though such surveys run to over thirty, many countries rich in folklore are omitted entirely, and, for example, whereas several of the smaller Baltic countries are treated individually, all of the Germanic countries, including English, are lumped into a single article! American users of the Dictionary will be distressed to discover that in an otherwise able exposition, B. A. Botkin manages to</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 269 treat American folklore entirely without reference to Anglo-American balladry, and likewise to ignore the Harvard circle of scholars that have done so much to foster folkloristic science in America. Botkin's shorter entries on various topics of American folklore, however, are among the best in the whole dictionary for brevity, clarity, and for the bibliographical references supplied. For the first time in a general dictionary of folklore, to my knowl- edge, has there been a more or less consistent attempt to synopsize in- dividual folk tales and ballads, and to treat cycles in survey fashion. This is a tremendous help to teacher and student alike, and one regrets that it could not be carried out on a broader scale. MacEdward Leach's excellent synopses of folk songs, and his long summary article on the ballad, betray an extensive knowledge of the field, going well beyond his own specialization in Anglo-American balladry. Individual folk tales have generally fared well, although here the work seems to have been distributed to many staff people rather than to one or two persons. In this same connection, Erminie W. Voegelin and others have covered the Amerind field in a manner that will reveal to many students of folklore for the first time the narrative art of American native peoples. Thompson's Tales of the North American Indians and other standard works were well utilized in the task. The effort to accord the same specific treatment to Aesopic fables and other narrative forms, and to metrical romances, and to press from Europe into Asia and Africa, and westward from America to the islands of the Pacific and to the Orient is a step in the right direction. To accomplish this objective fully, of course, will take time, and will necessitate the collaboration of experts for the various areas and genres under survey. In the field of the folk tale, for example, one can go far with Bolte-Polivka insofar as the few eastern tales are concerned that have Grimm analogues, but beyond that, for the vast bulk of Asiatic and African storyology one must seek other resources. In addition to the synopsizing of prominent songs and tales there has been an effort to supply Motif-Index numbers for narrative ele- ments in the manner of the Handworterbuch des deutschen Marchens, but this appears not to have been consistently carried out. Numerous motifs are not numbered. Treated, for example, are such motifs as the "stick-fast" motif, "killing by pointing," "the old (faithful) dog," "jewels from spittle," the "speaking head," "letter of death," etc., etc., but one misses, on the other hand, such prominent motifs as "slipper test," except in a passing reference under "shoes," the "Ring of Poly- crates," and the "Apple of Discord." Inappropriate headings, more- over, have decreased the general effectiveness of motif listings. Two</page><page sequence="4">270 Midwest Folklore, 1:4 examples will suffice: instead of an entry under "lice" or "lousing,'&gt; one finds Motif K874, "Deception by lousing," under "Deception, etc."; "power in dung" is listed under "power" rather than under "dung." Only the complete index promised in a supplemental volume will spare the searcher a constant routine of trial and error. The zeal to range far afield and to give the Dictionary an exotic character not paralleled by any other work of its kind has led to serious omissions of subject fields closer at hand. The user of the Dictionary, for example, will search in vain for general treatises on such fields of study as superstition, custom and usage, and costume and dress. The last omission can be accounted for by what appears to have been an editorial policy against including material culture, which, of course, does not yield to conventional dictionary treatment anyway; but to ex- clude treatises on superstition and custom and usage, is to ignore areas of human thought and action that underly all folklore and mythology. Even though legend is prominently featured in the title of the dic- tionary itself, legendry itself is treated all too inadequately (see "leg- end" and "local legend"). Folk medicine is treated under "cures," "dis- eases," "medicine," and other headings instead of in a definitive article incorporating the major phases of the subject. Though considerable emphasis in the Dictionary is given to the folk tale and to related fields, there are no entries under exemplum, facetiae, Gesta Roma- norum, Straparola, and the Pentamerone. The omission of Basile's work is the more serious in view of the fact that there is no survey of Italian folklore. Brief definitions of achtergewicht, Dreizahl, and of Marchentyp itself, which every student of the comparative folk tale will have to use sooner or later, would have been welcome; similar terminology for other fields would also have added to the usefulness of the work. The treatment of a subject by different authors is to be applauded in cases where the material comes from totally unrelated or widely divergent sources. By the use of this editorial procedure Mrs. Leach and her associates have been able to assemble in one entry various aspects of a subject that often lead around the world, involving an intellectual resource possessed by no one person, however learned. Oc- casionally this device has been carried too far, and multiple treatment has failed for the want of a central organizing hand. This is no better seen than in the entries under "evil eye" and "fatal look," where, by- individual effort, three competent contributors have not been able to achieve a satisfactory treatment of the general subject in question. Most unfortunate for folklore, in this connection, and particularly for folklore in America, where the subject of folklore still awaits legitimi-</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 271 zation, is the wholesale definition of folklore by twenty folklorists of widely differing background. The eclectic method rmight have been employed by the staff in obtaining a variety of opinions, and then giv- ing them to one or two of our most eminent authorities for a final digest. Wholesale duplication would have been avoided, basic differ- ences resolved, and the present centrifugal effect of the whole effort would have certainly given way to a more unified and coherent judg- ment. The treatment of folklore under various ethnic and regional head- ings, as discussed in the second paragraph, emphasizes the program- matic aspects of folklore, and is important not only to literature, music, and art, but also to a better understanding of history and other of the social sciences. Worthy of mention also is the treatment of folklore and related fields from philosophical and methodological points of view. Even more consideration might have been given to such theoretical matters, for, whereas there are good entries on ethnocentrism, accul- turation, diffusion theory, anthropomorphism, etc., there is nothing on such basic concepts as "volkstiimlichkeit," and "gesunkenes Kultur- gut." This latter concept has been perhaps the most widely discussed theoretical subject in folklore during the twentieth century, just as the theories of fairy tale origins challenged the founders of the folklore dis- cipline over a century ago. Biographical sketches add much to any work of reference, and the editors have liberally alloted space for the purpose of connecting works and movements with their authors. In these matters judgments are always arbitrary. Perhaps in treating Bolte, for example, it is a per- missible economy to mention Reinhold Kohler also, but not to thus dispose of Polivka also, whose contribution to the notes of the Grimm tales has all too long been minimized. If one includes sketches of Miil- lenhoff and Kuhn, for example, why not remember the great work briefly of Hoffmann-Krayer and Friedrich S. Krauss?; why, in addition to a galaxy of Scandinavian savants, include Castr6n, but omit Feilberg and L6nnrot?; why forget Italy's great Pitre; why memorialize Clous- ton and lesser lights of British folklore, but neglect Brand, Clodd, and Cecil Sharp? Failure to mention W. W. Newell, Reed Smith, and John A. Lomax will distress a lot of American workers who appreciate the signal contributions of these men. One of the most serious faults of the Dictionary is its lack of bib- liographical sources. Many contributors have taken care to indicate their sources; others have either ignored the existing scholarly litera- ture or failed to state their indebtedness to it. It is to be devoutly hoped that greater attention will be paid to such documentation in</page><page sequence="6">272 Midwest Folklore, 1:4 future editions. Wider consultation of the best authorities on all sub- jects will greatly enhance the scholarly value of the Dictionary, in- crease its authority as a work of reference, and open up avenues of re- search for the more serious student. Likewise, closer attention should be given to bibliographical references, particularly to editions cited. In addition to this, greater effort should be made to standardize citations. To achieve uniformity is a most difficult task, what with the variety of bibliographical patterns for various fields. Spelling of foreign titles should be checked and double-checked. The only really bad mistake noted is the reference to the Handworterbuch des deutschen Aberglau- bens, edited by Hanns Bachtold-Staubli and Eduard von Hoffman- Krayer, where there are six mistakes of spelling and a misleading date (I, v). Despite its shortcomings, which I have certainly not tried to em- phasize in this review, the Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology, and Leg- end is an indispensable work of reference. Its real potential, in America and elsewhere, will be realized only by physical expansion commensurate with its almost limitless scope. For this gigantic under- taking, many more scholars will have to be enlisted; they should be drawn from all quarters of the globe. A good start has been made!
