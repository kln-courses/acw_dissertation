Hermann BÃ¶hlaus Nachf., Graz, for Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna 1965 (Denkschriften, Philosophisch- historische Klasse, 90) 144 Sch. One of the most important dis- coveries of the Austrian Expedi- tion to Nubia is a wealth of rock art in the region of Sayala, which provides a substantial addition to the corpus of engravings known from previous works by H. A. Winkler, H. J. Dunbar and other scholars. In the second report of the ex- pedition's results the author presents an analysis of the boats depicted in the rock engravings. He recognizes twelve types of boats, most of which he dates to Pre- and Pro- todynastic times, while a few are attributed to the Dynastic and Roman periods. The author dis- tinguishes between Egyptian and foreign types, and most of his chronological considerations are thorough and well conceived. The illustration is uneven, the drawings being of poor quality, while the photographs are tech- nically good but reproduce surfaces on which chalking emphasizes certain figures and ignores others. Two main problems are not much considered: 1) Why are so many boat figures depicted on the rocks, what is the reason for rep- resenting this subject? Are they simple boats or ritual boats, and what is the significance of the nu- merous scenes in which boats are in- volved? 2) What is the meaning of the figures and symbols appearing near or on the boats, such as " 'totem- poles/' tree-like and leaf-like pat- terns, figures of weapons and tools, and peculiar anthropomorphic and zoomorphic depictions? An analysis of these elements would add data never before systematically considered in the rock art of Egypt and the Sudan. The Bering Land Bridge Edited by David M. Hopkins For the first time the data of geology, oceanography, paleon- tology, plant geography, and anthropology are brought to- gether in one volume to focus upon the problems and the lessons of Beringia. The editor has prepared an extensive Epilogue synthesizing the information. Illustrated.
