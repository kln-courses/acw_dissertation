<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. XXXV, No. 3 JOURNAL OF ASIAN STUDIES MAY 1976 A Model for the Study of Thai Buddhism B. J. TERWIEL T HIS paper' constitutes an attempt to reconcile-at least for one region of Southeast Asia: central Thailand-one of the discrepancies in analyses of contemporary Theravada Buddhism. The model proposed below-which is the outcome of comparing some of the relevant literature with my own field data2-encompasses two distinct sections of society, each holding a different attitude towards Buddhism. The interaction between different interpretations of religion may well be one of the major factors in the process of religious change in Thailand. Furthermore, this model may be of use for other Theravada Buddhist countries. Literature on the Subject A survey of the literature on the practice of religion in Theravada Buddhist countries reveals what may be a unique situation in the study of religions. Many authors state unequivocally that Theravada Buddhists adhere to more than one religious tradition. Apart from "otherworldly" Buddhism, these Southeast Asian peoples adhere to other strands of religion, generally classed under rubrics such as "non-Buddhist beliefs," "folk religion," "animism," or "supernaturalism." Yet, though virtually all authors recognize this situation, there is no consensus in their views on how the different subsystems are interrelated. Some authors, while differentiating between Buddhist and non-Buddhist practices and beliefs, maintain that these different types of religion have in the course of centuries become so intermingled that at present it is impossible to draw a distinction between them. They cannot state where Buddhism ends and religion of a different type begins. Such views are expressed unequivocally by some and implicitly by others; 3 these authors appear to have decided that religion in Theravada Buddhist countries is a blend of two traditions. Others maintain that the undistinguishable mixture is made up of three different types of creeds.4 B. J.

TERWIEL Some authors, however, consider that the distinction between Buddhism and non- Buddhism can be clearly drawn; these scholars tend to see Buddhism and non-Buddhism as complementary subtypes of religion, with each subtype fulfilling a distinct function in society. From this perspective, Buddhism is concerned with future lives and otherworldly goals, whilst local religious beliefs deal with the magical side of everyday life.5 One author recognizes two religious orientations but, instead of giving them complementary status, deems them to be incompatible and opposed.6 Yet other researchers distinguish between Buddhism on the one hand and animism on the other, but do not appear to rely on functionalist explanations of this phenomenon.7 And then there are more complex analyses in which more than two sub-religions are distinguished.8 Many other researchers have put forward ideas that appear to place them among one of the groups of scholars mentioned above. This paper is not intended, however, to weigh the arguments of all authors on the practice of Theravada Buddhism and decide whether a scholar belongs to the syncretists, or to the multiple-layer group. For the purpose of this paper, suffice it to note that there is general agreement amongst them only with regards to the opinion that, next to the Buddhist faith, there can be found in Theravada Buddhist countries one or more layers of non-Buddhist religion. There is widespread disagreement, however, on the number of strata that can be recognized, on their interrelations, and on the value of distinguishing between these layers. Thailand,'' in F.S.C.

I hoped, by in-depth interviews, to be able to decide whether the syncretists or those favoring a com- partmentalization of religious beliefs had the more suitable approach.9 Fieldwork was carried out at the monastery of Wadsaancaw, which is situated on the south bank of the river Maeklong, in the province of Ratburi. During the period of research, the number of households that regularly supported the monastery was ii6. Most of these households derived their main income from the cultivation of rice. The provincial capital was only five kilometers away, but Wadsaancaw maintained its rural character because it was con- nected to the network of roads only by a footpath. The simplest way of reaching the provincial market was by hailing a boat from one of the monastery jetties.'0 The main period of research was divided into two segments: during the first six months, I lived in the monastery as a fully ordained memnber of the Sarugha; in the second half of the year I lived as a layman on a farm in the vicinity of Wadsaancaw. Adoption of the role of Buddhist monk greatly facilitated fieldwork. Fellow monks as well as laymen considered it quite ordinary that I asked questions concerning the principles of the religion in which I had so obviously taken a deep interest. Although the role had certain disadvantages-in that it limited my freedom to move, and restricted some detailed recording of conversations-it was very much suited to in-depth interviews on matters such as the relation between Buddhism and non-Buddhist practices. However, during the first months of fieldwork, it became clear that questions with regard to the division or the syncretism of Buddhist and non-Buddhist practices presented informants with severe problems. Though in general no reticence was met when discussing religious beliefs or practices, as soon as the question arose whether this was in accordance with the teachings or contravened the doctrine, a variety of reactions was observed. The more sophisticated persons usually brought forward the view that the Lord Buddha had never forbidden ancient rituals to take place. Others hesitatingly made up their minds with regard to the orthodoxy of a ritual, but on subsequent occasions contradicted their own judgement. Many were at a loss to classify rituals or beliefs under headings such as "Buddhist" and ''non-Buddhist." It soon appeared that informants were classifying merely to please the researcher; the categories under discussion had little relevance in their minds. Before three months of fieldwork had elapsed, I therefore decided to defer matters of overall broad classification until I had more knowledge of the actual beliefs. Consequently, even when noting behavior that was flagrantly contrary to the written code, questions about such behavior were not centered upon the problems of orthodoxy. Instead of taking the body of written material on Buddhism as the point of reference, the investigation was directed towards finding out actual practices and the attitudes towards these modes of behavior. Discrep- ancies between the rules of the canon and actions were left to a later date. The shift in approach proved very fruitful. To illustrate its benefits, two examples of interesting conversations that resulted are presented here. These are not verbatim reports, 9 Preparation for this fieldwork included obtain- ing a working knowledge of Thai, as well as study- ing Pali and the history of Buddhism. 10 Since my fieldwork, the situation has changed drastically. In Feb 1974 I found that a bridge had been built, allowing motorized traffic to reach the monastery. Consequently, the influence of urban life was everywhere visible. New houses had been built, electricity had been introduced; in a recently erected roadside cafe I noticed the first television set.</page><page sequence="4">394 B. J. TERWIEL for the fieldwork situation forbade direct recording; conversations were noted down whenever I had a moment of privacy, often late at night. Example I: July 3I, I968, Wadsaancaw. During a friendly talk, a monk complained that he had hoped to pay off his debts, but he had not won in the lottery this week. He had not spent any money on the lottery for some weeks now, but had the feeling that this time he might be lucky. Unfortunately it did not come true. Question: Did you ever win a prize. Answer: Yes, last year I got 200 baht for my io-baht ticket. Q.: What would you do if you won a million baht? A.: I would give a generous sum to the monastery to build something. Did you know that that is how the big cetiya had come to be built, as well as the school on the monastery grounds? Of course I would keep a good amount to set up a pleasant life. Q.: Do all monks buy in the lottery? A.: No, only a few can afford it. The Venerable [X] buys every week; he has a small pension from the government because his son was killed in the war. Q.: Does a monk have the same chance to win a prize as a layman? A.: Probably a monk has a better chance; after all, he is apart by virtue of his discipline. But yt-ou cannot count on good luck; you never can reckon on the fact that merit will work instantaneously. The full implications of this conversation can be seen when one realizes that the rules of the Buddhist monk explicitly forbid him to gamble or even to touch money." The Wadsaancaw monks are aware of this; but, though in general they follow many of the rules of behavior with great care, those concerning the handling of money and gambling are regularly broken. Later during the fieldwork it became clear that only those rules that contravene basic presuppositions of the farming community are generally broken. The reason why several monks buy in the lottery and do not come under pressure to improve their behavior lies in the fact that monks are closely associated with wealth, with monetary gain, and especially with luck in hazardous situations. The second example shows a similar situation. I chose it because it too appears, on first sight, to contradict monastic discipline. Example 2: August 3, I968, Wadsaancaw. The Venerable[X],who had only recently become a monk, showed me what he had obtained from the abbot of a neighboring monastery-a small glass bottle filled with some diaphanous liquid which contained two small wooden images. Each of the pieces of wood appeared to represent a human being. One, about ijcm. tall, was made of black wood; the other, approximately i cm. high, was made of much lighter wood. Q.: Who gave this to you? A.: I went especially to the abbot of [Y] to ask for this. It is a rag/om, the abbot there is well known for them. Q.: What is it used for? A.: In order to make women love you, you must carry it in the pocket of your shirt. This one has been blessed by several famous monks. It carries metta,c therefore it will make you popular, and especially make women fall in love with you. Q.: But you are a monk. What do you need women to fall in love with you for? A.: This is for when I leave the order later this year. When you are a monk, you can obtain such objects to use when you have become a layman again. This example touches upon the intricate complex of small Buddha images, medal- lions, protective objects, and the like with which the monks are intimately linked.

Relevant for our approach to the religion of Wadsaancaw is the fact that highly respected monks are famed for their manufacturing and blessing of such objects. They not only make Buddha images which are reputed to make their wearer invulnerable, and which protect against car accidents; they can also use their influence in such a manner that they charge an object such as the raggiom with a power amounting to love magic. To the farmer, this situation presents no problems. In the case of the raog/om, monks are able to charge the object with the appropriate spells. They confer mettoz-a concept derived from Pali, which can mean sympathy, friendliness, and amity as well as the more passionate form of friendship we call love. Some monks of high repute can invest the rag/om with so much mettcz that a layman who carries the small bottle becomes irresistible to the opposite sex. In the literature on religion in Southeast Asia, mention is often made of the complex of medallions, tiny Buddha images, and other objects that are carried by virtually every man in Thailand who has to face a dangerous situation. It is usually considered a charming bit of superstition which has survived notwithstanding the insights held by enlightened people. In Wadsaancaw, however, it is impossible to put ideas about amulets as second-ranking to religious ideas; these objects pervade many important ceremonies. The Religion of Widsancaiw As the fieldwork progressed and I attended more rituals, both in the role of a monk and as a layman, it became apparent that the religion of the monks and farmers differed fundamentally from Buddhism as it can be distilled from the Pali canon. Even the monks, who often act in perfect accordance with the rules of the Patimokkha, and who chant stanzas often derived from the Tipitaka, hold beliefs that have no relation to the philosophical doctrine preached by the Buddha. The principles that underlie Wadsaan- caw religion are not based upon the four noble truths and the eightfold path of textual Buddhism. Although a few senior monks may have heard of such concepts, these have no bearing on their daily religious life. I became aware that the basic religious orientation of the Wadsaancaw farmer is centered upon a "magico-animistic" complex of beliefs and practices. "Magical power" proved to be a key concept for analyzing rituals and beliefs. Only those ideas and practices of Buddhism that can be interpreted in terms of animism appear to be fully incorporated in the farmer's religion. Ideas and practices, generally known as Buddhist, that neither contradicted nor reinforced this basic orientation appeared to be rather ephemeral and unimportant to the farmer. Aspects that appeared contradictory to animism were usually reinterpreted in other terms or not incorporated at all in Wadsaan- A . caw religion. An example of how Buddhist aspects are incorporated in magico-animistic ritual can be found in the Thai version of the well-known ceremony of consecrating water. This ceremony may be performed by monks and laymen, in the monastery as well as outside. Often an elaborate version takes place in the house of a layman, who has invited a chapter of monks for that purpose. The group of monks, seated on a dais in an auspicious place in the house, simultaneously recite in loud and clear voices a certain number of Pali texts. While chanting they hold a cotton thread between index finger and thumb of both hands, which are held raised at chest level, palm-to-palm. The cotton thread is connected</page><page sequence="6">396 B. J. TERWIEL to a bowl of water and to a Buddha image. It encircles the house in which the ceremony takes place and is attached to the shrine of the Lord of the Earth (phra'Phuum), which stands in a corner of the compound. It is believed that beneficial power is emitted by the monks while they recite the Pali stanzas. It is also accepted, by monks and laymen, that this power travels from the bodies of the monks through the cotton thread, that it is reinforced by the image of the Buddha, and that it activates the powers of the Lord of the Earth. The combination of reciting monks, Buddha image, and Lord of the Earth causes the house to become a sacred, protected place-but specifically, it charges the water in the bowl with power. While the chanting is in progress, the most senior monk holds a lighted candle above the surface of the water in such a position that wax drips into the bowl. When this senior monk is of the opinion that sufficient texts have been chanted, he begins the Ratana Sutta. When the words khlanam pur,a'am navam natthi sambhavamn12 are reached, he extinguishes the candle in the water. This constitutes the core of the ritual of water consecration. This well-known ceremony occurs on almost all the occasions when monks are invited to assist with a ritual outside the monastery itself. It can be observed at a housewarming, a marriage, a thanksgiving for a good season, or a first hair-shaving ceremony. It is present in the ritual of chanting for rain in the fields and is used at the chanting to cause long life. The consecrated water can be sprinkled over the persons attending. The main sponsor of the ritual may use the water to rinse himself or rub the top of his head, or he may drink a quantity of the sacral water. Such close contact with consecrated water is believed to be beneficial. It reputedly has the power to bring luck, and it may ward off illness. The manner of interpreting the Pali canon fits the basic underlying premises of these rural people. This can be seen in the fact that some of the rules of the Samgha are adhered to in a meticulous manner, but other prescriptions, as can be seen in the example of the lottery, are sometimes neglected. Such deviations from the rules cannot be ascribed to an ignorance of the letter of the law. The Nawakowa'ad-a textbook for recently ordained monks which contains a guideline to monastic discipline-is widely distri- buted;'3 i966 saw its 64th printing, with an issue of ioo,ooo copies. While it can be assumed that even in remote rural monasteries the official rules are at hand, it can also be observed throughout Thailand that some prescripiions are followed with even more stringency than the Nawakowacad suggests. One of the areas of monkly behavior in which the Thais appear to act with extraordinary punctiliousness is connected with the avoidance of women. For instance, when a woman wishes to present a gift to a monk, she cannot simply hand over the object as a man would. Instead, she must wait until the monk has spread out a piece of cloth and taken hold of a side of the material; then she can deposit her donation on the cloth. This simple ritual act can be related to the magico-animistic background in several ways. In the first place, some type of contact, no matter how indirect, is deemed necessary during the ritual presentation. This continuity is needed to make it possible that some reward reaches the donor at the moment of giving. Her gain in the transaction is some luck-bringing force, a bit of beneficial power which flows from the fingers of the monk, via the cloth, through the object to her fingers. The second aspect of the monk's ritual 12 It is destroyed and exhausted; no rebirth is produced.'' 13 Vaj iranainavaraorasa, Nawakowacad (Bangkok: The Buddhist Univ. Mahamukuta Educational Council, I966), pp. I-28.</page><page sequence="7">THAI BUDDHISM 397 receiving of a woman's gift, which reveals the principles underlying religious behavior, is the public demonstration of the physical distance between monk and woman. Although the Patimokkha refers many times to rules that are clearly intended to prevent gossip about the sexual behavior of the monk, it does not prescribe the total physical avoidance of women displayed by Thai monks. Though in rural monasteries young monks may be observed speaking freely to females in public, sometimes including women who may regard them as potential marriage partners, they may not place themselves in physical proximity to them. A Thai monk, in all circumstances, avoids touching women-even if these are close relatives or babies in arms. The monks of Wadsaancaw do not stroke a dog or a cat before having ascertained that the animal is male. It could be argued that the monk does keep himself aloof from women in order to demonstrate publicly his abstinence. After all, in the eyes of the farmers, monks derive some of their magical power by abstaining from sexual activity, not eating during certain periods, and refraining from consuming intoxicating beverages. This is true to a certain extent; however, it appeared that another factor is involved in the maintenance of distance from females. Women are associated with magical power that is believed to be diametrically opposed to that of the monk. Women are linked to this magical power, which reputedly can destroy some of the beneficial force of members of the Samrgha, because of the feminine capacity to menstruate; menstrual blood is considered highly charged with magical power"4 and can be used in some of the strongest forms of love magic. Such considerations may underlie some of the physical-avoidance behavior of the monk. The Order in the Animated World Throughout the fieldwork period, consideration of the magico-animistic outlook of the farmers and monks proved to be necessary for a full appreciation of the religion of Wa'dsaancaw. Observance and participation in hundreds of rituals made it possible to catalog regularities and draw up important characteristics of the animistic worldview. In the first place, magical power appears to be centered in certain objects and activities. Secondly, the farmers believe that the intensity of the power diminishes drastically as the physical distance from the source increases. A third characteristic of magical power is that there are differences in quality between one type of power and another. Fourthly, there appears to be a variation in the operational level of power: sometimes the animistic aspect is hidden, in other cases it is central and overt. (I.) Sources of magicalpower. There is no sharp division between physical powers of nature and magical power. The earth, which has the capacity to make plants grow, is sometimes seen as theriomorph: a chthonic snake. The concept of rice is personified in the shape of a beautiful lady, Mother Phoosop. The wind, the river, a tree, a house all may be related to anthropomorphic beings, each with specific likes and dislikes. A farmer learns to be polite and pleasing to the most important among them. Nature can provide men with unexpected seats of power. A termite hill not far from Wa'dsaancaw had a considerable reputation; its power, when properly invoked, was often used to increase luck in business. A spectacular sacralization took place on 25 September I968, when lightning struck the temple of Wadsaancaw. Scorched pieces of plaster were immediately collected, for they can be used in the manufacture of amulets. Sometimes a smooth round stone of fist size or even bigger is dragged up from the bottom of the river; 14 Textor (n. 8 above), p. I05.</page><page sequence="8">398 B. J. TERWIEL such a stone should be kept in the rice-storage hut, for it possesses the power to make Mother Phoosop happy. Another example of a magical object provided by nature is a lump of resin in which the shape of a Buddha image can be recognized. Among the activities reputed to generate magical power, two are conspicuous: the uttering of sacred words, and meditation. In this respect, both monks and laypersons can be a source of power. In practice there is a division of labor between them. The monks, who professionally spend a great deal of their time reciting Pali texts, and controlling mind and body in meditation, are the appropriate persons to perform rituals for laypersons only when their exalted positions do not prevent them from doing so. Whenever a ritual is directed primarily towards politely requesting spirits to assist human endeavors, monks are excluded from the supplication itself because a monk is considered to be higher on a hierarchical scale of ritual preeminence than a spirit. That is why, for example, monks may be invited to consecrate a bowl of water at a marriage ceremony in central Thailand, but laypersons are needed to lead the presentation of the couple to the ancestors. Lay specialists can always raise their hands in petition to a spirit; a monk, when addressing a spirit, must keep his hands down. The laypersons may utter the same sacred Pali words that a monk uses, but the former often can freely use a collection of esoteric syllables. A layperson can sometimes be observed, when consecrating water, using the same technique that a monk employs, with the aid of a candle and a prolonged uttering of sacred words. Another category of material considered to be invested with magical power derives its force from offensiveness and danger. These forces can be employed when wishing to harm an enemy, or when it is considered desirable to weaken the willpower of an opponent. Examples of this type of powerful substance are human excrement and menstrual blood. The most dangerous of all is a liquid ritually extracted from the corpse of a person who died inauspiciously. (2.) Secondary sources. The closer to the seat of magical power one moves, the stronger the influence of the power is. There is a widespread belief that an object of the appropriate shape, exposed to a sufficient amount of magical power, will become a secondary seat of the force. Good examples of this principle are provided by small protective objects. The existence of small objects that may ward off evil is noted by many authors on Southeast Asian religion. W.A.R. Wood, writing about North Thailand, comments: It would be possible to write a biggish book about charms to ward off sword or bullet wounds. There are dozens of different kinds-tattoo marks, written formulas, knotted strings, tiny images of Buddha, precious stones, dried seeds, needles in the body, and others too numerous to mention.'5 However, it is little known that often these charms have no innate protective power. When a small Buddha image or medallion is bought from a shop, no farmer will put trust in it until it has been charged properly. The best way to sacralize protective amulets is to bring them in close contact with a source of beneficial magical power. Thus it is possible to put a bundle of charms, such as small Buddha images or little metal scrolls engraved with magical drawings, behind one of the pillows of the ornamental preaching chair, immediately before a sermon is held. The objects will be impregnated with the power that emanates from the monk who utters sacred words during the preaching. Similarly, as F. Cripps"6 noted, during an ordination ceremony, friends of the aspirant monk may place 15 Consul in Paradise (London: Souvenir Press, I965), p. 88. 16 The Far Province (London: Hutchinson, i965), p. 84.</page><page sequence="9">THAI BUDDHISM 399 their strings of charms in the metal begging-bowl that plays a part during the climax of the ritual. When the monk-to-be prostrates himself with the begging-bowl in a sling resting on his back, the amulets may shift and rattle audibly. When the objects thus reveal their presence, everybody the ordainer included may smile amusedly, knowing what caused the noise. Many monks keep a small store of medallions and Buddha images to satisfy the demands of visiting monks and laypersons. In this context, it is relevant to note the ceremonial manner with which such an object is handled: When a monk donates an amulet he may hold it to his mouth, mutter a short Pali sentence, meditate a few seconds, or blow fiercely upon the object before giving it. The person who receives it holds the object between his hands, then raises his hands and presses them to his forehead for a brief moment. One of the many types of fundraising ceremonies villagers can organize in their monastery is a ritual specifically intended to invest small objects with protective power. Anyone can give his bundle of amulets to the organizing committee, for a small fee. The most sacred place inside the temple is fenced off, and in the center are placed sacks that may contain thousands of charms; medallions cast especially for this occasion may be included. A group of monks who have been invited because of their extensive knowledge of chants and meditation, surrounds the objects; during a long session of recitation and deep meditation, the sacks and their contents are permeated with beneficial power. The immediate surroundings of monkly ritual are thus believed to be beneficially charged; hence, in the course of time, many objects and areas of the monastery itself obtain an intrinsic value in the eyes of the villagers. The main temple is a seat of power by virtue not only of its original consecration, but also through the force of chanting and meditation of the inhabitants of the monastery. The palm-leaf books inscribed with sacred writing, and even the study books of novices and monks, are closely associated with protective magic. (3.) The range of powers. Religious behavior is often directly concerned with the acquisition of magical power, and the handling of this force. In many instances, it is possible to discern different types of power: Some forces are considered protective and beneficial, while others are dangerous and aggressive. Between these extremes there is an ambiguous region. Table I depicts the range of powers, and some examples are given to illustrate this ordering. On the dangerous end of the scale are sources that represent moments of great uncertainty, when people are likely to be thrown out of balance. The ambiguous section can be related to moments of magnitude in the life of a person the outcome of which could be good, but which could also turn out unfavorably. On the beneficial end of the range, the forces are connected solely with positive actions. (4.) Variations on the operative level. The fourth aspect of the magico-animistic worldview concerns the level of awareness of the notion of magical power during religious actions. In some rituals, the acquisition and manipulation of the invisible force is the foremost reason for holding the ceremony; and many actors are aware of this. On other occasions, although research indicates the same principles to be at work, the actors appear much less conscious of them. In the course of this paper, examples of both these cases have been mentioned. A clear case of religious behavior whereby considerations of animism appear to be foremost is the consecration of a bowl of water by a chapter of monks, or the ritual that invests sacks of small objects with protective power. An example of religious behavior that the researcher may link with underlying animistic principles, but that in practice is seldom directly related to magical force by the actors themselves, is the special rural inter-</page><page sequence="10">400 B.

It was noted that some rules are regularly broken because they are in conflict with animistic principles, while other prescriptions are followed more closely than the texts would lead us to expect. This deviating from the written code can be linked to animistic principles. The actors' lack of awareness of the regularities in their adaptation of the official rules may be an indication of the impact of the historical "Great Tradition''; open breaches of the official code of behavior seem to be on the wane. Especially since the beginning of the Chakri dynasty, in the last part of the eighteenth century, the central government has, with increasing success, tried to propagate strict adherence to the rules. The administrative organization of the Thai Samgha makes it possible that decrees concerning proper monastic conduct will be heard even in isolated rural monasteries. The farming community generally looks favorably upon such reforms. In the view of many farmers, strong discipline is related to strong forces emanating from the members of the Sarugha when they perform their rituals. Wa'dsaancaw farmers do not continually connect every aspect of monastic discipline with the acquisition of magical force; this would set them at variance with the teachings of the Buddhist church. After all, in radio talks and in official documents, the automatic reward for behaving according to the rules as they are laid down in the Patimokkha is not magical power, but an increase in merit. However, as an illustration of the manner in which the farmers come to terms with much of the Buddhist doctrine, it can be noted how such a key concept of Buddhism as that of merit is related to other aspects of their religious outlook. Merit and Good Luck In a section of L.M. Hanks' I962 article,17 he remarks on the different roles of merit and power in the explanation of successful behavior. He argues that these two concepts can form alternative explanations for the occurrence of such behavior.

THE ROLE OF MERIT IN THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE FARMER Stage Ideas about merit Past lives Meritorious deeds of the past will have resulted in the more fortunate aspects of the present circumstances of an individual-such as good health, rich relatives, an attractive countenance. Some of the past merit or demerit may still have effect at somne date in the future. Birth The basic character of a child, the sex, its position in the family, and its innate abilities are dependent upon the amount of merit that was active when conception took place. Present At the moment that a person performs a morally just deed, attends a ceremony, or is otherwise in close contact with a primary source of beneficial power, he increases his chance of immediate rewards-but in any case, he favorably influences his total balance of merit and demerit. Immediate Not long after gaining merit, there is a good chance that things go well-the future harvest may turn out abundant, the price of rice may be increased by the govern- ment, or at least illness and bad luck may be averted. Death At the moment of death, a person ought to try to activate his store of merit by thinking of ceremonies attended, by uttering Pali words, or by considering the time when he was a monk, in order to ensure a favorable rebirth. Future lives The course that future lives will take depends to a great extent on the configuration of dharmas of an individual when he is ready for rebirth. Relatives may influence the configuration in a favorable manner by elaborate ceremonies during the crema- tion, and by regularly sending some merit to those already deceased. evidence goes much further in delineating the relation between the two concepts. Merit can be seen as a beneficial and protective force which extends over a long period of time, and which links individuals together. The ideas concerning the role of merit in the life cycle are put into a time perspective in Table II. Merit has a long-term effect; the protective magical power, however, can be seen as the immediate, specifically temporary aspect of merit. Therefore, the concepts of merit and power of a specific kind are intimately linked. It must be noted, however, that it is only the beneficial power which is thus connected with merit. The most aggressive magical forces can often be associated with demerit. Therefore, through the actions of the monks-which generate power-results may be obtained for the immediate future, and at the same time, long-term changes are ensured by the increase in the store of merit. Although analysis of historical data may suggest quite different developments, to the farmers it is no coincidence that the most crucial period of the agricultural cycle falls at the time that religious activities in the monastery are at their peak. The frequent chanting and meditation sessions of the group of monks can have a good influence on the growth of rice and the abundance of the rains. Even if the circumstances happen to be unfavorable for the farmers, the religious activity may have warded off a worse situation. Similarly, a layperson attending a religious ceremony will surely gain some merit for a future life. This does not prevent him from assuming, however, that his chances to win a prize in the lottery are at their best immediately after having obtained some merit. In this light, a remark of a famous Thai monk becomes understandable:</page><page sequence="12">402 B. J. TERWIEL September 26, I968, Wadphodog. After the long sermon the total amount of money that was collected was made public and the preacher blessed the crowd. His blessing ended with the words: "May all of you win the lottery this week.'' The manner in which ideas about beneficial power and merit intermingle illustrate how the Buddhist concepts are incorporated in the farmers' religion. In a similar way, it can be seen how the five precepts are part of the Wadsaancaw belief system. These are not only the moral code that guides some lay behavior, but they have also become a sacred formula which purifies the laypersons at the beginning of a ritual.'8 Religious Orientations The religion of Wadsaancaw is by no means unique. lThroughout central Thailand, the same beliefs and rituals can be found. There is a remarkable uniformity of rural religion in central Thailand, which is probably related to the fact that farmers often participate in religious events in monasteries other than the one close to their home. They attend major ceremonies in many monasteries sometimes as members of a delegation from their village, on other occasions as private individuals. All contributions to a fundraising event are carefully written down, and each donor may expect a reciprocal gesture in the future. An intricate network of obligations thus links people to monasteries throughout the region. Looking at rural Thailand as a whole, some minor variation in ritual detail can be observed. However, the same animistic principles are shared by the unsophisticated population of agricultural regions in the whole country. J. Brohm noticed a similar ani- mistic religion in rural Burma.'9 On the other hand, the educated Buddhists who usually live in municipal agglomerations appear to have a fundamentally different religious orientation. Only among the educated classes can be found an appreciation of the philosophical and practical consequences of the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama. The subtle messages of the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the unraveling of the conditions and mental states that cause people to imagine a ''self'' such ideas are only for the learned; the average person in rural circumstances has no access to such matters. Recognition of a distinction between unsophisticated Buddhism and the Buddhism of the educated people is often implied in the literature.20 However, it is not often clearly stated that there is a fundamental difference between the interpretation of Buddhism of the farmer and that of a member of the educated elite. lThus, in my opinion, it can only be said about the villagers that they "do not feel that they are members of several different religious systems at the same time.' '21 The sophisticated urban Buddhist may well feel that there is a discrepancy between the Great lTradition and the manifold accretions. These two fundamentally different approaches can probably be found in all Theravada Buddhist countries. Table III represents an attempt to characterize and circumscribe the two different approaches. 18 See my ''The Five Precepts and Ritual in Rural Thailand, ''Journal of the Siam Society, LX, I (I973), pp. 333-43. 19 ''Buddhism and Animism in a Burmese Vil- lage,'' JAS, XXII, 2 (I963), pp. I55-67. 20 For example, Phra Sararas, My Country That- land: Its History, Geography, and Civilization (Tokyo: Maruzen, I942), pp. 248-49; Mendelson (n. 3 above), pp. I06-07; Ames (n. 7 above), pp. 40-4I; C.

It is an incomplete model which probably can be developed further. For example, members of the quickly expanding middle class could probably be divided into one section that adheres closely to the animist religion and another section that is basically com- partmentalized. In addition, the compartmentalized beliefs of sophisticated urban Bud- dhists cover a range of religious approaches, from the sceptical to the deeply involved. It appears certain, however, that those studying the rapid changes in the religious orienta- tions of Buddhists can benefit by noting that there is a fundamental difference between the animistic Buddhism of the farmers and the Buddhism of the sophisticated elite. Some of the controversies in the literature on the practice of Buddhism may be proven non-issues when Buddhist society is not looked at as a monolithic body of believers. Some of the "syncretists" (such as de Young, Ingersoll, Anuman Rajadhon and Wright) may have had the unsophisticated farmer in mind when they wrote about the undistinguishable mixture of traditions. "Compartmentalists" such as Wales, Amyot, Rabibhadana and Bunnag may well have had access to quite different sections of the population, and reflect the position of the Buddhist elite in their works. Of course the model I have presented cannot solve the scholars' oppositions that arise out of different theoretical approaches. For example, those who set out to study the practice of Buddhism expecting that it will conform closely to a picture derived from a study of the Pali canon can hardly avoid a compartmentalization between "pure" Buddhism and accretions, regardless of the class of people among whom they gather information. I believe my model may be useful when applied to the history of Buddhism in Southeast Asia. Too often the development of religion is depicted as a phenome- non that concerns the ruling class only. H. Bechert,22 who notices a dichotomy between farmers and rulers in thirteenth and fourteenth century Cambodia, is a notable exception. The two fundamentally different approaches to Buddhism of the model proposed above may well originate from the very first introduction of Buddhism in the rural scene. 22 "Living Buddhism in East Bengal: A Comparative View,' mimeographed, n.d., p. 22.</page></plain_text>
