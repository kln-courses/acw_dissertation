<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jeff Smith Careening Through Kubrick's Space The aerial shots that introduce the mountain setting of Stanley Kub rick's latest movie, The Shining, sweep across a hilly landscape, recalling the penultimate, "Star Gate" sequence of his 2001: A Space Odyssey. The difference is that this terrain, unlike the one astronaut David Bowman surveyed from his space pod, looks like Earth; the view favors pine green and 'Turner sunlight"1 over the discordant hues ofthat alien planetscape. But sharp colors and out lines as well as the reference to 2001 lend this land its own feeling of alienness. We might guess that Kubrick once again is taking us to a hotel, there to see a man transformed, again by "aliens"?but aliens who, like the landscape, will prove all the more sinister for their surface familiarity, and contact with whom promises nothing so climactic as in 2001. Indeed, such contact marks only the beginning of the Odyssey in this film. In that respect the sequence also recalls the first trip "out" in 2001, which Kubrick devoted to a visual study of man's world and its technological annexes. The dual reference collapses two spaces into one: Earth and home base are otherworld and destination here, and man's effects, by implication, lie all before us. They are the landscape itself with its perspectival distortion and attendant im manence of the alien. If the man in the car below is our new as tronaut, his upward trek through the mountains occurs within the landscape, of which he remains only a tiny part. The astronaut is not, therefore, up above, mediating our view of the landscape. We follow convention in taking this godlike vantage for granted, a bit of audacity that Kubrick both encourages and 62</page><page sequence="2">intends to punish. For with the arrival of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) at the Overlook Hotel, and the formal acknowledgement of aliens in banal chatter congruent with Hey wood Floyd's studied opacity, troubling points of view multiply. Confined within walls, the camera virtually becomes an independent consciousness, defy ing efforts to assign perceptions to the minds of characters. Things "shine," and the first sequence appears in retrospect as the primeval innocence from which we have been permanently expelled into a world of ambiguity and terror. In other words, The Shining again finds Kubrick thematically occupied with God, sin, and redemption, in a narrative less linear than visually and even mythically suggestive.2 Resonating in a pri mal (collective?) unconscious, its images involve and implicate us in the narrative in the same way the Overlook enmeshes Jack?and the more so as those images take anthropoid shapes wholly absent from 200rs cold monoliths. The horror of these aliens lies precisely in their intimacy with us and with the characters. In terms of genre, the two Alms's common interest in themes that each develops differently makes sense. Alienness, understood as those forces that inhabit and animate the world outside man, is a common stock of science fiction and "horror." Its obverse, technology?man's means for self-extension into that world?also charges both types of narrative, as does the central issue of "space" viewed broadly as the sphere of human existence defined by the interplay of technology and alienness. 2001 as science fiction trans literates these notions; its principal motifs are extraterrestrial life, machinery, and outer space. But I propose that The Shining must be acknowledged as in the deepest sense another, very distinctive "space" movie. Its basic project, distinguishing it among Kubrick's films generally and especially those that have followed 2001, is to explore the issue, recurrent in Kubrick, of people-as-environments (and vice-versa) as a concrete relationship tenable within a very specific environment. It is that specificity, the reduction of "envi ronment" from a whole society to a lonely hotel, that points to the character of "space" itself as the film's chief concern. The Shining"s use of horror conventions?haunted houses, de moniac possession, extrasensory experience, the animation of dead things?at once begins to qualify this concern. The film intends to focus its study of alienness, space, and technology on the super naturally evil; on entrapping spaces alive with unnatural forces; and on human power wrenched from reality (by visions or insanity) and set in opposition or in service to these dark forces. This new focus distinguishes Kubrick's use of the horror genre as itself a thematic 63</page><page sequence="3">development beyond 2007. But as usual Kubrick also subverts generic conventions.3 "Shining" itself functions far differently in the film than in Stephen King's novel,4 on which Kubrick and Diane Johnson based their screenplay. In the novel it serves as straight forward extrasensory perception, a kind of dream or thought through which Jack Torrance's five-year-old, Danny (Danny Lloyd), makes contact with the Overlook's netherworld. Danny's assimila tion of that world extends his role as the hinge element of his trauma-ridden family; with parents Jack and Wendy (Shelley Duvall) near divorce and Jack in need of work and only precariously off the bottle, the Overlook, where Jack signs on as off-season caretaker, looms as the key to future happiness or failure. Decisions and agonies about staying there follow a rational calculus of shared needs, and the hotel's terrible surprises show up as unforeseeable terms in the calculation?or, in Jack's own metaphor, dangerous wasps lurking in the crevices of life. To "shine" is to stick one's hand in those crevices, to expose oneself to maddening stings but also to gain awareness of the threat in a concrete, visible form. Shining is a technology that mediates between mind and environ ment throughout the novel. It can do this because the novel's primary data are thoughts; we experience the hotel through the minds of the Torrances. We see from the inside out. By contrast, Kubrick's data lie outside charac ter, in the walls, doors, and even empty spaces of the Overlook itself. Physical surfaces serve as points of access to character, and character, by implication, coextends far more intimately with its surroundings than is true in the novel. Where King "shines" us across the gap between mental and physical promontories, Kubrick's narrative game cultivates our incapacity to classify im ages and thus even define the gap. Shining becomes the disarrange ment of surfaces that accounts for the lack of definition; it reflects not an extension of mind beyond time, space, and physical reality, but rather the confounding of knowledge that follows from just those physical limits. Kubrick's added bits all serve this aesthetic of confusion. These include the multiplication and metamorphosis of apparitions Jack sees in the forbidden Room 237, and the remarkable tracking shot in which what looks like Jack's viewpoint on a table model becomes, with no cut, an overhead shot of the Overlook's real garden labyrinth. "Tony," the psychic progenitor of Danny's visions, changes from a visible, bounded dream figure in the novel to a much more problematic presence, a mechanical voice that threatens to hijack Danny's self. What we call "Danny" in the film is itself a 64</page><page sequence="4">physical surface?images and sounds?that we must penetrate from the outside in. Nothing in King anticipates that voice's appalling announcement: "Danny's not here, Mrs. Torrance," suggesting Danny's own expulsion, along with ours, from his inner self. That suggestion supplies the film's most chilling twist?the victimization of characters by their own psyches. "Shining" for Kubrick does not merely reveal threats to the self but becomes one with them, even as it more firmly integrates itself with character. In fact, it is the loss of definition between the character and his power that spells trouble. Danny's autism not only cuts him off (a//e?-ates) him but, in so doing, fragments the family further into a bundle of mutual mysteries?reversals of its role in the novel. Likewise for Jack's "power," his writing. Jack's quest for stability through writ ing stands in the novel as the family's hope; the sound of his type writer in the intimate family quarters signals his sobriety and in dustriousness, and it ceases only when trouble starts to unfold. But Kubrick puts the typewriter on a long, empty table in the Overlook's long, empty, sterile lobby, in perfect, cold symmetry with the hotel's space. Jack's compulsive peckings, which echo down the corridors in a stark equation of sound and space, index his gradual break down. The relentlessly mechanical sound, issuing/rom the activity of character rather than trying to drown it out, replaces King's howling wind as the hotel's menacing voice. By collapsing the dynamic moral outlook Jack's writing repre sents in the novel to that sound, a mere physical surface, Kubrick again sets us up for a shock. Wendy discovers that Jack's product consists of only a single phrase, typed thousands of times and changing only in format. Jack's insane activity reduces wholly to its own form and routine, and issues in more nonsensical surfaces significant only in their cumulative impact. Rifling the pages desper ately for some hint of coherence, some referential meaning, Wendy models our viewing of the film itself, whose reality finally consists in the interstices of jumbled surfaces. Perhaps what Jack has been "writing" is the movie itself. Certainly the writing act, like Jack's obsession with his role as caretaker, expresses Jack in his close identity with the setting and its spirits: equilibrium as pre-existing condition, not goal. King sees the Overlook as the "clockwork" that relentlessly discomposes people's lives; but for Kubrick, clockwork is a quality of people. It is the way they fit themselves to, and in effect become, their environments. Technological self-extension and self expression, by defining character, also limit it. Thus, Danny's "play"?earnest circuits around the hotel's corridors on his tri 65</page><page sequence="5">cycle, whose rumbling on floors and carpets becomes another characteristic sound?becomes as serious and self-justifying a task as Jack's "work." And Jack needs no rationale for the manic de dication to duty he expresses; the role, a surface, contains all that he is. Where surfaces are essences and existence equals routine, it is precisely these inherent tendencies of character that account for the fearful and the threatening. Kubrick underscores this point by giving Jack scant back ground, even while casting an actor ten years older than the novel's protagonist. Jack Nicholson portrays a character not, at 30, teeter ing on the edge of a vocation, but rather at 40 well along in cynicism, dissolution, and failure. He brings to the role a history of characteri zations combining suggestions of affability and menace, which Kubrick exploits by refusing to reveal a single inner core. And as a group, the film's actors never "click" in the conventional way; they begin and end as individual motes, and instead of disintegrating, their relationships play themselves out to the full initial potential of each. In all, Kubrick refuses to externalize the human condition, a stance that suggests the vast gulf between his outlook and that of the genre King's novel represents. For Kubrick the horror lies in the structure of daily existence itself. It is not just what might be lurking around a given corner, but the many corners themselves and the unavoidability of turning them. The replacement of live hedge ani mals with a garden labyrinth not only solves a technical problem but perfectly expresses this worldview: the "outdoor" threat becomes a reflection of indoor space and even more obviously shows that space leading nowhere. It represents a passive threat?not devout ment, but simply loss of self down paths that, even when correctly chosen, can only double back on themselves. Naturally, Kubrick drops the happy ending. The kinds of hor rors he presents cannot really be evaded. Wendy and Danny may nominally escape, but not to anything clearly better. And the hotel stays intact. Kubrick's ending is one of ice, not fire. That the ultimate bleakness of the vision, and the narrative collapse of man, space, and aliens into coextensive entities, imply each other is a point we can see more clearly by comparing The Shining with other films about space and aliens. In a Newtonian cosmos, space lies thoroughly detached from consciousness; it can therefore be a safe and exciting sphere of discovery or conquest, mediated by a technology that serves as a tool of adventure. Tradi tional science fiction expresses this outlook, one that permits life to coexist with aliens and machines at little risk to human identity. 66</page><page sequence="6">Thus the stability of humanness in films like Star Trek?The Motion Picture and Close Encounters of the Third Kind,5 two other work ings of alienness and space themes that, though released at about the same time as The Shining, index an utterly different cosmology. Star Trek is notable for using all of 200V s major motifs (machine intelli gence, the search for a creator, and the notion of "rebirth") in reverse. Here the universe is so ordered and (American) man so perfect that the alien/machine stands in need of his transforming power, not vice-versa. For that matter, man's own technical culture, his most advanced tools and organizations, submits to rule by per sonal whim and idiosyncracy. The great universe is deistic?that is, God reassuringly exists but politely stays out of things?and expan sive, ensuring boundless progress made possible by a stable, trans national social order. By design, Star Trek's world resembles one mythic rendering of the youthful American Republic. Close Encounters picks up where this film leaves off, trans muting the eighteenth-century boundless prospect into nineteenth century imperialism?though conceding, at least, the greater power to the aliens, whose presence convincingly animates human space. Steven Spielberg's movie serves up a kind of colonialist fantasy, affirming contact between "higher" and "lower" cultures and de claring for ready acceptance by the lower. Only full compliance, mystically attainable through childlike innocence or cultural simplicity (the film recalls cults of genius and the "noble savage") permits one the reward of riding along. "When You Wish Upon A Star," the movie's theme, expresses the developmental issue: childlike faith may come first, but the point finally lies in removing the matter from the realm of faith, in making dreams "come true." Pinocchio, after all, preaches against fibbing and in the end points toward growing up. Thus the scientists at the end await, as one says, "the first day of school." This handling of alienness and identity finds its broad pr? figuration in Arthur C. Clarke's novel Childhood's End.6 In that book the descent of flying saucers eventually leads to an even more resplendent climax, a spiritual annexation of the whole race. Of course, Clarke served Kubrick as co-scenarist on 2001, and we might read motifs like the "Star Child's" birth as solitary echoes of Childhood's End. But returning even to this more hopeful of Kubrick's narratives immediately plunges us into visions of com paratively profound ambivalence and ambiguity. 200Ts aliens offer no personal access (Kubrick abandoned thoughts of filming a Close Encounters-type ending) as do the stock aliens provided by Spiel berg and Clarke, including those described in Clarke's early treat 67</page><page sequence="7">ments for 2007.7 Rather, Kubrick works with the notion that man's technology?which includes his character as well as his prod ucts?may be its own problem. HAL, Kubrick's supercomputer cum-psychopath, clearly stands as a receptacle or even replacement for human identity. He expresses pride and self-sufficiency, the bases for identity in any conscious creature but also the deadliest of sins in both classical and Christian thought, His existence thus questions the very basis of identity, and in the process poses a most problematic view of space: as a means toward human mastery of the latter, he almost undoes the human masters. Within 2007's narrative framework, this motif supports a view of the self and its possibilities redolent of Calvinist doctrine and its artistic cousin, Metaphysical poetry. Essentially, this view consid ers the universe not a mechanical system but an organism whose ordering principle or "soul" corresponds to man's mind even as it transcends it; and it considers human nature ambivalent and self defeated, weakest in its very strengths: But O alas, so long, so farre Our bodies why doe wee forbeare? They'are ours, though they'are not wee, Wee are Th'intelligences, they the spheare.8 Kubrick persistently explores the relationships, within and between self and cosmos, of "intelligences" to "spheares." And on this point 2007, at least formally, endorses a Calvinist hope for organic resurrection as a product of higher agencies and of man's own striving?at least that striving which follows destruction of the old, proud self.9 One can easily see the fundamental contrasts between this and the "classic" view just outlined. 2007 only begins to suggest the synonymy of aliens, man, technology, and space; even so, it clearly spurns Newtonian assumptions about both the cosmos and human potential. But understanding this mainly lets us see just how much further along these lines The Shining proceeds. From the outset, The Shining's reduction of "environment" to a particular place suggests a different outlook. Elimination of 2007 's visual expansiveness leaves a "space" that, though superficially vast?clearly too big for its three winter occupants?both physically and psychologically imprisons. Richard Jameson gauges the uni verse that Kubrick, this time, posits beyond "Earth" and the open ing sequence: 68</page><page sequence="8">The sterility of its vastness, the spaces that proliferate yet really connect with each other in a continuum that encloses rather than releases, frustrates rather than liberates?all this becomes an extension of [Jack's] own barrenness of mind and spirit.10 Thus the many doors that open only onto more hotel, and the mir rors, deceptively breaching or enlarging space, that really turn one's view inward and collapse the prospect of space back into itself: the equation of space and the self in a paradox of identity pers?v?rant from Narcissus to No Exit. Similarly with time: the film's titles mark off a temporal flow that, by contrast with2001 's, particularizes events and funnels them into successively tapered time frames?days, then hours. The pro spect of time hinges on and almost seems to generate human activ ity; though signifying little (What "Saturday"?), the titles interpose themselves at points with what otherwise would be superfluous fre quency. The Overlook cannot even boast a real history, since the ghosts of events as long past as the struggle over Indian burial grounds on the site finally reduce to a single constituent event, an eternal homicide. Jack's affinity for the place?confirmed when he gives his "goddamned soul" for the ghostly barkeep's eucharistie ministra tions?gradually shears away his self, leaving him no more than the latest living agent of this event. (An important contrast with the novel, where Jack falls victim to straight demoniac infestation.) Space, time, and Jack's self all seem to reach their vanishing points in the freezing enclosure ofthat constricting garden labyrinth. But a final shot tracks once more through an indoor hallway?describing it, at last, all the way to the end, where the hotel's compass dissolves altogether into the non-space and frozen instant of a photograph showing Jack impossibly present at a 1921 Overlook ball. The pic ture seems a fulfillment of the words of a former hotelkeeper' s ghost: "You, Mr. Torrance, have always been the caretaker." But this is really to say that the final image deconstructs in retrospect this whole narrative of constriction. Belying what it seems to finish, the photo reveals that Jack's transformation was complete, in a way, from the outset. Photography only reveals what already exists. It is important to see this ending as reversing 200Ts validating an apotheosis that is neither climax nor rebirth. David Bowman's transformation preceded a departure from the Regency suite and presumed return to Earth; Jack's is his return. Corre spondingly, Jack's change does not follow but is his journey through 69</page><page sequence="9">space. Like Bowman, Jack is man joined to the universe?but a confined, artificial universe, union with which represents not the end product of a spiritual pilgrimage but its long-standing process. The Shining's end indicates that the hotel encloses the whole narrative. Hence, Jack's essence is his disintegration, the essentially photographic meshing of states of existence pointed up by the final shot but effected throughout by "shining." It is an essence insepar able from its own disclosure or medium. This deeply photographic character of what the narrative unfolds implicates those of us who watch. Photography is an instrument of both disclosure and illusion, as well as a way of seeing: in other words, it "shines." As the chief technology of cinema, it makes possible the illusions and dis locations out of which the narrative arises; and "narrative" is the mediation between audience and filmed events, that which calls forth and gives significance to those events. In the same way, "shining" functions within the narrative as the characters' technol ogy for coming in contact with the environment, calling forth its spirits and assimilating themselves to it. As a conspiracy of the two technologies (and as a final piece of both disclosure and confusion), the last shot equates Jack's spiritual odyssey/breakdown and our viewing of the film. It is Kubrick's last assault on our narrativity? our complicity in storymaking?and places us in relation to Jack as Jack is to the aliens. We call forth the film just as Jack calls forth his fate. And as Jack's condition pre-exists, so the whole story, ac cording to this ending, only fancifully seemed to develop to this point. It was really given all along in the structure of its medium, which includes our construing of images as well as their material bases. This ending is an anticlimax in the deepest sense. It fulfills the story's promises and brings narrative choice to an end, but in the sense of completing a breakdown of certainty and emphasizing the artificiality of choice. Both literal space (the Overlook) and imagina tive space (the story)?our "world" as well as Jack's?collapse to that common, flat black-and-whiteness. The narrative retreats into the box it came from, the camera. These modernist tricks of self-reflexivity in art invariably suggest a final audience condition of either ironic detachment from or radical assimilation to events, while also showing how fine a line separates the two. Kubrick opts to leave us on the side of radical assimilation, immersed in this view of life as horror film. The point of his film is to lead us inward, where the horrors reside?and where we go to find movies. Constriction of space serves this end; for us, as for Jack, peering into such space is peering into the self. But it 70</page><page sequence="10">also describes a wholly modern universe. If the modern-dress drama of 2001 researched a seventeenth-century sensibility, it also replaced the Calvinist God with aliens that, though terribly advanced, at least implicitly belonged to man's order of creation, if not altogether to his inner being. It is not far from this outlook to The Shining's still more problematic relation of aliens and man, its utterly post-Newtonian meshing of the two in a thoroughly anthropomorphic space. (And not surprisingly so: the "Metaphysical" worldview fed quite di rectly into the making of much modernist thought.) With The Shin ing Kubrick fully develops the most forbidding implications of his own long-standing worldview, and in a work addressed, like 2001, directly to the theme of man's relation to the universe. Structurally, he accomplishes the task by making a whole story based on 2001 's middle section, the space journey. The new "astro nauts" have no universe except their claustrophic spaceship, where relationships begun in uneasy balance gradually break down into menace and terror. Jack serves as the HAL aboard this ship. His degenerate sense of duty and integrity blocks Wendy's supposed efforts to "jeopardize this mission," and in savaging her request that they leave the Overlook, Jack betrays his hysterical, HAL-like fear of disconnection. Many other motifs suggest a parallel identification of Danny and Wendy with Discovery's astronauts, the passengers and victims whose suspicions ignite the ship's crisis. But a crucial difference arises in The Shining out of the inseparability of space and spaceship, goal and journey. Jack ultimately also fills David Bow man's spacesuit; even more than in 2001, man is his technology, and hence the computer can be neither unplugged nor wished destruc tion. The temporary disconnection merely marks arrival at an essential plane of being. Utterly depraved, man victimizes himself, and since Spaceship Overlook has no "space" to move in except itself, this voyage never ends. In other words, The Shining depicts a chaotic and relativistic universe devoid of higher agencies, one whose very size and empti ness infuriatingly underscore human limitations and forever con demn man to endure his own grotesque self. Space, technology, and aliens constitute this universe but nowhere are objectified and rendered "safe"; and with God displaced, the weak and conflicted self known to the seventeenth century comes to center position, doomed to the endless deceptions of its own doors and mirrors. What earlier eras and classic science fiction account a Faustian interest in at least some kind of transcendence becomes (as it is for many modernists) a chilling picture of self-satisfied human "striv ing" toward indenture to the demons of the Id. The devil's pact 71</page><page sequence="11">offers no reward in a universe where certainty of knowledge is not possible. Man defines himself existentially only by his own de humanizing actions?hence Jack's ultimate reduction to pure act, and his likely readiness to anoint yet another as having "always" been the caretaker. The obvious parallel with No Exit has been noted,11 but perhaps not the even more apparent metaphor Kubrick himself plants. Danny's "Roadrunner" cartoons, another aural "surface," capture this modernist worldview with perfect irony.12 Built on even less plot than most cartoons, they repetitiously chronicle the struc turally very similar efforts of Wile E. Coyote to devour the Road runner. With his sly grin and technological craftiness, the coyote resembles Jack, or what Jack comes to represent. Endlessly beaten, yet always reappearing, and neither repentant nor concerned with transcending his condition, Wile E. fails of any redemption. And on this the cartoon depends. It would cease to be if he succeeded. Like creatures of Sartre, Coyote and Roadrunner exist only in this relationship to each other. Jack's "fall" through contact with his space-as-self recalls a classic "Roadrunner" bit in which Wile E. Coyote, intent on pur suit, obliviously races past the edge of a cliff. There he stays sus pended until the realization hits that nothing supports him from below. At the moment of recognition, he falls. We may see the coyote's situation as our own at the outset of The Shining, when we hung high above things, oblivious as to the source of our vantage? and how, since that "consoling" moment, we have been "careening through space."13 The onset of our fall, too, accompanies self consciousness, which in cinematic terms is our projection of "self onscreen, our willing effort to assimilate ourselves to given charac ters and viewpoints. Man's viewing man is the essence of his sinful state, or, in modern terms, the revelation and result of his prob lematic existence. Kubrick throws the sin back at us by using "the simplest events in bright light" to "conjure dark fears, guesses and portents."14 These events root us to the action?the psychic self-mutilation of a version of ourselves with whom we at first dared hope to sympathize?in the usual way of horror stories, but with distinctly modernist implications. We lose, like No Exit's wretched charac ters, the option of closing our eyes. The modern image of overexposure to things15 has always found very concrete, visual uses in Kubrick's films. Those glaring, artificial lights that bathe all his human habitations, from chateaus to War Rooms to Moonbases to prisons, and now even garden mazes, 72</page><page sequence="12">render human activity and its contradictions as starkly overapparent at the Overlook as anywhere, and with less chance than ever of escape back into "nature" (which itself seems forbiddingly in candescent). In that light?the light of movies?Jack cannot help encountering inner forces and spirits, nor we our lowest fears and desires. Jack's fate attaches itself to the whole depraved audience,16 which in the end stays behind with him?somewhere in the terrible, neon-lit space of its own consciousness. NOTES Renard T. Jameson's phrase, from "Kubrick's Shining" (review essay), Film Comment, Vol. 16, No. 4 (July/Aug. 1980), p. 28, col. 1. 2Of 2001, Kubrick has said, "I tried to create a visual experience, one that bypasses verbal pigeonholing and directly penetrates the subconscious with an emo tional and philosophic content" and that would "resonate within the deepest fibers of one's being" (emphasis his). See "Playboy Interview: Stanley Kubrick," repr. in Jerome Agel, ed., The Making of Kubrick's 2001 (New York: Signet Film Series [New American Library], 1970), pp. 328-9. Several critics have analyzed 2001 as myth, including, recently, Be verle Houston and Marsha Kinder, in Self and Cinema (Pleasantville, N.Y.: Redgrave Publishing Co., 1980), pp. 304-313. These authors specifically note that200/'s universe is "not demonic" (p. 304); nonetheless, Kubrick is on record as having "confessed to a friend," at least two years before 200/'s release, "that he would like to make the world's scariest movie, involving a series of episodes that would play upon the nightmare fears of the audience." See Hollis Alpert, "Off-beat Director in Outer Space," New York Times Magazine, Jan. 16, 1966, p. 51. 3ln 2001 "Kubrick parodies the science fiction genre" (Houston and Kinder, p. 309)?specifically, according to Robert Phillip Kolker, by "changing] the genre's conventions about how the future will look."

Kubrick's use of child-symbols offers an interesting contrast with Spielberg's; far from linking it to a "cult of genius," Kubrick makes childhood vision a source of horror, Danny's tricycle (a prop used to demonstrate adult unimaginativeness in Close Encounters) becomes the vehicle of his growing knowl edge, and its movement a transcription of the Overlook's unending cycle of existence. The sound of "Roadrunner" cartoons becomes chilling in this world, where child hood, rather than suggesting innocence, is painted in Freudian colors: menacing father, instinctual repression, and the constant threat of severe psychic damage. 13Jameson, p. 30, col. 2. 14Mayersberg, p. 57, col. 1. 15For instance, compare Virginia Woolf s description of the modern world as seen by the title character in her novel Orlando: A Biography (New York: Harvest/ Harcourt Brace Jovanovich; original ed. 1928), a work whose playful presentation of a self with an interesting relationship to time and history suggests several points of contact with The Shining: In this same light everything near her showed with extreme distinctness.... the shadows of the plants were miraculously distinct. She noticed the separate grains of earth in the flower beds as if she had a microscope stuck to her eye. . . . She saw with disgusting vividness that the thumb on Joe's right hand was without a finger nail . . . The sight was so repulsive that she felt faint for a moment, but in that moment's darkness, when her eyelids flickered, she was relieved of the pressure of the present, (pp. 320-22). 16Since the ending here parallels (in fact, parodies) 2001 's, Jack's transformation and return into the shadow of his beginnings?dressed in the old clothes of his aliens, not himself "glowing" with organic newness?also hints at the birth of a new, but only perversely human-like race. 74</page></plain_text>
