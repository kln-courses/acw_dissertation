<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Journal of Modern African Studies, 19, 3 (1981), pp. 477-498 The Artist's Credo: the Political Philosophy of Wole Soyinka by ROBERT W. JULY* 'The artist has always functioned in African society', he said, 'the record of mores and experiences of his society and.. .the voice of vision in his own time. It is time', he concluded, 'for [the artist] to respond to this essence of himself.' The words appeared in mid-Ig967; their author Wole Soyinka, already celebrated as a leading poet and dramatist, representing the younger generation of writers among Africa's newly independent nations.1 It was a time of artistic flowering to match fresh-won independence, but it was not a time for serenity, let alone complacency. In Nigeria, Soyinka's homeland, a scant six years of freedom from colonial rule had brought political instability and venality in high places, followed by a military coup and civil violence that was destined to escalate into open and bloody civil war. South Africa still held its black population in an iron grip of tyranny, and regarded with a kindly eye those kindred regimes thriving in Rhodesia and the Portuguese colonies. Tyranny, however, was colour blind, and the concept of liberty seemed not to have survived the struggle against Europe's colonialism. For the most part, new nations soon adopted single-party governments, some benevolent, some brutal, all arbitrary, and increasingly dictatorial rule took the form of military regimes that initially sought to stem a growing tide of political instability, but remained to impose their sole authority by naked force. Where dissent had strength and numbers, violence erupted, and grinding civil wars in Chad and the Sudan, among others, paralleled the conflict in Nigeria. Widespread unrest took heavy toll in disease, hunger, and displaced persons. Disturbing statistics compiled by the United Nations suggested that one of every two hundred Africans was a refugee, either at home or abroad. Many citizens, too, were taken into custody by their own governments, and this, in fact, was Soyinka's fate. Imprisoned by the Nigerian military authorities in August 1967, he was held until September I969, * Professor of History, Graduate School and Hunter College, City University of New York. 1 Transition (Accra), 3 I, 7 June 1967, p. 13.</page><page sequence="2">478 ROBERT W. JULY never formally accused, certainly not charged and brought before a court of law, but apparently incarcerated on suspicion of sympathy for the Biafran rebellion that finally collapsed at the beginning of 1970. If there were any official hopes that imprisonment might have diluted the intensity of Soyinka's political beliefs or the firmness of his artistic commitment, these were rudely shattered two years later when he published his bitter account of prison experience, The Man Died. He was arrested, Soyinka flatly insisted, for trying to put an end to war, secession, and 'genocide-consolidated dictatorship'. Subjected to de- humanising confinement, he came within an ace of being assassinated for continuing this opposition from inside prison. 'The nation was humiliated', Soyinka concluded, 'by a treason promoted, sustained and accentuated by forces that lacked purpose or ideology beyond self-perpetuation through organized terror'.' This was strong talk, coming at war's end as the Nigerian nation sought to heal deep wounds, and as the administration of General Yakubu Gowon moved towards resumption of economic and social development so long interrupted. To its credit, the military Government did not react, and a year later Soyinka was able to reaffirm his credo in a calmer if no less dedicated vein: Where works of literature deal with eternal values... they provide merely a testament of the author's own vision... The exercise of the literary function may serve the writer... to keep in view what the ends of humanity are... In our own society especially it is essential to recognize this. At the moment literature and art can only function as a keep-in-view tray on a bureaucrat's desk. Once this is accepted, the writer does not fool himself into thinking that all is said and all is done that need be said and done. He holds himself in readiness.. .when the minutes in that file can be made a live project. No other attitude seems possible to me. Soyinka's conclusion was unequivocal: 'I do not believe in futile token twitches. '2 Certainly at this point in Soyinka's career, no one would have accused him of tokenism, yet it had long been clear that action was central to his art, that he had always lived out his convictions, to do something about inequity and injustice. In choosing the title of his prison notes Soyinka had said it all: 'The man dies... who keep[s] silent in the face of tyranny.'3 1 Wole Soyinka, The Man Died (London, 1972), pp. 18-19. 2 Transition, 42, I973, Pp. 62-3. 3 Soyinka, op. cit. p. I3.</page><page sequence="3">POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF WOLE SOYINKA THE WRITER AS POLITICAL ACTIVIST Soyinka's earlier writing had been mainly for the theatre, much of it actively political and often sharply critical of the African society on which it commented. In I960, Nigeria's year of independence, Soyinka returned home from several years of work and study in England. With him he brought the experience of having written and acted in plays for public production, and having endured the sharp edge of critical judgement. Apparently he also brought the ideas for A Dance of the Forests, an ambitious and complicated allegorical play, produced later that same year in Lagos in conjunction with Nigeria's independence celebrations. As commemoration for the birth of a major African nation, the play was a curious commentary, putting forward weak, corrupt, or murderous characters to represent the African present, and recalling a past history that featured not glorious achievement but violence and duplicity. Soyinka had his reasons for such an unpromising statement, and these may be seen in complexities of structure and scope that sought to project the essentials of an African world-view. Had the play been less involved and less obscure, however, it is safe to say there might have been a considerable public outcry against such a dim view of the re-emergence of independent Africa.1 A Dance of the Forests was as sober as it was obscure, but Soyinka's social criticism did not necessarily preclude the lighter touch. Dead seriousness remained at bottom, even a sense of outrage; nevertheless, a serious comment could sometimes be heightened by belly laugh or burlesque. Nigeria already had a tradition of itinerant playing companies that presented lively folk operas, usually in the vernacular or pidgin English, often with themes that commented in spirited fashion on the vagaries of contemporary public figures. Soyinka's interest in theatre reached out in many directions, seizing - among other things - the vehicle of political satire already thriving in his own Yoruba homeland. Using acting companies which he organised as a first step towards repertory theatre, Soyinka produced two reviews during I964 and 1965 that presented a series of short skits dealing topically with social and political questions. The early independence years in Nigeria and elsewhere had brought a full measure of economic muddle and political confusion, not infrequently accompanied by low comedy in high places. In his reviews Soyinka presented a line-up of corrupt or fatuous characters acting out his versions of current events, and subjected to 1 For two interpretations, see Eldred D.Jones, The Writing of Wole Soyinka (London, 1973), pp. 32-48, and Gerald Moore, Wole Soyinka (London, 1978 edn.), pp. 27-39. 479</page><page sequence="4">a relentless parody. Much of the humour has since failed to survive in its published form because, as Soyinka himself observed, the spontaneity of the moment, the topicality of material, the subtlety of voice and gesture, become lost in a printed text that had also to avoid the penalties of libel. A good example of effective satire that did not survive publication was a nicely crafted sketch dealing with the Nigerian census of I963. The census was widely suspect, not least because the surprisingly high numbers reported from the Northern Region provided the basis for the domination of the Federal legislature by the Northern People's Congress led by Abubakar Balewa, the Prime Minister, and Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto. The skit was brief but pitiless - a short spoken introduction, followed by several cameos in mime depicting census readings in the different Regions. The whole performance was deadpan, including the tallies for the North in which the officials solemnly counted occasional individuals filing past the census station preceded and followed by seemingly endless herds of cattle. Blackout.... Another piece of slapstick, 'Babuzu Lion Heart', dealt with a poltroon said to be a composite caricature of two or three African Presidents, who were favourite targets of Soyinka and probable models for his political play, Kongi's Harvest, staged in 1965, although in this case Kwame Nkrumah seems the most plausible victim. Like the revues, Kongi's Harvest contained much topical material that has not worn well, but it is also a substantial work with serious commentary on the nature of government in contemporary Africa, both modern and traditional. Indeed, the play pits these two systems against each other in a battle of wills and wits, saying much about the shortcomings of each, but ending on a note of uncertainty as the curtain descends. The story deals with the efforts of Kongi, an African dictator, to take from Oba Danlola the right to eat the harvest's first yam, a privilege belonging traditionally to the king and therefore symbolically important to a modern ruler. Kongi hopes to absorb and replace the king, and thereafter to turn the country towards a newer, more modern way of life. After some difficulty, the old Oba is forced to defer, and the yam ceremony is arranged for Kongi's benefit. During the course of the play, however, much of his modernising reforms are seen to be superficial and ill advised, his regime unpopular, his administration corrupt. At the climax of the harvest festival Kongi is presented with a covered platter containing...not the ceremonial first yam, as expected, but the head of a fugitive lately slain by the police. At the play's end it seems clear that the old way of life is over, but Kongi and his ersatz modernisation 480 ROBERT W. JULY</page><page sequence="5">POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF WOLE SOYINKA 48I have also been repudiated. Soyinka has pronounced sentence on the old and the new, and found each wanting, at least in the form of reactionary tradition or arbitrary dictatorship.1 What Soyinka offers in positive affirmation is less clear. There are other protagonists - the Oba's nephew rebelling against chiefly authority, and the tough-spirited daughter of the slain conspirator, both of whom seem to represent some promise for the future, if only the hope that there will always be those who struggle against tyranny. When it comes to ridiculing the pretentions of authority, however, Soyinka writes with a surer hand. There is a basic sympathy in his handling of the old Oba who is depicted as clever and scheming, but with a fundamental integrity rooted in his chiefly position. Indeed, his wily character seems more induced than intrinsic, forced upon him by the pressures of the new regime. Apparently manoeuvred into a public submission, Oba Danlola nevertheless proves himself a master dis- sembler. He makes a great show of preparing for the yam feast, but has no intention of attending. 'When the dog hides a bone does he not throw up sand?', the Oba demands of his nephew; 'A little dust in the eye of His Immortality...' His nephew protests. 'You gave your word.' This is child's play for the old man. 'You should, my son, when you deal in politics pay sharp attention to the word. I agreed only that I would prepare myself for the grand ceremony, not that I would go.' He will have a convenient heart attack, the Oba continues, or his oracle may forbid his leaving home on an unpropitious day. 'As the Man Himself has often screamed, we are a backward superstitious lot, immune to Kongi's adult education schemes.' The irony is ultimately futile. The Oba is obliged to attend the yam festival, his power subservient to that of Kongi, and in the long run broken by the rush of events. The Oba's fall, however, is not without dignity, for he is no mere time server and no usurper. He is a chief of the people by right of succession. He will remain, whatever his fate. No such dignity is reserved for the dictator, who is branded coward, bully, fool, and opportunist. Kongi is a slogan-monger who preaches pretentious nonsense called positive scientificism - 'ideograms in al- gebraic quantums' - an obvious reference to Nkrumah's pseudo- scientific tract, Consciencism. He is a poseur who postures for effect, and has his books ghost written- another dig at Nkrumah. He is a power-hungry tyrant whose authority rests ultimately on force and fear; 1 Wole Soyinka, Before the Blackout (Ibadan, I97I); Kongi's Harvest, in his Collected Plays, 2 (London, I974).</page><page sequence="6">a madman not so mad that he does not recognise the eventual brittleness of his regime, and the inevitability of his popular rejection and downfall. Long before the play's end, Soyinka has dismissed Kongi and his kind: Imprecations then, curses on all inventors of agonies, on all Messiahs of pain and false burdens... On all who fashion chains, on farmers of terror, on builders of walls, on all who guard against the night but breed darkness by day, on all whose feet are heavy and yet stand upon the world... On all who see, not with the eyes of the dead, but with eyes of Death.l Serious message aside, Kongi's Harvest was good theatre. There was much to laugh at. It provided an enjoyable evening of entertainment, and if its style was farcical, its point of view ironic, so much the better. Did Soyinka have something similar in mind late that same year, 1965, in connection with a mysterious incident that occurred at the Ibadan studio of the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation? The times were unsettled. There was economic malaise and political turbulence in the country, especially in the Western Region where there had been a state of emergency for three years. The political circumstances were complex, but in essence they reflected antagonisms among the Yoruba that dated back a century or more. An intramural struggle for power had developed between Chief Obafemi Owolowo, leader of the Action Group, and his former lieutenant and Regional Premier, Chief Samuel I. Akintola, who had formed the rival Nigerian National Democratic Party. In the regional election held in October 1965, Atkintola was the apparent winner, but there was widespread suspicion of election fraud, later substantiated, and the resultant violence that burst forth throughout the Region reflected popular outrage, and brought orderly government to a virtual standstill. These were the circumstances that served as a backdrop for the antic events that unfolded at the Ibadan radio station on an October day in I965. Accounts varied somewhat, but the essentials were the same. The evening news broadcast had just ended. This was to be followed by a pre-recorded tape address by Akintola, his first public statement since the election. Suddenly there was a pause in the transmission, then instead of the Premier another voice was heard in rough imitation, shouting party slogans and inviting Akintola to resign. A masked gunman had entered the studio moments before, commandeered the Akintola tapes and substituted his own. The incident was widely ascribed to Soyinka; at any rate it bore the earmarks of his style - a serious gesture acted out as a rowdy jape. The escapade might have had 1 Kongi's Harvest, p. 99. 482 ROBERT W. JULY</page><page sequence="7">POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF WOLE SOYINKA 483 serious consequences as well, for Soyinka was arrested on suspicion, but there was no solid evidence and he was subsequently acquitted at trial.1 Here then was Soyinka playing out his role as active participant in the events of the day, going beyond the written word, beyond his 'few token twitches'. And if the incident provided no more than a humorous stress mark to the sobering events of the day, neither did it act as a deterrent to further adventures. Within a year Soyinka once more moved directly into a sensitive area of public affairs. This time the consequences were far more serious. By 1966 the political crisis in Nigeria had deepened dramatically. An army coup in January resulted in the assassination of several leading politicians, including Chief Akintola, the Federal Prime Minister, and Ahmadu Bello who was Premier of the Northern Region. It also brought to power a military government, and set in motion events that culminated in May 1967 with the secession of the largely Ibo Eastern Region as the independent Republic of Biafra. The Nigerian civil war had begun. Soyinka's reaction was aggressive, predictable. Quickly he accepted the January 1966 coup as the basis for a sweeping, much-needed national reform. It was a pre-emptive strike, he reasoned, neutralising the military intervention that had been planned by Akintola and Bello to shore up the former's slipping control of the West. Hence the coup, however dubious its origins, could be the basis for genuine reform. When, in May 1966, the military regime headed by General Aguiyi Ironsi decreed an end to the semi-autonomous regions in favour of a centralised state, Soyinka rejoiced.' It was a bold revolutionary decision', he later recalled, 'combatting a corrupt and proliferating bureau- cracy... destroying tribalism and fomenting a single sense of nationhood.' Characteristically, Soyinka combined conviction with action, more quixotic than practical. The goal he envisioned was an egalitarian democratic society of all Nigerians, the means a leadership of intellectuals and trade unionists, exploiting the opportunities supplied by the January coup. On the urging of Lt.-Colonel A. Fajuyi, the Military Governor of the West, Soyinka travelled north on the heels of the Ironsi unity decree, intent upon enlisting northern liberal support. He returned frightened and disillusioned. He had arrived in time to witness the 1 West Africa (London), I January 1966, p. 22; Daily Times (Lagos), i8 October 1965; The Man Died, pp. I55-6.

Disillusionment was soon subjected to further shock. In June, Ironsi was overthrown and assassinated along with Fajuyi, and a new military regime headed by Colonel Yakubu Gowon, came to power, the creature, Soyinka was certain, of that same Northern 'Mafia' that operated in co-operation with its Lagos counterparts. Now the army was securely in the hands of the old gang of plunderers, but there were still demands for investigation of corruption, still cries for reform, still those who remained committed to the revolutionary ideals of a free and equitable society. The 'Mafia', however, was entrenched, Soyinka explained, ready to secure its own survival, to pursue its own sordid goals. Genocide was the instrument, Soyinka pointed out, a new pogrom combined with a renewed call for national unity. In September the Ibos living in the North were set upon again in a massacre that dwarfed previous outbursts, the survivors sent reeling to the East, homeward from their residences and jobs, their minds turning towards ideas of secession that soon became a reality. Other dissidents were included in the sweep, but 'it was the Ibos who were the unqualified victims'. It was an infamous day. 'When the East seceded', Soyinka concluded, 'they left us the Mafia and the Military in an unbreakable alliance of mutual, lucrative guilt... As for further hopes of building anything approaching a socialist state...'. Soyinka did not remain in this uncertain, defeatist frame of mind. By August 1967, he was back in action, visiting Benin and Enugu, attempting to secure nothing less than an end to the Biafran secession, he said; intent upon subverting the war effort, his accusers insisted, planning the overthrow of the Federal Government, and giving aid and comfort to the enemy. It was shortly thereafter that he was taken into custody under the emergency regulations then in effect. Soyinka's effort failed East as well as West. 'There is no alternative', he had argued in Enugu: The army must be returned to its status as part of the proletariat. The politician-patrician mentality.. .has begun a new life by its anonymous infiltration of a naive, purely instinctive Army. We need a Third Force which thinks in terms of a common denominator for the people. If the East will pause, ask for a cease-fire and give the Third Force time to proliferate through all the key places... the time is right.1 1 The Man Died, p. I78. 484 ROBERT W. JULY</page><page sequence="9">POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF WOLE SOYINKA 485 His plea was ignored by those Easterners who had already turned their backs on the idea of a Nigerian nation. As for General Gowon, Soyinka's action could scarely have been ignored by any regime intent upon self-preservation and fighting a deadly civil war. He seems to have been carried off on waves of idealism. We must not become preoccupied with national boundaries, Soyinka argued, arbitrary demarcations from a repudiated colonial past. We must not be drawn into a war without purpose, without redeeming social objectives: Militarist entrepreneurs and multiple dictatorships: this is bound to be the legacy of a war which is conducted on the present terms. The vacum in the ethical base - for national boundary is neither an ethical nor an ideological base for any conflict - this vacuum will be filled by a new military ethic - coercion. And the elitist formulation of the army, the entire colonial hangover which is sustained by the lack of national revaluation will itself maintain and promote the class heritage of society. The ramifications of the alliance of a corrupt militarism and a rapacious Mafia in society are endless and are nearly incurable. The war means a consolidation of crime, an acceptance of the scale of values that created the conflict.... ... A war, with its attendant human suffering, must... be made to fragment more than buildings: it must shatter the foundations of thought and re-create. Only in this way does every individual share in the cataclysm and understand the purpose of the sacrifice... there is only one common definition for a people and a nation - a unit of humanity bound together by a common ideology.' There is no denying the intensity of Soyinka's convictions; only the clearness of his vision. Granting the prevalence of power-hungry men and plunderers eager to close in on the public trough, there was more than venality behind the tensions that led to the Nigerian civil war. Peoples of different ethnic, cultural, and linguistic background had been thrust together into an improbable administrative unit called Nigeria only a scant two generations before independence, then set free to rule themselves by means of unfamiliar foreign instruments of government. Mutual suspicions among Regions ran high long before January 1966, and were the basis for the wave of mounting mistrust that followed the military coup. The prevalence of Ibo officers in the army, as well as vast numbers of Ibos living and working in other parts of Nigeria, were constant sources of fear and envy. If superstitious and bigoted mobs were egged on by opportunists, so much the worse, but this was aggravation, not causation. We must look to Nigeria's history to learn about the causes of the civil war. That unhappy conflagration did not.simply begin with the machinations of a few politicians. History also tells much about 1 Ibid. pp. 182-3.</page><page sequence="10">486 ROBERT W. JULY proletarian revolutions. Surely Soyinka would search in vain through its pages for any single instance of a revolution that ever benefited the proletariat. THE WRITER AS POLITICAL PHILOSOPHER Responses to contemporary events was only a lesser part of Soyinka's political philosophy. A broader and deeper view infused his writing, a view of Africa and the world, of the physical and metaphysical, of man and his universe. The cross-over point is most apparent in the novels, The Interpreters and, particularly, Season of Anomy. This latter work is not easy to follow, its story-line subject to abrupt shifts in time and place, but the basic argument is clear enough. Pitted against each other are two antithetic worlds. There is Aiyero, the rural community, an isolated backwater of forests, fields, and tidewater lagoons, and there is the modern African state with its new cities, its burgeoning industry and mechanised agriculture, and its government, of military dictatorship. For the outside world, the village is a curiosity, 'and anachronism [providing] much patronising amusement to the cosmopolitan sentiment of a profit-hungry society... the prime example of unscientific commu- nalism, primitive and embarrassingly sentimental.' For those who dwelt there it was a self-sufficient, successful experiment in communal living, based -upon close and sympathetic proximity to nature, and an egalitarian spirit of shared labour, of mutual respect, and of common traditions, values, and rituals. 'We have observances', one of Aiyero's people remarks, 'We are a farming and fishing community so we acknowledge our debts to earth and to the sea... For a people who own everything in common what we spend merely returns to us.5 Between the two there is no doubt as to where Soyinka's sympathies lie, but it is also apparent which of these worlds will prevail, at least in the short-run. The modern state is prosperous and powerful, its expanding economy based upon cocoa that goes to market with all the lunatic apparatus of western advertising techniques, its government arbitrary and corrupt, but securely guided by politicians and their military supporters. Curfew Town is Soyinka's prototype for the new way: its spotless ultra-modernity.. .a symbol of...progressive and unblemished character... An old, crumbling village, primitive, clannish and locked in decadent rituals of vengeance had been transformed into a clinical exhibition city of factories, colleges and civic contentment. Against all unrest Curfew Town [is] assertively immune. No tendentious propaganda [can] penetrate its geometric bungalows and high-walled state of welfare being.</page><page sequence="11">POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF WOLE SOYINKA 487 Occasional irregularities in public accountability are passed off as the necessary costs of experiment and progress. If such explanations prove insufficient, there is always the army, 'the hundreds of combat-ready soldiers, para-military waggon loads and armoured cars... the darting eyes of plain-clothes security men... their lethal bulging pockets conspicuous....' In this modern state, there are no serious problems with civic disorder, however. As a leading politician announces, 'I know my people - they are cowards!' Kill a few and imprison others, he continues. The rest will toe the line. If not, 'add a zero to the numbers... If that doesn't break them kill a few thousands and take no more prisoners.' In the neighbouring country of Crossriver a similar tyranny exists. Here there are savage massacres of immigrant workers, a clear reference by Soyinka to the slaughter of the Ibo in Northern Nigeria that precipitated the civil war. Soyinka's tale moves on, piling atrocity upon atrocity, the people powerless to stem the tide of their suffering. Nevertheless, in spite of the blood letting, Soyinka warns that the true death they are dying resides elsewhere: The offensive outcrop was only... a mere tip of the iceberg... The real death... was the death from under, the long creeping paralysis of flesh and spirit that seized upon them as the poison tuber might spread through bowels of earth. Those noisy individual deaths were merely incidents. The real extermination went on below. By remaining silent many would survive, but 'in exchange for the surrender we receive a permit to remain alive, but it is really a certificate of death'. Only a few protagonists refuse this type of reprieve, and they survive to be hunted and persecuted. On occasion even they can doubt. Does the bucolic microcosm of Aiyero truly contain the secret of a living harmony? Can it override the 'fortuitous idiocies of the new land spawn, the bureaucrats, the marionettes of power, soldiers and politicians, the technocrats and currency expounders?' Typically Soyinka leaves the issue in doubt, although at the end there are final words of cautious optimism: 'In the forests, life began to stir. ' With Season of Anomy Soyinka has shifted the focus away from the topicality of Kongi's Harvest or The Man Died. Occasional veiled references to contemporary events are only part of a more generalised concern with the nature of society. Here, as in much of his work, Soyinka combines sympathy towards traditional Africa with criticism 1 Wole Soyinka, Season of Anomy (London, 1973), pp. 2, II, I28-30, 134, 137, 175, and 320.</page><page sequence="12">of modernising trends that have been imported from the West. This is not blind-eyed idealism. Rather it reflects a strong belief in tradition, and the continuity of a long-lived culture evolving in new forms with fresh vigour. While still a student in England, Soyinka had already begun to speculate on the role of the writer, particularly the playwright, in searching out the essential idiom in traditional African drama. He saw it as more than writing on African themes, more than use of obvious African imagery; that was mere pastiche. What he sought was an understanding of the esthetics of traditional art, not some frozen anthropological curiosity to amuse a foreign audience, but a living medium, vital to the demands of a modern African theatrical expression. On his return to West Africa in I960, Soyinka busied himself with a study of traditional drama in Ivory Coast, Ghana, and particularly in Nigeria - such indigenous activities as the Yoruba engungun dances, the burial rites of the Kalabari, the spirited folk operas of Yorubaland, or processionals of religious groups like the Cherubims and Seraphims. It was an exciting and fulfilling experience. He speaks of the numerous vital dance troups in the Treichville suburb of Abidjan, the spectacular Gombe dancers in Adjame, the full blooded bawdy play of the Kakakiyu band of Accra, and the Easter passion plays of the Cherubims and Seraphims, 'their [awe-inspiring] procession... to Ikoyi Cemetery at midnight followed by a song and dance vigil for the physical resurrection of Christ'. One thing that impressed him was the great variety of form, another was the similarity of expression that cropped up continuously from place to place - a reminder of the artificiality of West Africa's national boundaries.1 It was no accident that this was also the time during which Soyinka wrote A Dance of the Forests, with its heavy reliance on history, tradition, and a pastoral ambience. And it is not happenstance that this play is generously peopled by gods and spirits to complement its human contingent. As a budding writer, Soyinka hoped to develop a modern African literature, but much of African esthetics was theatrical; hence, the theatre was to be his most appropriate medium. Thus it remains, but for Soyinka there are other, more important, considerations. To begin with, he sees drama as the art form that presents human experience as something shared. Painting, for example, however elo- 1 Soyinka to author, I September 1959 and i6 April I960; J. H. Parry to author, 22 May I959.

JULY</page><page sequence="13">POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF WOLE SOYINKA 489 quent, is experienced individually. Only the theatre, insists Soyinka, offers its art in simultaneity. Participation in understanding sets it apart, and intensifies the 'cathartic processes of the great tragedies'. Beyond this, continues Soyinka, traditional drama in Africa has far transcended entertainment. It is through the drama of ritual that African societies search for harmony in their universe, and for the formulation of social standards and moral verities. More than that, the stage has been imitation of the action, the action of the gods through ritual and epic - ritual that helps man locate himself in a cosmic infinity and epic that signals triumph of the human spirit over those forces that have sought to shackle and destroy. The playwright, Soyinka concludes, must 'control the aesthetic considerations of ritual enactment and give to every performance a multi-level experience of the mystical and the mundane. '1 Drama involving the 'passage-rites of hero-gods' can place heavy demands on the technical resources of the theatre, and probably accounts for some of the obscurities of A Dance of the Forests. Epic and ritual drama also reflect another of Soyinka's basic, long-standing concerns - the need to return to sources, to grasp the world of African metaphysics through myth and literature, and thereby to clarify self-apprehension and understanding of the contemporary African social psyche. Self-apprehension is essential, Soyinka has insisted, for African civilisation can only be intelligible in its own terms by means of its own reference points, not through alien standards created by another civilisation and superimposed from without. 'The man', says Soyinka, 'who... tries to sever my being from its self-apprehension is not merely culturally but politically hostile'.2 African civilisation is, therefore, its own civilisation. In its Yoruba mutation, Soyinka cites a cosmology that differs in important respects from the Greek pantheon with which it has often been compared. The Greek gods show ample evidence of human frailty in their lust, greed, sadism, or cupidity, Soyinka explains, but for these shortcomings they paid no price; it is innocent man who must suffer from the sport of the gods. Under later Christian refinements, he continues, it is the hero's fatal flaw, or the inscrutable unknowable will of God, that contains the stuff of tragedy. For the Yoruba, as Soyinka points out, the character of the gods is of a different order, their functional relationship with man well removed from other cosmologies, and certainly from that of the West. Like the 1 Wole Soyinka, Myth, Literature and the African World (Cambridge, I976), p. 2. 2 Ibid. p. xi.</page><page sequence="14">Greek gods, the Yoruba are anthropomorphic, but they do not dwell in some remote Olympus; more important, they are held accountable for their transgressions, and obliged to make amends through ritual. Thus, as with their human counterparts, their fallibility produces discord, and requires remedial action that will contribute to the constant regeneration of the universe and the restitution of harmony. Finally, the Yoruba gods were not self-sufficient. They needed to come to man in order to be fulfilled, to establish their own totality. And they came, led by Ogun, god of creativity, in an ancient rite of passage. This action by Ogun and his fellow deities is fundamental to the Yoruba world-view. The western mind, says Soyinka, tends to com- partmentalise emotions, phenomena, intuitions, or scientific observa- tions, and these in their diversity and mutual isolation become unrelated in any comprehensive world-view. For the Yoruba, the cosmos is a seamless whole. The gods embody eternity; man is a measure of earthly transcience. Past, present, and future are a continuum containing the ancestors, the living, and the yet unborn, all in contemporaneous existence. There are, however, gulfs that appear beween one reality and another. The descent of the gods, for example, was accompanied by a primordeal chaos that prevented reunion with man. It is through ritual that man seeks to diminish this chasm of divorce from the gods, to recover through expiation his totality of being: Tragedy, in Yoruba traditional drama, is the anguish of this severance, the fragmentation of essence from self. Its music is the stricken cry of man's blind soul as he flounders in the void and crashes through a deep abyss of a-spirituality and cosmic rejection. Tragic music is an echo from that void; the celebrant speaks, sings and dances in authentic archetypal images from within the abyss. All understand and respond, for it is the language of the world.1 There is another way, says Soyinka, in which the striving for harmony is manifest within the African world-view. Man, the community, and nature are concentric circles, and their consonance defines a structure of moral order. A breakdown in any one area must affect the others, and such a consequent disharmony is potentially catastrophic. Take the example of an individual anti-social act, Soyinka suggests. A trans- gression such as adultery or larceny is recognisably undesirable, but may be far less serious than, say, pride or jealousy. Societies dwelling close to nature define their good health in 'the observable processes of natural continuity - ebb and tide, waxing and waning of the moon, rain and drought, planting and harvest - the highest moral order is seen as that which guarantees a parallel continuity of the species.' 1 Ibid. p. I45. 490 ROBERT W. JULY</page><page sequence="15">POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF WOLE SOYINKA 491 In this way the sickness of one man is no isolated phenomenon, and may be seen as a sign of general malady. Again, individual fertility cannot be separated from the regenerative promise of earth and sea. 'Because of the visceral intertwining of each individual with the fate of the entire community, a rupture in his normal functioning not only endangers this shared reality but threatens existence itself.' In this instance it would appear that the Yoruba poet responds to the same image as his western counterpart. No man is an island. While this view of individual and communal harmony is a particu- larity of Yoruba cosmology, it bears close resemblance to the professed world-view of Bantu-speaking peoples as exemplified by the Luba nation of Zaire. Among the Luba there is also the concept of harmony made up through a shared participation in muntu, the life-essence, a harmony that includes both man and nature. The Bantu, however, define life-essence as a finite quantity; hence, individual sickness is seen as a lessening of that individual share, possibly resulting from action by another individual who connives, usually through witchcraft, to add to his own strength. The two world-views are therefore similar, but they differ fundamentally in the important concept of individual relationship to community harmony. The Yoruba appears to be more comple- mentary, the Bantu more competitive.' THE ARTIST AND AFRICAN CIVILISATION Soyinka's concern for Yoruba as a form of African cosmology has more than philosophical or artistic objectives; there are practical consequences for the African. The poet searches out his origins in history and myth, communicates them through his art, and thus establishes identity for himself and his people. In a modern world of many cultures, the African therefore moves with a sense of security, certain of who he is, confident in the viability of his own civilisation. At the time that Soyinka began writing, this self-awareness was crucial because colonialism had ended, and independent African nations were emerging on the world scene, eager to establish themselves, not only politically but psychically as well. The question of identity, however, was an old question, many times asked - during the ages of slavery, during the era of colonial control, and during the centuries that African societies had been buffeted by the aggressive cultural superiority of the West. A hundred years earlier, Edward Blyden and J. Africanus B. Horton had pointed out the 1 Ibid. pp. 5I-3. See R. P. Tempels, Bantu Philosophy (Paris, I959).</page><page sequence="16">essential character of the black man. Many others followed - Alexander Crummell, Booker T. Washington, W. E. B. DuBois, in America; J. E. Casely Hayford, Herbert Macaulay, Blaise Diagne, in Africa. Poets like Aime Cesaire and Leopold Sedar Senghor sang the songs of negritude. Frantz Fanon engaged in his ferocious clash of existential wills, and crushed those who sought to deny him his essential being. Fanon and his followers spoke in violence and anger. Soyinka in word and deed has been by turn farcical, witty, serious, elegant, or obscure; but the action sometimes approaches violence, and there are moments when the anger, tinged with outrage, shows through. The choice of target is not doctrinaire; black and white are censured alike. It is the idea that counts - an idea of racial dignity, of self-awareness, of insisting on the contribution of the African world to a common humanity. This emphasis on an intrinsic viable African civilisation appears in many forms, at its most comprehensive and panoramic in A Dance of the Forests. Despite its obscurities, certain qualities are clearly projected by this sprawling work. It is a drama about modern African society; nevertheless, Soyinka's concern is not so much with modernity as with the past, the idea of cultural continuity, the importance of history, and the close connections of man with nature, and through nature, with his gods. The human characters are an unprepossessing lot, as are many inhabitants of the spirit world, and the historical sections reveal venality and cruelty aplenty. It does not matter that these are often shallow or insensitive people, however. What is important is that here is an old, yet vital, society. It has its character, standards, ethics, morals. Its myths and gods are securely in place; its history, however unsavoury, is assured. Whatever Soyinka may be saying about war, corruption, values, art, or society's need for spiritual strength, he is stating categorically the existence of an African civilisation, long-lived, and promising. This preoccupation with cultural identity shows up as well in Idanre, Soyinka's lengthy poem dealing with the mythology of the Yoruba pantheon. Here again, god and man reveal their imperfections, and both pay the price for their shortcomings. As with A Dance of the Forests, there are numerous subthemes and much symbolism. Nevertheless, the overwhelming impression is one of energy - gods that rise again from defeat to display their supernatural strength, man who is foolish and destructive but also capable of swaying the minds of gods, an iconoclast punished for his blasphemies but surviving and thriving. It is an African world, vivid in imagery, and it is an African culture, its vigour transcending self-destructive tendencies. The mood is optimistic. Sig- 492 ROBERT W. JULY</page><page sequence="17">POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF WOLE SOYINKA 493 nificantly, in the poem's final section, it is of the coming harvest that Soyinka speaks. As a literary critic, Soyinka makes good use of the works of others in pursuit of his perceived African world. His judgements are not necessarily artistic; indeed, his basic standard is awareness of the quality of contemporary African society, his conclusions a refreshing departure from either self-denial or purblind idealism. For example, both William Conton's I960 novel, The African, and Rhythms of Violence, a play by Lewis Nkosi published in I964, submit that the racial barbarism of South African apartheid can be dissolved through Christian charity - the black man in his humanity forgives, turns the other cheek, returns good for evil. Such simplisticjudgements are not for Soyinka, who insists that gratuitous guilt implies a share in the criminal act. It also sanctions that act, reinforcing 'the unrepentent conscience of criminal power'. Soyinka, however, does not allow his argument to draw him into the dead end of revenge, to a biblical, dogmatic self-righteousness. In a surprising and sensitive change of direction, he points out that black and white are of common humanity, that both are culpable in misusing power. As an example, he offers the first generation of Africa's post-independence leaders, their Olympian mentality and false infal- libility, their 'material and cultural corruption brought... by the incursion of Western ideas, Hollywood trivia and vulgarity'. If the white rulers of South Africa worship 'a deity made in the image of their prejudice' - Soyinka quotes a poem by Denis Brutus - 'the final argu- ment lies simply in the treacherous reality of today's self-governing African nations. Nothing more starkly damning is required than a casual dissection of the reality of power on the continent.' Soyinka's conclusion is inescapable: '"'The deity made in the image of their prejudice" can no longer be identified along the simplistic color line. ' Such strong views are hardly palatable for today's black cultural nationalists, but Soyinka goes a good deal further. Citing Bound to Violence by Yambo Oulouguem, and Two Thousand Seasons by Kwei Armah, Soyinka suggests that the West has by no means been exclusively responsible for the political and cultural brain-washing said to have retarded the authentic history and development of black Africa. Armah, says Soyinka, is uncompromising. The Eurocentric burden of black Africa is totally linked by him with the barbarities of Arab slavers. They too are white men, white slavers like those of Europe. For Armah, each of the two intruders has been guided by a culture in which human depravity is not only natural but essential. Myth, Literature and the African World, pp. 15 and 67-75. '7</page><page sequence="18">494 ROBERT W. JULY Oulouguem puts forth a similar multiple indictment. The European violation of African culture is two-fold, he says - first, the belittlement of black Africa, and then the apparent discovery of African virtues through anthropological study, a discovery that quickly degenerates into entrepreneurial greed, as antiquities are found to be not only culturally but financially profitable. So much for Europe; however, says Soyinka, Oulouguem 'pronounces the Moslem incursion into black Africa to be corrupt, vicious, decadent, elitist and insensitive.' Arab-Islamic culture is shown as imperialistic and hostile towards indigenous civilisation; pious prayer is poised hypocritically against cunning, duplicity, and barbarism. Oulouguem's conclusion is total rejection, but his passionate account takes the argu- ment one depressing step further. Of what value, he asks, is a civilisation that is mocked by Europe's mercantilism and Islam's barbarism? Is not the contempt of the torturers for the victims justified? Where is the authentic nobility of Negro art? 'The tapestry of repudiation comes alive before our eyes', says Soyinka. 'The Bible, the Koran, the historic solemnity of the griot are reduced to the histrionics of wanton boys masquerading as humans.' Here are echoes of A Dance of the Forests in which the ancient kingdom of Mata Kharibu is shown to be a powerful but brutal and corrupt tyranny, where senseless war is countenanced and courageous honesty is rewarded by emasculation and enslavement.1 Soyinka does not follow Oulouguem to the gloomy conclusion that all societies are bankrupt, the African along with the European and the Islamic. Instead, Soyinka stresses the unique and complementary character of each world civilisation, much as Edward Blyden viewed the races of mankind as equal contributors to God's universality, much as Senghor later defined his concept, 'civilisation of the universal'. Indeed, Soyinka's image of African civilisation does not differ markedly from what others, including Blyden and Senghor, have described. In his time, Blyden stressed the African's sense of community solidarity, his closeness to nature and the Godhead. Senghor's negritude has also emphasised religious sensitivity and sympathy with nature, while his 'civilisation of the universal' hypothesises a uniquely African culture to complement that of the West. Such ideas appear comfortable in the context of Soyinka's writing. Certainly his preoccupation with the gods, and with the continuity of life's existence from the ancestors through the living to the yet unborn, give strong support to traditional values. Soyinka's picture of village life and the old ways is not uncritical, but is it usually sketched with 1 Ibid. pp. 98-107. See A Dance of the Forests (London, 1963), pp. 53-65.</page><page sequence="19">POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF WOLE SOYINKA 495 sympathetic humour. New ideas imported from abroad may receive rougher treatment, however, as in the pastoral comedy, The Lion and the Jewel. In this play, Soyinka gives substance and wisdom to the village chief and the young girl he eventually takes in a polygamous marriage; the fool is the modernising schoolmaster who yearns for concrete highways, metal saucepans and automobiles, beauty contests, ballroom dancing and cocktail parties. As for the village head: I do not hate progress, only its nature which makes all roofs and faces look the same... Among the bridges and the murderous roads... in these years to come, we must leave virgin plots of lives, rich decay and the tang of vapour rising from forgotton heaps of compost lying undisturbed.' This is no inflexible rejection of the contemporary world, of the life-saving advances of modern medicine, for example, or the numerous technological and artistic prodigies that have enriched today's societies. For Soyinka the cosmology of Africa is not stagnant. It evolves, in its wisdom shuffling off the decadent and obsolete, and absorbing what is new and useful. Thus Sango extends his power over lightning to the control of electricity. Ogun, the god of war, becomes also the god of revolution, while his creative character enables him to provide the cables and pylons that carry Sango's magical currents across the high hills and broad red valleys:2 ... in the elemental fusion, seed To current, shone the godhead essence; One speeds his captive bolts on filaments spun of another's forge...3 No doubt Soyinka would not wish to be identified with Senghor, since his dispute with negritude is of long standing. Less understood are Soyinka's reasons, however. On the face of it, his convictions over the importance of an idiomatic African presence in the world do not differ in any fundamental sense from Senghor's own philosophy or netgritude. Put simply, each seeks to restore the character of a race and to celebrate its qualities. Where then the quarrel? It is not so much objective, says Soyinka, as method, not such much method as its premise. Negritude sets out to establish a system of black values. To achieve this, Soyinka continues, 1 For these ideas of Blyden and Senghor, see Robert W. July, The Origins of Modern African Thought (London, I968), chs. i and 22; Soyinka, Myth, Literature and the African World, p. xii; and The Lion and the jewel in Collected Plays, 2, p. 47. 2 Myth, Literature and the African World, pp. 53-4. 3 Wole Soyinka, Idanre and Other Poems (London, 1967), p. 64. 17-2</page><page sequence="20">it searches for reference points, not in Africa but - incredibly - in the West. Ignoring the metaphysical unity and continuity of African psychic existence, ne'gritude adopts the duality of a European dialectical argument and accepts a western racist premise. The resultant syllogism, Soyinka argues, establishes the European as an analytical thinker, the African as a man of intuitive understanding. Sine analytic thought is the mark of advanced development, European civilisation is pronounced highly developed. The secondary conclusion, Soyinka continues, should then be that the African is not highly developed; hence slavery and colonialism. But no. The racist slur that the African is by implication not capable of analytical thought, and therefore not highly developed - this is avoided. ]Negritude posits intuitive understanding also as a mark of development. The African is saved. He too may be considered as advanced. Such sophistry is too much for Soyinka. The primacy and European monopoly of analytical thought is never examined, he insists; neither is the character of intellectual processes in Africa. What outrages Soyinka in particular, however, is the unquestioning acceptance of these Eurocentric axioms by the proponents of negritude. The end result may be an affirmation of African civilisation, yet it comes not by its own logic but by sufferance, not on innate but borrowed terms. Of course, Soyinka admits, there have been genuine creations of artistic or philosophic merit within the negritude movement, but these have survived primarily through the strength of their own internal conviction. Take the case, says Soyinka, of the historian of African culture, Cheikh Anta Diop, who challenges the imposition by outsiders of an African history that dismisses African achievement, and violates all indigenous cultural and ethnic sensibilities. On examination, Diop finds that this history is a deliberate falsification, with the true evidence suppressed and the interpretations skewed. Reviewing the evidence, Diop concludes by questioning the origins of European civilisation itself. The argument is turned on its head. Africa no longer need look to Europe for the latter-day progress of modernisation. Indeed, it is Europe that must look to Africa, says Diop. The origins of modern European culture lie with the Greeks, but they were copiers, not creators; their art, their science, their philosophy borrowed from Egypt, that ancient centre for the conception and diffusion of black African culture. It is easy to sympathise with Soyinka's impatience over the negritude movement. Its supports genuflect to the north, even at the moment of their most fervent devotions to Africa. Soyinka senses the reason; the movement has been taken over by European intellectual interests. They 496 ROBERT W. JULY</page><page sequence="21">POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF WOLE SOYINKA 497 cannot leave a good thing alone. NJegritude is commandeered, its basic objectives perverted as it is made to subserve a foreign objective, in this case the proletarian struggle. But is this truly the basis for negritude's northern bias? Has Soyinka, in fact, penetrated far enough in his analysis? A more plausible hypothesis suggests that negritude is at bottom a European idea, with its roots in existentialism, Marxism, and surrealism. The idealised image of an unspoiled humanity in its apparently primitive purity had much attraction for those Europeans shattered by the slaughter of World War I and disillusioned with the shortcomings of industrial society. For them the true pulse of life lay elsewhere, in the drums of Africa, so vibrant with the essential qualities of human existence. Such vision permeating the intellectual currents of inter-war Europe were also attractive to black men living in the West, particularly those in France, where an existentialist perception of a better world combined with Gallic affirmation for the beauties of French culture. The practi- tioners of negritude were black men from Africa and the Americas, but many were more at home in Paris than in Dakar, more French than the Frenchman himself. If there must be blame, it belongs not to negritude but to the attractions and successes of French assimilation.1 THE ARTIST, AFRICA, AND EUROPE The dispute over negritude is symptomatic. Whatever the issue and whoever the proponent, the African artist invariably discusses his own culture and history while looking over his shoulder, one eye on Europe. Cheikh Anta Diop seeks to demolish Eurocentric history and establish African cultural primacy, but he succeeds only in supporting the validity of European culture by insisting that it has an African origin. Soyinka brings his formidable talents to bear in reconstructing an African cosmology and producing an authentically African literature, but much of this effort is defensive - disclaiming western values, and those Africans who support them, seems to concern him as much as the positive exposition of the many things that Africa has to offer. Does Cheikh Anta Diop understand where his research has taken him? Given his objective of securing the primacy of African civilisation, would he not be better off to condemn western culture while firmly disclaiming any African connection? When Soyinka attacks negritude, he isjustifiably irritated by the proposition that Europeans and Africans do not think alike, but can he have it both ways? Can Soyinka claim 1 Myth, Literature and the African World, pp. 107-9 and I26-39.</page><page sequence="22">498 POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF WOLE SOYINKA intellectual sameness without also conceding cultural equality? Is it possible that identical intellectual equipment produces such different world-views? And if so, are cultural differences to be explained only in terms of genetic or racial character? Could Soyinka be guilty of that very human failing, labelling as foreign those attributes that are clearly undesirable while claiming only attractive qualities as one's own? There are numerous reasons why the African artist has been self- consciously aware of the West. These need not be analysed. It is more important that the artist concentrates on his work at hand, giving no thought to the opinions of others, ignoring the rest of the world. Here lies the essense of true freedom. And, in any case, are we not all one? Is it not, as Soyinka himself says, 'A comprehensive world... a common humanity?'.</page></plain_text>
