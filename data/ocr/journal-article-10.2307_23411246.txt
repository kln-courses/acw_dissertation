<plain_text><page sequence="1">"SECOND INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON THE ART OF OCEANIA, WELLINGTON, 1978" "Melanesian Art, A Report on Workshop 5" Chairman and Recorder: Philip J.C. Dark The members! of this workshop were Jill Grant, Marty Zelenietz, Simon Kooijman, Adrian Gerbrands, Dirk Smidt, George Ellis, Roger Neich, Ann Chowning, Juliet Hobbs and Philip Dark. Geoffrey Mosuwadoga was to have been co-chairman but had to withdraw from attending the Symposium. He had proposed that the workshop should give attention to two main problems: the relation between traditional and contemporary Melanesian art, and the anthropological approach and true perception of Melanesian art. Aspects of these two problems were considered but principally in the last of the three sess ions held. The FIRST SESSION was largely given over to two presentations. In the first, George Ellis gave a mainly visual presentation of the "Oceanic Collections of the Museum of Cultural History and Other Californian Holdings," which was followed by a similar one by Simon Kooijman on "Mimika Art." Below is a summary of the subject matter of Ellis' talk completed after the Symposium. "Oceanic Collections in California" by George Ellis "Oceanic art is housed in collections scattered throughout the world. For the museum public, this is fortuitous, since greater numbers of people can view and develop an appreciation and understanding of the cultures and peoples which they represent. For the scholar, the situation is less salutary, since greater amounts</page><page sequence="2">16 of time and money, neither of which is normally available in great quantity, must be spent in locating and working with material relevant to individual research projects. Considerable reserves of material are largely unpublished and, therefore, unknown to all but those who have been fortunate enough to sort their way through the storage areas of hundreds of museums. One step which can be taken to alleviate this problem is the compilation of collection inventories for individual museums. Such listings should include all available primary documentation, if their use is to be maximized. In recent years some cursory listings of museum collections have been made by various agencies. These are useful in localizing collections of inter est, but lack the scope and depth necessary for an accurate determination of schol arly value. California museums house large collections of Oceanic art and ethno graphy. From San Francisco to San Diego, collections of varying quantity and quality are found, some dating to the last quarter of the nineteenth century. A complete annotated compilation of these resources is not available. The following data is presented only as a preliminary effort which will hopefully culminate in a substant ial and exact finished version. Three collections are located in the San Francisco area: The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, M.H. de Young A large portion of the collection entered the museum in 1893, after having been displayed at the San Francisco Midwinter Fair. Approximately 100 pieces, primarily sculpture and masks, derive largely from Papua New Guinea (Trobriand Massim area; New Ireland; Admiralty Is.), the New Hebrides, Fiji, and New Zealand. The Robert H. Lowie Museum of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley Papua New Guinea New Ireland - 20 pieces. New Britain - 40, mostly weapons ยง ornaments. Papuan Gulf area - 250, gope boards, fishing gear, ornaments, feather headgear, pipes, trophy skulls. Massim-Trobriand area - 1200 (collected by Malinowski) weapons, baskets, utensils, adzes, axes, drums, lime spatula, mortar S pestles, canoe prows, fishing gear, kula material clothing, ornaments and lithic material. Sepik River area - 1000, masks and ritual objects, slit drums, pottery, canoe prows, shields, ornaments. Maprik - 200 figures, dance ornaments and architectural elements. Irian Jaya The Highlands - 1,050 pieces including a comprehensive collection of material from the Jalemo. The Asmat - 150 shields, drums, and figures. The Solomons 200 weapons. In addition there are some 400 pieces from the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, and other islands, and a smaller number from Lake Sentani, Geelvink Bay and the Huon Gulf. The Oakland Museum There are approximately 2000-2500 objects from Melanesia, Polynesia, Micronesia, Australia, and Indonesia, one quarter of which was collected in the 1880's and 90's. An exact inventory of these pieces is not currently available. In the Los Angeles area two collections are worthy of note: The Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History The collections are in the process of being reorganized and exact listings for the entire Oceanic collection are not available. Material from Micronesia, Polynesia, and Melanesia is present. There are approximately 1100-1200 pieces from the island of New Guinea. The greatest portion is from the Lower Sepik and has been collected</page><page sequence="3">17 in the past twentyfive years. Of greater importance is a well-documented collection of 406 pieces from the Upper Fly River and Telefomin areas. These were obtained by J. Ward Williams in 1935, while searching for gold bearing deposits. The Museum of Cultural History, UCLA The museum is in the process of reorganizing its collections and there is no exact count, by specific area designation, of its holdings. There are approximately 20,000 pieces from Micronesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia. Of this total the greater proportion is Melanesian and the majority is from the island of New Guinea. Small units of material represent the Asmat and Geelvink Bay areas of Irian Jaya. Papua New Guinea is represented by large holdings from the Sepik and Maprik areas as well as good but smaller collections from the Papuan Gulf, Massim-Trobriand, and High land areas. A complete and well-documented collection of Awa material is the high light of this section. Materials from the Admiralties, New Ireland and New Britain are also present. In addition to these areas of Melanesia, the New Hebrides, the Solomons, New Caledonia, and Fiji are represented in the collection. From Australia there is a fine grouping of objects from the central region. Polynesian holdings are sparse. There are pieces from the Cooks, Australs, and Marquesas, but the largest number are from New Zealand. Perhaps of most interest is a collection of some twentyfive Maori capes, some dating to the first half of the nineteenth century. A portion of the total collection was collected in the 1920's and 1930's. San Diego In San Diego, The Museum of Man houses 2540 pieces from Oceania and another 1200 from the Philippines. While weapons are predominant, a variety of other object types are present. Australia - 245; Solomons - 300; Santa Cruz - 318; New Zealand - 8; New Hebrides - 276; Guam - 172; Polynesia - 534; Papua New Guinea - General 620; Fiji - 32; The Admiralties - 15; New Ireland - 20. The nature of the preceding listing clearly indicates that there is much work to be done before a completely useful inventory is available. These reports are a beginning, but considerable refinement and a consistency of format must be devel oped. In addition, there are no doubt smaller collections which should be included. The listing of items in private hands may be more difficult to achieve, since many collectors prefer to be anonymous. Any assessment of the "quality" of these collections is of course dependent on the particular focus of individual researchers. As one example, a great quantity of material from the Maprik and Sepik areas of New Guinea, produced for the tourist market, has entered California collections in the past fifteen years. These would normally be excluded from studies dealing with "traditional" arts, but would cert ainly be of interest to anyone involved with studies of "changing" arts. Even after the compilation of adequate listings, their use is limited by the costs of photography and travel. If the means are not available for visiting indiv idual collections, photo requests must be made. Charges for these services have risen sharply in recent years, greatly hampering the research efforts of individual scholars, as well as restricting the ability of institutions to develop significant photo archives. In order to deal with this problem, it has been suggested that photo records be transferred to microfiche. By doing so, the cost of obtaining visual images would be drastically reduced, storage difficulties minimized, and the use of collections greatly magnified. In the United States it may be possible to apply for grants from Federal sources which would help to defray the costs of projects to develop listings and microfiche catalogues. Utilization of collections can also be enhanced through active exhibition and publication programs. At the Museum of Cultural History, one aspect of the latter encourages the publication of portions of the collection which are deemed of special scholarly and aesthetic importance. In this instance all examples of objects related to the people, theme, or object type in question are illustrated. By doing so, items of possible interest to other researchers are also made available. .The pro gram offers an outlet for the publication of original research by scholars with special expertise in a given area. Our only stipulation is that pieces from the museum's collection be used as illustrations. Papers and monographs which result</page><page sequence="4">18 may later accompany exhibitions. Museums with facilities for temporary exhibitions should also encourage and implement the showing of works by living artists working in both traditional and international styles. By doing so, artists who have lost their traditional market through changes brought about by the introduction of western concepts and values need not abandon the skills which they possess. Those who are trained and working in non-traditional materials and subject matter can also be encouraged to continue their work with some hope of maintaining a livelihood. The primary functions of museums are to collect objects of scholarly or aes thetic value; to preserve, maintain, and study these objects in the most favorable conditions; and to exhibit them and make them accessible to a broad general audience as well as the scholarly community. At this juncture in the history of Pacific arts as well as of other areas, they should also develop active programs for the exhibi tion of the work of living artists. They can not be limited to a passive, research oriented role but must also, by actively encouraging the utilization and enjoyment of its resources, function as a dynamic educational institution." * * * As a consequence of Ellis' presentation there was concern expressed that efforts be made to select the work of individual Pacific artists for exhibition and sale subsequently, that a subcommittee of the Executive Committee of the PAA look into the possibility of mounting local or travelling exhibits, and a recommendation was made to this effect. This led to the suggestion that an exhibition be put on at the next symposium. Ellis' presentation also led to discussion of the need to help return records of Pacific specimens to their countries of origin even if the specimens themselves can't be returned. Mounting some form of micro-documentation was discussed and attention was drawn to one on Melanesian art which Jean Guiart has established. Simon Kooijman then made a visual presentation on Mimika Art. "No aesthetic research has been done in the area of Irian Jaya inhabited by the Mimika, therefore, there is no way of knowing what position the wood-carvers had in the community nor how they functioned (Kooijman)." Using slides, Kooijman made an analysis of objects in the collections of the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Cambridge University, of the Museum of Mankind, London, the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde, Breda, the Tropen Institute, Amsterdam, and the Museum voor Land-en-Volkenkunde, Rotterdam. It is hoped that Kooijman's full paper with its important documentation of a little known art form will be included in the publication it is hoped to produce of the papers given at the Symposium on Melanesian topics. For the interim, Kooijman has provided a brief summary, which follows. "Mimika Art, A Visual Presentation" by Simon Kooijman The Mimika Papuans live in the southern lowlands of Irian Jaya in an area stretching from Etna Bay in the west to the river Otakwa in the east. Their neigh bours are the Asmat to whom they are culturally related. Mimika art was produced to a large extent for ceremonial purposes and played a part in public celebrations. This function largely determined the nature, size, and style of ornamentation of the characteristic art objects, viz., the bitoro poles, the erect female figures, the jamatรฉ, the ceremonial prow ornaments, the drums, and the masks. The bitoro. Bitoro are the most spectacular art objects of the Mimika. They were made from the trunk and roots of a mangrove-like tree. After the tree had been cut down and the branches removed, all but one of the buttress roots were chopped off, the remaining one being carved with open work to form the projection at the top of the pole. The trunk itself was hollowed out, and in the outer wall one or more human figures - in many cases one above the other - were carved, only the heads being made completely three-dimensional (Fig- 1)ยท Bitoro may be called spirit poles, bi_ being the word for spirit. The human figures represent dead persons and their hollowness is a materialization of the belief that at death the nata or 'inner body' disentangles itself leaving only the kao (rind, casing).</page><page sequence="5">19 The erection of a bitoro was accompanied by homage and the public expression of gratitude to the deceased persons and was also the occasion for taking final leave of their spirits. Thus the bitoro were related to death and the rituals associated with death. On the other hand, however, they also played a part in the boys' nose-piercing ceremony which was an essential part of their initiation. In front of the special houses in which the boys were kept secluded, one or more bitoro were erected. This association with the renewal of life as symbolized by initiation, is expressed on the bitoro in Fig. 1 by the occurrence of an oval-shaped motif in the openwork projection called mopore. The mopore figure is a leitmotiv of Mimika art. Mopore means navel and its application on ceremonial objects has to do with the great importance attached to the maternal umbilicus which is considered 'the essence of life'2. The erect female figures. - The Rijkmuseums voor Volkenkunde in Leiden and Breda have together a total of seven three-dimensional Mimika figures representing pregnant women (Fig- 2). They come from the eastern part of the Mimika region. These figures belonged to the paraphernalia of the house constructed for the celebration of the kiawa feast. An essential element of the rituals of this feast, which is called emakame in other parts of Mimika, refers to the genesis of life from death and the creation of man. In these parts of the ceremonies, as well as in the creation myth for that matter, women play an important role. One of the objectives of the ritual is the promotion of fertility. Thus these representations of pregnant women were associated with the traditional belief regarding creation, fertility, and reproduct ion, and the rituals in which this belief found its expression. The jamatรฉ and the prow ornaments. - Most Mimika collections have a number of board shaped ornamented wooden objects designated in museum catalogues as 'ceremonial shields' or 'ceremonial tablets' and called jamatรฉ by the Mimikans. They vary in height from about 1 metre to about 2 1/2 metres, the average being roughly the height of a man. One of the sides is undecorated, the other bears a relief orna mentation. A number of j amatรฉ show openwork carving or pointed projections on the upper margin, and many of them have a point on the lower edge (Fig. 3). Jamatรฉ played a role in the emakame ceremonies. A row of them was set up in front of the feast-house, the point thrust into the ground and the decorated side facing forward. At first they were covered with mats, and therefore could not be seen by the celebrants. At a certain moment during the feast, a mock quarrel was started to distract attention from the house and the screen of mats. The latter were then suddenly removed exposing the jamatรฉ which evoked loud cries of admiration. Jamatรฉ are also found inside the emakame ceremonial house, hanging on the walls. The jamatรฉ represented villagers who had recently died. In all probability they also symbolized the renewal of life as it was celebrated in the emakame ritual. This association seems to be confirmed by the frequent occurrence of mopore figures - 'the essence of life' - in the relief decoration. Carvings with open work, a number of them resembling j amatรฉ, were attached to the bow of boats on ceremonial occasions (Figs 4 and 5). One of these occasions probably was the boat-feast or kaware feast which, as the counterpart of the emakame ceremonial, was associated with the lower reaches of the rivers and the coast. The drums. - Wooden drums with the head made of iguana skin are indispensable attributes of the dances and celebrations. They are more or less hourglass-shaped. The conical upper part usually shows the characteristic asymmetric relief pattern which covers only about half of the circumference. The handle was made as part of the drum by leaving wood for it when the section of tree-trunk was shaped. In a number of the drums the handle is carved as an anthropomorphic figure, which can vary from a distinctly recognizable human figure to strongly stylized forms that suggest the human body more than they actually represent it (Fig. 6). In its myth ical origin the drum is associated with the kaware feast. The masks. - The masks are composed of a plaited headcover mounted on a rattan hoop resting on the shoulders and carrying a fringed apron and upper-arm covers of plaited rattan. Two kinds of masks were in use which are shown in the Figs 7 and 8. In the mask performances terror, inspired by spirits who were believed to reside in the masks, was an important element. Pouwer gives a description of such</page><page sequence="6">20 a performance which probably was part of the kaware celebration. The leading role was played by a man wearing a mamakoro mask representing a spirit. Besides the evoking of fright and the showing of terror by the participants the celebration also involved the paying of homage to the spirit. His achievements during his life as a hunter and a grower of sugarcane and bananas were related. This part of the celebration was closed by explaining to the spirit that everyone could really get along now without his help. The adult participants, including the women, knew that it was men wearing masks who were involved, but nevertheless, as Pouwer puts it, 'the population sees the whole performance against the background of the invisible but none the less very real presence of the spirits of the dead'3. Body ornaments. - Body ornaments associated with the emakame ritual are the two dimensional bird-shaped objects worn on the head by the men at the end of the feast (Fig. 9), and, as their counterpart, the multi-coloured dancing aprons worn by the women on the same occasion (Figยท 10).

What follows is a summary by Smidt made after the symposium. A remarkable art form found in this area is painting on ฯangal (Melanesian Pidgin for sago palm leafstalk). Such paintings used to be made to decorate interior and exterior parts of the men's houses. It would appear that mythical entities are depicted in these paintings. The presentation centred on the process of manufacture ot a large painting, which, in former times, would have been attached to the gable fronts of the men's houses (Fig. 11). The preparation of the pieces of pangal, the stitching together of these pieces to form a large plane, the preparation of the paints (white, black, red and yellow), the lay-out of the design by means of devices of cane, the use of a piece from an old painting as an example to be copied, the actual painting of the motives, were all illustrated by colour slides. Attention was given to the social processes involved in the making of the painting, for the painting was communally made by a number of men. However, differ ences between the makers, in terms of skill, knowledge, experience and talent, were discernable. A master artist by the name of Simon Novep emerged, who was, in various degrees, assisted by the others (Fig. 12).' The master painted the outlines of the major motives, the others filled in the details (Fig. 13). An exception on this generalization was the sister's son of the master artist, who did an outline of a smaller human figure and who seemed to be destined to follow in his uncle's footsteps. Some tried to make an outline of a minor motif but failed, others merely filled in motives. However, the leader of the whole project was not the master artist but a so called big man, who, after some token participation, withdrew from the actual work, but in the end received the payment for the completed painting. A relaxed atmosphere and the often recurrence of humour were aspects or the situation which deserve mention. Of the completed painting some style characteristics were noted and a detailed iconographical description was given (Fig. 14). The central motif of the painting is a large male mythical figure, named Mopul. Smaller human figures are depicted and a number of animal figures (cassowary, kuskus, lizard, dog) and other symbols (stars, fruits, clubs). The human figures are richly decorated just as human beings decorate themselves for a feast. Featherwork, shell ornaments, pig's tusks ornaments, scarification marks etc. can be discerned. The experiment undertaken by Smidt (the painting was made on his request for the National Museum and Art Gallery of Papua New Guinea) proved that the skills to make paintings on pangal are still present, not only among senior artists but also among a few younger men. However, the incentives to make such paintings in a trad itional context seem to have disappeared.</page><page sequence="8">22 Smidt showed some recent adaptations of the traditional style which had been made. He also showed slides of some pieces which had been commissioned for non indigenously derived contexts, such as wall plaques for the catholic church and the National Museum. Smidt's presentation was followed by discussion of a paper "The Current State of Artifact Production in Kilenge, West New Britain" by Jill Grant. She made a number of points which led to interesting discussion: (1) Virtually no ceremonial artifacts are being produced now; (2) there is a lack of concern among the Kilenge for art and certainly for its preservation; indeed, certain art forms, which used to be required in marriage exchanges are no longer mandatory; (3) that there are very few craftsmen available to meet local needs, that, in consequence, they get overloaded with work but, at the same time, because of the decreasing importance of traditional items^, the artist lacks sponsors for traditional forms of his work; (4) that the artist may be able to change and be innovative, under these conditions. It was commented that perceptions of observers vary and Dark noted that it should be remembered that observers don't see the same things nor do they interact with people in the same way, nor at the same time. Jill Grant noted that the performing arts are still very vital in Kilenge^: Is this so for other similar peoples undergoing similar conditions of change? A general discussion followed, which focussed on changes in art production, and their causes, among the Kilenge. This brought forth the observation by Dark that changes in New Guineรก, for the last hundred years or so, need to be looked at in terms of, say, five year periods, with respect to art production, if it is to be properly comprehended and local fluctuations to be accounted for. The THIRD SESSION started with a concern, expressed by Barry Craig, for a definition of visual art which would permit discussion to focus, as he put it, rather than ramble. Craig expounded on a definition advanced by Donald Brook in "Infant Art and Adult Art. Art Education What Now?" in the Report of the State Art Teachers' Conference, Adelaide, S.A., August, 1974:5-13, and proposed "that we should take the notion of unspecific experimental modelling" as being art. Dis cussion reflected a wish by most to remain flexible but an insistance by others that concreteness would advance our understanding of our subject. Indeed, it was generally agreed that Brook's idea, as represented by Craig, was but one more western model, and too specific. Roger Neich countered that, indeed, we should go into the field with the broadest of models. General discussion developed and the main points made were: (1) that art forms which have diffused can continue and have new meaning, which is sometimes important (Ann Chowning); (2) that, often, there is a great deal going on in a village that has nothing to do with what is going on for the tourist. A people will say that traditional ways have been dispersed, have gone, but, infact, it is not usually so. Kooijman noted, with reference to Fiji, that good tapa makers make good quality tapa for the market but that quite a few non-artists are making poor tapa for the market too. It was observed, (3), that objects which are produced in any quantity do seem to drop off in quality after having been produced for some time. Micronesian plaited materials were mentioned (Dark) as an example of the continuing production of goods of fine quality. The problem of maintaining quality was discussed and exemplified by Adrian Gerbrands, who gave an account of one of FUNDWI's programs run by Jacques Hoogerbrugge in Irian Jaya for the Asmaters to maintain the fine standards of their carving as well as to produce a much needed cash crop.6 The program, one of UNESCO's, under FUNDWI, was launched to try and restore the traditional Asmat art of carving after the hiatus from the changeover from Dutch to Indonesian rule of Irian Jaya. Hoogerbrugge, Gerbrands described, had been a representative of the steamship company operating in the Dutch colonial period, and was himself an artist. He had "a feeling for what kind of objects to look for" among the work of Asmat carvers which was of quality. He was the first Dutchman to go back to Asmat after the Indonesian take over and seek out the work of the carvers. The wowipits took up the idea of carving again to sell their work to Hoogerbrugge so that they would have money to pay their taxes, and the teachers sent to the villages, and buy some trade goods, as, otherwise,</page><page sequence="9">23 they had no means of earning any cash. Hoogerbrugge showed the Asmaters illustra tions in the book of Michael Rockefeller's Journals^7 so as to provide them with a yardstick to quality. He had trouble, however, getting the Asmat wowipits to main tain quality. Gradually, under the UNESCO project, he collected together local work at Agats and set prices for its sale. If the pieces brought to him were not good, he would not buy them. This was a difficult thing for a local man to be able to do. The specimens of quality collected by Hoogerbrugge were shipped to Rotterdam and sold at reasonable prices to museums and selected individuals. The funds were trans ferred back to the Asmat area. Hoogerbrugge's idea was that the artist should profit from the sales. The village whose artists produced most carvings got some money for school books, sports equipment, and the like. Now, however, the Asmaters sell mostly to the tourist ships stopping at Agats. It would seem that the quick deterioration of quality seen on the Lower Sepik has not yet happened in the Asmat. Ann Chowning observed that, while traditionally there may be but a few skilled workers in a community, when steel tools come in new people take up art to meet the tourist's demand while the traditional artists still continue doing good work. Quality, however, does not necessarily drop off, at least locally, as change occurs. Some of the modern Asmat 'inventions' are splendidly skillful and aesthet ically exciting, as Gerbrands and Dark noted in Agats in 1970 or as were to be seen in the fine exhibition of Asmat art held last year in the Rijksmuseum voor Volken kunde Breda.8 The same kind of inventiveness and skill are to be found elsewhere, of course, as was shown, for example, in Kambot art by Dirk Smidt. Not that master artists cannot do poor work too, as Ann Chowning noted for Kovei. At this point the members of the workshop adjourned to Ann Chowning's office which contained a number of examples of modern work from the Trobriand Islands, the Solomon Islands, and other parts of Papua New Guinea, thus providing a stimulus for further observations. In Kovei, Chowning remarked, dolphins are made for the tour ist trade but the money received for them returns to the traditional exchange system. As many as a hundred men in one village are involved in making them. Some fly to Port Moresby with them to sell them. Some discussion followed which was addressed to the problem of the perception of Melanesian art. It would seem unlikely that an outsider would perceive Melanesian art in the same way as would a Melanesian (Chowning). Whether the anthropological approach would provide a satisfactory view or not was open to debate. Indeed, Geoffrey Mosuwadoga's questions for Workshop 5, addressed to the problem of deter mining how Melanesian art is perceived by Melanesians, were open ended, Dirk Smidt explained, as there would seem to be no one way necessarily more satisfactory than another. Further discussion ensued on maintaining control of quality in the production of art and how far this can be done by an outsider. Kooijman pointed out that tourists - at least some - want to have good pieces but that the quality is not available. The question was raised as to whether Hoogerbrugge made a study of Asmat aesthetics in order to establish the controls he imposed. Dirk Smidt said that he had bought everything in Kambot as he did not want to upset a situation he was not familiar with. Only when a person knows the proper criteria should they be imposed. Jill Grant felt that the studies which had been presented were particularistic and, in consequence, it is not clear what is being studied as is the case with other lines of anthropological enquiry. Dark suggested that it was only quite recently that we had begun to compile a sufficient number of studies of arts to begin to work comparatively. Attention was drawn to the dangers of data being removed from their context and thus making study of them impossible. Gerbrands expressed parti cular concern over the observer himself: "how can one control different views of different observers?" - At this point it was agreed that several members of the workshop were talking about one thing and the others about something else, and, it seemed to this recorder, that never the twain shall meet! It was said that this could have applied to Workshop 4: signs of a successful symposium! The Recommendations of Workshop 5 were: (1) Because artists working in urban locales have some access to means of</page><page sequence="10">24 disposal of their work, it is urged that the Executive Committee of the PAA give consideration to exploring ways for local artists to exhibit their work and sell it through galleries and exhibitions, and that outlets for their work be sought beyond the local scene; that such outlets might be sought through the good offices of museums and art galleries in various countries. It is advised that attention be given to full documentation of the artist and his work. (This recommendation para lleled, in part, that of Guiart concerning an exhibition of Maori art in Europe). (2) That at the next Symposium new publications in our subject be displayed. (3) That the Executive Committee of the PAA be urged to seek means of returning visual records of ethnographic specimens to countries which the specimens themselves cannot be returned. It is understood that Jean Guiart has initiated a program for Melanesia. We urge consideration be given also to Micronesia and Polynesia, and to the seeking of funds appropriate to the task. (4) It is understood that local artists have attended this symposium. It is urged that every encouragement be given to their participation in the next one. Captions for Illustrations Fig. 1.

Pouwer, Enkele aspecten van de Mimika cultuur (Nederlands Zuidwest Nieuw Guinea). 's-Gravenhage 1955, p.78. In this book, and in a number of reports published "by the Kantoor voor Bevolkingszaken at Hollandia, Netherlands New Guinea, Pouwer presents results of his research in Mimika during a period of about two years between October of 1951 and May of 1954. The data on the social and ceremonial context of Mimika art derive from his publi cations . 3j. Pouwer, A masquerade in Mimika. Antiquity and Survival 5, 1956, p.385. 4See footnote below. Sin retrospect, this statement prompts the observation that where there are several kinds of performing arts in a culture, and big men have preferences for one or another of them, that a particular performing art can be in vogue for awhile and then lose favour. This would seem to be exemplified at Kilenge in the case of bukumo, a masquerade which had not been performed, at the place Kilenge, since before the second World War till one performance in 1964 and another in 1967. Yet this now seems to be in favour. The production of traditional art forms can wax or wane accordingly but they too - their form, their execution, their decoration - can change at the same time due to economic pressure or greater contact with larger horizons.
