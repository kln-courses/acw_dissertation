Although there is, to say the least, no need now to introduce decon- structive thought into literary studies, one aspiration of the present essay is that an examination of the affinities and contrasts between deconstruction and the work of Agamben- here specifically with regard to translation- will cast new light on this well known body of work as well as contribute to the growing body of critical thought that draws on Agambenian insights into language and literature. 1. Persian and Basque: Variations on a Theme Tommaso Landolfi s "Dialogo dei massimi sistemi," published in 1935, is a story very much about the peculiarities of translation. And fittingly enough, its title is not so easy to translate. In English it has been published as "Dia- logue on the Greater Harmonies" and "Dialogue of the Greater Systems."1 More recently, in texts by writers who also happen both to be fine translators, it is referred to as "Dialogue of the Greatest Systems" and "Dialogue Between the Two Chief World Systems."2 1 myself would probably opt for "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems," accepting the standard transla- tion of the title of the book to which Landolfi s title refers, Galileos Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernicani Landolfi s "Dialogo" is the story of a literarily minded man identified only as "Y" who recounts to his equally literary friend (who in turn is the narrator of the tale) how he had some while ago made the acquaintance of an English sea captain, a man who would animate the talk in a local trattoria with his tales of adventure. Among the many experiences this captain had brought</page><page sequence="3">Kevin Attell • 71 back with him from his exotic travels was an excellent knowledge of Persian, which he offered to teach to Y. Having himself recently devised a theory, not unlike the one Beckett would adopt a few years later, that "having rich and varied means of expression at one s disposal is hardly a favorable situation for an artist" (Landolfi 1986, 249), Y decides to take the captain up on the offer so that he might learn rudimentary Persian and test his hypothesis. The lessons proceed and Y develops his proficiency in Persian to the point where, when the captain must return to Britain, he can continue to refine his skills through the dedicated practical application of the basic grammar and lexicon he has learned from his teacher- that is to say, through composi- tion in Persian. Y makes it a point to note to his friend that throughout this period, his knowledge of the language was attained exclusively by way of the captains lessons and his own practice, and without the consultation of any text in or about the Persian language. And so, when Ys desire to read a certain Persian poet in the original leads him finally to a real Persian text, he is shocked to discover that the language the captain had taught him is not in fact Persian. Indeed, Ys frantic research reveals that it is no known language at all, not Jakuto, not Hainanese, not Hottentot: "Nothing, nothing! Such a language doesn't exist and never existed!" (Landolfi 1986, 251). And to make matters even worse, when Y eventually manages to locate and write to the captain seeking an explanation, the captain claims not to recognize the language he is supposed to have taught Y, evidently leaving Y as its sole speaker on the earth. What, then, are we to make of this language, which nevertheless is "beau- tiful, beautiful" and which Y "love [s] very much" (Landolfi 1986, 252)? And more concretely, he asks, "What about my three poems? Three poems . . . into which I poured the best of myself! What kind of poetry can those three poems of mine be, then? They may as well never have been written than to have been written in a nonexistent language, those three poems!" (252-53). To settle this question Y and the narrator decide to go to the office of a "great critic, one of those men for whom aesthetics holds no secrets and on whose shoulders the spiritual life of an entire nation rests at peace" (253). Since the captain has evidently forgotten this language and since, as we learn, Y has burned his notes regarding its grammar and lexicon, would it</page><page sequence="4">72 • The Muse of Translation not appear that these poems are written in a language that is nonexistent "even for the two people who once spoke it for several months* (Landolfi 1986, 254)? Would this not then make the poems themselves nothing, or at least linguistically and aesthetically insignificant? Not at all, replies the critic, for the quandary is resolved if Y would simply consider the poems as being written in a dead language, , not unlike the languages we know of only through a few indecipherable inscriptions that happen to have survived for us. And "even these languages,' ' he adds, "have a right to our aesthetic respect" (254). At this point the narrator breaks in, objecting that the reality of these lan- guages, unlike Ys "Persian," is not derived from the mere fact of the material inscriptions but rather by the presupposed community of speakers of which these inscriptions bear the trace, "the trace of a structure, of an organization, which places them in time and space and without which they wouldn't be the least bit distinguishable from any other sign on any other rock" (255). The case of Y s poems is entirely different, he points out, for even in the most sparsely attested of written languages, the historical, ethnological, archaeo- logical record of the community that spoke those languages guarantees the linguistic reality of those inscriptions: "an entire people, sir, stands behind an inscriptionr whereas "[b]ehind one of these poems there is only a whim* (256). Indeed, pressing his point, the narrator continues: "in our case the sum of data is so small that one could construct or reconstruct not one, but one hundred, languages. One would thus witness the lovely little example of a poem that could claim to have been written in one language just as easily as in one hundred others which, moreover, are profoundly different from one another and from the first . . ." (255). Faced with this argument, the critic is forced to change tack and proposes another resolution to the quandary presented by Ys literary efforts: "the in- scriptions, that is the poems," he ventures, "can be considered bilingual. Mr. Y, who is now present, can communicate what he wanted to say by translating them" (Landolfi 1986, 256). Thus, since the author is here, he can directly give us the fixed meaning of the text, thereby laying to rest any fear that these marks on the page could mean any number of things in any number of possible languages. But as any translator knows, a text- a poem, no less- is so much more than the literal statement of its sentences. In any translation</page><page sequence="5">Kevin Attell • 73 something is always lost or altered, and as the narrator, having fully warmed to his theme, pointedly notes to the eminent critic, "If you judge my friends poem on the basis of his translation, you will find yourself in the position of the person judging a foreign poet through a translated version of his work. Admit it, it is neither honest nor honorable' (257). And what is perhaps even more damaging to the critic s claim, the narrator suggests, is that even the poet himself cannot fully know what he intended in these productions, hav- ing composed the poems in "Persian" to begin with. His translation would therefore be "no more than a version, comparable to a translation which you or I might do if we had to, and therefore by its nature incomplete and fallacious. It might also be completely arbitrary and have nothing in common with the text; it might be a false interpretation, after all" (257). Placed in check by the narrator s objections, the critic at this point sug- gests that the group finally hear some of the work in question, and Y reads one of his poems: Aga magéra difura naturi gua mesciún Sánit guggérnis soe-wáli trussán garigúr Gúnga bandúra kuttávol jerís-ni gillára. Lávi girréscen suttérer lunabinitúr Guesc ittanóben katír ma ernáuba gudún Vara jeskílla sittáranar gund misagúr, Táher chibíll garanóbeven líxta mahára Gaj musasciôr guen divrés káes jenabinitúr Sòe guadrapútmijen lòeb sierrakár masasciúsc Sámm-jam dovár-jab miguélcia gassúta mihúsc Sciú munu lússut junáscru gurulka varúsc. After listening attentively to this recitation, the critic notes approvingly the repetition of the u sound and the rhymes in use in the last lines, and asks if Y would then care to translate, which he does, "improvising from the text": And her weary face wept with joy As the woman told me of her life</page><page sequence="6">74 • The Muse of Translation And promised her fraternal affection. And the pines and larches of the avenue bent gracefiilly Against a warm-pink sunset in the background And a small villa flying the nations flag, Seemed the wrinkled face of a woman who didn't realize Her nose was shiny. And for a long time after I felt that bright flash, Mocking and bitter, Leap and twist like a playfiil fish Deep in the shadows of my soul. (Landolfi 1986, 258) Even more impressed, the critic exclaims, "Why that s good, really quite good. . . . Now I understand why the u is repeated in the last lines! Bravo, bravo; its an appropriate thing, fortunately, not one bit formulaic." And turning to the narrator he adds, "As you can see, your suspicions were unfounded and hasty. . . . Did you see how quickly he translated?" (259). But it is Y himself who at this point deals the fatal blow to the critics self-assurance, for he sadly informs the group that, no, "that free translation doesn't render the original even remotely. Ihe poem is unrecognizable in translation, it has lost everything; it is devoid of all meaning" (Landolfi 1986, 259). That is to say, in the translation of the poem- and more specifically of the poems "meaning"- into Italian (and here into English) the poem has lost all of its meaning. The imagery, the figuration, and the diction, the bent trees, the sunset, and the flag, are all for naught insofar as they bear not even a "remote" relation to the original, and thus the author s own translation proves, as the narrator had speculated, no better than every other transla- tor s failed efforts. And yet at the same time, as the critic quickly concedes, Y, as the sole speaker of this "Persian," is nevertheless the unique person who would be qualified to judge the aesthetic value of one of these poems. Would he then also concede, Y asks him in quick succession, (1) that something can be a work of art even if the author is the sole person competent to judge it; (2) that poems could be based on sound rather than sense; (3) that a work of art can lack a common meaning, mean something different to each reader, and</page><page sequence="7">Kevin Attell • 75 thus have no meaning; and (4) that poems made of sounds in a nonexistent language can be called works of art? To all of these points, the critic, glancing at the wall clock, summarily yields and rises from his desk to accompany his uninvited guests to the door. The encounter ends with the narrator beginning to ask the critic "But art. . . ." The critic abruptly cuts him off, saying finally: "Art . . . everyone knows what art is. . . ." (Landolfi 1986, 262), a statement whose irony is underlined by the fact that at this point we are no longer quite sure what language is. 000 Landolfi s "Dialogo" was followed a few years later, in 1937, by Antonio Delfini s "The Memory of the Basque Girl" (Il ricordo della Basca , 1963a), which shares with it some striking similarities. As the story opens we meet Giacomo Disvetri- a thinly disguised version of the author himself- languishing alone one August day at a café in " M ***** (surely Delfinis Modena), considering where he might go and what he might do for the remaining days of vacation from his modest job at a local bank. Having already seen his fortieth year and having little or no social or amorous life to speak of, Disvetri has lived, we learn, since his late adolescence in a sort of emotional stasis to which he had become more than resigned. But for reasons that remain undefined, Disvetri has undergone a sort of sudden awakening, or more precisely, "reawaken- ing" (193). Leaving early one evening from his office, "An image had come to him: something like a young girl. He had heard within himself the sound of a voice that was slow and brilliant at the same time, clear, serene, with certain emotional inflections that were impossible to describe" (193). And from this voice the vision of a girl slowly took form, the image of a Basque girl, Isabella de Aranzadi, whom he had seen and fallen instantly in love with at the resort town of Lerici, on the Ligurian coast, one summer 25 years earlier. The story of this meeting and the young Giacomos summer of longing is then narrated in an oneiric tone befitting not only a distant memory but also the dreamy irreality of the original experience itself, an experience that marked the beginning and end of his emotional and amorous life, "his sole and absolute encounter" (Delfini 1963a, 210). "There is nothing so beauti- ful in the world," the narrator of the tale comments, "no time so happy, as</page><page sequence="8">76# The Muse of Translation when you meet someone who has made you cry just to see her" (206); and such indeed is Giacomos reaction upon first seeing Isabella step down out of a carriage with her father in front of their hotel. What follows the strik- ing scene of Isabellas arrival at Lerici, though, is less a story of unrequited love, or even of youthful passion, than of the how this first- and last- love of Giacomo Disvetri oscillates between a meager and unclear "reality" and a far more rich and concrete imagination. For example, Isabellas first actual words to Giacomo are "said in a sweet and soft Italian, with a slightly strange accent as if it might have come only from above. Perhaps she had not even said real words" (201). And in fact little more is said about Giacomos worldly relations with Isabella; indeed there appears to be little more to say. By con- trast, however, in what is perhaps the central event and image of the story, Giacomo waits on the street one rainy evening to catch a glimpse of Isabella at her window. She does come to the pane and seeing him below gestures for him to get home and out of the rain. There, shut up to wait out the storm, Giacomo experiences a sort of epiphanic vision of a life of passionate love, a vision of him and Isabella, under the sun and under the moon, in the cafés and local haunts, naked clothed bejeweled, on horseback or riding bicycles; and on the most blazing evenings of a scorching August, under the smoke of the trains, between a red city and a yellow city, along streams and under the trees, or in the most crowded theaters when they sing "Dear pilgrim, you will never be alone." . . . For the first time there arose in his mind the representation of an embrace: he pressed Isabel to his heart (202-3) And from these images flow even grander and more ominous ones: a voice saying that it is better to leap off a cliff with Isabella, lest they grow older or grow apart and are no longer the luminous creatures of passion that Giacomos reverie has made of them, a challenge that they shrink from and instead "drown themselves in tears and die in that sea that their love had formed" (203). Such is the climax of the young Giacomos fantastic epiphany of love, and it proves indeed to be something of an emotional milestone in his life- a</page><page sequence="9">Kevin Attell • 77 moment of transition that is perhaps the most concrete event of the story. As the narrator tells us, "Thus with the passing of the storm, Giacomo had ended his first representation of love. It had been a revelation for him: he seemed changed, no longer the child of yesterday" (Delfini 1963a, 203). And yet, as summer loves and youthful passions tend to, this relationship that hardly even took place (or, to anticipate terms to be taken up later in this essay, this relationship with an unreal and unattainable beloved) ends with Isabellas return home to Guernica and Giacomos astonished and enduring bereavement at her "eternal disappearance" (206), a bereavement that in turn translates itself into a sort of emotional hermitage lasting for the next 25 years. The tale itself, however, ends with Giacomo and the narrator- in an ambiguous oscillation of voice- both addressing the lost girl, who has in a lyrical flight of imagination become identified with the moon, the sun, and the stars. The narrator concludes the tale in a sort of free indirect discourse, saying, "So I wish to remain in silence, to see you my beloved and graceful star. And if ever a song should suddenly arise in me, sleep soundly: for even if I could not give it voice, my heart would still wish it to be a song, a nocturnal dream for you, a dream that will never end, for I will always be at the window watching you" (Delfini 1963a, 211-12). And as a final cadence we then read these untranslated and uncommented lines: Ene izar maitea ene charmagarria ichilik zure ikhustera yten nitzaitu leihora; koblatzen dudalarik, zande lokharturik: gabazko ametsa bezala ene kantua zaizula. What to make of these verses? In Landolfis "Dialogo" Y provides us with a translation of his Persian poem and even a commentary on its literary qualities, but here, as if Delfini were upping the ante, we can make out little</page><page sequence="10">78 • The Muse of Translation if anything of the poem beyond an evident rhyme scheme. Is it a poem with no sense beyond its sound? To what chief world system might this hapax legomenon belong? Though we might venture a pretty good guess about what language this is (to which we will return toward the end of this essay), suffice to say here that the text gives us no clear indications, not even as to who the speaker (and thus possible translator) of these lines might be, and so as the narrator speaks of waiting forever in silence before the window of the remembered sleeping girl, these verses stand as a final and enigmatic seal on the story, seeming to close it behind an impenetrable cipher like an unreadable inscription. o o o Out of these texts by Landolfi and Delfini, then, there emerges a constella- tion of terms -translation, love , inscription- that marks out the location and obscure contours of a single dark zone of language, a zone that comprises not only the Babelic multiplicity of the historical languages but also, even more obscurely, something that might be called "language" as such. As Ben- jamin proposes in "The Task of the Translator," and as the theoretical texts to which this essay will now turn also argue, what is at stake and at work in the language of translation is not only a set of given languages that must laboriously, perhaps impossibly, be brought into contact with one another, but the single reine Sprache , "pure language," that dwells in that "predestined, hitherto inaccessible realm of reconciliation and fulfillment of languages" (1996b, 257). 2. The "Pure Language" of Translation Agamben, de Man, and Derrida are all translators themselves. Agambens translations include the poems of Juan de la Cruz (1974), A. J. A. Symons s The Quest for Corvo (1969), and (with Ginevra Bompiani) Artauďs version of Matthew Lewis's The Monk (1967).4 Derridas first major publication was the long introduction to his translation of Husserls The Origin of Geometry (1962). And de Man produced, among other translations, an English version of Flauberts Madame Bovary (2005) that is still widely used. In addition to</page><page sequence="11">Kevin Attell • 79 being practicing translators, however, another point that links them (and as I hope to show, separates them) is that not only have they all directed their attention to the philosophical question of translation but they have done so with primary reference to Benjamins essay "The Task of the Translator" (1996b) And more precisely still, they have all three taken up Benjamins evocative and elusive term "pure language" as the central concern of their theorizations of translation. In the remaining pages of this essay, I will take translation and this figure of pure language as the primary signposts in the broader philosophical terrain mapped by these thinkers, showing how their treatments of the question of translation are to be taken metonymically as examples or illustrations of their larger philosophical projects. In his essay "Conclusions: Walter Benjamins 'The Task of the Translator"' (1986a), which was delivered at Cornell University as the last of his series of Messenger Lectures in 1983, de Man makes several illuminating statements concerning his view of Benjamin's concept of reine Sprache , and in doing so provides, as we will see, a specific and suggestive point of contact with Agamben who, in an essay also of 1983 titled "Language and History" (i999d), himself offers an interpretation of Benjamin's concept- one which he not only explicitly distinguishes from a deconstructive interpretation but also proposes as a version of his own view of language.5 Early on in his lecture on Benjamin, de Man asks: "Why, in this text, ... is the translator the exemplary figure? Why is the translator held up in relation to the very general questions about the nature of poetic language which the text asks? The text is a poetics, a theory of poetic language, so why does Benjamin not go to the poets?" (1986a, 80). After quickly acknowledging some possible common-sense answers to this question, such as the fact that Benjamin wrote the essay as a preface to his own translations of Baudelaire, de Man gets to the real starting point of his inquiry: "One of the reasons why he takes the translator rather than the poet is that the translator, per definition, fails. The translator can never do what the original text did. Any translation is always second in relation to the original, and the translator as such is lost from the very beginning" (80). This is not simply a gesture of solidarity on de Man's part for the predica- ment of his fellow translator. The reason for this necessary failure is what</page><page sequence="12">80 • The Muse of Translation makes translation so interesting for Benjamin and for de Man. Translation, of course, is ideally self-effacing; that is, the ideal translation would be one in which the translator is not felt or heard at all, but rather the language of the original (and thus of the author) directly and integrally transposed and re-presented in the new language. The translator him or herself has precisely nothing to say; he or she simply works on the text, seeking to carry it over into the new language. And this, of course, is a task in which one can never completely succeed, for the totality of the original text can never be wholly transported: something is inevitably lost, fractures occur, imperfect analo- gies or approximations must be employed, not entirely satisfying choices must be made- and the more "poetic" the text, the greater these difficulties become. Such are the sorrows of the translator, whose job is not an easy one. But none of these difficulties- and this is the crucial point- has anything to do with the translator s own poetic statement, with what the translator wants to say, because, again, the translator has nothing to say. Instead, the translator starts with the text, with the expression, already in hand, and his or her difficulties arise from the nonidentity and incommensurability of the various historical languages, which prevent a perfect transposition of the original text into a different language. As de Man (following Carol Jacobs) notes, the Aufgabe of the translator is both the task of the translator and the translator s necessary giving up in the face of this task (1986a, 80).6 For Benjamin, however, and for de Man, this task which is a giving up is what translation paradoxically has over poetic composition. This necessary and foregone failure is, in fact, from the point of view of the philosophy of lan- guage, translations extraordinary success; it is why translation approaches language from a wiser, less mystified point of view. For it is precisely in this impossibility that the translator comes face to face with an essentially expropriated and abstracted element of language, one that fatally disrupts any view of language as being fundamentally a vehicle for expression and communication. To this effect, de Man writes that the "naiveté of the poet [is] that he has something to say, that he has to convey a meaning which does not necessarily relate to language. [By contrast, t]he relationship of the translator to the original is the relationship between language and language, wherein the problem of meaning or the desire to say something, the need to</page><page sequence="13">Kevin Attell • 81 make a Statement, is entirely absent" (1986a, 81-82). For de Man the task of the translator is a crystalline image of an immanently linguistic operation conducted on a "purely technical linguistic language" (97); it is, as he says in the essay "Reading and History," "by definition, intralinguistic, not a relation- ship between a subject and an object, or a foreground and a background, but between one linguistic function and another" (1986c, 61). Unlike the poet, the translator has no illusions of any personal, extralinguistic "referent" to the statement of translation, and thus he or she operates on the pieces of language- arranging, rearranging, recombining them- without regard to his or her own self and the verbal expression of internal thoughts, emotions, contents, and so forth. As a description of the task of the translator, de Mans account up to this point perhaps remains close to the realm of common sense. But in fact, as noted above, de Man observes that what is at stake in Benjamins essay is not simply a theory of translation per se, but a "poetics." The essay presents itself as a theory of poetic language, and so the analysis of the language of trans- lation must have some bearing on the claims made about the language of poetic composition, which, again, has always been thought to be the primary and privileged of the two. And indeed, de Man highlights the way in which there is a revelatory reversal of this hierarchy of primary verbal expression and secondary technical manipulation. As suggested by de Man s description of the poets "naiveté" in the passage quoted a moment ago, this externality and expropriatedness of the language of translation proves also to be the case with even the so-called "original" poetic statement. On de Mans reading, it is the paradoxical philosophical achievement of translation not only to be a nonexpressive and nonoriginal event or procedure of language, but also to reveal this nonoriginality operating in the original text itself. For as de Man writes in a famous passage, translations, being purely intralinguistic, relate to what in the original belongs to language, and not to meaning as an extralinguistic correlate susceptible of paraphrase and imitation. They disarticulate, they undo the original, they reveal that the original was always already disarticulated They kill the originili, by discovering that the origi- nal was already dead. They read the original from the perspective of a pure</page><page sequence="14">82 • The Muse of Translation language ( reine Sprache ), a language that would be entirely freed of the illu- sion of meaning- pure form if you want; and in doing so they bring to light a dismembrance, a de-canonization which was already there in the original from the beginning. (1986a, 84) In this passage de Man offers his first gloss on Benjamins concept of "pure language," which appears here to be more or less synonymous with "pure form." But what does de Man mean by "pure form"? One obvious possibility would be the grammatical, lexical, and syntactical structures that we can associate with the isolated signifier or word (in its literal materiality), which de Manian rhetorical reading has shown to be incommensurable with any hermeneutic or semantic claims made on the basis of an intended meaning to be communicated, this latter according with the view that Benjamin in the essay "On Language as Such and on the Language of Men" disparagingly refers to as the "bourgeois conception of language" (1996a, 65)- language as communication of intended meanings. Indeed, it is in response to such a "humanist" view of language that de Man is led provocatively to describe this external and expropriated state of language- pure language- precisely in terms of the "inhuman." In response to a question from Neil Hertz concerning his use of the concept "inhuman" in the lecture, de Man states: lhe "inhuman," ... is not some kind of mystery, or some kind of secret; the inhuman is: linguistic structures, the play of linguistic tensions, linguistic events that occur, possibilities that are inherent in language- independently of any intent or drive or any wish or any desire we might have. . . . [F]rom the statement that language is not human, that history is not human, which is made at the beginning [of Benjamins essay], we are now brought to see something about the human that goes beyond that in that sense . . . whether it is mysterious, whether that is inhuman, or whether that is . . . the sacred, or something, one is impelled to read reine Sprache as that which is the most sacred, which is the most divine, when in fact in Benjamin it means a lan- guage completely devoid of any kind of meaning function, language which would be pure signifier, which would be completely devoid of any semantic</page><page sequence="15">Kevin Attell • 83 function whatsoever, a purely technical linguistic language- and it would be limited to its own linguistic characteristics. (1986a, 96-97) A close reading shows that in this passage there is an intimate connection, but not identification, between the inhuman and pure language. On the one hand, the inhuman is actually defined in four different ways: as structures, play, events, and possibilities, none of which (including "structures") can quite be pinned down as a material thing- very much like the adjectival noun "the inhuman" itself. On the other hand, pure language, "pure signifier," "a purely technical linguistic language," appears to have a sort of substance or "thingness" to it; it is the pure (arbitrary) signifier devoid of or detached from any semantic function and considered only in terms of its "linguistic characteristics," which would in turn be the cause of its effects, functions, and relations within the noncommunicative sphere of the inhuman. With this distinction between the immaterial inhuman and material pure language in mind, one should note that de Man s definition of pure language seems to undergo a slight shift or further elaboration over the course of the lecture, until it ultimately appears to be less the material and literal elements (pure signifiers) of syntactical and grammatical structures than itself the immaterial and disarticulating "movement of the original" that translation, as we have seen, brings to light. "This movement of the original," de Man elaborates, is a wandering, an errance , a kind of permanent exile if you wish, but it is not really an exile, for there is no homeland, nothing from which one has been exiled. Least of all is there something like a reine Sprache, a pure language, which does not exist except as a permanent disjunction which inhabits all lan- guages as such, including and especially the language one calls ones own. (1986a, 92, last italics mine) This description- or quasi-description- of pure language is slightly but significantly different from the one discussed a moment ago. For here it is less the pure (arbitrary) signifier than the errance and movement that arises when semantics or hermeneutics collide with grammar and stylistics in the</page><page sequence="16">84# The Muse of Translation event of reading (or its synonym here, translating).7 Pure language is not a material thing at all but an unstoppable motion and errance that inheres in language. Two definitions of pure language, then, and it is not always easy to tell which sense de Man has in mind in this piece, whether it is a solid materiality of linguistic elements (say, pure signifiers) or a paradoxically immaterial dis- juncture, errance, or movement that inheres in language. If one is uncertain here, however, it is perhaps not entirely due to ones own errant reading of de Mans text, for the mutability of terminology in de Mans work has been identified as one of its characteristic features and described as one of the sources of its difficulty and power. For example, Jonathan Culler, following an observation by William Ray, has noted how often terms and categories to which one gives weight [in de Mans texts] prove to have been used elsewhere with a contrary valorization or in a quite differ- ent sense which nevertheless seems systematic rather than accidental. One might say that apodictic statements which prove not precisely compatible take the place, in de Mans writings, of Derridas neologisms, his nonconcepts, and his typographical structures or devices. De Mans play consists of the slippage of terms in weighty assertions that resist reconciliation. (1985 ,102)® In the case of de Mans use of "pure language," then, we have what appears to be a prime example of two not precisely compatible statements concerning the weightiest term in the essay, both of which, as we will see in a moment, get invoked and collapsed in de Mans description of the "materiality of the letter." In de Mans interpretation of Benjamins essay, then, the rigorous task of translation constitutes a sort of extremely close reading that, in its consti- tutive inability to transpose the integral totality of the original statement, reveals that the original is itself not a seamless, coherent, meaningful whole but rather a problematic assemblage of articulated parts. Under the scrutiny of translation, which must arduously disassemble and then reassemble the syntax, lexicon, and grammar of the original text, the language of the original is shown to consist not at all of statements or sentences (Benjamins Satz' but</page><page sequence="17">Kevin Attell • 85 of words (Benjamins Wort), words that as "pure signifiers" not only lack any meaning in their singularity but also, in their imperfect articulations and figurai slipperiness, introduce an unstoppable movement into the text of the original. Are grammar (Wort) and meaning (Satz) compatible? Do they sup- port one another? Do they ever even meet? De Man argues that Benjamins analysis of translation casts grave doubts on any claim that they do, and this is the reason why (as we also saw in Landolfi s "Dialogo"), "from the mo- ment that a translation is really literal, wortlich , word by word, the meaning completely disappears" (1986a, 88). One more illustration before turning to a different text. To tighten the focus on this last point concerning the disjunction between Wort and Satz , de Man reduces even further the atomic elements of language from words (lexical units) down to letters. He writes: lhe problem [of Wort and Satz] is best compared to the relationship between the letter and the word; the relationship between word and sentence is like the relationship between letter and word, namely, the letter is without mean- ing in relation to the word, it is a-semost it is without meaning. When you spell a word you say a certain number of meaningless letters, which then come together in a word, but in each of the letters the word is not present. The two are absolutely independent of each other. What is being named here as the disjunction between grammar and meaning, Wort and Satz , is the materiality of the letter, the independence, or the way in which the letter can disrupt the ostensibly stable meaning of a sentence and introduce in it a slippage by means of which that meaning disappears, evanesces, and by means of which all control over that meaning is lost. (1986a, 88-89) If it is true that there are two (however subtly) distinct senses of "pure lan- guage" at work in de Mans essay, both are invoked and collapsed in this definition- or perhaps more precisely, denomination- of "what is being named here" as "the materiality of the letter."9 With a certain parallel to the definition of "the inhuman" discussed above, it initially appears that, on the one hand, the a-semos letter is some sort of thing, a meaningless thing that is nevertheless the building block of the meaningful word (in the earlier</page><page sequence="18">86 • The Muse of Translation formulation, meaningless words were articulated together into meaning- ful statements, while here meaningless letters are now articulated into meaningful words), and the two spheres are absolutely independent of each other. But on the other hand the materiality of the letter is not a physical property inherent in and confined to the letter; rather the system of mutual independence or disjuncture between the word and the letter is itself named as the letter s materiality. Amazingly paradoxical statement: the materiality of the letter is not the materiality of the letter, but the disjuncture between the letter and the word. In truth, the claim is less paradoxical than it may seem, or if it is not less paradoxical, its paradox can at least be understood by situating it within de Mans larger oeuvre, especially the work from Allegories of Reading to the later essays- the period in which, precisely, de Man turns his attention to thinking this materiality which, in Derridas words, is a "materiality without matter." Derrida provides an incisive description of de Man s "materiality." He writes: The materiality in question- and one must gauge the importance of this irony or paradox- is not a thing; it is not something (sensible or intelligible); it is not even the matter of a body. As it is not something, as it is nothing and yet it works, cela oeuvre, this nothing therefore operates, it forces, but as a force of resistance. It resists both beautiful form and matter as substan- tial and organic totality. This is one of the reasons that de Man never says, it seems to me, matter, but materiality. Assuming the risk of this formula, although de Man does not do so himself, I would say that it is a materiality without matter. (2001, 350) In many of the texts that now make up the volumes The Resistance to Theory and Aesthetic Ideology, the object (or upshot) of de Mans readings is indeed named as "materiality" rather than matter.10 And we have already seen a representative example of how this terminological precision (or equivoca- tion) is deployed in the Benjamin essay, where the "materiality of the letter" is, like the "inhuman," never actually defined as a solid material thing, and is instead an "independence" and a "way in which the letter can disrupt the ostensibly stable meaning of a sentence and introduce in it a slippage." As</page><page sequence="19">Kevin Attell • 87 an "independence" and a "way," materiality is not a solid substance at all but, if anything, an effect or a condition of language, an effect or condition revealed- or produced- by what de Man calls "reading" (or, again, in the Benjamin essay, its synonym, "translating"). But what kind of effect or condition? If this account of de Mans presenta- tion of pure language- and the materiality of the letter- in the Benjamin essay is correct, then it accords with the way Derrida describes the meaning and function of "materiality" in de Mans late work. The passage from Derrida just cited, for example, seems clearly to illuminate the endoskeleton of de Mans Benjamin essay, as does this passage a few lines before it: "[T]he literal- ity of the letter [defines] here the place of what de Man will call materiality. The literality of the letter situates in fact this materiality not so much because it would be a physical or sensible (aesthetic) substance, or even matter, but because it is the place of prosaic resistance ... to any organic and aesthetic totalization, to any aesthetic form" (Derrida 2001, 350). Materiality, then, is that in language which resists organic and aesthetic totalization. As such it assumes an unparalleled importance in the late de Mans critique of what he calls "aesthetic ideology." For de Man, the only logic that has ever held out the promise of uniting the spheres of representation and presence is the aesthetic, and much of de Mans effort of this period is devoted to showing how the "aesthetic" is precisely an ideology put to this specific use by, among others, philosophers attempting to think through the aporetic impasse of semantic and semiotic.11 The aesthetic, however, always ultimately fails for de Man, and showing how it fails is the program of these essays- and where it breaks down, the rocks on which it runs aground, is what de Man calls "materiality." As I intend to show in a moment, Agambens reading of Benjamins pure language in his essay "Language and History" is, in large part, a polemic with deconstruction, though of course not with de Mans lecture on "The Task of the Translator," which was delivered the same year that Agamben s essay was published. It is, however, written a few years after Derridas own discussion of "The Task of the Translator" in "Des Tours de Babel." De Man alludes to this piece, or more precisely, to the seminars on which it was based, in his own lecture (see 1986a, 80), and Agambens analysis of the Benjamin essay also</page><page sequence="20">88 • The Muse of Translation appears to respond to this essay, which Gil Anidjar identifies in his editor s note on "Des Tours de Babel" as Derridas "first, and perhaps most explicit, extended discussion of the name of God" (Anidjar 2002, 102). In "Des Tours de Babel" Derrida, like de Man, argues that "[i]f [in Benja- mins essay] the original calls for a complement, it is because at the origin it was not there without fault, full, complete, total, identical to itself" (2002, 121). It is, of course, not surprising to find de Man and Derrida both arriv- ing at this interpretation of Benjamins essay, and indeed their readings do converge on a similar point (or vanishing point) located at the non-nexus of meaning and letter (a space or gap identified by both as pure language). And for both, translation, or the translatability of the historical languages into one another, is the privileged (possibly only) linguistic operation that brings this pure language to light. Derrida writes: [W]hat [languages] are aiming at intentionally, individually, and jointly, in translation is the language itself as a Babelian event, a language that is not the universal language in the Leibnizian sense, a language which is not the natural language that each remains on its own either; it is the being- language of the language, tongue or language as such, that unity without any self-identity, which makes for the fact that there are languages and that they are languages. (2002, 131) A translation never achieves an identity with its translated; rather trans- lations and "originals" accord with one another, producing an irreducibly polyphonic harmony that Derrida calls "the accord of tongues" (131), whose differential relation to one another constitutes languages centerless and originless system of signs. It is the accord of (un)translatability among the historical post-Babelian languages itself- the fact that they can, must, and always fail to be translated into one another- that alone is the index, though not the presentation, of the pure language of the Babelian event, the being-language of languages, language as such, what language "is." Derrida continues, "This accord lets the pure language, and the being-language of the language resonate, announcing rather than presenting it. As long as this accord does not take place, the pure language remains hidden, concealed</page><page sequence="21">Kevin Attell • 89 ( verborgen ), immured in the nocturnal intimacy of the core.' Only a transla- tion can make it emerge" (131). "Des Tours de Babel" is an essay on translation, and on Benjamins essay on translation, but it is also an essay on the name of God, an issue that, for all the affinities between Derridas and de Mans analyses, is largely ab- sent (or downplayed) in de Mans reading. Indeed, the "Babelian event" to which Derrida refers in the passage above is nothing less than the name of God, spoken by God to disrupt and disseminate the unicity of pre-Babelian human language. Citing Genesis 11:8-9 (in translation), Derrida writes that in retribution for their boldness and in fear of what they might achieve with a single tongue, God, disseminates the Sem, and dissemination is here deconstruction: YHWH disperses them from here over the face of the earth. They cease to build the city. Over which he proclaims his name: Bavel, confusion, for there, YHWH confounds the lip of all the earth, and from there YHWH disperses them over the face of the earth. Can we not, then, speak of God's jealousy? Out of resentment against that unique name and lip of men, he imposes his name, his name of father; and with this violent imposition he opens the deconstruction of the tower, as of the universal language He at the same time imposes and forbids transla- tion. (2002, 107-8) In Genesis, of course, there are actually two origins of human language. With this second origin of language, the origin of the historical languages as distinct from the Edenic nomenclature of Adam, the linguistic operation that most closely approaches the being-language of language is translation. And translations necessity and failure is, for Derrida, the correlate to the fact that there is no being-language of language, or rather, no being of lan- guage that extends beyond or before the play of the historical languages or of language's "literal" signifiers- ultimately its letters. The origin of language is the unbuilding of the tower of Babel, which is at the same time the origin</page><page sequence="22">90 • The Muse of Translation of translation. There is nowhere for language to go (pas de sens) outside of itself, and there is no sense to be found beyond or before the system of signs: What comes to pass in the sacred text is the occurrence of a pas de sens. . . . Pas de sens- that does not signify poverty of meaning but no meaning that would be itself, meaning, beyond any "literality." . . . [The sacred text] is the absolute text because in its event it communicates nothing, it says nothing that would make sense beyond the event itself. ... It is literally the literality of its tongue, "pure language." And since no meaning bears detaching, transfer- ring, transporting, or translating into another tongue as such (as meaning), it commands right away the translation that it seems to refuse. It is transferable and untranslatable. There is only letter and it is the truth of pure language, the truth as pure language. (2002, 133) Derridas reading, then, revolves around the figure of the name of God in Ben- jamins essay, and pure language is identified or named here as the errance and noncoincidence (the simultaneous translatability and untranslatability) among the historical languages imposed by Gods originary dissemination of the Sem.12 The absence of meaning outside of the combinatory play of the signifiers of the various languages is not only the continuous repetition and reverberation of the violent originary confusion of tongues, the endless enactment of the historical languages "pure transferability" (2002, 132), but also the ceaseless differential movement and pure language that, in the act of translation, is shown to be the very possibility of there being languages at all. 000 Pure language and the name of God, then; these are, unsurprisingly, also precisely the coordinates of Agambens reading of Benjamins text, and thus the foregoing should serve to illuminate the stakes involved when at a crucial point in the essay "Language and History" Agamben explicitly states that Benjamins "pure language" is precisely not the language envisioned by gram- matology and deconstruction. But what exactly does he mean by this? The answer has everything to do with the status of the letter and writing. In "Language and History" Agamben summarizes and dismisses three</page><page sequence="23">Kevin Attell • 91 possible interpretations of Benjamins reine Sprache: (i) as a sort of Espe- ranto, (2) as the infinitely interpretable language envisioned by Gadame- rian hermeneutics, and (3) as the sacred language of Cabalistic theory, as articulated by Gershom Scholem, wherein the mystical, negative foundation of every human and historical language is the unutterable and meaningless ( a-semos ) name of God. Of these three interpretations, it is, of course, the third that interests us here. For the divine and unutterable name of God is, according to Scholem, simply and irreducibly the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, which provide the infinitely recombinable marks out of which lan- guages-written languages- are built. The name of God is the only "literal" word, strictly speaking, because it consists simply of material letters without constituting any particular semantic expression. Scholems interpretation indeed appears, as Agamben notes, to be a rather plausible gloss on Benjamins concept (one that corresponds very closely to de Mans and Derridas), and yet, Agamben argues that we must reject it. In a key passage, in which the specific polemic with deconstruction is elaborated, he writes: With this mystical conception of the relationship between the "literal" name of God and human language, we enter into a horizon of thought that was cer- tainly familiar to Benjamin and that has been secularized in our time through the theory of the supremacy of the letter or gramma (as the originary negative foundation of language), which, starting with Derrida, appears in innumer- able forms in contemporary French thought. Yet, once again, Benjamins text excludes the possibility of such an interpretation. While the mystical and in- significant character of the name of God is, in the Cabala as in grammatology, tied to its being constituted by pure letters, Benjamin explicitly states that the language of redeemed humanity has "burst the chains of writing" and is a language that "is not written, but festively celebrated." Here Benjamin opposes the Cabalas writing of what was never said with a "reading of what was never written." If the letters that compose the unpronounceable name of God are what destines human language to historical transmission and infinite interpretation, we may then say that universal language [i.e., pure language] represents the definitive cancellation and resolution of these</page><page sequence="24">92 • The Muse of Translation letters, the definitive and absolute utterance of Gods name in speech [parole , also "words"]. (Agamben i999d, 57-58) Written in 1983, this characterization of Derridean grammatology closely evokes the language of "literality" in Derridas argument in "Des Tours de Babel," and is entirely in keeping with Agambens early critiques of gram- matology and deconstruction, in which he views it as a sort of grapho- and especially grammocentrism (the letter or gramma as the originary negative foundation of language) that successfiilly lays bare the aporias of metaphys- ics but nevertheless places an injunction on inquiring into the more obscure presuppositions underlying the logic of representation and signification in general, to which, according to Agamben, the semiotic terms and concepts of grammatology remain bound.13 As Agamben writes in 1977 s Stanzas : "The metaphysics of writing and of the signifier is but the reverse face of the metaphysics of the signified and the voice, and not, surely, its transcendence" (1993b, 156). And in 1982s Language and Death : "[T]hat which thought at- tempts to categorize as the mystical, or the Groundless, or the gramma, is simply a repetition of the fundamental notion of ontotheology" (1991» xiii). Yet this barred or evaded inquiry into the presupposition of signification and representation is exactly what Agamben claims is at stake in Benjamins concept of "pure language," a language that has precisely canceled its letters and "burst the chains of writing." But what, then, is this language that has burst the chains of writing, and why for Agamben is the figure of writing precisely the obstacle to our thinking this pure language? There are a number of ways to approach this issue in Agamben s work, but here the approach will be through his reading of the question of translation in literature. In truth, Agamben has not dealt extensively with the question of translation as such- even though he has done a considerable amount of it. Nevertheless like de Man and Derrida, Agamben follows the Benjaminian in- sight that "pure language" is brought to light particularly by the dynamics of translation and bilingualism, and like de Man, in essays dedicated to, among others, two authors already discussed, Agamben identifies translation with literature- with the language of literature- itself. Indeed, the choice of texts in the first section of this essay was not an arbitrary one, for Delfini and, to</page><page sequence="25">Kevin Attell • 93 a lesser extent, Landolfi are evocatively discussed by Agamben in the essays "The Dictation of Poetry" and "An Enigma Concerning the Basque Woman," both collected in the volume The End of the Poem: Studies in Poetics .14 In a long autobiographical narrative that he added as a sort of preface to a later edition of his collected stories (and which Agamben defines as a razo , that is, the short prose narrative often added to troubadour poems describing the events that led to the poems composition), Delfini describes a chance encounter he had had early in the spring of 1937 in a train station in Florence. While waiting for a train to Bologna, he noticed a father with his io-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter. The brother and sister were having a conversation in a language of "such touching sweetness that upon hearing them [his] heart seemed to want to stop its own beating and leave things suspended forever in that moment" (1963b, 92). Though the only word he could make out in their hypnotic conversation was the Spanish entonces spoken by the girl, Delfini, out of his fascination and sympathy for the Basque people ("the most ancient of all the people of Europe" [92]) during the Spanish Civil War, imagined them to be Basque. Thus the first of many odd linguistic displacements or ambiguities surrounding this story.15 The sweet language that Delfini half-heard that day was evidently Spanish, and yet, he tells us, out of the one intelligible word, which "held within it the poetry and wisdom of the greatest and most noble library in the world" (95), came in the months following the encounter elaborate images of the family returned to the Basque country, of the girl as a refugee, of the father as a rebel leader, of their tragedy engulfed by even greater tragedies. What also came out of this encounter was "a jumble that no one understood, a story: 'The Memory of the Basque Girl'" (95)- a story that ends with the unidentified and untranslated verses noted above. In his brief essay on Delfini s story, Agamben asks (of both this unknown girl at the station and the fictional Isabella de Aranzadi whom she would become): "Who is the Basque girl? And why is she characterized by an impenetrable speaking in tongues'?" (1999c, 120, translation modified). He suggests two possible answers. The first is that in its impenetrability and unintelligibility, the verses that close the story allude to an inner experience that transcends the mediation of communicative, historical language and</page><page sequence="26">94 • The Muse of Translation would be something like the speaking in tongues of which Paul writes in i Corinthians 14:2 (120), an immediate speaking to God whose syllables remain unintelligible to all other humans. It is certainly the case that the unintel- ligibility of the words Delfini heard spoken by the Spanish girl in the Florence train station and of the indescribable voice out of which the memorial image of Isabella emerges for Giacomo Disvetri proves to be precisely the central characteristic of the half-heard language of the heart that is at issue here. And it is furthermore unlikely that any of the words comprising the storys final stanza of poetry would be recognizable to a speaker or reader of any Indo-European language. Thus we might indeed postulate a final fall (or as- cent) into a sort of Pauline glossolalia as the closing gesture of Delfini s tale, with whatever interpretations we might then attach to this gesture. However plausible such a reading might be, Agamben nevertheless raises it only to reject it. And this rejection is based on the fact that though unidentified and untranslated in the story, the verses nevertheless prove to be eminently identifiable and translatable. For as Agamben notes- and corrobo- rates with the testimony of specialists with whom he has corresponded- the poem is in fact a stanza of Basque poetry, which can be translated thus: My beloved star, my charming one, in silence to contemplate you do I approach the window. When the poem is born on my lips, stay sleeping: let my song be to you like a dream in the night. (1999c, 123) And because the touching scene described here is clearly paraphrased in the final moments of Delfini s story, it is evident that he knew the meaning of the lines, though *[h]ow he procured the text and the linguistic com- petence to understand the poem is a problem [Agamben leaves] to future biographers* (122).16</page><page sequence="27">Kevin Attell • 95 However that may be, the fact that the story does not end with an in- vented or undiscoverable language is central to the reading Agamben gives to the text (and he suggests as well that this might lead us to reconsider the "unintelligible composition at the center of [Landolfi's] Dialogo dei mas- simi sistemi , whose real character will now have to be verified" [1999c, 123]). Indeed, the crucial point for Agamben is the fact that what is being staged here is the tension and incommensurability of (at least) two historical lan- guages, and thus "An Enigma Concerning the Basque Woman" constitutes, in its oblique way, a compact treatise on translation. For Agamben, Delfini s Basque girl evokes precisely that disjunction among the languages that the translator s- and, as de Man suggests, the poets- work insistently reveals: not a transport to an immediate "speaking in tongues" or "glossolalia" but "the radical diglossia of the poetic experience" (121): "The disappearance of the Basque girl," he writes, "is eternal, since she is eternally missing in the languages of men, which bear witness to her in the Babelic discord of their many idioms alone" (121, translation modified). What then is this diglossie "poetic experience" and, just as important (since this will determine in large part Agambens distance from a decon- structive reading), is this category valorized or not in Agambens thought? The Basque girl is a figure for what has "eternally" disappeared from, or what withdraws itself from, the Babelic languages of men. She is as well, and in equal measure, the object of love that is invoked in poetic language since she is, as Agamben notes, "inscribed in the tradition of the Stilnovist and Pro- vençal senhal among Beatrice, Giovanna, Miellz de Domna, Dezirada, Bon Vezi" (1999a, 84). The significance of this allusion and the evident conflation of poetic diglossia and a beloved woman may at first be puzzling, but they become clear once this reading of Delfini (whom Agamben also calls "the most authentic heir to the troubadour and Dolce Stil Novo tradition" [81]) is placed in relation to the theory of poetic language that Agamben had de- veloped in his earlier work on medieval lyric. As is well known, at the heart of Stilnovist and troubadour poetic language (the language of "courtly love") is a highly stylized and conventional amorous relation to an inaccessible beloved, the senhal But as Agamben argues over the course of texts such as Stanzas and Language and Death : The Place of Negativity, that beloved is not</page><page sequence="28">96# The Muse of Translation a biographical or even physical woman, but language itself- or to be more precise, the taking place of language- of which the poet seeks to have an immediate experience. In the seventh chapter oiLangaage and Death, Agamben provides perhaps the most forceful exposition of his theory of poetic language and its relation to the Western metaphysical tradition (and specifically to the negativity on which, Agamben believes, metaphysics is founded). In an exposition that takes him from ancient rhetoric to early Christian philosophy of language to the decisive innovations of the troubabour poets, Agamben focalizes the argument through the lens of the changing fortunes of the rhetorical term "topics." According to Agamben, in ancient rhetoric the term "topics" origi- nally referred to the "places" ( topoi ) where human discourse arises, and this rhetorical art was conceived as "a technique of the originary advents of lan- guage" (1991, 66), thus constituting a sort of linguistic first philosophy. Topics soon devolved, however, into a series of mnemonic techniques for the orator to organize and locate in now pregiven "places" the various elements of an argument. In this devolution from a technique for thinking and experiencing the originary advent of language to a technique for "constructing an artificial dwelling (a memorial') in which these events were fixed as always already given and completed" (67), Agamben describes in quasi-historical terms the ascendancy of certain orthodoxy concerning the nature of language and our always belated and negative relation to it. Ihis classical and canonical understanding of topics, however, gets taken up and, Agamben argues, "reinterpreted in a radically new way by the Pro- vençal poets, giving rise to modern European poetry" (1991, 67). What is it that the troubadours initiate with their reformulation of classical topics, and does this new poetry indeed hold out the possibility of "another experience of language . . . that does not rest on an unspeakable [i.e., negative] foundation" (66)? In contrast to classical rhetoricians, Agamben writes, "The troubadours do not wish to recall arguments already in use by a topos, but rather they wish to experience the topos of all topoi , that is, the very taking place of language as originary argument, from which alone arguments in the sense of classical rhetoric may derive" (68, translation modified). And they arrive at this project via the Augustinián account of the way humankind, which has</page><page sequence="29">Kevin Attell • 97 been expropriated of language, must necessarily come to the place of lan- guage through appetitus or amorous desire. Having charted these semantic shifts (and the curious conversion) of the terms "love" and "topics," Agamben claims that this conflation of the two is the dynamic that leads to "amors" becoming "the name the troubadours gave to the experience of the advent of the poetic word" (1991, 68). Thus when Agamben asks of Delfinis senhor, "Who is the Basque girl?," it is important to specify that for him troubadour love poetry "is not a question of psychological or biographical events that are successively expressed in words, but rather, of the attempt to live the topos itself, the event of language as a fundamental amorous experience* (68). That is to say, at stake in this love poetry is the experience of language itself.17 But for all the promise and correctness of this poetic intention, the trou- badours' poetic thought is on Agambens account still marked by the nega- tivity that characterizes the Western reflection on language, as is revealed by the way the troubadours tended to conceive of this place and of this experience "in terms of nothingness," as in William IX, Duke of Aquitaines "Farai un vers de dreyt nien" (1991, 69). This important qualification is enough to remind us that recovering some sort of authentic medieval or modern "poetic experience" is not in truth the ultimate telos of Agambens inquiry; or to put this in the terms of the Delfini article noted a moment ago, arriv- ing at and describing the diglossia , the essential and aporetic bilingualism, of the poetic word is not the final endpoint of Agambens itinerary. Rather, understanding the nature and origin of that diglossia is precisely the achieve- ment that might lead us to the new experience of language, or experimentům linguae , of which Agamben speaks in the razo , as it were, that he later added as an introduction to his 1977 book Infancy and History. Defining there the fundamental problem of philosophy as a matter of the "way in which it ar- ticulates the question of the limits of language," Agamben presents his own project as an "attempt to think through these limits in a direction other than that of the vulgarly ineffable. The ineffable, the un-said, are in fact categories which belong exclusively to human language; far from indicating a limit of language, they express its invincible power of presupposition, the unsayable being precisely what language must presuppose in order to signify" (1993a, 4). Although it is true that the historical languages entail a presupposed</page><page sequence="30">98 • The Muse of Translation impossibility of saying (which is specifically illuminated by translations nec- essary inability to mend their incommensurability), and that any experience of human language must account for this seemingly constitutive negativity, this unsayability/negativity is nevertheless only the site of a very specific impasse produced by the semiotic nature of the constituted languages. As Agamben writes, "what is experienced in the experimentům linguae is not merely an impossibility of saying: rather it is an impossibility of speaking from the basis of a language (una lingua)" (7). The negative diglossia of poetic experience, then, is not reine Sprache , and it is here that we can best observe, while remaining within the present discussions thematics of translation, the difference between Agamben s posi- tion and the deconstructive positions regarding the nature of language and its foundational status. At issue in Agambens critique of deconstruction is not the precision of Derridas argument, but the limit it places on interrogat- ing its most fundamental presuppositions. For Agamben, the logic of decon- struction stops at the impasse that it exposes (with unprecedented force) in the structure of the semiological system of language. However, integrally identifying the logic of the sign with the nature of language as such, and equating this irreducibly semiological and grammatological model of lan- guage with the limit of thought itself is precisely the injunction that prevents the passage from the languages of men to that pure language that has, in Benjamins words, "burst the chains of writing." In the Delfini essay, Agamben describes this limit as a "purely theological presupposition: the dwelling of the word in the beginning, of logos in arche , that is, the absolutely primordial status of language" (1999a, 77), understanding "language" and "logos" here to mean the language of structuralist and post-structuralist semiology, "the theory of the supremacy of the letter or gramma (as the originary negative foundation of language), which, starting with Derrida, appears in innumer- able forms in contemporary French thought" (i999d, 57). This theological presupposition is, for Agamben, not only what essentially characterizes Ben- jamins "languages of men" (that is, in their Babelic multiplicity) as opposed to language as such or pure language, but also- more pointedly- precisely the model of language that lies undisturbed at the root of the deconstructive analysis.</page><page sequence="31">Kevin Attell • 99 As is well known, Derrida has extensively argued that the Western meta- physical tradition has been grounded on an unwavering assumption of the primordiality of presence, an assumption that his work spectacularly exposes and unravels. Agamben, however, makes a diametrically opposed claim about this same tradition, namely, that it is founded on negativity. Although the history and scope of this debate cannot be accounted for fully in the space of this essay, some of its essential elements can be seen in these proximate yet contesting views of translation. Though following different lines of argumen- tation, Agamben, de Man, and Derrida all find in the question of translation an illustration of this "place of negativity" (be it called materiality, différance, or diglossia ), and yet Agamben, while acknowledging his solidarity with the deconstructive account up until this point, finds that there is still another step to be taken- one that is less the deconstruction of metaphysics (which for Agamben leaves the foundational negativity in place) than the attempt to take something like the Heideggerian "step back beyond metaphysics,' ' and beyond its foundational negativity. This is the reason why Agamben can, and often does, praise deconstruction for having brought to light better than any thought before it the fundamental underlying structure of that tradition, but it is for this same reason that Agamben has consistently and critically char- acterized deconstruction as being unable or unwilling to venture past the paradoxes and aporias that it so tirelessly reveals, that is to say, beyond this negative theological and metaphysical presupposition which, at the dawn of modern European poetry, the troubadour poets were able to intuit but were still unable to step back beyond. As Agamben continues in the Defini essay: "This uninterrogated persistence of a theological foundation shows itself in the fact that the original structure of the poetic work remains marked by negativity: the primordiality of the logos thus quickly becomes the primacy of the signifier and the letter, and the origin reveals itself as trace. (It is here that the deconstructionist factory establishes its residence)" (1999a, 77). By contrast, in a phrase whose polemical overtones are meant to be heard, in the introduction to Language and Death, Agamben writes that "it [is] important that the structure of this negative foundation . . . should not simply be replicated in our reflection, but that finally, an attempt might be made to understand it" (1991, xiii). For Agamben, Benjamin sees this structure</page><page sequence="32">100 • The Muse of Translation plain, and his concept of pure language is precisely an attempt to understand and step back beyond the negativity of the languages of men, to conceive of a language that has burst the chains of writing and moved beyond the negative ground of the gramma. This new "experience of language which is not merely a silence or a deficiency of names, but one whose logic can be indicated, whose site and formula can be designated, at least up to a point" (1993a, 6), is, for Agamben, none other that the experience of pure language, "the only language that accomplishes the crystalline elimination of the unsayable in language* that Benjamin evoked in a letter to Martin Buber in July 1916" (i999d, 54). And it is precisely in this project- which is Agambens project- that the task of the translator and the task of the philosopher converge. "The task of the philosopher, like that of the translator, is to 'describe' and 'intimate this single true language, which seeks to show itself* and constitute itself' in the becoming of languages" (i999d, 53). The divergence of the Agambenian position and the de Manian and Derridean position on translation thus provides a key to reading the ways these theoretical camps not only "[articulate] the question of the limits of language" (Agamben 1993a, 4) but also pose the fundamental problems of metaphysics. In their readings of Benjamins reine Sprache , Agamben, de Man, and Derrida ali converge on a crucial point at which the aporias of both signification and metaphysics come to light, a point at which the nega- tive or differential structure of metaphysical semiology is laid bare, and as in the Landolfi story with which this essay began, we are confronted with a deep uncertainty about what language ultimately is. This point is crucial in a "literal" sense, insofar as it marks a crossroads at which two divergent philosophical projects- two massimi sistemi , as it were- meet and then take differing paths, which are still being cleared and charted. In the "higher and purer linguistic air" of translation (Benjamin 1996b, 257), where the Babelic event is continuously reenacted, two possible directions for thought are thus projected, two ways of thinking (at) the end of metaphysics. 000 "There is no muse of philosophy, nor is there one of translation," Benjamin writes (1996b, 259). By this he means to emphasize that the philosopher and</page><page sequence="33">Kevin Attell • 101 the translator are embarked on similar- and perhaps identical- tasks, that they are in search of the same thing: "If there is such a thing as a language of truth, a tensionless and even silent depository of the ultimate secrets for which all thought strives, then this language of truth is- the true language. And this very language, in whose divination and description lies the only perfection for which the philosopher can hope, is concealed in concentrated fashion in translations' (259). Though it is certainly true that none of the nine muses presides directly over translation or philosophy, Socrates neverthe- less does recount to Phaedrus how after they die, the cicadas report to both Calliope and Urania (the oldest of the muses, who "preside over the heavens and all discourse") about which mortals have "honor[ed] their special kind of music by leading a philosophical life" (Plato 1997, 536).18 And because transla- tors work on pure language, patiently bringing this ultimate philosophical desideratum to light, perhaps the cicadas will speak well of them too. C - - &gt; NOTES I would like to thank Jesse Molesworth for his comments on an earlier draft of this essay. All unattributed translations in the text are my own. 1. The first in Landolfi (1963), the second in Landolfi (1986). Citations of "Dialogo" in English in this essay will be to the latter volume. 2. See Heller-Roazen (2005, i95ff) and Searls (2009, 87fr). Searls's story, in fact, thematizes the translation of this title. 3. The version of Galileos 1632 text to which I refer is the University of California Press edition (1953, with subsequent reprints). 4. Although this would seem to make Agamben and Bompiani s II Monaco a translation of a translation, the issue is even more intriguing than that, for the status of Artaud's Le Moine is rather unusual. In letter to Jean Paulhan at La Nouvelle Revue Française (March 21, 1931), where he had hoped to publish an extract from his translation of The Monk, Artaud writes, "I have put infinitely more into this book than a simple translation. Entire episodes and chapters are of my own invention" (1982, 322). This is probably not what an editor wants to hear from a translator, and indeed there is a great deal of Artaud in Le Moine. Among the many changes, one worth noting here is that Artaud adds an Avertissment in which he tells the reader that although there have so far been three French translations of Lewis's novel, "The present edition . . .</page><page sequence="34">102 • The Muse of Translation is neither a translation nor an adaptation . . . but a sort of copy' in French of the original English text. As if of a painter who copies the great work of an Old Master" (1982, 322). Artaud s Monk was published in 1931, yet in a letter of April 3, 1933, to Anaïs Nin, Artaud admits that he reads English "really badly, as it were, not at all" (1982, 333). In fact it appears he largely made his copy directly from Léon de Wailly s 1840 translation. So Artaud s Monk is not really a translation at all, and in fact it doesn't really purport to be. As Artaud puts it in another letter to Paulhan (January 13, 1931), "One must not take the work [I've] done as a translation or even an adaptation. I have retold [raconté] The Monk as if from memory, and in my own fashion" (1982, 321). 5. Leland de la Durantaye was perhaps the first to comment on this particular point of contact (2000, 5-9). 6. See Jacobs (1975. 765) 7. "The act of critical, theoretical reading performed by a critic like Friedrich Schlegel and performed by literary theory in general- by means of which the original work is not imitated or reproduced but is to some extent put in motion, de-canonized, questioned in a way which undoes its claim to canonical authority- is similar to what a translator performs" (de Man 1986a, 82-83). 8. Culler's account of the strategic function of this terminological instability resonates with similar observations made by Rodolphe Gasché (1998, 1-2) and Fredric Jameson (1991, 238). It also accords with what at first appears to be a passing comment de Man makes in a footnote but in fact turns out to offer an indispensable insight into how to read de Man's elusive vocabulary. In reference to a use of the term "tradition" in the essay "Reading and Historyf de Man notes: "The use of 'tradition' in this context is one of the numerous occasions in which one can share Rousseau's naïve regret that we have no diacritical mark at our disposal by which to indicate irony. It also indicates that, try as I may, when I seem to be reproaching Jauss for not freeing himself from classical constraints, I am not more liberated from them than he is" (1986c, 71 n. 28). It is an odd note, not least because we do have at our disposal scare quotes, which would seem to function perfectly well around the word "tradition" here. De Man does not use them, but instead gives us a cryptic indication of how on "numerous occasions" words in his texts are invisibly marked by this invisible diacritical mark. It is also not an accident that the "tradition" referred to in this note is that of Benjamin. 9. Andrzej Warminski calls attention to this distinction between definition and denomination with regard to de Man's use of the term "ideology." See his introduction to de Man's Aesthetic Ideology (1996, 13). 10. For example, the "materiality of the letter" (de Man 1986a, 89), the "materiality of an inscription" (1986b, 51), the "word ... in its materiality" (1986a, 87). See also "the materiality of actual history" in "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric" (1984. 262). 11. See, for example, these comments from 1982: "[T]he investment in the aesthetic is considerable- the whole ability of philosophical discourse to develop as such depends entirely on its ability to develop an adequate aesthetics. This is why both Kant and Hegel, who had little interest in the arts, had to put it in, to make possible</page><page sequence="35">Kevin Attell • 103 the link between real events and philosophical discourse" (cited in Warminski's introduction to de Man 1996, 4). 12. De Man recounts how in the seminars that led to "Des Tour de Babel," Derrida was using a translation (Gandillac s) that at one key point had incorrectly rendered Benjamins "translatable" as "untranslatable," until a participant in the seminar pointed out the error. De Man comments, "I'm sure Derrida could explain that it was the same . . . and I mean that in a positive sense, it is the same, but still, it is not the same without some additional explanation" (1986a, 80). It appears that de Man had not read the published text of "Des Tours de Babel," but in any case he seems to have precisely intuited Derrida's argument. 13. For a fuller discussion of this argument, see my "An Esoteric Dossier: Agamben and Derrida Read Saussure" (2009). 14. It is striking how many of the essays collected in The End of the Poem have to do indirectly with questions of translation and bilingualism: how to gloss the meaning of the troubadours' obscure and rare word corn in " Corn : from Anatomy to Poetics"; the estrangement produced by the hybrid lingua poliphylesca of the Hypnerotomachia Polifili in "The Dream of Language"; the question of the relation between poetry and dead languages in "Pascoli and the Thought of the Voice." 15. Another being the title, provisional versions of which Delfini s notes show to have included "Il Ricordo della Ragazza," "Il Ricordo della Ragazza di B.," and- oddly- "Le souvenir de la Basque" (see Delfini 2008, 358). 16. The present essay is hardly a biography of Delfini, but it can contribute something to this particular problem. Whereas Agamben and his correspondents are certainly correct in identifying it as a Basque poem, by the late nineteenth century "Ene izar maitea" was in fact a popular Basque song, which Delfini may even have heard sung somewhere. Since it is precisely written out in his text, however, it is most likely he came across it in a collection of Basque lyrics or perhaps a history of the Basque people, such as Julien Vinson's Les Basques et le pays basque: moeurs, langage et histoire, where the text is even accompanied by a musical setting (1882, 130-33)- 17. From the essay "The Dream of Language": "Beatrice is the name of the amorous experience of the event of language at play in the poetic text itself. She is thus the name and the love of language, but of language understood not in its grammaticality but, rather, in its radical primordiality, as the emergence of verse from the pure Nothing" (Agamben 1999b, 58). 18. Agamben also notes in Language and Death that, in fact, Plato (1997) identifies philosophy as the "supreme music" (in Phaedo 61a) and refers to the muse of philosophy as the "true muse" (in Republic 548b) (Agamben 1991, 78).
