IN metaphysics every age seems to have its pet absurdity, which subsequent ages come to regard with mingled wonder and amusement. We can laugh at the mediaeval fancy of substantial seczindae, or at the Leibnitzian doctrine that if two things, say two drops of water, were so like each other that you could not tell the difference between them, they were not really two at all but only one. It is certain, however, that a succeeding age will laugh just as heartily at the doctrine, widely accepted in our age, that all the things which are for us the very type of reality, on which the very conception of reality itself is modelled, are not themselves real. While natural science makes a steady progress, it seems to be a law in the history of distinctively philosophical speculation that the paradoxes of one age become the orthodoxy of the next, to be looked on in turn by the next again, not only as paradoxes, but as absurdities. The reason of the difference between the two lies in this, that nothing has as yet been generally recognized as bearing in regard to the theories of the subject sciences the same relation that the test of comparison with fact bears to the theories of physics. I have endeavored' elsewhere to shew what it is that, as it seems to me, ought to be held to bear that relation to them; that any theory which does violence to the natural use of language may as well be rejected summarily and at once. If it is not, at any rate the Time Spirit will 1 "Reality and Causation," Mind, N.S., vol. IV, no. 13.</page><page sequence="2">I 14 T HE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. assuredly see to it that it is rejected later on. The nearest approach that we can have to the test of fact in metaphysics, is the trial of every general statement by its application to some concrete individual instance. The great name of Kant can no more sanctify the absurdity that the continual citation of test instances is undesirable in philosophy, than the great name of Plato can sanctify the parallel absurdity that the study of individual facts will never lead to the true advancement of knowledge in physics. Another world-famous paradox that has emanated from the same source as the idealist riddle, is the doctrine with regard to causation, now extensively accepted, that causation consists in nothing else than the constant conjunction of events. The fate of this doctrine has been, in some respects, very different from that of idealism. While idealism is neglected by the scientific world, as something with which it has no concern, something about which the metaphysicians may spin what cobwebs they please, but which the man of science will leave carefully alone, the reduction of causation to mere conjunction, which springs from the same root, and rests on the same grounds with it, has been taken up warmly by natural philoso- phers, in England at any rate; and has been proclaimed as the true and only doctrine, with a dogmatic confidence very different from the modest recognition of its paradoxical charac- ter with which its author introduced it. The invariable conjunction of two facts is, we are told, the full content of the conception of causation. Not only is the connection of cause and effect nothing else but such invariable conjunction, but the very notion of it contains, in the last analysis, they say, nothing else but the thought of such inva- riable conjunction. If that were so, however, the question must surely arise at the very outset: How is it that scientific investigation consists in using the fact of the invariable con- junction between events in order to prove their causal connec- tion? Do we use their invariable conjunction merely to prove their invariable conjunction? If that is all that we are doing, we might as well save ourselves the trouble. The fact of the</page><page sequence="3">No. 2.] THE HUMIST DOCTRRINE OF CA USA TION. II5 one being used to prove the other is, however, sufficient evidence that they are not the same. The question must also surely arise: How is it that, if the meaning of cause and effect is nothing but constant conjunction, we can use the words 'cause' and 'effect' intelligently long before we know anything about constant conjunctions? If a child is asked why he is crying, and answers that it is because his brother struck him, can anything be more absurd than to imagine that what is running in his mind is the constant conjunction between blows and tears: a conjunction which, as constant, does not exist; and which he could know nothing about, if it did. We may take it as perfectly certain, pace Hume and Mill, that 'cause' does mean for us something more than constant con- junction, and the interesting fact to get at is, what that is in which this added meaning consists. Let us suppose that the rotundity of the earth were still undiscovered, but that it had been observed by navigators that, in whatever part of the world they were, when they met an approaching vessel, the tops of the masts appeared first, and the hull last; and that the converse happened when the vessel receded. We should then have a conjunction of the most rigid invariability, and we should probably in these circumstances find some Greek word that would express the idea uppermost part first appearing,' or the converse, and would call what that word expressed, provisionally, the cause of the phenomenon. This would be analogous to our calling the weight of bodies the cause of their falling, while it is really nothing more than an expression for the fact that, when left unsupported, they always do fall. When, however, we subsequently discovered that the earth was a sphere, we should then feel that we now, for the first time, understood the reason of the observed uniformity; that we were at last in possession of the true cause. We have, then, in such a case as this, the distinction given us between the true cause and the invariable conjunction which, for want of any other cause, we often treat as a cause, though quite conscious that we are not using language alto- gether literally in doing so; and it must strike any one at a</page><page sequence="4">1i6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL RE VIEW. [VOL. V. glance that there is between the two, between the subordinate law and the true cause, the relation that there is between the glimpse of a part and the perception of the whole. Mill is so full of the conception of Induction as something that leads to wider generalizations, and wider generalizations only, that, when he comes across an induction that leads to the dis- covery of the cause itself, he does not know what to make of it. When Kepler discovered that the orbit of Mars was an ellipse, he discovered the cause of its successive apparent positions. Mill is of opinion that Kepler's process of thought in arriving at his great discovery is not to be reckoned as reasoning at all, but as some operation subsidiary to it.1 He further thinks, that such a conclusion differs from an induction like Gravitation in that, while the latter must be true or false, it is a matter of indifference whether the former is a truth in itself or not, so long as it serves as a kind of mnemonic rhyme to hold the facts together.2 Surely, however, it is quite beyond question that the two discoveries stand on precisely the same footing in this respect. Both must explain the facts and both must be either true or false in themselves. Have we, then, in the conception of whole and part, and the relation between the two, something that will give us a clue to the relation between cause and effect? Before answering that question, let us glance at some other instances of causation. The instances that Hume cites are uniformly such instances as the connection between flame and heat, or between cold and ice, that is to say, between the sensations which an outward object gives rise to for one of our senses and those which it gives rise to for another. They are, it is true, instances of a causal connection, but they are surely not the only ones nor the most obvious ones. Why pass over such clearer and more familiar instances as the moving of a book, or the filling of a glass, or the doing of any of the innumerable acts of daily life that we express by means of a transitive verb followed by an 1 Mill's Logic, 3d ed., bk. III, ch. II, " Of Induction Improperly so Called," ? 3, p. 301. 2 Ibid., ? 4, pp. 308 ff.</page><page sequence="5">No. 2.] THE HUMIST DOCTRINE OF CA USA TION. I 17 accusative case; or why, again, pass over such other more obvious instances as the connection between the foot and the track, or between last night's rain and the pools of water in the streets to-day? There seems to be some principle in human nature which tends to make us overlook the obvious and familiar in favor of the unusual and remote. It has even, as we know, led some primitive races to overlook the part which the mother sustains in childbearing, and to put her husband to bed when there is an addition to the family. If any one without a theory to support were asked what meaning he attached to the word cause,' he would be very likely to answer 'that which does something.' There is a shade of difference in meaning, however, between 'doing' and 'causing,' which is not to be neglected. The two words are naturally and continually applied to the selfsame fact, but in different circumstances, and from a different point of view. I move your ink-bottle while you are out of the room. That, from my point of view, is simply 'doing something.' You come back, and find it moved. On enquiry you ascertain that my moving it was the 'cause' of its change of place. The expression ' doing something' implies that the fact as a whole is regarded in itself, while the conception of 'cause' imports that there was a gap to be filled up; that your first knowledge of it was fragmentary, but that now you can fill up the missing links. We are thus brought back to the conception, that the knowledge of the fact and its cause together is the knowledge of it as a whole, while the knowledge of the effect alone is the knowledge of a fragment only. The problem of causation is often stated somewhat in this way: "d Granted that we always conclude that everything that begins to exist must have a cause, what makes us do so? Is the belief intuitive, or is it a generalization from experience?" It seems to me, however, that what is here taken for granted, itself requires examination. In what sense is it true, or is it true at all, that we at once conclude that whatever begins to exist must have a cause? If by ' we' is meant the whole human race, it certainly is not true. Children and uneducated</page><page sequence="6">I i8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL RETVIEW. [VOL. V. people generally accept most of the facts of life and nature as they find them, and never think of enquiring as to their cause. Savages ordinarily regard such enquiries as why the sun rises and sets, or even whether it is the same sun that rises to-day as that which set yesterday, as entirely meaningless and non- sensical.' Yet there are some events which raise the thought of causation as quickly and as unfailingly in the mind of the savage as in the mind of the philosopher. A footprint on the sand would have made Friday, as certainly as Crusoe, conclude that it did not come there uncaused. If we enquire what such events are, as distinguished from other events, we will find that they are events which, by their very presentation, make mani- fest to him who observes them, their fragmentary character. Any child will recognize that a face which looks at him over a wall, or a hand which is stretched from behind a screen, are not self-subsistent things, but parts of some wider unity. When he sees the body they belong to, he is completely satis- fied; he thinks he has the full cause before him. As knowledge advances, however, we come to learn that many of the things which we at first regarded as self-subsistent wholes are, in another sense, parts of some wider whole. We seek always to reconstruct the whole from what we know of its parts ; and thus our goal, the ultimate cause of all that we perceive and know, continually recedes before us. It must be observed, however, that our recognition of the fact that what we at first thought of as wholes are fragments of a wider unity, does not prevent us from continuing to dis- tinguish between such wholes and the things that, relatively to them, are fragments. If any one could shew how, at a glance, we distinguish between a whole and a fragment, and how it is that the fragment often gives us a clue that enables us to reconstruct the whole, he would have gone far to solve the problem of causation. Wholes and fragments are infinitely various in kind. The first unity, on the model of which we frame all other unities, is the object that can be held in the 1 Cp. Lubbock, Origin of Civilization, p. 25I; also Park's Travels, vol. I, p. 265.</page><page sequence="7">No. 2.] THE HUMIST DOCTRINE OF CA USA TION. I 19 hand, characterized by homogeneity of substance. If it were not so characterized, and if there were no unity of purpose discernible in it, we should not think of it as one thing, but as two things conjoined. The parts of solid wholes of this sort, if broken, continue to fit each other; and this fact gives us the rudimentary conception of fitness, which plays such an important part afterwards in causation. Wholeness or unity, however, may consist, not in homogeneity of substance, but in regularity of form. If the form is such as that of the circle, the smallest part of the arc may enable us to reconstruct the whole. It may consist also in nothing but the unity of purpose manifested in a complex object such as a house or a bridge, and then it is only by suggesting the purpose of the whole, that the fragment can assist us. Besides the unity of the 'thing,' and even in a manner before it, there is the primitive unity of the 'fact,' that is, of the total of presentation at any moment. Caesar's assassination, for instance, is such a unity. The Senate House with the assembled Senate, the Dictator himself, the conspirators with their daggers, all for a moment form part of one whole; all, when they separate, still bear traces of having been fragments of it. To the widely pervasive fact that they do so, we owe it that it is often possible to trace out causes from their effects alone. As in the broken solid the parts continue to fit each other, so in the broken fact we have a parallel phenomenon. The foot continues to fit the track that it has made; the wound, perhaps, the instrument that caused it. In the case cited, the fact was one witnessed by many persons, and capable of being reconstituted for others by their narration of its circumstances. In many other such cases, however, there is no witness of such a fact, and it often becomes our task to endeavor to reconstitute it, as best we can, from the fragments in our possession. Mill's Inductive Methods are supposed to be applicable to reasonings of every sort, whether scientific or practical. As a matter of fact, almost all his examples are drawn either from chemistry, or from those branches of physics in which the causation is, in his appropriate phrase, heteropathic, that is to</page><page sequence="8">I20 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. say, in which the change that takes place is a metamorphosis. If any one were to attempt to apply them to the explanation of the mental process that we use in piecing together circum- stantial evidence, so as to bring home to the murderer (let us say) the guilt of his crime, he certainly would not know where to begin. The methods all take it for granted that the fact to be enquired into is repeatable, that you can have "two or more instances of the phenomenon " as a datum to begin with. You can have, of course, as many instances as you please of oxygen and hydrogen combining to form water, but you cannot have more than one instance of an individual murder. You cannot put the murderer and his victim together, and see whether he will kill him over again. The methods also take it for granted that you have, to begin with, two parts of the series that constitute a fact, say the administration of arsenic and the resulting death; and that the enquirer wants only to know how to fill up the missing links ; but, in innumerable causal enquiries, we have not as our datum two parts of the series, but only one, - only, for instance, the footprint on the sand; and on the manner in which, from one such fact, we proceed to infer its cause, it is forever impossible that methods which postulate the conjunction of two things as their datum can throw any light whatever. In spite indeed of their great, though mainly insular, success, it is quite certain that, even in regard to the branches of investigation to which they are more directly applicable, the celebrated methods have never been of the smallest use to any scientific investigator. The trouble is how to apply them. Mill sets them forth as if they were various instruments, one of which might be used in the investigation of one class of facts, and another in the investigation of another class. When we come to examples, however, we find that any conceivable judgment is an example into which the use of at least four out of the five methods enter, and generally the fifth also ; and that it is a mere matter of the point of view, which method we are to regard it as exemplifying. He says, for example, ' Dogs bark' is an instance of the Method of Agreement, because it</page><page sequence="9">No. 2.] THEI HIlMIST DOCTkINE OF CAUSATION. 121 means 'This dog, that dog, and the other dog bark'; while ' Fire burns' is an instance of the Method of Difference, because what is compared is the state of things before fire was introduced on the scene and after it.' But in ' Dogs bark' the state of things before they bark and after it, is also compared; and in ' Fire burns' our use of the words ' fire' and ' burns' implies general conceptions constituted by the perception of similarity between the present and other instances of fire, and the present and other instances of burning. The two examples are thus obviously examples of both methods at once, while the fact that they are so means that they are examples also of the method which he calls the Joint Method of Agreement and Difference. That all possible instances must be instances of all these methods, follows from the obvious and well worn truth, that we can make no affirmation with regard to any subject without making a corresponding negation. The state- ments that dogs bark and that fire burns, imply that dogs begin to bark, and that it begins to burn, and consequently that dogs were not barking, nor was it burning, before these processes respectively began. There is thus no possibility of marking off any conceivable instance, as more properly falling under the head of an example of one of these methods rather than of any other. The Method of Difference is treated throughout as that which, where applicable, is a decisive criterion of truth, as compared with the Method of Agreement, to which it is said that a large amount of uncertainty attaches. This, however, is purely arbitrary, and depends entirely upon the point of view. In some of Mill's own examples we find, on the contrary, that the Method of Agreement is appealed to, to confirm the informa- tion given by the Method of Difference. A bird, he instances, is taken from a cage and plunged in carbonic acid gas. It dies. That is an application of the Method of Difference.2 The fact of its dying at once, it is contended, is sufficient proof that immersion in the gas was the cause of suffocation; 1 Logic, 3d ed., vol. I, p. 439, footnote. 2 Ibid., p. 399.</page><page sequence="10">I 22 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. "at all events," he goes on to say, "after one or two repeti- tions," that is to say, after the Method of Difference has been supplemented by the Method of Agreement. In the example of the discovery of the cause of dew, he cites the case of the thermometer always registering a lower temperature when placed close to the bedewed object than when at some little distance from it, as an instance of the Method of Agreement.' We can regard it as such, if we put the emphasis on the word ' always' or some equivalent word. If we emphasize, on the contrary, the word ' lower,' it becomes an instance of the Method of Difference. Such a proof, at any rate, is as satis- factory a proof of the fact to be established as could be wished for; and has none of the uncertainty of the so-called Method of Agreement. The use of the adjective in the comparative degree is surely of itself enough to make it clear to the obtusest intellect, that it is an instance of the Method of Difference as well as of the Method of Agreement. It is, of course, an instance of the Joint Method also. If you use one thermometer and note the fall of the mercury, then it would come more properly under his conception of the Method of Difference. If you use two, and notice what they register respectively, then it would be more properly an instance of the Joint Method. There is clearly no genuine underlying principle of classification, in the distinctions between the various methods, which it is possible to follow out into individual instances. The charging of a Leyden jar is given as an instance of the Method of Agreement,2 and the discharging as an example of the Method of Difference,3 but plainly such an example could be turned topsy-turvy without in any way damaging it. Of the law of refracted rays he says, that it "was ascertained by direct measurement, and therefore by the Method of Agree- ment." 4 The Method of Agreement may evidently mean anything, from the vaguest analogy to the most absolute verification of a theory by comparison with fact. Of what value, then, can its formula be, or what possibility can there be 1 Logic, 3d ed., vol. I, p. 426. 2 Ibid., p. 422. 3Ibid., p. 423. 4 Ibid., p. 440, footnote.</page><page sequence="11">No. 2.] THE HUMIST DOCTRINE OF CA USA TION. 123 of applying it ? According to its formula, we have to find two instances of a phenomenon which have only one circumstance in common. If we can find them, we may conclude that they are causally connected. No-doubt we may; but such instances are never to be found ; they do not exist. The formula, instead of being the formula of the preliminary imperfect method that he represents it as being, is the formula of the ideal of scientific investigation, always striven after, but never altogether attained.' The Method of Difference, too, plainly means one thing in one place, and another thing altogether in another place. Often, indeed ordinarily, it means absolute ocular demonstra- tion of a fact, where, according to the current conception of inference, there is no room left for inference at all; and, for a writer who makes such fine-drawn distinctions between infer- ence and observation that he must place Kepler's law in the latter category, it seems a strange confusion of thought thus to apply it. In reference to the proof of the first law of motion, Mill says the Method of Concomitant Variations had to be used, because "friction, the resistance of the air, etc." could not be got rid of altogether. If they could, "the case would have been amenable to the Method of Difference." 2 That is to say, if they could, we should have had the fact of uniform perpetual motion before our eyes, and there would have been nothing left to infer. The Method of Difference, however, is also used for the ground of an inference of this description: that because, in observed instances, ideas of a pleasurable or painful character form associations more easily and strongly than other ideas, therefore they will do so in all instances.3 The truth is that almost anything can be said in logic by means of algebraical symbols, A B C, a b c, etc., and passed off as valid. Mill was certainly much more sparing in his use of such symbols than many subsequent writers, but when he has used them, they have not failed to mislead him. 1 Cf. Lotze, Logic (Translation, Clarendon Press Series), 2d ed., vol. II, pp. 23 and 24. 2 Mill, Logic, 3d ed., vol. I, p. 413. 3 Ibid., p. 499-</page><page sequence="12">124 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. The instances A B C, a b c, A D E, a d e, and so on, may stand for instances in which the agent and the thing acted on are the very same individual concrete subject and object, in the very same environment. Then the application of either method means that we have the fact inquired into before our eyes. Or they may stand for instances in which the agent and the patient are merely things belonging to the same class, - arsenic perhaps, but not the same arsenic; a man, but not the same man; or an animal, but perhaps not even one of the same species. The salient question, how far we may extend our analogies, concluding what we know to be true in one instance to be true in other instances ; or, in other words, in how far, and in what circumstances, we may regard instances as being practically identical, is precisely what is left out of account in the methods altogether. The Method of Concomitant Variations similarly means sometimes actual ocular evidence, sometimes inference by analogy.' The fact that bodies fall perpendicularly towards the earth, no matter how it rotates and travels, is cited as such an instance. It is plainly a matter of direct observation, com- bined with the deductive knowledge that the earth does rotate and travel. The commoner class of instances brought under this method are of a different sort altogether. They are such as the proof of the expansion of bodies by heat, which, of course, widely transcends the facts observed. The Method of Residues is treated as if it were a method that we make use of in an alternative fashion with the other four, but what does it mean really? It means simply using such previous knowledge as we possess, to narrow the field of inquiry. It is the first thing that is done in every conceivable case of reasoning. There is no possible enquiry of any sort from which its application is absent. Let us take one of Mill's instances, the instance of Dr. Wells' discovery of the theory of dew, and see what the mental process employed really is. What we begin with is of course what Mill calls the Method of Residues, that is, the application of our pre- 1 Mill, Logic, 3d ed., vol. I, p. 409,</page><page sequence="13">No. 2.] THE HUMIST DOCTRINE OF CAUSA TION. 1 25 vious well-established knowledge to narrowing down the matters of enquiry. We may, with Mill, leave out the strictly scientific generalizations with regard to the quantity of aqueous vapor that air, at a certain temperature, will hold, - though no one does, as a matter of fact, leave out in a real instance any- thing that he knows, and the mere supposition that he can do so is itself liable to be a source of illusion, -but, at any rate, we must not leave out of account the ordinary knowledge that every moderately educated European adult possesses. Such knowledge negatives at once a great variety of hypothetical explanations of the phenomenon, that might present them- selves to a child or a savage. It negatives such hypotheses as that the dew sprang into existence out of nothing, that it reached the place where we see it without passing through the intermediate space, or that it exuded from the substance, say the glass plate, on which it appears. It negatives every hypothesis indeed, except the hypothesis that the dewdrops, immediately before they existed as water in its visible form on the bedewed object, existed somehow as water in its invisible form in contact with it. How that happens is the residual phenomenon, the sole matter left to be enquired into. It is well, however, to note what are the essential limits of such an enquiry. We cannot reconstitute for sense the actual fact that happens in the deposition of dew, as we conceivably might, if we had instruments immensely more powerful than any that we possess. What, then, can we do ? At the most, no more than this: we can enquire what other phenomena there are in nature similar to the deposition of dew, and, if we know what goes on in the case of such phenomena, such knowledge may aid us in representing to ourselves what goes on in the case of the deposition of dew. Reason as a cognitive faculty is an extension of sense, but all that it can do for us in respect of facts that must forever remain hidden from sense, is to point out to us some fact with which we are familiar, and to say: "The fact that you are searching for is a fact of the same class as that, perhaps to all intents and purposes identical with it; and if you take the analogy of the</page><page sequence="14">I26 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. familiar fact as your guide, you will be able to explain much that would otherwise remain mysterious." Thus it can give us some conception of what happens when sound and light travel, by pointing to the familiar fact of wave motion in water, and telling us that their motion is wave motion also. In the case of the dew, we have not far to seek for the familiar phenomenon. The conversion of vapor into water when we breathe on glass, or other similar facts, suggests the hypothesis that vapor is deposited from the air when the bedewed substance is colder than air. What do we do with the hypothesis? We proceed provisionally to treat it as an established truth and to deduce its consequences. When Mill comes to treat of Deduction, he tells us rightly that it sepa- rates itself into three stages, an Induction, a Ratiocination, and a Verification. The same thing is true of all reasoning. The first process is the induction, in other words, the hypothe- sis, the guess as to how the fact of which we have a fragment before us would, if we had it as a whole, really appear. Hitting on hypotheses that turn out right is the prerogative of genius. For the rest of the process, it is mainly care and industry that are required. In the present case, however, the application of previous knowledge left little choice but the hypothesis described. Having got our hypothesis, we next deduce from it some individual consequence (the ratiocination), and ascer- tain whether it accords with fact (the verification). The ratiocination in the present case would be, that some particular bedewed plate will be found to be colder than the air at a little distance from it. We try it. It comes out right. We find then that our theory has enabled us to explain a fact, or to make a prediction, as we choose to view it. The explanation of a fact is always, from another point of view, equivalent to the making of a prediction. If a theory enables us to make enough of such explanations and predictions as to eliminate chance, and if one never turns out wrong, then we say that it is a true theory. We have indeed in numberless instances no other criterion of its truth but this. We cannot submit such facts as the deposition of dew, or the wave motion of sound</page><page sequence="15">No. 2.] THE HUMIST DOCTRINE OF CAUSATION. I27 and light, to the direct evidence of sense; nor, unless we had an angel from heaven to converse with, to the evidence of testimony. We can only submit some of the consequences of such theories to sense, and test them. The account of rea- soning which Mill gives in his chapter on Deduction is, in the main, true of all reasoning. The doctrine of the Inductive Methods is, I think, an excrescence on his valuable work. The salient difference between the process that he looks upon as Induction and that which he looks upon as Deduction, is that in the first the theory may be regarded as established to begin with, and we may take its consequences as certain beforehand, while in the second, the theory is a guess, which may be confirmed, if whatever we predict by it, or explain from it, turns out right. No hard and fast line, however, can be drawn between the two. All theories, at one stage of their history, have occupied an intermediate position. They have enabled predictions to be made with some confidence, and have themselves been confirmed when these predictions turned out true. The above considerations are sufficient, I think, to make it clear that Mill's metaphysical theory, that causation is reducible to the mere constant conjunction of events, was a source of nothing but confusion to him in his logical teaching. A class of considerations that place in a strong light its inadequacy to explain the facts that it professes to explain, are those connected with that description of causation that in the Aris- totelian system is known as the causa materials. In his criticism of Hamilton's theory, Mill, no doubt, hardly goes too far in describing the latter's anmazing fancy that causation in- volves an innate belief in the indestructibility of matter, as little better than a mauvaise plaisanterie. He misses, on the other hand, the interesting point that Hamilton brings out, that, when we analyze our conception of cause and effect, we find that "owe think of the cause as containing all that is con- tained in the effect, the effect as containing nothing but what was contained in the cause." It is all very well for Mill to say that the cause that Hamilton refers to is Materia, and that</page><page sequence="16">I28 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. what all the rest of the world mean by a cause is Efficiens. But the rest of the world, both lay and philosophic, continually and naturally treat Materia as a cause quite equally with Efficiens. What, for example, to revert to an instance sug- gested above, can be more natural than to describe last night's rain as the cause of the floods in the rivers and of the pools of water in the streets to-day ? The significant element in causal conjunctions of this sort is that, not only do they give us pri- ority on the part of the cause and sequence on the part of the effect, but even after the effect is produced we continue to see the whole cause in it. Mill himself recognizes that the causal connection between the combination of oxygen and hydrogen and the phenomenon of water, is Transformation.' This is surely something very different from invariable conjunction, but the necessity of modifying the Humist canon in conformity with such a conclusion does not occur to him. It is in the perception of this underlying identity between the cause and the effect that the intelligibility of causation, in so far as it is intelligible, consists. Hume remarks, with regard to such a sequence as that between the length of the arm in the lever and the force that it enables us to exert, that we know nothing about it a priori, any more than we do about such a sequence as that between the ignition of powder and the consequent explosion. In that, of course, he is per- fectly right. The fancy that a priori knowledge, itself a contradiction in terms, has anything to do with self-evidence is a pure illusion. There is, however, it is obvious, a wide dis- tinction between the sequence in the case of the lever and in that of the spark and the gunpowder. We can, as we put it, understand the one, but not the other. We notice, too, this about the sequence in the case of the lever, that it is difficult even to state it as the conjunction of two facts. It presents itself as indissolubly one, and any separation we can make between its beginning and its ending is obviously purely arti- ficial. It is the case, of course, that in a lever of the first kind, an arm of a yard in length between us and the fulcrum, Logic, vol. I, p. 451.</page><page sequence="17">No. 2.] THE HUMIST DOCTRINE OF CA USA TION. 129 will give us greater power than an arm of a foot in length; but that is only a small part of the truth. The full truth would involve an expression of the quantitative concomitant variation between the length of the arm and the resulting power. Hence, in any practical instance of the use of the lever, we have not one conjunction of events presented to us, but an infinitude of conjunctions, crowded into each moment. We have a series without a break, and that is what conforms to our conception of a whole or a unity. At bottoom, not only is the unity of the fact a series, but the unity of the thing also consists in its being a series; though, in the latter case, it is further, as Kant observes, a reversible series. It thus happens that, in the case of the lever, our description of the cause, in- volving particulars as to the length of the arm, the force of the agent, the weight of the thing acted upon, and the fact of the exertion of the force, is a description also of the effect. A sequence of this sort is the ideal of causation. It is a case of causation which is all under our eyes, in which there is no gap left to fill up by inference. It is the only sort of causation that will correspond to Mill's conception of invariable uncon- ditional antecedence. His example of such antecedence 1 is the case of the presence of the sun, with his light not extinct and no opaque object between us and him, and daylight, an instance in which the same words that describe the cause describe the effect also. It is a self-subsistent whole, that suggests no further enquiry. The case of the spark and the explosion, on the contrary, is like the beginning and end of a sentence, with the middle left out. We have the two ends of the series, and a manifest hiatus between them. Such gaps it is the business of science to fill up. The interpolation of the missing links we regard as the explanation of the phenomenon presented. It brings us nearer to the perception of the fact as a whole, and thus we seem to approach a comprehension of it. With each link that is filled up, it must be observed that we reach a law of wider generality. Between the phenomenon of the beating of a drum and the sound that we hear, science 1 Logic, vol. I, p. 350.</page><page sequence="18">I 30 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. has interpolated the air wave; and not only is it the case that the connection between air waves and sound is a wider law than the connection between drum beats and sound, but the conception of wave motion as the cause of the sensation bf sound suggested it as the cause of the sensations of light and radiant heat also. Hence we seem always to be approaching the same goal by different roads. On the one hand, the per- ception of an analogy gives us the clue to fill up a missing link in the series that we call a fact; on the other, every missing link filled up involves an extension of our analogies, an apparent approach to an ever receding unity. The approximation to identity between cause and effect is something that admits of degrees. Suppose I paste some discs of white paper on a black surface; the result is piebald. It is hard to say whether 'Black and white is piebald' is more properly to be regarded as an identical proposition like ' Black is black,' or whether it is to be reckoned among the truths that we call empirical. If I move some distance off, the result is gray; or if I make the experiment with blue and yellow, the result is green. That the mixture of a blue pigment with a yellow one makes green, is beyond all question an empirical truth. It is not without surprise that most of us learn, in the first instance, that it does so.' Yet there are points at which it is hard to say whether the phenomenon presented is blue and yellow, or is green; and even when it is clear that it is green, we still continue to see the blue and yellow in the green, that is, the whole cause in the effect. The same thing is true of the blending of pressures in the parallelogram of forces. We have in such cases resemblance between cause and effect, and resemblance which is a clue to their identity. This very invariable conjunction that we hear so much about, what is it in truth ? There is never such a thing in the world of con- crete realities as the mere conjunction of two isolated facts. Not only does fire cause the sensation of heat, but the intensity 1 The continuity between simple and heteropathic causation is also seen in the case of sound, in the insensible transition from a series of noises to a musical note.</page><page sequence="19">No. 2.] THE NCUMIST DOCTRINE OF CAUSATION. 13I of the sensation is in proportion to the size or nearness of the fire, and varies as it varies. The concomitant variation between the number of vibrations and the pitch of musical notes is a familiar illustration of the same principle. Such concomitant variations are brought under the head of constant conjunction, by supposing them to be due to the repetition of some imagi- nary unit in the cause and in the effect at once. The notion is strained, as the unit is entirely fictitious; still it may be useful as assisting us to understand what this constant conjunction is, and in what its significance lies. The equivalent multiplication of the supposed unit would be what in mathematics we call proportion, and which is the very type of analogy. It seems that constant conjunction itself is therefore simply the most elementary form in which this all-pervading principle of -pro- portion, fitness, resemblance, and finally identity, between cause and effect, the very existence of which is denied, presents itself. Mill, like Hume, throughout treats any resemblance that makes itself apparent between causes and their effects as a mere source of illusion. This is due to his confining his atten- tion to examples of a very special character, drawn for the most part from chemistry. In practical enquiries some resem- blance between something in the cause and something in the effect, the track and the foot, the wound and the instrument that inflicted it, the substance on the instrument and human blood, is ordinarily all that gives us a clue to the solution of our problem. It is to be remarked, however, that mere resem- blance in itself warrants no inference. It is only resemblance, in as far as it indicates identity, that does so. How widely the rule holds good that resemblance is an indication of that sort of identity that warrants inference, is a fact that has been, in the main, overlooked by logicians. The known equality of two objects always imports that they have been made equal to each other. Their equality is a characteristic that necessarily has a history. Paint from one pot presents a resemblance, no matter what surface it covers, to other paint from the same pot, and a resemblance that may guide us to its origin. In organic life, Nature works by the same rule. Resemblance is</page><page sequence="20">132 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. there, if sufficiently essential, an infallible clue to origin. We have, in such a fact as this, one of that class of widely preva- lent laws which Aristotle, more than two thousand years ago, detected and named "imitations of first principles." ' Closely connected with it is the fact that the changes which one in- dividual subject undergoes are largely the equivalent of the differences between various individual subjects of the same class. So much so is this the case, that even so accurate a writer as Mill ordinarily confounds the two. His application of all his methods refers miscellaneously to changes that take place in individual objects, and to differences that exist between objects of the same class. We find a striking imitation on the part of Nature of the first principle last alluded to, in the fact that the development of the embryo is an epitome of the development of the race. The existence of such imitations of first principles helps to account for some of the marvellous guesses of philosophy. In England and France, the prevalent tendency is to slight the attention paid in Germany to matters of abstract thinking. We must not forget, however, that Leibnitz, with his law of the continuous gradation of created beings, anticipated by two hundred years the discovery of the evolution of species ; and, in his theory of causation, came very near to an anticipation of the discovery of the conservation of energy. The attention paid to first principles in Germany also brought it about that, fifty or a hundred years ago, historical questions were treated there, not only by Hegel, but long before his day by Lessing, in a manner in which we are only beginning to treat them now in England, in the light of Darwin's all-embracing theory. If we ask, moreover, whence it was that Carlyle drew his charac- teristic doctrine that nothing survives in the world but what deserves to survive, - a corollary, as one would think, from the law of the survival of the fittest, - the answer must be that it was assuredly not from any scientific source, in the narrower sense of that word. It had filtered down to him, through Goethe, from Spinoza and Leibnitz, and had its origin in the 1 Metaphysics, bk. I, ch. VI adfinem.</page><page sequence="21">No. 2.] THE HUM/ST DOCTRINE OF CAUSATION. 1 33 conception, common to these two great thinkers, of evil as something negative and necessarily self-destructive. If the causal relation consisted in nothing else but the con- stant conjunction of one physical fact with another, then, of course, the attempt to infer from physical facts a supersensible cause would be necessarily an illusion. As that view of the causal relation, however, though much in fashion at present, will not in any way square with what it has to explain, the attempt at such an inference is not, at any rate on that simple and obvious ground, at once out of court. Not only in practical enquiries, but in the enquiries of such sciences as geology and archaeology, we start from an effect only as our datum, and endeavor, from what we can discover as to the nature of this effect, to reconstruct the whole of which it is a fragment. A phenomenon that presents a manifest adaptation of means to ends, while what or who brought about this adap- tation remains unknown, will always be for us a fragment that suggests the necessity for some explanation. It is easy to label the inference, that such instances of adaptation must be the work of some mind more or less analogous to the human mind, as I anthropomorphism'; and thus think that we are done with it; but who will tell us where legitimate inference ends, and where this anthropomorphism begins ? There is a sense in which it is anthropomorphism for me to infer that the feel- ings of another are like my own from the similarity of their outward expression; but this anthropomorphism is not an illusion. At what point does it begin to be one ? How far may we legitimately press the inference of purpose as mani- fested in human works to the inference of purpose as manifested in Nature ? That is the main theme of Kant's great work. Unfortunately any one can find there any answer which he desires to find. Huxley and Lilly can quote Kant with equal approval, and, for that very reason, with equal futility. His conception of the universe of sense and thought is one of several universes separated by impassable chasms. One chasm divides the things of sense from the things of intelligence; another, the truths of speculation from the truths</page><page sequence="22">134 THE PHILOSOPHICAL RE VIEW. of practice. Hence, the existence of God may be true from the practical point of view, but untrue from the speculative, so that we are left no wiser than we were before. The concep- tion of the existence of any such abysses between one class and another of the facts of Nature and Mind, is a misleading one. There is, on the contrary, a perfect solidarity discoverable between them all, between our most rudimentary localization of a sensation, and our insight into the deepest law of physics or of thought. It took mankind many ages to evolve the concep- tion of Mind as the cause of the order and beauty observable in the universe, and to get rid of "the vain theories of the earlier ages." ' It may take them many ages more to so modify the conception as to bring it into harmony with their ever widening knowledge. It seems hardly possible to believe, however, that, once discovered, such a conception will ever be altogether cast aside or lost to the world. It may be that the belief in Mind as somehow immanent in Nature, is destined to be the belief of the future; but if it is, such immanence will still unquestionably have to be reconciled with the fact of a forethought that has planned the processes in which it is immanent.
