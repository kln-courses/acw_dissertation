<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTERVIEW Puppet Theatre: identity of place Dadi D. Pudumjee and Jennifer Pfeiffer m dialogue with Geeti Sen Geeti Sen: I would like to welcome Jennifer to India. And we are very glad to have Dadi Pudumjee back at the IIC! The issues here really concern the outreach of global culture versus the survival of regional and traditional forms of puppetry. The question is whether the same lan guage, the same discourses are being spoken everywhere in East and South Asia; and how is this accepted in the Western world. Dadi, how do you feel about the preservation of traditional pup pet theatre? Dadi Pudumjee: Preservation has been an ongoing process for years. When I look back over the last 20 to 24 years in Delhi, tradi tional puppetry has changed. The word preservation is some times misunderstood because we don't necessarily want mu seum pieces; if it is to be living culture, it should be changing— and it has. It is only in the last ten or 15 years that there have been drastic changes due to various exposures and reasons. Au diences and techniques have changed tremendously in many ways—good or bad, I cannot say. I don't believe that any per formance art is static: any artiste, group or individual, brings something to his or her art form—it should be that way. The puppeteers, after all, do want to change to attract new audi ences. But what and how to change is not really easy for tradi tional puppeteers. GS: Would you say that puppetry is an art that is losing out to other forms of art performance?</page><page sequence="2">86 / India International Centre Quarterly DP: Puppetry has long been rated a second or third art form be cause dance, music and theatre have been encouraged and ex posed. It is important to mention here the concentrated efforts of Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya who started an art and folk art revival, specially puppetry. This led to many people who had worked with her or who were influenced by her to research and organise thematic festivals and puppet workshops. GS: Some of these were hosted right here at the IIC. The awareness that Kamaladeviji had created happened perhaps at a critical stage—when something needed to be done. Here I used the word preservation as opposed to revival. Each word is so double-edged; this is what they are all talking about—the language of discourse. DP: Again, it is how we perceive it. My work with traditional pup pet theatre is one on one; it is more practical, and through inter actions. It is difficult to assess what a traditional puppeteer liv ing in a remote area would feel; but most of the groups that I have come across have a strong pride in tradition. But as you probe a little deeper, you discover that they are changing. They want change but they are not sure how or in what direction because their life has been family traditions, oral traditions. GS: Is there somebody really outstanding now in traditional puppet thea tre whom you feel is worth following as he or she changes? DP: There are a few: those who have introduced production values, possibly in the length of the repertoire, or the story. Most artistes have a sense of knowing for which audience they are perform ing. We advise them to retain their culture and tradition, and experiment within that. These are the groups that have an au dience today: the Yakshagana Gombeyatta Group, of Bhaskar Koga Kamath, son of the late Koga Kamath; Ramachandra Pullavar, son of the late Krishnakuti Pullavar, who runs their Tolpava Kuthu shadow puppet group in Kerala; Puran Bhatt in Delhi, who has had both an exposure to modern puppet thea tre, and is a master at Rajasthani puppetry. These are some of the few lucky ones invited to festivals. GS: Supposing you are not patronised, not brought to Delhi nor to festi vals abroad. Can you survive? If you are in Orissa or Kerala and you</page><page sequence="3">Dadi D. Pudumjee and Jennifer Pfeiffer / 87 don't have access to the capital, can you survive anyway? Do you have a local audience? DP: For traditional puppetry, local audiences are more substantial than your capital city audience. Each of these groups come from different states, regions, languages, dialects, art forms; and you realise that it really is a country where there is so much diver sity when you travel. Even in a country like China, where you will see some affinities, there is not that much of diversity. That is what makes Indian puppet theatre interesting, what makes us special. Audiences have waned in certain areas because of new media, and other exposures. The puppeteer now needs to win the audiences back—changing, without changing—it is up to them. Jennifer Pfeiffer: It was explained to me by the Rajasthani string pup peteers that a lot of the traditional practices are closely con nected to life, the people and the communities. So just stepping back from that and thinking on a bigger scale, it is clear that when societies and communities change through processes like globalisation, that puts tradition in a very vulnerable situation. GS: You were speaking about vulnerability...I just wonder, Jennifer, if you would compare this to other parts of Asia. Would you care to do that? JP: The Japanese people can be very innovative; their's is a culture that is fairly dynamic, encouraging quite avant garde practi tioners. But their traditional puppetry form, Bunraku, persists unchanged. It has just been named a national treasure in the UNESCO intangible cultural heritage listings. Research enables a broader knowledge of the traditions beyond their source coun try. It may not, however, inform the broader public of the present difficulties for traditional puppeteers. GS: Speaking of improvisation, I believe that the whole nature of perform ance is that it is not alive unless it is improvised to some extent. It is like the old bardic, or the old katha traditions: they have a tremendous memory bank; but the individual stamp must be there, even in a tra ditional performance. It was just wonderful to see how, at the IIC Festival of Arts, Dadi brought in the old traditional story from India, which moved on</page><page sequence="4">Transposition The Ishara Puppet Theatre Trust Photo: Dadi D. Pudumjee</page><page sequence="5">Dadi D. Pudumjee and Jennifer Pfeiffer / 89 to Thomas Mann's The Transposed Heads and then was taken up by Girish Karnad. You were also influenced by Rashna Gandhy Imhasly's interpretation of the double persona. So you took a traditional form but you introduced your large puppets, which are completely overpowering. The most mesmerising image for me was the image of Kali dancing...Kali let loose with her hair. I would say that it was almost a kind of anti-icon in a way; but it was so powerful. Suppose you were to do this presentation, Dadi, in a small part of Bengal, how would people react to it, and would they take offence? How do we deal with the issue of urban audiences as opposed to the original—local—audiences for which this form of performance was originally intended? On the one hand you would like puppetry to achieve the same status as the other performing arts; but on the other hand, by doing that, you are talking to an audience which speaks in different voices... So you adapt to those voices or that language of discourse. Therefore, you are changing; but is that good? DP: There has to be openness. All of us must grow, or grow out of certain things; you develop as you grow, you assimilate and absorb as you grow and change. In the last 15 to 20 years mod ern puppeteers have come together with traditional puppet eers in these new platforms, which wasn't the case earlier. In 1978 in Bangalore, there was a big shadow puppets' festival where, for the first time, some of the shadow puppeteers them selves said that they didn't know that there was another tradi tional shadow style in a neighbouring state! This coming to gether was special; but successive festivals have also created problems because we started borrowing from each other! As similation is sure to happen; but then, what and how much is important without losing one's identity. For instance, at the Ishara International Puppet Festival in January 2005, when the rod puppeteers from Bengal performed at the Habitat Centre to a rather large Bengali audience, not many appreciated the show. Though they were very good they didn't realise that this was a different audience. One way to assess a performance if you don't understand the language is based on the visual aspect. There were other people there who could understand the language but sometimes found it a bit obnoxious. So it is never possible to perform for everyone—</page><page sequence="6">90 / India International Centre Quarterly there are different audiences and each group will pick out a certain thing. Let's face it: whatever you say, in the end it is the commer cial film that is the most powerful medium right now. GS: Is there any cinematic influence that comes in, or any other influ ence? DP: A lot. Most influences in traditional puppet theatres in Asia are not isolated; they are always linked with the traditional theatre forms, dance, the plastic arts. When one or the other gets weak or disappears, then the stronger existing form which is, in this case, possibly film in India, takes over. Puppeteers will borrow freely from film: the colours, music, even names in certain tra ditional puppet performances, to try and titillate the audience. GS: There is a total divide, for instance, between the films that are being done today which are totally urban, and earlier films. In films such as Do Bigha Zameen, perhaps Pather Panchali, we saw a more sensi tive portrayal, though there still was a divide; or in Mother India, there was Bollywood looking at the village, with a very sensitive ren dering. Today, the divide has grown... This is where puppet theatre steps in—where it can significantly contribute. You know you have to bridge that divide. DP: But a collaborative process of bridging the gap will have to come from both sides. Otherwise, if it is from one side then it be comes urban oriented; it becomes financial power or the poli tics of grant giving. GS: Let's examine the question of survival and change...How many mod ern puppeteers are there, for example, in Australia, where there is no long puppetry tradition? It is all modern puppetry; and yet borrow ing from some tradition. JP: Australia is a relatively young country in terms of our pup petry practices, and all our influences have come from else where. We are in a process of discovering or inventing tradi tions for ourselves that are hybrids of all our influences... We have always had to be great innovators and improvisers. That</page><page sequence="7">Dadi D. Pudumjee and Jennifer Pfeiffer / 91 has given us a certain amount of freedom because we are not burdened by tradition, not constrained by it. GS: Is there puppet theatre in Australia that relates to issues of the day? Does it follow a political line, a discourse? JP: Punch and Judy, with cultural roots that go to Europe and Eng land, originally was a very immediate form that responded to everyday concerns. It was for the people, and provided a cri tique or parody of power structures that existed in the towns. There has even been a resurgence for it recently, although in some quarters it is seen as politically incorrect because of its violence. There is some fabulous work coming from companies in Australia. Snuff Puppets, a Melbourne company, recently fin ished a collaboration with an aboriginal community. It is a col lection of stories about mythological creatures that still have significance to our indigenous communities. They relate an abo riginal sense of history: of the land, the people and the spirit creatures that inhabit it. They have generated the aboriginal sensibility that 'history is place'; and they convey it clearly and quite wonderfully. GS: That is what puppetry should be about, as distinguished from other theatre...It provides the identity of a sense of place! If it could do that, then this transcends this problem that you face about going global... You can still change, you can still adapt, you can still innovate—if you can assert that identity of place. DP: Identity is crucial; some sort of identity of where you come from, whether it is traditional, or modern or kitsch; the fear also that when you are talking about globalisation, that you are not go ing to be able to avoid it. Thirty years ago some of us went out to get certain things; today those very things are available at your doorstep, we take them for granted. Besides, television and film are thrust on you. Most young people today are influ enced by it, yet you cannot criticise development...whether you like it or not it exists. Yet there has to be a way of getting people to see what you are doing which may not be the style or trend</page><page sequence="8">Decote Choreographed by Sudesh Adhana and Dadi D.

Pudumjee</page><page sequence="9">Dadi D. Pudumjee and Jennifer Pfeiffer / 93 but still exists and has tremendous value. We do not necessar ily all speak the same language here; we don't have to! GS: Do you take traditional forms into your performances? DP: In the early '80s my first work in Delhi with Sutradhar puppet theatre was a mix of traditional artistes and modern perform ers. The story was in the Ramayana tradition—but the way we worked and presented it married the traditional and modern. There was a conscious synthesis between the traditional and modern; and the epitome of this was our production of Dhola Maru. Rajasthani puppeteers narrated the whole performance from the old tradition; and then flowed seamlessly into new work with large masks and with puppets... taking us back into Rajasthani tradition. GS: Dadi, when did you introduce masks? The idea of the mask with the slow, very slow movements leaves a tremendous impression. It was very powerful to see; and the hugeness, the scale of those hands, for example, that you have used in the presentation at the Jahan-e-Khusrau Festival. The scale is wonderful! These are the most important aspects of theatre: the gesture and the face. By masking the face, the body has to be much more active, enact bhava without the face. DP: Masks have always been there. The influence of the work I am doing now comes from my teachers Michael Meschhe in Swe den and the late Meher Contractor in Ahmedabad; and then a short workshop with the master of Bunraku, Yoshida Minoske, from Japan. A lot of these new works were influenced and came from collaborations... Thanato Morphia "The Many Faces of Death" with the modern dancer Astad Deboo, in the early '90s, which stressed on puppets and dance. Earlier it was story and text, the first Safdar Hashmi festival; Randhir Khare's poem "Failed to be Human" gave birth to the show, Allegory. Some times I feel the need to come back to the narrative—narrative as in words and text—not just movement and music. You see, one changes as one grows. GS: How does this compare, Jennifer, with other puppet theatre? We are examining the question of the narrative.</page><page sequence="10">94 / India International Centre Quarterly JP: The importance of the word and the narrative depends on whether you view post-modernism as a set of techniques or an historical era, or as an epic theoretical construct. But I think people are versed, spectators and performers, with multi-genre and cross-disciplinary forms more than they were twenty, or thirty years ago. A lot of people move into puppetry from other disciplines like dance and theatre; so it often depends upon one's background, whether the attraction is to the vocabulary of the body or to the poetics of the word. I don't think they are mutually exclusive and feel there is a poetics and language of the body as well. In the '80s, an innovative Australian company called Handspan really changed the map for Australian puppetry— because they shifted many conceits about what we had under stood puppetry to be. They showed the way, conveying com plex ideas and philosophy, combining elegant adaptations of text with numerous theatrical styles. Their influences were partly European with the Black Theatre of Prague; also Japa nese Bunraku; and another category known as Object Theatre. In Australia, for a while it became quite the fashion to not call one's theatre 'puppetry theatre' anymore, but rather 'visual thea tre', a term derived from Object Theatre; and that gradually came to refer to more conventional types of puppetry. GS: Explain this to us, who do not know about Object Theatre. JP: Object Theatre refers to not the animating of a human or an animal figure that is anthropomorphic, but rather to a series of images and transitions that show a sequence; episodic frames that in their theme tell, or suggest, the narrative. From what I have seen of Dadi's work, it moves towards that kind of repre sentational symbolism. These forms resonate for me—the more hybrid and innovative, the better! GS: I believe that Australia has taken the lead in collaboration in many art forms. It is a question of who is going to be your patron; this is the main problem about cross-cultural collaboration. JP: The idea of collaboration is very attractive; I was interested in specialising in cross-cultural work as early as 1994, during my</page><page sequence="11">Dadi D. Pudumjee and Jennifer Pfeiffer / 95 first cross-cultural collaboration with Japanese dancers. It was an interesting process, and I emphasise that word, 'process'. In reference to traditional forms and their development, collabo rations are one possible way of moving forward. It is a process that really needs careful consideration, and for a start it will have to be something that people from both countries and cul tures want. Even if you are not thinking of collaboration, support, pa tronage and funding is always a challenge. GS: You made a point earlier that Australia has a brief history, a historical memory, if you like—unless you go to the indigenous myths. In that case, you do look for collaboration and that is why the Asia Pacific became so important, after ignoring it for many, many years. JP: I think it would be a mistake to assume that we look to the traditions and Asia for collaboration because we are imagina tively bankrupt. It is not a matter of ignoring Asia, but realising that we are an Asian country Australians often have difficulty with identity because... GS: Are they coming to terms with this, of reaching out to Asia? JP: We are quite a uniquely multicultural country, and becoming more so all the time. I think that is one of our great strengths. Asia has had a significant influence in this direction; and we have many well-established Asian communities in our midst, both retaining an Asian identity and embracing 'Australian ness', whatever that is. I think we have difficulty naming this identity. The post-colonial Australia of the present has a short history that potentially raises problems with the whole ques tion of: who are we actually? Reconciliation with indigenous Australia is important and we move towards it, although, some of us feel, somewhat slowly. But life is richer because of our diverse cultural influences. GS: What about funding agencies. Do you go to UNESCO? JP: I work for UNIMA which is the international puppetry organi sation and is an NGO of UNESCO. UNESCO tends to prioritise programmes for developing countries and their support is not</page><page sequence="12">Sangeet Natak Akademi Festival, Putul Yatra, 2005 Choreographed by Dadi D. Pudumjee Photo: Dadi D. Pudumjee</page><page sequence="13">Dadi D. Pudumjee and Jennifer Pfeiffer / 97 usually financial. They fund some programmes, but for specifi cally targeted areas such as health, AIDS awareness and such like. They offer support in other ways; in networking, and in formation exchange. In Australia the arts have a Federal body and a number of state bodies for support, along with philan thropic trusts. International activity is supported. GS: Is there some sort of message, whether it is a personalised message or a traditional message? DP: It happens in various ways, with a city audience, or your pup peteer in rural areas, the traditional groups. City people look at the rural traditions through their spectacled eyes, through their prisms...this is bound to happen. This is truer of India than other countries because of this baggage, of feudalism and colonial ism, or because traditional forms still exist in their traditional ways. GS: Dadi, I would like to conclude by asking who has contributed signifi cantly to puppet theatre in India. Despite the scope and the richness, how much support does it receive from the government here? DP: It could get more; it should get much more! While there is an awareness, the problem is that it is not easy for most of the traditional, non-urban Indian puppeteers to apply for funding and to fill forms, deal with bureaucracy. At the first thematic festivals at the Sangeet Natak Akademi (SNA) for string pup pets in Udaipur, one of the officials promised funding; but she asked the puppeteers what they would do with it if they had it! There was no immediate answer; but these answers have to come from the people themselves, the puppeteers. Are they going to have training? Are they willing to train other people? Earlier, the practice was more family oriented; today they are more willing to train outsiders. What is the way forward? Just money for preservation, or keeping it alive with innovations? We must experiment and innovate... In a workshop organised by the NFSC, National Folklore Support Centre in Chennai, Ramchandra Pullavar, the shadow puppeteer from Kerala, and Chidambara Rao, a shadow pup peteer from Andhra are currently in collaboration: to create new</page><page sequence="14">Gatha Dhola Maru Designed and directed by Dadi D.

Pudumjee and Jennifer Pfeiffer / 99 puppets in their own style, or a new story. Another puppeteer, Ajit Ayancheri from Kerala, a modern puppeteer, is helping to co-ordinate it. They are talking of an indigenous story, which has the advantage of having some base, something to fall back on, the storyline, the visual—whatever—something already there, and not taken from outside. Puran Bhatt worked with a French puppeteer on a col laboration—it was between two love stories: The Little Mermaid and Dhola Maru. The mermaid becomes Maru and Maru be comes the mermaid—it was a transposition. It worked to some extent, but it became exotic for the foreigner; for many of our Indian audiences, it was different, it was one love story trans posed by another. This concept needs some more thought... It is not just the idea of making nice puppets and working together. Eventually, your responsibility is to your audiences as well; being true to yourself and your audience. Whatever arts you practise, you are saying something through your cho sen medium.</page></plain_text>
