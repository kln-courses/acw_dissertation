(Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana, Quito, Ecua- dor). Washington, D.C. (?): Organization of American States and Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments, 1978, unnumbered pp., photos, bibliography. This review examines the third in a sequence of catalogues that have been written since 1961 describing the acclaimed Traversari Collec- tion of musical instruments, housed in the Casa de la Cultura Ecua- toriana, Quito. Cognizant of the unique character of the Collection, Casa Museum administrators have sought continuous improvements in the accounting of the Collection's contents. The first catalogue of the Traversari Collection, Catdlogo General del Museo de Instrumentos Musicales, appeared in 1961. Although it is anonymous, we are told by Sr. Vicente Mena, director of los Museos de la Casa de la Cultura, and by Sr. Carlos Coba, ethnomu- sicologist-folklorist at the Instituto Otavalefio de Antropologia, that Pedro Pablo Traversari Salazar himself wrote it. This initial catalogue contains a nine-page overview of the historical background and con- tents of the Collection, followed by a nine-page "Catalogo," which presents a listing of numbers of instruments and other material in broad subcategories within ten larger secciones: Instrumentos Prehis- t6ricos; Instrumentos Indigenas de Varias Zonas; Instrumentos Coreo- graficos; Instrumentos de Civilizaciones Antiguas; Instrumentos de Viento; Instrumentos de Percusi6n; Instrumentos Punteados y de Teclado; Instrumentos Mecanicos y de Fuelle; Instrumentos de Cuerda; Pinoteca y Bibliografla Musicales. Next, a twenty-two-page section cites opinions of various visitors to the Collection, and an equal number of facing pages contain black-and-white photographs of various groups of Traversari instruments. From these photographs, and particularly from the overall view photograph on page 72, one can see both the diversity of the Collection and the manner in which the instruments were displayed prior to 1960. The 1971 catalogue is entitled Museo de Instrumentos Musicales</page><page sequence="2">266 : Reviews "Pedro Pablo Traversari." Ines Jij6n, then head of the Casa Secci6n de Artes Musicales and presently professor of piano at the Quito Conservatory, authored the historical prefatory outline, and she coor- dinated the contributions of fourteen collaborators on the catalogue. Its sixty pages contain 252 numbered items, each described variously as to material, provenance, function, etymology, and/or historical usage. Classificatory irregularities occur; for instance, under the major category "Instrumentos Musicales de America," "Quenas" is listed as one subcategory-and later "Instrumentos de Viento" appears as another subcategory. Rephann's Catalogue is the third attempt to catalogue the Tra- versari Collection. The author's preface, originally dated 1976 in the manuscript copy of the 1978 Catalogue, first summarizes more detailed but still sketchy historical data on the life of Chilean-educated Pedro Traversari Salazar and on that of his father, a renowned native Italian musician, contained in Jijon's preface to the 1971 catalogue. That earlier preface refers to Traversari Salazar's musicological inves- tigations in the following terms: "El maestro Traversari, no perdi6 ocasi6n de recorrer los campos de la Republica de Chile, otros paises de America y Europa, con el exclusivo objeto de coleccionar instru- mentos musicales indigenas originales, anotar sus aires y canciones, y recoger datos para la historia en todas las manifestaciones artisticas" (Jij6n: 4). Rephann adds the important datum that Traversari Salazar compiled the results of this research in a 1902 unpublished manuscript, El Arte en America (or, Historia del Arte Musical Indigena y Popular). After noting that records of instrument prov- enance of the Traversari Collection are nearly totally lacking, Rephann comments on the provenance of certain European instru- ments in the Collection, instruments obtained by Traversari in a January 1, 1907, exchange with Evan Gorga, an instrument collector of Rome. On behalf of Ecuador, the Quito Casa de la Cultura ob- tained the Traversari Collection on May 1, 1951, and its founder- vendor Traversari Salazar was retained as director of the Museum- Collection. Rephann states that the Catalogue utilizes the Hornbostel-Sachs system (Erich M. von Hornbostel and Curt Sachs, "Systematik der Musikinstrumente. Ein Versuch." Zeitschrift fiir Ethnologie, Jahrg., 1914, Heft 4 u. 5, Berlin, 1914. Trans. by Anthony Baines and Klaus P. Wachsmann, Galpin Society Journal, no. 14, March, 1961, p. 26) "as modified by the Comite International des Musees et Collections des Instruments de Musique" (1978: preface). Archaeological exem-</page><page sequence="3">Reviews : 267 plars are further subclassified morphologically. Carlos Coba, one of the fourteen collaborators on the 1971 catalogue, told this writer that he had suggested to Jij6n that the Hornbostel-Sachs system be uti- lized for the 1971 catalogue and that his suggestion had been rejected by Jij6n, who, he alleges, had stated that that system was "muy complicado." A quote presumably (n.d.) from a 1950 article in La Nacion of Guayaquil, cited by Jij6n, mentions that the Traversari Collection had "mas de 2,000 piezas de arte musical" (Jijon: 6). Rephann suggests that, prior to his 1974 cataloguing of the instruments in the Collection, no accurate inventory existed; as a result, he discounts an early estimate of 4,000 instruments (by an unnamed source), an estimate that, he alleges, counted Jivaro quivers and arrows as instru- ments. Coba, who may or may not have examined the entire Collec- tion in detail, in response to my question about the number of instru- ments, said that there were (c. 1970) "700-800 unidades clasificables." Rephann concludes: "In 1974, I catalogued all of the musical instru- ments in La Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana; there were fewer than nine hundred items" (1978: preface). Coba recently commented that he believed Rephann had rejected certain instruments in the Collection, choosing not to catalogue them; Coba did not know why this might have occurred. Whereas the 1971 catalogue allots nearly equal space to its listings of American and European/Asian instruments, suggesting a roughly equal representation from both areas, Rephann, in accord with the opinion of Traversari Salazar himself (Traversari Salazar: 9), insists that the Collection's "strength is clearly indigenous South American instruments" (1978: preface), despite the presence of certain fine European exemplars. The Rephann preface is followed by its Spanish translation. After this "Prefacio," then, in this unpaginated Catalogue, is a six-page Spanish condensation, "Clasificaci6n de Instrumentos," of the four Hornbostel-Sachs categories: Idi6fonos; Membran6fonos; Aer6fonos; Cord6fonos. (The actual Hornbostel-Sachs categories, as presented in their complete, Sachs-authorized Spanish translation by Carlos Vega, are in the order: Idiofonos; Membran6fonos; Cor- d6fonos; Aerofonos.) Each of the "Clasificaci6n" major categories and each subcategory is defined, but the Rephann "Clasificaci6n" definitions differ from the Hornbostel-Sachs/Vega definitions. Al- though the preface and the actual Catalogue body are bilingual, each consecutively numbered instrument in the body being identified in</page><page sequence="4">268 : Reviews both English (left column) and Spanish (right column), this initial "Clasificaci6n" is not offered also in English as would have been expected. One point of confusion is that the four-digit numbers nonhier- archically listed in the "Clasificaci6n" do not correspond to the decimal subcategories of the Hornbostel-Sachs system, as the reader might be tempted at first to suppose; rather, these numbers correspond to actual individual, consecutively numbered instrument exemplars of the Collection, as becomes obvious from the subsequent Catalogue body itself. The manuscript copy of the 1978 Catalogue does state "Numeros del catalogo" above the "Clasificaci6n" numbers; unfor- tunately, this identifying marker was omitted from the final printed version. To conclude, the individual instruments summarily described in the body of the Catalogue are not each categorized into a specific Hornbostel-Sachs decimal number; rather, each instrument's number corresponds to a general Hornbostel-Sachs subcategory (within Aer6fonos, Cord6fonos, etc.) as described in the "Clasificaci6n." The 1978 Catalogue, then, aims at general rather than at precise cate- gorization of the Traversari instruments. Another confusing aspect of the "Clasificaci6n" is that, once the reader has realized that the "Clasificaci6n" numbers correspond to specific exemplars in this collection, he/she is tempted to believe that, likewise, the subcategorical descriptions of the "Clasificaci6n" also are geared to this particular collection. But this assumption would be false: although Rephann does not make the following conclusion sufficiently explicit, it appears the "Clasificaci6n" is a modified Hornbostel-Sachs standard classification that could be used to intro- duce a catalogue of any instrument collection. For example, from the "Clasificaci6n," 4122-4136: "1. Citaras punteadas: Este grupo incluye todas las citaras empleadas en la ejecuci6n de muisica folklorica de Francia, Suiza, Austria, Hungria, los Paises Escandinavos, asi como tambien el virginal, la espineta, el clavecin." Yet the zithers (citaras) described in the body of the Catalogue under the numbers from 4122 to 4136 include also zithers and psalteries allegedly from Germany, Spain, Italy, and Ecuador. Thus the "Clasificacion" is at once scientific (thus precise) in stated aim (preface) and quasi- scientific (general subcategories) in actual presentation, at once geared to the Traversari Collection (by enumeration) and not geared to the Traversari Collection (standard character of "Clasificaci6n" descriptions).</page><page sequence="5">Reviews : 269 The one obvious error in the body of the Rephann Catalogue occurs in the Chordophone category (4000- ). Here the four-digit numbers proceed consecutively through 4014. Thereafter, an enu- meration error appears to have occurred. The final instrument entry within the Clasificaci6n subcategory "Laudes largos, 1. Punteados" (Long Lutes, 1. Plucked), 4014, is followed in the Catalogue body not by 4015, which should be the first entry within "Laudes largos, 2. Tocados con arco" (Long Lutes, 2. Bowed). Instead, 4014 is fol- lowed by 4091, 4092, 4093, etcetera. To further the confusion, 4091, which, according to the "Clasificaci6n," corresponds to the first entry within "Laudes cortos, 1. Punteados" (Short Lutes, 1. Plucked), is in the Catalogue immediately preceded by the terse identifying marker "Bowed-Tocados con arco." Then 4095, the last entry within "Laudes cortos, 1. Punteados" according to the "Clasificaci6n," is followed in the body by the new major entry, "Short Lutes/Plucked- Laudes Cortos/Punteados." This lengthy series of a Yiieh ch'in, an 'Ud, mandolins, a mandocello, charangos, bandolas, lyre-guitars, a tiple, and guitarrones, ending with 4090, is immediately followed by "Bowed-Tocados con arco," numbers 4096-4121; this section de- scribes a pochette, a kit, rabels, violins, a mute violin, a viola d'amore, a philomele, violas, violoncellos, double-basses, and a hurdy- gurdy. The basis of this apparently complex error lies in a misenu- meration in the "Clasificacion." The "Clasificacion lists 4015-4090 as "Laudes largos, 2. tocados con arco." It would appear from Re- phann's descriptions in the Catalogue body that the "Clasificaci6n" enumeration for this subsection should be, instead of 4015-4090, 4015-4019, since he describes in the body five instruments that would correspond to that subsection: two North African Kamange a giz, one Egyptian Rebdb el-mughanni, one Chinese Tan ch'in, and one Chinese Prh hu. Thus, the Catalogue body subtitle for 4091-4095, "Bowed-Tocados con arco" is correct; only the enumeration is faulty. It should have been 4015-4019. The next "Clasificacion" subsection, "Laudes cortos, 1. Punteados," should not have the printed enumeration 4091-4095 but rather the enumeration 4020-4095. Accordingly, the Catalogue body enumera- tion under the sequentially correct title "Short Lutes/Plucked-Laudes Cortos/Punteados" should not be 4015-4090 but rather 4020-4095 to correspond with a corrected "Clasificacion" enumeration. The final lute "Clasificaci6n" subsection, "Laudes cortos, 2. Tocados con arco," bears correct enumeration, 4096-4121; this enumeration also</page><page sequence="6">270 : Reviews is correct in the Catalogue body. In sum, a small enumeration error in both "Clasificaci6n" and body causes considerable confusion for the Catalogue user. The Spanish translations of Rephann's individual instrument descriptions are not always limited to Rephann's data but may add data not in Rephann's English version. The English description of Catalogue item 4091, a North African Kamdnge a guz, reads: "2 strings. Skin top glued to coconut shell resonator. Forged metal spike with wood neck. Anonymous . . ." The Spanish translation of this item reads: "2 cuerdas. Tapa de cuero pegada a una cascara de coco. Esta hace las veces de caja de resonancia. El instrumento esta perforado por una barra de hierro. Dicha barra se apoya en el suelo para ser tocado. Mango de madera. Anonimo . . ." (my italics). The italicized Spanish statement adds performance information that should also have been included in the English description but was not. These minor criticisms detract only fractionally from what is a clear, beautifully presented, carefully prepared catalogue. Thirty- one smaller black-and-white photographs and five full-page color plates are each carefully focused, properly exposed, neatly cropped, and identified by Catalogue number. For some reason, the Mem- branophone category, of which the Traversari Collection has the fewest exemplars of any of the four Hornbostel-Sachs categories, has only one photo, of an ensemble of three sierra males, two playing transverse flutes, one a small bombo. One or more photos of indi- vidual Traversari membranophones would have been more in keeping with the other excellent Catalogue photos and organologically more valuable. The presence of Andean harps in the Traversari Collection is attested by the photograph on p. 64 of the 1961 catalogue, in which five harps are displayed. In the photographs on p. 33 and rear cover of the 1971 catalogue, two harps are shown. Rephann describes nine harps, one harp-lyre. Of these instruments, four are described as having arched bellies and three soundholes; of these four, one is given the provenance "Andean. 18th c.," the other three "Andean. 19th c." Two have thirty-two, two have thirty-three strings. These and other configurational and dimensional statistics relating to number of ribs, overall length, distance from belly to farthest point of back, vibrating length of strings, length of body, and width of body corre- spond closely to those statistics of the harp used in 1980 by the Cotacachi area indigenous community, suggesting that this instru-</page><page sequence="7">Reviews : 271 ment's physical and sonoral character has remained nearly constant for at least 100 years and perhaps for even 250 years. For recorders, flutes, flageolets, and clarinets, each joint is measured to the tenth of a centimeter. European aerophones are identified by maker, stamp, country and century. Membranophones are described as to method of fastening head(s). Historical data is provided when available; exemplar 3057, a bone quena, is described as having been removed from a Cafiari tomb in Azuay Province during an excavation directed by Dr. Paul Rivet. Director of the Yale Collection of Musical Instruments, Rephann freely expresses his subjective appraisals: 3054, a pre-Columbian quena: "Carefully made, deftly- executed fingerholes"; 3198, a twentieth-century duct flute: "Good workmanship"; 3450, an eighteenth-century Italian oboe: "An excep- tionally well-proportioned design"; 4113, a nineteenth-century Ecuadorian viola: "Numerous poor repairs. Poor condition." A list of nine bows ("Accessories") is appended to the 1978 Catalogue body. The concluding bibliography blatantly omits the 1914 Hornbostel-Sachs paper, the 1971 Jij6n catalogue, and the 1961 Traversari Salazar catalogue. The Rephann Catalogue is prepared with attention to detail- in description, layout, and photography-and should, once the com- plete Traversari Collection is exhibited, be easy to use. It can serve as a scholarly model for future catalogues of other significant but as yet inadequately documented instrument collections. Recent conversations with Sr. Vicente Mena and Sr. Carlos Coba have produced certain background data pertinent to the 1971 and 1978 catalogues. Coba contributed significantly to the 1971 descrip- tions of Ecuadorian indigenous instruments. A series of presidents of the Casa de la Cultura believed, after the publication of the 1971 catalogue, that a new catalogue would be needed. Their moti- vations were twofold: first, rumors about the presence in the Tra- versari Collection of exceptionally valuable instruments, such as Stradivarii, had to be squelched permanently; and second, there was the need to separate the genuine from the spurious. In the recent Catalogue, Rephann identifies, among allegedly fake aerophones, two clay quenas, thirty-three duct flutes, and twenty-nine cross-blown flutes, most of the latter two categories being anthropomorphic and zoomorphic silbatos and flutes. Among chordophones, one harp (4008) is alleged fake. The publication of the 1978 Rephann Catalogue is phase one of Museum Director Mena's quadripartite plan: (1) the publication</page><page sequence="8">272 : Reviews of a new catalogue done by a specialist; (2) the restoration of certain Traversari instruments, although Mena believes that today in Ecua- dor there are no professional restorers of musical instruments; (3) the establishment of a permanent exhibition of the instruments in the newly constructed Casa de la Cultura museum building behind the present building; and (4) the opening of that exhibition to the public. The majority of the Traversari Collection instruments today lie in boxes in the new building, awaiting the release of government funds for exhibition. Mena has received a recent promise from Sr. Jaime Rold6s, president of Ecuador, that the exhibition should be in place by December 6, 1980. Funds are available for new ac- quisitions to the Traversari Collection, but these must have Ecuadorian provenance. Searching for a specialist to compile the new catalogue, the Casa de la Cultura requested the assistance of the Organization of American States. The OAS contracted Rephann and funded his nine months' work. Mena believes that specialists and institutions may presently be able to obtain a copy (for an as yet undetermined price) by writing to the OAS, Washington, D.C. The morning of March 17, 1980, this writer was privileged to view Traversari Collection instruments from a closed, unnumbered, and incomplete exhibit on the mezzanine level of the new building of the Casa de la Cultura. Sixty-six chordophones, fifty-seven aero- phones, no membranophones, and no idiophones were observed atop shelves and in uncovered cabinets. Other than missing strings, the instruments were largely well preserved. From these relatively few instruments, the potpourri character of the Traversari Collection was evident. Triangular harp (with crocodile-shell-covered soundbox) stood next to double-bass. Violins and rabels rested beneath flageolets, flutes in the shapes of walking canes. A nineteenth-century European lyre-guitar reminded one of the lyre in the seal of Canton Cotacachi, birthplace of musicologists Segundo Luis Moreno and Carlos Coba and of scores of other fine, if lesser-known, indigenous and mes- tizo musicians. lWhen the Traversari Collection, complete and properly identified numerically according to the Rephann Catalogue, is finally per- manently exhibited, it will be required viewing for Latin American organologists. Witness the reaction of the distinguished Cuban ethnomusicologist, Fernando Ortiz, to his visit to the Traversari Collection: "Esperaba encontrar en Quito cosas sorprendentes por su valor de estudio hist6rico y arqueologico y las encontre. Pero</page><page sequence="9">Reviews : 273 mi mayor sorpresa en esas lineas de cultura ha sido la de este museo de musicologia. Obra de una vida y de genio.

Until recently, most of the organological research in Peru has con- centrated either on the study of pre-Columbian musical instruments or on the study of contemporary instruments in an attempt to speculate about pre-Columbian musical culture. It is, therefore, gratifying for students interested in current Peruvian musical and material culture that the Instituto Nacional de Cultura has produced this fairly comprehensive catalogue of the musical instruments presently in use in Peru. The work considers indigenous, mestizo, and, to a lesser degree, European musical instruments used in the performance of Peruvian folk and tribal music. The book is seen by its authors as a first step in contemporary Peruvian organology that might serve as a springboard for more detailed studies in the future. The research was undertaken by a team comprised of the following scholars: the well-known musicologist Josafat Roel Pineda, the Chilean composer/researcher Fernando Garcia, and Alida Salazar, a research associate of the Instituto Nacional de Cultura.
