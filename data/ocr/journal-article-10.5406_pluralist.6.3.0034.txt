<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> We Are Hers erin mckenna Pacific Lutheran University “we are hers.” these words were said by Deborah Fouts during an  interview a former student and I conducted with Roger and Deborah Fouts.  We had asked them when they thought Project Washoe had really become  theirs by choice and they knew this would be their life’s work. Deborah said,  “It started in Oklahoma, but wasn’t really ours until we came to Ellensburg.”  Then she said, “I don’t know if it’s really ever been ‘ours.’ It’s not that it’s  ours, we are hers.” These words say a lot.  Their commitment to Washoe, Moja, Tatu, Dar, and Loulis has never  been about fame, career advancement, or money. In fact, their approach to  the chimpanzees places them well outside the norm in their own discipline  of experimental psychology and academia in general. When my student and  I conducted the interview, we were interested in finding out what kinds  of philosophical commitments (metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical)  framed their position. My belief was (and is) that the Fouts hold many views  in common with American pragmatism. While they work with people like  Peter Singer to try to improve the lives of apes, they are clearly not utilitarian.  While they argue for the abolition of zoos and the use of apes in biomedical  research, they do eat humanely raised animals and so are not consistent with  Tom Regan’s deontological approach. (In fact, their discussion of what they  eat matches Steve Fesmire’s position in his chapter in Animal Pragmatism,  “Dewey and Animal Ethics.”) They do speak often about the importance of  developing compassion, tempting me to lean toward the ethic of care. But  there are differences here as well. Here, in brief, is what I have found: • They share a pragmatist/feminist epistemology—rejecting dualisms,  embracing a social self, seeing the self as more than rational and self- interested, embracing a critical relativism, understanding all knowl- the pluralist Volume 6, Number 3 Fall 2011 : pp. 34–43 34  ©2011 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois Pluralist 6_3 text.indd   34 9/13/11   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="2"> mckenna : We Are Hers 35 edge is perspectival in nature—knowledge and truth are partial, per- spectival, and tentative. • They share a pragmatist/ecofeminist metaphysics—this position  is rooted in the fact that human beings are a kind of animal being  and that all animal beings share a great deal in common. Following  Peirce’s point that animal beings exist in a continuum without sharp  and definitive breaks, we need to learn to see the things we share and  the ways in which we differ from one another. There is, however, no  human exceptionalism. • They live by a pragmatist/feminist ethic—it suggests an approach to  understanding and improving relationships that is rooted in humil- ity, caution, and respect. It is an ethic that can take us on the next  stage of “our journey towards a non-oppressive form of the mixed- community and a liveable future respectfully shared with animals.”  (Plumwood 166)  For those who know something about American pragmatism (or neo- pragmatism) it may seem an odd place to develop a discussion of respectful  relationships between human beings and other animal beings. There are some  reasons for this possible confusion. First, some of the leading figures of prag- matism (James and Dewey) said some things about other animal beings that  demonstrate a lack of understanding and respect for these beings.1 However,  they each also said things that argue for greater respect and understanding,  and their overall views demand an approach of respect and understanding.  Second, the more “public” perception of pragmatism is often one of a mecha- nistic, problem-solving approach that uncritically endorses science and tech- nology as a “solution.” This is a very limited, and incorrect, understanding  of pragmatism. Pragmatism understands human embeddedness in a variety  of transformative relationships with the rest of nature. It also acknowledges  the complex ways these interactions can be understood and improved. And  finally, if all one knows of pragmatism is the work of Richard Rorty and other  neo-pragmatists, the discussion here may come as a surprise. Pragmatism is  not all about language and communities of interpretation. The other ani- mal beings in our lives are flesh-and-blood beings with whom we interact;  they affect our lives. They have changed us as much (or more) than we have  changed them—not just conceptually but literally, that is, physically, socially,  and mentally.  I think it is important to add American pragmatism to the philosophical  and public discourse concerning the relationships among human and other  animal beings. The conversation has been dominated by the views of utili- Pluralist 6_3 text.indd   35 9/13/11   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="3"> 36 the pluralist 6 : 3 2011 tarians such as Peter Singer and rights-based theorists such as Tom Regan.  There are more feminist voices now—voices such as those of Carol Adams  and Josephine Donovan. Care ethics and virtue ethics (Martha Nussbaum)  have also begun to make an impact. Despite the wide variety both among and  within these views, most fall prey to the assumption that humans are some- thing both physically separate from other animal beings and ontologically  distinct and exceptional. This supports the idea that humans are in control  of other animal beings. On this view those animal beings whom we do not  control should just be left alone. These free-living or “wild” animal beings  are seen as somehow uninfluenced by humans much as “wilderness” is often  conceived of as free from human influence and impact. From a pragmatist  perspective this makes no sense. As soon as human beings began to emerge,  we began to influence our environment and all the creatures in it, just as the  environment and the creatures in it influenced us. There is no radical separa- tion or distinction. Rather there is inter-relatedness from the start.  However, when one hears William James say “[t]he world stands really  malleable, waiting to receive its final touches at our hands. . . . [I]t suffers hu- man violence willingly” (115), one begins to think of pragmatism as supporting  a notion of human privilege and human dominion. This kind of statement  implies a human-centered approach to understanding the rest of nature and  suggests we see nature as a resource for our use. It does not do much to change  one’s impression of pragmatism when we hear from John Dewey: “To prefer  the claims of the physical suffering of animals to the prevention of death and  the cure of disease . . . does not rise even to the level of sentimentalism. . . .  It is accordingly the duty of scientific men to use animal experimentation as  an instrument in the promotion of social well-being” (100).  Given pragmatism’s own claims, however, these statements are not rep- resentative. Pragmatism, in general, does not see the rest of nature as simply  a resource for satisfying our human needs and desires. Instead, pragmatism  highlights our connectedness with the rest of nature. Pragmatists point out  that after Darwin, the radical separation of human beings and other animal  beings, which supports the idea of mastery and promotes the exclusive focus  on use value, makes no sense. Instead, along with C. S. Peirce, we need to  remember that all life exists in a continuum. His notion of synechism is the  idea that all things are connected. “In a synechistic world . . . all borders are  continuous and consequently are inherently vague” (Anderson 87). From  this beginning pragmatism calls us to respect the continuity and complexity  of our relationships with the rest of nature. This continuity is not just about  shared genetics, evolutionary history, and physical structures. It is also that  Pluralist 6_3 text.indd   36 9/13/11   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="4"> mckenna : We Are Hers 37 we share a desire for affiliation, a propensity to rivalry, a capacity for affec- tion, and often can be motivated by fear and greed (Sabloff 49).  Generally, pragmatism is a philosophy that is naturalistic, developmen- tal, pluralistic, experimental, and fallibilistic. It is naturalistic in that it sees  humans as part of the natural order, subject to the same processes of evolu- tion. Human beings are not a radically different kind of being. Pragmatism  is developmental in that it sees the world and the creatures in it as being in  process—not finished or static. As Darwin argued, we are all still in the mak- ing, and relationships among various beings are also always in the making.  The naturalism and developmentalism shows us that in this “making,” other  animal beings both adapt to various environments and adapt the environ- ment to their needs and desires. The relationships among humans and other  animal beings include mutual modification. Thus, human beings are not so  different from other animal beings, and all of us—human and other animal  beings alike—are who and how we are as a result of interacting with each  other over time. This view is supported by contemporary science: We share with other species a common relationship with the Earth. In  accepting the biocentric outlook we take the fact of our being an animal  species to be a fundamental feature of our existence. We consider it an  essential aspect of “the human condition.” We do not deny the differ- ences between ourselves and other species, but we keep in the forefront  of our consciousness the fact that in relation to our planet’s natural eco- systems we are but one species population among many. (Taylor 106)  Such a view does not mean there are no differences to consider. There are.  We must take into account both cuts and continuity. John McDermott notes: We do not fit into the world as a Lego piece or a Lincoln Log. In fact,  I believe that we have no special place in the organic constituency of  nature. Our consciousness—so different, so extraordinary, so bizarre,  especially in its dream state—is a marvelous and pockmarked perturba- tion of the eonic history of DNA. Following Dewey, we are in, of, and  about nature. We are nature’s creature, its consciousness, its conscience,  however aberrant and quixotic; its organizer, namer, definer, and de- filer; a transient in search of an implacable, probably unrealizable, final  consummation. The human organism is surrounded, permeated, and  contexted by both the natural and social environments. (373) We are both continuous and distinct. It is important for some purposes to  recognize the differences and for other purposes to focus on the similarities.  For instance, we divide beings into species and focus on similarities within  Pluralist 6_3 text.indd   37 9/13/11   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="5"> 38 the pluralist 6 : 3 2011 a species. Of course there are ambiguities in all species distinctions, and  there is wide variation (difference) within any defined species. Nonetheless,  the species distinction is useful and informative. Technically, “[t]he species  is the correct boundary for this degree of similarity because it is the poten- tially interbreeding population that is the receptacle for the consequences of  natural selection” (Mitchell 109). Further, as we study beings within species,  we notice regular patterns that help us understand and interact with them.  “Race in humans is not a significant grouping at all, but species in animals  certainly is. . . . [W]ith an animal, to know the species is absolutely essential.  . . . Even members of quite similar and closely related species can have entirely  different needs about temperature and water supply, bedding, exercise-space,  solitude, company, and many other things. Their vision and experience of  the world must therefore be profoundly different” (Midgley 122). Noting  the differences helps us negotiate respectful and successful relationships with  other animal beings.  However, evolution also entails continuity. It does not make evolution- ary sense to suppose consciousness emerged only in humans, especially since  other creatures have brains and similar neural chemistry. As Bernard Rollins,  in The Unheeded Cry, points out, [e]volution entails continuity, and molecular biology has elegantly un- derscored that continuity at the cellular, subcellular, and biochemical  levels. In so far as humans represent a step in the evolution of life, they  share with other creatures enzymes, proteins, functions, and structures.  It would be evolutionarily odd if consciousness had emerged solely in  humans, especially in light of the presence in other creatures of brains,  nervous systems, sense-organs, learning, pain, behavior, problem-solv- ing, and so on. Continuity and small variation constitute the rule of  living things. (32) As evidence of this Rollins notes that continuity can be found in the use of  signs. He uses pragmatism (specifically Peirce) to understand the continuity  and so help us understand our relationship with other animal beings. [I]n the final analysis, much of sign interpretation involves being car- ried from what is present to what is not. Furthermore, as Peirce pointed  out, all sign cognition is triadic, involving sign, what is signified, and  some interpretation in the mind of the subject. Thus, even the ability  to respond to natural signs bespeaks the presence of mind. And in so  far as animals, even insects, interpret the world, perceive objects and  events as signs of food, shelter, egg-laying space, or whatever, they must  be said to have some subjective mental experience. (220) Pluralist 6_3 text.indd   38 9/13/11   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="6"> mckenna : We Are Hers 39 Given this continuity, we need a non-reductive naturalism that can take both  nature and culture into account as we seek ethical and fulfilling relationships  with other beings. In Being Human, Anna Peterson notes that “[w]e do not  need to choose between biology and culture in making sense of human na- ture” (184, 192). Humans, as natural beings, are part of the natural order. So,  our cultures—language, arts, tools—are natural as well. This is a naturalist  position—a non-reductive realism (73–75). The non-reductive part is key,  as we need to avoid the idea of fixed and unchanging natures. At the same  time, however, we need to not deny the tendencies we observe.  Further, we cannot simply dismiss evolution and naturalism as bad re- sources for ethics. As Peterson suggests, [i]f humans are not outside its compass, then evolution must bear on  philosophical anthropology and on ethics. . . . This means we cannot  dismiss evolutionary naturalism as an irremedial fallacious resource for  ethics. We need to find ways to move from evolutionary theory, as a  general description of how the world works, to ethical reasoning and  judgment. We must step cautiously, hedging our bets and taking the  long way around, but we must look for a way. (173) To get started on this, Mary Midgley notes that evolution tells us we are ani- mals, not just that we are like animals. This is an important insight. Equally  important, though, is Peterson’s insight that  We cannot differ from animals in general anymore than a squirrel or  a salmon can. This does not mean that we do not differ from other  animals, just as squirrels and salmon differ from each other, and both  from dragonflies. However, opponents of evolutionary interpretations  of human nature often seem to prefer binary opposition—human or  animal—to the continuum (or series of overlapping continua) suggested  by evolution. (174) We do differ, but the difference does not set us completely apart. “Continuity,  relationships of interdependence, and similarity . . . do not deny particular- ity. They do deny that a certain kind of natural object, and only that kind,  stands absolutely apart from and above all the rest” (Peterson 215). Humans  have wanted to “stand absolutely apart from and above all the rest.” This has  been done through religion and the idea that humans alone are created in  the image of the divine, and it has been done in science with the supposedly  unique ability of humans to reason and have language. However, human be- ings cannot completely escape the role of biology in shaping what and who  they are. Peterson notes: Pluralist 6_3 text.indd   39 9/13/11   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="7"> 40 the pluralist 6 : 3 2011 Humans are natural and cultural animals, created both as individuals and  as a species out of the interactions between these features. The interactions  of nature and culture in humans have parallels and continuities with the  interactions of biology and environment experienced by other species. . . .  Many species shape their environments even as those environments shape  them, and humans do this to a greater extent than other animals. In this  sense we construct ourselves, as any understanding of humanness must  acknowledge. However, this constructionism must include the recogni- tion that we do not create ourselves ex nihilo, or in isolation, or just as we  please. . . . . Biology and culture help determine each other, and neither  one alone can explain what it means to be human. (196)  So, while we need to be careful about using biology to justify cultural or  social constructions and biases (using biological determinism to support sexist,  racist, classist, speciesist prejudices), we also need to be careful about appealing  to social and cultural practices as if there were no biological roots to, or influ- ences on, how we understand and organize ourselves. The interface of culture  and biology can help us examine our relationship with other animal beings. For  instance, we should note that “[w]e are bond forming creatures, not abstract  intellects” (Midgley 125). Our bonds with our family are a reason why we often  put their interests before those of other people. Yet we have social and cultural  rules and practices that often extend our consideration. As Midgley notes, “The  question which people who want to use the notion of speciesism have to decide  is, does the species barrier also give some ground for such a preference or not?”  (125). Species bonds are real. “All social creatures attend mostly to members of  their own species, and usually ignore others” (129–30).   However, cross-species bonds are real too. “For we have to notice next that  species-loyalty in social animals, strong though it is, is not necessarily exclusive.  At an ordinary social level, creatures of different species are certainly often aware  of each other, and are probably interacting quietly far more than we realize.”  These relationships often form when an animal of one species has none of its  own around. But sometimes there is a preference for a cross-species relation- ship. “More remarkable still, an outsider may be cherished even when one’s  own species is present. A clear instance is the well-established tendency of race- horses to become attached to some apparently unimpressive stable-companion,  such as a goat or even a cat, and to pine if they are separated from it” (132–33).  So, while recognizing a biological tendency to prefer one’s own species helps  us understand certain behavior, it does not justify ignoring the variations in  behavioral possibilities. Nor does it justify rigid rules or boundaries. What we  see is variation and plasticity. This, in part, is why pragmatism is pluralistic. Pluralist 6_3 text.indd   40 9/13/11   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="8"> mckenna : We Are Hers 41  Pragmatism is pluralistic in that it notes that we each have only a partial  take on the world, and it seeks to incorporate as many viewpoints as possible.  As Franklin suggests, “The life of a particular individual in a given species  will vary with its circumstances” (101). Not only do we have to consider the  specific perspectives of a given species, but we also need to consider the indi- vidual—the individual’s age, health, and personality. We need to go beyond  simply accepting plurality, to see with other species and individual beings  (Peterson 237).  Related to the recognition of pluralism, pragmatism is also experimental  in that it does not seek final solutions but seeks better working hypotheses  to help us cope with the plurality we encounter in our lives. We work to  organize our experience in ways that are satisfactory, but we must always be  open to revision. We must learn and develop if we are to survive and grow.  Given that, denying our fallibility is problematic, as are actions that close off  future possibilities and revisions of our action. One of the most important  points of pragmatism is to be able to learn and grow in applying intelligence  to our relations. To do this, pragmatism must embrace fallibilism—the idea  that we are usually mistaken in some way about what we think we “know.”  We must learn from past experience and be open to revising our understand- ing of things. Just because we treat other animal beings in a certain way, or  have done so in the past, does not mean this cannot and should not change.  Fallibilism opens up the possibility of new understandings and new ways of  acting. “The history of many of the ways in which we currently live with  animals offers some sobering reminders that those ways have a source; that  is, that they are not natural. It is also included to remind us that many of  our apparently friendly gestures towards other species are grounded in a firm  belief in human superiority rather than a concept of animal ‘worth’” (Fudge  10). As our understanding of the continuity of human beings with other life  and our ability to see the world from a plurality of perspectives constantly  challenge notions of human superiority, we must also revise our practices.  Practices rooted in notions of superiority may no longer serve human beings  now (if they ever did). We must realize that [e]very organism, species population, and community of life has a good  of its own which moral agents can intentionally further or damage by  their actions. . . . One can act in its overall interest or contrary to its  overall interest, and environmental conditions can be good for it (ad- vantageous to it) or bad for it (disadvantageous to it). What is good for  an entity is what “does it good” in the sense of enhancing or preserving  its life and well-being. (Taylor 97) Pluralist 6_3 text.indd   41 9/13/11   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="9"> 42 the pluralist 6 : 3 2011 Pluralism and fallibilism should help us see that to do good for our own  species, or for other species, we need to do more than protect other ani- mal beings just in order to use them. We need to not ignore or trade their  good just for human benefit. We need to recognize “that nonhumans have  interests that are not tradable or able to be ignored merely because humans  will benefit from doing so” (Francione 114). Given our continuity, our well- being overlaps with the well-being of other animal beings. We need to begin  to experiment with different ways to live with other animal beings in more  satisfactory and respectful ways.  A superficial understanding of pragmatism may lead one to believe it  would support a kind of “application of intelligence” to control and manage  other animal beings for human beings’ use. I believe it is a more complex and  nuanced outlook. Nevertheless, pragmatism, does not ignore issues of human  use, and in some instances does tend to put human use more front and center  than some other philosophies appear to do. Further, while pragmatists are  pluralists and remain open to exploring various practices, pragmatism does  not suggest being shortsighted or greedy when settling on our desired ends,  nor does it justify denying our connectedness with the rest of nature.  The very emergence of human beings is connected to the evolutionary  history of all mammals. The history of all mammals is connected to the evo- lutionary history of reptiles, insects, plants, and so on. The very possibility  of humans emerged from past conditions, and the continuing pressure and  process of human evolution influenced the conditions in which all the life  we know exists.  To get to a working ethic that can help guide the various relationships  among human beings and other animal beings, we need an understanding  of ourselves that acknowledges the evolutionary realities while understand- ing that the evolutionary histories do not fully determine or constrain the  present or future possibilities. Pragmatism is uniquely well suited to do this  work. The Fouts’s lives provide an example of this ethic being lived out, and  I thank them for the opportunity to observe and learn from their example  over the years. notes  1. I will be using “pragmatism” as shorthand for the some of the general views attrib- uted to classical American pragmatism.
