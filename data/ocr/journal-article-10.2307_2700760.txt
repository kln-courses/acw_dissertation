<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reel Nature: Americas Romance with Wildlife on Film. By Gregg Mitman. (Cambridge: Har- vard University Press, 1999. x, 263 pp. $29.95, ISBN 0-674-71571-3.) Like so much of post-World War II American pop culture, nature and wilderness on film was not quite what it seemed to millions of baby boom families in their suburban living rooms. Gregg Mitman, assistant professor of the history of science and technology at the University of Oklahoma, suggests in this thought-provoking study of the art and arti- fice of nature films that contemporary beliefs about environmental policy had their origins in a century of movies, television shows, pho- tography books, and the like. "We no longer work with animals," notes Mitman; instead, "we predominantly watch them." In progress- ing toward an ever-more-urban and -postin- dustrial life, "nature films then and now reveal much about the yearnings of Americans to both be close to nature and yet distinctly apart." It is this question of the "sentimentalizing" of wilderness as represented on screen that drives Mitman's analysis of middlebrow (and at times burlesque) readings of the world around us. From the efforts of Progressives such as President Theodore Roosevelt (himself the product of contrived images of manliness and vigor) to maintain the best of the Ameri- can frontier tradition through the late-twenti- eth-century desire for nature without humans, the wealthiest nation in the world underesti- mated the costs of comfort and security. Whether dealing with the sexuality of dol- phins, the anthropomorphism of animals, or the redefinition of Africa from a "dark conti- 1620 March 2002</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 1621 nent" to an ecological paradise, Americans have chosen to believe what they wanted about the blessings and curses of resource de- velopment. For this reviewer, Mitman's narrative spoke most cogently when citing the unintended consequences of America's explanations to it- self about the globalization of nature. The Walt Disney Company (the focus of several re- cent works critical of its falsification of the past) was honest in its attempts to appeal to the wishes of boomer parents to avoid displays of violence and sexuality on screen, while Marlin Perkins and his Wild Kingdom pre- saged the "survivor island" phenomenon of the early twenty-first century. Most intrigu- ing, however, was the author's postulation of a circular logic about the environmental move- ment of the 1960s and 1970s. Inspired by the very shows of Perkins and Disney that culture studies devotees found wanting, environmen- tal resistance to development could be as- suaged only with Edenic policies and legisla- tion that undid the harm of man in nature. If Mitman's thesis is timely, his research methods might be enhanced by the use of oral interviews and documents germane to the mood shifts in public consciousness about na- ture. Anxiety about modernization has shaped much about American life over the past hun- dred years. Yet his conclusion bears repeating, if only because of the failure of many on both sides of the preservation/development debate to appreciate the irony that "we only know na- ture because we intervene."
