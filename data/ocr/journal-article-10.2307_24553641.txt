Koslow Δ Tim Rollins + Κ.O.S., The Scarlet Letter /, acrylic, watercolor, and bistre on book pages on linen (108x140 in.), 1987-88. Courtesy Thomas Amman. Artist Tim Rollins and his South Bronx teen age collaborators, who call themselves K.O.S. (Kids of Survival), present a unique blend of conceptual and political art. The K.O.S. are an outgrowth of a special program Rollins created in 1982 for learning disabled and/or emotionally handicapped teenagers with art talent. For Rollins + K.O.S., art is intrinsi cally related to language and culture. Work ing together, they paint images on the pages of some of the greatest books of Western liter ature. These images evolve from reading and debating such works as The Scarlet Letter, Ani mal Farm, The Red Badge of Courage, and Moby Dick. Through doodling sessions and discus sions of a book's salient symbols, an image is derived that corresponds to, but is not an illustration of, the original text. This image is developed by individual members of the col laborative group, transferred onto acetate, and projected onto geometric grounds con sisting of pages from the actual books ar ranged on canvas in careful grids. Once scale and composition have been selected, the im age is rendered by the more expert members of the group, who range from 11 to 19 years old, onto the mounted book pages. In The Scarlet Letter (1987-88), for example, a series of eight individual, boldly designed, red and gold letter A s are strewn across a 9xl2-ft. canvas-mounted backdrop of pages from Hawthorne's novel. Rollins discussed issues of guilt and castigation with members of K.O.S. and related Hester Prynne's stigma of shame to their own denigration by the white establishment. Particular attention, however, was paid to Hawthorne's description of Hester's artistic talent with needlework, with which she turned a symbol of shame into one of pride and beauty: On the breast of her gown, in fine red cloth, surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold thread, appeared the letter A. It was so artistically done, and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy, that it had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration to apparel which she wore.... After reading Hawthorne's description of the beautiful scarlet letter and studying different typefaces, each in the group created a per sonal vision of the letter A as a symbol of pride. The eight red and gold letters they created reflect individual interpretations, ranging from Rollins' tall and straight Con structivist A, which he borrowed from Rod chenko, to letters that are scriptlike or anthro pomorphic. When I asked Rollins to elaborate on how each of the student's letters were generated, he explained, "Some kids take a visual cue from their environment, like a sign that they like on the street. Many of the As are sheer figments of the imagination."' Rollins also emphasized the idea that each A functions as self-portrait. In this way, the original text's theme and imagery are made to span past and present. Rollins, born in Pittsfield, Maine, in 1955, has an M.A. in Art Education, and since his student years has been active in the political wing of the Conceptual art movement in New York. He received his education in Concep tual art working under Joseph Kosuth toward a B.F.A. at the School of Visual Arts from 1976 to 1978. Kosuth, a renowned formulator of Conceptual art theory and an original member of the Art &amp; Language group, was one of the first to take art beyond the object into the realm of language, knowledge, and worldly data. Rollins pays homage to Kosuth, but does not share his rejection of emotional charge. "Although, like Kosuth, we're pretty cold and calculated in the way that we make the work, we're different," Rollins told me. "In a way, we're similar to Gerhard Richter, who uses very cold, calculated methodology in terms of the production of the pieces, yet the works have an emotional charge, so they appeal not only to the intellect but to the intuition as well." In 1979, Rollins cofounded the East Vil lage collective Group Material, an advocate for socially committed art. Group Material organized media and collaborative exhibi tions around such themes as alienation, gen der, and the Atlanta child murders. Rollins also began teaching in 1980 in the Learning to Read Through the Arts Program and spent two years working in New York's poorest mi nority neighborhoods—-Jamaica, Queens; Harlem; and the South Bronx. In 1982, he began teaching full-time at Intermediate School #52 in the South Bronx, working with students who had learning and behavioral problems, particularly problems with liter acy. Art became the "glue" for teaching math, history, literature, and philosophy to his "kids," most of whom were artistically inclined. "They're the ones who doodle elaborately on the back of their notebooks during math class instead of completing their assignments."2 Until 1987, Rollins taught seven 45-minute classes of 30 students each at I.S. #52 during the day and then worked after school with willing students from his classes in a studio two blocks away. The after-school sessions turned into a group of about 12 students led by Rollins. Last year, he began working inde pendently from I.S. #52 and developed the Art and Knowledge Workshop, where he is artist-in-residence as well as director of Kids of Survival. Survival is often the subject of their lives and their art work. "I want to explode the predominant culture of silence that has invaded the lives of the poor and working class," Rollins explained to an audi ence at Boston's Institute of Contemporary Art in May, 1988. "I chose to use great works of literature as the symbol of our survival as a species." Rollins came up with the idea of painting on book pages quite by accident. He was reading a book aloud to his class when an extremely dyslexic student, Carlos Rivera, started drawing on Rollins' personal copy of the text. After initial anger, Rollins decided that the student had not desecrated his book 139 I A ii Tim Rollins + Κ.O.S., The Scarlet Letter /, acrylic, watercolor, and bistre on book pages on linen (108x140 in.), 1987-88.

As Rollins explained it to me, What was amazing was that he hadn't simply scribbled on the book, but in his imagery, he had typified the book in an incredible way. This was very similar in spirit to the way that Odilon Redon captured the spirit and feeling of Edgar Allan Poe without directly illustrating him. What Carlos had done was to come up with a visual correspondence to the text. Rollins took out the pages and mounted them on a support. "The pages became a kind of curtain of history upon which we re-wrote and re-read the literature with our imagery."3 The tension between the static grid of the pages and the variety of shapes painted on them is the work's formal basis. Rollins' insis tence on the grid puts him in conscious dia logue with Minimalists like Agnes Martin, whose square grid canvases are defined by delicate lines, or Hanne Darboven, who cre ates page after page of abstract calligraphy to mass on a wall. Although the process of tak ing books apart and pasting page after page in rows on fine linen is acknowledged by the artist to be somewhat formulaic, the paint ings allow the individual talents of the group to emerge. "The real discovery was that Carlos could use a text to take off from with his own ideas. I figured that if Carlos could do this, then all the kids could do this. And if all the kids could do this, then I could do this." Tim Rollins + K.O.S. most often work in a series, major canvases usually containing the entire text of the book, with variations in the painted imagery. The large-scale works are often accompanied by numerous smaller studies on a single page. The best known series is Amerika, inspired by Franz Kafka's comic story of Karl Rossmann, a poor Euro pean boy of 16 years, who has been packed off to New York by his parents for having im pregnated a servant girl. In America, land of opportunity, Karl falls into the clutches of an assortment of rogues. It is the last chapter, "Nature Theatre of Oklahoma," that has in spired the imagery of the Amerika series since 1985. In the book's climax, Karl comes across a placard announcing, "The Oklahoma The atre will engage members for its company today at Clayton race-course from six o'clock in the morning until midnight.... If you want to be an artist, join our company!" When Karl gets to Clayton, he hears at once the cacaphonous noise of many trumpets and, in a surrealistic scene, sees before the entrance to the racecourse a long, low plat form, "on which hundreds of women dressed as angels in white robes with great wings on their shoulders were blowing on long trum pets that glittered like gold." After reading and discussing the ironic novel, the group decided on the image of a golden horn. Taking this symbol to be the essence of the novel's allegorical description of American democracy, Rollins told his audi ence at the ICA he gave his students the as signment, "If you could represent your voice, your freedom, your destiny, and everything that is in you, in the form of a golden horn, what would it look like?" At first, influenced by an Emlen Etting text illustration and by the students' own notions of a Prince Valiant horn, the results were uninspired. Finally, after weeks of struggle, Gregory Torres, then 12, came up with a horn that looked anthro pomorphic—as if it had breasts and testicles. Each student then came up with his or her unique anthropomorphic horn. The result is a dramatic series of gold acrylic painted horns, accented by black china marker, strewn across the text of Amerika. "It is almost like a battle painting," says Rollins, "with each horn battling for its own sense of time,</page><page sequence="3">their own space, their own dignity, and their own voice."4 In Amerika III (1986-87), a huge (68x168 in.) canvas, the fanciful golden horns grow from a central geometric image alluding to the train tracks Karl crosses on his way to "American Democracy." The extravagant gold trumpets, like medieval manuscript illu mination, are created by many hands, but Rollins claims to know the author of each horn. In a challenging installation at Jay Gor ney Modern Art Gallery in March 1988, Rol lins + K.O.S. grouped 80 individually framed pages from Amerika, each graced with a single trumpet, on two walls of the lower gallery. Number 28, a study for Amerika X (1987-88), contains a two-sided horn collaged over the first page of Chapter I, "The Stoker." Jose Parissi, now 18 and one of the more tal ented artists of the group, created this delicate and calligraphic configuration, whose contours come together in a victorious letter V. The 12th painting in the Amerika series, Amerika for Thoreau (1987-88) was created in situ for a spring exhibition at Boston's Insti tute of Contemporary Art. In a special collab oration between Rollins' South Bronx team (which then included Angel Abreu, Howard Britton, Richard Cruz, George Garces, Nel son Montes, Pablo Ortiz, and Parissi) and eight students from Boston's English High School (Robert W. Blair, Keith Cappuccio, Hans Desrosiers, Jennifer Goss, Norma Hickey, Michael Maachi, Brett Michel, and Frank Tipping III), Rollins orchestrated a two-day workshop.'' Like I.S. #52, English High is an inner-city school dominated by minority students. Rollins made two trips to Boston to meet with these eight students cho sen by their guidance counselor—upon Rol lins' instructions—not for their art talent, but because they needed to do an outside project for their interest and self-esteem. The En glish High students were part of the school's Fenway Program, designed for kids who, like those in K.O.S., needed individual attention and something different than the traditional classroom setting. A month before the Boston show, Rollins instructed the English High students to "draw anything that you want that comes from you in the shape of a horn that no one else has ever seen." When the K.O.S. arrived in Boston, copies of Thoreau's two-volume set of Journals, pa perback versions of Walden, comic books, and radios were strewn over drawing tables. Rol lins + K.O.S. taught the Boston students how to transfer their drawings to the canvas, and Rollins did most of the final cosmetic shading. In the final painting, the group com bined fanciful horns with images culled from Thoreau's journals, painted in gold over the entire text of Amerika. The central image is a huge golden wheel, suggested by a drawing that Thoreau made in the 1860s of the under side of a mushroom cap. Rollins selected the Thoreau drawing because it also reminded him of "a melted-down version of a Ducham pian bicycle wheel." Rollins stressed Thoreau in the Amerika painting because "the meaning of Thoreau was beginning to hit me between the eyes as an artist, educator, and thinker." The group experience was good for Rollins + K.O.S. and especially positive for Boston stu dents like Jennifer Goss, who told me she still can't believe she "created something like this that went up onto a canvas and was a piece of art. I developed my self-confidence about making art and working with people."6 The final image appears so cohesive as to have been executed by a single person. Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage, a novel about a young boy's awakening while a soldier in the Civil War, has inspired a series of elegant and highly lyrical canvases entitled Red Badge. Rather than selecting a scene, Rol lins + K.O.S. concentrated on a single image —that of a wound—suggested by the theme of war and injury. Crane's hero Henry had imagined war to be glorious, but was disillu sioned by its bloodshed and annihilation. For Rollins, Red Badge is about the beauty of sur vival, as Henry survives in the end. The scars in these canvases signify the vulnerability and the poignancy of survival. Red Badge of Courage III (1986-87) consists of a series of tiny erup tions splattered across the pages. The wounds were inspired by actual scars on two kids' bodies and by photographs of the galaxies. Other sources for the wounds, which in one series are painted with blood, are the stig mata of Christ in Griinewald's Isenheim Atlarpiece, and Peter Magubane's recent photographs of South African blacks in their struggle against apartheid—especially one that emphasizes the open stomach wound of a woman shot by the police. "I started out with the idea that the text was kind of like a body that was being shot. The pages were a sort of skin, a skin of history," Rollins remembers. A pall of white paint engulfs the pages of Herman Melville's Moby Dick in the Rollins + K.O.S. Minimalist masterwork, The Whiteness of the Whale (1985-88). Except for the chapter heading, the original text is all but illegible, covered by veils of richly strewn white paint inspired by the explosions of white paint in the central portion of Turner's Slave Ship (1839). Rollins + K.O.S. discussed the evil represented by the whiteness of Moby Dick and expanded the concept of whiteness as a symbol of evil. Rollins showed the K.O.S. illustrations of Turner's painting, which he had admired at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Turner's romantic, storm-tossed com position was itself inspired by a contemporary incident involving white men throwing black slaves overboard during a storm at sea. The result is a haunting image, reminiscent of Robert Ryman's all-white paintings, but symbolically a politically activist artwork, suggesting the evils of white supremacy. Rollins + K.O.S.'painterly politics go be yond the denunciation of racial typecasting and discrimination. A Journal of the Plague Year (1987-88) compares 17th-century fears of the plague, as described in 1722 by Daniel Defoe, with contemporary misinformation about AIDS. The composition is dominated by the word "Abracadabra" formed into an inverted pyramid. The image is taken from an original illustration of a passage in which Defoe says that the greatest madness caused by the plague was the superstitious belief in useless</page><page sequence="4">"cures." Defoe describes the popular belief that the plague was the result of possession by an evil spirit that could be kept off "with Crossings, Signs of the Zodiac, Papers tied up with so many Knots; and certain Words, or Figures written on them, as particularly the Word 'Abracadabra,' form'd in a Triangle, or Pyramid, thus." The cabalistic charm word, dating from the second century, proved useless against the plague's spread, and for Rollins symbolizes the timeless ignorance of people concerning disease. Rollins + K.O.S. enlarged the original illustration several times and painted it over the text in the "sacrificial" blood of a ram. They consequently turned Defoe's observations on the great London plague of 1665 into a 20th-century didactic diagram, a teaching device illustrating the geometric progression of the spread of AIDS, the plague of the 1980s. A Journal of the Plague Year also served as catharsis for Rollins and his students, some of whom have already lost parents to this disease. Rollins + K.O.S.' work is politically and socially conscious without being self-right eous. In an era of self-indulgence and com modification of the art object, these collabo rations are a welcome tonic. Rollins is akin to Leon Golub in his deep-felt political interests and commitment to the community, but less judgmental. The art he fosters urges its audi ence to go beyond questions of formalism. In Rollins' words: Art is most important to us as a means of knowl edge of the world. That means not just the "World" in capital letters, but the world of the self, the world of the street, the neighborhood, the world of the nation, the world of other places and other countries. It's just not producing ob jects but producing a form of critical thinking about the world. Through these objects, we can share our discoveries and our understandings with an audience, and hopefully they'll take up the mantle on their own. 'Tim Rollins interviewed by Francine A.
