<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILLIAM J. SCHEICK University of Texas at Austin Mary Austin's Disfigurement of the Southwest in The Land of Little Rain Although The Land of Little Rain (1903) was created to earn money,1 Austin also had higher motives. Earlier in her life, she had moved to the desert of southern California, where (her friend tells us) she had "felt the rigors and bleakness of the desert denied her a vocabulary and her mysticism."2 In time, Austin tried to appreciate better the strange beauty of this desert. The Land of Little Rain records her attempt to express this revised perception, especially of the "strange," which for her implies "a criticism of the familiar." The famil- iar "lack[s] any criterion of authority other than that it is ours," Austin observed.3 Her first book challenges "the familiar" not only in its setting but also in its search for the transcendent there. The sheer minimalism of the austere desert terrain presumably might facilitate the detection of the transcendent; in turn, her book further suggests, this detection presumably might facilitate a revision in her readers' perception of reality. Conveying the "strange" in this instance apparently did not require inordinate attention to style. Austin noted that "nothing was further from [her] mind when writing" The Land of Little Rain than "the ques- tion of style"; she had not considered style to be "a writer's problem."4 If we take her at her word, her first book may be read as a relatively unguarded account of her experiences. Austin's sections on the desert, even more than her few entries on the mountains, reveal not only the search but also the frustration of her desire for a transcendental en- counter. The fact of human mortality is the principal cause of this frustra- tion. This actuality contravenes Austin's attempt to detect the eternal in her temporal encounters. Symptomatic signs of Austin's unfulfilled desire surface in her art, especially in her tendency to transform descrip- tions of nature into autobiographic and anthropomorphic associations.</page><page sequence="2">38 Western A menean Literátu / e This manner of association amounts to a rhetorical dis-figurement and re-figurement of Austin's experience with nature. In short, Austin ap- propriates metaphorically (through dis-figurement) what is resistant to her metaphysically. This stylistic manner in effect replicates and reen- acts the physical disfigurement of the landscape that Austin explicitly denounces in her book. In The Land of Little Rain Austin particularly appreciates the minimalism of the desert. For her, the desert surpasses all other terrains. It intimates some eternal force at the core of the material world. "None other than this long brown land lays such a hold on the affections," she explains in her introductory sketch, "the rainbow hills, the tender bluish mists, the luminous radiance of the spring, have the lotus charm" and "trick the sense of time."5 This sentiment is reprised in the final sketch of The Land of Little Rain . There Austin reports that in the desert one may detect "a sense of presence and intention," an intimation of "eternal meaning" (246, 262). For Austin, the desert reflects a transcendent timelessness that she would like to believe redeems temporal experi- ence from its tragic transience and materiality.6 However, if nature conveys hints of the eternal, it also resists Austin's quest to close with the transcendent. Everywhere in nature she senses "purposes not revealed" (184) - something infinite that is inti- mated and at the same time resistant to human apprehension. The desert in particular always at once allows for "communion" with the "clear heavens" and, contrarily, takes a "toll"; it does so by suggesting in various dire ways that every viewer is "of no account" within the context of divine "imperturbable . . . purposes" (21, 186). The sempiternal "nature" she detects in this landscape is seemingly near to her spatially; but at the same time it remains apparently remote metaphysically. The spiritual fulfillment she seeks in the desert is rebuffed. As a "land that supports no man" and "sets the limit" (3) beyond what any human law might decree, the desert may metonymically reflect the eternal in na- ture, but it also especially seems antagonistically Other to Austin. She must remain a mortal viewer confined in time.7 As her allusion to the land of the lotus-eaters suggests, the Odysseus-like stranger must somehow forget the realities of the present, must somehow escape time if she is to merge with "the lotus charm" of the desert. Such "bewitched" evasion (17), such forgetting, would mean the end of the viewer as a viewer. It would mean going "mad in time" (69) , as she says at one point about the old miners who try to live in the</page><page sequence="3">William J. Scheick 39 desert. It would mean dying away from the physical world not only spiritually but also physically. Indeed, however much Austin seeks to focus her book on the intimations of transcendental wonder expressed in landscapes, her vi- sion is cluttered with iterated signs of nature's "elemental violence" (109; cf. 6). She finds reminders of mortality through violence every- where in nature. As her imagery suggests, she detects death even in "the terrible keen polish" and "saw-tooth effect" of majestic mountains with "long shark-finned ridges" (186). She especially emphasizes the signs of death evident in the southwestern desert, where she cannot help but notice, significantly in the first sketch of her book, an ominously repre- sentational "line of shallow graves" (18). Austin reads each of these graphic signs as a memento morì. These signs serve as emblems of her own physical mortality. They indicate her personal insignificance before nature's reductive "elemental violence" and, especially, point to her temporality. This temporality necessarily excludes her (as viewer) from the eternal. To fulfill her desire to encounter the transcendent apparently reflected in nature, to truly participate in "the splendor of the apocalypse" evidently revealed in the material creation (248), she would have to "forsake . . . most things but beauty and madness and death and God" (184). Austin would have to succumb to the desert's lotus-charm of forgetfulness. This forgetfulness would in effect be an apocalyptic obliviousness typical of death. To be the very perceiver she is in her book, however, she must be a temporal self confronted by the circumstance of her mortality. In other words, to have a self, an identity, a consciousness, she must remain estranged from the eternal. However much she yearns for closure with the divine, her temporality, her mortality prevents her from being an Emersonian "transparent eyeball" with "the currents of the Universal Being circulating] through" her.8 Austin, accordingly, tried in her book to embrace aesthetically this mortal opacity of her eye. She tried to accept her Odysseus-like foreign presence in the lotusland of nature. She hoped to redeem this experi- ence of exclusion through a documentary verbal art that might some- how serve, in a secondary way, to capture and convey a sense of the eternal in nature. She thus sought to be "a mere recorder" (112), as she called herself at one point in The Land of Little Rain. Given the mortal opacity of her eye, its lack of transparency in a metaphysical sense, "a mere recorder" was all Austin believed she could be. Her experience</page><page sequence="4">40 Western American Literature taught her that she could not become a primary Emersonian transpar- ent eyeball. So, perhaps, she hoped that the narrative objectivity of the "mere recorder" might at least provide a secondary kind of transpar- ency. Austin's use of the word mere reveals more than her humility before the majesty of nature; it also reveals her hesitant and unhappy acknowledgement of the barrier of temporality. Mortality, as signed in a land of "elemental violence," "sets the limits" of human perception. Besides the word mere , the disjointed narrative segmentation, the el- lipses within paragraphs, the periphrastic sentences, and the anxious shifts in point-of-view (between an individualistic / and a communal you)9 collectively suggest Austin's discomfort with and antipathy to the limited role of observer in The Land of Little Rain.10 This observation is perhaps substantiated by the fact that her next book, The Basket Woman (1904), does not relate her personal encounters with nature and, perti- nently, does not evidence the stylistic limitations evident in The Land of Little Rain. Austin prefers a more elemental and effulgent art than that of the "mere recorder." In The Land of Little Rain she idealizes art that origi- nates in "the satisfaction of desire" (171), not in its frustration and limitation. Any explanation of art other than satisfaction of desire, she says explicitly, is a contrived "house-bred theory" (171); that is, it is not a natural explanation. In fact, reflexive theorizing, as Austin herself is compelled to do in her book at this very moment of self-consciously commenting on art, strikes her as a symptom of her own opacity, of her own alienation in a lotusland of ideal forgetfulness and lack of con- sciousness. She accordingly idealizes Native Americans, who seem to her to be like the desert plants and animals. Each plant and animal, Austin ob- serves, inherently "knows its purpose" (221) and intrinsically mimics its "land [which] will not be lived in except in its own fashion" (88). Native Americans, in Austin's opinion, experience the divine mirrored in the land by "a sort of instinct atrophied by disuse in a complexer civiliza- tion" (234). Austin's book, thematically and aesthetically, registers her unrequited desire for a similar intimate, instinctive association with the "purpose" infusing whatever she reports in her limited capacity as a self- aware outsider behind opaque eyes. It is hardly surprising, moreover, that she longingly records her</page><page sequence="5">William J. Schrick 41 belief that "every Indian woman is an artist, - sees, feels, creates, but does not philosophize about her processes" (168-69). These women seem closer to the timeless eternal within nature; they seem more nearly to be the Emersonian transparency Austin wishes herself to be. Austin makes these observations while reporting on the baskets made by Seyavi, a Native American weaver, whom Austin admires for achieving "wonders of technical precision, inside and out" (169). Seyavi's Native American art manifests this gracefulness because it is informed by "the satisfaction of desire" (176). Nevertheless, it is important to note Austin's metaphor of mysterious, laborious, and possibly painful extraction when speaking of this aesthetic attainment in the metaphysical desert of mortal tempo- rality: "Seyavi had somehow squeezed out of her daily round a spiritual ichor that kept the skill in her knotted fingers long after the accustomed time, but that also failed" (176). Austin, too, tries to squeeze out of her temporal experience some transcendental ichor that will flow from her hand into her writing; but in contrast to Seyavi, she remains a frustrated "recorder" who produces a "knotted" work that is no wonder of technical precision. Austin's prob- lems with written expression, noted earlier, are features of aesthetic decomposition in her narrative that correspond to the many signs of physical decomposition in the desert. Each of these limitations in ex- pression, too, is a memento moň ; each suggests that "decomposing" mor- tality frustrates the human (and specifically Austin's) wish for closure with something transcendent. It is important to note, however, that what spiritual ichor even Seyavi "had somehow squeezed out of her daily round" had "also failed" her finally (emphasis added). That her temporal identity is a barrier to detecting the divine may be the painful truth Austin's reflexive theorizing mind unearths for itself in the metaphysical desert of human experience. But this self- consciousness, which only fuels Austin's longing for what she cannot have, becomes more of a problem than she knows. She senses that this reflexivity occludes the sort of instinct she admires in Native Americans, the instinct that would lead to a greater recollection of the transcendent in her own life and art. But she only senses this problem. Her unre- quited yearning, intensified by her reflexivity, refuses to be contained within her self-declared role in the book; and finally, this yearning subverts her conscious effort to accept the lesser avocation of being a mere observer. Ironically, her desire becomes an agent of her failure to</page><page sequence="6">42 Western American Literature achieve even the secondary, and second-best, transparency - that of an objective reporter of the "nobler plan" expressing the "long and imper- turbable . . . purposes of God" (186, 201). One indication of her failure as a documentary artist surfaces in her tendency to inscribe herself on and to read herself in the landscape she describes. Austin, as is well supported by her biographers, was an unhappy person. Enduring a troubled childhood, a failed marriage, the birth of a retarded daughter, recurrent awkward social interactions, a seemingly unpromising career, lingering illnesses, and a sense of herself as physically unattractive and frail, she felt unloved and, perhaps, unlov- able. In The Land of Little Rain she mentions that she possesses "a poor body" (106). Later in life she described herself as "under the average height, not well filled out, with the slightly sallow pallor of the malaria country." She similarly confessed, even more intimately, that Jennie, her sister who died in 1878, Vas the only one who ever unselfishly loved" her.11 Given these features of her personal experience, it is not surpris- ing that in The Land of Little Rain she identifies emotionally with the desert terrain, its "thirsty soil," its "land of lost rivers, with little in it to love," that "cries for" a redemptive rain (5-6) . Typically, Austin identifies with the "demoniac yuccas," which form "tormented, thin forests" of "unhappy growth" in "a lonely land" (10-13). The words cries, demoniac , tormented , unhappy , and lonely indicate Austin's tendency to project human, specifically her own, sentience and emotion upon the landscape in The Land of Little Rain. Such expressions of emotional coloration abound in her book and defy any critical claims for her objectivity or reliance upon descriptive "details to exercise their own energies."12 And these autobiographical traces merge with a second indication of Austin's failure as a documentary artist: her tendency to anthropomorphize her descriptions. In her book, animals are "hill- folk," "foolish people," "little people" (28, 34, 138); meadowlarks nest "unhappily" or "pitifully" (15); coyotes make a "dolorous whine" or seem "ashamed" (29, 55); buzzards are "full of a crass and simple pride" (52); and mountain streams are like human "tears" (205). Altering the figures of nature rhetorically in this manner may seem in one sense to elevate (possibly in Native American fashion) the status of the land and the animals beyond social convention. Yet in another sense this procedure obliterates their distinctiveness from humanity. Such obliteration of difference, in contrast to what an ideal documen- tary method presumably would emphasize, becomes in effect an act of</page><page sequence="7">William J. Scheick 43 appropriation by means of perspective. Austin, in short, unconsciously resorts to a form of colonization of the land. This is, perhaps, an unexpected development, given the Preface of The Land of Little Rain. In the Preface Austin explicitly remarks her general avoidance of names found in geographies (vii) . In contrast, she reports the names Native Americans have attributed to various places; these names "always beautifully fit" the site and do "not originate in the poor human desire for perpetuity" (viii) . However, when Austin says, "by this fashion of naming I keep faith with the land and annex to my own estate a very great territory" (ix), her metaphor of annexation is telling. The word annex conveys a nuance that conflicts with her intention to separate her own spiritual appreciation of nature from others' material exploitation of the landscape. In this instance, Austin's analogy is unfor- tunate. It implicitly insists that the way of the spirit is akin to, not really different from or even opposed to, the way of proprietary colonization. Although Austin explicitly deplores the subjection of nature to the proprietary human self, her use of the word annex rhetorically replicates this behavior; for it territorially fences in, rather than emancipates, the transcendent.13 Whenever Austin alters the figures of nature rhetorically (by autobiographizing and anthropomorphizing) she annexes the land- scape through a verbal act akin to proprietary naming by colonizers. She seizes metaphorically what has been resistant to her metaphysically. The language of anthropomorphism and autobiography confiscates the land through a rhetorical figuration that amounts to a dis-figurement of what is Other. When Austin linguistically displaces what is objectively outside the self through a language of subjective appropriation - through a rhetorical dis-figurement - she in effect reenacts the human disfigure- ment of the landscape that she specifically decries in her book. Austin may denounce both mental acts of naming and physical acts of violence against nature; but her rhetorical dis-figurement replicates the "human occupancy of greed and mischief' that leads to "disfigurement," that leaves a "mark on the field" that "banishe[s]" the wild (60, 128, 131). Such physical disfigurement, like Austin's rhetorical dis-figurement, reveals an "obsess[ion] with [one's] own importance in the scheme of things" (281). It does not signify one's submission to the universal. The universal mattered to Austin throughout her life. As her letters testify, she marvelled over such mystical incidents as the commu- nication between her daughter and a dead playmate. Especially impor-</page><page sequence="8">44 Western American Literature tant were her own "singularly vivid impression [s]." In 1917, she spoke of these impressions as "something like a free verse poem, in rather ob- scure imagery." This, she noted further, "is almost always the way fore- knowledge comes to me."14 During the writing of her first book, we may accordingly surmise, Austin apparently hoped to recover (in some sense) the sort of mystical rapture she occasionally knew during her childhood and later felt she had lost in the desert. Such sublime occasions, however, tend to be moments of confiscation. They tend to be experienced as emanations from the margins of thought, from some seemingly anonymous exteriority beyond consciousness. These rare junctures of transfigured insight,, as Augustine's Confessions paradigmatically suggests, are gener- ally perceived as something that happens to one, not something one deliberately seeks out. As her comments on foreknowledge indicate, Austin recognized this requirement of passivity. Nevertheless, her long- ing for the experience had become too self-conscious during her travels in the desert and during her recollections in her first book. Austin could not recuperate, by the force of her conscious thought, such mystical moments. Austin's ostensible ideal of sympathy for and submission to the universal did not guarantee her mystical fusion with nature either as an Emersonian transparency or even, secondarily, as an objective observer of nature. If The Land of Little Rain thematically insists upon the impossi- bility of being a mystic, it aesthetically discloses, as well, the failure of a mere recorder. Throughout The Land of Little Rain , Austin fails as an objective reporter. She instead remains a lonely outsider delimited by her subjectivity. As an outsider, her insistent, unfulfilled search for divine assimilation finally dramatizes only its own subjective frustration. In The Land of Little Rain, this drama of frustration includes the transfor- mation of an ideal into its abjured opposite. The sympathetic abandon- ment of self to sempiternal "nature" becomes the selfs dis-figuring appropriation of an otherwise metaphysically resistant natural land- scape.15</page><page sequence="9">William J.

In his later career Emerson revised his earlier position by taking into account what he, too, came to feel as a resistance to the sort of pure communion with nature that he had earlier celebrated. Commentary on Austin generally alludes to the influence of Transcendentalism on her thought, which is succinctly noted in Esther Lanigan Stineman's statement that "Emerson remained a model for Mary's own work" (Mary Austin: Song of a Maverick [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1989], p. 12). See also, "The Feel of the Purpose- ful Earth," New Mexico Quarterly 1 (1931): 17-33, in which Henry Smith traces several themes in Austin's work that were nurtured by Transcendentalist tradition; and A Critical Study of the Writings of Mary Hunter Austin (New York: Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, New York University, 1941), in which Dudley Wynn suggests that Austin departed from systematic Transcendentalism. 9. That Austin's narrative voice emerges as an imposing presence, like that of the characters in her books, is remarked by J. Wilkes Berry, "Characterization in Mary Austin's Southwest Works," Southwestern American Literature 2 (1972) : 1 19-24. 10. The irresolute shifts in viewpoint raise difficulties with the suggestion that Austin clearly identifies with, exalts, and aesthetically replicates the "communal</page><page sequence="10">46 Western American Literature rather than [the] defensively isolated": A.

Austin's state of mind is also suggested in her dedication of The Ijind of Little Rain to Eve Lummis, "the comfortress of unsuccess." Despite her misgivings, her book was critically well-received (Stineman, p. 74). That Austin used an "aesthetic of repetition" to "recover the mother," to empower the "maternal past" as especially represented by Seyavi, is observed by Elizabeth Ammons, Conflicting Stories : American Women Writers at the Turn into the Twentieth Century (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991), pp. 91-99. 12.
