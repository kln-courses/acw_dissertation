Weeks Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, both the promise and the threat of technocratic production methods have been recognized. The promise is well known and celebrated in most economics textbooks. This halidom of growing material wealth due to increasingly technical pro- duction has, lamentably, a darker side. Even Adam Smith, who wrote enthusiastically of the gains from the division of labor in his example of a pin factory, recognized some of the negative aspects of production using the division of labor. The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple opera- tions, of which the effects too are, perhaps, always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exact his understanding or to exer- cise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exer- tion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become.... His dexterity at his own particular trade seems, in this manner, to be acquired at the expense of his intellectual, social, and martial virtues. But in every improved and civilized society this is the state into which the labouring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must necessarily fall, unless some government takes some pains to prevent it [Smith 1937, pp. 734-35].

Weeks Marx got to the nub of the matter when he wrote: John Stuart Mill says in his Principles of Political Economy: "It is ques- tionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day's toil of any human being." That is, however, by no means the aim of the capitalist's application of machinery. Like every other increase in the productiveness of labour, machinery is intended to cheapen com- modities, and, by shortening that portion of the working day in which the labourer works for himself, to lengthen the other portion that he gives without an equivalent, to the capitalist. In short, it is a means for producing surplus-value [Marx 1906, p. 405]. Marx felt that this application of machinery to production, while success- ful in lowering labor costs for the firm, would exacerbate those pressures which eventually would lead to the fall of the capitalist economy. The two aspects of this dualism must be understood in order to dis- cuss the reactions of modern capitalist economies to technologically advanced production methods. This article attempts to show how tech- nology, in combination with U.S. capitalism, has led to some specific labor market structures. These structures limit and oppress some workers and some firms, while serving the interests of other workers and firms. There are limits to pretentiousness, so no attempt is made to extend the analysis beyond the present. Capitalist Ideology Beyond the political reasons, there exist compelling economic or tech- nocratic rationales for the widespread acceptance of an ideology which supports the status quo in a technically advanced capitalist economy. Marx gives one reason for the necessity of a dominant capitalist ideol- ogy: "As the number of cooperating labourers increases, so too does their resistance to the domination of capital, and with it, the necessity for capital to overcome this resistance by counter pressure" [Marx 1906, p. 363]. A second reason for the dominance of capitalist ideol- ogy which stems from technology was discussed by Thorstein Veblen: "The machine process pervades modern life and dominates it in a mechanical sense. Its dominance is seen in the enforcement of precise mechanical measures and adjustments and the reduction of all manner of things, purposes and acts, necessities, conveniences and amenities of life, to standard units" [Veblen 1927, p. 306]. This domination is not, then, only extended to the citizen qua worker, but to society at large. It is perhaps of even more significance that "the machine throws out</page><page sequence="3">The Technology of Production 555 anthropomorphic habits of thought. It compels the adaptation of the workman to his work, rather than the adaptation of the work to the workman" [Veblen 1927, p. 310]. Responsibility is surrendered, except for a clearly defined portion of the economic process assigned to each worker. From this, a vision begins to form concerning the structure of technocratic society. A key to this structure is the "expert." Professional specialists "assume authoritative influence over even the most seemingly personal aspects of life: sexual behavior, child-rearing, mental health, recreation, etc. In the technocracy everything aspires to become purely technical, the subject of professional attention" [Roszak 1968, p. 7]. People in a technocratic society are subject to a wide range of influences pressuring conformity to the requirements of technology. This pressure, this need to conform, may help explain the lack of acceptance of any ideology critical of the status quo among Americans in general. Class Conflict An important element to consider when discussing the effects of automation is its effect on labor-management relations. If class is defined functionally, then class conflict becomes a viable and important concept. Traditional economic theory, in general, ignores this concept, and pre- sumes a basic harmony of interests within the economy. This harmonious view is supported by the marginal productivity theory of income distri- bution. If, as hypothesized by that theory, each input to a productive process receives only the value of its contribution to the final output, then any analysis of conflict between different inputs-say, capital and labor-is misguided. In this way, traditional economics tends to ignore class and class conflict. It is interesting to note, however, that when the world is viewed from a perspective other than traditional economic theory, class conflict often is an explicitly recognized phenomenon. For example, the first page of a textbook on labor law by Charles 0. Gregory, a law professor, states: "The ancient struggle between capital and labor now travels under a new name-the conflict between management and organized unions" [Gregory 1961, p. 13]. It seems, therefore, that class conflict can appear, unless, as in orthodox theory, it is assumed away. If class is functionally defined, then people belong to an economic class because of their objective relationship to the economic process. Accordingly, those people who depend upon wage labor as their primary income source belong to the class of workers, or labor. All others belong to the class of capitalists, or capital. Almost everyone in the economy can be classified into one of these objective economic classes.' Class con-</page><page sequence="4">556 Gregory C. Weeks flict can arise in at least two contexts. Subjective class conflict occurs when one economic class consciously and subjectively closes ranks and actively opposes the interests and aims of the other. Objective class con- flict, which generally is being discussed here, occurs when the classes oppose one another while acting in their self-interest, without any con- sciousness or realization that a class-based conflict exists. The idea of class conflict is an old one in economic thought. Although recognized by Adam Smith, the most influential figure in the development of this concept is certainly Karl Marx. Basing his work on a labor theory of value, Marx divides the output of labor into two parts. The first can be viewed as that portion of the workday necessary to produce the worker's wage. Marx calls this necessary labor. "During the second period of the labour-process, that in which his labour is no longer necessary labour, the workman, it is true, labours, expends labour power; but his labour, being no longer necessary labour, he creates no value for himself. He creates surplus value which, for the capitalist, has all the charms of a creation out of nothing" [Marx 1906, p. 240]. Marx contends, therefore, that the worker produces both the value equivalent of his wage and the capitalist's profits. Class conflict arises from the appropriation of the product of surplus labor by the capitalist. The labor theory of value introduces an ethical element. Labor produces -and deserves-all the value of a product, but is cheated out of some of it by the structure of capitalistic economies. The labor theory of value no longer is a part of traditional orthodox economics. Economic theory has moved from this real or objective value theory to the abstract market value theory. Even in this modern value context, however, Marxian class conflict may occur. As Joan Robinson points out,2 that conflict in the modern capitalist world is a disagreement over the surplus that arises within the firm, regardless of its source. In other words, Marx's ethical argument has been expurgated. Robinson's model of class conflict is assumed and used throughout this article, that is, the modern form of class conflict consisting of labor-management struggles over the surplus arising within the firm. Thus defined, class conflict has always played a role in the develop- ment of labor market institutions. Particularly over the last fifty years, neither labor nor capital has been able to dictate the morphology of labor markets. These structures have evolved from the interplay of class conflict and other historical forces. Notable among these are the con- tinual increase in the application of advanced technology to business production and the persistence of poverty among some identifiable</page><page sequence="5">The Technology of Production 557 groups in the economy. These two phenomena are related, which is most clearly understood when viewed in terms of segmented labor market structures. The Dual Labor Market The requirements of machine production have been influential in the development of contemporary economic structures. It is axiomatic for evolutionary economics to consider institutions such as labor market structures as the outcome of a historical process involving the rational responses of economic entities to their economic and social situations. A relatively recent [Gordon 1972, pp. 43-44] development in labor eco- nomics has been to recognize the segmented nature of the macro labor market. It seems obvious that all workers do not compete with one another for every job, but segmented labor market theories imply much more than the idea that dentists and plumbers are noncompeting groups. Typically, such theories bifurcate labor markets into primary and secondary segments. Other divisions are possible, desirable, and even fruitful [Harrison and Sum 1979, p. 698], but the "stylized fact" of a dualistic labor market captures the essence of the structure. The primary labor market consists of jobs which "possess several of the following traits: high wages, good working conditions, employment stability and job security, equity and due process in the administration of work rules, and chances for advancement" [Piore 1970, p. 55]. Jobs in the secondary labor market "tend to involve low wages, poor working conditions, considerable variability in employment, harsh and often arbi- trary discipline, and little opportunity to advance" [Piore 1970, p. 55]. Perhaps the most important element in the dual labor market theories is the assumed immobility between the sectors. Furthermore, "the dual labor market . .. implies . .. that the poor are separated from the non- poor not only in the negative sense of exclusion from activities and insti- tutions to which the non-poor have access, but also in the positive sense that they have economic value where they are; that, in other words, there are groups actively interested in the perpetration of poverty" [Piore 1970, p. 59]. If these groups-those persons interested in the perpetra- tion of poverty and the poor themselves-can be identified as being of different economic classes, a version of class conflict begins to emerge. Without that implication of class conflict, dual labor market theories merely divide jobs into "good" and "bad" categories-neither a very interesting nor substantive contribution.</page><page sequence="6">558 Gregory C. Weeks The Primary Labor Market The primary labor market contains those jobs which might be classi- fied as "good." Workers holding them tend to be more highly skilled, educated, and paid than others. Perhaps the most definitive characteris- tic of primary workers is their high degree of job stability. They tend to be insulated from the effects of the business cycle and, accordingly, experience lower than average levels of unemployment during recessions. Even when laid off, primary workers usually await rehire by the same firm. Various institutional arrangements facilitate this process, the best known being unemployment insurance. Any labor market-dual or otherwise-consists of both supply and demand sides, and it is instruc- tive to look at these two sides of the primary labor market in some detail. It seems crucial to examine the type of firm which requires a stable work force. The Firm. A worker in the primary labor market is generally em- ployed by what Robert Averitt calls the "center firms." These are large in size and influence. [Their] organizations are corporate and bureaucratic; . . . production processes are vertically integrated; . . . activ- ities are diversified into many industries, regions, and nations. Financial support is readily available from both internal and external sources. Firms in the large economy serve national and international markets, using technologically progressive systems of production and distribution. The affairs of such enterprises are conducted with a view to survival in perpetuity as they meet economic crises with successive strategies of firm expansion [Averitt 1968, p. 7]. These center firms correspond to those in J. K. Galbraith's "planning sector." Galbraith recognizes that "organization goes hand in hand with technical advance" [Galbraith 1973, p. 38]. As firms become more com- plex, and production more technical, they are required to protect their large investments in capital and organization. Such a firm seeks "to con- trol the social environment in which it functions-or any part which impinges upon it" [Galbraith 1973, p. 39]. This social environment cer- tainly includes prices and costs. "Decisive costs must also be under control or so managed that adverse movements can be offset by the controlled prices" [Galbraith 1973, p. 39]. The center (or planning system) firm need not necessarily minimize these decisive costs so much as predict them. The need for stable and predictable labor relations is obvious. This need for continuity is frequently fulfilled by formal bureaucratic</page><page sequence="7">The Technology of Production 559 sets of rules covering virtually all phases of labor relations. Not all em- ployers in the primary labor market have these formalized rules, but the economic rationale for them warrants the assumption that they are prevalent. These formalized labor relations make up the structure known as the internal labor market, which can be defined as "an administrative unit, such as a manufacturing plant, within which the pricing and alloca- tion of labor is governed by a set of administrative rules and procedures" [Doeringer and Piore 1971, p. 12]. The internal market is insulated from the external (general) labor market by administrative rules. "These two markets are interconnected, however, and movement between them occurs at certain job classifica- tions which constitute ports of entry and exit to and from the internal labor market. The remainder of the jobs within the internal labor market are filled by the promotion and transfer of workers who have already gained entry. Consequently, these jobs are shielded from the direct in- fluences of competitive forces in the external market" [Doeringer and Piore 1971, p. 12]. The specific detail of any single internal labor market arrangement is determined by labor and management as well as by cus- tom and tradition. Both labor and management may view the internal labor market as being beneficial to their interests. The benefits to the firm are twofold. First, there is the need for con- tinuity in labor relations in a technologically advanced and "immortal" business firm. Such continuity is achieved by developing internal labor markets which deal with labor administratively using fixed rules. Second, the cost of replacing workers is reduced.3 More technically advanced production methods require increased skill specificity. As that skill spe- cificity increases, so too do replacement costs. To lower these, center firms encourage job stability to reduce the number of replacements. Internal labor market arrangements, then, are perhaps the most common means by which center firms deal with their need for stable, continuous, and predictable labor relations. The Worker. From the worker's perspective also, an internal labor market may yield benefits [Doeringer and Piore 1971, p. 28]. These mainly take the form of increased job security and known job advance- ment ladders. A major aspect is the "association of such markets with equity and due process" [Doeringer and Piore 1971, p. 29]. This attri- bute protects workers from arbitrary and capricious treatment. Because the characteristics of a given internal labor market are usually well known to the workers, they generally know of the possibilities, range, and likelihood of job advancement. Some key dimensions may also be determined by the employee bargaining unit. When craft unionism pre-</page><page sequence="8">560 Gregory C. Weeks vails, the internal labor market will encompass that craft; when the col- lective bargaining unit encompasses a plant or factory, the internal labor market will have similar bounds. An important feature of internal labor markets is that they provide workers with some degree of insulation from cyclical forces. Bureaucratic procedures may add costs to the process of laying off workers, so even the most rational firms may be less likely to discharge workers during a recession. Such insulation may exist even in the absence of internal labor markets, for example, when the firm considers labor a fixed cost [Oi 1962, pp. 538-55]. Labor, as a quasi-fixed factor, will not be hired (or fired) immediately in response to a change in labor market conditions. Firms have an investment in the workers (their specific training) which they seek to protect. So long as workers have job-specific skills or train- ing, they will be protected from competitive labor market forces either by the development of an internal labor market, or by their entrenchment as a quasi-fixed factor. Occasionally, even in the absence of such skills, insulation may occur. For example, in some industries a strong union operates, even though most workers are relatively unskilled. Through clever and vigorous use of the union's monopoly powers, these workers may exact the same con- sideration from the firm as highly skilled workers. The key is the firm's need for uninterrupted and stable labor. The Secondary Labor Market The secondary labor market, composed of those workers who do not have access to primary jobs, typically consists of low wage, routinized, and low skill jobs. Firms frequently are on the "periphery." Typically managed by one or perhaps a few hardy entrepreneurs, the periphery firm is tied to the human life cycle. When its founder dies, the business often lies mortally wounded. Usually serving a local market, periphery firms' profit depends as much on cutting costs as on expand- ing sales. Should the market expand too much, one of the large center firms might find it worthwhile locating in the area. The periphery busi- nessman is customarily in business to make a living, not to expand his assets. His traditional economic goal is to become a small success. In the periphery economy, a penny saved is still a penny earned [Averitt 1968, p. 8]. Secondary market workers may work for center firms, but their employer usually is part of the periphery economy. Firms in secondary labor mar- kets do not act like large-asset bureaucratic operations. When a large</page><page sequence="9">The Technology of Production 561 corporation participates in the secondary labor market, it acts as if it were a smaller, periphery firm.4 There are characteristics common to most secondary jobs. From the firm's viewpoint, secondary workers generally can be considered homo- geneous with respect to skill levels and anonymous. Secondary jobs re- quire virtually no specific skills. Low wages and low social status are hallmarks of secondary employment, as perceived by both the worker and by society. Unlike the primary labor market, in the secondary labor market the worker has alternatives to participation in the wage-labor process which do not lower his status [Harrison 1972, pp. 137-47]; con- sequently, there is no great stigma attached to unemployment. Alternatives to wage labor, on the supply side, combined with the firm's indifference as between workers, on the demand side, have helped to develop instability in the secondary labor market. Because jobs are unskilled, employers neither expect nor reward stable work habits. Similarly, employees neither expect nor receive any benefits from job stability. The result has been low skill requirements, low wages, and unstable work habits. "This pattern of instability fits into a more general pattern of life in the ghetto. Secondary workers tended to continue their instability by habit or instinct even in those rare instances where stability might have mattered" [Gordon 1972, p. 45]. Piore states that this in- stability is "the most important characteristic distinguishing primary from secondary jobs" [Piore 1970, p. 55]. Also, "insofar as secondary workers are barred from primary jobs by real qualifications, it is generally their inability to show up for work regularly and on time. Secondary em- ployers are far more tolerant of lateness and absenteeism, and many secondary jobs are of such short duration that these do not matter" [Piore 1970, pp. 55-56]. Thus, the behavior of secondary workers rele- gates them to secondary jobs, and that behavior is induced and sup- ported by the characteristics of the market. Secondary workers also often live among others in similar situations and with similar behavioral pat- terns. Thus, there is positive feedback reinforcing unstable work habits. On the one hand, such behavior is supported by employer expectations; on the other, it is reinforced by the culture and life-style of the worker's home environment. As the foregoing suggests, the secondary labor mar- ket is difficult to leave once a worker has participated for any extended period. How are workers allocated to primary or secondary labor markets? An adequate explanation should show why a particular worker enters which market, as well as what accounts for the persistence of dual labor markets.</page><page sequence="10">562 Gregory C. Weeks Causes of Labor Market Segmentation Education A common belief in the United States is that education is the means by which any person, through diligence and hard work, can improve his station in life. The view persists despite studies showing that the public subsidy to education is regressive with respect to parents' income level.5 Samuel Bowles contends that the U.S. educational system distributes educational opportunities regressively with respect to social class. This helps to explain the intergenerational stability of the social class struc- ture. "Unequal schooling reproduces the social division of labor. Chil- dren whose parents occupy positions at the top of the occupational hierarchy receive more years of schooling than working class children. Both the amount and the content of their education greatly facilitates their movement into positions similar to their parents" [Bowles 1971, p. 11]. With the development of modern technology, and the technocracy, the possession of the proper credentials has become increasingly impor- tant in obtaining a good job.6 If these credentials do, in fact, guarantee that the holder has acquired specific skills, knowledge, or abilities, and if the opportunities for earning any set of credentials are equitably dis- tributed, then the liberal meritocracy can be realized. However, creden- tials do not guarantee competence, and the opportunities for earning them are not equally distributed. With respect to the allocation of labor be- tween the primary and secondary labor markets, the inequity in acquir- ing credentials is the more important factor, but the relevance of what has been learned also is an issue. For example, many jobs require a bac- calaureate degree, but what was learned in acquiring the degree has little application to the job. The degree requirement is often an inexpensive, if not always accurate, screening device for employers. Cristopher Jencks and David Riesman have found not only that the proportion of children who enter college is dependent upon their parents' social class, but also that this dependence has increased over time. They find that lower class youth are not attending college relatively as often as upper class youth, and not even as often as lower class youths of the 1920s. Similarly, middle and upper class youths are continuing to attend college more frequently [Jencks and Riesman 1968, p. 95]. The U.S. system of allocating educational opportunities can be viewed as block- ing, not encouraging, upward social mobility by students from poor families. If educational opportunity is, in fact, based on social class, and</page><page sequence="11">The Technology of Production 563 if primary labor market jobs require credentials earned (at least partly) through education, then the class structure has become largely hereditary and the occupational structure somewhat rigid. Discrimination A second source of the distribution and persistence of labor market segmentation is discrimination, by which is meant here any action based on such nonjob related characteristics as race, sex, age, and national origin and which results in economic harm. Discrimination can take many forms and is not limited to differences in remuneration for work. According to our definition, discrimination can affect a range of variables in addition to rates of pay. These include the probability of being hired or fired or the likelihood of promotion and training; even ability and productivity may become endogenous given this relatively broad defini- tion. It is an institutional as well as an individual problem and is not handled adequately by a neoclassical approach. Discrimination automatically allocates some workers to secondary labor markets, which has two economic effects: It limits the supply of primary workers and adds to the supply of secondary workers. That is, discrimination tightens primary markets and adds slack to secondary ones. This tends to widen the wage differential between the two markets. Behavior The third determinant of participation in the primary or secondary labor market is work habits, which are partially related to social class. Workers who come from a secondary labor market family tend to adopt the attitudes and behavior patterns consistent with employment in that market. Consequently, they are likely to find jobs there. Similarly, a worker from a primary labor market background will acquire attitudes more consistent with primary employment. This implies that the children of secondary workers are likely to become secondary workers, and the children of primary workers are likely to become primary workers. In addition, once workers are entrenched in the secondary sector, they are not qualified for primary employment due to the unstable work habits encouraged by the secondary labor market. As job instability becomes a part of their life-style, secondary workers become the chronically poor and underemployed, and movement into the primary labor market be- comes more and more remote.</page><page sequence="12">564 Gregory C. Weeks Class Interest The institutions which define and perpetuate segmented labor markets are teleological in nature. This aspect is best understood in the frame- work of class interest. In a dual labor market setting, there are four groups belonging to two objective economic classes. These are the pri- mary and secondary firms (capitalists), and the primary and secondary workers. Tensions develop among all four as they all attempt to act in their class interests. The institutions which form dual labor markets best serve the interests of dual labor market firms. These firms-members of the planning sector -benefit most from stable work forces. In addition, the very existence of the secondary labor market-where unemployment is concentrated- disciplines the primary work force. High unemployment among second- ary workers tends to lessen militancy among primary workers as they see the overall unemployment rate increase. This division in the labor force also effectively blocks the development of widespread subjective class consciousness by workers. In other words, the development of dual labor markets has served the class interests of the technologically ad- vanced primary firms. Primary labor market workers also benefit from the existence of dual labor market institutions. Their "bread and butter" unionism has been successful in attaining good incomes, improved working conditions, and even an increased role within the firm. It is, then, the primary workers and especially the primary firms that benefit from the poverty and under- employment associated with dual labor markets. For primary workers, these benefits do not resolve many of the problems associated with tech- nological production. Workers in general are still subject to the forces first pointed out by Smith and Marx. Worker dissatisfaction and aliena- tion are still widespread, despite high wages and the acceptance of the capitalist ideology. Dual labor market approaches unmask the rationale and the ration- ality of poverty in modern industrial capitalism. As things are now structured, there simply are not enough good jobs to go around. Ration- ing these out in the interests of big business is an important function of labor market institutions generally, and of dual labor market structures in particular. Notes 1. Objective economic classes are defined with no consideration of the class member's identification with the class. For example, a white-collar worker</page><page sequence="13">The Technology of Production 565 may be in the working class because his income is derived from wages, but he may consider himself a part of management. Subjective economic classes, in contrast, are defined by how the individual identifies himself. The white-collar worker mentioned above is not, subjectively, a part of the working class. The concepts are further discussed in [Gordon 1972, pp. 57-60]. 2. See [Robinson and Rowthom 1974]. 3. Replacement costs can be separated into three major categories: recruit- ment, screening, and training. These involve the cost of attracting candi- dates for a job, of assessing their qualifications, and of assimilating the new employee into the new position. As the required skill specificity for a job increases, all three aspects of worker replacement costs tend to increase. To lower them, center firms encourage job stability among workers. 4. For example, West Coast fruit growers cannot be characterized as small- scale operations, but the state of the art of fruit harvesting forces them into a low wage and labor-intensive labor market with an unstable work force. See, for example [Fisher 1953]. 5. See, for example [Sexton 1964], [Hansen and Weisbrod 1969a] and [Hansen and Weisbrod 1969b]; and [Jencks and Riesman 1968]. 6.
