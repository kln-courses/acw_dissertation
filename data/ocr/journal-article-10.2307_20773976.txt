Phylogenetics of Orchideae based on coxl intron sequences Contribution of mitochondrial coxl intron sequences to the phylogenetics of tribe Orchideae (Orchidaceae): Do the distribution and sequence of this intron in orchids also tell us something about its evolution?

Inda, lainda@unizar.es Abstract In this paper, we use the mitochondrial region coxl to assess the usefulness of this marker in addressing evolutionary relationships within the tribe Orchideae. Despite the low overall variation uncovered in this region, one good phylogenetic marker was identified. A large group I intron was shared across subtribe Orchidinae and some species of Habenariinae sensu Dressier. The clades identified in the coxl tree were weakly supported, but consistent with previous studies based on nuclear ribosomal spacers (nrlTS). Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis of the combined coxlllTS data matrix allowed us to highly improve the resolution of the ITS-only analysis and confirm several previously controversial relationships. A second purpose of this study was to analyse the evolution of the group I coxl intron in Orchideae. This intron has a patchy distribution in angiosperms that has been claimed to be mostly due to horizontal transfer events. Our results suggest that, despite the differences observed in the co-conversion tracts in the tribe, vertical transfer is more consistent with the observed phylogenetic trees. Keywords co-conversion tracts; coxl; horizontal and vertical transfer; mitochondrial DNA; Orchideae; Orchidinae INTRODUCTION Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been extensively used in animal phylogenetics (e.g, Zardoya &amp; Meyer, 1996); how ever, the low rates of base substitution generally found in this organellar genome in plants have made its use much less wide spread in the plant kingdom, especially at lower taxonomic lev els (e.g. Palmer &amp; Herbon, 1988; Chase &amp; Fay, 2009). Nucleo tide substitution rates in plant mitochondria were estimated as less than one-third of those for plastid DNA (Wolfe &amp; al, 1987) and up to 100 times lower than in vertebrate mitochon dria (Palmer &amp; al, 2000), although several exceptions have been detected (Laroche &amp; al, 1997; Palmer &amp; al, 2000; Cho &amp; al, 2004). Consequently, mitochondrial sequences usually are significantly less informative for molecular phylogenetic analyses of relatively closely related species than plastid or nuclear sequences. Also, mitochondrial DNA in plants exhibits dynamic evolutionary patterns that make the examination of large stretches of DNA difficult (Palmer &amp; al, 2000; Sanchez Puerta &amp; al, 2008). Despite these drawbacks, mitochondrial DNA has often been used in phylogenetics with good results (e.g, Nickrent &amp; al, 2004; Freudenstein &amp; Chase, 2001; Cam eron, 2009). Also, structural characters such as gene arrange ments, intron content and sequence duplications have been proven to be useful as markers in plant molecular phylogenetic studies (Cho &amp; Palmer, 1999). Cytochrome oxidase is a highly conserved multi-sub unit protein complex of the inner mitochondrial membrane. It is present in all oxygen-respiring eukaryotes given its involvement in the phosphorylation pathway. In plants, three of its subunits are typically encoded by the mitochondrial genes coxl, cox2 and cox39 whereas the remaining subunits are encoded by nuclear genes. A lot of attention has been paid to the evolution and structure of the coxl gene in both animals and plants during the last decades (e.g, Lunt &amp; al, 1996; Sanchez-Puerta &amp; al, 2008). In animals, coxl has been highlighted as rapidly evolving and, therefore, highly use ful in phylogenetic reconstruction. Also, this region has been adopted as universal DNA barcode in the animal kingdom (Hebert &amp; al, 2003). The scenario is completely different in plants, where coxl is considered to evolve too slowly to be extensively used in phylogenetics or as a barcode (Chase &amp; Fay, 2009). The structure of coxl is also strikingly different in plants and animals. One important feature of this structure in plants is the presence of a group I intron that exhibits a patchy distribution across fungi, green algae, bryophytes and angiosperms (Ohta &amp; al, 1993; Palmer &amp; al, 2000). Group I introns are considered mobile genetic elements that are trans mitted laterally as well as vertically (reviewed in Dujon, 1989; Cho &amp; Palmer, 1999). Lateral (or horizontal) gene transfer is the movement of genetic material between two organisms by any process other than descent. Conversely, vertical transfer occurs when genetic material is incorporated through a direct ancestor-descendant relationship. Lateral transfer events have been suggested for different plant groups, especially Araceae (e.g, Cho &amp; Palmer, 1999) and Rafflesiales (Nickrent &amp; al, 2004). Within the latter, different events of horizontal gene transfer between host and parasite have been suggested for 1053</page><page sequence="2">Inda &amp; al. Phylogenetics of Orchideae based on coxl intron sequences TAXON 59 (4) August 2010: 1053-1064 the family Apodanthaceae. Thus, according to Barkman &amp; al. (2007), parasitic plants might act as vectors for lateral transfer. Both the origin of the coxl intron and mechanisms that explain its distribution in the angiosperms (vertical vs. hori zontal transfer) have been debated during the last few decades. As regards its origin, current data suggest that fungi are the source of the angiosperm coxl intron through an old event of between-mitochondria horizontal transfer (Vaughn &amp; al, 1995; Cusimano &amp; al, 2007). However, sampling in fungi is sparse, and the biochemical basis of this transfer is not well understood (Cusimano &amp; al, 2007). As regards the mechanisms governing the distribution of the intron, several authors proposed a domi nance of between-angiosperm horizontal transfers (e.g, Rich ardson &amp; Palmer, 2007; Barkman &amp; al, 2007; Sanchez-Puerta &amp; al, 2008), whereas others suggest that vertical transfer and intron loss are the dominant processes (Cusimano &amp; al, 2007; Goremykin &amp; al, 2009). Two different elements have been used as arguments for and against horizontal transfer of the coxl intron in angio sperms: (1) the differences observed between the coxl intron I tree and organismal trees in different groups of angiosperms and (2) the differentiation among the co-conversion tracts ob served in different species, even within families (e.g, Cusi mano &amp; al, 2007; Sanchez-Puerta &amp; al, 2008). Co-conversion tracts arise as a result of the group I intron insertion process in intron-lacking genes. This process involves the partial deg radation and subsequent repair of the exonic flanking regions immediately adjacent to the insertion site (Cech, 1990; San chez-Puerta &amp; al, 2008). This degradation and repair causes a transformation in a region, the co-conversion tract (CCT), which can vary widely in length. Co-conversion tracts have been, therefore, defined as "footprints" of transposition events and have been used as historical evidence of intron presence (Cusimano &amp; al, 2007). The potential usefulness of the coxl region, including its group I intron (presence, length and sequence variation) in phylogenetic studies at low levels has not yet been fully explored. Conversely, other mitochondrial introns have been extensively used in phylogenetics during the last decades both between and within families (e.g. Porter &amp; Johnson, 1998). Thus, Freudenstein &amp; Chase (2001) used the nadlb-c intron to clarify phylogenetic relationships within orchids. Their results were consistent with previous molecular studies (Pridgeon &amp; al, 1997; Bateman &amp; al, 2003), but with lower internal (boot strap) support. Our main aims in this study were to: (1) assess the useful ness of the coxl intron as a phylogenetic marker in an important group of orchids (tribe Orchideae sensu Chase &amp; al, 2003; in cluding the former tribe Diseae); for this, we used this region to evaluate the monophyly of tribe Orchideae and circumscription of component subtribes and genera; (2) unravel the intergeneric relationships within this group; and (3) contribute with these results on orchids to the longstanding debate between horizon tal vs. vertical transfer of the coxl intron in angiosperms. To achieve our aims, the coxl results obtained for 108 taxa of tribe Orchideae were compared to and combined with other phylo genetic data from already published nuclear ribosomal ITS sequences, most of them from the research of Pridgeon &amp; al. (1997) and Bateman &amp; al. (2003). Also, a phylogenetic analysis was conducted combining the coxl sequences generated in this study with 39 coxl sequences obtained from other angiosperms (36 monocots and one magnoliid?Peperomia Ruiz &amp; Pav.). These sequences were available in Cho &amp; al. (1998), Cusimano &amp; al. (2007) and Sanchez-Puerta &amp; al. (2008). Finally, an analy sis of the CCTs observed in our sequences was also conducted. MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant material and purification of total DNA. ? Overall, 108 taxa from tribe Orchideae (sensu Chase &amp; al., 2003) were included in the survey. Of these, four belonged to the small sub tribes Disinae and Brownleeinae, whereas 104 taxa belonged to subtribe Orchidinae (sensu Chase &amp; al., 2003), which is by far the most diverse in the group. DNAs were obtained from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, DNA Bank (http://data.kew .org/dnabank/homepage.html). Taxa selected for this study and their vouchers are listed in the Appendix. All vouchers are kept in the K Herbarium. Total genomic DNAs were extracted from silica-dried material following Doyle &amp; Doyle (1987) with the following modifications: DNA was precipitated with 100% ethanol or iso propanol, chilled for at least 24 h at 4?C, pelleted and purified by centrifugation through a CsCl2-ethidium bromide gradient (1.55 g/ml). Finally, dialysis was conducted in sterile double distilled H20 and Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0), and purified DNAs were stored at -80?C until needed. Coxl gene isolation and sequencing. ? Part of the coxl gene including the group I intron and two small exonic (exon 1) flanking regions was directly amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primers coxl-526F, 5-GGACC TGGAATGACTATGCATAG-3', and coxl-1918R, 5'-CCCA CAGTAAACATATGATGAGCCC-3' (Fontana &amp; Savolainen, unpub.). PCR was performed in 25 ml reactions in a Perkin Elmer thermal cycler using the following components: 22 ul ReddyMix (AB-0575; ABgene, Epsom, U.K.) with 1 ul 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 1 ul each primer 0.15 mM. The PCR initial step of 5 min at 94?C was followed by 40 cycles of 94?C for 1 min for DNA denaturation, 53?C for 30 s for primer annealing, and 72?C for 1 min for primer extension, ending with an extension of 7 min at 72?C. Amplified products were purified with NucleoSpin Extract (Macherey-Nagel, Diiren, Germany) or QIAquick (QIAgen, West Sussex, U.K.) silica columns following the manufactur ers' protocols. Cleaned and quantified products were then se quenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing with AmpliTaqDNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems Inc., ABI, Warrington, U.K.) and the PCR primers. GenBank accession numbers for sequences reported here are listed in the Appendix. Sources of gene sequences. ? Both the ITS sequences used in this study and 39 coxl sequences from other angio sperms were downloaded from GenBank; for GenBank acces sions, see Pridgeon &amp; al. (1997) and Bateman &amp; al. (2003) for the ITS and Vaughn &amp; al. (1995), Cho &amp; al. (1998), Cusimano 1054</page><page sequence="3">TAXON 59 (4) August 2010: 1053-1064 Inda &amp; al. Phylogenetics of Orchideae based on coxl intron sequences &amp; al. (2007) and Sanchez-Puerta &amp; al. (2008) for coxl. See also Appendix. Overall, 38 out of 39 coxl sequences downloaded were monocots, and we selected them in order to have a wide representation of this group in the analysis. Phylogenetic analyses. ? Alignments were generated using Clustal X (Chenna &amp; al, 2003). For the analysis, we constructed three datasets: (1) the orchid coxl sequences gen erated in this study; (2) the coxl dataset including the 39 other sequences downloaded from GenBank; and (3) the combined orchid coxl and ITS dataset. All datasets were analyzed with PAUP v.4.0b9 (Swofford, 2000). Disperis lindleyana (subtribe Coryciinae sensu Douzery &amp; al, 1999) was used as outgroup in the analysis of the two first datasets. Outgroup selection was based on the results of Douzery &amp; al. (1999), who showed that this particular genus from tribe Coryciinae occupies the position of sister to a clade composed of subtribes Orchidinae, Disinae and Brownleeinae (sensu Chase &amp; al, 2003). For the third dataset, we used the magnoliid Peperomiapolybotrya Kunth as outgroup given the position occupied by Piperales with respect to the monocots (APG III, 2009). All maximum parsimony searches were conducted using 1000 random addition sequence replicates with all sites equally weighted. Tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping with a limit of 10 trees/step was selected as search method. Internal support and stability of the obtained trees was as sessed by means of equal-weights maximum parsimony boot strap analysis (Felsenstein, 1985; 1000 pseudoreplicates, each consisting of a heuristic search using 1000 random sequence addition replicates). Bayesian analysis was conducted with MrBayes v3.0B4 (Huelsenbeck &amp; Ronquist, 2001). This analysis was conducted with the combined data matrix. This dataset showed the op timal nucleotide substitution model (GTR) conducted with MrModeltest v.2.3 (Nylander, 2004). Bayesian analysis was performed with 1 million generations initiated with random starting tree, sampling of a tree every 100 generations, likeli hood parameters estimated by the program, and sampled points collected prior to stationarity. RESULTS Parsimony analysis of coxl: tribe Orchideae. ? Overall, we obtained coxl sequences for 108 taxa within tribe Orchi deae. For most of these species, the amplified coxl region was 1351 base pair (bp) long, although for some of them the amplicon was only 250-270 bp in length. In the former group, a 1096 bp long intron was detected. The identity between this intron and the one described by Vaughn &amp; al. (1995) in Pep eromia and Cho &amp; al. (1998) in many other angiosperms was assessed by multiple alignment using Clustal X (Chenna &amp; al, 2003). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this intron is detected in species belonging to Orchida ceae (subfamily Orchidoideae). According to Cho &amp; al. (1998), this region is absent in several representatives of subfamily Epidendroideae. Overall, 212 out of 1351 positions in the coxl region are variable (15.7%), of which 122 are potentially parsimony in formative (9%). On average, each position changes 0.32 times in this analysis. The heuristic search conducted on the coxl data matrix found 940 equally most parsimonious trees of 396 steps. The consistency index (CI) was 0.56 and the retention index (RI) was 0.77. The strict consensus tree is shown in Fig. 1. Only twelve nodes of the tree were moderately to strongly supported (bootstrap percentage, BP, &gt;60), and those are the only ones for which BP is depicted in the tree (Fig. 1). A very well supported clade (BP 96) loosely corresponding to subtribe Orchidinae sensu Chase &amp; al, 2003 or to subtribes Orchidinae + Habenariinae sensu Dressier, 1993 can be ob served in the tree. If Holothrix scopularia Rchb. is included in the clade, support falls to 60 BP. The separation between subtribes Orchidinae and Habenariinae (sensu Dressier, 1993) is not clear on the basis of this analysis. Thus, Orchidinae as defined by Dressier (1993) is clearly paraphyletic with Habe nariinae nested within Orchidinae. Within the Orchidinae + Habenariinae clade, the coxl region sequenced fails to pro duce any consistent, well-supported suprageneric groups. Thus, only Gymnadenia (L.) R. Br. (including Nigritella Rich.), rep resented by five species in the analysis, is clearly recovered in the tree. Other groupings that receive moderate to strong support are the Platanthera bifolialclorantha cluster (98 BP), the anthropomorphic group of Orchis (but not Orchis italicd) composed of Orchis (Aceras) anthropophora, O. simia, O. militaris and O. purpurea (99 BP). Neotinea (excluding N. maculata, the type) constitutes a well-supported group (92 BP) separated from Orchis (in which they were previously in cluded). The widespread European taxon, N. maculata groups with the anthropomorphic clade of Orchis, but with BP &lt; 60. Within Ophrys, only the clade composed of O. speculum and O. regis-ferdinandii obtained strong support (99 BP). The 1096 bp coxl group I intron was detected in all species belonging to subtribe Orchidinae (sensu Chase &amp; al., 2003) but also in Holothrix scopularia (Fig. 1) and Satyrium. Also, it is worth noting that taxa possessing the intron grow mostly in Eurasia or the Maghreb, whereas only three sub-Saharan taxa (Brachycorythis, Cynorkis, Stenoglottis) exhibit this fragment. The remaining totally or partially African genera included in the analysis, which belong to other subtribes within Orchideae (Disa, Buttoned), lack the intron. Both the parsimony and the Bayesian analyses yielded similar results. The same clades supported in the parsimony bootstrap results are also supported in the Bayesian analysis, although the support obtained is higher in the latter. Analysis of coxl: monocots. ? We conducted phyloge netic analyses of coxl regions (composed mostly of the intron and short flanking regions) and compared them with angio sperms relationships recovered from larger datasets (Soltis &amp; al., 2000; APG III, 2009). Partial coxl sequences from 144 monocots (including the 108 sequences from tribe Orchideae obtained in this study) were analyzed with parsimony using the magnoliid Peperomia polybotrya as outgroup.

Phylogenetics of Orchideae based on coxl intron sequences the coxl region are variable (17.6%), all of which are potentially parsimony-informative. The heuristic search recovered 740 equally most parsi monious trees of 344 steps long. The CI was 0.46 and the RI was 0.86. The maximum parsimony tree obtained (not shown) recovers the orders within monocots (Asparagales, Alisma tales, Zingiberales) in agreement with monocot trees obtained from other data (APG, 2009). Unfortunately, only sequences from three orders in the monocots could be recovered from GenBank. As regards generic distribution within more densely sampled families (Araceae) our tree only loosely reflects previ ous results obtained by other authors (Cusimano &amp; al., 2007) and with weak support. Exonic co-conversion tracts for coxl in orchids. ? In the case of the coxl intron, a 3' CCT up to 22 nucleotides (nt) in length with 1-8 nt differences can be detected (Fig. 2). All intron-containing orchid coxl genes included in this study exhibit a clearly identifiable 3' CCT that is absent in all the intron-lacking orchids included in the study. Overall, 95 out of 101 intron-bearing orchids included in the study had the same 6+TA co-conversion tract (six nucleotidic differences in the first 18 bases of the CCT plus a TA at the RNA editing site located at positions 21 and 22; Sanchez-Puerta &amp; al., 2008; for co-conversion tract denominations see Cusimano &amp; al., 2007). The only exceptions were: Ophrys iricolor, O. regis ferdinandii, O. insectifera, O. ciliata and Gennaria diphylla, which had a 6 + T co-conversion tract and Habenaria delavayi with a 2+T pattern. The motifs described are completely absent in all intron-less orchids included in this study. Intron-less coxl genes are instead nearly identical in sequence to each other (at least for the region we sequenced), even when different families or orders of angiosperms are compared (Fig. 2). Combined analysis: coxl and ITS. ? The combined matrix included 99 taxa. The coxl sequences employed here were obtained from the same samples as the downloaded ITS se quences (Appendix). The length of the ITS matrix was 744 bp, of which 106 (14.25%o) were variable but uninformative and 433 (48%&gt;) were potentially parsimony informative. The nrlTS matrix had, therefore, 4.4 times more potentially informative sites than the coxl dataset. The maximum parsimony analysis recovered 1768 trees of 2407 steps with a CI of 0.42 and RI of 0.72. These results were almost identical to the ones obtained in Pridgeon &amp; al. (1997) and Bateman &amp; al. (2003). The ITS-cox7 combined matrix had 1969 characters, 213 of which (10.8%) were variable but uninformative and 534 were potentially informative (27%). The 170 shortest trees obtained were 2850 steps, CI = 0.43 and RI = 0.72. The strict consen sus tree obtained is shown in Fig. 3. Bootstrap percentages of moderate to strong support (BP more than 60%&gt;) are indicated above branches. As can be observed comparing Figs. 1 and 3, the phylo genetic tree obtained with the combined dataset is much more resolved than the one obtained with the coxl region alone. This result was expected due to the much greater number of informative positions in the ITS matrix. Also, bootstrap percentages are generally higher in the analyses conducted on the combined data than in the ITS analysis alone (not shown). According to this new analysis, Satyrium is sister to the rest of the tribe Orchideae, which constitutes a monophyletic and clearly differentiated group (91 BP). Subsequently, a clade that roughly corresponds to the old subtribe Habenariinae (sensu Dressier, 1993) is weakly supported (52 BP, not indi cated in the tree). The African genus Brachycorythis is sister to subtribe Orchidinae sensu Dressier with moderate sup port (77 BP). The next diverging clade (66, BP) is composed of Neottianthe plus Amitostigma, which are unambiguously united in the tree (100 BP). The remaining taxa form a large, five-parted polytomy (72 BP) that includes: (1) Traunsteineral Chamorchis (100 BP); (2) the Platanthera clade (including Galearis, Neolindleya, Pseudorchis and Platanthera; 54 BP) plus GymnadenialDactylorhiza (95 BP); (3) a clade including Orchis s.str. (100 BP); (4) the Neotinea s.l. clade (100 BP); and (5) a clade comprising Himatoglossum, Ophrys, Serapias and Anacamptis s.l. (77 BP). Anacamptis (not monophyletic: A. laxiflora and A. palus tris are not supported as members of the group) is grouped with genus Serapias in our trees, although this relationship is poorly supported (61 BP). Also, Ophrys is, according to our data, clearly monophyletic (100 BP). Within it, there are two well-supported groups: the first composed of O. lutea, O.fusca and O. tricolor (94 BP) and the second including O. spruneri, O. araneola, O. aesculapii, O. cretica, O. scolopax and O. apifera (97 BP), loosely reflecting the patterns previously obtained by Devey &amp; al. (2008). Another well-supported genus in our trees is Himantoglossum (99 BP). It is remarkable that Himantoglos sum comperianum (former genus Comperia K. Koch) is sister to the other species of Himantoglossum (100 BP). Orchis, including Aceras (O. anthropophord), also con stitutes a very well supported clade (100 BP). As in Ophrys, there are two groups recovered with high BP: the first including O. anatolica, O. brancifortii, O. quadripunctata, O. sitiata, O. provincialis and O. mascula (100 BP) and a second compris ing O. purpurea, O. militaris, O. simia and O. anthropophora (98 BP). Our results also reflect clear monophyly for Dactylorhiza (95 BP), but fail to recover any well supported groups within the genus, except for the clade composed by D. maculata, D. iberica and D. foliosa (99 BP). Moreover, Gymnadenia (99 BP) is, in our tree, sister to Dactylorhiza (95 BP), with ge nus Nigritella nested within the latter (61 BP). Neolindleya camtschatica is sister to Galearis, although the support for this pairing (54 BP, not shown on the tree) is low. Finally, Pseu dorchis is sister to Platanthera; however, this pair has low bootstrap support (less than 50 BP). The Bayesian analyses (not shown) show a similar pat tern, although the tree is slightly better resolved than the par simony strict consensus. In this tree, the clade Anacamptis/ Serapias is sister to Ophrys with moderate support (0.87 PP). The AnacamptislOphryslSerapias clade is sister to Himanto glossum (0.97 PP).

Phylogenetics of Orchideae based on coxl intron sequences TAXON 59 (4) August 2010: 1053-1064 DISCUSSION Mitochondrial DNA evolution in plants is three and twelve times slower than plastid and nuclear DNA evolution, respec tively (Palmer, 1992). In this study, the coxl group I intron failed to provide a higher rate of variation than other regions of plant mitochondrial DNA that have been sequenced so far in plants (e.g., nadl intron 2, nad5 intron 1; Tsutsumi &amp; al., 2009). According to some authors such as Soltis &amp; Soltis (1998), this low level of variation might be useful for phylogenetic studies at high taxonomic levels. In orchids, this low level of variation had previously been observed for another mitochondrial region, the nadlb-c intron (Freudenstein &amp; Chase, 2001). According to our results the coxl group I intron is not an exception, since the resolution of the trees is low, and most groups show low to moderate bootstrap levels. Among the few well-supported results offered by the coxl only phylogenetic analyses, the clearest is the identification of a clade (characterized by the presence of the intron) that corre sponds to subtribe Orchidinae sensu Chase &amp; al. (2003), includ ing Brachycorythis but excluding Holothrix scopularia. These last two taxa were placed in subtribe Habenariinae by Dressier (1993) but in subtribe Orchidinae by Chase &amp; al. (2003). Our results might indicate a higher than expected differentiation for this African taxon. As regards genus Satyrium, this intron less taxon was included by Chase &amp; al. (2003) in subtribe Or chidinae instead of Satyrinae. However, and according to our results, this genus seems to be molecularly differentiated from Orchidinae. The placement in Chase &amp; al. (2003) for Satyrium have been challenged by other authors for whom "there is no unequivocal evidence for placement of Satyriinae as sister to any of the tribes or subtribes within Orchideae" (Bellstedt &amp; al., 2001; Van der Niet &amp; al., 2005). In our view, the absence of the intron in Satyrium reinforces this idea, but our sampling of taxa in the formerly recognized tribe Diseae is not extensive, so our conclusions must be considered tentative. Few genera are supported by analysis of coxl alone, with the exception of Gymnadenia (BP 98). There are other sup ported clusters of taxa, such as subgeneric groupings in Ophrys, Neotinea, and Platanthera, which have generally been already highlighted by other authors (e.g., the close relationship be tween O. speculum and O. regis-ferdinandii, in Devey &amp; al., 2008). The ITS + coxl combined dataset, however, resulted in a much better supported tree than the one offered by the ITS only analysis conducted by Bateman &amp; al. (2003). Thus, for example, the Platanthera/Gymnadenia/Dactylorhiza clade received less than 50 BP in Bateman &amp; al. (2003), whereas the bootstrap support obtained by this clade in the combined analysis here was higher (63 BP). Also, the sister relationship between Dactylorhiza and Gymnadenia is highly supported in the combined analysis (95 BP), whereas support in the ITS only analysis was only moderate (82 BP; Bateman &amp; al., 2003). Finally, both the ITS results by Bateman &amp; al. (2003) and the coxl intron-only results presented here recovered the same rela tionship between the African taxon Brachycorythis and the rest of subtribe Orchidinae sensu Chase &amp; al. (2003). However, no internal support was obtained in either of them for this relation ship (&gt;50 BP). Again, the combined analysis offered moderate support for this relationship (77 BP). Summarizing, adding coxl sequences to the ITS dataset clearly improved the overall resolution and bootstrap support, helping to enhance our gen eral understanding of higher-level relationships in Orchidinae. Moreover, including markers from different genomes has been suggested as a good strategy to unravel complex evolutionary patterns (e.g., Wendel &amp; Doyle, 1998; Tsutsumi &amp; al, 2009) such as the ones existing among most orchid genera. Combined cox7/ITS. ? The combined coxl/YTS analysis recovered a strongly supported subtribe Orchidinae. More over, a clade composed of species from Satyrium occupied a position sister to subtribe Orchidinae, whereas Disa was sister to the Orchidinae+Satyrium clade (both with 98 BP). Some authors (Chase &amp; al, 2003) placed Satyrium (subtribe Satyriinae) in Orchidinae. On the other hand, Dressier (1993) included Satyriinae as a subtribe of Diseae, and other authors (e.g., Senghas, 1974) have recognized three tribes in Orchi doideae: Orchideae, Diseae and Satyrieae, the last including only Satyrium (monandrous orchids with basitonic anthers). Some authors have also included Pachites Lindl. in Satyriinae (Dressier, 2003), but Bytebier &amp; al. (2008) showed that Pachites is sister to Disinae plus Orchidinae, so the classification in the former Diseae will need adjustments. Also, Van der Niet &amp; al. (2005) showed that the subgenera of Satyrium are not mono phyletic; earlier, Kores &amp; al. (1997) analyzed plastid rbcL data and showed that Diseae were sister to Orchideae, although they only included six species of the tribe. Our combined analysis clearly placed Satyrium as sister to Orchidinae sensu Chase &amp; al. (2003; Fig. 3, 91 BP). How ever, the relative positions occupied by Orchidinae, Satyrium and Disa in our analysis makes impossible to decide whether Satyrium should be included or not in Orchidinae. Samples from additional taxa (especially Pachites) should be included to resolve this conflict; however, the absence of the coxl intron in Satyrium (discussed above) seems to indicate that this taxon does not have a particularly close relationship to Orchidinae. Regarding other genera, Gymnadenia once again is shown here to include Nigritella, although this relationship is weakly supported in both analyses (&gt;50, 61 BP). Delforge (2001) and Teppner &amp; Klein (1998) transferred the species from Nigritella to Gymnadenia without reference to the molecular results. Our findings support their decision. Moreover, the proposal by Bateman &amp; al. (1997) of separating G. borealis from G. conop sea, based on ITS analysis, is corroborated by our coxl/lTS combined analysis (Fig. 3). Within Dactylorhiza most groupings are only weakly sup ported in the combined analysis. However, there is again evi dence that D. viridis (former Coeloglossum viride (L.) Hartm.) is nested within the genus. It has been proposed (Devos &amp; al, 2006) that the results of molecular analyses were compatible with the maintenance of Coeloglossum as an independent en tity; however, our results are not consistent with its segrega tion. Similar results were obtained by our group based on the single copy gene chalcone synthase (Inda &amp; al, unpub.).

Phylogenetics of Orchideae based on coxl intron sequences the mitochondrial and combined matrices is that composed of the Eurosiberian species Platanthera bifolia and Platanthera chlorantha, both of which are sympatric and interfertile (Del forge, 2001). Both the combined coxl/TTS and the mitochondrial DNA trees (Figs. 1 and 3) show that Orchis as traditionally described is clearly polyphyletic. This result has been already highlighted by other authors such as Bateman &amp; al. (1997) and Pridgeon &amp; al. (1997) using ITS. This finding, together with the existence of different chromosome numbers in Orchis motivated the transfer of several Orchis s.l. taxa to Anacamptis s.l. (Bateman &amp; al, 1997). This idea is reinforced by the combined analysis performed here. Another well-supported group in the combined tree (99 BP) is that composed of the members of Orchis s.l. that were transferred to Neotinea by Bateman &amp; al. (1997): Neotinea commutata, Neotinea ustulata and Neotinea lactea. This group were also described by Aceto &amp; al. (1999) in their work based on the ITS, although with lower bootstrap support. The plants belonging to this clade have several morphological similarities; they are small plants and flowers, and the three sepals and two lateral petals are connivent to form a hood. The labellum is tri lobed with the lateral lobes narrow and spreading, and although the central lobe is shallow with an apical notch, it shows little if any development of a tooth or appendage (Pridgeon &amp; al, 2001). Regarding Orchis s.str, there are two distinct groups according to our analyses based on both mitochondrial coxl sequences and the coxl/YYS dataset. The first is the O. branci fortii group (Fig. 1, 3). These taxa had already been clustered based on both ITS analysis (Pridgeon &amp; al, 1997; Aceto &amp; al, 1999) and morphology (Delforge, 2001). The second group is the anthropomorphic clade composed by Orchis (Aceras) anthropophora, Orchis simia, O. militaris and O. purpurea. This group is the one identified as the Orchis militaris group by Delforge (2001) or as the Orchis militaris subgroup by Bateman &amp; al. (1997). In these taxa, most species have inflorescences with large flowers in which petals and sepals are connivent. The lip is anthropomorphic with narrow lateral lobes and a bifid central lobe with an often-elongated tooth in the middle. Two distinct, well-supported groups can also be observed in genus Ophrys in both the combined and the mitochondrial phy logenetic trees. The first group (100 BP in the combined coxl/ ITS consensus tree, Fig. 3) is composed of Ophrys speculum and O. regis-ferdinandii. Both species belong to the O. specu lum group defined by Delforge (2001), and the latter has been considered to be a subspecies of the former in the monograph by Pedersen &amp; Faurholdt (2007). Finally, both species are also in the same group in the phylogenetic study conducted by Devey &amp; al. (2008) based on plastid and nuclear DNA sequences and hypervariable (AFLP) markers. A second group, also strongly supported (97 BP in the combined consensus tree Fig. 3 but not as much in the coxl tree, Fig. 1; 70 BP) is the one composed by O. scolopax, O. spruneri, O. apifera, O. araneola, O. aesculapii and O. cretica. This second group does not correspond with any of the groupings in Delforge (2001); however, all these species are in the same clade in the study conducted by Devey &amp; al. (2008). Finally, in the strict consensus tree based on the coxl/YTS combined dataset (Fig. 3), the species belonging to Ophrys sect. Pseudophrys Godfery (1928) (O. lutea, O.fusca, O. iricolor) form a well-supported group (94 BP). However, this is not the case for the species traditionally included in Ophrys sect. Ophrys. This difference between the classic treatments of Ophrys (Godfery, 1928; Nelson, 1962; Delforge, 2001) and molecular results has been already highlighted by Soliva &amp; al. (2001) in their phylogenetic analysis of Ophrys based on nuclear (ITS) and plastid (trnL-trnF) sequences. Evolution of the coxl group I intron: Lessons from or chids. ? Two main sources of evidence have been used to infer evolution of the coxl group I intron in angiosperms, as well as to determine if horizontal or vertical transfer is the dominant process explaining the patchy distribution of this element in flowering plants. First, incongruence between the phylogenetic trees based on the coxl intron and the organismal trees has been interpreted by different authors (e.g., Barkman &amp; al., 2007; Richardson &amp; Palmer, 2007; Sanchez-Puerta &amp; al., 2008) as evidence for multiple horizontal transfers, whereas congruence between results would be an argument for verti cal transfer (Cusimano &amp; al., 2007). We have observed a high degree of congruence between the analyses of the monocots based on the coxl region (data not shown) and those published by Soltis &amp; al. (2000) and APG (2009) for the angiosperms based on nuclear and plastid regions. Also, a high degree of consistency was observed between the Orchideae (mostly sub tribe Orchidinae) tree based on the coxl intron (Fig. 1) and that based on ITS nrDNA (Bateman &amp; al, 1997, 2003). This congruence might indicate a prevalence of vertical transfer in monocots and, more precisely, in orchids. Unfortunately, most of the monocot coxl sequences available in GenBank (and all the sequences used in this study) belong to only three monocot orders (Alismatales, Zingiberales, Asparagales) so new data on the distribution of the coxl group I intron in angiosperms would be needed to build on the conclusions of this study. It is most parsimonious to interpret the orchid results as being due to vertical transfer because the taxa with the intron are members of a clade, based on other data. We cannot make an effective test for incongruence between the ITS and coxl results here due to the low level of variation in the latter, plus such tests are notoriously unreliable (Reeves &amp; al, 2001). The second main source of evidence is the sequences of the CCTs (co-conversion tracts) found in all the intron-bearing angiosperms (Fig. 2). According to Cusimano &amp; al. (2007), there are 20 different CCTs in angiosperms; however, 60% correspond to the type 6 + T, whereas only 9% belong to the 6+TA. The distribution recovered in these orchids is reversed; only 5% belong to the 6+T type and 94% to 6+TA. The CCT observed in Habenaria delavayi is, to our knowledge, unique to this plant. In their paper of2007, Cusimano &amp; al. highlighted that 11 out of 20 CCT patterns were found in just one species. This is a possibility for H. delavayi, but we had only a single accession of this species available to us. There are several exceptions in this general pattern. Thus O. regis-ferdinandii, O. insectifera, O. speculum and Gennaria diphylla have 6+T CCT (the most common one in angiosperms according to Cusimano &amp; al, 2007); O. iricolor has 5 + T, and 1061</page><page sequence="10">Inda &amp; al. Phylogenetics of Orchideae based on coxl intron sequences TAXON 59 (4) August 2010: 1053-1064 Habenaria delavayi a 2+T pattern. In Ophrys, and as far as we know from the literature, it is the first time that such a variation in CCT has been detected in a single genus, apart from Plan tago L. (Cho &amp; al, 2004). In our opinion, the rapid evolution of Ophrys (Pedersen &amp; Faurholdt, 2007) could be related to this variability. Moreover, the striking differentiation of the CCT in the H delavayi with respect to the other taxa of Habenaria studied could not be explained, and more species from this large and widespread genus should be included in the analysis to get conclusive results. According to Cho &amp; al. (1998) and Cho &amp; Palmer (1999), no matter how closely related two taxa are, any two taxa that have different CCTs probably acquired the intron separately. In our case, that would imply at least three independent different horizontal transfer events in genus Ophrys. We consider that this scenario is better explained under the model proposed by Cusimano &amp; al. (2007) according to which the simplest explanation for the distribution of the intron is that "in each case the intron is inherited vertically, with the exonic tracts decaying stochastically over time". Cusimano &amp; al. (2007) also suggested that intron loss might be a common process in angiosperms, which would explain the existence of CCTs in 22% of the intron-less angiosperms they explored. However, we did not observe this pattern in orchids, in which all intron-less taxa present unaltered tracts. Sanchez-Puerta &amp; al. (2008) proposed that all coxl intron transfers are relatively recent events, and our data support that assertion. Thus, the coxl group I intron is only present in a subtribe of orchids (subtribe Orchidinae sensu Chase &amp; al, 2003) whereas it is absent in the related subtribes such as Disi nae and Brownleeinae and in other subfamilies of orchids such as Epidendroideae (Cho &amp; al, 1998). This result indicates a recent transfer of the intron just prior to the diversification of the group, which took place around 13.7 Ma (Inda &amp; al, unpub.). This recent acquisition of the intron might explain the high prevalence of the 6+TA CCT type in the subtribe (more than 95%). In most lineages of Orchidinae there has not been time enough to make perceptible the stochastic decay of the CCT. Only in rapidly evolving lineages such as Ophrys is this process detectable. Given the absence of the intron in the other orchid lineages studied so far, a horizontal transfer might be the best hypothesis to explain the presence of the intron in this family. We conclude that the parsimony analysis conducted based on the mitochondrial coxl group I intron produced results with relatively low resolution due to the highly conserved nature of mitochondrial DNA in plants. The Bayesian and parsimony analyses based on the combined cor7/nuclear ITS dataset yielded trees that confirmed most of the clades recovered by previous ITS-only analyses, although with higher internal sup port, which facilitates a better understanding of the evolution ary relationships within tribe Orchideae. Our results suggest a recent acquisition of the coxl group I intron in orchids, prior to the diversification of Orchidinae. Also, our data support a vertical transmission of the intron as the prevalent mode within the subtribe. Finally, the variation of the CCTs found in genus Ophrys suggests that variation in co conversion tracts might not be reliable indicators of horizontal transmission in rapidly evolving lineages. To build on this study, new markers should be sequenced, especially plastid and low-copy nuclear regions, in order to have a representation of all plant genomes. The development of new generation sequencing methods, which will soon make complete mitochondrial and plastid plant genomes readily available, will greatly enhance phylogenetic and horizontal transfer studies. Finally, new taxa belonging to tribe Orchideae (and other tribes within the subfamily) should be included in the survey, and the distribution of the coxl intron in the orchid family should be further assessed.
