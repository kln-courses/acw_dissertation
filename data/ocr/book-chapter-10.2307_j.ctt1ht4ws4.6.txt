<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Deviated Histories What is the history of drawing? Can a conclusive account be constructed  or would we find too many outliers and perversions to detect one  definitive trail? With such an amount of material and precedent to build  upon, it is tempting to question what contemporary drawing can achieve  on top of all the seminal projects and concepts developed on the page  across history. Of course, we only need watch a Hollywood film set in the  past to realise how fluid and mutable history can become. The drawing  can become a site for deviating and challenging the historical, whether  through imaginary flights away from the past or the methodological  re-analysis of it. Drawing can serve as an analytical tool to reveal the   real history of spaces, its inherent subjectivity offering a different means  of inquiry to the photograph or text. Salon.com’s work on Mohamed  Bashmilah’s detention at a CIA black site included drawings made  directly from his recollection of the space, a historical record impossible  via other documentary means. To deviate history through drawing might  not be only fantastical, but also political. Fig. 3: Completed painting Zika Virus 2,000,000 X. Two viruses are shown, with the lower one in  cross-section to reveal the RNA genome (yellow) inside. The cell membrane is in green, with long  proteoglycan chains extending upwards. Molecules in the blood plasma include Y-shaped antibodies,  UFO-shaped low density lipoprotein and a long fibrinogen molecule (involved in blood clotting). In this chapter, we will see projects that use history as a site for speculation  and proposition, whether physical or metaphorical. Deviated Histories  leads us through Pablo Bronstein’s eighteenth-century brothels to a  ‘ghostpainting’ of contemporary Beijing, from readings of controversially  demolished buildings to bubblegum pop and the exploratory act of trying  to draw an active volcano. Within these works, we see the breaking and  reframing of history through drawing as a critical act – going back in time  68 Augmentations to redraw the future. </page> <page sequence="2"> Key Note 72  An Introduction to the  120 T he Severed Head Eighteenth Century  Konrad Buhagiar Guillaume Dreyfuss  Pablo Bronstein  Ephraim Joris Papers 77 A  Flat Tale: The Picture Book  122  Pontifical Academy of Sciences as an Architectural Project  Benjamin Ferns  Jana Cˇulek 125 C ampus Martius East 82  With-drawing Room on Vellum:   Parsa Khalili The Persistent Vanishing of  129 the Architectural Drawing Surface   Her Wildflower Gardens at    Penelope Haralambidou One Hundred Five Orchard  Eric Mayer 90  BOX No. 1: Unpacked  132 (Visions of Ron Herron)   Developing Self-Methodologies    Simon Herron for Drawing: Open Air   Performance Museum 96  Drawing a Volcanarium, or   Oğul Öztunç How to Represent a Very Large Figure 135  Adrianne Joergensen Contributor  A rchitect as Urban Ghostpainter  Drawing Architecture Studio 102  Anamorphosis:   An Inquiry into the Unknown  Thi Phuong-Trâm Nguyen Projects 110 F rom Body Agents to Agent Bodies:   Imagining Architectural Embodiment  from the Inside Out  Alessandro Ayuso 114  California Bubblegum Autopark  Jamie Barron 116  A Fall of Ordinariness and Light:  Regeneration!

ARISTOTELIAN INFLUENCES   – THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING The philosophy of the Order of the Minims retained its  roots from its medieval origins. The scholastic tradition   of the Minims and the influence of St Thomas of Aquinas   is present in the preponderance of the knowledge  emerging from the senses in their making. St Thomas   is known for having adapted the writings of Aristotle   to the Christian religion. For Aristotle, the experience   of things, the know-how (techné), the wisdom (sophia)   and science as a demonstrative knowledge (episteme)   are all modes to attain knowledge.12 This Aristotelian  understanding of the world is reflected in Niceron’s  treatise where he states his disapproval of Plato,   “who rejected from mathematics everything that is  related to matter or the material world and his belief   that mathematics loses its purity when it relies   on the perception of the senses to prove a hypothesis”.13  Instead, he gives Archimedes as a model to follow,   “who perfected sciences through use and practice;   we can’t deny that mathematics developed with   that aim has provided us with great useful inventions  Fig. 4: Jean-François Niceron, La Perspective curieuse,   example of a perspective drawing: plate 13, Paris, 1652   Fig. 2: Emmanuel Maignan, view of St Francis de Paola in the  and produced amazing effects with the help  (Bibliothèque nationale de France). convent of Santa Trinità dei Monti, Rome, photo by author. of mechanics”. 14 by man and the external environment.16 Anamorphic  Following Niceron’s understanding of making as a way  images, along with the sundial, are visible manifestations  of comprehending the unknown, Vilém Flusser offers  of our relationship with such invisible phenomena. a contemporary take on the subject in his essay  The Gesture of Making. The piece emphasises how THE SENSES AS SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE,  making can help grasp the world in dialectical terms;  PLEASURE AND DESIRE FOR THE UNEXPECTED or, indeed, how the dialectic can help reconfigure   making. For Flusser, ideas are formed by dialogue For the Minims, understanding the world through   – a negotiation with the real – and “new ideas are making and experimenting forefronted the essential   constantly appearing in the heat of theory’s battle role of the senses as not only a source of knowledge   against a raw, resistant world [...] Through the gesture  but also a source of pleasure.

ARISTOTELIAN INFLUENCES   – THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING The philosophy of the Order of the Minims retained its  roots from its medieval origins. The scholastic tradition   of the Minims and the influence of St Thomas of Aquinas   is present in the preponderance of the knowledge  emerging from the senses in their making. St Thomas   is known for having adapted the writings of Aristotle   to the Christian religion. For Aristotle, the experience   of things, the know-how (techné), the wisdom (sophia)   and science as a demonstrative knowledge (episteme)   are all modes to attain knowledge.12 This Aristotelian  understanding of the world is reflected in Niceron’s  treatise where he states his disapproval of Plato,   “who rejected from mathematics everything that is  related to matter or the material world and his belief   that mathematics loses its purity when it relies   on the perception of the senses to prove a hypothesis”.13  Instead, he gives Archimedes as a model to follow,   “who perfected sciences through use and practice;   we can’t deny that mathematics developed with   that aim has provided us with great useful inventions  Fig. 4: Jean-François Niceron, La Perspective curieuse,   example of a perspective drawing: plate 13, Paris, 1652   Fig. 2: Emmanuel Maignan, view of St Francis de Paola in the  and produced amazing effects with the help  (Bibliothèque nationale de France). convent of Santa Trinità dei Monti, Rome, photo by author. of mechanics”. 14 by man and the external environment.16 Anamorphic  Following Niceron’s understanding of making as a way  images, along with the sundial, are visible manifestations  of comprehending the unknown, Vilém Flusser offers  of our relationship with such invisible phenomena. a contemporary take on the subject in his essay  The Gesture of Making.

Seven gardens of wildflowers are irrigated by collected  rainwater from the storms of spring and early summer.  Sub-surface expansion bladders are pressurised by   six tidal pistons driven by the tidal inlet of the Delaware  River and, in the event of piston failure, one hand pump.  The collected rainwater is pumped through a series   of irrigation corridors, which are infused with varieties   of wildflower seeds, and deposited directly into a dimpled  silt earth surface above. The gardener views her  wildflowers from atop a copper patina filtration platform.  The garden’s boundaries are ever-changing within   the two-acre plot, as they expand and contract at the   will of the tidal pistons compressing water into the   irrigation lines. At the end of the season, she sets out   a roaming chimney, turning the fields into charcoal   to reload the filtration platforms and prepare the earth   for another season.

That image is positioned  against the state of the wildflower garden, which is  situated on a selected parcel fluctuating within the more  recently established boundaries of residential property  lines. This further undercuts expectations brought on   by the site’s expanse when considering its history. The physically developed drawings and model further-  more act as newly developed artefacts which track  variations in the life of the wildflower gardens.

Below grade, the irrigation lines and seed hoppers act as arteries for the automated the history of the farm and the new automated gardens. garden, defining the limits of growth. Seven gardens of wildflowers are irrigated by collected  rainwater from the storms of spring and early summer.  Sub-surface expansion bladders are pressurised by   six tidal pistons driven by the tidal inlet of the Delaware  River and, in the event of piston failure, one hand pump.  The collected rainwater is pumped through a series   of irrigation corridors, which are infused with varieties   of wildflower seeds, and deposited directly into a dimpled  silt earth surface above. The gardener views her  wildflowers from atop a copper patina filtration platform.  The garden’s boundaries are ever-changing within   the two-acre plot, as they expand and contract at the   will of the tidal pistons compressing water into the   irrigation lines. At the end of the season, she sets out   a roaming chimney, turning the fields into charcoal   to reload the filtration platforms and prepare the earth   for another season.

In his book Delirious New York, Rem Koolhaas not try to design them.  Drawing has always been a tool to speculate on the future. It forms   a surface for enacting the desires of society and proposing new ways  in which architecture can facilitate them. From the seminal speculations  of Archigram to Paul Rudolph’s hulking megastructures in pen and   Hugh Ferriss’ crystalline ‘Metropolis of Tomorrow’, the twentieth century  took drawing towards a multitude of possible futures. Most of these  futures will never come to pass, but the potent power of speculative  drawing continues on. If science fiction is always using the future to say  something about the present, then speculative and fantastical drawings  speak of our contemporary concerns. It could be the utopian desire   to build the world again from scratch, or simply the making of a critical  argument about today via the imagery of tomorrow – but either way,  fantasising through drawing remains an evocative and seductive act.  In the following chapter, we will see work that speculates on the future   of drawing as much as the future of worlds. Future Fantasticals takes   us on a journey from Neil Spiller’s singular world manifested in drawing  through to the work of science fiction legend and Blade Runner concept  artist Syd Mead. As we zoom towards the horizon, we will encounter  strange machines for drawing, buildings that combine with biological  creatures and cities that revel in their unrestrained scale. Within each   of these projects, there is a sense of contingency, of a future that might  never come into being except through the act of drawing it. Yet in each  Fig. 3: Dashilar Panorama (detail), 95 × 135 cm, 2015. case, there is the sense that drawing as a speculative tool, with its  human subjectivities and missteps, still has the power to pull us into its  138 Deviated Histories realm and let us dream of things to come. </page> </plain_text>
