Gebel Summary Sepulchral landscapes characterized Arabia's fifth millennium BCE from south-eastern Jordan in the west to Yemen in the east. New evidence from the Qulban Ban! Murra and Rajājil areas shows that these extensive and rather unknown, partly megalithic burial fields were also connected to water management systems. This indicates that they were not only regional centres of commemoration and (tribal?) identity for the mobile pastoral groups benefitting in these mid-Holocene times from moisture episodes on the Arabian Peninsula, but that they also represented meeting places for watering flocks and social transaction. The hydraulic competency and social structures of these well cultures, which used water trough systems, channels, and dams at hydrologically favoured places (high aquifers, seasonal lakes, barraged wadis), may have led to Arabia's earliest oasis socio-economies, a forced adaptation to sedentary life when the climate became colder and drier during the fourth millennium BCE. Depending on their specific ecological conditions, not all regions may have successfully participated in this transition. In parallel, dry areas of the Arabian Peninsula must also have continued to sustain mobile pastoral groups, although witnessing a reduction of their populations. This contribution aims to present the first research hypotheses on such a general potential transition for the Arabian Peninsula, developed on the basis of - and illustrated by - new evidence from south-eastern Jordan and north-western Saudi Arabia. Keywords: Arabian mid-Holocene pastoral well cultures, early oases, socio-hydraulic subsistence shifts, Qulban Ban! Murra, Rajājil Research questions and objectives1 Arabia's virtually unknown fifth-millennium BCE pastoral cultures became recognized through the impressive standing stone sites of Rajājil, south-east of al-Jawf (Zarins 1979), Rizqeh,2 south of Wādī Rum (Kirkbride 1960; 1969; Underbjerg 2002), and lately 1 Two projects are investigating the research questions addressed in this contribution: the Eastern Jafr Joint Archaeological Project/Qulban Banī Murra, carried out under the auspices of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan by ex oriente at Free University of Berlin and Mu'tah University, co-directed by Hans Georg K. Gebel and Hamzeh M. Mahasneh; and the Standing Stones Project/Rajājil, carried out under the auspices of the Saudi Commission of Tourism and Antiquities by ex oriente at Free University of Berlin, Lübeck University of Applied Sciences, Leipzig University, co-directed by Ali al-Ghabban, Hans Georg K. Gebel, Matthias Grottker, and Christoph Zielhofer. Seasons of the Eastern J.A.P. took place in 2001, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2011 (partly co-sponsored by the German Archaeological Institute, Berlin); the Standing Stones J.A.P./Rajalil had its initial season in spring 2012. 2 The extraordinary ritual structure at Chalcolithic Rizqeh with its circular arrangement of more than twenty-five anthropomorphic stelae (today stored at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem) appears unique among the Chalcolithic standing stone sites so far recorded. Qulban Ban! Murra, north of Jabal al-Tubayk (Gebel &amp; Mahasneh 2009; 2012; Gebel 2010; Gebel et al. 2011) (Fig. 1). Similar sites belonging to the Chalcolithic/ Early Bronze Age (EB) could be among those listed by al-Ghazzi (2004, and references therein) for the Tabūk, al-Qassim, and Riyadh regions, by Khalidi (2008) for the Yemeni Tihāmah, and by others, attesting their potential presence also in the east and south-west of the Arabian Peninsula.3 Since their megalithic expression depends on the local availability of suitable banked layers in the bedrock, a large number of non-megalithic burial fields is to be expected on the Arabian Peninsula, not yet having attracted the attention of prehistoric research. 3 There are clear indications that the fifth-millennium BCE pastoral cultures attested by megalithic and non-megalithic burial fields also extended across the present-day arid parts of al-Naqab, Sinai (Avner 2002) and the Maghreb, as far west as the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (Roczen 2008), possibly allowing us to speak of a 'mid- Holocene Green Saharo-Arabian Pastoral Belt' (Gebel &amp; Mahasneh 2012). Many of the sites visited by the author so far, especially the megalithic ones, have been subject to repeated looting since Chalcolithic times.</page><page sequence="2">112 Hans Georg K. Gebel Figure 1. The location of Qulban Bani Murra , Rajājil, and Rasif in south-east Jordan/north-west Arabia ( cartography : P. Voss). Meanwhile, the regional study project at Qulban Ban! Murra has provided information to suggest that the standing stone sites must have been part of complex and widely aceramic pastoral networks in Arabia which co- existed and culturally exchanged with the Chalcolithic cultures in the more moderate areas of the central and southern Levant. As evidence from the Greater Qulban Ban! Murra and Rajājil areas suggests, these burial sites were focal points in sepulchral landscapes and were also characterized by wells4/watering places, dam systems and possibly habitation sites and structures (see below the discussion of the inselberg pen camps). Obviously these occupations represent moister and warmer episodes in the fifth millennium BCE during which higher rainfall/ aquifers triggered progressive population dynamics in the mobile pastoral societies. Our two projects follow novel 4 Records of mid-Holocene pre-oasis wells from the present-day arid and hyper-arid Arabian lands are extremely rare. Apart from the Qulban Ban! Murra, for Rajājil a possible Chalcolithic well with small stone- lined troughs is mentioned by Zarins (1979). Avner (2002: 25, figs 2, 84-85) mentions wells from the al-Naqab ('Uvda Valley and Ma'laleh Shaharut) which may also date from the fifth millennium BCE. research hypotheses5 promoted by the author, explicitly understanding that the oasis socio-economies must have developed gradually and in regionally different ways from the previous pastoral well cultures during the fourth millennium BCE, after the climate had become drier and colder (the so-called Rapid Climate Change from 6000 to 5200/5000 BP, or the 5.2. ka BP event, see Weninger et al. 2009; Bar-Matthews &amp; Ayalon 20 II6). The hitherto mobile shepherds of the standing stone sites started to settle at hydrologically advantageous locations, applying their water management competencies to establish a sedentary oasis life while maintaining their social (tribal) organization. This transition is also understood as the concluding and finally sustainable act of sedentarization in arid Arabia, after Neolithic sedentarization had not succeeded in many parts of Arabia. 5 These hypotheses were taken up by Jana Pokrandt, Berlin, to be further tested in the context of her PhD project on the socio-economy and palaeoecology of oasis origins in the Late Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age on the Arabian Peninsula. 6 For the discussion of an enhanced aridity during the fourth millennium BCE in north Africa, south-west and south Asia, see Brooks 2006 and literature quoted there.</page><page sequence="3">Arabia 's fifth-millennium BCE pastoral well cultures: hypotheses on the origins of oasis life 113 The general questions and objectives of our research on the fifth-millennium pastoral well cultures and the succeeding fourth-millennium BCE cultural adaptations are concerned with: - modelling the mid-Holocene palaeoclimatological and palaeoenvironmental oscillations and palaeohydrological regimes, and how these relate to - shifting adaptive strategies in environmental technologies (especially the archaeohydrological evidence) and in socio-economies attested with the pastoral occupations and early oasis horticultural societies after 4000 BCE.7 The nexuses between climate shifts, environments, water management, subsistence modes, and societies are central for our research. It is our understanding that these can be approached only by a transdisciplinary effort commenced and maintained by archaeology, geoarchaeology, palaeoclimatology, palaeohydrology, archaeohydrology, palynology, archaeozoology, palaeoethnobotany, botany, ethnography, human ethology, and cognitive sciences. Research methods, questions, and goals are guided by a regime of hypotheses (outlined in detail at the end of this paper), which serves as the corporate working basis for the participating disciplines. They guarantee the confirmative framework, transparency, and traceability of the amended and always refined hypotheses, objectives, and methods during the development of the projects. The archaeological research questions relate to the expected tribal organization and territoriality which formed the social identities and ritual life of the mobile pastoralists using the grasslands, lakes, and seasonal water places by established migratory networks both on regional and supra-regional levels. In favourable hydrological locations like Rajājil as early as the fifth millennium BCE, some kinds of sedentism may have existed, and the site's favourable location close to the Wādī Sirhān Basin made it a potential 'bridgehead' for the spread of oasis economies when precipitation decreased after 4000 BCE. The societal structures and funeral ethos may have largely persisted into the fourth millennium when pastoral water management is believed to have become the hydraulic substratum of oasis life. Even minor and short-term climatic shifts must have had severe hydrological and other environmental consequences in our sensitive study areas, causing a larger variability in adaptations affecting the migratory webs, population 7 In part, similar research objectives are followed by the RASA Project in Yemen (Harrower 2010; Harrower, Oches &amp; McCorriston 201 1). dynamics, subsistence, and water management strategies, etc. (Gebel &amp; Mahasneh 2012; Gebel et al. 2011; Wellbrock, Voss &amp; Grottker 201 1 ; 2012). The chronological and palaeoenvironmental discourse It needs to be emphasized that both chronological as well as palaeoclimatological data are rare for our subject, and existing ones are often contradictory. In particular, we expect to deal with regionally and locally incoherent records on the palaeoclimate, reflecting incoherent regional or local conditions. Our new subject will need a substantial and finely resolved body of absolute data without which the project hypotheses cannot be tested. This requires patience, since our deflated environments do not provide much preserved sedimentary environments/ datable material in comparison to Levantine areas. The tracing of minor climate oscillations and their regional/ local expressions will be particularly important, since they directly influenced changes visible in the archaeological, environmental, and hydrological record. Until 2010, our fossile directeur , the 'fan scraper', was the only datable evidence (generally dated to the Late Chalcolithic/ EB). The first radiocarbon data obtained come from the supposed insulation material (coating of the troughs) of Space 12 of the well/watering complex D15 in Qulban Ban! Murra, attributing the structure to the second half of the fifth millennium BC.8 Additionally, almost no palaeoclimatological and palaeohydrological information is available for our immediate research areas: Whitney, Faulkender and Rubin (1983) record mid-Holocene lake periods for the an-Nafud in the second half of the fifth millennium BCE, while Schulz and Whitney (1986) reconstruct alternating inter-dune lacustrine environments between 6400-3400 BCE, followed by progressive aridification. Further information on a humid fifth millennium, followed by vanishing wet phases as a consequence of climatic deterioration during the fourth millennium BCE, is available for the Arabian Peninsula from speleothems (Fleitmann et al. 2003; 2004), lacustrine and other 8 The date of KIA43373 is 4459-4346 cal BC (2 sigma range); the humic acid fractions of the same sample and of KIA43374 have to be considered too old (521 7-501 8 and 5056-4894 cal BC, 2 sigma ranges), but they suggest that KIA43374 could also be from the second half of the fifth millennium BC (Dr A. Dreves, Leibniz Labor für Altersbestimmung und Isotopenforschung, Kiel University, correspondence; Jana Pokrandt, Kiel University, personal communication).

These findings are in general accordance with observations on mid-Holocene wet intervals from the southern Levant (e.g. Bar-Mathews &amp; Ayalon 201 1).9 The so-called 5.2 ka BP drought event represents the end of the mid-Holocene wet phases (Staubwasser &amp; Weiss 2006; Weninger et al. 2009). For the time being, palaeohydrological modelling - successfully conducted for the Tayma Oasis by Wellbrock, Voss and Grottker (2011) and Engel et al. (2012) - are matching these general palaeoclimatological findings. The burial fields and watering complexes of Qulbãn Bani Murra and its environs The cairn fields The megalithic burial grounds of Qulbãn Ban! Murra (Kirkbride &amp; Harding 1944) cluster on the shallow and slightly dissected banks of remote Wad! Sahab al-Abyad, north of Jabal al-Tubayq (at 30°03'50"-30°05'04" N and 37°14'35"-37°15'35" E, wadi floor: 867-865 m NN; 13 km north of the Jordan-Saudi Arabia border; Figs 1-3); they cover more than 1 km2 of the hammada hills. The general characteristics of the site areas differ considerably from each other, both in terms of structure types, organization of space, image inventories, surface finds, etc. This may either represent a functional or a temporal diversity, or both (Gebel &amp; Mahasneh 2012). The late Chalcolithic/EB structural variability comprises megalithic, 'pseudo-megalithic', and non-megalithic grave structures; 'horseshoe structures'; watering/well complexes; domestic camp structures; ashlar mining and supply areas; water harvesting instalments such as dams and modified natural basins/gullies; and a number of megalithic features which seem to have had a special function. The cairn types are not yet completely understood, but include various types of multi-chambered cairns with ashlar lines and trilith groups; single/double- chambered cairns/graves with trilith groups (Fig. 3), occasionally with 'horseshoe structures'; and circular structures of standing stones. The single-/double-/multi- chambered ashlar-line cairns are marked by ashlars on their north-east-south-east sides, often associated with 9 Migowski et al. (2006: 426-427), however, identified climate amelioration after 4000 BCE in the Dead Sea sedimentary records. This is supported by pollen data from the Dead Sea shore, indicating a wetter and colder period between 4300 and 1300 BCE (Litt et al. 2012). s: o S s g &gt;&gt; 0 1 §} s •5 "^3 S Q § ^ g s; ^ ■Sí H ¿ s- ? s- go ^ O « § I « v f "S •5 o ?

Bshesh). triliths of smaller ashlars to the south-east. Altogether, 218 prominent structures were found in Areas A-F, not including outlying Areas G-H. The site is aceramic throughout, and its lithic surface inventories are dominated by fan scrapers. Area A is characterized by a 1 30 m-long line of circular megalithic structures (Structures A 15-31, Gebel 2010: fig. 1), a large space structured by an arrangement of huge ashlars (possibly a ceremonial place or sanctuary), and many other megalithic circular spaces and cairn graves. The latest use of Structures A 15-31 is represented by chipping floors produced by the reshaping of fan scrapers and animal bones on the interior stone pavements. The iconographie inventory of these structures represents ibexes and a four-legged animal.10 Area B is occupied by isolated, sometimes very large megalithic ashlar-line chamber cairns (Fig. 3) with triliths in the south-east, showing many signs of additive/subsequent burials and added/extended peripheral pavements/pavement terraces. Area C has a chain of isolated megalithic two-chamber cairns/graves with ashlars (Fig. 3), often with annexe 10 We understand the rock depictions of Qulbãn Ban! Murra as a reflection of a common but restricted animal symbolism confined to the ibex and the cheetah, representing a more unspecific commonsensical (as well as decorative?) iconography of veneration, which is not specifically related to ritual contexts (Gebel &amp; Mahasneh 2009).

Area E is again characterized by isolated large megalithic ashlar-line chamber cairns with or without triliths, and ashlar fields/quarries in its lower parts; the grave structures of Area E show a high degree of structural variability. The watering complexes The investigation of the favourable hydrological setting of Qulbãn Ban! Murra (by Patrick Keilholz and Bilal Khrisat) has revealed that, a) the major aquifer of Wad! Sahab al-Abyad was joined by two local aquifers immediately upstream of the well structures; and b) it was additionally supported by a sub-surface narrowing of the bedrock (the 'QBM neck'), pressing up the water from the aquifers in the area of the wells. The well/watering complexes are embedded in small mounds formed by the enigmatic reddish and silty insulation material of the troughs and the dumps of well shafts. The ground plans of the multi- spaced watering complexes (e.g. Fig. 6) are outlined by single-row and single-course walls made of upright slabs and small ashlars. They form clusters of curvilinear, polygonal, oblong, and sub-oval spaces sharing their walls. Each complex has between twelve and twenty- four such spaces, which are often further subdivided by ashlars/slabs, as well as a central or marginal depression (the well). These compartmented and paved channel- like structures are 1.5-10 m long, ending in roundish or curvilinear spaces (e.g. Fig. 6); their gradient bottoms reach their highest points close to the well's mouth. Each complex shows one to three interior stone piles and ashlars still standing. The depressions indicate the well room, with a staircase leading down to the well's mouth (Fig. 5, left).</page><page sequence="7">Arabia s fifth-millennium BCE pastoral well cultures: hypotheses on the origins of oasis life 117 Figure 6. Qu I ban Banī Murra, Structure Dl 5: the well/watering complex dated to the second half of the fifth millennium BCE (field records: J . Pokrandt/P Keilholz; graph: C. Purschwitz). The excavation of the well shaft (diam. 1 .2 m) of Complex D1 5 was stopped due to safety considerations at a depth of 4.4 m; its upper part is made of corbelled masonry (Fig. 5, right), which rests on rather solid wadi deposits into which small cavities were set to serve as steps (Fig. 5, right). Radiocarbon dates (see above) confirm the well's use in the Chalcolithic period, during the second half of the fifth millennium BC; fan scrapers were found in the areas of the well structures, but we may suppose that the well shafts of Qulban Ban! Murra were re-excavated in later times. The partial excavation of Complex D15, however, showed unpatinated Late Chalcolithic/EB flint artefacts. The cairn fields of Wãdl Sahab al-Abyad and Wādī Sahab al-Asmar While the Qulban Ban! Murra Late Chalcolithic/EB cairn fields are by far the most impressive ones in the region due to their megalithism, many other locations in neighbouring drainage systems bear cairn fields, even large ones like Wādī Sahab al-Asmar 9 and 10. There seem to be no standards for field sizes (extension, number of cairns), cairn arrangements, internal density, or for their structural dimensions. There is a clear tendency, however, for cairns to be aligned on ridges. Isolated cairns, or groups of two to three cairns dispersed in the landscape, are also common but may not all belong to the Late Chalcolithic/EB, or were reused in later periods. As in in Qulban Banī Murra, the Late Chalcolithic/ EB stone-covered grave chambers or pits of Wad! Sahab al-Abyad and Wâdî Sahab al-Asmar are located to the west, delineated by an eastern line of stones/ashlars; the stone covers of the cairns were extended when new chambers/pits were added. The ground plan of a larger ashlar-line chamber cairn tends to be D-shaped, a type also attested in Rajājil. Again, the cairns have groups of three (smaller) ashlars (triliths) in their south-east. A particular variation of the ashlar-line chamber cairn is represented by 'chequerboard pattern' ground plans of two to three chamber rows extending westwards one behind the other, e.g. cairns WadT Sahab al-Asmar 8:11 and 9:41-42 (a type also attested in Rajājil, see Fig. 9). With such structures, standing ashlars/ashlar rows may appear inside the ground plan of a cairn.</page><page sequence="8">118 Hans Georg K. Gebel Figure 7.

G.K. Gebel). In the stone cover of the multi-chambered Late Chalcolithic/EB ashlar-line Cairn 11 of the cairn field of Wad! Sahab al-Asmar 8, a columnar basalt statue fragment (Fig. 4) was found, together with the head of a statue made of calcareous sandstone (Gebel 2010: fig. 5). The basalt fragment represents the head and abdomen of a statue (preserved length is 35 cm), probably showing a male with thick lips or a beard, a long nose, ear depressions, and expressive eye depressions. The most intriguing features are two grooves around the front and sides of the head and the neckline-like feature of a shirt or robe on the chest. Rescue operations at the looted cairns of Wad! Sahab al-Asmar 8:11 and 9:41-42 and Qulban Ban! Murra secured remaining anthropological material and associated artefacts. As mentioned above, it became evident from layers not touched by recent looters that these graves had been disturbed by looting in ancient times, including reburying during the Late Chalcolithic/ EB: in cairns WadT Sahab al-Asmar 9:41-42 intense fracturing of human remains is attested on which a fire had been burning (ritual 'cleansing' of a burial?), followed by another dense layer of fractured human bones. Most likely, the cairns both of Wādī Sahab al-Abya&lt;J and WadT Sahab al-Asmar belong to the second half of the fifth millennium BC or to the (earlier?) fourth millennium BC. The inselberg pen camps of Wādī Sahab al- Aby ad and WadT Sahab al-Asmar The inselberg foot zones of WadT Sahab al-Abya&lt;J and WadT Sahab al-Asmar (sites WadT Sahab al-Abyad 14 and WadT Sahab al-Asmar 6 [Fig. 7], 16, 20, 21 and 23) are the specific locations of aceramic pen camp sites (Gebel et al. 201 1), characterized by larger (20-30 m) and smaller (3-6 m) circular and sub-circular enclosures and structures, sometimes in terraced succession, interpreted as pens, habitation structures, and silos; terrace walls; various types of ground plans of unknown function (possibly some had ritual functions); hearths; platforms; cairns with/without ashlars/ashlar lines and other grave types; isolated (groups of) ashlars; rare ibex and other rock art, etc. Dam-like terrace walls may occur along a camp's former wadi flank (e.g. WadT Sahab al-Asmar 21); at another site (WadT Sahab al-Asmar 16) a wadi-side field of large boulders appears to have additionally served as a 'breakwater' structure. Where bedrock sources allow, structures may be megalithic. The structural diversity and horizontal stratigraphy of the sites is a challenge for our understanding. The size of the camps is 200-300 m in length and 50-100 m in width around the inselberg outcrop (e.g. Fig. 7). The inselbergs must have functioned as windbreaks and as barriers/diversions for the aquifers and surface waters, making them ideal places to collect water by wells and mshãsh pools ( mshãsh : seasonally used system of artificial water holes). The camps' flake industries used chert and quartzite; fan and other scrapers are rare, as are grinding tools. Wells and watering complexes, if not also gardens, are believed to have been buried by the wadis' post-occupational gravels, as is true for some of the camp structures. Future geo-electric resistivity or geo-radar surveys may help to locate these. Some of the deflated camps seem to indicate a horizontal stratigraphy (e.g. WadT Sahab al-Abya&lt;J 14), representing at least two occupations with domestic/pen and funeral functions. Although we call these sites 'camps', their functional diversity, extensions, and seasonality may justify the term settlement. Several structures were excavated at WadT Sahab al-Asmar 6 in 201 1, confirming the above-mentioned functionally diversified occupation. A smaller (domestic) structure showed shelter walls and bin-like supply structures at its interior perimeter,</page><page sequence="12">122 Hans Georg K. Gebel fireplaces, a floor pavement with a central ashlar, and two stratigraphically distinct occupations. It is likely that the inselberg pen camps are part of a Late Chalcolithic/EB seasonal or (semi-)permanent occupation in the region, representing either settlements of the second half of the fifth millennium BCE (see Hypothesis 3) and/or ultimately unsuccessful onsets of sedentary life during the early fourth millennium (see Hypothesis 4 and Fig. 11). As of yet, however, no radiocarbon dates are available for the pen camp sites, and our relative chronological evidence (rare fan scrapers, D-shaped ashlar-line graves and other late fifth-/ early fourth-millennium BCE features) does not exclude that they also are of Late Neolithic origin (the result of an earlier moist period), being re-occupied in the Late Chalcolithic/EB. Rajājil and the greater Rajājil area The first presentation of results of the initial survey in the greater Rajājil area (Spring 2012) is the subject of publication in Atlal (see Gebel, Grottker &amp; Zielhofer in preparation). It can be reported here, however, that the surveys revealed a high variability in hydraulic human adaptation during recent, sub-recent, historic, and prehistoric (especially mid-Holocene) times, seemingly directly reflecting the impacts of climate and societal change. Charcoal-bearing qa layers (qa: depression seasonally filled with rainwater and fine sediments, salinity less than in a sebkhd) were found, which were related presumably to mid-Holocene water management systems (dams, troughs, wells) at the qa of Rasif (a supposed mid-Holocene periodical lakeside location), associated with the D-shaped Chalcolithic ashlar-line cairns (Fig. 10). The other mid-Holocene burial fields and water management systems, including Rajājil (Figs 8-9), are exclusively or predominantly aceramic, yielding foliates (late sixth to early fifth millennium BCE) and fan scrapers (late fifth and early fourth millennium BCE). The structural variability in the deflated sites of the Greater Rajājil Region indicates horizontal stratigraphies and a functional differentiation beyond 'common standards' known from pastoral Chalcolithic camps. Rajājil is unique for its impressive ashlar sizes of up to 4 m (due to local bedrock qualities), but does not seem to be too extraordinary if compared to other, similar sites of the region. A sounding carried out on the southern ridge of Rajājil (Fig. 8) provided rich fifth-millennium BCE artefacts and human/animal bones in a huge (looted) cairn area. In addition to a general surface survey, soundings, photometric, and GIS works for individual structures, a top plan including a DTM and geoelectrical tomographic mapping took place at Rajājil in 2012. Unfortunately, Rajājil has been severely affected by agricultural development in the past two decades and has survived only in its fenced areas; the Chalcolithic settlements and the well mentioned by Zarins (1979) could no longer be found. Other standing stone sites on the Arabian Peninsula In 2004, A.S. al-Ghazzi published a first compilation of standing stone sites on Saudi territory. Believing them to date from the Neolithic period, he interpreted them as probably pastoral locations for religious/ceremonial and social meetings. Khalidi (2008) testifies a concentration of standing stone sites in the Yemeni Tihāmah, claiming a late third-/early second-millennium BCE date for them. Several more from the arid areas of Arabian countries, which have not yet been subject to investigation, are reported by local people and colleagues. The character and structures of some do not allow an assignment to the Chalcolithic/EB period; most probably also other, yet ill understood later periods were characterized by the construction or reuse of standing stone sites: the research on Arabia's standing stone cultures is in its beginnings, and their chronological diagnostics still have to be evaluated.11 Hypotheses on the transition from well- based pastoralism to well-based oasis life in Arabia between 4500-3500/3000 BC The project's hypotheses approach the questions of a climatologically induced transformation from hitherto ill known mobile shepherd cultures of the second half of the fifth millennium BC to regional onsets or establishments of sedentary oasis life after 4000 BC. Contrary to the older understanding that oasis life must be the result of a mid-Holocene climate optimum, the hypotheses claim that the extensive, mobile, well-based steppe pastoralism of the mid-Holocene was favoured by the contemporary climate, and gradually altered into sedentary well-based 11 The western standing stone sites of the Chalcolithic/EB should be identifiable by their grave types, especially the D-shaped ashlar-line graves oriented towards the east, and by the presence of fan scrapers, a certain type of spindle-whorl/mace head and shell bangle, and Chalcolithic/EB pottery.</page><page sequence="13">Arabia s fifth-millennium BCE pastoral well cultures: hypotheses on the origins of oasis life 123 oasis horticulture when colder and drier conditions developed in the Arabian Peninsula during the fourth millennium BCE. Declining natural conditions after 4000 BC presumably altered major parts of the long-range pastoral networks or made them collapse, while some areas became incubator regions for the historically new oasis life mode, whether or not it ended with a successful establishment of oasis life or a regressive pastoral adaptation. In areas still having high water tables, the fortified well must have become the central element of the first oasis living quarters.12 Complex and regionally diversified patterns of 'pastoralization' and 'oasization', however, have to be supposed for Arabia's different regions, including a polycentric and 'time-shifted' introduction of oasis economies. It should be stressed that the following hypotheses simplify and exaggerate developments in order to give a pronounced picture of the elements and steps expected to dominate the trajectory, which otherwise are based on a hitherto poor knowledge of Arabia in the fifth and fourth millennia BCE. Aspects which already have an initial empiric basis are marked by an asterisk (*). These data are or have been presented in publications or submitted papers by the author and colleagues (e.g. Gebel et al. 1989; 2011; Gebel, Grottker &amp; Zielhofer, in preparation; Gebel &amp; Mahasneh 2009; 2012; Gebel 2010). Hypothesis 1: parallel to sedentary Chalcolithic cultures in moderate regions, complex and mobile pastoral societies* established and populated extensive sepulchral landscapes* with watering places* and long-range migration systems in Arabia's present-day arid lands. Their subsistence and progressive population dynamics were favoured by the so-called mid-Holocene climate optima* on the Arabian Peninsula, during which extensive steppe grasslands with lakes and aquifers with high water tables came to exist; water places in still unfavourable areas allowed the crossing of dry lands. These conditions not only sustained a progressive productivity of flocks, they also provided large populations of wild ungulates for hunting and the nutritional value of wild date stands, easy to store and transport over long distances. These 'green desert events' represent the second major settlement period in many parts of Holocene Arabia, after a first influx and temporary establishment of pastoral and sedentary life related to Middle/Late PPNB and Late Neolithic periods before the 6200 BCE 'Rapid Climate Change' event. 12 e.g. Early Bronze Age Hili 8, al-Ain/Buraimi Oasis, Abu Dhabi Emirate (Cleuziou 1989; Cleuziou &amp; Constantini 1989) or the early oases in interior Oman (Frifelt 1985). Hypothesis 2: in the fifth millennium BCE, tribal modes of organization were established as a sustainable and prevailing social identity ('palaeobedouins'), with their specific territoriality and environmental techniques of adaptation to (semi-)arid regions as known today. The long-distance networks of these pastoral cultures during the mid-Holocene climate optima existed from the Sinai* in the west to areas east of Riyadh* and possibly Yemen (probably representing a 'mid-Holocene Saharo-Arabian green desert belt') and may have created similar cultural and ideological milieus. Early Egypto-Mesopotamian connections may have used such pastoral networks via the al-Jawf/al-Naqab/Sinai regions as a mechanism for long-distance exchange. Hypothesis 3: during these wet phases, locally restricted (horizontal) transhumant patterns were already established in favourable locations (especially at the major corridors with access to the routes of ungulate migration/ibex habitats and favourable hydrological settings), which showed tendencies for at least seasonal or even permanent philopatry/sedentism*. Eventually such conditions existed in Wâdî Sahab al-Abya&lt;1 and Wad! Sahab al- Asmar (and certainly in the greater Rajājil area) where13 the inselberg pen camp sites with their astonishing structural complexity were founded (or re-occupied, if they are of Late Neolithic origin, see above) . We have to expect the possibility that islands of permanent occupation* continued to exist from the PPNB on the Arabian Peninsula, remaining in post-Neolithic socio-economies. Hypothesis 4: conditions got steadily drier and colder between 4000 and 3000 BCE ('Rapid Climate Change' 6000-5200/5000 BP; Weninger et al. 2009)*. Steppe habitats with their lakes* and high aquifers retreated in most regions, and major parts of the hitherto mobile herds-people concentrated at the remaining water-rich locations; regressive pastoral population dynamics were associated with this development. At such spots, the mobile pastoralists either tried unsuccessfully to settle down (see the aforementioned inselberg pen camps, cf. Fig. 11)* or became sedentary oasis horticulturalists while maintaining their tribal organization and identity. They used their experience with well building and channel-type watering systems/troughs* for the new oasis irrigation systems while domesticating the wild date palm which already grew in many of the remaining water-rich locations: here oasis horticulture developed in the shadow and micro-climate created by the palm 13 In the Greater Rajajil Region, however, sites with pens are rare.</page><page sequence="14">124 Hans Georg K. Gebel fronds. A new, innovative, and sustainable economy developed from a climatic change*, which a major part of the pastoral steppe populations must have experienced as a destruction of their life modes. Pastoralism, however, must have supplemented early oasis subsistence, and vice versa Hypothesis 5: regions like Qulban Ban! Murra could probably share this development (Hypothesis 4) for only a few centuries after 4000 BCE; (re-occupied?) pen camps like Wad! Sahab al-Abya&lt;J 1 4 and Wâdî Sahab al-Asmar 6, 15, 20 and 21 could represent a regional 'warm-up' - see Hypothesis 3 - for the oasis economy. Depending on the locally remaining natural water supply during aridization in the first half of the fourth millennium BCE, such localities could either, 1) have been temporary incubator regions for the new oasis economy; 2) become places of a disappearing seasonal life mode existing in parallel with developing early oases at more water-favoured spots*; or 3) were settings which had permitted seasonal pastoral life only during the earlier climatic optimum. The greater Rajājil area may have witnessed the full transition to - and in places the rather early establishment of - an oasis economy*. Burial fields would have continuously been used/established in all scenarios*, of course varying in intensity and structural expression. Hypothesis 6: by the end of the fourth millennium BC, the Middle East's sedentarization trajectory was finally completed for most of Arabia's present-day arid zones, by an ecologically forced adaptation from well/ lake-based pastoral life to well/channel-based oasis life*. Future research will substantiate, refine, and/or modify further the trajectories outlined in the hypotheses, which are based on our fieldwork results and the first radiocarbon dates. This research opens a new chapter of Arabia's history and the origins of its greatest innovative environmental adaptation, the oasis paradigm.
