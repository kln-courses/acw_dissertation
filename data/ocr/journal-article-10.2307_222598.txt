Czinkota New York: Praeger Publishers, 1982 $19.95 Exporting has attracted almost universal attention from policy makers, who view it as an enterprise activity critical for achieving national economic goals. This concern has spawned a research tradition whose primary focus has been under- standing export behavior at an aggregated level and identifying a specific role that governments can play in stimulating exporting activity. Needless to say, the yield from such efforts has been meager and has led to alternative analytical frameworks which examine exporting at the level of individual firms. Using a microtheoretical approach for analysis has the distinct merit of recogniz- ing variability in firms' export behavior which can be traced to functionally spe- cific managerial and firm factors. Three recent books by Praeger Publishers are in this mode and examine many different aspects of exporting activity. Two of the publications represent proceedings from the First International Symposium on exporting held at Georgetown University in Summer of 1981; the remaining text is the publication of a doctoral thesis based on questionnaire data from American manufacturing exporting firms. This review will devote most of its attention to the conference publications since these present material which is extremely relevant to current debates on export policy and management. The publications focus on issues in export management and on export policy respectively. Both books include contributions from a num- ber of authors based on different export studies conducted in such countries as the U.S., Canada, Belgium, England, Norway, Australia, and so on. In spite of the different perspectives that are presented, the basic consistencies in findings and recommendations suggest that a common analytical framework for examining behavior does exist. The papers vary significantly in quality and in importance, some challenging some more commonly held views of exporting, while others offer some rather mundane elaborations on what is generally known on the subject. The types of enterprises surveyed include small, owner-managed enterprises, medium-sized companies, and large multinationals. In the Export Management collection, 3 Canadian studies by Gerard Garnier, Mary EXPORT Brooks and Phil Rosson, and the reviewer question some basic assumptions MANAGEMENT: about specific qualities that small exporting firms are alleged to have. These AN authors suggest that fundamental differences between exporters and nonex- INTERNATIONAL porters are artifactual and cannot be justified without closer examination of spe- CONTEXT Journal of International Business Studies, Fall 1983 153</page><page sequence="2">cific resource endowments that are export relevant. The capacity to conduct exporting, these writers seem to argue, is complicated by the way resources are distributed within the firm and by their quality, rather than by any absolute magni- tude. This argument is, of course, in direct contradiction with those who have argued that exporting requires a critical mass in order to be undertaken. Although the small firm indisputably engages in exporting as we familiarly know it, this may not be so for the multinational. A Belgian study by Daniel Van Bulcke provides evidence that much of the trade between multinational enterprises may arise as a result of intragroup sales. Van Bulcke also argues persuasively that these firms are likely to respond differently to export promotion measures when compared with enterprises that have no foreign subsidiaries. These conclusions are important in view of the widely held but unproven belief that all firms can be encouraged to behave in a manner consistent with government export policy ir- respective of their peculiar organizational development, goals, structure, or strategy. In this context, Ravi Sarathy's conclusion provides a valuable insight: that the export success of the Japanese firms can be partially traced to subcon- tracting relationships which give them a greater financial flexibility and capacity for substituting between labor and capital. Both writers implicitly argue for a more complex view of the export process. The theme that firms are constantly adapting to opportunities on a strategic basis is further elaborated by Peter Buckley. His analysis shows that exporting is a complementary method of a foreign expansion, and he provides a framework for examining the process of foreign expansion as an issue of strategic choice. This perspective is also adopted by Bilkey and Songchaikul who examine com- monalities between exports, imports, and foreign direct investment in the second volume. What particularly detracts from the full potential of Buckley's otherwise perceptive analysis is his regard for exports as a sequential process that is internal to the firm and that does not appear to be affected by the administrative arrange- ments the firm uses to conduct the activity. This oversight is partially compen- sated by David Ford and Phillip Rossons' article on the relationships between manufacturers and their overseas distributors. Surprisingly, that study is the only one which pays some attention to channel issues-an area which, given its impor- tance, has suffered unwarranted neglect in the export literature. EXPORT POLICY: The second book, Export Policy: A Global Assessment, offers a wide-ranging ex- A GLOBAL amination of different national policies for export promotion. Several contributors ASSESSMENT illustrate the close relationship between foreign policy, trading arrangements, and some of the imperatives which guide export policy. They show how difficult isolat- ing the effects of each factor can be, and they present clearly the political dimen- sions of trade policy. Recent American govenment use of special legislation to control trade in high technology goods is a case in point. Apart from the general recognition in this volume that governments seem to be more effective in inhibiting exports than stimulating them, some specific attention is paid to problems of as- sisting export development. A paper by James Walsh and Joseph Talarico, for ex- ample, illustrates how rules and regulations add to regulatory burdens, paperwork requirements and thus restrain export activity. These writers offer little optimism that the exporters task will become any easier. Indeed another contributor, Tom Becker, makes a persuasive and well-documented case for failure in the U.S. to use the export trading company as an instrument for unlocking the potential in small and medium sized firms. There is only one empirical study which addresses the issue of export promotion effectiveness in government policy. This study by Michael Czinkota, one of the co- authors of the proceedings, has, however, some major difficulties in identifying the extent to which export policies have actually affected firm export performance. 154 Journal of International Business Studies, Fall 1983</page><page sequence="3">The difficulties arise because the study relies primarily on qualitative and percep- tual measures. As a result, policy makers are offered little practical guidance on which of the programs are stimulating exports beyond that ordinarily intended by the firm. This is unfortunate because the issue of program effectiveness continues to be the untouched part of the research agenda facing export analysts. The third book, Export Development Strategies, is an outgrowth of Czinkota's doc- EXPORT toral thesis, some aspects of which have appeared in the export literature and the DEVELOPMENT books reviewed above. Like all theses in rapidly growing fields, this work is vul- STRATEGIES: nerable to obsolescence, particularly so because the underlying conceptual U.S. PROMOTION framework is far from rigorous. The author argues that firms' export behavior can POLICY be classified according to evolutionary stages of development. These stages are hypothesized to correspond to particular export response modes and are associ- ated with unique firm profiles. These profiles can then be used to selectively target export promotion programs. Apart from the obvious potential for tautology, the greater danger appears to be an obviously mechanistic view of the firm. The ortho- doxy of so-called firm sequential growth is borrowed from those who tend to view firms' export activity in an anthropomorphic way. There is considerable evidence to suggest that firm export activity is not as rigidly constrained nor as simple as the author makes it out to be. Nevertheless the author should be applauded for in- vestigating an area in which much is assumed but little is known. In summary, the 3 books provide an extensive bibliography on export behavior at the enterprise and national levels. Furthermore, all the material is within context. These strengths, together with the fact that a rare access is offered to an important international literature on the subject, are sufficient to make the books mandatory reading for those concerned with export behavior. These publications debate issues which are germane to a major public policy problem and private sector con- cern, and they certainly provide a wide-ranging exploration of current export re- search. Investigators looking for an export research agenda are certain to find it within these books. The export constituency certainly owes a singular debt to Czinkota, his co-editor, and the National Export-Import Council for assembling a timely contribution to export knowledge. Stanley D.
