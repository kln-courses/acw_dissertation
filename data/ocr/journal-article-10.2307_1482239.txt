<plain_text><page sequence="1">Herbert R. Broderick Observations on the Creation Cycle of the Sarajevo Haggadah* In a perceptive and wide-ranging article entitled &gt;Late-Antique Influences in some English Me- diaeval Illustrations of Genesis&lt;&lt;, George Hen- derson suggested a comparison between the depic- tion of the days of creation in the Greek Oc- tateuchs' and that on folios i and 2 of the famous Haggadah of Sarajevo' (Figs. I &amp; 2). Closer atten- tion to individual details of the Sarajevo miniatures does indeed reveal not only a strong resemblance between them and, more specifically, certain fea- tures of the eleventh-century Greek Octateuch of the Vatican Library, Codex graecus 7473, but also an even stronger relationship to individual features of the ninth-century illustrated version of that sixth-century work known as the Christian To- pography of Cosmas Indicopleustes, Codex graecus 6994, also of the Vatican Library. In addi- tion, it will become apparent in the following analysis that other Western European manuscripts preserve some of these same distinctive features and that the Sarajevo Haggadah may provide some unique insights relevant to the kinds of models available to artists in northern Europe during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries if not even ear- lier. The creation cycle of the Sarajevo manuscript be- gins at the upper right of fol. i (Fig. 2) with the spirit of God5 represented as tongues of golden flame against the darkness of night hovering over the waters of chaos below (Gen. 1:1-2). Following the direction of the Hebrew script in the titulus above, the next scene to the left, that of the creation of light and the separation of light from darkness (Gen. 1:3-4), and thus the creation of day and night (Gen. i:5), bears an interesting resemblance to the depiction of the same event on fol. 15 of Vat- ican graecus 747 (Fig. 3) with two exceptions. First of all, the Vatican image shows Day and Night per- sonified, respectively, as a torch-bearing and veil- ed figure, both of whom are absent in the Sarajevo * This article is an outgrowth of research for a book I am completing on Genesis illustration in medieval England conducted with the aid of a Fellowship for Independent Study and Research from the National Endowment for the Humanities. I would like to express my gratitude to the En- dowment and also to the Research Foundation of the City University of New York for making this work possible. I would also like to thank Professor Joseph Gutmann who very generously read an earlier version of this paper and was of great assistance in obtaining photographs of the Sarajevo miniatures.

Ephraem Syrus in a commentary on Genesis also translates the ruah of God (Gen. 1:2) as the ,wind&amp;, and says that the reference has nothing to do with the tradi- tional Christian interpretation of the Spirit of God as the Holy Spirit; see T.

Personifications of both Night and Day are missing in the eleventh-century Florence Octateuch, Bibl. Laurenziana MS Plut. V. 38, fol. 2v, on which see V. Lazarev, Storia della pittura bizantina, Turin, 1967, 25o, n. 35. As Weitzmann considers graecus 747 the Oc- tateuch closest to the archetype (see, The Joshua Roll, 30-38), it would seem probable that the archetype con- tained these personifications.

I (Fig. i) where the events of the sec- ond day (Gen. i:6-8) are depicted, the separation of the waters above from the waters below by the creation of a firmament which God calls heaven (Gen. 1:8). In this third compartment of the Sarajevo image we see the sphere or circle of the earth half filled with water, while golden rays from above, pre- sumably the voice of the Creator, stream down from the four shaded semi-circles referred to ear- lier. The sphere of the earth is now framed by a round-topped rectangular form whose shape is de- fined by a thin white line, which is in turn en- hanced by a series of white dots along its inner bor- der. This schema is repeated several times in dif- ferent permutations throughout the illustrated copies of the Christian Topography of Cosmas In- dicopleustes7 (Fig. 6) where it is meant to repre- sent the universe, which, as described in Cosmas' text, is divided in half horizontally by the firma- ment of Genesis i:8 with heaven above and the earthly realm below8. Wanda Wolska-Conus, in her monograph on the Topography, discusses in detail the iconographic problems of correctly interpreting this symbolic form which she calls, translating Cosmas, the &gt;&gt;cote etroit du Kosmos&lt;&lt;9. Briefly summarized, the problems are the following. According to Cosmas' text, this &gt;&gt;cote' troit&lt;&lt; is meant to represent the short end, as opposed to the longer sides, of his rectangular double-decker schema of the universe. This schema, according to Cosmas, is based on the bipartite division of the ancient wilderness Taber- nacle of the Jews. As Wolska-Conus points out, however, the Tabernacle, in Cosmas' text as well as in the accompanying diagrams, is divided in half longitudinally, in plan, rather than horizontally in section, and is shown in all the illustrations with- 7 See footnote 4 above; fols. 38v &amp; io8r in Vatican Codex graecus 699; fols. 91r &amp; 195v in Florence, Laurenziana MS Plut.

The round-topped rec- tangle of Cosmas' diagram, as Wolska-Conus points out, bears a closer resemblance to depic- tions of the Ark of the Covenant in all three illus- trated versions of the Topography and the two Vat- ican Octateuchs'o (Fig. 7). A similar round-topped chest appears in ancient Jewish art where, depend- ing on the context, it can also be meant to represent a Torah chest or shrine". Philo interpreted the Ark of the Covenant as a symbol of the intelligible world, and was, accord- ing to Wolska-Conus, the first to suggest that the Tabernacle/Temple was in all its appurtenances a symbol of the universe". In his Antiquitates Judaicae, Josephus specifically states that the raison d'etre of every object in the Temple is to im- itate and signify the cosmos'3. In her final analysis of Cosmas' schema of the &gt;&gt;short side&lt;&lt; of the uni- verse (Fig. 6), Wolska-Conus concludes that for Cosmas, by way of a concatenation of related ideas and images, the conglomerate of Tabernacle/Ark/ Torah-shrine came to symbolize one and the same thing, i.e. the cosmos itself'4. In their depictions of the creation of the universe, recent opinion has suggested that the artists of that second major branch of Octateuch illustration 4. Vatican Library, Codex graecus 747- fol.

Exodus 25:IO-22; 37:1-9), but appears in Jewish art since the time of Bar Kochba's tet- radrachmas (A. D. I32-35), its presence in the illus- trated versions of the Topography as well as the two Vat- ican Octateuchs and the Octateuchs of Smryna and the Seraglio, but not the Joshua Roll, provides an important filial link between these manuscripts, other aspects of which are discussed by L. Brubaker, *The Tabernacle Miniatures of the Byzantine Octateuchs&lt;, in XVe Con- gres international des etudes byzantines, Athens, 1976, (publ. 1981), 73-92. See also D.

Carl-Otto Nordstr6m, *The Water Miracles of Moses in Jewish Legend and Byzantine Art&lt;, Orientalia Suecana, VII, i958, 84-86, reprinted in No Graven Im- ages: Studies in Art and the Hebrew Bible, ed. J. Gut- mann, New York, 1971, 277-308, has suggested that the form of the Ark of the Covenant as we see it in the Oc- tateuchs is based on that of the Torah-shrine by virtue of the fact that in illustrations of Deut. 31:26 in those manuscripts the Ark is shown with doors, one of which is open (see Nordstr6m, fig. i), thus, in a second detail in addition to its rounded top mentioned above, not conforming to the text of the Bible, which makes no mention of doors. Here Nordstr6m reconfirms Krael- ing's original opinion that in the representations of the Ark in the Dura synagogue paintings it was given the form of the Torah-shrine (see Nordstr6m, 84, notes i- 3)- In this connection, see also J.

The &gt;short side&lt; of the Universe from the Topographia Christiana of Cosmas Indicopleustes lustrations of the Topography as a source of inspi- ration'5. As an example of the rejection of the 747 archetype, Cynthia Hahn offers the miniature of the sixth day of creation on folio i7r of that man- uscript which, in its depiction of a circular earth, departs radically from the schema encountered in the other Octateuchs'6 which show the earth in- stead as a rectangle. The circularity of the earth was one of the principal concepts of Hellenistic science to which Cosmas in his Topography was deeply opposed'7. Cosmas proposes instead, and this is made clear in the accompanying diagrams, a rec- tangular earth culminating toward the center in a great mountain and separated from the round-top- ped vault of heaven, based again on the bipartite division of the wilderness Tabernacle, by the hori- zontal division of the firmament'8 (Fig. 8). Several distinctive features of the creation miniatures in the Seraglio, Smyrna, and Vatican (746) Oc- tateuchs, as Hahn points out, such as the rectangu- lar plan of the earth and Cosmas' great central mountain, have more in common with the illustra- tions of the Topography than they do with those of Vatican graecus 747'9 Returning to the Sarajevo series (Figs.

Vatican Library, Codex graecus 746 - fol. 23 Ir. The Ark of the Covenant can now see that the general configuration of the universe exhibits a combination of features to be seen in both the Topography and the Vatican Oc- tateuch (747) illustrations. The Sarajevo cycle re- peats the round-topped Tabernacle/Ark/Torah- shrine configuration of the Topography without, however, the horizontal division of the firmament found in Cosmas' schema. This general frame of the universe in Sarajevo shares with the Octateuch image (Fig. 5) the circularity of the earth and, in the first panel at the upper right of fol. 2 (Fig. 2), the placement of the discs of the sun and moon at left and right, although again Sarajevo lacks the personified imagines clipeatae of the Octateuch20. Unlike the Octateuch image as well, the stars are located in Sarajevo above the round-topped upper limit of the firmament (Fig. 2) among what are probably meant as four of the seven planetary spheres of classical antiquity or, possibly, four of the seven heavens mentioned frequently in Jewish apocalyptic and midrashim"2 and often depicted in a manner similar to what we see in Sarajevo in later sixteenth and seventeenth-century illustrated Rus- sian and Greek versions of the Topography22. The circle of the earth at the bottom left of fol. i in Sarajevo (Fig. i) shows the separation of the from time to time the schema of representing that same star-filled firmament as the bottom quarter of a separate sphere located at the top of a miniature as on fol. i9r of the manuscript, illustrated on page I19 of Lassus, ,La creation&lt;(. The various types of cosmic representations are discussed by A. Grabar, &gt;&gt;L'Iconographie du ciel dans Part chretien de l'Antiquite et du haut Moyen Age&lt;&lt;, Cahiers archedologiques, 30. 1982, with special ref- erence to the Octateuchs on pages 12-16. 20 Metzger, Haggada enluminde, 310-3x3 notes that the sun, which was created first, is represented at the right on fols. I &amp; 2 of Sarajevo, and that the moon, following the direction of the Hebrew script, appears next at the left. 21 See L.

The Universe from the Topographia Christiana of Cosmas Indicopleustes waters from the dry land and the appearance of vegetation, all of which indicates the work of the third day (Gen. 1:9-13). The work of the fourth day, the creation of the sun, moon, and the stars (Gen. 1:14-19) begins the series of miniatures at the upper right of fol. z (Fig. z). One detail of this miniature has caused some puzzlement, namely the fact that the golden rays meant no doubt as the creative voice of God in the two preceding and two following miniatures, rise up from the circle of the earth on the fourth day rather than showering down from the vault of the firmament above"3. This configuration might be intended to illustrate the words of Genesis 2:5-6: &gt;&gt;And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground. But there went up a mist from the earth, and wa- tered the whole face of the ground.&lt;&lt; In the Pirke of Rabbi Eliezer this last verse is explained and related to the words of Psalm 42:7- Semantrons4, Cahiers archdologiques, XXI, 1971, 213- 228, as well as, *Die Namen Noes, seines Bruders und seiner Frau: ein Beitrag zum Nachleben jiidischer Ober- lieferungen in der ausserkanonischen und gnostischen Literatur und in Denkmiler der Kunst4, Abhandlungen der Akademie der Wissenschaften in G6ttingen, philo- hist.

The specific configuration of seven semi-circular concentric heavens rising above the vault of the firma- ment framing a semicircular earth is also to be found in an un-inked-in dry-point sketch on fol. 78r of a Sephardi manuscript of ca. mid-i14th-century date in the collection of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York known as the *Prattoa Hag- gadah, MIC49478.

The second panel at the upper left of fol. 2 in Sarajevo (Fig. 2) shows the work of the fifth and sixth days, the creation of fish and fowl (Gen. 1:20-23) as well as the beasts of the earth (Gen. i:24-25). An interesting detail here is the large fish swimming prominently in the waters no doubt al- luding to the &gt;&gt;great sea monsters? of Genesis 1:21, a significant feature of earlier medieval creation cy- cles'5. In the larger panel at the bottom right of fol. 2, corresponding diagonally to the equally large panel of the first day directly opposite on fol. I, the Sarajevo artist has depicted the creation of Adam and his dominion over the animals (Gen. 1:26) in a manner quite similar to that in the two Vatican Octateuchs, especially graecus 747 (fol. 19) where Adam sits up on the earth in response to the divine rays streaming down from above26. It should be remarked here that the days of creation in Sarajevo are distinctive in that they are &gt;&gt;cumula- tive&lt;&lt;, i.e. each successive disc subsumes the work of the preceding days. The Sarajevo cycle concludes with the rest of the seventh day at the lower left, represented by a seat- ed figure under a trefoil arch originally identified by von Schlosser as the Creator resting from his work (Gen. 2:2-3), but in subsequent studies of the manuscript described as an image of a pious Jew observing the Sabbath7. It has been assumed by all previous students of the Sarajevo manuscript, beginning with Miiller and von Schlosser, that, with the exception of a limited number of distinctive, no doubt Jewish features28, its prefatory miniatures, especially those of the Creation, were adapted from a Gothic Christian prototype of the kind.represented by the Bible Historide of the John Rylands Library, Man- chester (French MS 5) or the Arsenal Bible in Paris (Bibl. de l'Arsenal Cod. 5211, fol. 3v). Such an adaptation would have involved the deletion of the anthropomorphic figure of the Creator so promi- nent in the Christian examples and the substitution at the seventh day in Sarajevo of the seated figure 24 G. Friedlinder (transl.), Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer: the Chapters of Rabbi Eliezer the Great, London, 1916, 29- 30. s5 Cf., for example, the enormous fish at the bottom of the miniature on fol. 3v of the mid-eleventh century illus- trated Hexateuch of Aelfric (London, British Library Cotton MS Claudius B. IV) reproduced in the facsimile edited by C. R. Dodwell &amp; P. Clemoes, The Old Eng- lish Illustrated Hexateuch, (= EEMFS, i8), Copenha- gen, 1974. The size of the fish in both cases may be a ref- erence to the midrashic tradition concerning the crea- tion of Leviathan and Behemoth on the fifth day; cf. Targum Neophyti I, ed. A.

Yet none of the examples brought forward thus far as possible prototypes for the Sarajevo cycle pre- serves the distinctive round-topped rectangular configuration of the firmament in conjunction with a circular earth and the indication above of the seven concentric heavens or planetary spheres with sun and moon at left and right. We do not as yet have sufficient knowledge of the origins and development of illustrated Haggadah cycles to be able to come to any definitive conclusions about the ultimate nature of the source or sources drawn upon by the artists responsible for their produc- tion30. We can, however, make some useful obser- vations based on our foregoing analysis of the cre- ation cycle in Sarajevo. First of all, there are contemporary and earlier creation cycles from the Christian realm, as well as later examples, that share traces of the distinctive features we have isolated in the Sarajevo sequence in addition to the Vatican Octateuch (747) and To- pography manuscripts already mentioned. For example, the mid-thirteenth-century so-called ,Maciejowski Bible&lt; (New York, Pierpont Mor- gan Library MS 638) fols. i &amp; iv (Fig. 9) exhibits a creation cycle with circular earth containing suc- cessively the &gt;cumulative&lt; work of the six days"3. While a standing Creator and numerous angels are quite prominent, there is in the frames above the first, second, fifth and sixth days (Fig. 9) a cen- tralized semicircle/arch above the circular earth. This arch, however, is not the firmament as this is indicated within the circles of the successive days. Harvey Stahl, in the most recent comprehensive study of the manuscript, has associated many of its miniatures, although not specifically the creation cycle, with the iconographic tradition represented by the middle Byzantine Octateuchs, and has I1. Paris, Bibliotheque nationale, Ms. Fr. 20090 - fol. 3r (det.). The work of the fourth day suggested the possibility of the existence in the West of an early, perhaps Latin-based Octateuch ,recension&lt; combining elements previously as- sociated exclusively with either the Cotton Genesis tradition or the Byzantine Octateuchs32.

We might see in this arch, however, a vestige of the round-topped rectangle of the Tabernacle/Ark/ Torah-shrine schema of the universe altered to suit the purposes and understanding of the fourteenth- century English artist. Related to the Egerton Genesis in a number of ways is an interesting &gt;Picture Bible&lt;&lt; from Padua (split between Rovigo, Bibl. Acc. dei Concordi MS 212 and London, British Library, MS Add. 15277) also of the fourteenth century which in its creation cycle on folios i and iv exhibits a series of rectan- gular compartments illustrating the hexameron with a prominent circular earth, above which are the very distinct traces of an arch similar to both the Vatican Octateuch (747) and Sarajevo35. Our final example, a late fourteenth-century French Bible Historiale (Paris, Bibl. Nat. Ms Fr. 20090)36 provides additional evidence not only of the round-topped rectangular schema of the firma- ment, but also the seven concentric heavens with sun and moon at left and right as well.

Ir, upon close examination, faint traces of orange, yellow, and blue can be made out on this arc. A similar tripartite rainbow-arch with an identically situated figure of Christ showing his wounds as Judge at the last day can be seen within the letter D on folio I2or of the fourteenth-century St. Omer Psalter (Lon- don, British Library Add. MS 398Io), reproduced as pl. I4d in Picht, &gt;&gt;Giottesque&lt;&lt;, 62. The late fifth-century Vergilius Romanus in the Vati- can Library (Cod. Vat. Lat. 3867) on fol. 23 5r, repro- duced in E. Rosenthal, The Illuminations of the Ver- gilius Romanus (Cod. Vat. Lat. 3867): A Stylistic and Iconographical Analysis, Zurich, 1972, pl. VII, and pp. 47-50, exhibits a similarly tripartite, rainbow-like arch, above which at left and right are the sun and moon while the seated gods below are surrounded by tiny stars. It is not altogether clear that, as Grabar, &gt;&gt;L'icono- graphie du ciel&lt;&lt;, (see note 19 supra), pp. 12-1 5 maintains, the upreared arch of the firmament on folios 15 v (Fig. 4) or i6v (Fig. 5) of the Vatican Octateuch, graecus 747, necessarily represents only a segment of a much larger complete circle. On the contrary, based on the evidence of the illustrations in the Florence Octateuch (Lauren- ziana MS Plut. IX. 28), especially fols. 2v and 3r, illus- trated in Lassus, &gt;&gt;La creation&lt;&lt;, p. io6 and pl. II, E re- spectively, as well as the text of the Topography, which states that the first, or visible Heaven, in the form of a vault, is attached to the extremities of the earth (see Las- sus, &gt;&gt;La creation,&lt;, p. io5, n. 20), it is also possible that in utilizing the upreared arch of the firmament in the drawings on fols. 15v and i6v, the artist or artists re- sponsible for these drawings in Vatican Cod. graecus 747 were making reference to the round-topped rectan- gular schema of Cosmas' Christian Topography (see note I9 supra). It is thus quite possible that the &gt;&gt;ciel du Dieu circulaire&lt;&lt; identified by Grabar, &gt;&gt;L'icono- graphie&lt;&lt;, p. I5, can exist simultaneously with the up- reared arch of the firmament as it does on fol. I4v of Vatican Cod. graecus 747 (illustrated in Lassus, &gt;&gt;La creation?, p. 98). This combined format, then, of the circular &gt;&gt;ciel du Dieu&lt;&lt; above the upreared arch of the firmament, a mod- ified version of Cosmas' horizontally divided &gt;&gt;cot6 6troit du Kosmos&lt;&lt;, is what we see in the so-called &gt;&gt;Sec- ond Coming&lt;&lt; panel of the fifth-century carved wooden doors of Santa Sabina in Rome, illustrated on page 487 of K. Weitzmann, ed. Age of Spirituality: Late Antique and Early Christian Art, Third to Seventh Century. (catalogue), New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1978. On the doors as a whole, see G. Jeremias, Die Holztiir der Basilika von S. Sabina auf dem Aventin zu Rom, Tiibingen, 1980. Interestingly, the sun is rep- resented to the right of the round-topped rectangle of the universe on this panel of the doors and the moon to the left as in Sarajevo; see note 20 above. 35- For illustrations, see G.

In light of these examples, it would seem reason- able to suggest that the artist of the Sarajevo cycle had access to an illustrated Genesis, perhaps even more likely, a Pentateuch37, having a creation cycle similar in some ways to that preserved in part in the Vatican Octateuch graecus 747, certain fea- tures of which38 also appeared in the archetype of the illustrated Christian Topography of Cosmas Indicopleustes, its lineal descendants39, and a group of Western, Latin manuscripts represented by such examples as the Maciejowski Bible, the Egerton Genesis, and the Rovigo Bible40. We can- not know whether the Sarajevo artist had access to the archetype itself or one of its descendants.

H. L. Kessler, Chicago, 1971, 90-93. The existence of a Western biblical cycle, at least for the book of Genesis, has also been proposed combining elements from the so-called Cotton Genesis recension and that of the middle Byzantine Octateuchs, as well as iconographic motifs found in neither tradition as we presently know them; see R. Bergman, The Salerno Ivories: Ars Sacra from Medieval Amalfi, Cambridge (Mass.), 1980, 45-47. For an early combination of such Octateuch-Cotton Genesis motifs at least by the fourth century A. D., see L. K6tzsche-Breitenbruch, Die neue Katakombe an der Via Latina in Rom: Untersuchungen zur Ikonographie der alttestamentlichen Wandmale- reien, Miinster, 1976, esp. io6-io8. F. Miitherich, *Die Stellung der Bilder in der friihmittelalterlichen Psalteril- lustration,, in Der Stuttgarter Bilderpsalter, II, Stutt- gart, 1968, i75 had already demonstrated the exis- tence of both cycles in the West certainly by the ninth century if not earlier; see also Stahl, *Morgan 638&lt;, 20, 69, 90, 138, n. 253. 41 Cf.

A final question - did the Sarajevo artist under- stand the Tabernacle/Ark/Torah-shrine implica- tion of the original iconographic motif with which we began this paper? It is well worth remembering that the preliminary sequence of illustrations in the Sarajevo manuscript ends with a scene of worship- ers leaving the Synagogue service43 (Fig. 12). There the solemn, cowled figures pass quietly through a large arch which in turn frames the round-topped Torah-shrine within containing three veiled scrolls, whose two doors are about to be shut by the small figure at the left. Again, earlier in the cycle (Fol. 32) is to be seen a representation of the Messianic Temple with the Tablets of the Law44 surmounted by cherub wings and framed by a centrally place scallop-filled arch45. At the very least, such an arched compartment possessed an aulic, honorific connotation46, and, as we actually see a round-topped Torah-shrine earlier in the manuscript (Fig. 12), no doubt also held for the Sarajevo artist a specific cosmic connotation as he emphasizes it in his introductory creation minia- tures. Perhaps to the Christian artists of the kind of prototypes on which the Sarajevo artist also re- lied the round-topped image of the universe as Tabernacle/Ark/Torah-shrine had ceased to be of any significance, but as with details of a legendary or midrashic origin to be found elsewhere in this and other Haggadot was perfectly well under- stood by the Sarajevo artist and included by him from his models47. reprinted in J. Gutmann, ed., No Graven Images - Studies in Art and the Hebrew Bible, New York, 1971, 249-60.

Hoffmann, Taufsymbolik im mittelalterlichen Herrscherbild, Dusseldorf, 1968, 34-35 has argued for knowledge in the West, at least in the tenth century, of Cosmas' schema of the &gt;short side&lt;&lt; of the universe, as this is how he interprets the round-topped rectangular frame on fol. 16r of the Evangelistery of Otto III (Aachen, Domschatz), pl. 3. Interestingly enough, this round-topped rectangular compartment in the Aachen manuscript is outlined along its inner border in white dots just like the Sarajevo creation cycle frames. The significance of the &gt;&gt;short side&lt;&lt; schema as a symbol of the universe was kept alive in the 15th to 17th-cen- tury illustrated Russian and Greek Cosmas manuscripts discussed and illustrated by Rjedin (see note 22 above) and appears quite prominently in the border of a six- teenth-century icon from the P.
