<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paul Nash London by MARINA VAIZEY in order to entice more visitors, since its updating and gende expansion in 2000 by Rick Mather, the Dulwich Picture Gallery, London, has imaginatively complemented its magnificent holdings with a highly intelligent series of special exhibitions, usually devoted to unexpected, little-explored and at times eccentric subjects. Its current exhibition, Paul Nash: The Elements (to 9th May),1 devoted to the paintings, drawings, photographs and prints from all periods of Nash's career, is a typical example. The Gallery contains only pre-1900 paintings (primarily Dutch, Flemish, French and British) and no drawings or prints. The eclectic special exhibition programme thus has a three-fold thrust, focusing on an intellectual expansion: selections from other major collections, often from abroad, includ ing a very welcome emphasis on classic Amer ican art (for example, Winslow Homer or the graphic artist Saul Steinberg); drawings; small scholarly exhibitions related to the col lection (Gerrit Dou); and shows obliquely focusing on established twentieth-century British artists (for example Sickert in Venice). It is to the last informal category that the current quirky, idiosyncratic and genuinely illumi nating look at Paul Nash belongs, and it is this context which helps make it an unusually refreshing anthology. Nash was a polymath: a masterly print maker; a designer of textiles; a quiedy savage artist of both World Wars; a book designer and illustrator; a writer; and, perhaps above all, a British Surrealist. He was an inventive practitioner of collage, interested in the use of</page><page sequence="2">EXHIBITIONS ^^^^^^ 53. Wall against the sea, by Paul Nash. 1922. Canvas, 61 by 88.9 cm.

Dulwich Picture Gallery, London). found objects, and, from the 1930s, an inspired photographer whose use of the camera (exclusively the Kodak No.2) is still insufHciendy recognised. The selection of his photographs chosen by his widow, Margaret, and first published with an introduction by James Laver in 1951, was apdy titled Fertile Image. Andrew Causey, author of the cat alogue raisonn? of Nash's work, reminds us that Nash wrote in 1932 of 'the peculiar power of the camera to discover formal beau ty which ordinarily is hidden from the human eye', and that from then on he was deter mined to find in his art a way of'revealing the ubiquitous vitality he felt in natural things'.2 It is that expressive vitality, a sense of repressed energy being exposed to creative and illuminating effect, that the current exhi bition seems to be dedicated. To this end, the show's curator, David Fraser Jenkins, has produced perhaps a rather forced thesis: that the contrast between almost warring or con tradictory elements is the basis for much of Nash's imagery. Shelter and cultivation con trast with wildness, a pathway with the uncharted, chaos with order, threat with safe ty, and sometimes an image is invented that simply confounds expectations. We see this, for example, in Wall against the sea (no.23; Fig.53), in representations of Dymchurch, at times inventively abstracted as in the drawing Night tide, Dymchurch (1922; no.24). Striking contrast is evident in the writhing sensuality of the painting Convolvulus (1930; no.33), which shows a plant set against a series of receding arches, and in Swanage (no.48; Fig. 5 4), in which photographs of found objects - stones, flints and the like - act as a miniature deconstructed Stonehenge and are set against washes of colour suggesting a visionary landscape complete with low-lying moon. Some images are seen as representing refuges, notably the recurring theme of the Wittenham clumps, those clusters of beech trees marking prehistoric sites at the apex of small hills in Oxfordshire. Thus what is presented is the art of Paul Nash in a different guise. Earlier exhibitions have included the major retrospective at the T?te (1975; followed by an Arts Council tour of England), which was arranged chrono logically, the exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum devoted to Nash as designer (and for many of his designs, Freudians would have a field day), and the superb Aerial Crea tures, Paul Nash and the Second World War at the Imperial War Museum (1996-97), while seven years ago an excellent chronological survey of landscapes was shown at T?te Liverpool (subtitled 'Modern Artist, Ancient Landscape'). But the current anthology is markedly dif ferent. Subtiding it 'The Elements' is curi ously jolting, making his art much more overtly bold. Nash is often resolutely muted in terms of colour, although always (con sciously) disturbing in terms of composition, revealing something very strange and quietly and subversively original, but he is never stri dent. Concentrating on contrasts, some trans parently useful visual idioms are occasionally perhaps given more symbolic weight than they can bear: the second chapter, 'A Path Through the Elements', neatly shows Nash's subtle use of just that: The wanderer (1911; no. 18) in which the figure makes his way through high grass towards a clump of trees (might these not be a refuge?). The litho graph Marching at night (no.21; Fig.5 5) shows a robotic procession at a slightly oblique angle towards the viewer, corning towards us down a dramatically foreshortened road, framed by sharply stylised trees: almost a satirical look at the avenues of great estates, but also a realis tic echo of the landscape of northern France over which the gruesome battles of the First World War were fought. Yet the pathway as a pictorial device is markedly present in sev enteenth-century Dutch landscapes, almost inevitably criss-crossed by paths and roads taking the eye in. Even more original are the sequence of flooded rooms, where conventional rooms replete with fractured decoration are indeed rather neatly represented in fragmented form, interior walls slightly tip-tilted on a gende diagonal. In Harbour and room (1931; no. 11) the eye is swept past details of a drawing room ? corniced ceiling, marble fireplace, striped wallpaper, elaborate mirror, a trapezoid of panelled floor - to take in the surprise of much of the space, internal and external, being occupied by pier and water. Empty room (1935; no. 12), another watercolour, shows sea wall and waves dramatically outfacing panelled floor and wall, with a tree stump emerging from the wooden floor. These are part of a sequence labelled 'Ele ments in Conflict'. More accurately it might be said the 'elements' are in contrast. One of 54. Swanage, by Paul Nash. ^^^3(Rk C.193?.

Lithograph, 51.3 by 42 cm. (Victoria and Albert Museum, London; exh. Dulwich Picture Gallery, London). Nash's undoubted masterpieces, We are mak ing a new world (Imperial War Museum; no.9), is a hideous yet eerily beautiful depiction of blasted and ruined tree stumps, trunks with drooping branches, like the corpses of some peculiar animal, held upright by the rolling mounds of mud and flooded trenches. In the background, like a stage backdrop, are higher hills and a moon iUuminating a grey sky with its diagonal rays. The whole is quietly unre lieved horror, an extraordinary contrast to one of Nash's Second World War master pieces, Totes Meer (no.71), a view of the Home Front, a moonlit frozen sea of the body parts of downed German planes. This is some thing he witnessed just outside Oxford. His own relatively straightforward photographs formed the basis of the imagery he then trans formed into paint. But Totes Meer is displayed in the last room of the exhibition, and is part of the fourth chapter in the catalogue, under the rubric 'Elements in Harmony'. Is this because of a sense of the moonlit sea, albeit that the waves are ruined aircraft? Nash's world is described in Simon Grant's catalogue essay as 'inextricably linked to a spirit of place [...] expressed through an Eng lish blend of Surrealism and neo-Roman ticism'. Presumably Surrealism is the finding of the familiar in an unfamiliar context, and Neo-romanticism has as a central tenet the anthropomorphism of landscape: of both these Nash was a master. Because Nash's palette is relatively quiet, his surface textures matter of fact and his scale modest, his work has commanded a stream of steady admirers, rather than conquering the heights. Although the thesis of the Dulwich exhibition may be a trifle forced, it does succeed on several levels. The juxtaposition of compositions under various rubrics ? conflict, refuge, harmony ? has as its corollary the abandonment of chronology so that works are seen in unex pected groupings rather than in a time-based procession. The subtleties of the kind of delayed shock that so much of Nash's work provides are made ever more vivid. A fas cinating innovation both on the wall labels and in the catalogue is to remind us for each work how old Nash was at the time it was made, and in the catalogue both contemporary and historic comments on individual works taken from a variety of publications makes for wonderfully intriguing glosses. David Fraser Jenkins and his team have presented a seem ingly familiar artist, still underrated, in a new and fascinating framework: the spectator may argue with the various categories but will be made to look and think again. 1 Catalogue: Paul Nash: The Elements.

This exemplary publication is superbly designed, a fitting compliment to Nash's own outstanding talent as designer. The essays are well argued and written with unusual clarity. Contemporary photographs and comparative illustrations are judicious ly employed, there is a good and succinct bibliography and the whole is well indexed. 2 P. Nash: Fertile image, ed. M.
