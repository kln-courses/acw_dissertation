<plain_text><page sequence="1">Introduction: Humans, Animals, and Machines Michael Lynch Brunel University H. M. Collins Cardiff University This special issue of Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values is a selection of papers from the Fourth Bath Quinquennial Science Studies Workshop held in July 1995. Like earlier workshops on New Perspectives in the History and Sociology of Science (1980), The Uses of Experiment (1985),' and The Rediscovery of Skill (1990), the 1995 workshop was organized around a theme that was a focus of interest and debate among philosophers, historians, sociologists, and others in the interdisciplinary field of science and technol- ogy studies. In this case, the theme was the relationship between Humans, Animals, and Machines (HAM). As might be expected, the papers at the workshop were diverse, but the debates that followed many of the presentations were lively and focused. The theme turned out to inspire coherent thought and argumentation. Many of the participants were enthusiastic about putting together a collection of articles as a theme section of a science studies journal. The conference organizers agreed to handle the task of soliciting, criticizing, and selecting a group of papers to submit to the journal for review. This eventually resulted in the collection of articles in this issue. Before discussing the specific articles, it may be useful to say a word about the background of the HAM theme. Background Debates about humans, animals, and machines are endemic to modem philosophy and also have fundamental significance in the social and cogni- tive sciences. Rene Descartes set the stage for many of the problems and debates today, such as those around the mind-body problem, the problem of consciousness, the question of animal mind, and the idea of artificial intelli- Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values, Vol. 23 No. 4, Autumn 1998 371-383 ? 1998 Sage Publications Inc. 371</page><page sequence="2">372 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values gence. Descartes accepted and promoted the emerging seventeenth-century mechanical philosophy. He was impressed by the technological develop- ments of his day and was particularly fascinated with the mechanical toys that were popular fixtures in aristocratic estates and public clock towers. Many of these toys were wooden or brass models of animal and human figures, animated by hidden hydraulics, springs, and pendulum and gear mechanisms. He concluded that the mechanical principles that governed these simulacra would also explain the behavior of "thoughtless brutes" (nonhuman animals) and the movements and physiology of the human body. He insisted, however, that even the most sophisticated elaboration of mechan- ics would never be sufficient to explain the human ability to use language and react to the contingencies of life (Dear 1998, 67). The mechanical philosophy reduces all material phenomena to micro- mechanical, mathematically organized causes, and distinguishes those "pri- mary" constituents from "secondary" effects such as color and texture which are imposed upon reality by the mind of the beholder. Descartes' particular version of that philosophy explained all physical effects as resulting from the size, shape, motion, and interaction of insensible bits of matter (Shapin 1996, 47). He radically separated the material, mechanical world from the meta- physical domain of the ego cogito and placed human anatomy and physiology together with the material things of the world. For Descartes, the mind was composed of an immortal, ethereal "substance" (res cogitans) which existed independently of the mechanical cause-and-effect relations in the material world (res extensa). Descartes treated the mind's self-existence as the ulti- mate ground of certainty, but the mechanistic picture of world and body was no less a part of his dualistic philosophy than it was of the materialistic monism of those who rejected his conception of "glassy essence." By clearly delimiting a domain of physicomechanical operations, Descartes framed subsequent debates about the extent to which human actions can be described by such operations. Materialists like Julien Offray de la Mettrie, who pro- posed an extension of mechanical principles to encompass "Man himself," accepted the micro-mechanical part of Descartes' dualistic picture, but then tried to reduce the other part (the mind) to its terms. Contemporary Debates and Distinctions The Cartesian legacy continues to frame many twentieth-century debates about humans, animals, and machines. Scientific conceptions of the physical universe changed profoundly after the seventeenth century, and now the digital computer and not the mechanical clock is the technological paradigm</page><page sequence="3">Lynch, Collins / Introduction 373 while computationalist models of mind are in the ascendancy. Many philoso- phers find Descartes' mind-body dualism less appealing.2 Nevertheless, the debate between Descartes and de la Mettrie has not disappeared. In the history of the debate, numerous mechanical analogies have been used besides clockwork: hydraulics, telephone exchanges, thermostats, and computers. Biological mechanisms such as neural nets and genetic algorithms have also become popular of late. While these analogies may be associated with exciting scientific discoveries and new technologies, it is by no means completely obvious that computer programs and neural mechanisms give more accurate accounts of human actions than do clocks.3 Perhaps whenever a new type of mechanism is invented, it looks like a model of mind until the next one comes along. De la Mettrie's position is represented in twentieth-century philosophy by continuing attempts to base all valid knowledge of nature, mind, and conduct on physical, evolutionary, neurological, computational, cognitive, and other scientific facts and principles. Although numerous philosophers are associ- ated with this position of scientific monism,4 many of the most forceful spokespersons for it are scientists who profess to have little regard for philosophy. A striking exemplar of this scientistic philosophy was recently written by Sir Frances Crick, famous codiscoverer of the double-helical structure of the DNA molecule. Crick wrote at the beginning of his book The Astonishing Hypothesis (1994, 3): "The Astonishing Hypothesis is that 'You,' your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and your free will, are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules."5 A compu- tationalist variant of this hypothesis would stress the analogy between the microstructure of the brain and the components of a digital computer, or, more abstractly, between the structures of the brain, computer, or any other infor- mation processing system realized in a physical architecture. Philosophers and social scientists no longer invoke Descartes' res cogi- tans, but many of them insist that human actions cannot be reduced to mechanical operations. They are not merely saying that scientists and engi- neers have not yet attained the ultimate goal, they claim that the entire project of reducing "mind" to "mechanisms" is misconceived. In his well-known criticism of artificial intelligence (AI), Hubert Dreyfus (1979) likened pro- gress in that field to an attempt to reach the moon by climbing a ladder, and to support this analogy he described aspects of human reasoning, perception, and language-use which are embedded in existential and cultural contexts that would be inaccessible to a programmed machine with no lived experi- ence. Challenges like that of Dreyfus have been modified and reworked in sociological terms more familiar in the science and technology studies field</page><page sequence="4">374 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values (Collins 1990), and related challenges have also been directed at neurological reductionism (Coulter 1995). The ascendant view on human-animal distinction posits a continuum between "social" creatures such as bees and ants, through creatures that seem to use humanlike language such as dolphins and chimpanzees, to humans. Collins and Kusch (forthcoming) argue that a crucial dividing line should be drawn between entities that can do actions which require social under- standing and those that cannot. It looks as though this line will fall somewhere within the animal kingdom. Perhaps chimpanzees and dolphins can do polimorphic actions, perhaps not. Almost certainly, ants and bees cannot do polimorphic actions, even though they are often described as "social crea- tures."6 And foreseeable machines remain beyond the pale. Collins argues that domestic dogs exemplify the point well: domestic dogs have far better "computers" in their heads than any built from silicon chips, are often brought up within human families, are more than capable of navigating around an obstacle-filled world, but they still cannot be taught to tidy a room. Others might be more sympathetic to dogs.7 But wherever the dividing line falls, for Collins and Kusch, the ability to be socialized-that is, to be able to perform polimorphic actions-remains the crucial dividing line between most hu- mans, on one side, and machines and many or most animals, on the other. It is not our purpose here to defend or contest one or another version of the human-animal-machine relationship, but we will briefly indicate some of the points in contention. Perhaps the major topic in dispute is the distinction between causal mechanisms and social actions. This is related to a series of other distinctions: physical motion/intentional move- ment, behavioral pat- tern /situated act, mechanical cause/cultural rule, vocal behavior/language use, and many others. Cartesian dualism and micromechanical monism are not the only alterna- tives for addressing questions about humans, animals, and machines. Exis- tential phenomenologists and ordinary language philosophers, for example, opposed modern-day variants of the micromechanical philosophy without supporting Cartesian dualism. Unlike Descartes, they did not suggest that human actions implicate an immaterial realm. They stressed the role of language in practical conduct and the primacy of the intersubjective life world, but they saw no necessity to postulate an immaterial res cogitans. However, their arguments did distinguish the proper domains of the natural and human sciences. Edmund Husserl (1970), Martin Heidegger (1977), Ludwig Wittgenstein (1958), Peter Winch (1990), Gilbert Ryle (1954), Alfred Schutz (1964), and other philosophers who resisted technoscientific hegem- ony did not question the adequacy of scientific methods or the correctness of experimental findings in the appropriate areas of research. In different ways,</page><page sequence="5">Lynch, Collins / Introduction 375 they tried to separate the integrity and intelligibility of human actions in an intersubjective life-world from domains in which causal mechanisms operate.8 The mid-twentieth-century philosophers who opposed scientism provided crucial intellectual resources for later developments in the sociology of scientific knowledge. By denying that linguistic meaning can be reduced to referential truth verified by science, and by establishing that the ordinary life-world can be treated as the basis for sensible conduct and not simply an epiphenomenal world of "mere appearances," these philosophers set the stage for more recent social and historical studies of controversies among core sets of scientists, and the ordinary discourse and day-to-day practices among work groups that constitute and adjudicate what counts as science (Collins 1985; Latour and Woolgar 1979; Knorr 1981; Lynch 1985). Ironically, perhaps, later investigations of scientific life-worlds problema- tized the various distinctions that inspired them. They did so by attacking the (alleged) mechanical foundations of the mechanical philosophy. Wittgenstein, Ryle, Winch, and other midcentury opponents of scientism were willing to grant that mechanical explanations were appropriate and effective in many fields of science and engineering. Winch (1990), for example, argued force- fully that mechanical explanations were inappropriate for studies of social behavior, but he presumed that they were appropriate in the natural sciences and engineering. Comparing social scientists with engineers, he stated that the social scientist's "understanding of social phenomena is more like the engineer's understanding of his colleagues' activities than it is like the engineer's understanding of the mechanical system which he studies" (Winch 1990, 88). However, when social scientists began to study the contents of science and turned their attention to scientists' and engineers' understandings of mechanical systems, they found that those understandings were interac- tionally situated and socially distributed. In other words, any individual scientist's or engineer's "understanding" of mechanisms was bound up in relations of trust and assessments of technical competency among members of a network of colleagues and rivals. Consequently, ethnographic and sociohistorical investigations of scientific practices and controversies opened up a new front in the old debates about actions and mechanisms. They did so by observing that truth claims about mechanisms are embedded in disputes among rival research groups, social interactions among colleagues, and textual rhetorics. In some instances (Shapin and Schaffer 1985), such local configurations of trust and controversy have discernible historical connec- tions with broader political conflicts and social divisions. By the time of the second Bath Quinquennial in 1985, it was clear that many classic issues in philosophy of science had been successfully converted into topics of social and historical research. Those attending the workshop</page><page sequence="6">376 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values were confronted by some wag's handwritten sign posted along a winding road leading to the conference center which warned "DANGER: Sociological Turn." More than a decade later it has become clear that the sociological turn was hazardous indeed. In recent years, certain vociferous "defenders of science and reason" have denounced science and technology studies as an unequivocal attack on established scientific knowledge. We certainly do not agree with such denunciations, but we can understand some of the sources of controversy. When Winch and his contemporaries defended ethics, meta- physics, and ordinary social understandings against scientism-a metaphysi- cal program claiming the authority of "science"-their arguments were controversial enough. But they made sure to leave the mechanical philosophy unchallenged in its "proper" domains of science and engineering. Unlike the earlier generation, proponents of the new social and cultural studies of science attack the mechanical philosophy at its home base. An attack on the adequacy of a metaphysical view of the foundations of science is not necessarily an attack on particular scientific results and principles, even when that metaphysical view is vigorously promoted by prominent scientists. There is no question, however, that it has become increasingly difficult to hold on to a distinction between scientific practices and metaphysical con- ceptions of those practices. Some recent criticisms of the "ideology" of mechanistic reductionism challenge the substantive adequacy of specific lines of theory and research in, for example, genetics.9 Other, "postmodern" arguments (Ward 1996) are more sweeping in their efforts to dismantle "boundaries" between science and ideology, physics and metaphysics, and social and natural science. Back eddies, created when proponents of the sociological turn turned their skeptical attention on sociology itself (Woolgar 1988), gave rise to swirls and whirlpools that threatened to drown science and technology studies in endless debates about its own epistemological foundations. Finally, the antireductionist (or irreductionist) tendency was turned against the very category of "human" action that was once the subject of defense against scientism. In a reversal of scientific monism, Latour (1987, 1988) and Callon (1986) describe networks of human and nonhuman "ac- tants." Although the special status of "social" explanation dissolves in the bargain, a grammar of action becomes the lingua franca for encompassing the entire domain of nature-culture. It is not our purpose to review the various debates touched off by such proposals,1? but only to note that they are part of the background for current studies of humans, animals, and machines. Given the current enthusiasm for transgressing or dismantling conceptual boundaries, it may seem that there is little prospect for agreement about our own or anyone else's effort to specify how human actions differ from animal</page><page sequence="7">Lynch, Collins / Introduction 377 behaviors, and how either or both differ from inanimate mechanisms. Once there was an uncontested table of discrete qualities: Entity Ontology Essence Agency Morality Human Being Soul Self-Action Autonomy Animal Brute Flesh Instinct/Habit Dependency Machine Thing Material Mechanism Utility Now these qualities are each the subject of contention. Organized groups lobby for animal rights, and smaller- and less-organized groups raise the banner for "machine rights." Hollywood's penchant for anthropomorphizing animals and machines contributes to the confusion by making talking lions and superintelligent machines seem almost ordinary. Nevertheless, we do think there continues to be a point to an effort to explore and debate the differences. We may not be able to rest easily with a simple table of correspondences between humans and actions, animals and instincts, and machines and mechanisms, but it seems that we cannot live without the distinctions either. They are embedded in our language and conduct. Conse- quently, at least two lines of research can be pursued: one involves further efforts to formulate and clarify general conceptual distinctions, and the other is to examine how particular distinctions are implicated in the actions and conflicts in one or another organizational setting. So, for example, the question of whether human actions can be modeled with algorithms continues to be an interesting subject for general debate, and it is also a topic for historical and social studies of the actual consequences of implementing algorithms to replace or reorganize human conduct in a workplace.11 Simi- larly, questions about animal mind are currently a lively subject of ethical and philosophical debate, and they also have been turned into topics for investi- gations of animal trainers, experimental animal handlers, and field naturalists as they interact with and speak about their animal subjects in practice (Wieder 1980; Hearne 1987; Crist 1998). Both research tendencies were in evidence at the HAM workshop, and they are represented in the selection of articles in this special issue. Some of the articles review and criticize distinctions between humans and animals, humans and machines, animals and machines, or all three, while others explore situated relationships in particular organizational contexts. Most of the studies do both, with differential emphasis, and all of them address familiar conceptual differences, sometimes in surprising ways.</page><page sequence="8">378 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values The Articles Matthew Elton's article "Persons, Animals, and Machines" concisely explores the conceptual logics associated with distinctions between animals and machines, persons and animals, and persons, animals, and machines. This article takes a more comprehensive and systematic approach to the issues than the other articles in this special issue. Elton deploys examples-such as that of a fly that becomes captive to an orderly chemical mechanism to the detriment of its very existence-to elucidate a set of analytical principles. In the tragic instance of the fly, he argues that this bizarre case instructs us that talk of "organisms" is indispensable and irreducible to physicochemical mechanisms. Elton does not simply rehash a set of correspondences (as in the above table); his examples tease out nuances and deepen our under- standing of when it does or does not make sense to speak of intentions, causes, mechanisms, and consciousness. Unlike philosophers in the Cartesian tradi- tion, Elton does not postulate an essential soul; instead, his examples bring us to the point of recognizing recurrent situations in which it is necessary, for example, to speak of organisms rather than mechanisms. Ruud Hendriks's article "Egg Timers, Human Values, and the Care of Autistic Youths" also discusses conceptual distinctions, but unlike Elton he develops an empirical case study that elucidates a specific distinction. Hendriks studies interactions between autistic and nonautistic persons. Autistic com- municative behavior is often likened to the rigid rule-following behavior of a machine, with its lack of attunement to the subtle cues and unique expres- sions in an interpersonal situation. Hendriks describes how counselors inter- act with autistic persons by imposing mechanical schedules of actions that have some of the "mimeomorphic" (Collins and Kusch forthcoming) quali- ties of interactions between humans and machines. But, contrary to the idea that such a mechanized form of interaction between people must be deper- sonalizing, Hendriks argues that it can be a crucial step in the painstaking construction of an autistic person's repertoire of meaningful social activities. This article nicely illuminates how a quality of action that might otherwise be treated as a mark of human/machine difference is subject to surprising (and even "humanizing") transformations in actual circumstances of daily life. Graham Cox and Tony Ashford, in their article "Riddle Me This: The Craft and Concept of Animal Mind," draw upon their considerable experience of working with gundogs and sheepdogs. Like Elton and Hendriks, they exam- ine a conceptual distinction that has a place in a unique setting of interactional conduct. In this case, they situate the animal/human distinction in descrip- tions of sheepdog trials and tracking work. Instead of subjecting "animal</page><page sequence="9">Lynch, Collins / Introduction 379 mind" to either an experimental test or a conceptual analysis, they explicate the way sheepdogs take part in trials of their ability to perform simultaneously in the different spheres of intentionality of the sheep and their human handler. Insofar as the "good dog" successfully becomes part of these contrasting spheres of intentionality, it is performing something very similar in appear- ance to what is typically characterized as moral action. Indeed, descriptions of such performances invariably take on elements of a moral vocabulary, if only as an act of convenience. So, in something of an inversion of the mechanical regimen that humanizes autistic persons, successful work de- pends on handlers trusting their animals with an ability to contend with unique contingencies arising during a trial. Such descriptions may not prove to the satisfaction of a behaviorist skeptic that dogs actually possess complex reasoning capacities, but they demonstrate how such capacities are taken for granted and relied upon as part of a traditional form of life in which dogs are central participants. The two other articles in the collection discuss and present studies of human/machine relations in organizational settings. Julian Orr's article ("Images of Work") is based upon an extended ethnography of day-to-day work of photocopy repair technicians (see Orr 1996). The article touches upon the AI debate and raises general questions about the differences between human skills and programmed actions, but once again the general issues are placed in the context of specific organizations of practice. Orr's major concern is how technicians' routines and methods for learning skills in actual work settings differ from the abstracted versions of instructions and technique preferred by managers. Marc Berg's article critically reviews a large body of work in the field of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), where new ways to design "machines-for-humans" are evolving. Berg investigates how approaches that attempt to realize more democratic and worker-oriented workplaces concep- tualize "humans," "machines," and their interrelation in work practices. He critically investigates the conceptual oppositions between the realms of "technology" and "human work" which he sees as underlying the analytical and political thrust of these approaches, and he recommends a more nuanced examination to the way artifacts (including documents) become constituents of human work practices. Like Hendriks, he observes that the situational inflexibility of organizational artifacts is not always a drawback, and he takes aim at studies in the CSCW literature which assume that inflexible techno- logical systems always restrict human autonomy and fragment human work. The articles in this special issue are diverse, and we would not want to pretend that they exemplify a single theory of the relations among humans, animals, and machines. However, we think that at least two related lessons</page><page sequence="10">380 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values can be taken from them. The first lesson is that conceptual distinctions between human actions and causal mechanisms, between animal and human behavior, and between planned and situated actions are relevant to a broad range of activities. The second is that the significance and political implica- tions of these distinctions have much to do with the social traditions, local interactional arrangements, and organizational cultures in which they are situated. Notes 1. A collection of papers from the 1980 conference was published as a special issue of Social Studies of Science edited by Collins (vol. 11, no. 1, 1981). A collection of the 1985 papers was published in Gooding, Pinch, and Schaffer (1989). 2. For example, Gilbert Ryle's (1949) critique of the Cartesian "ghost in the machine" differs from the legacy of materialist criticisms which reject "mind" as a metaphysical nonentity. Ryle argues that Descartes' conception of mind as a substance is a category mistake. This does not mean that "it" is something insubstantial, any more than a university is insubstantial because it should not be confused with the particular structures of stone, concrete, and brick which compose the university buildings. Ryle's criticisms problematize materialist reductions no less than they problematize Descartes' conception of ethereal substance. 3. See Button et al. (1995, 38 ff.) and Hacker (1987, 10 ff.) for discussions of how the Cartesian legacy influences present-day misconceptions of human activities as mental or cognitive processes. The fatal move is to presume that ordinary expressions for describing actions are names for internal states and processes. 4. Hacker (1996, 265) concisely summarizes the movement in twentieth-century Anglo- American philosophy that resulted in the "scientific" worldview being transformed into a scientistic worldview. 5. This kind of thinking also pervades Wolpert (1992). For a criticism, see Lynch (1996). 6. Deciding where to draw lines or arguing in favor of a human-animal continuum are not the only alternatives for analyzing the relationship between humans and animals. Analyses of how lines are implicitly drawn (or not) in different discursive contexts have been pursued by Hearne (1987) and Crist (1998). As Crist observes, Darwin and other naturalists often used a language of action when describing insects, and more recently ethologists have described bee "languages." Crist explicates the sensibility of such discourse without implying an ontological equivalence between human and nonhuman actions. 7. See the article by Ashford and Cox in this issue. With regard to the matter of tidying up rooms, Graham Cox (personal communication, 23 January 1998) observes that "the problem with some retrievers is to stop them clearing up as it were." He adds that it would not be difficult to train a dog to tidy up children's toys and put them in a box. 8. Husserl (1970) argues that the natural scientific worldview is incomplete, insofar as it cannot comprehend the phenomenological circumstances from which mathematical science extracts its results, and Heidegger (1977) makes a related argument about a reconfiguration of the modem landscape that paves the way for the extraction of the energy that runs the technologies that lay down the pavement. Both see the European sciences and modem technol- ogy as heading for crisis, but neither radically questions the nature-society distinction that sets up the argument.</page><page sequence="11">Lynch, Collins / Introduction 381 9.
