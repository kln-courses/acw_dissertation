H:e is invoked as the " Glowing One " (ghrni).l His own name, Pusan, is connected in the Rg Veda with pusti (nourishment; 4. 3. T; 10. 26. T) and can be taken to signify "the Nourisher."2 H:is own sacrificial offering is gruel (kararnbha, 3.52.7; G.57.3) a very special sacrificial food not given to any other god. Soma, the Elixir of Life, is their of3Tering. Pusan is not ofered any Soma, but he drives one and the same chariot (2. 40. 3; 1. 23. 15) with Soma, that great divinity. Pusan's draught- animal is the goat (6. 55. 3, 4). It climbs the steep and steady path of Pusanns perennial cycle. There he finds hidden treasure (nidhi, 8. 29. 6) and gives wealth in abundance (6. 55.1, 3; 9. 88. 3; 8. 31.11; 1. 89. 6). There he also puts his foot on the two-faced evil one (1.42.4) and he lacerates the heart of every anan (6.53.8), yet he is the herdsman of creation (10.17.3). H:e guides all, the quick and the dead, and leads the bride on earth (10. 85. 37) as he leads the Bride, the Great Goddess in Heaven, whose name is that of the Sun (Surya).

Synonyms for nourishment ( pusti ) are also associated ^rith Pusan such as vaj¢ which means refreshment or also well-being ( 6. 54. 5; 6. 57. 1; 6. 58. 2; 8. 4. 18; 10. 26. 9 ) or Dhoj¢ which again means nourishment (6. 48.14) or id¢ which is liquid, sustaining food offered to the gods and whose Lord if Pusan (idas pati; 6. 58. 4). Another root from which the word Pusan could be de- rived is pu, referring to flame and fire, and meaning '; to purify," to make bright, to enlighten. Px in the sense of flame and fire agrees with Pusan's exclusive attribute aghrni, the glonring. 3 The translations given in the present context differ to some extent from those by Atkins, op. cit., K. F. Geldner, l)er Rig Veda, Harvard University Press, 1951, and others, to whom they are indebted. H:e has been called solar4 and also pastoral, good shepherd and psychopompos 5 the guide of the de- parted, and he has been interpreted on the basis of natural phenomena and liturgically.6 But, while he answers to these qualifications, they neither exhaust, nor do they constitute, his nature which is one and whole, beheld in inner vision and hymned through the Rg Yeda wherever his name occurs. One consistent image of this god, glowing in his ardour throughout his path, turns around with him so that he is beheld in all his aspects in time and eternity. The Sun, the goat, the gruel and the chariot, the right hand of Pusan and his golden beard, his wealth, his golden weapon, his cattle, all these are part of the symbolic picture drawn in verbal images, of the god-reality Pusan, who is present at all times when he is invoked for he is always on the move, surrounds the cosmos, and is in every creature (6. 58. 2). " Alles ATergangliche ist nur ein Gleichnis." Whatever is transitory is but a symbol, be it as firm as this earth and high as is the firmament. The shape of the animal, the body of man in all its parts, and man-made objects, all these are drawn into the picture. There they form part of one composition which paints in detail, in as many configurations as inner vision dictates, the nature and myth of the god. The myths are his actions, their stage is the heart and mind (manas) of the singer and he draws its lineaments in the frame and order of the cosmos which he sees and knows, iil which he lives and is conscious. He sees the Sun's radiant face and glowing orb move on the vault of the sky, and under- stands its radiance, glow and movement as 4 Bergaigne, op. cit., p. 420. This is the traditional Indian view. A resume of the various interpretations is given by Atkins, I. c., pp. 2-8. 5 The obvious association of solar and pastoral traits of Pusan with his function as God of Paths has been seen by H.

Savitr, the Impeller, the causa efficiens "becomes Pusan" (5. 81. S; yamabhth ), the primordial stress that was ante prtnctptum is behald in Pusan, concreted in his ardour, the glowing essence of the Sun, its "sub- stance ante prtnciptum." Savitr is the efficient cause and Pusan the material cause of the Sun that glows and shining moves. Savitr, Pusan and Surya refer to the same symbol in the cosmos, the Sun. It is validated as cause and ef3Tect. The cause is beheld in the effect and is named differ- ently in the salient stages of its transition. The Sun mounts up on the vault of the sky as a surefooted goat climbs a mountain. This move- ment of the sun has its symbol in the goat, which is Pusan's animal; it refers to Pusan's nature in the image of a goat. The goat precedes the horse at the Horse sacrifice, on their way to heaven (1.162.2-3). The horse is a symbol of the sun in manifestation,7 it is preceded by its anovement, which has its image in the goat, for ontologically the movement precedes the thing that moves in ac- cordance with it, in accordance with its pre-estab- lished plan and order. The various images have their substratum in the objects of the senses. These images, however, function in conformity with an order which oper- ates not only in the outer world, the world of the senses, but is realized at the same time within the entire living being of the poet. By his word he gives effect to this twofold stage of his experience. The actors are the gods who move his mind while they move the cosmos. The herdsman of creation, of the entire universe (10.17.3; 6.58.2), is "in- serted in every creature." Pusan takes the course of the Sun in the cycle of the year and he takes the path of redemption in the heart of man. The first is charged with the emotions and realizations of mind and soul (manas), and the second takes on the images of the external world. The polyvalence of each symbol is supported in two constant directions. The one refers to the cosmos and to the immanent and transcendent 7 Horses draw the chariot of Surya. Eorses draw the chariot of Phoibos Apollo. The horse as symbol of the Sun in manifestation figures in 7. 77. 3. presence and activity of divinity, the other refers to the creative, inner world of man, with its two organs of Manas, the " mind-soul " and Dhl, inner vision or intuition and to Brahman, the creative power.8 When, for example, the chariot is spoken of which Pusan, "the most perfect of charioteers," (6.55.2; 6.56.2-3) is driving, the image of the chariot is that of the "vehicle of the Mind-Soul" (manas) and at the same time it is an image of the cosmos as it exists and moves in time while the structure of the chariot comprises the timeless uncreated worlds and the point of their becoming manifest. The symbols operate in both these regions, the one with reference to the inner world of man, the other with reference to the cosmos. These symbols unite and interchange the contents of the two regions by subsuming them to a struc- ture in which both have their home and each has its place. The main image in which the presence and activity of Pusan is invoked is that of his path. The path is circular, that is cyclical, and has two focal points of the god's activity. The circular path with the two decisive points of its course refers to the annual cycle of the sun with the turning points of its course in the depth and dark- ness of the night of the year the one, and the other at the high noon of the year, in midsummer. Pusan glows in his majesty and wrath at the turn- ing point from darkness to light, which is in the depth and he glows with love at the height of the year, the midday of creation. Pusan, the Glowing One, the Nourisher, leads all the way up from the depth to the height, and thence he conducts on the downward path to the point where he has arisen and overcome the darkness. The path (pathi) is aeviternally recurrent time which "like an ever rolling stream (sruti; 1.42.3) bears all its sons away"9 from the peak of Life, the peak of the 8 Manas has the meaning of " mind-soul " or nous, or " intellectus vel spiritus."

Brahman is the power of giving form to the inner vision ( d ht ) or intuition as shown by P. Thieme, Zeitschrift der Deut- schen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, 1952, 15. 91-129. The usual translation of dht as " prayer " does not convey the meaning of the word, although its mood is that of "Andacht." The level of this mood is that of wisdom.

All the while Pusan glows in the ardour of his nature, a steady guide who, on his way, never loses any of his herd, finds hidden treasure and nourishes and ripens all. The path of Pusan will first be traced together with the visions of the pit and of the peak which the path traverses. The chariot of Pu&gt;.san and his draught-animal, the goat, form part of the image of the path of the Glowing God, Pusan, the Nourisher, whose food is kararnbha, the food of Life. 1. PUSANnS PATH AND iI3IRTXPLACES: ;' On the forward [leading] path of paths was Pusan born, on the forward [leading] path of :E[eaven, on the forward [leading] path of Earth. To both dearly beloved abodes he goes, to and fro, knowing the way" (10.17.6). Pusan was born on the path of paths, on the very movement of that path, a child of the road, a wanderer. Pusan has two Birth Stations or halt- ing places whence he moves on, ever anew. Thus he is said to be born twice on his forward path, up " in heaven " and down " on earth." Each time his birthplace is on the forward leading path of paths, in the superlative moment of the path, which is his hour of birth. XEIigh in heaven his ardour10 glows most fervently in the midsummer of the year. Down, on the forward leading path of earth, he is born of old (10. 26. 8), in his inner- most nature. H:e thence proceeds on the upward path. The path of paths, at the beginning and end of his orbit, where he, the wonder-working (1.42.5; 6.56.4), has his fundament of treasure (10.139. 3),11 will here be viewed first. It starts at the midnight hour of the birth of Pusan, when the sun at midwinter is in darkness. The birth of god is first at the H:eights, in heaven, from the source of Light. This Light 1.42.2, 6.49.8, 6.53.1,4, 8.29.6, 10.17.6, 10.59.7 (pathya); sruti, 1.42.3 and yatna, the latter is said of Savitr, who by his movements becomes Pus. an ( 5. 81. 5 ) . 1O dghrnt, '; glowing," is the most frequently employed attribute of Pusan and belongs to him e2cclusively (cf. E. Siecke, Pushan, Mythologische Bibliothek, vol.

Noten, 7-10, p. 352 S and not to Surya or Savitr as held by other scholars. source which is beyond manifestation, has ;;ante princ1,piqzm " broken out of the all engulfing dark- ness (10. 129. 3; tamas). Tamas, the darkness ante principiqzm is an ontological symbol of the ultimate origin of the gods and of the cosmos. The darkness of the midnight hour, on the other hand, is the symbolical night of the year in the cyclical movement of the sun. It refers to the cosmos in operation and, by analogy, to man, the microcosm where the midnight hour is that of the darkness and trials of the spirit. The darkness anfe principiqzm which is prior to the Light is without any definition (10.129.3) whereas the darkness of the Sun's cycle belongs to the Sat. Sat, the Existent, comprises not only the manifest cosmos but also those stages of mani- festation " in principio " which are beyond the visible universe, . e., the phenomenal and the noumenal worlds. Part of the engulfing Darkness (Tamas) sub- sists " apud principiqzm " and outside the Sat (cf. note 15) . Pusan is born at the ELeight where he choses his parents, the Asvins; Pusan is born again at the Depth, in the pit. It is there that he is re-born in his innermost nature, as the Liberator. His second birth in the Depth on his ever renewed, unending path is therefore taken up here first. The two stations, in the extreme South and the estreme North, of his path are Pusan's beloved places of birth. ELe journeys to and fro.l2 He 12 ;As soon as born " a god fulfills the mission for which he is born. Indra, as soon as born drinks for the first time the Soma (3. 48. 2); as soon as born he ;'masters the Seven who found no master" (8.96.16). Lord Buddha, too, as soon as born, took the seven steps. The two symbolical journeys, the way of the gods (de- vaydna) and the way of the Fathers (pttryana) are described in Brhadaranyaka Upanisad 6. 2.15-16; Chandogya Upanisad 5. 10. 3-7; Bhagavadglta 8.23-26. The names devayana and pitrydna are established in the Rg Veda. The concept of the way of the gods is well established ( see Grassmann, s. v. ) . The way of the Fathers, the ancestral spirits is mentioned once only ( 10. 2. 7 ) explicitly, whereas it is referred to as the other way different from that of the gods, the path of Death (qXrty; 10.18.1). Agni is invoked on the path of the Fathers ( 10. 2. 7 ), but the way of the gods is particularly that of Agni, the Sacrificial Fire, 10.51.2; 1. 72.7; 5.43. 6; 10.51.5; 10.99. 11. Agni, the Fire, burns on earth in the flame and it burns in heaven in the sun. Agni as sacrificial fire is the messenger between heaven and earth. Agni, the fire that burns in the sun, and Pusan, the glowing one, are continguous conceptions.</page><page sequence="4">KRAMBISCH: Pxsan 107 knows, for he himself traces, the way, when he, the most perfect of charioteers (6. 55. 2; 6. 56. 2-3) travels on both sides (vtst4) in his car (2 40. 3) . The one side of the journey is the path of Light and Day, the six months' journey of the Sun to the north, from the midnight point of the winter solstice, in the darkness. The other side of the journey begins from the point on high of the Sun in midheaven, and thence proceeds on its down- ward path. 2. PUSAN IN 1MIE PIT: The birth of Pusan, the glowing, is in the night (cf. 6. 58.1) of the year at the midnight hour, in the darkness. As soon as born, he journeys forth with his bundle of lmni- nous treasure (vaso rasir; 6. 55. 3) on the way of the gods, to his other beloved abode and "birth- place." Symbolically, his one birth is at the mid- night of the year, which is assigned to the South; and his other birth, at the high noon of the year, is assigned to the North. Between these two poles he leads his forward path upward and downward from birth to birth in perpetual, cyclical recur- rence. Upward is the path of the gods, the Devas, who travel with the light in which they have their . orlgin. Deva means " shining." :E[eaven ( div) is their station towards which they journey north- wards from the point of his midnight birth. Here Pusan is born as the Son of Liberation (vimuco nap{; 1. 42-1; 6. SS. 1). He is the Liberator (vimocana; 8. 4.15-16). He has removed the obstacles (1. 42.1 ) , on the downward path, on the evil way (cr. 10.135. 2) where he drives away the evil wolf (1.42.2), the rapacious, devouring ani- mal of darkness, he drives away the waylayer, the thief, and with his foot he tramples the burning hot weapon of the double-faced, evil minded fiend (1. 42. 4) . Pusan, the Liberator, is an irresistible (6.48 15),watchful (6.54.8) Lord (asura;5.51. 11), he removes the obstacle of greed which has its ilnage in the wolf, the obstacle of self-deception, the waylayer, and of distraction, the thief on the single-minded path.13 He removes the obstacles It is Pusan's goat that climbs up and goes ahead on the way of the gods (1.162.4). 18 RV. 10. 26. 5 invokes Pusan as Rsi, friendly to men and a protecting friend of the inspired singer-priest ( vtpra, " vibrant " ); Rsi, generally translated as sage or seer, conveys the fleetness, the immediacy of a pouring and shining forth alike to the light of the luminaries. Br. Up. 6.15. 2 invokes Puan as "sole Ri," the only Light. AV. 6.112. 3 Pusan delivers from Sin. and his glowing power extinguishes the dark heat of treachery and insincerity, when he puts down his foot on the double-faced fiend in the Pit " who- ever he may be " (1. 42. 4) . No allusion to the body of Pusan is made by this reference and no likeness of his should be con- jured up by those few body parts which the hymns employ in order to illustrate his nature. They are used as symbols to the same degree as are the animals, the wolf or his goat-steeds (ajasta; 1.138.4; 6.55.3; 6.58.2; 9.67.10) which draw his chariot. Aglow throughout, Pusan, in the ardour of his wrath, extinguishes the troubled heat of the two-faced enemy. His burning wrath is in the imprint of his foot, down in the abyss, on a fire now extinguished. H:is glow remains unper- turbed, free from heat, when he arises, born as Liberator, and then proceeds to the green pastures of illumination. ' Let there be no new heat [jvara (fever)] on the way to this pasture' (1.42.8) is the prayer at the end of this hymn (1. 42) to Pusan, the Son of Liberation. The fever and the burning belong to the hour of birth in the darkness in the pit, at the southern- most extremity of the Sun's course in the year. This cosmical topography is symbolical to the same degree as is the burning and cutting and lacera- tion of this hour. Here Pusan wields his weapons. He pricks and pierces the heart of the hoarder and miser, the Pani (6.53.5), with his awl. He at- tacks and tears open not only the heart of those who withhold their wealth of knowledge and hoard their wisdom (6. 53 T). H:e is the divine Tor- turer who probes the heart and opens it (6. 53. 8), tears and rends the heart of everyone. In this hour of the midnight Sun and its arising, in the Pit, Pusan, the Liberator, sharpens us like a razor (8.4.16), he grinds us, and makes us acute like the razor's edge so that our minds are freed from all obstacles, the dross that clogs the heart and intuition. With his weapon, the 2ra, he incites towards Brahman, the creative operation (6. 53. 8).14 He wields his golden adze (1. 42. 6) at the crossroads in the pit where he arises in his majesty as Liberator from the two-faced Evil, the pair of 14 Brahman is here rendered as creative operation (see note 8 ) as against J.

The wealth of Pusan, the Glowing One, is great and varied, rich in goods and rich in nourishment (2. 40. 40), in kine and horses (6. 53. 10). If some of it had been lost and some stolen, if an animal had fallen into the pit and broken a leg (6 54. T), they are retrieved by Pusan, whose herd is never lost (10.17.3). He is the herdsman of creation (10.17. 3), who beholds all (2. 40. S). Pusan, the " Good Shepherd," is the Liberator who glows in the midnight pit, where by his Light he found Soma, the hidden King (1. 23.14), and where he himself, in his own hidden aspect, was found by Agni the god Fire. 3. THEs HIDDEN GOD ( PIJSAN AND AGNI ): The midnight hour of realization is the birthplace of Pusan, the Liberator.

His dark heat is extinguished by the one foot 16 Of proceeding Pusan, the Liberator, swinging his golden adze, while ascending on his endless path. It is then and there, at the critical birth hour that Pusan, glowing in the darkness, hidden in the pit, is found by Agni, the Fire. " Seven red sisters the Knower has eagerly brought out of the 'Sweet' (madhu) for behold- ing. He, born in ages past, halted in mid-air. Seeking a hiding place, he found that of Pusan '&gt; (10.5.5). The seven red sisters are the flaming rays or streams of the light of creation whom from rta, cosmic order, is the place of the sorcerers. Their dubious remedies have their origin there. In a hymn of the Atharvaveda ( 6. 44. 3 ), medicinal poison, a plant (visdnaka) having sprung from "the Fathers' root," is invoked to eSect a cure. VVhether " in a likeness " or literally, the Fathers' root produced a shoot from the world of the dead, the cosmic outlaws, for the benefit of the sick. The line which separates the chasm of non- existence and the ordered cosmos is not sharply drawn. Eternal damnation-as a possibility-must underlie at its lowest point the path of Pusan, the Liberator. 16 In this aspect, before he goes further on his path, Pusan shines forth as Aja Eka pad, the Uncreate One- Foot. Aja Ekapad is an image of the vertical axis of Pus. an's cyclical path. Aja Ekapad connects Pusan's two poles of being. Aja means Uncreate but it a lso means goat. The goat is the animal symbol of Pusan. Aja Ekapad is the axis of the cosmos, pre- established as the upholder of its movement. Aja Ekapad is the central pole from the Birth on high to the Birth in the pit. opposites, right and left, the downward and the upward path. He annuls and unites them by his onward movement. In the dark and critical hour of his course Pusan as Liberator operates on both the emotional and on the intellectual levels of the depth of the pit. The topography of the pit is given by its contents. They are the perils of darkness, the dangers of the road in the brutality of their animal nature, in their aggressive aspects, and on the defensive they are the oppressive, tightening fear of the miser and hoarder which reinforces the evil and makes it two-faced, in its destructive obsessions of lie and deceit. Intellectually however, and fundamentally, the two-faced evil minded "who- ever he may be" (1.42.1), is an embodiment of dichotomy and of the pairs of opposites. He is the great obstruction on the forward path on the way of wholeness or integrity. The emotional, moral and intellectual stumbling blocks in the darkness of the pit, however, are not its only contents. Treasures are hidden, glowing in their own inner light.15 It is then and there that Pusan's wealth 15 Below the pit of danger and treasure lies the Lap of Nirrti ( 7. 104. 9 ), the lap of destruction with its end- less pit (7.104.17) below all creation (7.104.6). This deep dark place is the Asat, the Non-existent, "The Rg Vedic Equivalent for Hell," as shown by W. Norman Brown, JAOS, vol. 61, pp. 76-80. This deep substratum of the ordered cosmos, of the Existent (sat), the abyss that yawns at the bottom of the pit, in the lap of Destruction ( nirrti ) is the necessary opposite in the first pair of contraries. There they are from the be- ginning of things prior to which neither of them existed. The Asat, the Non-existent below the pit, is the re- mainder " apud principiuqn " of the all engulfing dark- ness, a¢te princi,pithrn. The Cosmic Darkness ante principiurn is distinguished from the darkness of the cc night of the cycle.' The hymns of the Rg Veda do not dwell to any length on the tedium of non-existence. Its hells become stag- gered in later layers of Indian thought. In the Rg Veda, it is those who are accursed because their actions had gone contrary to cosmic order (rta) who fall below all creation and never see the sun shine. They are outside Pusan's realm, they are neither fiends nor sinners but non-existent non-entities. And yet, this outcasting of hell provided a safety valve at the base for the protection of an ordered cosmos full of meaning. For the non-existent is the place where dwell the root-gods ( murad eva ) and/or their wor- shippers ( 7. 104. 14 ) . They are roots without trunk or " neck " (7. 104. 24), their stem is cut, they are dead. It is to such roots that the Fathers slip, the ancestral spirits (sB. 13. 8. 1. 20) .

Agni, born in the beginning of things enters with his fiery light all the worlds. He halts in mid- space. He seeks a hiding place, for he is overcome by the tremendous mystery of manifestation, by his breaking out of the Source into the light of day which he surveys. He finds the hiding place (vavri) of Pusan, where the Sun dwells in the dark (1.117. 5) .17 Agni, the Knower (vidvan) knows all beings. When he finds Pusan, he finds his own hiding place, and there he finds himself sharing in the activity of Pusan. He makes over to the gods those who have died (10.17. 3). This is his task, on the way of the gods, the upward path, the way of redemp- tion, for he is cognisant of the other way, where Pusan makes over the dead to the Fathers (10. 2.7). Agni, the Fire, transmits in his burning flame the bodies of the dead, divests them of their mor- tality and helps to lead them back toward celestial light, where Yama dwells, the first of mortals who found the way to the highest heaven (10.14.2) where he drinks with the gods under the well- leafed tree (10. 135. 1) . In relation to Pusan, the Glowing, core of the Sun's light, who is steadfast ( 10. 26. 8 ), from whom nothing is hidden (10. 64. 3), though hidden in the cover of darkness (vavr; 10. S. 5 ), Agni, the Fire, is the essence o f that core as it is beyond even and in Heaven which is Pusan's other birthplace. One with Pusan, ante principium, Agni, it is told, returns to their Source in his "flight" from this earth when he had become tired of his work of minister- ing, as sacrificial flame, to the sacrificial needs of men. When he bursts forth into manifestation and brings out of their source the seven fiery mares of light, he pauses in mid-air, seeks cover, and 17 The myth tells of the flight of Agni, the sacrificial Fire, and how he absconded from his office, the sacrifice. Having taken flight, he was found by Yama, the first mortal (10. 51) and himself an aspect of Agni (1. 66. 8; 1. 164. 46).

There, in the hiding place of Pusan, he finds himself-for Agni is Pusan (2.1 6).18 In the identity of their natures and con- joint in their operations, Pusan leads the way and Agni brings back to the gods those whom, while on earth, he helped to leave their dead bodies. The division of functions of these great gods is as intangible as it is transparent. They nlanifest in light and flame. It is a division in degrees, of one proceeding power. Each progression, each in- tensity of the proceeding power from Savitr to Pusan to Surya or in its diversification as Agni and Pusan, has its own name and place in the perpetual creation around which Pusan leads the way. The hiding place of Pusan is in the pit, at the parting of the ways, where the pillar of Life (dyu) stands, on its foundations (10.5.6). The pillar of Life is a figure of that same axis which Pusan sets up when he puts his foot on the Two-faced Evil One whose firebrand is extinguished on the "path of paths" where the downward journey of Pusan who there has led the Fathers (10.17.3) from this earth, on the pitryana, the way of the Fathers, swings over into the ascent of the gods, on the devayana. The origin of Agni's and Pusan's natures is in the heights, where Savitr is (1. 35. 6) and the dwelling of Yama. Their union is in the depth, where Pusan arises in his majesty and where he leads from the dark night, on the way to the gods, to the peak of manifestation. Agni is Fire and Pusan Illumination. Glowing in inner Light, Pusan, the Psychopompos, on his downward path, "whose herd is never lost" (10.17.3), becomes the Liberator in the Pit where he finds the Trea- sure and one flaming Pillar of Light and Life (ayu) extends from the Depth to the Height. 4.

Pusan, the 18 Agni is Pusan, whereas Savitr becomes Pusan p. 105)- 19 Barhis is the sacrificial grass which is spread on the place of sacrifice, the Vedi.

Eertel, Die arische Fseverlehre, p. 15).</page><page sequence="7">110 EZRAMRISCH: Pusan herdsman of creation (10 17.3) found him, the King, on his shining sacrificial grass, as he finds a lost animal ( 1. 23. 13 ) .20 EZing Soma, the Elisir of Life, the drink of immortality (1. 91. 18), is the " first milk of IIeaven " ( 9. 110. 8 ) in his celestial home of flow- ing light, above the firmament, in the highest heavens of light (9. 86.15).21 In his celestial home he is placed in the lap of the stars (naksatra; 10. 85. 2).22 The flowing Light of the spheres (rocana) of IIeaven, or also the stars are the carpet of Soma, the King, in the IIeight and in the Depth.23 There, in the night of the year, glowing Pusan found the hidden :King, on his shining car- pet as he finds a lost animal or hidden treasure (8. 29v6). Pusan hows the hidden treasures, finds all hidden, shining wealth (6.48.15), has all the treasures, is a stream of riches (6.55.3), an abundance of wealth. In him all wealth is founded (rayo budhnah; 10. 139. 3), all riches collected. IIe brings the hidden goods to light (6,48.15), comes as shining Wealh itself (8.31. 11) and gives wealth of all kinds and substance (9.88.3; 6.53v2; 6.56.6) to man. Those who seek riches address him (6.55.2): "Help us by our inner vision (dhz) to procure shining riches, O Liberator " (8. 4. 15 ) . The wealth of Pusan, which he, the master of all possessions (1.89. 6) owns in abundance (8.4. 15), he gives to him first who sees and invokes him (6.54.4). Glowing Pusan is the incandes- cence of Light that is in the Sun- He is and gives its very substance. He is the Sun that never sets for all the time he proceeds on his way, from light to darkness and back to light. In the darkness, in the pit, lle glows and by his light he finds the treasure that is hidden in the night, treasure of all kinds that has been lost and awaits being furthered 2° Soma ( 1. 23. 13 ) is evoked as " the support of heaven, that is, as coincident with the pillar of life and with Puean, the liberator and Aja Ekapad. For Soma as the support of heaven, see 6. 47. 4-5; 9. 74. 2; 9. 76. 1; 9. 86. 35; 9. 86. 46, and for Soma, the Eing, 1. 23. 14; 1. 91. 43. 216.44.23; 9.86.15; 9.110.8. 22 The nak$atras are the stations of the moon in other Vedic texts. 28 In later Vedic texts, as also in the marriage hpn (10.85.2), Soma is evoked as Moon. The light of this luminary, however, is in its origin, the one Light of the heavenly luminous spheres, above the firmament. into light. He finds all these riches by finding the EZing. The substance of Pusan, the Liberator, is I1- lumination. It is this wealth which he procures for the sacrificer, the singer and the sage, vibrant (vipra) with the movement of IIis Light.24 In the darkness of the night, where he extinguishes the futile firebrand of the two-faced enemy, he finds the Treasure. It is Wing Soma, the elisir of life. Born in the depth of midnight, Pusan is found by Agni, and Soma is found by Pusan. Agni, the sacrificial Fire, the Spark of Life, and Soma the sacrificial " Of3Sering," the Elisir of Life, are essence and substance of the flowing light of heaven, whose path Savitr, the Impeller, traverses on the " great drive " (mahat ajma, 4. 53. 4), when, by his movements he becomes Pusan, the Glowing One (5. 81. S). Pusan, born in the pit, is the Liberator and Illuminer, the guide who leads to Light. IIe is creative Fire kindled, when, having been found by Agni, they are one (2v 1. 6). Agni-Pusan, the creative Fire, finds Soma, the "of3Sering" the luminous, formative principle, the Treasure. In his awesome majesty, Pusan, the glowing one, the Liberator, gives this Treasure to the inspired sage, the Vipra, vibrant in the repercussions of the revelation. IIe does not give it to the unpre- pared. IIe tests whom he chooses, probes his heart, and sharpens his mind. With his pointed weapon he tears and rends the heart, opens it and stimu- lates the spirit so that it arises in an upsurge of creative fervour (brahman; 6. 53. 8). IIe quickens inner vision (dh; 1. 89. S; 2. 40. 6; 6. 58. 2; 6. 49. 8 ), promotes sacred thought and inspires the Vipras, the vibrant seers (10- 26. 4). When Soma's inspiration is invoked, he is appealed to " like intuition inspiring Pusan art thou, O Soma" (9. 88. 3).25 The Treasure shines forth in 24 Images of kine, horses, wealth, riches and substance ( vasu, rai) are symbolical synonyms ( cf. pecunia-pecus ) of the treasure which Pusan finds and disperses. His " substance " is illumination. He gives to each one according to his light. Should it be dim, showing only the tangible shape of things, the treasures are taken for factual possessions of cattle and the like. 2S (; Piiseva dhijavano 'si soma."

It is then that Pusan i8 born and invoked by the Rsi " O Son of Libera- tion, glowing one, let us two unite " ( 6. SS . 1 ) . 5. PUSAN ASCENDING: Pusan, having found the Hidden Wing, drives him hither (1. 23.14) in their chariot (2.40.3) and while they ascend on the way of the gods, the Vipra prays: " And may he with the Soma-drops, driving forward for me the sis-yoked together, plough as it were a grain- field with osen" (1.23.15). In the chariot are Pusan and Soma, the Treasure found, the elisir of life, sparkling with its drops, ready for work, arising to fertilize the field of the Vipra. The chariot is drawn by the " six yoked together," by the pairs of draught-animals which are the months of the year when viewed as positions of the Sun. Each position of the Sun occurs twice in the year, in the ascending and in the descending half.26 Upward in course of the new year which follows his birth in the pit, the chariot carriers Pusan with the Soma drops. IIe sprinkles them on the yield- ing ground. Pusarl sows, as it were, the seed of Soma orl the field while his draught-animals, which are the months, are ploughing like osen. Pusan ascending in his sun-chariot directs his energy downwards, he makes fruitful the field of which he is, as it were, the ploughman. The herds- man of creation is the ploughman of the field of the mind which he illumines and inseminates with the scintillating drops of Soma, the Treasure and Elisir of Life. In the elation of the arising of these two creator- gods, the Rsi chants: " O Soma and Pusanw crea- tors of Treasure, creators of Heaven, and creators of Earth, you two born herdsmen of the whole world, the gods made you the navel of the im- mortal " ( 2. 40. 1 ) . " The gods rejoiced in the birth of these two divinities. May these two spread over the joyless dark. With them, with Soma and Pusan, Indra generated ripeness in the raw [dawn of days] " (2). " O Soma and Pusan, mighty Bulls, urge on the chariot that measures the space [between thinking in the sense of inner vision, intuition and wisdom. All these are carried by " devotion " in the sense of " An-dacht " which is an intellectual rather than an emotional mode. 28 The six yoked together have been taken by Sayana to refer to the six seasons of the year, each of two months' duration ( cf. M. Bh. 1. 3. 141-143 ) . lll heaven and earth], that has seven wheels, that does not carry everyone, that rolls to both sides, that is yoked by the Mind, that has five reins.nn (3) " The one [Pusan] has made his dwelling in heaven on high, the other [Soma] on earth, up in midspace. May both open up and unfold the wealth full of treasures, rich in substance, the in- nermost centre within us. (4) "The one [Soma] has generated all creatures, the other [Pusan] travels, beholding all. O Soma and Pusan, further my inner vision. With you two may we win all battles.' (5) 27 Soma and Pusan as cosmogonic powers have arisen from the depth, on the cycle of Pusanns path, in the spring of Life, with which they cover the joyless dark. Now the glowing one is a bringer of j oy ( 1.13 8.1 -2 ) and nourishment ( 4. 3. 7 ) . IIe works wonders (dasra; 1. 42. S; 6. 56. 4). To- gether with Soma, he joins powers with Indra, the creator of manifestation and performs the miracle of generating "cooked" (pakra) milk in the raw cOWS 28 The miracle of putting the " cooked " white milk in the raw cows is the miracle of endowirlg the creature with creative power. The "ras" ones, the cows, are symbols of the dawn where the red cows of the coming day emerge from the black cows of night. This dawn is the dawn of creation, in the beginning, when light was dis- covered by Indra (2. 17. 4; 3. 39. S) and he filled 27 In this hymn (2. 40) Soma and Pusan are invoked as cosmogonic powers whose conjoint share in creation is specified. They are the "navel of the immortal." The navel is the centre whence generation proceeds into manifestation. This is illustrated in later Indian ico- nography by the god Brahma seated on a lotus flower whose stalk issues from the navel of Vis.nu lying on the waters. In the second stanza "birth " means coming into being which is here the light of consciousness arising from cosmic darkness, the darkness ante principium. The epithet "bull " in the third stanza means creative power. 28 This miracle of Indra is frequently evoked in simi- lar terms, as in 8. 89. 7 and in 1. 62. 9. " In the raw ones you put the cooked milk, the white in the black, in the red ones " (also 2. 40. 2; 3. 30. 14; 6. 17. 6; 8.32.5). The white, luminous milk is contrasted with the black and red cows; cf. the later theory of the 3 gunas, the white sattva-guna, the black tamo-guna, the qualitative potentials of existence, the one, luminous and pure, the other dull and dark, while the middle term of the aggregate is turbulent, red.

Into these cows of heaven, the Dawn of manifestation, which are young and raw, Indra, the Creator of this universe, puts the "milk " which is cooked and ripe in their young raw bodies of a chilly morning at the dawn of the world. Such is the triulle miracle of Indra, Pusan alld Soma. For this cookecl "milk" is a great light (3. 30.14) 29 alike to that of Soma him- self, the "first milk of heaven" (9.51.2). It is the glory (yasas) in the cows (4.1.16; 10.106 11), the glory in the creature, it is its creative power like that of the Madhu, the " Sweet " Soma (10.49.10). The creativeness in the creature is the white milk that flows in the verses of the hymn (mantra ; 10.106.11 ) .30 The shining glory of creativeness radiates from the " creature " when it has ripened in wisdom. The nziracle of the creative power of inspiration and sacred knowl- edge is a Fire miracle by which the raw data of existence are "cookedn' and ripened. The cooked milk is of the nature of Sorna, the milk of heaven. Soma is and generates the drink of Life, of which the cooked milk is a symbol. The cause is in the effect. They are expressed in one symbol. Those who generate and create have entered into and are the things which they have generated and createdF Soma is the drink of life, its elixir, its " wine." Pusan, the Nourisher, sprinkles the Soma drops and tills the soil wherein he makes and becomes the food of life, its " bread." Soma and Pusan as cosmogonic powers contribute to the miracle performed by Indra the miero- cosmic image of the miracle of the hymn which is ripe and sweet in the secret act of its becoming, in the innermost centre of the singer (2. 40. 4). While it is carried there, rich in substance, it is the wealth full of treasures. Soma and Pusan will open up this secret hoard aIld its contents will roll out, a mighty chariot, "which measures the spaee between Eeaxren alld Earth " ( 2. 40. 3 ) .31 29 3. 30.14 sings of " a great light (mahi jyotir) hidden in the udders tof the cows]. The raw (cow) moves on carrying the cooked [milk]." 30 10. 106. 11 calls the hymn (mantra) the cookecl sweet ( madhu ) which is the glory in the COW8. This "white, desired tmilk] in the udders and bellies of the cows is sweeter than sweet" (10.49.10). 31 The hymn as a chariot is a recurrent image (2. 31. 4; 10. 26. 9). The driving power of inspiration is spoken of by the Rsis as their chariot. The whole eosmos is " eomprehended " by it. The sacrifice with its rites is a symbol of the cosmos as " universal sacrifice " 6. TIIE CHARIOT OF PUSAN AND SOMA AND PUSANnS GOAT: In this chariot Pusan dri-es forward the "sis yoked together" (1.23.15), the syzygies of the Sun's stations in the year, the course of the year, time in its cyclical unit. This chariot has seven wheels. Like the seven red sister3 whom Agni brings out of the " Sweet " for beholding, the number seven here too indicates a coming forth into manifestation from the transcendental source as a totality in which all the degress of manifesta- tion are linked with their source.32 This total cosmos, the "Sat," includes this world and the two higher light worlds which are not visible to the physical eye*33 They all are drawn by the " sis yoked together," at any moment, throughout all time. The seven wheels are a symbol of the total illtelligible cosmos, of which this visible world here is but a part. This total cosmic structure is present at any moment of the ehariot's course throughout time. It is the locus of the "htc e-t nunc," the " here and now " of the total, im- mediate intuition beholding the intelligible Ulli- verse, this world and the Light worlds beyonfl, together with their common source. It is a vision and has the same signifieant numbers as the chariot (Bergaigne II, p. 430). 32 The several heptads of the R. g Veda refer to the Souree. The seven Rsis are, or aet as, the " seven rays " of the Sun. Rsi or radiating is generally translated as " seer " but would mean " rushing " or outpouring from rs or ars; this meaning is taken a8 referring to the singer who pours out his songs. The seven Rsis, hour- ever, are eelestials, and the meaning of " raying forth light," the word raying being taken as transitive7 appears even more suitable than the intransitive mean- ing. This w-ould make the Rsis themselves rays of light pouring forth or rushing out into manifestation from their souree on high. Cf. note 13. Another fundamental signifieanee of the number seven is given by the three pairs of heaven-and-earth. They make the triple universe with its three heavens and three earths into whieh the one undivided Prineiple beeame diSerentiated while holding or " earrying " all. Images of the " One earrying the six " are given in 3. 56. 2; and of the " One in the sllape of 'Aja ' who has separated these six worlds " in 1. 164. 6, also 1. 164. 10. Aja cf. Aja Ekpad (note 16) with refelence to Pusan. 33 The word translated here as nTorlds is rajnsi ( 1. 164. 6 ), the world spaces. Rajas connote.s the space that came into being by the separation of the-ante princtptum-undivided heaven-and-eartll. Rajas thus denotes not only the " atmosphere " between this earth and the sky, but is used also to signify the spaces ( rocana ) of eternal light in the two higher, invisible worlds, when spoken of as three rajansi. Rajas7 in tlle singular, however, here denotes the atmosphere.</page><page sequence="10">KRAMRISCH: PZusan 113 which carries Pusan and Soma in their timeless natures. This chariot does not carry everyone,34 it is the vehicle of intuition, the vehicle of poesy.35 The reins or rays of the chariot are five in num- ber.36 Five in the Rg Veda is particularly the number of the Five Kins (pancajanah). The five kins occupy the levels from the earth to the sun (10. SS. 2) and represent Mind in its various levels of attachment and activity.37 Mind in its con- tingent aspects are the reins by which Pusan, the "most excellent of charioteers," (6.

Pusan and Soma ride in their chariot. Pusan is higher in station (2.40.4) 38 and wisdom (2. 40.5). In the pit, Pusan had found Soma, the Hidden Wing. He was hidden, not lost, in the darkest hour of the aeviternal round. Now Pusan, the Glowing, 34 2. 40. 3. The word avissaminvam has generally, though not unanimously, been translated as " not carry- ing everyone" [Ludwig, Der Rig Veda 5, p. 302; Geld- ner, Der Rig Veda I, p. 296]. This meaning agrees +^rith 1.164.10 which is the only other occurrence of this word in the RV. S. D. Atkins, in Pusan in the Rig Veda, p. 45, trans- lates aviSvaminvam as though it were equivalent to vissaminvam; "who pervades all." ViSvaminva7 is, by intended contrast, the attribute of Pusan in 2. 40. 6. 35 The chariot, in this respect is also the hymn. (Note 31). The seven wheels, the five reins, allude as little to the appearance of an actual chariot as the foot of Pusan-or the three heads of other gods are meant to suggest human shape. Nothing here is descriptive or anthropomorphic. The vocabulary of experience is used in combinations +arhich defy experience and conjure up an immediate and coherent vision. Tlley clo it +^rith a shock, not altogether unintentionally. 36 Rasmi signifies rein or also ray. 27The names of the Five Kins are given (with some variations) in the Aitareya Brahmana (3. 31. 5) and Brhad Devata (7. 67-71 ) . They are the Serpents (naya), Fathers, or ancestral spirits, men, gods and Gandharvas, in ascending hierarchy. 38 Soma in this context is evoked not as the celestial Soma, but as his correspondence on earth, the Soma plant which grows on the high mountain, in midspace (9.79.4; 9.110.8; 9.82.3). 39 A prayer says: " AIay Soma restore the body (tanu), Pusan the way which saves." (10.59.7). moves on with his companion, steadfast (10.26.8) and watchful (6.54-8). He sprinkles sparkling drops of the treasure over the fields and pastures of man (10.26.3) and moistens the paths (8.29. 6) 40 to earth. As they travel heavenwards the mighty friend of nurture (10.26.7) beholds all. He is the bringer of good fortune (1.42.6), the augmenter of goods (10.26.9), the friend (6. SS. 2,5; 10 26.8) of the sacrificers, the desired (10. 26.7),belovedofallthegods (10.92.13). Heis an all-bounteous (8.31.11) master of all posses- sions (1.89.6) who brings plentiful nourishment (6.48.14), for he is the Lord of nurture (6.58.4), Pusan, the Nourisher. He brings himself and he brings Soma. The Bread and Wine of Life are in his chariot, as Pusan and Soma travel to the peak of the world. There, in the celestial heights, Pusan will lead the Bride from the Father's house, to- wards Soma. The blessiilgs on earth which Pusan brings are but a reflex of the joy which he brings to the wise and vibrant, the sacrificers, seers and singers (1. 138, 1, 2; 6. SS. 3) when they behold Pusan, the G#lowing, their friend and illumination. Pusan's animal symbol is the goat (aja). The word is derived from aj, and denotes agility. Pusan is called ajtra or fleet (1.138.2) like a racer in his course. His course is that of the sun in its yearly cycle (ct. 6.58.1). The goat is in its ele- ment when, surefooted and swift, it climbs up the way of the gods, in the cycle of the year. It em- bodies the movement of Pusan on his path and represents that movement when goats draw Pusan's (hariot. They are his goatsteeds (jasra; 1-138.4; 6.55.3,4; 6.58.2; 9.67.10), his own fleetness in the shape of the goat.4l It is in this function that the sacrificial goat, in the rite of the Horse-sacrifice (1.162.2-4) conducts the sacri- ficial horse, the symbol of the year or the sun in its annual cycle on its prefiguring circuit around the place of sacrifice, on the "way of the gods." 40 Soma is god and elixir of life just as "Dionysus, himself a god, is poured out in offering to the gods, so that through him mankind receives blessing." Euripi- des, The Bacchae (trans. L. P. Vellacott, p. 190). 41 Equally surefooted, the goat climbs down the moun- tain slope from the height of the cycle of the year on the path of the Fathers. If this cyclical movement is viewed in one direction-which is the direction of timc the graphic sign is the chevron pattern of zig-zag outline, which owes its name to the goat (chevre).</page><page sequence="11">114 KRAMRISCX: Pusan At the height, at the peak of manifestation, at the apes of the sun's annual cycle, at the noon hour of the year, Pusan glows like bright gold. IIis station is now at the other end of the axis, above the point where he extinguishes the fire- brand in the pit and was " born '&gt; as son of Liberation (vtmuco napat; 6. 55. 1). Glowing in wrath and majesty in the dark night of the cycle now, at the high noon, he is aglow with Love (kamena krta, made by love, 6.49.8; 6.58.3-4). Pusan in his glory makes his golden ships travel in the celestial ocean [of liquid light] and in mid- space (6.58.3) and he shakes his golden beard from side to side (10. 26. 7) .43 iELaying forth from his station above, his power, he is the Lord of great munificense (6. 55. 2), greater still than on his ascent when he sprinkled in sparkling drops, the treasure o-f liing Soma, on the fields and pastures of men. With his golden ships 44 Pusan, activated by love and desiring praise goes on embassy for Surya, the Sun god (6. 58. 3). To whom does his embassy take Pusan in his glory, at the hey-day of the world? It is the time of the wedding of Surya. She is the daughter of Surya, the Sun god (1.116. 17) but it is Savitr, the Impeller who acts as her father (10. 85. 9, 13).45 lIe gives her in marriage to Soma. She is radiance to this world and the flowing light oceans above the firmament reflect her shining presence. Surya, the Sun maiden, is the daughter of the Impeller and of the impelled. She is fulfillment itself-as s daughter '-of the moving cause as well as of its effect. From the house of the Father, she goes to her wedding in her chariot, " Mind and 4SHair is a symbol of vital powerX and of the inner light. The golden hair of the god is solar power, raying downwards, as his " beard," throughout the cosmos. Cf. the divine power in the hair of Samson (Judges 13.3- 16. 30) . In later Indian art and thought, Ganga, the celestial river the water of heaven, comes to earth in Biva's hair; cf. also the story of Apala (above) and the story of the Visnupurana of the white and black hair which Visnu pulled from his head and in which Lord Krsna and elder brother Balarama were incarnated. 44 The gods readily, and for soteriological reasons, change their chariots for ships in their journeys in the ocean of flowing light and the vapours of the air. 46 Savitr is the great Father (7. 52. 3) . The daughter of the Sun (Surya) (1. 34. 5) is Surya. Surya is Savitrl. AV. 6. 82. 2; 14. 2. 3. The Savitrl mantra follows im- mediately the evocation of Pusan ( 3. 62. 7-9 ) and the image of the Bride. It precedes the horse in this rite and will itself be sacrificed first, preceding the horse symbol of the sun on its way to heaven. The goat represents the power of solar movement which symbolically pre- cedes the sun in the same way as ontologically Pusan (' precedes " Surya, in the hierarchy of manifestation. In the ascension of the sun-horse to heaven, Pusan's goat goes straight ahead to heaven, their station. The goat is Visvarupa ( 1. 162. 2 ) .42 Pusan and his path, his goat and chariot belong together by logical afEnity expressing the move- ment of the glowing god which the sun's disc shields from view. He is the glowing core of inner light in motion. The chariot is the realm of the god's power. Pusan's chariot, as the seven wheels show, drives right out of the source into the light- space above and the worlds below the sun. The course of the chariot is controlled by the mind which tightens the reins according to the five-fold needs of those who live under the sun. The light spaces above the firmament, the iELocana are in- visible to the eye of man They are part of the Sat, they exist in the mind and correspond to degrees of illumination prior to, or in spatial sym- bolism, above their sensible expression. The light realms above the firmament, above the world of form, are effective cosmogonically. Flowing with supra-sensible luminosity, they forecast this world der the sun. They are equally eSective in the ontology of intuition or inspired thought ( dhz, manas) before it is laid down in word and image. The chariot carries the power of creative, in- spired thought (dhz, rnana,s) and the knowledge of the supra-mundane, luminous source of that power. Glowing Pusan, the best of charioteers, drives his chariot to the summit and thence he will ( drive down the sun's golden wheel " (6.56.3). 7.

The radiant song of praise (arka) aseends. Pusan 'stake[s] pleasure in this laud- as the bridegroom takes pleasure in his bride " (3. 62. 8). Activated by love, Pusan carries out for Surya his ambassadorial task, acting as the guardian of the pathway of illumination, the straight road from singer to GEod. Pusan, the Glowing, is nearer to their common souree than Surya, the Sun. lIe brings about the direct con- nection between this souree beyond and in the heart (manas; hTd) of the Rsi. He goes on this embassy at the special oceasion of the nuptials of Surya, the daughter of Surya. His embassy travels the straight and swift path from the Souree above to the Vipra, from Heaven to Earth.47 His golden ships run a straight course.48 "Pusan is a good friend of Heaven and Earth, Lord of nurture, bounteous, wondrous in his glory, whom, activated by love, strong and swift, the gods gave to Surya " 46 The chariot of Surya is Manas itself (cf. the chariot of Puean pp. 111-113). Manas, in 10. 84.1-12 and in 10. 60. 8-10 corresponds to voNs, the mind-soul which leaves the body at death. 7 This path leads in a straight line, and coincides with the vertical axis which Pusan establishes when he puts his foot down in the pit. Its starting point here is in the heights. The heart of the Rsi lies on this line. The straight swift path, the central vertical axis viewed from above or below, has its image in the One who bears the sixfold burden in the name of Aja Ekapad. 8 The ship is the ship of sacred thought ( nava matlnam 1. 46. 7 ) which here starts from ' the other shore.' If the ship takes the return journey from man to God it is the sacrifice which fulfills this function: Yajniyam navam (10.44.6). In 1.140.12 ship, chariot ( and house ) are coordinated in their function of carrying man ' to the other shore." The ship of the ritual (rta) is at the same time the ship of rta, the order in the cosmos. This ship takes ;' the straightest course." ( 9. 89. 2 ) . The house is also synonymous with the body. (6.58.4). As what do the gods give Pusan to Surya on her wedding day with Soma.?-The wheels of her chariot ' Mind " hear his lauds. (ct. 10. 85. 8-11). While Surya dispatches his embassy and Pusan makes the golden fleet of illumination sail straight- away to their destination, Father Savitr, the Im- peller, has taken leave of the Sun maiden and her bridal procession ( 10. 85. 13 ) * Surya has mounted her chariot. She has left the impulsion of Savitr. As Bride, she proceeds in her own chariot of spirit- mind and soul (manas) at the hey-day of the cosmos. Surya, as daughter, is the fulfilment of Savitr, the ' father." By his movements (yamabhth ) Savitr becomes Pusan.49 Pusan is Savitr by kinetic extension and condensation of the impel- ling luminous power of Light. In the hierarchy of manifestation of celestial Light through the Sun's orb, Savitr, the Impeller of Light, ontologically precedes Pusan, the Glow- ing Light, in movement. Savitr impels by his movements the insubstantial, transeendental es- sence, Light in itself, to become glowing, heated by its movement into the golden splendour of the sun. In this moment and form of manifestation, the glowing substance, impelled by Savitr is Pusan. The ontological hierarchy of celestials is expressed here in terms of ' becoming." It is also conveyed by the analogy of filiation, in the relation of father and son or father and daughter. Surya is the daughter of Surya. She is the active power of Savitr, at the height of manifestation. Twice- over related to Pusan, she is his sister. Pusan is activated by love, he is all love (karnena krta, made by love) when he goes on the Sun god's embassy (6.58.3), and brings about the sudden flash of intuition which hits straight like a ray of the Sun. He is activated by love when he gets the radiant song (arka). 'vArka" is anything that radiates. It is ray, splendour and lightning.

He is, more- over, the son of the two Asvins, whom he had chosen as fathers 50 when these heavenly twins, the Lords of Beauty, had come as her wooers (prcha- manau) to Surya's wedding ( 10. 8a. 14-15 ) . In the marriage ritual of the humail bride Pusan is invoked to lead the bride by her hand from the house of her parents (10. 85. 26).51 l'usan is to bring to the husband the bride "in whom men sow their seed" (10.85.37). Pusan is her guide on this path. Surya is the archetypal Bride, the Bride ill lleaven in the chariot of the Spirit (rnanas). She is the Light in the Spirit, the Light of Heaven. " She spread to the gods her immortal and ageless glory " (sravas; 3. 53. 15 ) . As a bridegroom takes pleasure in his bride so does Pusan, aglow with love, rejoice in the glory and radiance of the Song (arka) which comes to him like a bride. It was the target of his love embassy. Surya, the arche- typal Bride is also the archetypal Song in the " chariot ' of ASind-soul. As Bride she is the inner readiness and radiance of the light in the Spirit7 at the high noon of creation. This is how Pusan loves the Bride and leads her towards her husband. The time when Surya having taken leave of Father Savitr sets out from his house in the mar- riage procession, is marked by the stars (nak.satea) Agha and Arjul1l ( 10. 85. 13 ) . These stars are also known bAr their llanles WIagha and ETttara Phalgunl.55 They are lullar mansions and are Wsituated at the peak of manifestatioll? the 0tTigh Noon of the year. The wooers are the Vsvins, the heavenly twins, the transcendental kllights of movement in the cosmos. Surya now mounts their three-wheeled chariot and Pusan, as son, chooses them as parents. The Bride, having left the Father's house, was driven forward in her own spirit-mind-soul chariot. 8° Pitarau means fathers but it also designates the Asvins as parents in the same way as tlle dual janitrt ( mothers ) designates Heaven and Earth as parents (10.110.9; 1.185.6). 41 Kausika-sutra, 76. 10. 52 A. V. 19. 7. 2-3; Ap. Gr S. 1. 3. 1-2. Although the ?{aksatras are not given in the R. g Veda in their full number of 27 or 28, they are enumerated in later Vedic texts. Waksatra, however, in the RV. connotes a lunar mansion like those of Agha and Arjunl. Arjunl (Uttara Phalgunl ) is a Waksatra favourable for marriages (Paraskara Grhya Sutra, 1. 4. 6; Apastamba, 1. 3. 2. f.) . She now ascends the three-wheeled chariot of the three-fold creation and is raised to the throne which the Asvins offer to her as Great Goddess (cf. 10. 85. 15) and Mistress of the Universe. At this supreme moment in Surya's procession to Soma, her husband, Pusan chooses the Asvins as his parents, in a flash of awareness of their all-encompassing sway and circuit. The Asvins aeviternally drive their chariot prior to any sun that ever has arisen. They prefigure movement I)rior to its first vibration in the earliest dawn.53 In the wake and within the orbit of their move- uent Pusan knows his way. II e chooses, for he comes to know them as his parents at the high noon of the year, when he is born at the peak of manifestation on the foremost path of paths, in the heights of heaven (cf. 10.17.6). This is his other birth in the foremost path of paths ill Heaven, a birth by choice, the entry through the dual nature of the Twills, as their son, into the ceaseless round of the :Path, the elltry into mani- festation at its peak, on its high t)ole right opposite to his birthplace in the Deep, as son of Libelsation. Down there, the two-faced evil one "whoever he may be" lies troddell (lowll. E3[ere, at the upper pole of the asis of his CilCUit, Pusan is born of the ,tSVillS in their dual nature. He enters his course by the nature of duality, ba the archetypal an(l inseparable pair of contraries which keeps the world in perpetual tensioll. Pusan, having lovingly conducted Surya in her procession from the Father's house, takes leave of her as sister. His love now belongs to her as the GFreat GLoddess, in a transport of cosmic movement in which she is carried by the chariot of the A§vins ( 10. 8a. 26 ) . She had chosen this chariot for the beauty of the -Nsvins and the beaut) of the chariot, which equals theirs, and she enjoyed its beauts (1. 117. 13; 1.118. S; 1. 119. S; 4. 43. 2). This heauty is that of creative movement in its harmonar. Pusan is now the suitor of Surya, the Great Goddess enthroned. -\s the GFreat Goddess she is the GFreat Mother. She is Pllsan's mother in the same way as the husband in his wife becomes her son ( cf- 10. 8.&gt;). 4.) ) . Proceeding from the Source, rio Pusan's sonship of the Cosmic Trins, one of +hom is mortal, the other immortal ( 1. 181. 4) corresponds to his own cosmogonic station between Savitr and this '; mortal " sun. The Asvins also fathered Agni (10. 24. 4-5; cf. 10. 184. 3) . They churned Agni into being, acting themselves as the fire drill.</page><page sequence="14">KRAMRISCX: Piisan 117 from Savitr, the IInpeller, Surya, the sun maiden, becomes the Great Goddess. Pusan, who has the same origin, glows with the essence and substance of Light. He glows with love which is the nature of light in creation. His love goes to Surya, his sister, nearest to him in cosmogonic procession and who, as the manifesting power of Light, be- comes the Great Goddess of the manifest cosmos. Pusan, the inner glow of light in movemeilt, leads her celestial incadescence to full glory for to her he is seed and kernel, the innelsmost core within the Sun. In this way too, Pusan leads the Bride towards her son.54 Then Pusan proceeds on his path, laying his right hand around his deseending way, ln the cycle of the year. At the heights, ill Heaven, Pusan is the Lord (asura) in his love. Pusan is the lover of his sister and mother, who are one, and son of the same, the Great Goddess, at the moment of her glory when she is enthroned by the ASVillS, the archangels of cosmic movement, his fathers. Lover and son, mother and father represent the integral and intimate, proceeding relation to and from the source, onward tnto manifestation, and referring beyond time and manifestation. The relation is that of a web of a perennial state and perennial process in which the identity of a god on his path emerges. In this web of congenital images there is neither contradiction nor incest. A visual logic of prefigured form traces the pattern of life in the cosmos and for man. 8. PUSAN LEADS T'XE BRIDE: Similar to his role in leading the human bride (10. 85. 26) it is Pusan who gives the direction to the furrow in the field but it is Indra who gives eflect to it and press?es down the furrow (4. aT. t).55 Pusan is and 34 Pusan's role has frequently been misunderstood. He is not the lDridegroom of SurTa, nor are the Asvins the bl idegl ooms of Surya ( and Pusan does not lead the Asvins to tlle marriage of Surya? as Pischel, Vedische Studicx I, p. 114, ancl Atkins, p. 10, interpret 1. 184. 3) . Tlle variolls attempts by Oldenberg and other scholars clarify some passages, but fail to see the meaning of the " marriage of Surya " and of the roles of the mem- bers of the bridal partfT.

He leads the Bride the way of love and he leads the singer's tnind the way of intuition where he beholds the Bride in the chariot of Spirit and Mind-soul. At the heights Pusan is the "Lord of her, the longing and thinking, the shining one and of him, the shining one " ( 10. 26. 6 ) .56 The " longing, thinking" one is the hymn as the expression of intuitive thought ( dh) and its direction. She, too, Dhl, is the Shining One in the coincidence with the aim of her direction, the Light on High, the shining GLoddess, Surya, the Bride. He, the Shining One, is Soma, to whom Pusan leads the ., rlcle. On the straight and swift road Pusan guides and incites the inner vision as forcibly as he knows how to probe, rend and open the heart. With his goad he instigates the spirit to create and give form (brahrnan; 6. 53. 8), for in himself as Pusan is that swelling might (vatapya; 10. 26. 2), the leaveIl, by which he stimulates (9. 88. 3) and quickens (2. 40. 6) this sacred wisdom (dh). In this, his power, he is equal to Soma. " Like Soma, l'usan knows the hymning lauds" (10.26.3). 9. TXE EATER OF GRUEI,: The herdsman of crea- tion goes on his ever-proceeding path.

T; 6. 57. 2). The other gods are of3Tered Soma; Indra is the greatest Soma drinker. SEarambha is sometimes added to his drink (3. 52.1; 3.52.7; 8.91.2). Another God, too, seems to have been of3Tered food, though not only ko rambha and not exclusive of the Soma oblation. In the hymn to Food (1.187), nourishment is extolled, the mighty strengthener of divine ordi- ance. It was Trita who, strengthened by food, dismembered Vrtra ill all his joints ( 1.187.1 ) - In this feat Trita is a kind of double of Indra, the Creator of the cosmos, who killed the dragon Vrtra. In his fight with the dragon, Indra was invigorated again and again by draughts of Soma, the Elixir of Life. Trita prefigures, and in part coalesces (10. 8. 8-9) with Indra in killing Visvarupa. But Trita derived part of his strength from food ( pitUX ; 1.187.1 ) . Pit¢ is nourishment, easily assimilated, liquid food, milk, butter and gruel. This is why the plants are invoked to become gruel (karambha) first and then to be transmuted into fat (1.187.10). Karambha, the life-sustaining food, is the Food of Life. It is mixed with the Elixir of Life, the Soma, in the morning offerings to Indra (3. 52. 1) when it has been prepared for Indra, in the company of Pusan (3. 52. T) . Then a new day begins with yet another victory of Indra. But as a rule Indra drinks Soma and Pusan wants Earambha ( 6. 57. 2 ) . Pusan shares equally with Soma in the sacrifice (10.26.5).57 Ee re- ceives a special sacrifice (6. 50. 5 ), the importance of his sacrificial food is stressed. :EIis share is the food of Life, " our daily bread-" Ee himself is the Nourisher (Pusan), dwelling in the sun. He is its glowing nucleus and the concreted substance of Savitr's vibrant impulsion. As such he is the stuf itself of the food of life. The relation of the food of life with the solar power underlies also a rite described in later scripture in which a piece of gold is placed on a disc made of flour. This is called "worship of the solar disc."58 67 Pratyardhir yajnanam refers to Pusan and Soma ( 10. 26. 5 ) and not to Pusan and the other gods, as suggested by Geldner, Der Rig Veda III, p. 163, and Atkins, I. c., p. 89. The relation of Pusan to karambha on the one hand and of Indra to Soma on the other is the subject of 6.57.2,6; 6.56.1,2; 3.52,1,7; 7.53.1 and in view of this relation, Pusan is called Indra's brother ( 6. 55. 5 ) . 68 Atharvaveda Parifiista 12, The PariSistas of the :Earambha, " gruel," the sacrificial food of Pusan, is equal in value (10.26.5) to Soma, the sacrificial drink of Indra and the other gods. Soma is the elixir of life, Earambha is the food of life. Food sustains the body and, together with the body, it sustains existence on any of its levels. Existence lives by its desires. All objects of desire are its food. Pusan is Earambhat, the eater of the food of life (6. 56. 1 ) . He is activated by desire (kamena krta 6. 49. 8; 6. 58. 3, 4) . Food satisfies desire. Where unceasing love and desire have their unending food life is immortal. "Where love and desires [are met], where the highest place of the shining red sun is, where food is and satiety, there make me immortal." (9. 113. 10) 59 These are the inexhaustible and imperishable worlds where the sun dwells and eternal light ( 9. 113. 7 ) . Pusan, whose sacrificial food is gruel,6° the food of life, the food (ssadha) by which he as the sun, the red shining one (bradhna), glows (aghrnt), activated by desire and fulfilled in it, is self-offered (sva- dhavan ), complete and at rest within himself throughout the perpetual movement of his path. Ee is steadfast (10.26.8), this Lord of Nurture (6. 58. 4), an infallible guardian (1. 89. 5), of constance ordinance (10.139.3), the guardian of every pathway (6. 49. 8; pathas-pathah paripatim) all around, on the descending path of the Fathers, at the crossroad in the depth, on the ascending way Atharva Veda; ed. G. M. Bolling and J. V. Negelein, Leipzig, 1909-10. 69 Food: stadh. Svadha has two meanings, (a) self- determination and ( b ) satisfaction of one's own desire (Grassmann, s.v.). In the latter sense it means sacri- ficial food, and particularly the food offered to the Fathers. It appears that self determination or inde- pendence is a secondary meaning based on that of " self- procured, self-offered " ( sta-dha). In this sense the gods, including Pusan, are called " stad havan " ( 6. 58. 1) which is translated as independent and could be rendered as self-offered. Food (stadhd) is given its place in the creation hymn 10. 129. 5. There the gods are spoken of as being thts side of creation ( 10. 129. 6) +shere food (stadha) is, here below, whereas above this line are the creative powers who give their seed. This dichotomy of creation is " in principio," in the beginning of things. Ante principiurn no division exists, desire and satisfaction coalesce in the imperishable world of light, in heaven (cf. 9. 113. 9,10). 6° Gruel (made of rice) and the gruel pot are symbols of the sun.

By the effort of her teeth, by her creative intent, she draws the Creator towards her. The part which the teeth play in the story of Apala's Soma of3Sering to Indra may account for an attribute of Pusan which is given to him in later Vedic texts, in the Epics and Puranas, where he is spoken of as being toothless, although once the toothless god (karudatr) is invoked also in the Rg Veda (4. 30. 24).63 The Vedic myths 64 say that Pusan lost his teeth when he ate a certain part of the Sacrifice. The Sacrifice is Prajapati, the God who sacrificed himself into creation. This is his perennial and ritual aspect. According to a wide spread myth, through his self-sacrifice the cosmos came into ex- istence in the manifoldness of its parts. When performing the sacrificial rites and building up the symbolic body of Prajapati, which is the altar, man, the sacrificer who identifies himself with the altar, regains the original wholeness of Prajapati. But the myth of Prajapati, the Lord, tells of him as cohabiting with his daughter, the Sky or Dawn. This is his aspect as Prajapati proper, which means " Lord of progeny." At that moment God Rudra aimed at him and pierced him. Ealf of Prajapati's seed fell to earth. The gods applied remedies to Prajapati and cut out of him the flesh pierced by the arrow. Rudra of3Sered that morsel of Prajapati who is the sacrifice to Pusan. Pusan ate the morsel and it knocked out his teeth. Rudra's arrow pierces Prajapati at the moment when first he spends himself into creation. The entry of God into his creation and his becoming manifest in it-where he is but a part of himself- is a fragmentation. Rudra himself was generated when part of Prajapati's seed had fallen on earth.65 All this happened when time was not as yet, at the dawn of creation.

Vastospati is Rudra (T. S. 3. 4. 10. 4). of the gods and at the heights where he leads Surya, the Bride. Pusan, glowing substance of solar power in its course, the giver of food, is sacrificially sustained by food. He is an "eater of food" (karambhat; 6. 56. 1).61 Earambha was added also at one special occasion to Indra's Soma of3Sering. Apala, a young woman was the daughter of Atri, a princi- pial sacrificer, who had freed the sun from the magic of Svarbhanu, the demon of obscuration (5.40.8). Deserted by her husband because her skin was diseased and she had lost her hair, Apala, " she without a protector," went to the water of the river, where she found Soma (plants) on her way. She takes them home in order to press them for Indra and makes an offering to him so as to draw him towards her, and he will let her hair grow again. She presses out the Soma juice with her teeth (8.91.2), Indra hears the grinding sound and comes to accept her of3Sering of Soma, pressed by her teeth, and mixed with karambha and other cereals. Loss of hair indicates loss of creative power, loss of the inner light- To remedy this sickness, Apala makes an of3Sering to Indra by the strength of her teeth. The strength of the teeth shows will at work for the sake of survival.62 This is one of the reasons for the use in India, to this day, of the tusks of the boar as an amulet. Apala's desire for union with the Creator, with Indra, makes her creative will work through her teeth on the Soma plant so that the Elisir of Life may bring to her Indra, in whom she will find her protector and in whom she will lose her identity, be rid of her isolation as one defiled by a failing of her inner light.

Edgerton in JAOS 40 (1920) pp. 101-2). The assurance " Pusan, I do not slight thee " ( 1. 138. 4; cf. also 1.42.10) conveys a similar attitude. It would appear that Pus. an is an ancient god and so is Trita, the alter ego of Indra. Food ofTerings were the share, it appears, of the ancient gods; grain, and the marrow and milk of animals.

This arrow, stuck in the wound of the Progenitor's flesh, is the morsel of sacrificial food which knocks out the teeth of Pusan. Rudra's parricidal wrath is directed against the Father spending himself into creation. The wound which he inflicts and the dart in the wound, the furor of the Existent on account of its existence away from the whole- ness which was prior to the beginning of things-is the sacrificial fare offered to Pus;an to eat.

From the highest point of his orbit, Ife +srho be- holds all ( 2. 40. 5 ), who is the M eavel} of the raiment of sheep (10. 26. 6), the roldeIl fleece may he hold out his right hand,66 sho+r tlse way and protect those whom he leads from tlsis workl where the sun shines, to the darkening realms of the Fathers. " WIay he deliver tllem to t11e Fathers" (10.17.3). As soon as the heights of his I'atll alze reaehed. Oll the forward leading path, sThere he chooses to become the son of the Aslrins, Pusan earries for- ward the movement of the cosmos, the round of existence. From the crossroad in the lhepthn Pusan, the SOI-1 of Libelation, had led up on the way of the gods,'&gt;i 66 The hands and the feet are the '; organs of action.^' Pusan's specific activity requires him to put down but one leg-the axis of the cosmos, and to hold out one hand, the right one, in the direction of his course. The right hand is the hand of action, in particular, and it r emains unstained in its shining puritfr even zvllere it points for+A7ard on the dontn+aTard path " tlle evil [sin- ister] ^Ta,v'* (10.13t.2). eT The belief in the t^ro ravs, tlle Daksil.ltl,yana, tlle +Xt!7 to the South, tlle +^Tav of the Fathers, and tlle to the highest heaven, the worlds of Light, in the lap of Savitr (1. 35. 6) 68 whence those who have followed his path are set free from the Itound, in the third and highest heaven of the flowing light of the Godhead. Having passed the High Noon of his cycle, Pusan gathers his flock on the de- seending path and drives down the Sun's golden wheel (6. 56. 3). On the downward path, and while still at the height of his orbit, Pusan is the Friend of " everyone who desires " (10. 26. 8) . The way he leads them depends on the nature of their desires. His herd, who desire well-being and the goods of this earth, riches and prosperity, he guides in his bounty down that way where those who are now the Fathers have trod before them. Those who long for the light he contacts in his golden ships on the straight and quick road at the high noon of inspiration. :He leads them straight to the treasure and they know " here it is." Pusan leads the seer, the Rsi, and the herd, he measures out time to each on his vwraJr to the goal. The path to the Treasure is an iilstant long or it leads round where Pusan holds out his right help- ing hand. Pusan leads Gt,ll men to the place where their treasure is, their goal and destiny (6. 54. 2, 4, T). It is a going together, and it is a union with Pusan.69 " O Pusan, bring us together with the :linower [of the way] who shall direct us straight ahead (anjasa) and who shall say: This here it is" (6.54.1). "May we be united with Pusan who shall point out the dwellings and say: These here they are " (6. 54. 2).7° " May none be injured, may none be destroyed in the pit, rather Uttarayana, the ^=ay to tlle " nortll,'' zxrhicll is tlle zaTacT of the gods, the wa of Liberation, is the belief in PusanSs path.

"May Piisan beyond give his right hand [leading us] around (6. 54.10).71 May he drive back to us what was lost " (6. 54. 10) . " This here it is," instantaneous illumination, the immediate recognition of those whom Pusan leads the straight, swift way. " These here they are," the dwellings of the Fathers, where men of gOod action abide, whither they have gone ( 10. 17. 3-4). They have gone there on the downward road in the declining patll of the sun, the round of the way where the dangers of darkness lie in wait for them, the evil wolf who watches with malicious intent, the waylayer, the thief, the two- faced evil one with burning dart (1. 42. 2-4). This is the darkness of the pit when the sun has gone down and the wolf takes charge of the perils of the night on the approach to the pit. On this perilous journey Pusan guards his flock. As he had helped " our fathers " so he should lead us fearlessly and undiminished in men and strength (10.17. 5) be- yond the pursuers, to a pasture rich in grasWs (1.42-5). The perils of the way reach their depth in the pit (kevata) where the two-faced evil threatens fall and destruction. But Pusan leads his flock, he leads to the houses 72 Of the Fathers those who will now join them. Through the flames of Fire Agni leads the others to the gods, (10.17. 3), when Pusan as son of Liberation (1.42.1) puts down his foot on the two-faced evil (1. 42. 4). Hence, from the parting of the ways Pusan, the Liberator goes rightbefore us (1.42.1) upwardtothegods. Pusan leads those who have died to their sta- tions, and guides them to their homes in the cycle of his path. He leads the living, too, in the same direction, the sinners and seers as well, right down into the pit, where he probes, rends and opens the hearts of the misers, the ungenerous, who have nothing to give, the unproductive, who hoard what they grasp (6. 53. 5-6). Here, in the pit, his goad (ara) probes and pricks the conscience, tears, 71 Par* hastam dadhatu, " give [put] his hand around," parastat " beyond " is replaced by purastat (in front) in AV 7. 9. 4, " ahead, leading." 72 The dwellings or houses (grha; 6. 54. 2) are where the pious have their seat (yatrasata), whither they have gone (10. 17. 4). The two stations of Pusan, on the forward ( leading ) path of Heaven, on the forward ( leading ) path of Earth, are the Supreme Stations or dwellings ( 10. 17. 6 ) . rends and opens the heart of everyone And those who tremble in their heart until they vibrate with the rhythm of his golden wand are the 'Vipras,' the "vibrant" singers. Stung by the "brahma- stimulating goad " (6. 53. 8), they soar with form giving power, the creative power of the poet. To the parting of the ways Pusan leads the dead who are to join the Fathers; thence he gives his hand to those who have died on earth and go the way of the gods. The herdsman of creation guides the living the same path. They come to their hour of trial, each one of the herd. He goads them to the two-faced evil one and there he swings his golden weapon, the best wielder of the golden Vasl and leads beyond their pursuers to pastures rich in grass (1. 42. 8) where the sun shines and there will be no "new heat," no burning firebrands which rage down in the animal nature of the herd. Down there, whither the path of the Fathers goes and whence the path of the gods ascends, a commutation takes place of the values of this earth with its material aims and death, and the immortal treasures of the spirit. At this parting of the way the Son of Liberation is born in whom Pusan has his other, his second birth. It is here, at the cross- road, that Agni the Fire and Spark of Life finds and is Pus. an. In the glowing union of their natures the flaming pillar of life shoots up to the Eeights. It is there, in the Pit, that Pusan finds Soma, the hidden :King of Splendour, not of this earth, sparkling with the elixir of Life, of im- mortality. Pusan ascends and sprinkles with the Soma drops the pastures of man. Their fields grow rich with the nourishment that Pusan dispenses, their mind-souls are saturated as giving of himself, he leads them upward. Pusan is the guide of the quick and the dead, throughout the cycle of his course, aeviternally and in the hour of need. But on the straight, swift path of ecstatic absorption he leads the seers and the sages, right to the Treasure, the shining wealth of illumination,73 by his swelling, soaring might (vatapyam) in their inner vision (dhtti; 10.26. 2).74 There they see as one and the same in his 73 " Vasu " is Light, splendour, the " treasure," wealtll. The *vealth and prosperity which Pusan leads is ex- pressed in terms of cows, and horses. They represent the substance and power respectively of light. 74 Pusan is viseamirwah (2. 40. 6) pervading all and</page><page sequence="19">122 KRAMRISCH: Piisan cycle the Nourisher in his sacred aspect and majesty, glowing in the darkness of their night where he arises 75 as Liberator (vimocana), swing- bhuvane viKve arprtah ( 6. 58. 2 ) which can be understood as ' inserted in the whole universe ' but also as ' inserted in every creature.'

In this moment Pusan is symbolically one with Aja Ekapad and with the pillar of Life (10.5.6; note 16). ing his golden weapon at the crossroad, at the depth of his cyclical path, where he finds the lIidden King Soma, like a lost animal. And they see him, having found what had been lost (6. 54. 10), now at the other pole of his circuit, aglow with love, at the zenith of creation, at the wedding of Surya. Pusan leads the Bride towards Soma, across heaven, in their home, the Sun. TIIE TIIEORY OF DEFINITION IN INDIAN LOGIC J. F. STAAL UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA 1. qIE THEORY OF DEFINITION according to the Indian logicians has been repeatedly studied in a wider context. Foucher has given a description cf its treatment in the Tarka-samyraha, a well- known manual of Indian logic written in the seventeenth century, and in some of its commen- taries; 1 Ingalls has studied its use in the new school (navya-nyaya) ;2 and Mlle. Biardeau has considered its place in the development of Indian thought in general.3 In the present paper a for- malization will be given of the theory of definition according to its exposition in the Tarka-samgraha and in some definitions quoted by the Nyaya-kosa (NK) from various logical works.4 In addition we will consider a related concept of Indian logic, expressed by the term samkara. The terms used for definiens ( laksana) and definiendum (laksya) in logic as well as the idea of definition have an interesting prehistory in the work of the Sanskrit grammarians, to which we direct our attention here before considering the logical doctrines. Such a grammatical prehistory of a logical doctrine is not surprising as grammar 1 A. Foucher, Le compendium des topiques ( Paris, 1949) 7-14. 2 D. E. E.

Biardeau, " La definition dans la pensee indienne," Journal Asiatique 245 ( 1957 ) 371-84. 4 MM. Bhlmacarya Jhalaklkar, Nyaya-kosa ( Poona, 1928 ) s. vv. Iaksana, ativyapti, avgapti, asombhava, samkara. was the first discipline in India which developed a scientific technique which in turn influenced or foreshadowed other domains of Indian thought.5 In the Rkpratisakhya (? fourth century B.C.) laksana refers to a grammatical rule.6 In Katya- yana's varttikas ( ? third century B. C.) as quoted by Patanjali in the Mahabhasya, laksana and laksya denote respectively a grammatical rule and its object: sabdo lak.syah sutram laksarwam "the word is the object of the rule, the sitra (of Panini) is the rule." It is said, then, that it is the task of grammar to deal with both laksana and lak.sya.7 Actually, Panini's grammar (fourth cen- tury B. a.) owes part of its fame to the fact that the rules in it do not prescribe how to speak correct Sanskrit, but describe the facts of the language: the examples (drstanta) for the rules are taken from everyday usage (loka). The underlying principle of empiricism was laid down explicitly only much later. Eslrasvamin (twelfth century A. D.) formulates it as: laksyamulam lak$anans "lak$ana has laksya for its base." Nagojlbhat.ta says: laksyanusciri vyakEydnam " interpretation 5 See especially L.
