<plain_text><page sequence="1">Psychoanalytic methods in the history of religion: A personal statement1 DAN MERKUR Abstract For the Scandinavian tradition of the history of religions, in which I was trained, not the numinous, but the experience of the numinous is the sui generis subject matter of the discipline, and historians routinely emphasize the experiential aspects of religions The better to understand religious ex perience, I work interdisciplinarily with psychoanalysis Freud's treatment of group processes as though they were individual psyches and his patholo gizing of religious symbolism are badly dated Current work in both clinical psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic anthropology is more sophisticated My major innovations are two ( 1) Where historians of religions aspire for reli gious devotees to recognize themselves in their portraits of the religions, I seek for devotees additionally to gain insight into the unconscious dimensions of their religions Religions are not reducible to their symbolism, but uncon scious motives influence the imagery that religions use to symbolize their metaphysical concerns (2) 1 also use psychoanalytic findings and methods to contribute to historiography, in some cases as aids to textual exegesis, but more extensively in studies of shamans, prophets, apocalyptists, and mys tics, where psychoanalytic observations on the techniques for inducing and controlling alternate states furnishes historical information that enriches the research findings Zwi Werblowsky (1975 145) suggested that methodology is most appro priately done at intervals of several years, in self-reflection on the methods that one has devised in the meantime, in order to address the concrete circum stances of working with historical data Otherwise, methodology is a case of always sharpening knives and never cutting the meat With your indulgence, 1 This article was first given as a lecture to the Sociology, Psychology, and Anthropology

Berlin</page><page sequence="2">328 Dan Merkur I am going to follow Werblowsky's advice, and take the liberty of speaking rather more about how I do my work than modesty would otherwise permit According both to his writings and to the received oral tradition in Scandi navia, for Rudolf Otto (1931, 1932, 1950), it was not the holy, but the experi ence of the holy, that was sui generis It was not the numinous, but the sense of the numinous, that he proposed as the defining criterion of the historical phenomena of religion For Otto, Nathan Soderblôm, and their Scandinavian students, the history of religions has always been concerned with so-and-so's experience of the holy; whereas for Gerardus van der Leeuw and Mircea Eliade it was the holy in so-and-so's experience The latter is an ontologi cal claim, not a phenomenological one (Drobin 1982) By all means, Otto, Soderblôm, and many others wore two hats, writing sometimes as theologians and other times as historians of religion, as I show in a forthcoming article, but their practice may be contrasted with the methodology of Joachim Wach, van der Leeuw, Eliade, and others, for whom the history of religions amounted to a perennial philosophy on historical principles - a metaphysics, rather than a methodologically agnostic historiography (Merkur 1994) It is because the history of religions in Scandinavia was consistent with the phenomenological psychology of Karl Jaspers (1963), much more than with the philosophical phenomenology of Husserl, that Scandinavian historians of religions have frequently included discussions of religious experiences in their research To cite only English language publications, in addition to the psychological theories of Hjalmer Sundén (Kallstad 1987; Sundén 1987, Holm 1987, Wik strôm 1987, van der Lans 1987), the massive study of Ecstasy, or Religious Trance by Ernst Arbman (1963-1970), and the examinations of the expe rience of miracles by Arbman (1939) and Erland Ehnmark (1935, 1939), I would note the discussion of ecstatic versus non-ecstatic prophetism in Alfred Haldar's Associations of Cult Prophets among the Ancient Semites (1945), the concern with hypnagogic states in Geo Widengren's Literary and Psy chological Aspects of Hebrew Prophecy (1948), the discussion of prophetic inspiration during trance states in Johannes Lindblom's Prophecy in Ancient Israel (1962), Martin Persson Nilsson's (1948, 1951,1957) habitual attention to the experiential side of Greek religion, Tor Andrae's (1935, 1987) stud ies of Muhammad's inspiration and Sufism, Harris Birkeland's (1955) notice of a motif of shamanic initiation in Muhammad's legend, Martti Haavio's Vainamoinen (1952), which interpreted motifs in the Finnish Kalevala in terms of shamanic experiences, the contributions of Lauri Honko (1969) and Anna-Leena Siikala (1978) on Siberian shamanism, Âke Hultkrantz's work on Lapp (Hultkrantz 1962-1963, 1978, Bàckman - Hultkrantz 1978) and na tive American shamanism (Hultkrantz 1957, 1967, 1973, 1979, 1985, 1986, 1992), and several other studies of shamanism by his students (Berglie 1986, 1978, 1982, Adalsteinsson 1978, Bâckman 1982, 1986, Merkur 1992) It is</page><page sequence="3">Psychoanalytic methods in the history of religion 329 indicative of this tradition of research (see also Edsman 1967, Hartman - Edsman 1970, Holm 1982) that Geo Widengren signed himself as "Professor of the History and Psychology of Religions", and not as a historian alone Consistent with this crucial distinction in the understanding of phe nomenology, the history of religions in Scandinavia has traditionally had the social sciences as its conversation partners By contrast, the tradition stemming from van der Leeuw, whose greatest champion was Eliade, has had theology and philosophy as its conversation partners Underlying the Scandinavian approach to the history of religions is the assumption that most people are religious because they personally have reli gious experiences Good and bad fortune may be attributed to demons, spirits, gods, God, karma, or what you will Both conversions and subsequent en counters with numinous beings and states of existence may proceed through dreams, visions, voices, or mystical unions As well, notice needs to be taken of occasional, highly emotionally charged rites These orders of religious ex perience are, for those who have them, the very core of religion itself In the Scandinavian approach, people believe in myths, they subscribe to the ologies, they engage in tedious rites, precisely because they have religious experiences For devotees, religious experiences confirm, prove, modify, ex tend - in short, motivate - the balance of what religion entails To start one's study of a religion by prioritizing myth, theology, ritual, symbolism, scrip tures, or other texts is to put the cart before the horse To use Gordon Allport's (1950) terms, what is at stake is whether to give pride of place to extrinsic religiosity or to intrinsic Since all major religious thinkers, on a world basis, together with probably most religious functionaries, are as deeply involved with religion as they are, only because they are intrinsics, it is a question of prioritizing the personalities to whom religions look for leadership Conse quently, to be a competent historian, one must know enough about religious experience to be able organize one's discussion of religion around its ex periential core A scholar who does not know as much psychology as the religious devotees under study cannot understand their self-explanations well enough to do a decent job of historiography In contrast with the tradition of my teachers, I am willing to adopt a phenomenological approach to metaphysical questions, but not additionally to scientific ones Methodological agnosticism does not require a denial of philosophical realism Scholars who use the term "reductionism" as a pe jorative are in the position, so I believe, of the churchman who refused to look through Galileo's telescope, lest he be convinced that the sun had spots and was imperfect (Merkur 1994) Whatever one may think of God, or what or whom you will, the validity of metaphysical propositions is the same for people as for nonhuman animals If there is a God, cattle and sheep and dogs and horses and swine and goats all have God, yet they have no religion</page><page sequence="4">330 Dan Merkur People have religion, as nonhuman animals do not, for reasons of human nature, not metaphysics Because psychology studies human nature, it cannot be reductive unless theological incompetence has first committed idolatry by confounding psychology with metaphysics Among the various possible approaches to psychology, I have opted for psychoanalysis, the orthodox Freudian school of depth psychology My choice has several motives First, a scientific one Despite philosophers' in ability to explain the possibility of its existence, there is such a thing as self-deception As Freud demonstrated beyond all serious question, there is unconscious thinking, and the manifest irrationality of symbols is an accom modation of resistance to self-knowledge As well, I have a pragmatic historiographie motive Aristotle, Paul, Au gustine, Maimonides, and a great many more of the giants of Western re ligion had theories of knowledge, or of the soul, that were forerunners of modern theories of the unconscious The traditional theories cannot be un derstood phenomenologically by a scholar whose methods are limited to the psychology of consciousness, whether behavioral, cognitive, humanistic, or transpersonal Again, the mainstream of the Judaeo-Christian mystical tra dition, from biblical prophets through the kabbalists, Jesuits, and modern charismatics, has followed the biblical legend of Joseph in submitting dream and vision imagery to allegorizing interpretations in a fashion that antici pated psychoanalysis Anyone working, for example, with apocalyptic texts that present both visions and their interpretations needs a system of psy chology that has the sophistication necessary to distinguish the manifest and latent contents of religious experiences, which pretty much limits the field to psychoanalysis, since neither academic psychology nor Jung's system of analytic psychology admit the existence of latent contents Let me be clear on this last point If you want to do a gnostic reduction that is a travesty of the Judaeo-Christian tradition, you can by all means be a Jungian This is not to say that Jung had no good points But despite its interest to some modem theologians, a Jungian approach has not the capacity to do justice to the traditional self-understanding of the Judaeo-Christian tradition To these basic reasons for my recourse to psychoanalysis, I will add the less persuasive points that I wish to be able to communicate with medical psychiatry, that I believe that people are as thoroughly sexual as kabbal ists, tantrists, and Freudians have always maintained, and that psychoanal ysis alone among psychological systems views the human being within the context of a family, as having parents, spouse, progeny, and so forth, rather than as an isolate or, in social psychology, as a person having social relations with undifferentiated others Now, I must be clear that I am not talking of the pioneering but dated work of Freud By psychoanalysis, I refer to a thriving scientific discipline that</page><page sequence="5">Psychoanalytic methods in the history of religion 331 continues to grow and to change as facts and intellectual fashions warrant The ill-informed and unduly speculative productions on religion that clinicians have penned in their spare time should be considered the work of amateurs and no reflection of the standards of professional psychoanalytic research Neither do I propose to defend the utility for religious studies of psycho analysis as a whole Although I subscribe to an orthodox Freudian view of psychosexual development, my historical research rarely has reason to refer to it I have begun to do so in the classroom, however, in connection with a procedure in psychoanalytic anthropology that Géza Róheim (1932, 1950) pioneered but is more often associated with its formal proposal by Abram Kardiner (1939, 1945, 1958, see also Arlow 1961, Boyer 1979) Alan Dun des's Life is Like a Chicken Coop Ladder (1984) is for beginners perhaps the most accessible example that I know of this method In this procedure, facts are organized in order to show that culturally shared practices of child rearing result in emotional crises and personalities that are typical for the cultures, that the typical crises are reflected in the symbolism, both whole some and morbid, of the cultures and their religions, and that the cultural and religious practices serve, in a hermeneutic circle, to reinforce and perpetuate the childrearing practices Where the psychoanalytic anthropologists who developed the methodol ogy were interested in cultural symbol systems as wholes, I have found that my use of their results, and similar contributions of my own, have a distinct significance in the classroom The goal of the history of religions to por tray religions well enough that devotees find the portraits accurate, has, in the classroom, the function of reducing ethnocentric prejudices by explaining the self-understandings of other religions The reality of the other is used to falsify ethnocentric demonizations of the other What is not achieved by the traditional pedagogy of the history of religions is self-reflection or insight into the sources and motives of demonization Projections are falsified and disclosed as projections, but the unconscious sources of the projections - in Kleinian terms, the split-off bad objects, in Jungian terms, the shadow - is neither confronted, detoxified, nor worked through Indeed, in their efforts to portray religions on devotees' terms, historians of religions regularly ne glect even to discuss devotees' views of other religions their heresiologies, racisms, ethnocentricities, chauvinisms, persecution fantasies, and so forth The malignant aspects of religions have been played down in academia, for the most part because they are neither cheery nor edifying (Smith 1982) The result, however, is an unduly optimistic or sentimentalized portrait of reli gions that misdirects attention from the recognition and analysis of religions' problematic features To address this deficiency, I have begun systematically to present religions, in the classroom, both in the traditional phenomenological manner and with</page><page sequence="6">332 Dan Merkur close attention to the uncomfortable truths, the self-deceptions, hypocrisies, and worse outrages that religious devotees prefer to avoid acknowledging In addition to a conventional effort to portray religions as coherent systems, I have begun to devote attention to historical data that are inconsistent, irrecon cilable, or conflicting Manifest inconsistencies, evident as such to devotees, provide a point of departure for the enterprise A second order of data is supplied through functionalist analysis Whenever a religious practice serves a coherent function that devotees do not consciously intend, the practice is more likely a product of unconscious motivation than it is of random happenstance Conventional psychoanalytic approaches to the problems of self-deception - ranging from denial through reaction-formations, as well as the projections that Kleinians and Jungians discuss - permit the empirical ev idence of conflicting motives to be organized in ways that link, for example, culturally distinctive features of religions with culturally distinctive aspects of childhood experience My goal in this enterprise, I have belatedly come to recognize, is therapeu tic In the same fashion that historians of religions have traditionally felt their work to be confirmed when devotees recognize themselves in the historians' portraits, I find that I am seeking devotees, within my classes' religiously pluralistic student population, to experience the liberating power of insight into their culturally shaped resistances In short, as I adapt the methodology of psychoanalytic anthropology, I seek not only to falsify the demonization of the other, but to promote therapeutic insight into the sources of ethnocentric alienation Another existing psychoanalytic method that has proved successful in the study of religion is psychobiography Although it is often said that a psy choanalysis cannot be done without access to the analysand's dreams and free associations, the psychoanalysis of historical individuals is more reliable than is generally recognized The situation is closely analogous to that of modern biblical criticism, where studies that stay close to the received text are inherently more persuasive than studies that postulate intricate source divisions and inherently indemonstrable textual emendations Erik Erikson's Young Man Luther (1958) has proved a classic precisely because Erikson did not attempt as thoroughgoing and detailed an account of Luther's uncon scious motivation as a clinical case report would ordinarily be expected to contain Erikson was content to psychoanalyze those aspects of Luther's life for which we have adequate data On the other hand, I have no use whatever for the method of psychohistory that Freud introduced in Moses and Monotheism (1939) that psychoanalyzes the development of religions as though they were the development of indi viduals Freud's discussion of entire epochs by reference to such phenomena as the Oedipus complex, and so forth, presupposed the now long discredited</page><page sequence="7">Psychoanalytic methods in the history of religion 333 theory of the monolinear evolution of religion, with all its ethnocentric and teleological implications Freud's method also postulated the existence of a group mind, with a group id, a group ego, and a group superego - all of which I regard as utter fictions that are worthless and misleading even when treated as metaphors I also try to avoid the method of "applied psychoanalysis" that Freud introduced in Totem and Taboo (1939) This method, which has long been the mainstay of Freudian work on religions, psychoanalyzes the symbols of religions as though they were the neurotic symptoms of individuals Because defenses are symptoms that the ego institutionalizes as habits of thought for reason of their secondary advantages (Freud 1926), the analysis of religious symbols as though they were neurotic defenses (Spiro 1965) comes to much the same thing Whether reference is made to symptoms or defenses, psycho analytic theories that have been developed in clinical practice are "applied" to cultural data Cultural data are used as evidence by which to corroborate clinical findings, precisely by imposing the theories on the data, without due regard for the fact that the data are non-clinical The procedure amounts to a Procrustean bed Because the clinical data are almost invariably pathological, the method of applied psychoanalysis routinely pathologizes cultural data It is not really able to do otherwise It is simply not possible to do an honest job of psychoanalyzing cultural data until and unless cultural data are treated as primary evidence in their own right, for the development of theories on their exclusive basis, whether or not the theories corroborate clinical findings Lip-service has sometimes been paid to the distinction that Ernst Kris (1936) introduced between regression and regression in the service of the ego Apart from Anthony Wallace (1956a, 1956b, 1966) and a few other anthropological writers (e g, Ducey 1976), there have been few sustained efforts in psychoanalysis to portray religions as creative influences, rather than morbid ones No one has ever worked out a coherent theory to explain the crucial difficulty that regression in the service of the ego is invariably a conscious endeavour, while people apply most religious symbolism un thinkingly, by rote Even shamans, mythmakers, and theologians who engage professionally in creative religiosity, perform most rituals by way of course Much as I have been inspired by the views of D W Winnicott (1953, 1966, 1971) and Paul Pruyser (1974,1983) to attempt to view culture, includ ing religion, as a developmental successor to children's play, I am not able to embrace Winnicott's concepts of "transitional objects" and "transitional phe nomena" Winnicott's concepts presuppose the Kleinian view (see Guntrip 1971 57), explicitly stated by Winnicott (1987 43), that despite the ontolog ical reality of the cosmos, human psychology is epistemologically solipsistic To locate religion as somehow "transitional" between solipsism and realism is not meaningful to me Pruyser was undoubtedly right, however, to emphasize</page><page sequence="8">334 Dan Merkur Winnicott's revalorization of illusory experience To call religion an illusion (Freud 1927) is to make religion equivalent to children's play (Winnicott 1966, 1971) Like beauty and morality, it is both valid and veridical without being demonstrable to anyone for whom existential truths are unpersuasive (I add, however, that in likening religion to beauty and morality, I do not endorse an indiscriminate relativism that approves all works of art, all ethical standards, and all religious usages ) Taking van der Leeuw slightly out of context, Pruyser also suggested that numinous phenomena concern limit-situations, points beyond which the mind cannot reason Examples are the beginning, meaning, and end of existence, and the problem of evil or, more generally, the problem of qualitative values More and more, I am coming to think that religions perennially address a discrete set of logical problems that the cosmos is so constructed that every world-view must include logical paradoxes, that these mysteries are inher ently insoluble and consequently arouse the feelings, noted by Otto, of awe, urgency, and fascination How religions identify cognitive limit-situations, how they attempt partial solutions to the mysteries by recourse to metaphys ical speculations, and how they behave in consequence, are all culturally and historically variable What is clear, however, is that religions, no differ ently than the sciences, make extensive use of metaphors in order to express abstract concepts (Merkur 1988a) In other words, the latent content of reli gious symbolism is theological Because it is often theology that has never been formulated in abstract conceptual terms, but has only been expressed by means of symbolism, the metaphors are very frequently subject, as Pruyser noted, to both naive and morbid reifications If my view is correct, psychoanalytic methods may address unconscious motives influencing the choice of manifest religious imagery, but the latent meaning of the images remains theological For example, unconscious atti tudes to fathers inform the symbolization of God as a father, but the raison d'être of the symbol remains the metaphysical proposition of God In speak ing of God as a father, devotees do not intend the term literally God does not engage in biological reproduction, nor in reproduction of any kind There was never a time when he was not God is discussed under the symbol of a father, as a metaphoric means by which to speak of God The image of the metaphor arises out of human biology, but because the image is used as a metaphor, its latent meaning remains an assertion about God It is an error in psychoanalytic method, a category mistake in diagnosis, to confound metaphors known as such with symbols whose symbolic character is un conscious On the other hand, Pruyser's position also implies a breath-taking vista Psychoanalytic research has an entirely new set of problems to address the diagnostic implications not of metaphoric religious symbols, but of their naive and morbid reifications</page><page sequence="9">Psychoanalytic methods in the history of religion 335 Since my literature review has drifted from psychoanalytic methods in the history of religions to general questions of the psychoanalysis of religion, let me emphasize the distinction between the use of religious data as evidence for contributions to psychoanalysis, and the use of psychoanalytic findings and methods for contributions to historiography To tell us, for example, that several Former Prophets often behaved irrationally and violently in a manner consistent with certain uses of trance states, or that apocalyptic writers rarely hallucinated in the technical sense of the term, or that Paul knew he was neurotic where Augustine did not, is to tell us matters that may be of genuine psychological interest However, they contribute no more than footnotes to historical research They do not solve the type of problems that worry historians For this reason, most historians usually find it sufficient to offer a general psychological theory in a few pages, an essay, or a chapter, more or less as declarations of their positions In all subsequent studies, the general theory is taken for granted, and research proceeds on purely historical-philological criteria Only very rarely have the priorities been reversed and has psychoanalysis been employed in the service of normative historical research Priority may be assigned to three flawed works of biblical scholarship by Theodor Reik (1959, 1960, 1961) and an equally unpersuasive biblical study by David Bakan (1979) More recently, Gerd Theissen, writing from a mostly but not exclusively psychoanalytic perspective, discussed Psychological Aspects of Pauline Theology (1987) and Alan Segal opted instead for cognitive psy chology in his study of Paul the Convert (1990) Bakan (1991) has done a fine book on Maimonides, and David Halperin (1987, 1993) used orthodox psychoanalytic methods in an essay on Hekhalot Rabbati and a splendid (but at points speculative) book on Ezekiel No doubt there have been other con tributors whose work I do not know or have forgotten My own contributions started a couple years before Theissen, on the basis of undergraduate studies with Bakan In several publications (Merkur 1981, 1989a, 1991, 1992), psy choanalytic methods permitted me to find coherent, as realistic references to practices of religious experience, what had previously seemed either fabulous myths or incomprehensible religious doctrines As well, in two further es says (Merkur 1985, 1988b), I argued from psychoanalytic premises, among other matters, for the solution of several exegetical problems Word choices that exegetes found highly problematic proved to make excellent sense once attention was paid to the latent content of the prophetic writings For methodological purposes, my recent book on the practice of gnosis from Nag Hammadi through Western occultism (Merkur 1993) is probably the best example of my work on ecstatic religious traditions Conventional histories of mysticism may self-consciously describe themselves as studies of mystical doctrines Several Islamicists are nearer the mark, however, in</page><page sequence="10">336 Dan Merkur confessing that they are really studying only the semantics, and not even the doctrines, of the Sufis - because you can never know what a term means doctrinally, unless you can place it in its intended historical context For this reason, it is my conviction that conventional histories of prophetism, apocalypticism, mysticism, and so forth, that limit themselves to doctrinal formulations are not accurate histories of the ecstatics' ideas The studies misrepresent the ecstatics' ideas because they take their words out of the historical context of their experiences The historical theologies of the ecstat ics were inextricably experiential Their ideologies cannot be understood in isolation of their references to psychological phenomena The conventional scholarly fixation on doctrinal formulations also skews the mainstream of the debate on the nature of mystical experiences, where the defenders of Neo-Vedantic theology and perennial philosophy are still contesting Steven Katz's (1978, 1982, 1983, 1992, Almond 1982) modest thesis that there occur no unmediated experiences My own work has gone a different direction I began with the assumption that unconscious criteria, which are applicable cross-culturally, can be used to establish a typology of religious experiences Where conventional historiographie work assembles individual facts into manifestly logical relations, a psychoanalytic hermeneu tic permits facts also to be brought into relation when they form irrational but psychologically meaningful syndromes A psychoanalytic methodology increases the quantity of data that can usefully be organized into a histori cal narrative To identify the syndromes on scientific principles, preparatory to the task of historiography, I conducted surveys as a graduate student of the literature on peak experiences, psychedelic experiences in both Western and native American cultures, and trance experiences Apart from an arti cle on the theory of hypnosis (Merkur 1984), what has appeared in print of this research is the general paradigm of the syndromes of trance and reverie states (Merkur 1992 63-108; 1993 3-54, note also the forthcoming article on "The numinous as a category of values"), on which I have drawn ever since As well, my study of psychedelic experiences, The Ecstatic Imagina tion Psychedelic Experiences and the Psychoanalysis of Self-Actualization, is now in press Using psychoanalytic criteria to isolate unconscious psychological syn dromes in religious experiences has made it possible for me to discuss the psychical phenomena of ecstasy and historical religious ideologies as inde pendent variables For many decades previously, historians of religions de fined ecstatic religious traditions in terms of the cognitive contents of ecstatic experiences for example, shamanism, in terms of journeys of the disembod ied soul (Eliade 1964), spirit mediumship, in terms of possession states, mysticism, in terms of mystic union (Underhill 1910), and prophetism, in terms of "revelatory experiences which are partly visual and partly auditory"</page><page sequence="11">Psychoanalytic methods in the history of religion 337 (Lindblom 1962 56) Fifty years ago, when hypnosis was the only alternate state that scientific psychology knew much about, it was reasonable for his torians to differentiate types of ecstasy on cognitive criteria alone Today it is not In the last forty years, literally thousands of essays and books have been published on alternate psychic states, and we find differences among the states, as well as among their contents Both are historical variables Ecstatics in all cultures at all times have had available to them the psychic possibility of attaining any alternate state of consciousness, many of which can accommodate several types of religious experience The potential has never been equalled, however, by historical achievements Ecstatic religious traditions have differed in their familiarity with the varieties of ecstasy; some have been familiar with more varieties than others Historical traditions have also differed in the varieties that they have chosen to employ, they have regularly favoured fewer varieties than were known in their cultures Other varieties have been tolerated Others again have been actively discouraged The natural diversity of alternate states has prevented even the most careful and diligent historical tradition from being as specific in its achievements as its theologians or philosophers might have preferred The sheer variety of religious ecstasies has important methodological con sequences Different ecstatic techniques are needed in order to attain dif ferent alternate states Whenever it is possible to demonstrate that different texts commonly refer to the same variety or varieties of alternate state, we have evidence of a school or tradition of ecstatic practice Some practices are simple and common Others are intricate and rare All are distinctive These are matters of methodological significance Treating the psychology and the ideology of an ecstatic tradition as independent variables allows us to study both continuity and change, in greater detail than is possible through literary criticism alone Ecstatics from a single school of practice can change their ideology Conversely, ecstatics from different schools can share an ide ology As a result, where conventional studies of ecstatics' semantics can show either affinity or no resemblance, my methods permits discussion of four possible relations affinity of both praxis and doctrine, affinity only of praxis, affinity only of doctrine, and no resemblance whatever The result, I contend, is richer, more nuanced, and more accurate historiography Let me close by emphasizing my desire for the normalization of psy choanalytic work in the history of religions In recent decades, sociological, anthropological, and geographical methods have been integrated within con ventional historical-philological research Psychoanalytic methods similarly deserve to become part of the routine training and practice of historians They can help historians do more complete, more accurate, and more judi cious historiography By all means we must get past Freud's cranky hostility to religion and, more importantly, the gross indulgence in speculation that has</page><page sequence="12">338 Dan Merkur rendered many existing contributions worthless There is no intrinsic reason, however, apart from the reverse prejudice of cranky hostility to psychoanaly sis, why good work in psychoanalysis should be any less useful to historians than good work in any other social science Surely something is amiss when we find psychoanalysis valued more by spiritual directors (Barry-Connolly 1981; cf May 1992) than it is among supposedly disinterested historians!
