      <p>The earliest surviving European musical instruments date from the
sixteenth century, a period when humanists considered music a means
to perfection of character and manners. In <italic>Sounding Objects</italic> Carla Zecher focuses on interpretations of instruments by French
Renaissance poets and artists, persuasively contending that as a material
object, an instrument may serve as autobiographical narrator or historical
artifact, its literary and pictorial images arising from its physical
traits, acoustic properties, and social convention. Drawing on a variety
of treatises, poems, engravings, paintings, and part-books, this valuable
study explores instruments as the nexus of graphic entity and auditory
imagination at court, in salons, and in the civic arena.</p>
      <p>Zecher points out that the Renaissance poetic soundscape consisted
mainly of plucked-string instruments, whose ur-string, the lute, was
believed to be descended from the classical lyre. She further observes
that the flexibility of the sometimes generic terms <italic>luth</italic> and <italic>lyre</italic> enabled poets to conflate the classical
and the contemporary, as the metapoetic function of Ronsard’s
odes to the lute and lyre reveals his ambition to endow France with
a renovated vernacular poetry in the image of antiquity. Whereas court
poet Ronsard chooses the lute for his Pindaric classicizing agenda
and the guitar for his Horatian amatory voice, he refers to his <italic>Franciade</italic> as his “trumpet” (50), a work whose
limited success is announced by the disobedient lyre’s refusal
to play of epic matters in his 1550 “A sa Lire.”</p>
      <p>Zecher views contrasting styles of poets and musical rivalries
between mythological personages as a stringed/wind dichotomy in considering
Pléiade poetry and Fontainebleau visuals. Although Renaissance
poets and painters often followed Platonic thought in depicting wind
instruments as folly and bawdiness associated with popular tradition,
Zecher cautions that literary debates in the 1550s and 60’s
were problematic, destabilizing the aesthetic values commonly accorded
strings and winds. In close readings of Ronsard and Du Bellay, she
examines such debate especially in portrayals of Marsyas’s musical
challenge to Apollo. The satyr’s embodiment of either the old
orality of French poetry or the printed French language’s challenge
to Greek and Latin recalls the “uneasy co-existence” (90)
of Apollonian and Dionysian music making in pictorial arts at Fontainebleau.
Aptly analyzing visual scenes expressing reconciliation between challenger
and victor, Zecher characterizes them as “emblematic of the
difficulties entailed in maintaining musical ideology in the face
of acoustic reality” (93).</p>
      <p>Instruments function as didactic entities, rather than as objets
d’art in urban emblem books, whose meditations on the necessity
for prudence in governance in the courtly and civic arenas accord
legendary musicians a place of prominence. While midcentury emblematists
Coustau, Aneau, and La Perrière endow the lutenist with civilizing
eloquence, Alciato equates the difficulty of tuning many strings with
that of governance, a challenge further reflected in the topos of
the broken lute string in Holbein’s 1533 painting, <italic>The
Ambassadors.</italic> In epigrams, Zecher appropriately notes the
linguistic connections between nonstringed instruments and the dishonest
rhetoric of court advisers, citing the verb <italic>flageoler</italic>, to play the flute or to engage in flattery, a synonym of the medieval
verbs <italic>piper</italic> and <italic>tromper</italic>.</p>
      <p>In lute-poems of the salon, the anthropomorphic instrument may
serve as part of the lutenist’s body or substitute for the absent
lady, fulfilling multiple auto-referential functions, especially related
to sexuality and gender. Analyzing the complex interaction and interdependence
of player and instrument, notably among Lyonnese poets and non-French
painters, Zecher convincingly demonstrates that “the body-centred
language of these poems” (139) reminds us of the blurring of
social and sexual boundaries in women’s lute playing. While
paintings often document the “slippage between the lute as <italic>voluptas</italic> and as the <italic>vita voluptuosa</italic>”
(140), female poets achieve different kinds of “voluptuousness”
(146), in displaying personal gratification found in lute performance,
enabling the “survival of a female poetic self” (151).</p>
      <p>Zecher offers a fascinating glimpse into musical materiality within
the physical spaces and cultural contexts of the upper classes in
sixteenth-century France. Her helpful explanations of critical musical
nomenclature facilitate accessibility for nonmusicians. Carefully
researched, this book’s rich use of illustrations and notes
further enhances contemporary appreciation of the Renaissance interplay
of music, poetry, and art.</p>
