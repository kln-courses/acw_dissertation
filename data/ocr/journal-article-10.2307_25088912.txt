<plain_text><page sequence="1">FORM AND CONTENT in the EARLY WORK OF AARON SIS KIND CARL CHIARENZA For aaron siSKiND, photography was never a detached art. It was and is, however, a symbolic and formalistic one. Siskind has had a fairly consistent "particular, humanistic, and engaged vision" of life (not of some conventionally accepted "objective world"). His purpose in making photographs has been, in his words, "to find a relation between an aesthetic and an idea." How could it have been otherwise for a man who spent a dozen years studying and practicing music and poetry before turning to photography? Siskind's work is the aesthetic result of a direct confrontation with life and a grappling with ideas about human destiny. His concern is with cause, not symptom. He learned very quickly that a photo graph was no more objective an object than the worlds he experi enced. A photograph was, for him, a set of relationships between shapes and tones. He discovered early on that he could control the kinds of relationships that occurred within the photographic frame. Whether he began with people (Illus. 1) or with a shredded broad side (Illus. 2) he could not separate form from content. The two people are two forms; the two forms are two people. The idea moti vating both pictures is a major Siskind motif: that behind the sur face imagery of conversations lies significant revelation of the com plexity of human relationships. We may wish to argue that the "abstract" image is more general in terms of this idea, but that is because some 500 years of accepted conventions of pictorial repre sentation convinces us that the photograph made in 1935 has a specific, identifiable content which is separable from its form, that it is "documentary evidence" of reality. The often remarked change that occurred in Siskind's work in the years 1943-1945, was not a change from documentary to abstract. If it was a change at all, it was a change of referents. What hap pened to his work at that time was more in the nature of a clarifica tion resulting from a long period of exploration of life as well as medium. During the dozen years preceding 1943 he tried to find in photography the visual equivalent of poetry, for it was in poetry that he first found a way to relate his own life's experience to what he believed was the major principle of life in the Western world. He 808</page><page sequence="2">Early Work of Aaron Siskind 2 New York, South Street 1947 called it the principle of duality, which, in its simplest form, is evi denced in the opposition of good and evil, but which can be seen everywhere, including the separation of mind from body, and of form from content. He found the separation of form and content a useful metaphorical tool, one that could best be used to advantage in photography, the medium most stereotypically associated with that separation. In order to understand this in his work, we must trace, if only briefly, some significant aspects of Siskind's life. Siskind was born in 1903 in New York, the fifth of six children. His parents had emigrated from the Ukraine in 1893. His father and grandfather were tailors, the former operating a series of smaller and smaller neighborhood tailor shops, occasionally in the front room of the family's living quarters, always overcrowded because they boarded new immigrants. The elder Siskinds, poor and overworked, with little time for anything beyond survival, were stern and often irritable. Siskind found the atmosphere stifling; as far back as he can remember he was away from home as often as possible. He lived in the streets. Small and bright for his age, he recalls having to prove himself by beating or matching bigger kids. He quickly developed the necessary street savvy to be special. At school he was precocious, and invariably the teacher's pet. 809</page><page sequence="3">Carl Chiarenza By the age of twelve Siskind was listening to political speeches on Broadway; soon after he was making them himself. George Murray Hulbert, a member of the House of Representatives, was impressed with the boy's speeches decrying social injustice and promoting pacifism?this during World War I. Hulbert paid Aaron to speak for him from the back of a campaign truck. Speaking became a way to earn pocket money, and, more significantly, a way to gain a sense of importance. As speechmaker, he travelled to Harlem, witnessed more problems, became a junior member of the Young Peoples' Socialist League. The Junior YPSLs (pronounced yipsels) were messengers, running to polls, getting coffee, reporting problems. Sis kind again became a leader of his group and a favorite of older mem bers. He had found a measure of success and notoriety away from home?he was also attending weekly meetings of an Atheist Society ?and he found adults who took an interest in him. He experienced as well some of the harsher, even brutal, realities of adult political life: Socialist meetings were raided by vigilante groups, the members beaten. And it was at a YPSL meeting that he met Sidonie (Sonia) Glatter, who became the sweetheart of his teen years and who would later become his wife. At De Witt Clinton High School, Siskind's voracious reading ranged from Jack London to the Imagist poets. One of his teachers, Garibaldi Lapolla, encouraged his reading as well as his writing of poetry. Siskind's strong political and social concern very nearly re sulted in his failure to graduate. After witnessing a riot instigated by vigilantes disrupting an open house at the new offices of the New York Call, a Socialist newspaper, Siskind wrote an angry letter to the editor pledging himself to the workers' cause. Siskind was reprimanded for this act by the high school disciplinarian. The principal informed Siskind that he could not vouch for his character?and therefore could not award him a diploma?unless Siskind would sign a docu ment disavowing his political statements. Lapolla, Siskind's primary mentor during these years, and other teachers attempted to inter cede with no effect. The situation was a traumatic one for Siskind who, after considerable discussion, signed. At City College Siskind's political radicalism turned into a cul tural radicalism. The center of his social and intellectual exchange was the college literary society, Clionia?a band of eager young in tellectuals that included Barnett Newman (not yet a painter) and, though not enrolled in the college, Adolph Gottlieb, who had re cently returned from Europe where he had studied painting. Many of the same people belonged to an independent writers' club. These groups replaced Siskind's politically-oriented organizations, and fulfilled his need to belong to an active cause. 810</page><page sequence="4">Early Work of Aaron Siskind Reflected in the poetry that Siskind wrote during this period was his growing attraction to things medieval. He regularly spent quiet hours in such churches as St. John the Divine and St. Thomas. He returned again and again to the Cloisters. In these environments he would read or, when possible, listen to religious music. He practiced, or fought with, the piano and with musical composition; he regularly attended concerts; he owned an enviable collection of records. The poems that have survived contain many references to a god, either Christian or Jewish; to medieval thought, secular and religi ous; and to such polar concepts as good and evil. It was through literature and music that his spiritual needs were met at this period. Though he visited the churches?often with Sonia?and was strongly attracted to the rituals, he never participated or belonged. In college he concentrated on the study of Old and Middle English. He wrote several Middle English translations for The Lavender, "the literary magazine published by Clionia. His medieval interests led him to the Metaphysical poets, although the major personal influences came from Blake and Proust. Siskind was awarded a medal for his poems, some of which were published in The Lavender. Despite all this, Siskind's self-esteem was low, and he gave up trying to be a musician; ulti mately he also gave up writing. But though he gave up poetry, his early writing contains themes that would haunt Siskind all his life. The imagery is often obscure, heavy, dark, slow-moving, mysterious. Like the late photographs, the poems deal continuously with opposing forces. Symbols and meta phors oscillate between the personal and the general. It is in this oscillation that Siskind seems to find a tentative meaning for his life. The poems reveal as well Siskind's struggle with the conflict between raw experience and elusive ideal. The reader is left, as the viewer of the photographs is left, with an image in which he must confront, again and again, the duality of life, what Siskind would later call "the terrors and pleasures of l?vitation." While some kind of faith in regeneration is expressed in the myriad examples of transforma tion through conflict, the poems persistently reveal his skepticism, his doubt, his bitter quest for answers. By the time the poems cited here were written, Siskind had been for about thirteen years the steady companion of Sonia, the girl he had met at YPSL headquarters. The relationship caused significant effects on both. Sonia was mildly epileptic. She was deeply attached to her father, also named Aaron, who died when she was in her teens. Siskind filled the void. During Siskind's last year at CCNY, the couple had their first and only sexual union which resulted in pregnancy and a traumatic abortion. This highly-charged relationship found its way into much of the poetry Siskind wrote. 811</page><page sequence="5">Carl Chiarenza The incongruity of the real (Siskind's experience) and the ideal (his fantasy) is the theme of a considerable number of poems. It was concisely stated in Song, written about 1926: Pale man and paler maid; O which do I prefer?? Those seated on the bank Or the dream of him and her. Siskind's desire, coupled with Sonia's increasing fear of sexuality, led him to write poems about temptation and agony, about desire and phobia. There are many, often quite lengthy. One short poem and an excerpt suggest the implications: Sonia (Acrostic) Sore did I yearn to bring you gifts: to place On your fair body royalty's robe, and grace Nine diamonds in your hair. As quick as thought I proffered these my glamorous gifts; but you (Alas) feared them?and since have feared me too. excerpt from For Her Birthday Walk lightly: Aye, shed your pall of flesh And go as spirit only. The lines reflect the influence of Blake on Siskind's life and work. Siskind's early devotion to Socialism, his defense of the worker, his belief in an unfettered freedom for all men, his pessimism for all organized religion, his use of and feeling for Christian symbolism as relating to essential human qualities, his commitment to an intuitive experience of life without restriction, and perhaps most of all, his continuous attempt to unify the polarities of inherited doctrines, link Siskind to Blake. The need for a reconciliation between opposing forces guided them both. Here it is in Blake's Auguries of Innocence: Joy and Woe are woven fine, A clothing for the soul divine; Under every grief and pine Runs a joy with silken twine. This theme is most directly drawn in Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. 812</page><page sequence="6">Early Work of Aaron Siskind After graduating from CCNY in 1926, Siskind considered a num ber of creative careers. Reluctantly he elected to teach in the public schools. It was a secure occupation at a time of economic distress. He taught seventh and eighth grade English until 1947 when he was transferred to a junior high school which he disliked intensely. He quit the public schools in 1949 to devote himself to photography. Though teaching and associated extra-curricular activities occupied much of his time, it was not an adequate replacement for the YPSLs or Clionia in terms of self-fulfillment. In 1929, Siskind married Sonia. In 1930 they went to Bermuda on a belated honeymoon. As a going-away present for this trip Siskind received his first camera. Outwardly the marriage was compatible. Both taught school, haunted the concert halls, generally led a cul turally rich life. But there were grave difficulties: Sonia's physical and mental problems grew. Epilepsy coupled with severe anxiety led to several attempts at suicide and other dangerous behavior. The mar riage was literally painful to the couple. Sonia'a mental health took a drastic turn in 1937 which led to permanent hospitalization in 1938. From 1939 to 1943, Siskind's life was one of radical experi mentation which fluctuated in tune with the dialectic of guilt and relief in his mind. Siskind was twenty-six years old in 1930 when he received his first camera. The idea, of course, was to make snapshots, visual remembrances?documents. A few years ago, Siskind and I unearthed an album containing small prints made in the years 1930-32. There were very few snapshots. There were some composed portraits of Sonia. They show a woman, well dressed but somber, deeply intro spective, whose eyes avoid the photographer. Others reveal Sonia's beauty in the nude. The rest of the prints are tightly composed pic tures, somber in mood. Their structure is rigid: carefully balanced forms, often precisely symmetrical in composition, occasionally cen trally organized with dark containing-areas on all four sides. The New York skyscraper was an important subject for Siskind at this time, but the pictures are neither snapshots nor documents of the architecture. They present strong, mysterious, sometimes ominous presences. They stress the phallic nature of the skyscrapers. The buildings are usually dark silhouettes against menacing skies (Illus. 3). One of the prints (The Daily News Building) was made by precisely centering the camera very low and tipping it up at an extreme angle, turning the strongly contrasting light and dark verti cals into a geometric abstraction of tense energy. Since all of these photographs were commercially-processed contact prints. Siskind 813</page><page sequence="7">Carl Chiarenza 4 Broadway Ballyhoo c. 1935 was working under severe handicaps. He had had absolutely no training, no contact with serious photography of any kind. He had no darkroom. What he would later do in the darkroom, in terms of tonal control, he did to the extent possible without access to dark room techniques. There are pictures of narrow empty streets with fa?ades of buildings on one side which on the one hand recall the nostalgic romanticism of the streets of Atget and on the other hand have a terrible sense of claustrophobia. These are strong state ments, they are very personal images. Structure and tonal arrange ments are of primary concern. They are not social documents, they do not speak of classes, the poor, the deprived. It is significant that Siskind mounted these pictures in an album manufactured to hold family snapshots, since it is the only album he ever owned. Others of these 21/8 x V/% inch prints further underline his earliest direction. Two of the prints, for example, are from the same nega tive. The "content" is a series of clotheslines stretched between buildings with a variety of hanging laundry. A dark coat, silhouetted and popping out of the picture plane, dominates the image. The second of the two prints was made by masking the negative so that the resulting print is l3/8 x 2lA inches. The negative was obviously made out of a window (probably in Siskind's apartment) which did not allow him to get close enough to compose the image as he wished, so he instructed the photofinisher to mask the tiny print to conform to the rectangle of related shapes, of lights and darks, that he had imagined. He was thinking formalistically and perhaps sym bolically.1 If the print also conveys overcrowded living conditions 814</page><page sequence="8">Early Work of Aaron Siskind (and that can be read into the image), it was not the dominant experience. There are a number of still lifes from this period. Some are overtly formal exercises (a picture of opposing lights and darks, created by a tight framing of the forms of a multitude of barrel hoops, swirling this way and that, as if trying to burst out of the confining rectangle). Others are engaging exercises in symbolism (a picture in which the composition is awkward at best, but which depicts a bell, an open book, a lamp that is lit, and a provocatively positioned pair of scissors; on the wall above this array is a framed D?rer print of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane). The latter photograph is clearly allegorical, an expression of Siskind's intense interest, at the time, in medieval literature, ritual and theology. The reference to "Bell, Book and Candle" is plain enough. A less mystical still life from the same period is composed of two lemons and a banana, arranged with direct reference to genitalia. There are a few other prints in this very early group in which the eroticism is more subtly, more mysteriously, if more dramatically, communicated. One frames two pairs of women's legs curiously interleaved in fan-like form; another fills the right foreground plane with the head and shoulders of a woman whose pained and ques tioning expression unsettles the viewer caught by her direct gaze. In the distant background of the latter, the viewer catches sight of two other women embracing languidly on a couch. The two prints appear to be part of a series or sequence. In mood they relate to a poem-play Siskind had written in 1926, which, from its title (A Masque. Upon a Triple Occasion in Honour of the Misses Sonia and Cora, and Master Aaron, for June 26, Their Day), was ob viously autobiographical. A brief section is quoted here as an example of the persistent mixture of metaphor, life experience (personal with general reference), and formal structure evident in all of Siskind's creative work. The following lines were spoken as a duet by two voices called "Virtue" and "Reward" (note the Judeo-Christian reference): We sought each other Sister, brother. Husband, lover, We sought each other And found us not about. We fled from meeting As from a plague; We had the ague And fled from meeting At last we found each other?out. 815</page><page sequence="9">Carl Chiarenza The range of the pictures from Siskind's first two years of inde pendent involvement with photography reflects closely the subjects and concerns that begin to find strong and consistent maturity a dozen years later. He was, in effect, making sketches during these first two years?sketches which would form the basis of a lifelong career of picture-making in which form and content are one and the same in functional terms. These photographs were the visual equiva lent of his early poetry and of his attempts at composing and play ing music. Though he was at this stage consciously unconvinced of photography's potential for art, he just as consciously tested it, quietly, privately, hesitantly. Two other pictures from 1930-32 ought to be mentioned. One is of a barren tree whose trunk splits into two limbs. The image is almost too obviously anthropomorphic. It is an important picture, for trees, either as isolated fragments or as anthropomorphic pairing of two or more trees interacting with one another?what he would call "Conversations"?are significant in his work throughout his career. The other of these tiny commercially-processed prints of major note is of a huge rock seemingly placed on a raised and groomed mound of earth. The totem quality, the sense of aura, are reminiscent of the great stones of England and Brittany. These and other early photo graphs prophesy the primitive anthropomorphism of Siskind's work in Gloucester in the mid-forties and the major pictures of fragments of stone fences on Martha's Vineyard from the early fifties and later. They also contain all the ingredients of the tragic images in Siskind's recent series on the trees of Corfu. These early sketches show that Siskind was not interested in the photograph as a means of transporting the viewer to an event, place, or thing. For him the photograph was a visual construction equivalent to the verbal construction of poetry and the sound con struction of music. His purpose was "to find a relation between an aesthetic and an idea." Not unlike the medieval poets he admired, he was interested in universal questions: the meaning of life, god, and the way life was played out within his own perception and experi ence. He had to rely on allusion, on symbol and metaphor, on the relations of shapes and of lights and darks, with which he would orchestrate the drama of his life's emotions from the lyrical to the violent. In 1932, three years after the marriage and two years after the honeymoon and first pictures, Siskind purchased a better camera (a 9x12 cm. Voigtlander Avis). In that year he joined the Film and Photo League. Siskind had reached a stage in his solitary explora 816</page><page sequence="10">Early Work of Aaron Siskind tion of photography where he was aware of his own accomplish ment, the limitations of his equipment, and the limits of his knowl edge. Though details of the origin of the Film and Photo League in 1930 are obscure, its founding is similar to that of other artists' and writers' groups at the time, which had formal or informal connec tions with the Communist Party. It is certain that members of the League were committed to making pictures and films which carried the message of social reform, images which focused on the facts of poverty, illiteracy, and discrimination. Why did Siskind, who had abandoned political involvement at the end of his high school years, join an activist group like the Film and Photo League? For one thing, he needed a group of people with whom he could talk and share ideas. Then, too, he had made a number of photographs of the disinherited and was certainly aware of the wretched social conditions born of the Depression. His own photography was at a critical point: quite simply, he needed technical advice. And finally, ever since his youth, he had needed a place away from the problems at home. All of these needs were addressed when, walking down a New York street, Siskind noticed and was moved by a display of photographs in the windows of the League's headquarters. He went in and began to talk to a few older men who reminded him of the people to whom he had been attracted as a teen-aged Socialist. Several of the men at the League befriended him and gave him the advice he needed to set up a darkroom of his own. By 1933 he had obtained enough knowl edge to build an enlarger and had mastered the necessary tech nology of the medium to be able to function with more concentra tion on the picture. In a number of ways the League was Siskind's avenue of entry into the photographic world. In 1932, soon after Siskind joined the League, he attended a spe cial meeting at which there were many people he had not seen be fore. One of the members, Izzie Lerner, who had recently returned from a trip to the USSR, had been accused of being critical of con ditions in Russia. He was "tried" at the meeting, found guilty of being an enemy of the working class, expelled from the League and blackballed from further contact with members. This had a lasting effect on Siskind, who could hardly have failed to see the similarity to his own "trial" for speaking ill of the treatment received by the Socialists and working class just prior to his graduation from high school. Later, as chairman of the League's exhibition committee, Siskind found that he was expected to meet with a Communist Party "functionary" to plan what pictures should be made and which should be included in exhibitions. He discovered that the "party 817</page><page sequence="11">Carl Chiarenza line," and therefore the kinds of photographs requested, would change according to the international situation. This doctrinaire ap proach disturbed him and led to his resignation from the League in 1935. During those three years Siskind's feelings were in conflict.2 He was upset about the "trial" and the authoritarian attitude of the party line, yet he worked hard for the exhibition committee. He be lieved in civil rights and social reform, and he made pictures for the cause. Siskind's pictures of the May Day Parade of 1932 were included in the League exhibition "America Today," which was produced in his first year of membership. Though interest in learning more about the medium was certainly a major factor in his decision to stay, it is difficult to see that as the only reason. In 1936 Sid Grossman persuaded Siskind to rejoin. In that year the film group split off and the remaining members were reorganized as the Photo League under the direction of Grossman and Sol Libsohn. Soon after his return, Siskind gathered a handful of serious amateurs and formed the "Feature Group" which became the elite corps of the Photo League for the rest of the decade. From 1936 to 1940, as founder, teacher, leader and working mem ber of the "Feature Group," he would thoroughly explore, master and reject the documentary photo essay which we associate with the work of the federally-funded Farm Security Agency photog raphers who were working at the same time. The Feature Group had no funding; and, as was true of the League in general, its mem bers were motivated by the appalling effects of the Depression on the lower strata of society in the major urban center of the world, New York City. Their work circulated largely through newspapers, magazines, and exhibition spaces underwritten by the Communist Party, labor unions and other liberal or radical groups friendly to the cause of reform. The work is only now beginning to be seen as important both socially and photographically to an understanding of the period.3 The group focused its attention on gaining total command of the medium while actively producing photo essays which would expose the conditions of the many disenfranchised citizens of New York. Siskind's personal conflicts continued. As he learned, and taught, more about the medium, he grew to be less convinced of the effec tiveness of "documenting" the surface ills of society. This is most evident in the work he did independently of his League involvement, but is clear even in his work for the League. The League itself changed and fluctuated during Siskind's second period. There was less overt political activity. Policy was no longer controlled by the Party. The membership expanded to include people of a variety of political persuasions. Most, however, were still com 818</page><page sequence="12">Early Work of Aaron Siskind mitted to social reform. Pictures, including those produced by the Feature Group, continued to appear in the Daily and Sunday Worker, and in other Communist-sponsored publications. Siskind himself contributed to these publications and continued to work on exhibitions for workers' unions and schools. Of course, there were numerous political, ideological, aesthetic, and personal factions. The Feature Group was not immune. By 1936 Siskind was thinking of ways to make pictures which would reveal the cause rather than the symptoms of social injustice. At the same time he continued to seek the limits of the expressive potential of photography as a medium. In the June-July 1940 issue of Photo Notes (the Photo League's newsletter), Siskind published a review of the Feature Group's evolution. In it he said: Instead of beginning with a study of critical statements on documentary photography by eminent moderns (Strand, for instance) and a review of its tradition (the procedure of Grossman's course . . .) we concern ourselves with the problem of how an idea comes to life in a photograph, and the special characteristics of that life. We start with the simplest ideas . . . The simplest ideas, because in examining the work we have done we can more easily relate the ideas to the elements of the picture and its total impact, and perhaps, in that way we can come to an agreement as to how and why it works?or doesn't. Perhaps the most revealing section of that essay was this formalist statement: We learned a number of things about the form and con tinuity of a picture-story; but mostly, we came to see that the literal representation of a fact (or idea) can signify less than the fact or idea itself (is altogether dull), that a picture or a series of pictures must be informed with such things as order, rhythm, emphasis, etc.?qualities which result from the perception and feeling of the photog rapher, and are not necessarily (or apparently) the prop erty of the subject. It is significant that the moment when Siskind made his decision to commit himself to photography was during a talk about the rela tionship between photography and the workingman given by Paul 819</page><page sequence="13">Carl Chiarenza Strand at the League in 1934. Siskind has never been able to rec oncile Strand's political stance (in word and picture) regarding the workingman, with his production of small, meticulous prints, carefully matted within thin wooden frames, priced so high that only the wealthy could afford them. While Siskind felt Strand's message was self-contradictory, he was moved by Strand's presence and passionate commitment to the medium. Strand's early flirtation with abstraction and the effect which that had on his later work is well known. Siskind's position, in terms of a political-aesthetic con flict, was not without similar characteristics at the time, though his presentation of work was at polar extremes to Strand's. So, by the mid-to-late 1930s, Siskind found himself in an ambiva lent position. He was growing more and more aware of the visual art world while he was deeply involved with the world of the social reformer. He was making photographs which can be called social realist, pictures which emphasized an immediately recognizable visual message. Yet he never let go of his interest in joining meta phor, structure, and form. Even within the most "documentary" of his Photo League series there are outstanding examples of the recog nizable overshadowed by metaphor built of symbol and form. Political dogma and the reformers' simplistic solutions to symptomatic in justice wore thin on Siskind. The Depression's effect on New York City, the growing threat of international war, and Siskind's own deteriorating marriage must have merged in his mind. Not unlike many of the major American painters of the time, Siskind turned more and more inward (as he had in his poetry of the 1920s, and in his first photographs of 1930-32). Siskind in the 1930s wanted to do the "right" thing at home, at school, and in the world. The "right" thing, however, seemed more and more futile, misguided, perhaps not right at all, and personally destructive as well. As the decade wore on, Siskind resorted to searching himself as a source of insight into the human condition. What he found were conflicts, dualities, myths in opposition to realities. And these became the form and content of his best work. One needs, of course, to study the whole of Siskind's work from this period in order to see the consistency with which the important pictures lead to the breakthrough of 1943-45. Here we are restricted to a very few examples. Illus. 1 and 4 are from the series Broadway Ballyhoo, made c. 1935, ostensibly to show the vulgarity of the Broadway scene. Illus. 1 (and others from this and sub-series, of various people conversing before signs or billboards) may be the source of the important Siskind genre which he calls "Conversa 820</page><page sequence="14">Early Work of Aaron Siskind tions." These "Conversations," which proliferated in the late 1940s (Illus. 2) and continue to the present, are generally considered abstract works in which form is dominant, metaphor is implied, and the source material is often a torn billboard. Siskind's interest, then and now, is in the revealing visual gestures, the visual closeness or separation, the visual evidence of human relationships. Illus. 4 (also one of a sub-series) can be, as is often the case, read in a number of ways: it tells of the Broadway scene, of the trials of the handicapped, of the loneliness of individuals, of the concern of some for others. All of these interpretations are expressed as much by the shapes and tones, their contrasts and their carefully con structed relationships, as by the recognizable content. Illus. 5 is from a series on the May Day Parade of 1936. Note how little it tells us of the significance of the day or of the parade. It is in great contrast to the pictures Siskind made of the May Day Parade of 1932. In those he conveyed the specific messages of the parade. Indeed, many of them simply recorded the signs being carried by marchers. In Illus. 5, however, the form and content are powerfully blended into a message which is generalized and metaphorical. Note also the structural resemblance to Illus. 4, and, more importantly to Illus. 6 of 1944. The more Siskind penetrated form in pictures, the more he con sciously worked toward the incorporation of symbol. We have seen his very early interest in the Christian theme. The crucifixion, im 821</page><page sequence="15">Carl Chiarenza 7 The Catholic Worker Movement: 8 from Tabernacle City 1932-40 St. Joseph's House c. 1939-40 portant in all periods of Siskind's career, plays a primary role in works of the Photo League period, such as the 1937 picture of the monument to Father Francis Patrick Duffy. Siskind photographed the monument before its unveiling so the figure of Duffy is wrapped and tied like a corpse before the stone cross. The crucifix appears in pictures from the Portrait of a Tenement series of 1936, in the series, The Catholic Worker Movement: St. Joseph's House of 1939-40, and in the series, Dead End, The Bowery of 1937-38. One example, Illus. 7, demonstrates the direct symbolic use of the cross as well as the abstract nature of the overall design of the rectangle, all of which was planned to relate metaphorically to a Biblical phrase. More familiar from this period are the numerous photographs in various important series (particularly of Broadway, the Bowery, and Harlem) which focus on painted and printed signs and billboards. There is no need here to detail Siskind's ongoing interest in the markings man leaves on walls and signs, and which he pointedly refers to as "the writing on the wall." Many of these early "mark ings" pictures (especially those in the Broadway and Bowery series) have the flatness and sense of collage more frequently associated with the later work. The most personal work of this period?that is, work done outside 822</page><page sequence="16">Early Work of Aaron Siskind of the Photo League?is largely architectural. There are three major series: Tabernacle City, 1932-40; Bucks County Architecture, 1935; and End of the Civic Repertory Theatre, 1938. It is significant, I think, that two of these series, Tabernacle City and End of the Civic Repertory Theatre, were exhibited at the Photo League and that in both instances they were poorly received. The former was condemned for not representing the worker's cause, the latter because the prints were "too dark." Both cases underline the growing antagonism between Siskind and the Photo League. Photo Leaguers were most interested in the political use (propaganda value) of photographs. Siskind was becoming most interested in pictures as expansive ob jects of formal and metaphorical contemplation. This is not to deny Siskind's genuine interest in the direct informational use of photog raphy, most evident in the Bucks County series, nor his genuine interest in pictorial propaganda for social reform which is evident in the monumental Harlem Document project. Indeed, he was test ing one kind of picture against the other in this period. His abandonment of the propaganda picture was most closely related to his disillusion with the motivation of so-called reformers and with the effectiveness of the photograph as a means of activating reform. Though he still maintains respect for informational photo graphs, particularly in the case of architecture, he no longer produces them. In this period, however, the documentation of architecture served a variety of purposes: historical record (the primary purpose of the Bucks County series, which in its largely passive approach is the least effective in terms of its identity with Siskind);4 exploration of form as structural order and as expressive of metaphorical meaning (Tabernacle City explores correspondence between architectural form and religious practice); and transformative possibilities (Civic Repertory Theatre reaches far beyond the general uses of the docu mentary and becomes a powerfully charged visual experience of decay and destruction which can be read generally or personally). Recall the importance of architecture as source material in the 1930 32 photographs and note the consistent use of architectural forms and fragments throughout Siskind's career. It is obvious that the geometry of most architecture (with or without organic decor) directly served Siskind's interest in positioning formal elements within the frame of the camera's ground glass. In other words, archi tecture was an opportune "subject matter" for the student interested in exploring the formal potential of the photographic medium. It follows that Siskind would use a tripod and a relatively large-format camera so that he would have optimum control over the composition of the negative. 823</page><page sequence="17">Carl Chiarenza What Siskind calls Tabernacle City was actually a Methodist re treat community known as Cottage City on Martha's Vineyard. It consisted of numerous small cabins which were constructed around a large simple central tabernacle. Most of the cabins are individually and ornately decorated in the gingerbread manner. Thus the archi tecture symbolizes the idea and activity of the retreat: communal sharing and individual meditation. For Siskind, who has made an annual retreat to the Vineyard for most of his adult life, this com munity must have seemed an expression of his own lifestyle. What attracted Siskind to this architecture, then, was again the melding of form and content. He researched the origin and develop ment of the community?its people, its architecture, and the meaning of their annual retreat. He was originally drawn, however, to the shapes and ornamentation of the buildings, particularly the framing of the windows and the design of the ornamentation. He was taken, again and again, by the relationship of forms within isolated frag ments of the cabins (Illus. 8 and 9). Very often there is in these semi-abstractions a suggestion of a "conversation" (often with sexual implications) between masculine and feminine shapes (Illus. 8).5 And this too is characteristic, is an aspect which is developed in more sophisticated ways in later work. Compare for example Illus. 8 with Illus. 10 and 11, from 1947-48 and 1967 respectively. Perhaps the most prophetic of the architectural series of this period was the End of the Civic Repertory Theatre, photographed in 824</page><page sequence="18">Early Work of Aaron Siskind 1938. When the prints exhibited at the Photo League were criticized as "too dark," Siskind's response was that he was interested in showing how decay breeds more decay and death. That Sonia was permanently hospitalized in 1938 is very likely of significance in the making of these pictures. The photographs seem to be about more than the destruction of a venerable theatre build ing. They may refer to the decay of a culture, the death of a tradi tion, even of a civilization. That would not have been an unusual theme in the America of the 1930s. A number of photographs which depict broken classical columns or classical heads can be read as metaphors for such ideas. All show age, wear, and a general fatigue of materials. Many flatten space, use deep, somber, moody tonali ties, and become literally abstractions which are heavy with the emotion of despair (Illus. 12). It is difficult not to see in these photo graphs Siskind's examination of his personal situation. There are, too, photographs which symbolically depict the male/ female polarity; others imply the more generalized polarities of light and dark, angular and curvilinear (Illus. 13); still others suggest the ancient "writing on the wall." All are beautiful prints which display the most sensual of photographic tones. These, then, may be the most personal photographs of the Photo League period; they are, in photographic terms, most like Siskind's mature work. 825</page><page sequence="19">Carl Chiarenza 13 End of the Civic Repertory Theatre 1938 Following Sonia's hospitalization, in 1938, Siskind underwent what we might today call a mid-life crisis. In 1940, he and Max Yavno, a Photo League photographer, rented two floors on Fourth Avenue and Eleventh Street, over the Corner Book Shop. Both men had re cently separated from their wives. About these years, roughly 1939 1942, Siskind has said: "I had to get used to life again. Not having been able to make love for so many years, suddenly I was like an adolescent. . . ." This bohemian period was a time of confusion and ambivalence. It was a critical time for Siskind's friends, and for his country, as well. In 1941 Siskind quit the League in response to criticism of the Tabernacle City exhibition. The political scene was confused; the party lines kept changing with the changing international scene. Siskind's own ambivalence over this is underlined by his attempt, in 1941, at the age of 37, to enlist in the Army's Officer Candidate School. He had been a pacifist all his life. He failed the written test and did poorly in the personal interview. These years were very lean photographically. The pictures he made are generally aesthetically insignificant but personally poignant. They revert to an intimate symbolism, usually sexual (Illus. 14), often simply suggesting a general impotence and frustra tion (Illus. 15). All, however, are definitely a move away from the 14 UNTITLED c. 1940-42 826</page><page sequence="20">Early Work of Aaron Siskind 15 UNTITLED c. 1940-42 informational photographs of the Photo League, the Farm Security Administration, and Life magazine. They are in no sense social docu mentation. By 1943 Siskind had moved to Ninth Street, east of University Place in Greenwich Village, where he would live until 1951. He renewed old friendships with Barnett Newman and Adolph Gottlieb, often summering with them on Martha's Vineyard or in Gloucester. In 1942 he met Ethel Jones, a young woman with whom he developed a seri ous and stable relationship of four or five years. Photography became even more important to him: he photographed every day during the summer, and printed during the school year. Though Siskind had seen few art exhibitions in the 1930s?the first contemporary painting exhibition he saw was "The Ten Whitney Dissenters" in 1938, an exhibition which included Gottlieb and Rothko?now he began to visit shows regularly. He and Ethel visited Peggy Guggenheim's Art of This Century Gallery in 1942. They also met Mark Rothko in 1943 and became close friends: Rothko eventually married Ethel's closest friend. The four summered together in 1945, after Rothko's first major one-man exhibition at the Art of This Century. From 1945 on Siskind was a regular at the gatherings of artists at the Waldorf Cafeteria on Sixth Avenue and Eighth Street, and at the Cedar Bar. In 1944 Siskind photographed the pre Columbian sculpture selected by Barnett Newman for exhibition at Betty Parson's Wakefield Gallery. In 1943 and 1944 a good part of Sis 827</page><page sequence="21">Carl Chiarenza kind's summer was spent with either Newman or Gottlieb or both. Siskind was now back in an ambience that resembled that of his college years more than that of the Photo League years. In 1943 Newman was so excited by Siskind's new pictures that he brought Gottlieb over specifically to see them. It was a period when Gottlieb and Rothko, as well as other Ameri can painters, were going through similar reappraisals of their work. Siskind's view of his and other artists' crises of the period is: It had to do with the concept of what art is and what it's for. And ours?we were all reacting very violently to what, during the thirties, was a very strong and dominating slogan: that art was a weapon of the working class?that it was something to use ... a political arm . . . We were all disillu sioned with that because we found that the very substance of art was corrupted by that attitude. So there was a with drawal into the personal and a reexamination of the person in relation to the world. This was often a topic of discussion among the New York artists of the 1940s. Most of them had had experiences with the Artists Union, the Artists Congress and the WPA Art Project which paralleled those Siskind had had with the Photo League. There was a general dis illusion with social reform methods and particularly with the use of art in that connection. Most, too, were of similar backgrounds and ages. Gottlieb, Rothko and Siskind were born in 1903, Newman in 1905. Siskind's evolution parallels that of the major painters of the period. In 1969, Thomas B. Hess wrote of the Abstract Expressionists that "Instead of formulating a program for overthrowing the state, which had been at the heart of the earlier avant-garde thinking, they resolved to topple the government inside themselves." {Barnett Newman, New York, 1969, p. 31) The change was a conscious one for most of the artists. Mark Rothko changed his name to underscore the break which he later described as going back to "symbols of man's primitive fears and motivations . . . changing only in detail but never in substance . . . And modern psychology finds them persisting still in our dreams, our vernacular and our art, for all the changes in the outward conditions of life." (Quoted in: M. Tuchman, ed., New York School, L.A. County Museum of Art, 1965, p. 29.) Reactions to paintings by Gottlieb and Rothko exhibited at the Wildenstein Gallery in 1943 were not unlike those to Siskind's Taber 828</page><page sequence="22">Early Work of Aaron Siskind nacle City exhibition at the Photo League in 1941. In response, Gottlieb and Rothko (with Newman's help) wrote a manifesto-letter to The New York Times which was published on June 13, 1943. Among the aesthetic beliefs they itemized was this: that the only subject matter that was valid was one which was "tragic and time less." Consequently . . . our work . . . must insult anyone who is spiritually attuned to interior decoration; pictures for the home, pictures for over the mantel; pictures for the American scene; social pictures; purity in art; prize winning pot-boilers; the National Academy .... During an informal (taped) discussion with students at the Rhode Island School of Design in 1969, Siskind spoke of the "subject matter" of his work from the mid-1940s: When I found that [the pictures] were all organized the same way?though I was unaware of that when I made them?with organic shapes playing against geometric set tings, it seemed very significant to me. The meaning of these pictures for me was that I was playing a game with the two forces of life; and I saw that it was the whole con cept of Western civilization?the whole business of good and evil, matter and spirit, society and the individual, feeling and mind, and so forth. I realized that these were the things I had struggled with when I was writing poetry. He went on to link the notion of this kind of duality to the Christian religion and Western culture. He called it "our problem," which he said was best expressed by photography, the "absolutely ideal me dium" for the purpose, Because we're tied, in photography, to reality . . . and at the same time we're trying to do something about this reality ... so in our pictures there's always this conflict . . . between the thing that's there and what we're trying to say about it. In the summer of 1943 Siskind roamed the beaches of Martha's Vineyard. He photographed every morning, but without a feeling of accomplishment. He picked up objects, collected them, placed them in new situations which he photographed. In this way he fell on the 829</page><page sequence="23">Carl Chiarenza idea of the flat plane (by placing the camera parallel to the field he had created) and the elimination of the perspectival illusion of pic tured spatial reality. Much of the work of this period resembles collage, both in terms of the constructed surface image and the ten sion between ordered but conflicting symbol-shapes. In 1955, he referred to this work and said it showed "order with the tensions continuing." ("The Essential Photographic Act," Art News, Vol. 54, No. 8, 1955, p. 36) More recently Siskind recalled a late 1940s dis cussion with a group of New York painters, including Rothko, New man, and Motherwell, at which he talked about his 1943-44 ex perience: The thing that was driving me was a need for order. I felt so completely disturbed ... so many conflicting forces were working within me, that the pleasure I got from making a picture, and the thing that was driving me to make the picture, was that that was the only way I could organize, could get a sense of order and relaxation. Therefore the object of the picture was something to con template?right from the beginning. It was the only sure way that I could remove myself from the battle and work in a kind of [confident] fashion. The source material for the photographs of 1943-45 generally consisted of objects or substances (usually man-made) which were decaying, destroyed, or mutilated. Almost always the resulting pic tures transformed these things anthropomorphically. The world of these pictures is ambiguous. Scale and space fluctuate: large/small, flat/deep. They are people with dismembered and headless bodies, ghosts and monsters without material substance. Other configura tions suggest monk's clothes, the crucifixion, totemic or primitive icons, and ritual events. The mood is heavy, somber, cast in a low key with a preponderance of rich, deep greys and blacks. But it is all contained, controlled. Illus. 16 is an example from the period which Siskind seems to have considered important since it was reproduced often on exhibition announcements and in such publications as Art Photography (June, 1954) where it was captioned: "the blank eye, the hard profile, in a time of violence." The primary image is of a menacing mask which sears the photographic paper. The stark contrasts of light and dark are violent and the circular eye is hypnotic. Most of the pictures of the period oppose organic and geometric elements. These oppositions range from simple "conversations" to such obviously symbolic sug gestions as the male/female polarity. 830</page><page sequence="24">Early Work of Aaron Siskind 17 Gloucester No. 28 1944 Illus. 17 is one of the boldest, most powerful statements of the prolific year 1944. It can be seen as a "conversation," a weeping Magdalen at the foot of the crucifixion, as an isolation of the sexes, and so on. The rectangle is tension-filled but contained by a rigidly ordered construction. The flat plane is emphasized by the deep black field upon or in which the antagonistic figures gesticulate. One feels a great impending violence which is momentarily stilled by the formal placement of shapes. Many of these pictures anticipate the later configurations of some of the Abstract Expressionist painters. One example, Illus. 18, must suffice to make the point here. The great clashing black forms on a white field suggest the later work of Franz Kline, who would a few years later become one of Siskind's closest friends and whose first one-man show would take place in 1950, three years after Siskind's first exhibition at the same gallery.6 That Siskind was aware of his breakthrough is made clear by the text of an essay which he wrote in the winter of 1944 and which was published in Minicam Photography (Vol. 8, No. 9) in June, 1945. After a lengthy discussion of his working habits, which he summed up as an "utterly personal" and "emotional" experience, he went on to say that . . . the picture that emerges is unique . . . the picture?and this is fundamental?has the unity of an organism. . . . 831</page><page sequence="25">Carl Chiarenza Pressed for the meaning of these pictures, I should answer, obliquely, that they are informed with animism? not so much that these inanimate objects resemble the creatures of the animal world . . . but rather that they suggest the energy we usually associate with them. Aesthetically, they pretend to the resolution of these some times fierce, sometimes gentle, but always conflicting forces. . . . the potent fact is not any particular object; but rather that the meaning of these objects exists only in their relationship with other objects, or in their isolation (which comes to the same thing, for what we feel most about an isolated object is that it has been deprived of relationship). These photographs appear to be a representation of a deep need for order. Time and again "live" forms play their little part against a backdrop of strict rectangular space?a flat, unyielding space. They cannot escape back into the depth of perspective. The four edges of the rec tangle are absolute bounds . . . Essentially, then, these photographs are psychological in character. [That] may or may not be a good thing. But it does seem to me that this kind of picture satisfies a need. I may be wrong, but the essentially illustrative nature of most documentary photography, and the worship of the object per se, in our best nature photography, is not enough to satisfy the man of today, compounded as he is of Christ, Freud, and Marx. The interior drama is the meaning of the exterior event. And each man is an essence and a symbol. Siskind, therefore, did not exchange content for form in 1943. Nor did his work make the polar change usually associated with that period. What happened in the development of Siskind's photography is complicated. It is surely not explained in this essay. What we have shown, however, are three important factors: Siskind's creative production is intimately tied to his development as a person in New York City at a certain time and under certain circumstances. The essential elements of his photography were fully developed in his poetry of the 1920s. His involvement with what has been called con tent-oriented documentary photography in the 1930s was the result of complex factors stemming from his early life under immigrant and tenement conditions, the Socialist involvement of his teen years, his resulting high school conflict, his genuine interest in social justice and 832</page><page sequence="26">Early Work of Aaron Siskind civil rights, the psychological strain of his marriage and home life, his desire for knowledge and experience with a new medium, and his need for a supportive group and ambience. Though the Photo League work may have delayed the evolution of Siskind's mature work, it also gave him an ideal opportunity to ex plore the "conflict of form and content" in a direct way for himself and for those members of the Feature Group who worked so closely with him. Indeed, the reason Siskind's pictures from this period, particularly the well-known work for Harlem Document and The Most Crowded Block in the World, are still so powerful is his in sistence on the pictorial sense and structure of each photograph no matter what its ultimate purpose. What is important to the success of Siskind's pictures is visual coherence (or visual meaning). His particular visual coherence is the result of the oneness of form and content?that is, the positioning of all elements into a meaningful whole which can be felt visually to be complete and to be continually intra-referential, even if it cannot be translated or articulated verbally. NOTES 1 See the related and somewhat similar photograph {Rome No. 13, 1963) made 33 years later. 2 Concerning his feelings about Photo League politics when he first joined, Sis kind said: "I went in there, I met up with it, I had to deal with it; but it was a kind of self-punishment because I always felt ill-at-ease. ... By that time, everyone I met who talked politics to me immediately put me on guard. I looked at him and instead of hearing what he was saying, I was listening for his motivations, seeing his character. I was involved, not in what he was saying, but in how he was saying it, and wondering why he was saying it." This and all other quotations from Siskind are from taped interviews with the author over the last seven years, unless otherwise indicated. 3 See Anne Tucker, "Photographic Crossroads: The Photo League," Journal, No. 25 (April 6, 1978), The National Gallery of Canada (Ottawa) and her forthcoming book of the same title to be published by Knopf. 4 See C.
