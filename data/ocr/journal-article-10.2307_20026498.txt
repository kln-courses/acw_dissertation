<plain_text><page sequence="1">World Interpretation and Self Interpretation: Some Basic Patterns Ernst Topitsch The enormously varied conceptions and postulates by which human beings have tried to understand their environment and them selves have not lent themselves either to classification in accordance with a single principle, or to a derivation from a single principle. Nevertheless, a group of thought models has emerged. And, although it can in no way claim exclusiveness, it has played an important part in the development of mythology as well as of philosophy. The examination of these models in this essay may be useful toward a better understanding of the methods by which we look for an interpretation of the world and of ourselves, as well as toward the elimination of numerous pseudo problems that still exist in tradi tional philosophy as remnants of prescientific thought patterns. I Man for the most part conceives of what is remote, unknown, or difficult to understand in terms of what is near, well known, and self-evident. As a rule, this is the significant factor in practical life as well as in anything that is emotionally effective.1 That is to say, it is the most striking and impressive vital, social, and artistic processes and productions that most often serve as explanations by analogy for the universe as a system. Thus the world may appear as a social structure, a family, a clan, or a state ruled by a king and ordered in accordance with a law. Or it may be manifested as a work of art, a building, or a city; or as a divine musical instrument resounding in the harmony of the spheres. These and similar con ceptions play an important part in mythology, and especially in the astral myths of the great cultures of antiquity, from Egypt to China. Furthermore, they may be found to be still prevalent today among</page><page sequence="2">World Interpretation 313 primitive races. Here the phylogenetic and ontogenetic findings agree. For example, in his psychology of development, Jean Piaget has shown that the child also conceives of the world as existing in analogical relation to his wishes and actions, his social connections, and his handhng of things in general. Not only are certain conceptual images from the domain of social and productive action projected outward into the universe, but also the cosmos itself in this anthropomorphic interpretation may be retrojected into its original image, that of human action. The ter restrial state and terrestrial law must be assimilated to, or modeled upon, the cosmic state and law; the human ruler is the image, the son or deputy of the divine ruler of the world. Places of worship and cities are built according to the model of the supposed "world edifice" or 'heavenly city," and music should be an echo of "the harmony of the spheres." Such conceptions were developed in the major cultures of the ancient East to become a mythology of great power and influence; in the Hellenistic age they fused with Greek thought; and they had their repercussions in Europe far on into the New Era. The concep tion of the ecclesiastical edifice as an image of the "Heavenly Jerusalem" or even of the cosmos was still familiar to the architects of the Gothic period and the Renaissance, so that an unbroken tradi tion leads from the Solar Kingdom of Egypt to that of Louis XIV. Moreover, astrology (which for thousands of years, far from being mere superstition, was a conception of the world equal in rank to philosophy) was founded on the same process of projecting condi tions of immediate earthly reality into the cosmos (as in the naming of the stars), and then of retrojecting the "macrocosmos" so inter preted into the "microcosmos" of human existence. Whether the original doctrines of Greek philosophy were influenced by Oriental myths of this kind is not certain; but it is definitely established that the pre-Socratics employed these same models in forming their conception of the world. Thus the world is taken to be a state, similar to the Greek polis, or a well-organized farm, or an edifice designed in conformity with definite aesthetic principles. The atomistic system of Demokritos may have originated in technological conceptions?above all, those concerning the behavior and divisibility of matter?as well as the simple truth exemplified in architecture, namely, that out of the same stones various buildings can be con structed, one after another.</page><page sequence="3">314 Ernst Topitsch The analogies borrowed from artistic creation were significant to both Plato and Aristotle, as many scientific investigators have realized. The Idea must not be regarded as a universal concept of neutral value, but as a paradigm, as a representative work project, which should imply a correspondence, just as a work of art corresponds to the artist's plan. The Aristotelian dual concepts of form and matter, of potency and act, are likewise borrowed from artistic production. Above all, the interpretation of causality (the doctrine of four causes ) was based on the process followed in creative hand craft, by which the master produced (efficit) a work according to a form (forma) planned by him for a definite purpose (finis) out of a given material (materia). Aristotle used these models and con cepts not only in the realm of organic nature but also in the theory of knowledge and, to a certain extent, in logic. Thus the Aristotelian distinction between a passive, receptive intel lect and an active, form-giving one (later called respectively nous pathetikos and nous poietikos) presupposes the technomorphic model of the formation of a material. Thomas Aquinas makes this distinc tion: by the ability to work on the part of the active intellect (intellectus agens) and by the imparting of a form?represented by thought (species intelligibilis)?the workman (the human being, or the soul) creates the work (the idea) out of a material (the passive intellect, or intellectus possibilis). These conceptual models were still effective even in Kants writings. In recent times T. W. Adorno has indicated the importance of the work process to the foundations of Hegels metaphysics of knowledge.2 Still more striking than in these rather special considerations is the effectiveness of the analogies borrowed from production and the social order in the outlining of extensive world conceptions. The Stoics in particular created a world picture of this kind by fusing certain Platonic and Aristotelian traditions with corresponding forms in the Oriental mythology of antiquity. At least in its fundamental characteristics, it remained a conclusive one for Christianity: the universe is a single, powerful state, organized in accordance with a rational law, governed by a divine ruler whose authority determines all events down to the minutest detail and whose principle is that of true justice. In another interpretation, it is a work of art, designed and constructed by a superhuman master or foreman. The tendency to interpret the cosmos and the individual alike as a picture, so to speak, of the social or technological modes of human</page><page sequence="4">World Interpretation 315 behavior sometimes overlaps another tendency: the antitype of human hmitations and transitoriness, it gives rise to the idea of a perfect entity. This entity (the "Supreme Being" or however it may be termed), superior to all limitations such as the imperfections and frustrations typical of human existence, is above every form of will and activity, and ultimately even above man's thought. It cannot be defined by means of concepts or comprehended through the medium of language; that would be incompatible with its perfection. Furthermore, it is beyond any kind of contaminating relation to the empirical world. The adherents of this doctrine, however, do not acknowledge that it owes its conception to the antitype of this empirical world. These hypotheses have engendered a number of problems. If the structure of the universe, of universal nature, or of human nature is subject to a "law of order" superior to all positive statutes, of what does this law consist? Furthermore, if a just Power dominates the cosmos without restriction, how can we account for injustice, and still more for the apparent irrationality of values in the world process? And if this Power represents the cause of all events and consequently of all human will and activity, how can the human being be respon sible for his actions when in fact they are not his? Finally, if the divine entity transcends all human conception and is unrelated to the empirical world, how can one speak of it? What is its role in the exegesis of the world? Traditional metaphysics has for many centuries been occupied with such problems of natural law, with theodicy, with freedom of will and the analogia entis, yet it has never solved them. The reason is obvious as soon as the presuppositions are revealed. The first three problems are based on the projection of models, drawn from the domain of human activity, into the cosmos, and on their reflection from there onto this domain. If we abandon this typically pre scientific way of explaining the world, these problems also disappear ?the problem of freedom of will disappears in at least one of its numerous versions. The impossibility of solving the problem of the analogia entis may, in principle, be ascribed to the fact that the concept of the "most perfect entity" is founded on conceptions of perfection that contradict one another; and to the further fact that the postulate of perfection, of a being beyond human knowledge, comes into conflict with the desire for knowledge. The fact that these so-called eternal problems are pseudo</page><page sequence="5">316 Ernst Topttsch problems when seen from this point of view can be gathered from their history and from the methods used in dealing with them. For more than two millennia, a variety of socio-ethical and pohtical ideals and requirements, often in complete contradiction to one another, have been established under the title of "natural law," without any success in settling this "plurality of natural laws" or even any likelihood of settling them. This must be ascribed quite simply to the fact that any arbitrary ethico-pohtical postulate may be set forth as an expression of "universal law" or of 'human nature" and then may be deduced from the latter subsequently?a fact of which the pioneer advocates of the various doctrines of natural law were by no means conscious. If, finally, the doctrine of natural law involves tautologies and vicious circles, then the problem of theodicy (or cosmodicy) arises as a result of the presupposed contradiction existing between the assumption of the omnipotence of a just world principle (or one directed toward values of any sort) on the one hand, and on the other, the multiplicity of actual evils in the ordinary course of life. This unresolvable contradiction could be concealed only by modify ing or rejecting, as inconspicuously as possible, at least one of the incompatible hypotheses. Thus either the omnipotence of the divine principle became restricted, or, alternatively, the attempt was made to deny the existence of evil. Precarious methods were sometimes adopted by arguing thus: reality and values must in any case coincide, and if it is impossible to adapt reality to values, then values must be adapted to reality. The fact that the ensuing conflict between theodicy and ethics never broke out in full force must be ascribed to the circumstance that the former was for the most part restricted to a contemplative reconciliation with, or adjustment to, the inevitability of evil, while in daily life the customary rules of moral conduct were comphed with. Nevertheless, the divergence between practical ethics and a contemplative admiration of the cosmos (or of its ruler) has led to the most significant expression from the philosophical standpoint of the problem of the freedom of the will. On the one hand, the perfec tion and sublimity of the cosmocrator implied omnipotence and universal causality; on the other, the thesis that sin was also caused by the cosmocrator threatened the foundations of morahty. Here also the contradition was included in the premises, so that solution was impossible. It was necessary to be satisfied with the alternative</page><page sequence="6">World Interpretation 317 of making considerable concessions in respect to one or another of the postulates by way of illogical compromises. The case of the analogia entis (likewise unresolvable as a result of the contradiction in the premises ) was similarly dealt with. II Not only are thought patterns from the sphere of social production and reproduction in life projected into the cosmos, but they are also used in explaining the individual and are sometimes even introjected into the "soul"?if this expression of Freud's may be used in a some what different sense. Since a smaller number of facts that can be objectively tested exist in this domain as compared with the physical world, fantastic speculations are rendered possible. But it must be emphasized that behef in the soul has never represented a single consistent doctrine, but rather a reservoir containing extremely varied ideas, which could be systematized only with great difficulty by priest-thinkers and philosophers. Although originally conceptions of the soul were probably modeled only in part, if at all, on social events, even in prehistoric times such conceptions were strongly influenced by social conditions. This is shown by the behef in the survival of the personality after death. In many cases, the kinship of the clan continues beyond the grave.8 In so far as they are remembered, the deceased members, together with the living, constitute a unit with reciprocal rights and obligations. A deceased member of a family or clan is entitled to provisions and to deference on the part of the survivors. On the other hand, he can intervene in the fate of the living members, and above all, he can protect his clan in case of distress. The Greek cities had their protectors. In the German Middle Ages, when a settle ment was exposed to peril from pagan invasion, the dead were said to have risen and averted the calamity. The conception of the life to come as a continuation of earthly social order has been kept ahve in feudal and monarchical forms of society. The tombs of nobles and their rulers were provided with arms and servants, in order that even after death they might maintain a way of life consistent with their rank. If the Athenian democracy restricted pomp at the burial of nobles, the question was not merely one of "combating luxury," but rather of depriving the dead of the means of continuing a privileged existence in the world to come.</page><page sequence="7">318 Ernst Topitsch With many peoples, moreover, survival after death represented a privilege of the nobility : only they were endowed with an immortal soul, whereas ordinary people had nothing to which to look forward. Even commoner was the differentiation of fate in the life to come from the point of view of rank and dignity: the souls of the nobles and the rulers ascended to heaven, but those of ordinary human beings were permitted only to stagnate in shadowy Hades. Among the Egyptians, survival after death was exclusively a privilege of lords and rulers, that is, those who could secure residence and maintenance throughout eternity by means of costly tombs and their appurtenances; the poor were merely buried in the sand without any offerings. In Egypt, the intimate association between the pohtical system and a behef in the survival of the soul was additionally attested to by the fact that as soon as dignitaries received their appointments, they were honored by the long with the Ka, a special type of soul. In course of time this group of the privileged was expanded to include a wider range of social strata. As the "realm of the dead" took shape in conformity with the terrestrial state, the souls of common people were also allowed to enter the other world, in order that servants and administrative machinery should be at the disposition of rulers and officials even after death. China, the other great bureaucracy of the ancient world, also developed the idea of a "realm of the dead." The ruler of Hades had his staff of subordinates and servants, like a great terrestrial potentate, and officiated at a tribunal of justice by apportioning rewards or punishments to the deceased souls. Thus a government of "dead souls" developed as a pendant to that of the living. The idea of the "tribunal of the dead," one of the most important social elements of behef in the soul, had originally no meaning on the ethical plane. In Egypt, it was primarily the tribunal with which the dead menaced the violators of graves, and which ruled on whether the dead had been buried according to ritual, and also whether the deceased had performed his duties as dignitary. Only in course of time did the tribunal of the dead acquire a more and more pronounced moral character. The moralization of the conceptions of the hereafter did not always imply humanization. On the contrary: the penalties imposed by the tribunal of the next world were often based on the cruel jus talionis, on the desire for revenge on the part of persecuted rehgious communities that derived satisfaction from the assurance that in the next world their present persecutors would</page><page sequence="8">World Interpretation 319 suffer throughout eternity the agonies they had imposed on others. The behef in the transmigration of souls was also given a new moral interpretation. This behef arose from ethically neutral concep tions, such as the hereditary nature of vital energy or the reincarna tion of the dead in the newborn of their clan and?last but not least? the transmigration of the souls of the dead into animals and plants. Later on, this behef was invoked primarily to reconcile the apparent contradiction between the manifold injustices in earthly life on the one hand, and the idea of an equitable world order on the other. The disparity between merit and good fortune was explained as punishment for some offense committed in a previous existence, or else as the promise of compensation in a future reincarnation of the sufferer. Here, as elsewhere, the soul was an instrument of a function of society: the guilty subject, and the object of retaliation. In other respects, also, social thought patterns have been of importance to the development of ideas concerning the soul. Like the cosmos, the individual and his soul were interpreted in terms of the social hierarchy. The Pythagorean physician, Alkmaion of Kroton, conceived of human nature as analogous to the state; health was guaranteed by the equality of rights (isonomia) of the forces manifest in the body, whereas illness was caused by the autocracy (monarchia) of any one of these forces. In the writings of Demokritos (Fragm. B 34), both the individual and the cosmos represent cor responding social hierarchies. Finally, Plato outlined in detail the picture of the "soul state." For him (at least in the Republic and Timaios) the soul represented a hierarchical system consisting of the components of the soul, a system in which reason (logistikon) was supposed to rule over desire (epithymia), and the common people in the soul state, with the aid of a strong will (thymoeides), were similar to a pohce force (doryphoroi). If this order prevailed, then justice ruled. On the other hand, the revolt of the "lower spiritual forces" imphed civil war (stasis) in the soul?or, more simply, evil. This "social model of the soul" continued to be effective in the history of philosophy, from Aristotle to the Stoics and neo-Platonists, and it is still to be discerned in such an enlightened thinker as Freud. With him the superego appears, to control and tyrannize over the ego. The function of the latter is in many ways similar to that of an executive manager of a large firm: it compromises, harmo nizes, organizes, adapts, and encourages adaptation in other physical</page><page sequence="9">320 Ernst Topitsch domains. Furthermore, on the basis of examples derived from sociology, Freud shows that the extreme suppression of a minority of rebels effects the elimination not of the group itself but rather of its activities; this is more dangerous, since the activities are driven underground. As F. Hacker stated in a recent lecture, many funda mental concepts of psychoanalysis seem influenced by specifically Austrian social conditions: Where else does a censorship exist or has ever existed in which? although it is incorruptible and strict?everything can be arranged in accordance with a definite purpose, or a police force which controls the frontiers between the conscious and the unconscious, but which relaxes during the night so far as to facu?tate the smuggling of contraband goods ?whereby dreams arise? It is tempting, and indeed necessary, to analyze the explanatory power and function of such conceptions more exhaustively than has been done hitherto. As G. H. Mead has pointed out, the human self and our interpretation of self are socially influenced to a high degree. Ideological motives, however, also play a considerable part in these questions. Many of these conceptions are not only introjected into the "soul" from the domain of social relations, but the idea of the "soul state" thus reahzed reacts upon society just as in the case of the "cosmic state." Even the above-mentioned view of Alkmaion suggests that only the repubhc of nobles with its isonomia constitutes the "sane" and therefore the appropriate form of state, whereas monarchy represents a pathological and consequently an erroneous form. Plato makes this quite clear. He first places his ideal of the state in the "soul," then claims that the human state must correspond to the "soul state." Moreover, that ideology according to which the social order prevailing on this side of the grave is continued in the hereafter may react upon the social structure. But here the existing conditions are not always clear. This idea that a "compensatory justice" (or one that atones) prevails in the other world?as compared with the behef that the privileges of the ruling classes persist beyond death?may be a revolutionary one; but on the other hand, it may serve in this world to prevent subjugated peoples from resorting to revolutionary measures. Max Weber has shown convincingly that the Indian doc trine of the transmigration of souls was closely connected with the caste system and tended to preserve it</page><page sequence="10">World Interpretation 321 The impossibility of testing statements ncerning destiny in the next world led to the same result as did the empty formulae of "natural law." Up to a certain point, everyone could adapt these conceptions to his own desires and ends. The rich and powerful awaited a continuation of their seignorial existence, the poor and oppressed hoped for compensation for their misery, while the priests were certain they would dominate the great of this world and, in the meantime, forced the latter to make abundant gifts by threatening them with the torments of hell. The manifold forms of desire for aggression, revenge, and retaliation that could not be satisfied in this life found an outlet in the various conceptions of the next world. It is thus understandable that descriptions of hell in hterature are much more convincing than those of heavenly bliss. But the concept of the soul may be interpreted by technomorphic analogies: for instance, Aristotle represents it as forma corporis. Living beings, then, represent the products that result from a process of artistic handcraft, by which they are produced from a given material by virtue of a principle of form effective from within (the soul), and are dedicated to their own specific type of perfection. Thus we have here, above all, the question of a technomorphic explanation of certain definite uniformities in organic nature, such as morphogenesis and the continuity of species. Moral attitudes are, in the first place, as foreign to this "biological" theory as to the doc trine of the atomists, according to which the soul, based on the mechanical model, consists of material particles, possibly of extra ordinarily fine and mobile atoms of fire. Even when no "soul substance" is assumed, the psychical functions are often conceived of as analogous to the mechanics of medium-sized bodies. Concep tions of this kind were apphed particularly in the so-called psychology of association, but they are still traceable in psycho analysis, as, for instance, in Freud's theory of the drives, according to which the spiritual processes occasionally seem to take place in a manner similar to the mechanics of waterworks. Like the social, the technomorphic thought patterns have a certain value as heuristic principles, and also as a means of description and elucidation. On the other hand, they may be completely misleading. No less important than these analogistic conceptions of the soul, determined in part by the fundamental forms in which human beings come to practical terms with their environment, is another form that seeks its own ways of overcoming the pressure imposed by the</page><page sequence="11">322 Ernst Topitsch surrounding world: shamanism. It is not just by chance that this conception predominates in the Arctic, the region where human beings are most intensely affected and thwarted by environment.4 But in more southerly cultures the type of the ecstatic magician is likewise to be found, and it is undecided whether and to what extent there is any general connection with shamanism. In any case, it is true that in all these cases certain definite experiences of a superiority to the surrounding world occur, usually in the ecstatic state engen dered by appropriate drugs?hashish, mescaline, and the like?and also by means of rhythmic dances, a curtailment of respiration, and other such practices.5 In states of this kind, the human being experi ences the feehng of being independent of the limitations of space, time, and his own bodily existence. The resistance of the things he tries or fails to surmount is easily overcome. The harm caused by social conflicts, especially by feelings of guilt, suddenly disappears. Hopes and desires the realization of which would otherwise seem improbable attain fulfillment. In the last resort, the human being imbued with this euphoria feels himself superhuman, possessing divine power?even a god. Inasmuch as he beheves these ecstatic experiences to be real, the possessed man becomes convinced that he is capable of extraordinary achievements (and his fellow men are likewise so convinced ). The shaman possesses magic powers over his environment: he is able to heal the sick, to reveal secrets, and to avert misfortune and suffering; his soul, separating itself from his body, has access to the realm of the dead and to the kingdom of heaven, and can journey far and wide in any direction on this earth. Here again a process of fading, dwindling, and spiritualizing has more recently been at work. The outward and visible effects of ecstasy were renounced wherever behef in magical forces diminished, or where the magic that aimed at external effects was unnecessary, or where an aversion to humiliating and disillusioning consequences existed, or, finally, where the pressure of environment was so over whelming that to overcome it in the practical sense could no longer be expected. No longer was any attempt made to diminish the discord between individual desires and evaluations on the one hand, and the facts opposing the latter on the other, through the attempt to change facts by magic. Instead, the same end was sought by altering the individual spiritual state and emotional attitude to things. To quote Freud, the aims of these desires were transferred in such a way that they were no longer frustrated by reality.6</page><page sequence="12">World Interpretation 323 III Thus the idea developed that the soul, or at least its essence, is independent of and superior to its environment ( including the body ). It can be redeemed from its "imprisonment in matter" by various rites, and in the case of the more philosophical types of these myths, it suffices for redemption that the human being become aware of the divinity of his "true ego." A doctrine of the "higher soul" or "mind" emerges, by which the latter is fundamentally different from our empirical self, so closely entangled with our environment. The char acteristics of this "mind" are precisely defined by its superiority to the injuries that may threaten us from our own psychophysical organism, from nature, and from our fellow creatures. The "mind" is immortal, free from suffering, and devoid of guilt?in so far as it is detached from the contaminating contact with matter. This conception of the soul or ego has played an important part in the doctrines of the mystic and gnostic philosophers of India and the Occident. In addition to these social and technomorphic models of the soul, however, we also find the interpretation of the soul as an animating force, and finally the beginnings of a scientifically descriptive psychology. In many cases these various conceptions of the soul coexist in the doctrines of one and the same philosopher, who then makes use of whichever he needs in a particular context Even some of the greatest philosophers were not always aware of the ensuing contradictions. Here, only a few difficulties may be pointed out. Even social and technomorphic conceptions are often incom patible with one another. The soul as forma corporis is not the agent of conscious action, and for this reason it cannot be held accountable for conscious actions. Neither is it conceivable in the social role of the avenger or in that of the penitent. Indeed, this conception of the soul cannot render conceivable any form of continuity of the individ ual after death. The mechanical model of the soul, in the narrower sense, is always indifferent to morahty and repudiates survival after death. After the death of the body, the atoms of the soul are redis persed throughout the universe. Still more intense is the discord between social and mystical con ceptions. In mysticism the "true soul" is good; it is timeless, immate rial, and exempt from suffering. For this reason it cannot be imagined in the role of a representative of guilt and expiation. Its "freedom" consists in its state of redemption from the pressure of reality; its freedom is not that of the individual who decides between good</page><page sequence="13">324 Ernst Topitsch and evil and is held accountable for such decisions. Inasmuch as this soul is timeless, it cannot be subjected to the sequence of guilt and expiation. Because it is above all suffering, no punishment in the form of pain can b^ inflicted upon it. Indeed, the objection to an immaterial soul, in the strictest meaning of the term, is sometimes based on the fact that because it has no corporeal form, it cannot be punished. Quite other inferences were drawn from the behef that the "true ego" was above all guilt and misery, in so far as this doctrine, which originated in the domain of contemplative uplift, was apphed to that of practical activity. As a result of the behef that this "higher soul" could not in any way be sullied or defiled, the human being might commit any outrage whatsoever without either injuring his "true self' or running the risk of being punished in the next world. Moreover, because that self was unaffected even by torture and death, the human being might torment and kill his fellow men with out pangs of conscience?inasmuch as he did not cause them any real harm. Thus in certain cases these mystic doctrines were used to abrogate morahty, and Indian despots saw in them a welcome oppor tunity of justifying their acts of cruelty.7 These and kindred problems have exercised traditional philosophy ?or theology, which is in essence the same thing?for millennia. Under the protection of powerful institutions and by virtue of the manifold possibihties of formulation accessible to those institutions, metaphysical theories concerning the soul have exercised consider able influence almost to the present day. Even Kant's theory of the ego represents, in the final resort, an attempt to achieve a compro mise between mystic contemplative conception on the one hand, and the moral idea of the "true self" on the other. The "intelligible ego," which as the "thing in itself" is superior to the physical world, is defined in terms of the proposition that it is always striving for what is morally good. Thus a link between mysticism and morahty is forged?a link that, however, does not prove to be a firm one, since the intelligible ego is incapable of deciding between good and evil, and consequently cannot be the object of merit or culpability. It is only in our century that, as a result of the dwindling of behef in the soul and in immortality, interest in philosophical speculation in regard to the soul has diminished. This is perhaps the reason why it is possible only today to analyze the metaphysics of the cosmos and the soul in a scientific and truly objective manner.</page><page sequence="14">World Interpretation 325 REFERENCES 1.
