That the concept of literary character is a problem?or at least entails problems?I take as axiomatic. It was certainly so for L. C. Knights when, in 1933, he published his classic essay "How Many Children Had Lady Macbeth?"1 A brief for New Critical formalism, Knights's article also mounts an attack on the methods of character analysis that dominated earlier critical practice, as ex emplified by the study of Shakespeare: The habit of regarding Shakespeare's persons as "friends for life," or, maybe, "deceased acquaintances" is responsible for most of the vaga ries that serve as Shakespeare criticism.... It is responsible for all the irrelevant moral and realistic canons that have been applied to Shake speare's plays, for the sentimentalizing of his heroes (Coleridge and Goethe on Hamlet) and his heroines. And the loss is incalculable. (30) Knights's critique has produced a kind of queasy ambivalence in more recent literary criticism, which remains attached to the notion of character without really wanting to be; as Elizabeth Fowler summa rized matters in 2003, "Literary scholarship ... speaks of characters as if they were real people and, just as frequently, warns us that they are not" (5). The resulting dilemma receives fine comic expression at the hands of David Lodge, an author with credentials both as a theo rist and as a writer of fiction. In the 1988 academic novel Nice Work, Lodge 's narrator is awkwardly obliged to introduce a character who "doesn't herself believe in the concept of character'"?one "Robyn Penrose, Temporary Lecturer in English Literature at the University of Rummidge" (21). And Penrose's objections to the concept?"that character' is a bourgeois myth, an illusion created to reinforce the ideology of capitalism," obscuring the crucial insight that "[t]here are no selves, only production, and we produce our 'selves' in language" BRUCE BOEHRER's work in animal studies includes Shakespeare among the Animals (Palgrave, 2002), Parrot Culture (U of Penn sylvania P, 2004), and, as editor, A Cul tural History of Animals in the Renaissance (Berg, 2007). He teaches English at Florida State University. The present essay is an extract from his current book in progress, "Animal Characters: Nonhuman Beings in European Literature, 1400-1700." 542 | ? 2009 BY THE MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA j</page><page sequence="2">124.2 J Bruce Boehrer 543 (21-22)?attest to the role of Marxist and postmodernist theory in assailing the legiti macy of character as a literary construct. But the Marxist-postmodernist critique of literary character did not develop in a vac uum; it runs parallel to a broader assault on the category of the human itself. This broader line of argument is typified by the poststruc turalist tradition in current animal studies theory, which objects to the Benthamite and Kantian schools of animal rights philosophy, represented by Peter Singer and Tom Regan respectively, on the grounds that these seek to protect nonhuman animals by extend ing to them a notion of human rights (or in Singers case human ethical subjectivity) that is itself intellectually untenable.2 Thus, rela tive to the animal other, Derrida refuses "to assign, interpret or project" meaning (the impulses of traditional animal rights theory, I take it), while likewise resisting the Carte sian reflex to "suspend . . . one s compassion and... depriv[e] the animal of every power of manifestation" (387). Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari replace the notion of being with one of becoming, located in "an objective zone of indetermination or uncertainty . . . 'that makes it impossible to say where the boundary between the human and animal lies'" (273). Giorgio Agamben, arguing that "[i]n our cul ture, the decisive political conflict... is that between the animality and the humanity of man" concludes that "what is decisive here is only the 'between,' the interval... between the two terms, their immediate constellation in a non-coincidence" (80, 83; my italics). Each of these positions assumes that to ground politi cal or ethical action on notions of the human is to perpetuate the very inequities that poli tics and ethics are intended to remedy; hence, the deconstruction of the human emerges as a philosophical imperative. There can be no doubt that literary criti cism's discomfort with the concept of char acter is related to this growing theoretical impulse to deconstruct the human/animal divide. After all, if a given philosophical cat egory (the human) proves defective, it follows that the category's major literary manifestation (character) should share in its inadequacies. In what follows, I shall argue that the notion of character develops in English writing as an early effort to evade this philosophical crisis: as a means of manufacturing and perpetuating the distinction between people and animals. This is not how the turn to character and character criticism has usually been understood. Knights explains it in classic New Critical fashion, as a failure of linguis tic engagement?in the case of Shakespeare scholars, "an inability to appreciate the Eliza bethan idiom and a consequent inability to discuss Shakespeare's plays as poetry" (26). Lodge's Robyn Penrose, for her part, follows the Brechtian apercu that literary illusionism aims to transform audiences into "the passive consumers] of a finished, unchangeable art object offered to them as 'real'" (Eagleton 64); thus, for her, "the rise of the novel (the liter ary genre of Character' par excellence) in the eighteenth century coincided with the rise of capitalism" and its endless search for pliable markets (21). For scholars following Ian Watt, the rise of literary character derives from the eighteenth-century tendency to "pa[y] greater attention to the particular individual than had been common before" (Watt 18), a tendency deriving from the philosophical skepticism of figures like Descartes, Locke, and Hume. While these narratives trace the ascendancy of literary character to different historical events (the development of new language practices, the birth of capitalism, the rise of scientific empiricism), they agree by locating it in the eighteenth century and identifying the novel as its exemplary genre. Still, if one takes at face value the eighteenth-century passion for Shakespeare as a creator of characters, it challenges both the chronological focus on the eighteenth century and the generic focus on prose fiction. And in any case, as Fowler's recent work on Chaucer ar ft o "t ft V? &amp;&gt; 2 a 3 &amp; y 0 a o o w ft</page><page sequence="3">544 Animal Studies and the Deconstruction of Character PMLA 0 o "O 0 X ? ? o ? 4* has shown, it is patently silly to suppose that pre-Enlightenment authors had no literary characters, if one defines these simply?in Fowler's preferred way?as "social persons" (27). Moreover, the term character itself, as applied to the "description, delineation, or de tailed report of a person's qualities" ("Charac ter," def. 14), predates the eighteenth century. The 0?D's earliest recorded instance of this usage comes from James Howell's Letters, of 1645, but even this is unfairly belated; with the publication of Joseph Hall's Theophrastan Characters in 1608, the English already pos sessed a fully formed literary exemplar of the definition. Indeed, Theophrastus's works play a central role in establishing the noun char acter as an English literary term, and in the process they reveal the word's embeddedness in an ancient tradition of philosophical medi tation on the nature of human identity. Theophrastus is best remembered for treatises in the fields we would now call bi ology and psychology.3 These works span the disciplinary divide?between "the representa tion of nonhumans" and "the representation of citizens" (Latour 28)?that Bruno Latour identifies with modernity's "separation of natural and political powers" (13). In this re gard, they preserve the cross-disciplinary fo cus of Theophrastus's master, Aristotle, whom Theophrastus succeeded in 322 BCE as head of the Peripatetic school in Athens. Indeed, if readers have detected a "botanical" impulse in his Characters (Boyce 5), that is because Theophrastus himself was working squarely in an Aristotelian tradition in which "[t]he methodical treatment of poiesis in the Poetics is similar to the orderly classification of the body in the History of Animals" (Craik 158). In this tradition, the study of rhetoric and the study of natural history, the study of people and the study of animals, emerge as parallel expressions of the same taxonomic impulse. It may be objected that this is merely a matter of form, that in substance the two un dertakings differ considerably. Perhaps, but the most recent translators of Theophrastus s Characters have traced its antecedents back to the lengthiest surviving verse fragment by Semonides of Amorgos, consisting of charac ter sketches of women whose "various vices (e.g. filthiness, cunning, extravagance) are ex plained by their creation from animals (e.g. the pig, fox, horse)" (Rusten and Cunningham 17). If, as the same editors aver, "the notion that individual good or bad traits of character may be isolated and studied separately" is "basic" to the philosopher s "whole enterprise" (13), then the Characters participates in an ethical project that encompasses the world of nonhu man animals as well. That, at least, is a major assumption of those other heirs to Aristotle, the bestiarists, when they identify the behavior of the halcyon hen as "an unexpected celebra tion of kindness" (White 124), or attribute to horses the capacity "to weep for man and feel the emotion of sorrow" (86), or expound on "[t]he merciful nature of lions" (Barber 25). As quaintly familiar as such language may be, it points to the historical investment of character study in observation of the nonhuman world. Thus, from the standpoint of animal stud ies it becomes appropriate to view the besti ary entry as a particular variety of character study and to view the Theophrastan character as a particular variant of the bestiary entry. In terms of early modern English literary his tory, this linkage becomes especially visible in the "birds of prey"?Voltore, Corbaccio, and Corvino?who populate Ben Jonson's Vol pone (1.2.89), as well as in Nano's claim, in the same play, to have passed former lives as an "ox and asse, cammell, mule, goat, and brock" (1.2.22). Volpones characterological besti ary draws simultaneously on the traditional figures of beast fable and epic, derived from post-Aristotelian animal lore, and on the stock figures of New Comedy, based on post Aristotelian psychology. In the latter respect, the linkage to Theophrastus again seems clear enough; Menander is said to have been one of the philosophers students (Diogenes Laertius</page><page sequence="4">12 4-2 ] Bruce Boehrer 545 485; bk. 5, pars. 36-37). And later English us age retains the affinity between human and animal traits in the sense of character as de noting "the distinguishing features of a spe cies or genus" ("Character ," def. 8b). But Jonson's carrion birds by no means exhaust the characterological possibilities of the animal in early modern literature. If we accept Fowler's working definition of literary characters as "social persons," compounded from overlapping "legal," "civic," "corporate," "economic," "kinship," and "literary" identi ties (16-17), the heavy integration of animals into all these aspects of early modern society makes it hard to see how one could reason ably deny them status as literary characters in their own right. Consider Montaigne's Apol ogy for Raymond Sebonde, which, apart from its inscrutable cat, abounds with sentient beasts: a magpie who, after "a profound study and withdrawal within herself," learns to mimic the sound of trumpets (341); elephants who help each other escape from traps (342); cranes and swallows with "the faculty of divi nation" (345); and so on. Or consider Baiardo in Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, Rinaldo's cun ning and faithful steed, who refuses to let Rinaldo mount him lest the horse's stead fast pursuit of Rinaldo's beloved Angelica be called off (2.20-23). Or consider the begin ning of Philip Sidney's Defense of Poesy, where Sidney relates John Pietro Pugliano's praise of the horse as "a peerless beast... the only ser viceable courtier without flattery, the beast of most beauty, faithfulness, courage, and such more ... that I think he would have persuaded me to have wished myself a horse" (3). One might protest that for Sidney Pugliano serves as an object of derision, an exponent of "unbelieved" opinions who defends these with "strong affection and weak arguments" (3). But this fact speaks precisely to my broader point: that in early modern culture the literal and figurative proximity of nonhuman to human animals elicited anxiety, generating what Rene Girard has called a "crisis of distinctions" (49). Puglianos character as a horseman (or horse/ man) inspires Sidney s disapproval, yet Pug liano also provides Sidney with the model and motive?"self-love" (3)?for the latter s defense of verse. In fact, Sidney s relation to Pugliano is far too close for comfort. It is the archetypal re lation of "scholar" to "master" (4), fraught with tension and ambivalence, qualities that receive figuration across the species barrier. Thus, it stands as a further irony that in Sidney's case "self-love" is the love of Philip, phil-hippos, bear ing in itself a trace of the anathematized other. This "crisis of distinctions" can be pre sented more broadly in Kuhnian terms as an emerging dilemma in the early modern dis course of species?in effect, as a philosophical problem for which Descartes and his followers presented a paradigm-shifting solution.4 Erica Fudge has traced this dilemma to inconsis tencies in the early modern understanding of how and when a human being may be re garded as truly rational and therefore truly human: on the one hand, "infants are not fully human, insofar as human status can only be designated truly by the actions that evidence the possession of a rational soul" (48); on the other hand, "a human can literally become an animal when acting without reason" (66); and various subaltern categories of humanity (e.g., women, slaves, ethnic others) present further challenges to a conventional understanding of humanity as grounded in reason. In sum: There are natural born humans who can only be human because they possess the rational soul. Then there are humans in possession of the ra tional soul who require education to become truly human. Finally, there are humans who possess rational souls, can be educated, but are still less human than the human. Thus the cat egory begins to collapse into absurdity. (58) Descartes solved this problem with mathemati cal elegance by elevating human reason to the status of a first principle, requiring no proof out side the philosophers own inference. The way was thus clear for human beings to discount the 3" ft 0 -t ft 3 &amp; 3 ft p* y o a o o ?w ft</page><page sequence="5">546 Animal Studies and the Deconstruction of Character PMLA o 0 X +-&gt; ? ? ft (A 'Z, o 4&gt; X apparent sentience of other animals by dismiss ing it as an anthropomorphic projection, so that how beasts behaved no longer told us anything about what they thought or felt. To this extent, the Cartesian cogito is itself a product of the inward turn, an application of skepticism to the philosophers own beliefs and instincts until what remains?skepticism itself?becomes the ground of his identity as a rational being. And, appropriately enough, this inward turn takes the confessional mode as its proper form of literary expression: I judged that I was as prone to error as anyone else, and I rejected as false all the reasoning I had hitherto accepted as valid proof. Finally ... I resolved to pretend that everything that had ever entered my head was no more true than the illusions of my dreams. But immedi ately afterwards I noted that, while I was try ing to think of all things being false in this way, it was necessarily the case that I, who was thinking them, had to be something. (Descartes 28; pt. 4, par. 32) In effect, the Cartesian self arises from and entails the exploration of a new notion of character: not an Aristotelian taxonomy of shared attributes but rather a sense of per sonal identity as singular and doubtful, consisting in particularity and observation, privileging mind over body and interior over exterior. This, of course, is the mode of char acter celebrated in the grand literary achieve ments of the late seventeenth, the eighteenth, and the nineteenth centuries: the novel, the illusionistic theater, the cult of sentiment, and the critical veneration of Shakespeare. Hence we may recognize this notion of character, in its originary Cartesian moment, as an instrument for defining and maintaining the species barrier. It is no accident that the Dis course on the Method remains almost equally fa mous for two distinct philosophical postulates: the cogito and the bete-machine. These princi ples emerge hand in hoof from Descartes s med itations, in symbiotic and mutually reinforcing relation: the former crafts a notion of humanity composed of inwardness and speculation, while the latter denies such qualities to the nonhuman. Taken together, these philosophical constructs offer a response to earlier notions of human character that had come by the early modern period to appear increasingly untenable. In the process, Descartes s principles also paved the way for new literary techniques of representing the human, techniques that in turn proved es sential in consolidating the species distinction on which they themselves were based. But, to end where I began, what then of Shakespeare? How is this very pre-Cartesian playwright conscripted so durably into the Enlightenment project of literary charac ter construction? We might start to answer this question by noting how haunted Shake speare is by the relation between people and other animals. From Launce and Crab to the asinine Bottom, from the "inexecrable dog" Shylock (Merchant of Venice 4.1.128) to Ban quo s currish murderers (Macbeth 3.1.91-104), from Lear's "pelican daughters" (3.4.75) to the man/fish Caliban, the poet's work seems like nothing so much as a protracted, uneasy meditation on the ties that bind species to gether and the traumas that tear them apart. From this standpoint, Shakespeare's particu lar claim to fame may lie not so much in the characters he created as in the discomfort he expressed through them: that is to say, in the resonance and clarity with which he lent voice to the problem of distinctions that preceded the Cartesian moment. Perhaps there is some thing a bit complacent, even self-infatuated, in recent efforts to celebrate him as the inventor of the human. Perhaps we should remember him instead as the poet of humanity in crisis.
