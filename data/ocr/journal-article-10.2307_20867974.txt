<plain_text><page sequence="1">French Studies 127 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY By Sheila Mason, Senior Lecturer in French in the University of Birmingham, and D. J. Adams , Lecturer in French in the University of Manchester 1. General language and thought. The most comprehensive volume to appear in 1983 was undoubtedly the Actes du Sixieme Congres International des Lumieres, Oxford, The Voltaire Foundation (also StV, 216) xx + 473 pp., containing abstracts of several hundred papers and covering far too wide a range even to be summarized here. This event coincided with an exhibition held in the same city, for which a sumptuous catalogue was issued: Les Lumieres dans les Pays-Bas autrichiens et la Principaute de Liege, Brussels, Bibliotheque royale, vi + 217 pp. The scholarly world of 18th-century studies is exhaus tively documented in its individual and institutional aspects in the International directory of eighteenth-century studies, ed. A. Brown, Oxford, The Voltaire Foundation, 177 pp. M. Le Guern, 'Le Dictionnaire de Trevoux (1704)', CAIEF, 35:51-68, unravels its publishing history, both as an initiative to counter Protestant influence and a vehicle for R. Simon's Biblical criticism, revealing an unexpected precursor of the Encyclopedie. Y. Giraud, 'Le Dictionnaire comique de Le Roux (1718)', ib., 69-86, examining Le R.'s categories of usage (often ill defined) and the range of his subject matter, discovers a linguistic analogue of the burlesque tonality characteristic of contemporary literature and drama. Sebastiano Vecchio, // Circuito semiotico e la politica, Acireale, Galatea, 1982, 189 pp., while ventilating certain semiological and sociolinguistic issues, offers a fascinating illustra tion, despite Saussure's denial of its possibility, of political authority attempting total regulation of the teaching and use of language. Examining the articulation in Barere, Babeuf and, above all, the abbe Gregoire of linkages between national unification and the repression of minority languages, and social levelling and linguistic education, he convincingly establishes the phenomenon of 'linguistic jacobin ism'. J. Chouillet, 'Le message des Lumieres est-il de notre temps', DS, 21:33-44, uses Diderot in the main to show the Enlightenment prefiguring the antinomies of our world, and crystallizes the value of its 'pari sur la rationalite'. R. Maiocchi, 'Scienza e filosofia della scienza da Newton a Laplace', Acme, 35, 1982:369-444, provides a wide-ranging review of the biological sciences and physics, including such topics as the methodological stance of Buffon, Diderot, and Condorcet; and, most significantly, tracing the penetration of experi mental currents into Cartesianism via the Malebranchian school's involvement with Newtonian optics. Equally abstract matters are</page><page sequence="2">128 French Studies dealt with in M. Benitez, 'Naturalisme et atomisme: le refus des atomes et du vide dans la litterature clandestine', StV, 215, 1982:121-38, a learned and comprehensive presentation of the view that atomism was widely repudiated because it was felt to be inadequate to explain movement or change, while the vacuum, the antithesis of matter, was regarded as an indication that there might exist a non-material being, God. L. Crocker, 'The idea of a "neutral" universe in the French Enlightenment', DS, 21145-76, sets out, at excessive length, to retread much familiar ground in illuminating its 'disenchantment'. But, while the proposition that some thinkers may have seen man as 'alien, the creator of value in a value-free world' is valid, C. fails throughout to discern that characterizing nature, after Diderot, as 'la maison du plus fort' is as fallacious by this measure as projecting on it a benevolent finalism. Nor can D.'s links with Romanticism and its pathetic fallacy be disproven, simply by forgetting Dorval's 'sejour sacre de l'enthousiasme' (Entretiens sur le Fits naturel). D. Bini, 'Leopardi and French materialism', CLS, 20:154-67, rehearses the commonplace of L.'s debt to d'Holbach, but with a view to revealing a so far undetected (and unprovable) parente with La Mettrie, from both of whom L. departs, however, to join Sade in substituting pessimism for their consequential optimism. Secular ist tendencies in society are the general province within which La Tolerance civile (EDHS, vol. hors serie, 1), Brussels U.P., 1982, 258 pp., falls. Bearing upon the history of ideas one finds J. Roegiers, 'Les theologiens de Louvain contre l'Edit de Tolerance (1781-1782)', ib., pp. 69-78, which traces echoes of earlier controversies, such as that over P. Rousseau's Journal encyclopedique, in their reactions. C. O'Brien, 'Jansenists and civil toleration in France, 1775-1778: Le Paige, Guidi and Robert de Saint-Vincent', ib., pp. 183-93, reveals a surprising Jansenist perspective on French intolerance over the preceding century, and, investigating the support of clerics associated with the Nouvelles Ecclesiastiques for measures anticipating the Josephine Reform, offers a guide to the penetration of ecclesiastical attitudes by currents of Enlightenment thought. More surprises are found in G. Weill, 'Les lettres patentes de 1784 sur lesjuifs d'Alsace: tolerance ou despotisme eclaire?', ib., pp. 201-13, where, following an interesting survey of the regionally varied conditions of French Jewry, the capital made out of existing exemptions and privileges by campaigners for Protestant toleration is indicated. J. Vercruysse, 'Les "Maximes sur la tolerance des secteurs" de Neny, ou les etapes d'une revolution silencieuse', Lias, 9, 1982: 233-70, in an impeccable presentation of a chapter of N.'s MS Memoires ecclesiastiques and of its genesis, sheds light on the pragmatic liberalism and Erastianism of a small Catholic intelligentsia in the Low Countries. M.-H. Cotoni,</page><page sequence="3">The Eighteenth Century 129 'L'image d'Epictete dans le rationalisme des lumieres', Actes . . . (Nice), pp. 111-17, uses it to gauge the progress of attitudes to Stoicism, and concludes, fairly predictably that its main functions were to epitomize hostility to Christ and to crystallize the aspiration for order and liberty. W. Davis, 'China, the Confucian ideal, and the European Age of Enlightenment5, JHI, 44, no. 4 :523-48, concludes that the philosophes took what suited them from the writings of the sage, rejecting his emphasis on inner spirituality, and using him in their defence of individual rights. This conclusion would have had more significance had it been set in the wider field of 18th-century French attitudes to China. O. H. Bonnerot, 'La "Legende" de Zoroastre au siecle des Lumieres', EDHS, 2:323-56, is a thorough and detailed study of how Z. became a philosophe to 18th-century minds. The birth of a racial myth, and its subsequent literary and ideological fortune are extensively treated in Nos Ancetres. J. Sole, 'Le my the gaulois sous Louis XIV: Paul Pezron et son Antiquite des Celtes", pp. 37-40 isolates the ethnological and etymological constructions supporting P.'s panbretonism. R. Mas, 'Dom Jacques Martin, historien des Gaulois (1648-1751), pp. 41-50, shows how M.'s rehabilitation of the Gauls remains anchored to the methodology and conceptual structures of his parent culture ? Biblical and Greco Roman. C. Volpilhac, 'Les Gaulois a l'Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres de 1701 a 1793', pp. 77-83, uses the Academie's Memoires to chart the graph of interest in the Gauls as a subject of erudition, and, by focusing more closely on the work of Duclos and Freret, illuminates their gradual incorporation into national history via the study of religions, and their eventual transformation into vehicles for philosophical criticism. D. Ligou, 'Du germanisme au celtisme. "Nos ancetres les Gaulois" vus par quelques historiens bourguignons du XVIlie siecle', pp. 85-96, traces in a very readable style, the emergence of the idea of a sequence of ethnic occupation from the resistant matrix of Burgundian germanism. The consolida tion of an autochthonous view of ancestral origins is then linked with the search for a class image on the part of a rising bourgeoisie. In contrast, J. Ehrard, 'Les Gaulois dans V Encyclopedie", pp. 99-106, finds there a certain vagueness of ethnic definition, and a treatment marked by typical preoccupation with economic and demographic prosperity, rather than libertarian nationalism. R. Graham, 'The revolutionary bishops and the philosophes', ECS, 16, no. 2:117-40, studies the bishops' attempts to insist that Christian teaching should come before the inculcation of secular philosophy without excluding it, and clearly shows how they used Rousseau, Voltaire, Mably, etc., both to support and oppose the doings of the Revolution. J.-R. Surrateau, 'Cosmopolitisme et patriotisme au siecle des Lumieres', 5</page><page sequence="4">13? French Studies Les Lumieres: Cosmopolitisme et Nationality, Dijon U.P., 1982, 153 pp., 1-34, is a useful tour d'horizon, which concludes that the feeling of nationhood was born in France (and elsewhere) with the Revolution, having been hitherto the preserve of the philosophes. However, Mornet long ago demonstrated, in his Origines intellectuelles de la Revolution jranqaise, that matters were more complex than S. here makes out. J. J. Clerc, 'Etat ? Nation, Citoyen, au temps de la Revolution francaise', ib., pp. 135-52, relies heavily on contemporary documents to show how the citizen came to be not the legislator proposed by Rousseau, but the elector who entrusted representative power to the depute. literary, social, and cultural history. Pierre M. Conlon, Le Siecle des Lumieres: Bibliographic chronologique, Vol. 1, 1716-22, Geneva, Droz, xxii + 548pp., sets out to provide a summary location and collation of every printed work by French authors to have been published from 1716 to 1789: one can only welcome and salute this heroic endeavour. C. Sorgeloos, 'La bibliotheque de Charles de Lorraine gouverneur-general des Pays-Bas autrichiens', RBPH, 60, 1982:809-38, analyses, tabulates, and describes the history of this extensive collection, representative perhaps in its overwhelming proportion of French volumes, exceptional in its enlightened encyc lopedism. Rather less convincing is S.'s claim that the contents, dominated by history and science (largely military), reflect the buying habits of the century, rather than the typical pattern of composition. F. Fossier, 'Un financier erudit, Clement Charles Francois de Laverdy (1724-1793)', JS, 1981:397-421, sheds light both on L.'s varied output of historical, jurisprudential and devotio nal works, and, more centrally, on the bibliographical enterprises of the Academie des Inscriptions in the second half of the century. R. Pomeau and J. Ehrard, *De Fenelon a Voltaire, Arthaud, 416 pp. Michel Kerautret, La Litterature Jranqaise du dix-huitieme siecle (Coll. Que sais-je?), PUF, 128 pp., has produced an uncontroversial, lively account of the basic facts of the subject, and manages to be a good deal more readable than many of his competitors in the field. Y. Belaval, 'La critique litteraire en France au dix-huitieme siecle', DS, 21:19-31, believes that the 18th century was concerned with the meaning of the text, and judged it by the criterion of taste, but it leaves aside the 'explication de texte' as taught in schools, in which other criteria, historical and rational, were involved. Rudolf Behrens, Problematische Rhetorik. Studien zur franzbsischen Theoriebildung der Affekt rhetorik zwischen Cartesianismus und Fruhaujkldrung, Munich, Fink, 1982, 236 pp., while concentrating the major part of his attention on the establishment in the 17th century of a Cartesian rhetoric, displaying a shift from the prescriptive to the explicative mode, does obliquely</page><page sequence="5">The Eighteenth Century illuminate the development in the 18th of aesthetic and stylistic theory. This is effected in the course of his analysis of Bernard Lamy's UArt de parler, the considerable influence of which, in the later period, is related to the particular curriculum and social context of the Oratorian colleges. Although already a solid and scrupulous study, one might have wished for some indication of parallel tendencies in other areas bearing upon the subject of human cognition and receptivity. J. Proust, 'La Marguerite au gout du temps ou L'Hep tameron revu par le XVIIIe siecle', Schalk Vol., pp. 279-91, docu ments the lexical, syntactic, structural, and stylistic modifications typically imposed upon Medieval and Renaissance texts, by means of four 'modern' editions. His discoveries warn us that, even in the absence of any bowdlerizing intentions, the implicit sense of a work will be transformed. J. Schulze, 'Zur Pragmatik der Pastorale im 18. Jahrhundert', Erzahlforschung, pp. 403-17, uses Bernardin's Paul et Virginie for an experimental exercise in 'reception theory'. On the one hand, the abundance of 18th-century theorists of the pastoral genre would seem to offer the means by which the intentions of authors and the expectations of readers might be established; on the other B.'s text, a late and marginal example, appears to demonstrate these categories being used to negate the central fantasies of its utopianism. N. Ferrier, 'Comment un roi devient heros: Louis XIV dans la litterature frangaise de son temps', Actes . . . (Nice), pp. 167-81, illuminates some parallel phenomena of L.'s allegedly original apotheosis: the reinvigoration of the figure of the demi-god with the resurgence of the theory of divine right, and the Jesuit invention of a new, universal, Christian monarch. Perhaps more striking is her revelation that the process actually intensified during the years of decline. R. Shackleton, 'The death of Louis XIV and the new freedom', Studies in the 18th Century, 5:79-88, covers, with familiar reliability and balance, some neglected facets of the Regency. Policies towards Jansenism, the flowering of libertinage erudit, Voltaire's relationship with the Regent, all are ultimately wedded to his ambivalent portrait in Montesquieu's Lettres de Xenocrate a Pheres. W. Rex, 'Sobering reflections on a forgotten French opera libretto', ECS, 16:389-400, has discovered in Poulain de Saint-Foix's Deucalion et Pirrha (1755) one exception, Racinian in its intensity and unity, to the general rule of luxuriant expansiveness in the music and action of tragedie lyrique. H.-U. Gumbrecht et al., 'Histoire et langage: travaux allemands en lexicologie historique et en histoire conceptuelle', RHMC, 30, no. 2:185-96, provides a stimulating introduction to the application of textual praxis in historical research, opening up a meeting-ground for historians and linguists. H.-U. Gumbrecht, 'Chants revolutionnaires, maitrise de l'avenir et niveau du sens</page><page sequence="6">132 French Studies collectif', ib., 235-56, proceeds in a thorough and challenging analysis of three celebratory works by Marie-Joseph Chenier, to demonstrate the complementarity of reception theory and the history of mentalities, approaching his material as a symptom rather than a sign of a particular situation. P.-E. Knabe, 'Esthetique et art culinaire', DhS, 15:125-36, is a windy account of the origins in Hutcheson, Crousaz, and Du Bos, of aesthetic notions which Foncemagne blended into his classic cookery books. L. Andries, 'Cuisine et litterature populaire', ib., 33-47, perusing, at the other end of the scale, almanacs and broadsheets, reveals the topic of food, not as a medium of cultural exchange, but of re-echoing archaic fantasies. Culture in the all too elevated sense is broached by A. Frost, 'The perception of culture's relativity in the second half of the eighteenth-century', Studies in the 18th Century, 5:129-41, where the mariner Cook and British colonial policy are contrasted with a very debatable view of the philosophes as prisoners of anthropological universalism. The fascination of the exotic for European and particularly French minds is amply documented in J. Garagnon, 'French imaginary voyages to the Austral Lands in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries', Australia and the European Imagination (Australian National University: Humanities Research Centre, Monograph 1), 1982, pp. 87-107, through a lucid presentation of compilations such as De Brosses, Histoire des navigations aux Terres Australes (1756). There follows an equally clear analysis of antipodean Utopias, and the salient features of their correspondingly egalitarian and timeless ideology. R. Wuthenow, Tnselgliick. Reise und Utopie in der Literatur des XVIII. Jahrhunderts', Utopieforschung, 11, pp. 321-35, applies a similar formula, but with different emphases and conclusions: 18th-century comment is judged fairly myopic, and attention is focused on Bougainville and Diderot, the latter being credited with the destruction of Utopia. H.-G. Funke, 'Aspekte und Probleme der neueren Utopiediskussion in der franzosischen Litera turwissenschaft', ib., 1, pp. 193-219, though not exhaustive and somewhat repetitive, offers an indispensable survey covering output from Ruyer's UUtopie et les utopies (1950). His bibliographical section is systematically organized, and complemented by discussion of semantic history and the problems of generic definition. M. Levin, 'The wedding of art and science in late eighteenth-century France. A means of building social solidarity', Eighteenth Century Life, 7, 1982, no. 3:54-73, is most informative and convincing in her presentation of the Institut National des Sciences et des Arts as a forum during the Directory and the Consulate for the elaboration of a doctrine of the mechanisms of art, informed by the principles of Newtonianism, as tools of social conditioning. Her discussion of Diderot and 'moral</page><page sequence="7">The Eighteenth Century 133 technology' is flawed by inadequate textual support and anachronis tic assumptions. J. Leith, 'Desacralization, resacralization and architectural planning during the French Revolution', ib., 74-84, similarly well illustrated, shows how militaristic monumentalism served propaganda, as it moved through its post-agitational, integra tionist phase. D. Irwin, 'Antiquity and industry: the fine and useful arts united', Studies in the 18th Century, 5:63-77, offers a wide-ranging and stimulating study of the relevance of antiquarian literature to the growing business of industrial design. Some insights are also furnished into the real influence of the Encyclopedie on craft training schemes at Sevres. On a broader comparative theme, Chantal Grell, Herculanum et Pompei: les recits des Voyageurs francais du dix-huitieme siecle, Naples, Centre Jean Berard, 230 pp., leaves no stone unturned in proving that the rediscovery of the two cities, while fascinating the few who had the means to visit them, made no general impact on French culture till the 19th century. Daniel Teysseire, Pediatrie des Lumieres: maladies et soins des enfants dans I3'Encyclopedie' et le 'Dictionnaire de Trevoux3, Vrin, 1982, 255 pp., is an important study, both because it emphasizes that, in the 18th century, the child was, contrary to what is often thought, recognized as an entity different from the adult, and because it brings to light yet another reason why the Encyclopedie was a greater work than its rival: it set out to provide answers to real medical problems, while the Jesuits merely described individual cases. L. Bourgeon, 'La peur d'etre enterre vivant au dix-huitieme siecle: mythe ou realite?'. RHMC, 30, no. 4:139-53, claims, from the evidence of wills, that this curious preoccupation was never wide spread: even after 1750, it seems, only some 4% of testators mention it. How much can be validly deduced by arguing along such lines is debatable. H. Liisebrink and R. Reichardt, 'La "Bastille" dans l'imaginaire social de la France a la fin du dix-huitieme siecle (1774? 99)', ib., no. 2:196-234, show, from a close examination of eight contemporary pamphlets, that if the Bastille was initially described as a 'prison', it was, by 1789, a symbol of despotic oppression, and the alleged scene of (largely fictitious) horrors: it became synonymous, in later years, with the tyranny of the Ancien Regime: an article to be read less for its rather predictable conclusions than for its unshakably solid documentation. H. Liisebrink, 'Memoire pour la fille Clereaux (Rouen 1785)', StV, 208,1982 :323-72, illuminating, under the aegis of Mornet, the role the courts were to play in the political mobilization of public opinion, reconstructs a paradigmatic 'proces a scandale', and publishes the defending lawyer's pamphlet. Besides illuminating the importance of the genre as a vector of social criticism, and a reflection of Beccaria, he documents the changing image of the 'avocat', the application of a rousseauist vocabulary, and the figure of the domestic</page><page sequence="8">134 French Studies servant, as one of the most frequent in 18th-century fiction and drama. Equally solid but less stimulating is Theodore Tarczylo, Sexe et liberteau siecle des Lumieres, Presses de la Renaissance, 310 pp. Less ambitious than its tide suggests, this is concerned primarily with works which condemned masturbation, particularly Bekker's Onania; such texts, it is argued, were instance of more widespread repressive attitudes towards the revolution in sexual values which was taking place. John Atkins, Sex in Literature, Vol. 4. High Noon: The Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, London, Calder/N.York, Riverrun Press, 1982, 365 pp., is anchored in an English perspective, and offers a general and synthetic approach, despite extensive coverage of the big names ? Crebillon, Casanova, Laclos, Restif and, most lavishly, Sade, On scholarly grounds the work is badly flawed: the paradox of a typical attitude characterized as commonsensical, and a literature dealing in the coinage of fantasy and fairy-tale is not explained; nor has A. read Laclos, since Valmont is presented as Merteuil's husband. For a painless initiation, however, the sections on Sade, very derivative of G. Lely, are of use. A virgin work, as regards the commoner variety of French pornography. publishing and journalism. R. Darnton, 'Policing writers in Paris, circa 1750', Studies in the 18th century, 5:143-55, displays some of the riches of the d'Hemery collection of reports in the B.N., which constitute the earliest known survey of writers as a social group. These yield graphs of age and social origins, facilitating the conclusion that the predominant type was the ambitious royal bureaucrat. They also provide entry into the writer's own world, one of clientage and protection, almost without exception. C. Todd, 'La redaction du Mercure de France (1721-1744): Dufresny, Fuzelier, La Roque', RHLF, 83:439-41, taps another unusual source, the 'minutier central des notaires', from whence emerges more sobering information on the mercenary motives of some, and the intricacies of the business relationships of the Mercure journalists after Buchet's death. S. Jiittner, 'Aufklarer zwischen Salon und Nation. Zur Einschatzung von Buch und Lekttire im 18. Jahrhun dert', Schalk Vol., pp. 152-83, covering such matters as the writer's self awareness, ideological attitudes associated with printing, the conditions of the market, change and continuity in moral reactions to reading, and the archaic elitism of the salons with their verbal mode of intercourse, in fact formulates few novel insights. *Dictionnaire desjournalistes (i6oo-ij8g), Supplement 11, ed. A.-M. Chouillet and F. Moureau, Grenoble U.P., 227 pp. 2. Non-Fiction individual authors d'alembert. D. F. Essar, 'Polemical intent and rhetorical style in D'Alembert's Eloges historiques', Man and Nature (Proceedings of the</page><page sequence="9">The Eighteenth Century 135 Canadian Society for i8th-Century Studies), London, Ontario, U.P., 1982, pp. 31-39, claims that the Eloges are riven by internal contradi tions: D'A. wants to be truthful, but he often tells lies, using the rhetorical devices which he condemns, and disguising his philosophic propaganda as the embodiment of universal principles. A clear and well-informed article. J. Pappas, 'D'Alembert et la nouvelle aristoc ratic', DhS, 15:335-43, discusses the Essai sur la Societe des gens de Lettres et des Grands, in which D'A. claimed for men of genius the privileges then enjoyed exclusively by the aristocracy. anquetil-duperron. Jean-Luc Kieffer, Anquetil-Duperron: ITnde en France au dix-huitieme siecle, Les Belles Lettres, 389 pp., is an exhaustive and fully-documented study of the great French oriental ist, but is marred by its naive, almost hagiographic, presentation. buffier. P. Swiggers, 'Grammaire et theorie du langage chez Buffier', DhS, 15:285-93, analyses the empirical and relativist qualities of the Grammaire francaise sur un plan nouveau of 1709. buffon. Pierre Gascar, Buffon, Gallimard, 267 pp., is a short biography for the general reader, to judge by the absence of any critical apparatus whatever. This, however, does not deprive it of merit as an unstuffy introduction to B.'s career as a scientist, silviculturalist, and thinker. It is sometimes refreshing that theory should be evaluated in the light of practical activity, where B. scores; furthermore, G. does not recoil from harsh verdicts: thus, the Histoire naturelle is impugned for its puerile anthropomorphism and maniche ism. challe. Difficultes sur la religion proposees au pere Malebranche, ed. Frederic Deloffre and Melehat Menemencioglu, Jean Touzot/ Oxford, The Voltaire Foundation, 576 pp. (also StV, 209,1982), offers a synoptic presentation of the Leningrad and Vence (Mazarine) MSS, the second of which was the basis of the Mortier edition (1970), here largely superseded. The importance of the text itself resides first in its status as one of the earliest expositions of critical and constructive deism, secondly in its procreation of the widely circu lated clandestine tract, he Militaire philosophe. The Introduction furnishes a full guide to its MS metamorphoses, and we are also treated to a Postface, where the quality and ingredients of Challe's deism are assessed, revealing his distance, from both 17th-century libertines and 18th-century philosophes. J. Chupeau, 'Le voyageur philosophe ou Robert Challe au miroir du Journal d'un voyage aux Indes\ StV, 215, 1982:45-61, confirms C.'s place at the beginning of the evolution of ideas and sensibilities in the Enlightenment, by presen ting to us the eclectic rationalist, and anti-dirigist Colbertist revealed in his recently re-edited journal.

Chouet's work as scientist and academic are systematically treated, and the sad reduction of the Academy to a purely regional status thoroughly documented. couthon. E.

Hans-Giinter Funke, Studien zur Reiseutopie der Fruhaufkldrung: Fontenelles 'Histoire des Ajaoiens\ Heidelberg, Carl Winter U.P., 1982, 686 pp., constitutes the interpretative basis for the edition, and, given that doubts about its authorship will survive, should command lasting attention for its scrupulous and detailed survey of 17th century travel literature, geographical knowledge, and major precur sors in the fictional and political Utopia. The burning question remains the attribution to F. of a work first published in 1768, and for which Funke can only produce circumstantial evidence and fairly loose parallels from authentic texts. An atheist, anti-despotic Utopia, dating as suggested from 1682, would indeed be remarkable.</page><page sequence="12">138 French Studies But the date arises out of the atheist controversy started by Bayle's Pensees sur la Comete, and accepting F.'s authorship (when there is nearly a century of possible alternatives), involves the interpolation into his philosophical development of an inexplicable phase of eclectic materialism girard.

It also offers a new collation with the autograph MS, and its own variant readings, while for the notes, the Boilisle and Lecestre edition (1879-1928) has been utilized. The text, with modernized orthography, is accompanied by a substantial range</page><page sequence="15">The Eighteenth Century 141 of supporting documentation: a history of MSS, chronology from 1562-1760, genealogical guide to the French Court, and in this volume two essential appendices ? the Additions au Journal de Dangeau, and the Relation du proces intente pour la preseance par M le marechal-duc de Luxembourg. C. introduces the edition with a lively and fairly comprehensive account of S.-S.'s life, the genesis of the Memoires, and much penetrating comment on his art and philosophy as a historian. One could only perhaps wish, when the name of Balzac is so frequently invoked, for more on his literary techniques and the texture of his style. * Memoires (1701-07), ed. Yves Coirault, vol.2, Gallimard (Pleiade), 1,706 pp. Jean de la Varende, M. le Due de Saint Simon et sa comedie humaine, Perrin, 488 pp., offers, not a biography, but a treatment of various aspects of his relationships and career as reflected in his writings and amplified by other historical materials. Its use is as a guide to the personnel of the Memoires, and it also attempts to characterize S.-S.'s attitude to various groups ? women, ministers, parlementaires, not very satisfactorily from a scholarly point of view, since the issues are simplified and isolated from each other. Its huge defect is the absence of critical apparatus. turgot. Christine Bordes and Jean Morange, ed.

The Hermann edition proceeds on its stately way with the appearance of vol. 19, 'Musique', ed.

Delon, 'Editer Diderot', RHLF, 83, no. 2:241-48. F. A. Spear, 'Bibliographic de Diderot: Supplement No. 1', DS, 21:139-53, updates his indispensable Bibliographie of 1980. Peter France, Diderot (Coll.

Geoffrey Bremner, Order and Chance. The Pattern of Diderot's Thought, CUP, viii + 264 pp., explores the ways in which D. comes to terms with a disordered universe in his political and philosophical thought; a stimulating study, though Moi's role in Le Neveu is oversimplified. thought. A.-M. and J. Chouillet, 'Diderot et les despotes', Mots, 7:31-48, uses a computer analysis of the Principes de politique des souverains and other texts to show the (unconscious?) prevalence of metaphors which present the state literally as a body politic: a rich study enshrining principles which others would do well to ponder. J. Chouillet, 'Diderot and America', SECC, 12:223-30, restates D.'s comments on America found in the Histoire des deux Indes. D. Goodman, 'The structure of political argument in Diderot's Supple ment au Voyage de Bougainville', DS, 21:123-37, sees dialogue as the instrument whereby social critique becomes an argument for political reform: in the process of dialogue, D. attempts to define what is natural in all societies. R. A. Leigh, 'Diderot's Tahiti', Studies in the 18th Century, 5:113-28, relates the Supplement to 18th-century primi tivism and to the influence of Dom Deschamps, showing the ways in which the text differed from what Bougainville actually described: a fine study, but one would have been more grateful still to know whether Deschamps had any influence on the two contes which, together with the Supplement, form a triptych. R. Grimsley, 'Reason and imagination in Diderot's moral philosophy', ib., 103-11, deals mainly with post-1770 works, thus oversimplifying Diderot's position and ignoring its evolution. M. B. Kelly, 'Saying by implicature: the two voices of Diderot in the Lettre sur les Aveugles', SECC, 12:231-41, evaluates the Lettre in Grician terms, but finds little to say that cannot be said without them. A more stimulating application of modern critical techniques can be found in A. Strugnell, 'Les fonctions textuelles du moi dans deux dialogues philosophiques de Diderot', StV, 208, 1982:176-81, who maintains, in a brief but rewarding study, that, in the Entretien d'un pere and the Entretien d'un philosophe avec la marechale, the distance between the 'moi narrant' and the 'moi narre' is used to undermine the apparent superiority of the narrator. A. Vartanian, 'La Mettrie and Diderot revisited', DS, 21:155-97, is an outstanding revaluation of their intellectual relationship, which shows La M. to have been the source of many of the most original ideas in the Aveugles, the Sourds et Muets, and, with the Ouvrage de Penelope, Le Neveu too. This concise study is superior toj. W. Schmidt, 'Diderot and Lucretius: the De rerum natura and Lucretius' legacy in Diderot's scientific, aesthetic and ethical thought', StV, 208, 1982:183-294, an over-long piece, with unoriginal comments about e.g. the Lettre sur les aveugles or the Reve de D'Alembert, though it would</page><page sequence="17">The Eighteenth Century H3 be churlish to deny that, overall, it closes a major gap in Diderot studies. A. Ibrahim, 'Le statut des anomalies dans la Philosophic de Diderot', DhS, 15:312-27, argues that D. attempts to account for monsters by using the metaphor of the game of chance and of natural grafting, but this link is not made as explicit as it needs to be. V. E. Swain, 'Diderot's Paradoxe sur le comedien: the paradox of reading', StV, 208, 1982:1-71, is a demanding study which, however, blurs some of D.'s own distinctions, fails to justify the assertion that 'sensibilite cannot communicate itself, and jumps inelegantly about between literal and 'figural' readings. R. Mortier, 'D'un prejuge esthetique de Diderot', Schalk Vol., pp. 254-60, sees D. as a neo classicist, with all the prejudices implied by the term; M. pays no attention to the imagination and enthusiasm which take D. far beyond the strictures of his predecessors in aesthetics. Ian J. Lochhead, The Spectator and the Landscape in the Art Criticism of Diderot and his Contemporaries (Studies in the Fine Arts, 14), Michigan, UMI Research Press 1982, xiii+ 119 pp., ^s a short and convenient examination of the rise of landscape painting in 18th-century France to a position second only to that of historical subjects. However, in discussing the Salons, L. generalizes too readily from isolated statements, ignoring the subtle shifts in D.'s thinking. prose fiction and theatre. J. Rustin, 'Le personnage et la fonction de Selim dans les Bijoux indiscrets', EDHS, 2, 1982:57-105, rejects the (allegedly) conventional view that S. is to be identified with the Due de Richelieu, and suggests that his real function is to criticize the 'Grand Siecle' of Louis XIV, and thus substitute himself, in the reader's eyes, for Mangogul and Mirzoza. P. Hoffmann, 'Note sur la signification philosophique de Selim', ib., 108-25, has a more intellectually robust view of S., who is now said to represent a 'rationalisme experimental' which lies half-way between the 'dogma tisme empirique' of Mangogul and the 'dogmatisme metaphysique' of Mirzoza. V. Mylne, 'What Suzanne knew: lesbianism and La Religieuse\ StV, 208, 1982:167-73, argues that at least some of the inconsistencies in Suzanne's narrative dealing with the homosexual ity of the Mother Superior can be explained by the author's wish to make S. both innocent and aware of the dangers which she had avoided. J. Garagnon, 'Diderot et Tyssot de Patot: une source pour l'histoire du Juif d'Avignon?', DS, 21:111-22, points to striking resemblances between the Voyages de Jacques Masse 2mA one of the most scurrilous episodes in Le Neveu de Rameau, without trying to force the parallel too hard. J. Hulbert, 'Diderot in the text of Hegel: a question of intertextuality', StRom, 22, no. 2:267-92, is a pretentious article, which, however, repays study for its keen insights into both Le Neveu and Hegel's reading of it, which, it is argued, privileges Lui because</page><page sequence="18">144 French Studies his discourse and that of H. eliminate contradictions which threaten the integrity of their positions. The contes have not attracted much attention of late. V. E. Swain, 'Conventional wisdom and conventio nal acts: the narrative contract in Diderot's Ceci n'est pas un Conte', ECS, 17, no. i: 14-27, is a confused article. S. maintains that the conte enshrines two views of language, which is both referential and arbitrary, so that the text undercuts its own assumptions. This perfectly legitimate thesis is made to depend, however, on an overt misreading of 'convenir', which is taken to refer to 'conventions', when it clearly means 'agreements'. Jacques has fared better. W. F. Edmiston, 'L'Histoire de Gousse n'est pas un conte: presence et absence du narrateur dans un episode de Jacques le fataliste3, KRQ, 30, no. 3:323-29, is a well-presented analysis of the narrative techniques (suppression of the narrator, manipulation of tenses) by means of which D. gives the impression that the Gousse episode is not fictitious. M. Gusmao, 'Sur la scene litteraire dans Jacques le fataliste: (dialogues, redites et hypotheses)', Ariane, 1, 1982:87-104 and 2:93-129, is an overblown attempt to tease out the complexities of the reader-author relationship as it appears at the opening of the work and in its numerous 'intertextuaP borrowings. G. Neumann, 'Diderot, pre curseur de Beckett: la modernite dans Jacques le fataliste', NZJFS, 4, no. 1:43-58, claims that in B.'s novels, as in Jacques, themes revolve around one another in a constant spiral, while, in both, the search for the real self is conducted in true picaresque fashion. j. Garagnon, 'Diderot et la genese de Jacques le Fataliste: sur une lettre de Meister pere', SF, 27, no. 1:81-82, argues that M. was referring to a reading of part of Jacques, and did not mean that the whole text, as it existed in 1771, could be read in two hours. A.-M. Chouillet, 'Dossier du Fils naturel et du Pere de famille', StV, 208, 1982:73-166, is a scrupulously detailed list of documents relating to performances of the plays and reactions to them, with a description of 18th-century editions and translations: an indispens able accompaniment to the study of the plays. encyclopedie. j. Lough, 'Encore V Encyclopedie', Schalk Vol, pp. 224-35, adds the Cinq annees litteraires of P. Clement to the list of 18th-century periodicals in which the work is discussed, and shows that to Romily, the author of the article 'Tolerance', the Contrat social was the justification of intolerance towards the atheist, whatever D. may have said to the contrary in other articles. L. Kerslake, 'The sources of some literary articles in the Encyclopedie', StV, 215, 1982:139-61, has identified the authors of a number of articles, and tracked down more than 30 sources. Giuseppe A. Roggerone, L3Encyclopedie e la Satira, Napoli, Guida, 142 pp., concludes that Palissot's limited outlook led him, in his involvement with the</page><page sequence="19">The Eighteenth Century H5 philosophes, to reduce what could have been important intellectual differences to mere personalities: an Italian translation of Les Philosophes is provided as an appendix. MONTESQUIEU M. has been rather neglected this year. He occupies a major place in two comparative studies in the field of history and politics, of very different approach and weight. Norman Hampson, Will and Circum stance. Montesquieu, Rousseau and the French Revolution, London, Duck worth, vii 4- 282 pp., is essentially a vulgarizing work, offering a rapid and superficial synthesis of the salient features of each named thinker, a brief examination of their joint impact on the Revolutionary generation, and nine chapters on the Revolutionaries themselves, chiefly Mercier, Brissot, Marat, and Robespierre. There is much on M. and R. that a specialist of either could not stomach: slick and slipshod generalizations which would collapse on simple confronta tion with a standard text. It is scarcely credible, for instance, that M.'s 'esprit general' can be defined as 'the spontaneous expression of what the people want' (p. 57); or R.'s objective summarized as 'poverty rather than riches for all' (p. 38), especially in close proximity to his characterization as a Lockian defender of property rights. Beneath it all, one detects the absence of historical perspective: is the optic modern, or that of the 18th century? In the Revolutionary section, this is compounded by a lack of critical discernment, with the conflation of doctrinal, polemical and propagandist discourse. One hopes that it will not become an easy read for students. Georges Benrekassa, La Politique et sa memoire. La politique et Vhistorique dans la pensee des Lumieres, Payot, 370 pp., at the other end of the spectrum, might repel them as esoteric, even though it addresses the trinity, M., Rousseau, and Voltaire. Conceptually ambitious and densely writ ten, under the tutelary genius of Adorno, much painful methodologi cal self-interrogation leads into studies of M.'s Considerations, R.'s second Discours, V.'s Essai sur les mosurs, and substantial chapters on geographical determinism and Roman history in the Lois. Rather than pursuing the origins of historicism, B. set out to examine how the idea of history presented itself and survived. In M.'s case, he attempts to restore specificity to the political thought through the study of the Lois's more arcane elements, and should be applauded for his enterprise. C. Rosso, 'Montesquieu et l'humanisme latin', CAIEF, 35:235-50, surveys several facets of M.'s cohabitation with the 'Anciens': his use of Latin, his involvement with its civilization, especially as mediated by the Renaissance, his commitment to the</page><page sequence="20">146 French Studies universality of the pax romana. J. Ehrard, 'Montesquieu et les Gaulois', ib., 251-65, out of a handful of references scattered through M.'s work, conjures a brilliant and provocative synthesis, where they emerge from the shadow of the Frankish Conquest as a demonstration of its universal laws, and in their association in M.'s mind with the Greeks, also anticipate a libertarian myth which failed to crystallize. C. Beyer, 'Montesquieu et le pronom "je" dans VEsprit des lois\ ib., 221-34, describes M.'s 'tones', illustrating the friendly, didactic, polemical, and demonstrating the expression of allegiances in passages where his personal voice is absent. B. succeeds well in vindicating M.'s truly pedagogic spirit, but forgets M.'s blindness as an influence on style. T. Todorov, 'Droit naturel et formes de gouvernement dans UEsprit des lois\ Esprit, no. 3:35-48, offers an extremely salutary demonstration of the specificity and integrity of M.'s conceptual system, against modern relativist and empiricist annexations of him. T. achieves this by taking the components of the theory of society embodied in Book 1 apart, strikingly illuminating the application of principles of reciprocity and subordination. N. Hamp son, 'Montesquieu, Rousseau and the French Revolution', Studies in the 18th Century, 5:89-102, abandons, possibly in anticipation of the work reviewed above, the struggle to particularize the Revolution's debt to either, contenting himself by observing that they were poles apart, and that for the politicians their stance in relation to England was usually the deciding factor. R.'s thought still seems very tangled, and H.'s notes and references do not always tie in with his text. R. Leigh, 'Le theme de la justice dans les Lettres persanes\ CAIEF, 35:201-19, while revealing M.'s defence of this value against the threat of relativism, scepticism, and egocentrism, as its deepest unifying principle, emphasizes the practicality of his concern. Equally cogent and relevant, E. Mass, 'Le developpement textuel et les lectures contemporaines des Lettres persanes\ ib., 185-200, corrects some misconceptions relating to the publishing history and the reception of the work, by clearly differentiating between the two versions of the 1721 edition on the basis of some 500 variants. Significantly, it seemed to the general public a work on morals and criticism, not a novel. Jean Tarraube, Montesquieu auteur dramatique, Lettres Modernes, 1982, 55 pp., exhaustively studies the content, versification, and remarks of other scholars, in an effort to promote the minimal fragments of M.'s juvenile tragedy 'Britomare' to dramatic status. See also S. Mason under Prose Fiction: laclos. Domenico Felice, 'Montesquieu in Italia: bibliografia (1850-1981)', Studi jilosojki, 4, 1981 (1983): 249-86, is a thorough compilation, and an important adjunct to Rosso's work in the field.</page><page sequence="21">The Eighteenth Century 147 rousseau bibliography, biography. Etienne Brunet, Index des cLettres ecrites de la Montagne\ Geneva, Slatkine, iii + 345 pp., contains, in addition to the index, the transcript of a conversation between M. Launay and M. Butor on the uses of computer analyses of vocabulary, and an (occasionally fanciful) comparison by M.L. of J.-J.R. and Butor. Maurice Cranston, Jean-Jacques: The Early Life and Work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, 1J12-1754, Allen Lane, 382 pp., is a cogent and lucid presentation of the statements made in the Confessions and the correspondence, supplemented by generous borrowings from recent scholarly studies of the early works. Douglas G. Creighton, Jean Francois Deluc of Geneva and his Friendship with Jean-Jacques Rousseau (Romance Monographs, 42), Mississippi U.P., 1982, 127 pp., makes use of MS material to fill in details of D.'s life and activities not provided elsewhere. The roots of his friendship with R. lay, it seems, in their common devotion to Geneva and their shared outlook on moral questions, though their religious ideas differed sharply. A. Ridehalgh, 'Preromantic attitudes and the birth of a legend: French pilgrimages to Ermenonville 1778-1789', StV, 215, 1982:231-52, argues that the site of R.'s tomb was seen as the embodiment of his teachings in the Heloise and Emile, and it was there that the legend of R. the man of deep feeling, the unjustly persecuted outcast, grew up: a solid and well-documented article. Joel Dubosclard, Les Confessions (Coll. Profil d'une ceuvre, 82), Hatier, 79pp., draws heavily on the work of Raymond and Starobinski to present a concise if unadven turous synthesis. G. May, 'Les Confessions de Rousseau: roman picaresque?', Schalk Vol., pp. 236-53, reveals a number of instructive points of comparison with Gil Bias, but does not show that these are more than fortuitous. Huntingdon Williams, Rousseau and Romantic Autobiography, OUP, 252 pp., argues that R. 'attempts to construct his personal identity primarily in his own writing' and 'does not find himself ready-made in the texts of others' (p. 3), points made by R. himself; there follow a number of short 'explications de texte' which offer little that is interesting. G. Kelly,' "The Romance of Real Life": autobiography in Rousseau and William Godwin', Man and Nature, pp. 93-101, draws on the scattered fragments of G.'s autobiography to show that he was, in later years, very much akin to R. in outlook and temperament, his life dominated by 'reverie': a solid, well-argued piece. T. M. Kavanagh, 'Rousseau's Le Levite d'Ephraim: dream, text and synthesis', ECS, 16, no. 2 :141-1, seems the Levite as an example of R.'s obsessive preoccupation with victimization, as witnessed by his transformation of the Bible text into an account of his own persecution.</page><page sequence="22">148 French Studies THOUGHT AND INTELLECTUAL RELATIONSHIPS. Ronald Grimsley, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Harvester, 193 pp., considers R. the moral philosopher and exponent of a combination of reason and sensibility: students will find the treatment of e.g. Emile and La nouvelle Heloise very helpful, but will regret that space could not be found for the two Discours or the Essai sur Vorigine des Langues. Ernst Alt, Zum Entfrem dungsbegriff: der theoretische Ansatz bei Rousseau, Frankfurt, Lang, 197 pp., reviews the notion of alienation in ancient and modern writers, before concluding that R. is the source of all modern theories of alienation, including those of Marx and Hegel: the historical section of the study is more original, more useful than the assessment of R.'s writings. Nelly Wilson, 'Discourses on method and professions of faith: Rousseau's debt to Descartes', FS, 37, no. 2:157-67, regards the form and structure of the Profession de foi as much indebted to those of the Discours de la Methode, but assumes a greater degree of coherence in the latter than many recent commentators would allow; none the less, useful for showing that R. could not accept the Cartesian 'morale provisoire' which absolved the philosopher from religious and social responsibilities. L. Thielemann, ' The thousand lights and intertex tual rhapsody: Rousseau or Mme Dupin?', RR, 74, no. 3:316-29, argues, with some seeming justification, that the two Discours owe a lot to R.'s secretarial efforts in the preparation of the Ouvrage sur les femmes. Henri Gouhier, Rousseau et Voltaire: Portraits dans deux miroirs, Vrin, 408 pp., is an excellent and irreplaceable study of the personal relations of the two men from the 1730s until their death, taking in not only the biographical facts but the intellectual connections too. L. G. Crocker, 'Rousseau and Diderot: education as polities', Schalk Vol., pp. 29-46, claims that the two men share a belief in the conflict between natural and social man: R.'s solution is to promote the interests of all above those of the individual, whose staunch champion D. remains. This is a rather schematic study, which ignores some of the subtleties of their respective views. F. M. Barnard, 'National culture and political legitimacy: Herder and Rousseau', JHI, 44, no. 2:231-53, argues that, unlike R., H. sees natural man as a social being, whose perfectibility comes from his possessing the unique instrument of language. He sees no need for an outside legislator responsible for creating national consciousness, since the state develops not, as in R., from nature, but with it. M. O'Dea, 'The problem of expression in Rousseau, Wordsworth, Flaubert', CLS, 20, no. 3:283-304, argues that R. is caught in a 'Romantic' contradic tion, since he wishes both to tell the truth and to serve arbitrary, individual purposes, which require recourse to rhetorical strategies.

Trousson, 'Presence de Rousseau dans les romans de jeunesse de Balzac', DhS, 15:407-20, updates his Rousseau et sa fortune litteraire</page><page sequence="23">The Eighteenth Century 149 (1977), showing how much B. owed to R.'s ideas before turning against him. T. L'Aminot, 'Jean-Jacques Rousseau chez les surrealis tes', RHLF, 83, no. 1:65-80, traces the evolution of Surrealist attitudes to R., from initial hostility to apotheosis as the exalter of passions and dreams. Like so many others, they found in R. what they wanted to find. See also G. Benrekassa and N. Hampson, under montesquieu; and J.-P. Le Bouler, under mme dupin. voltaire correspondence, works, biography. The major publishing event in this area is undoubtedly the Corpus des notes marginales de Voltaire, 1.11, C, ed. Olga Golubieva, Berlin, Akademie, 895 pp.+ 20 plates. This instalment covers 166 works of Section 'C' (nos. 284-449) of the Leningrad catalogue, correcting its indications where necessary. V.'s marginalia on Dom Calmet, particularly the Commentaire litteral sur tous les livres de VAncien et du Nouveau Testament occupies about a third of the volume. It is perhaps superfluous to add that texts and all marginal marks, down to the last pen-stroke, are meticulously presented; and churlish to wish that the notes, where V.'s most significant points are followed through into some of the works and letters, were more extensive. The Provisional Table of Contents for the Complete Works of Voltaire I CEuvres completes de Voltaire, ed. Ulla Kolving, Oxford, The Voltaire Foundation, 118 pp., though appar ently modest by comparison, is potentially a very useful scholarly tool. From the revised version of Besterman's original project there emerges a chronological list of V.'s writings, of verse published in collected and selected editions, a Moland concordance, a list of verse incipits and of doubtfully attributed verse, and a title index. Moland has provided the form of titles given. O. Taylor, 'Voltaire et La Ligue: le projet de souscription ? note complementaire', StV, 212, 1982 :1-5, explains V.'s over-ambitious project of 1722 to bring out a luxury edition in Amsterdam, in terms of political pressures and possible anticipation of English subventions. G. Sheridan, 'Voltaire's Henriade: a history of the "subscriber" edition, 172&amp;-41', StV, 215, 1982:77-89, provides a publishing history of the quarto editions appearing during this interval. Her main finding is that V. himself was a party to the distinctive 1733 'harlequin' version. E. Lize, 'Voltaire et Les Sermons de m. Yorik\ ib., 99-100, brings the number of V.'s contributions to the Gazette litteraire de VEurope to 25, with the attribution to him of the review of Sterne's work appearing 28 March 1764. F. Blechet, 'Deux lettres inedites de l'abbe Bignon, biblio thecaire du roi, a Voltaire', StV, 208, 1982:315-22, presents B.'s acerbic acknowledgement of V.'s presentation to the Royal Library,</page><page sequence="24">150 French Studies of the counterfeit first French edition of La Henriade, and his subsequent refusal of a request to borrow English books. Light is shed incidentally on the use of 'permissions tacites', and the ongoing controversy over the provision of lending facilities. More intriguing in every sense is A. Magnan, 'Pour saluer "Pamela". Une ceuvre inconnue de Voltaire', DhS, 15:357-68, since his study argues the pernicious biographical effect of yet another Voltarian fraud. M. marshals the not unconvincing internal evidence, for identifying the mysterious 'Pamela' alluded to in the Lettres d3Alsace, with the actual Lettres de Prusse, and construing the latter, devoid as they are of many of the features of a genuine and intimate epistolary exchange, as revenge for the humiliations of Frankfurt. Vol. 8 of the * Conespondance (1765-67), Gallimard (Pleiade), xiv+ 1,663 pp. (see YWMLS, 43). A. Ages, 'Voltaire and the geography of philosophy: the testimony of the Correspondence', Schalk Vol., pp. 1-14, traces the contours of philo sophic prestige, in the sight of V., upon the European map reflected in the Correspondance. A naive exercise, in every sense, since the image of the sage rising above petty politics to discourse with such exalted spirits as Frederick of Prussia, is as unreliable as the verdict, that history invalidates the encomia heaped upon Germany and Russia, is unsurprising. E. Lize, 'Glanures voltairiennes', RHLF, 83:237-41, presents a brouillon by Mme du Chatelet shedding light on V.'s secret dealings with the French authorities when en route, in 1734, for Berlin; and a letter by V. of 1768, soliciting office for his friend, Damilaville. G. Menant-Artigas, 'Voltaire et les trois Bastide', RHLF, 83:29-44, solves the riddle of the identity of the 'Bastide', to whom V. attributed the Reflexions philosophiques sur la marche de nos idees, which heads L3Evangile dujour. Of the three possibilities known to V., it turns out to have been Bernard Louis Verlac de la Bastide, lawyer, and member of the interesting provincial Academy of Milhaud. The constructions which scholars erect upon such laboriously established fact are probably the real target of Jean-Michel Raynaud, Voltaire, soi-disant, vol. 1, Arouet, Lille U.P., 295 pp., though, inevitably, familiar images of V. disintegrate in consequence. The volume's composition and textual lay-out are presumably designed to prod the student into a creative and actively evaluative role, but the most positive comment to be made is that the method wastes a lot of paper. Who, after all, is to say, that the narrow band of short, unpunctuated quotations from established authorities, running continuously across the top of the pages, is less valid than the flippant authorial commentary inter spersed among packets of fragmented documentation on V.'s early life? These might have interest in their own right, but the format is unreadable; and, in any case, are we not implicitly admonished to eschew such activity, since to invent history is, as R. would have it, to</page><page sequence="25">The Eighteenth Century divert documents from their authentic semiotic function? D. Lenar don, 'Voltaire as seen through the Journal encyclopedique and the Annee Litter aire\ Colloque 76: Voltaire, ed. Robert L. Walters, London (Ontario), Univ. of Western Ontario, Department of French, 186 pp., pp. 59-82, is modest, conventional and rewarding. L. skilfully presents these ideologically opposed journals, as witnesses of V.'s literary, particularly theatrical activity, and reveals surprising fea tures of their editorial stance. thought and influence. By far the most outstanding study to emerge is Henri Gouhier, Rousseau et Voltaire. Portraits dans deux miroirs, Vrin, 480 pp. Self-effacingly presented as purely consultative, since its objective is the reconstruction of a relationship almost exclusively founded on written exchanges, which therefore necessitates 'in depth' philosophical and linguistic textual scrutiny, it is not merely immensely scrupulous but also gracefully written. While the study articulates itself around the recognized points of interchange and confrontation, the smallest clues are pursued to their biographical or creative point of origin, so that G. does largely succeed in rescuing from beneath the accumulated aura of two centuries' criticism the sharply defined features of mutual images, not necessarily accurate or valid, but acutely experienced by their subjects, and susceptible to abrupt or insidious modification. While V.'s reaction to R. is summarized as being the more complex ? R. is Judas, the unacceptable enigma, R.'s response to V. emerges as more startling, more humanly interesting and much less stable. Over and above the fascination of pride and sensibility in competition and confrontation, G. also illuminates from an angle, which although logically the most authentic, is, none the less, highly novel, the interpenetration of their thought and work, on a large and a minute scale. The mystery of R.'s reference, in the first Discours, to Arouet rather than Voltaire, is, for instance, at last dispelled. In all respects then, an indispensable book. J. Sareil, 'Voltaire polemiste ou l'art dans la mauvaise foi', DhS, 15:345-56, after dangling one or two red herrings and much inflated regurgita tion of critical platitudes, does give some substance to his title with a parallel between Pascal's technique in the Provinciates and V. J. Enhorn, 'La medecine dans la lutte philosophique de Voltaire', Colloque 76: Voltaire, pp. 95-115, attempts, with an amply documented account of V.'s interest in the origins, treatment and control of endemic diseases, and of his offensive against astrology and quackery, to dispel the misconception that his attention was motivated by hypochondria. O. Taylor, 'Voltaire iconoclast: an introduction to Le Temple du Gout, StV, 212, 1982:7-81, offers another extremely rewarding and scholarly study, illuminating besides his immediate subject, the whole texture and climate of cultural discussion in the</page><page sequence="26">152 French Studies 1730s. The social milieu from which the text emerged, its precursors and models, the conditions of composition and publication, its reception and bibliographical fortunes are all charted, and, of course, its scope, content, and doctrines meticulously analysed. The aesthe tics and norms revealed are less than surprising in their conservatism, but V.'s aptitude in fields other than literary needs exploration, and the skilful evaluation which it here receives. Even in more familiar territory, the commentary is never dull, thanks to T.'s constant attention to context and perspective, and his tireless selection of telling detail. J. Pappas, 'Voltaire et le luxe: une mise au point', Colloque 76: Voltaire, pp. 83-94, pursues the topic beyond Morize, and shows, convincingly, how, after 1749, the Rousseauist thesis of a 'natural' life plays a bigger role in V.'s writing than is commonly assumed. Mention of Colbert, the physiocrats and the patriarchal hue of V.'s social conscience should, however, remind us of an alternative model ? the great English landowner. M. Clive, 'La vingt-cinquieme lettre des Lettres philosophiques de Voltaire sur les Pensees de M. Pascal', RMM, 88:356-84, conducts her investigation in the light of a specialized philosophical, rather than a literary-historical back ground, which produces some valuable insights, but also strange misconceptions and the application of anachronistic yardsticks. There is no doubt some value in a meticulous collation of V.'s criticism with P.'s text, but this is undermined by an integral interpretation of the Pensees which is avowedly her own. Can one also solve the enigma of Letter 25, by assuming that the work was conceived by V. in an English context, and with an English readership in mind? R. Walters, 'La Metaphysique de Newton et les premiers contes de Voltaire', Colloque 76: Voltaire, pp. 155-71, follow ing V.'s progression as critic from Cartesianism to atheism, is mainly concerned with shifts of emphasis in the scientific works, until, between 1741 and 1756, the focus of interrogation becomes metaphysics. Refreshingly untrodden ground is explored by M. Carozzi, 'Voltaire's geological observations in Les singularites de la nature', StV, 215, 1982:101-19, which is stimulating, if only for the insight given into V.'s involvement in his regional environment. Judged from a scientific standpoint, although geologically unim peachable, her attempt to rehabilitate (against Buffon) V.'s later work on freshwater fossils fails because it is blatantly tendentious. V.'s obstinate scepticism and the narrowness of his vision do not nullify Buffon's application of imagination and an analogical method to solving the problem of geological formations, even though his conclusions were almost as faulty as V.'s. D. Adams, 'Voltaire's supposed debt to Boulanger', BJECS, 6:51-54, presents a piece of neat detective work, demonstrating against I. O. Wade, but using</page><page sequence="27">The Eighteenth Century 153 bibliographical sources that W. claimed as evidence, that B. was not, and on theoretical grounds, could not have been, V.'s authority for the view of the Chinese monarchy contained in the Philosophie de I'histoire. J.-M. Moureaux, 'Ordre et desordre dans Le Dictionnaire philosophique\ Colloque 76: Voltaire, pp. 29-58, offers a solid attempt to reveal its 'idees forces', by addressing himself to the substance of V.'s criticism of Judeo-Christianity, which occupies three-fifths of its length. J. Hellegouarc'h, 'Les Aveugles juges des couleurs: interpretation et essai de datation', StV, 215, 1982:91-97, argues plausibly that composition dated from 1738, and that this chapter of the Philosophe ignorant represents the transposition of V.'s scientific and personal polemic with pere Castel, and more generally, his counter-offensive against anti-Newtonians at large. R. Mortier, 'Voltaire et La Bible ou les ruses du polemiste', Colloque 76: Voltaire, pp. 17-28, contrives through a study of the notes and variants of the Examen important de milord Bolingbroke, to reveal the imperative of immediate topical concern, rather than genuine historical curiosity, as the source of V.'s later obsession with biblical criticism. His parallel attempt to clear V. of the charge of anti-Semitism by conflating it with anti-Christianism is unconvincing (and unworthy), because of his limited documenta tion. William H. Trapnell, Christ and His 'Associates' in Voltairian Polemic. An Assault on the Trinity and the Two Natures (Stanford French and Italian Studies, 26), Saratoga, Anma Libri, 1982, 268pp., fails for similar reasons, but on a grander scale. The conception behind his study is defective, in that his long introductory account (93 pp.) of biblical texts and patristic authorities tracing the evolution of Trinitarian doctrine, has little or no bearing upon the much slighter Voltairian corpus, overwhelmingly anti-Christological in nature; the post-Medieval sources which might count receive only eleven pages. In the ensuing search for the historical V., we are treated to bald speculation on such matters as the impact of Jesuit indoctrination, and a range of textual investigation which inexplicably omits items like LTngenu and the article Trinite in the Kehl edition of the Dictionnairephilosophique. T.'s definitions are also questionable: Clarke was a Latitudinarian, but was he strictly a Unitarian, and more so Newton (p. 254)? Finally, T.'s thesis, that V.'s assault on Christ and the Trinity was the most destructive event in the war against theology, is surely hyperbolic. N. Liu, 'Dimitrie Cantemir, prince philosophe de Moldavie. Echos europeens', DhS, 15:421-39, reveals V.'s use of C. as a figure and source for his historical works, and the impact of the correspondence with C.'s son, Antioch, upon textual modifications. J. Sareil, 'Le massacre de Voltaire dans les manuels scolaires', StV, 212, 1982:83-161, is correct, but entirely unoriginal in his discovery, established by means of a prolix, repetitious scrutiny of manuals up to</page><page sequence="28">i54 French Studies 1968, that they serve the market and the examinations system and perpetuate an outdated conception of literature. *Les Voltairiens, 2nd series.

Mario Mormile, Voltaire linguiste et la question des auteurs classiques, Ro, Bulzoni, 1982, 149 pp., offers much more than an introduction to and evaluation of V.'s Commentaires, and his interven tions after 1746 in the perennial deliberations of the Academy over the use of illustrative quotations in their Dictionnaire. Through these he is presented as a stabilizing influence: rather than a literary critic, a grammarian of purist, but innovatory tendencies. The bulk of the work provides a lucid, rationally ordered account of the genesis of the notion 'classic', and secondarily, 'classical writer' out of the tensions between 17th-century grammarians over standards of usage, followed by the Academy's perplexity over neologisms. The scope of the august institution's work, the interrelation of the great dictionaries, the eventual birth of the discipline of the commentary are all illuminated in the process. A well-conducted, thought-provoking synthesis of research in different fields. W. Pabst, 'Newton-Spuren in La Henriade", Schalk Vol., pp. 261-78, relates the progress of V.'s assimilation of Newtonianism in a very thorough fashion, to the elaborations and authorial annotation undergone by the poem, particularly those for the projected Russian edition (1736-40). C. Fleischauer, 'Voltaire poete: citations et adaptations', Colloque 76: Voltaire, pp. 117-40, incorporates a statistical analysis into his study of V.'s borrowing habits. Italy emerges as the predominant source, and V. as fairly loyal, in view of the radically different norms of poetic creativity. J. Sareil, 'Le rythme comique, acceleration et ralentissement dans les Contes de Voltaire', ib., pp. 141-54, covers much all too familiar ground, really offering only a different mode of describing the devices of irony and narrative structure. J. Macary, 'Statut des personnages dans Micromegas et Candida, ib., pp. 173-82, strives, through a sharp and stimulating dissection of the autonomy of characters relative to the narrating voice, to elevate some above the level of marionettes. R. J. Howells, 'Telemaque et Zadig: apports et rapports', StV, 215, 1982:63-75, examines thematic and structural parallels, in a rap prochement which strikes one as ingenious overall but banal in its detail. R. Francis, 'Prevost's Cleveland and Voltaire's Candideib., 208, 1982:295-303, mounts another comparative exercise prompted by similarity of plot. This helps to bring Clevelandmore clearly into focus, but doubts survive regarding the value of such a study, given pronounced differences in weight and creative imagination between the subjects. P. Lecoq, 'Un apologue de l'eternel seisme: Candide', IL, 35:77?78, in pithy style, presents a novel angle on the conte's vigilantly</page><page sequence="29">The Eighteenth Century !55 creative decomposition of experience, and finds the process reflected in the Conespondance of 1753-59. E. Branco Pinto Leal, 'Le(s) jeu(x) narratif(s) dans Candide de Voltaire5, Ariane, 2:69-92, much suppor ted by Todorov, elaborates a clear and helpful analysis of the micro and macros tructures of the work, but attaches to it a largely unrelated interpretation, where commonplaces on Genesis rub shoulders with sweeping generalizations on the symbolism of bourgeois expansion ism, and fanciful etymological conjecture. C. Mervaud, 'Sur l'activite ludique de Voltaire conteur: le probleme de L'lnge'nu', 1L, 35:13-17, is to be taken much more literally, in that, reminding us of the origin of some of the contes as 'amusements de societe', she sets out to explore the range of devices used by V. to subvert a world of stable meanings in the most serious and militant of his inventions. Though derivative, C. provides a useful summary of techniques and critical references. In some respects, the most stimulating, though not necessarily the most substantial item in this section, comprises a group of short articles directed at R. S. Wolper5s recent controversial readings of the Contes. T. Braun, 'Voltaire and his contes: a review essay on interpretations offered by Roy S. Wolper5, StV, 212, 1982:311-17, and Id., 'Theodore Braun replies5, ib., 328-29, set out the case for W.5s integral approach to the stories, as 'pure literature5. His reply, addressed to V. Mylne, 'Wolper5s view of Voltaire's tales5, ib., 318-27, tends to confirm one of the salient points of her criticism: weakness in scholarship. Her judicious but penetrating examination reveals the confusions behind W.5s strictures on conventional methodology, and the distortions that neglect of relevant critical background engenders. H. Stavan, 'Are Voltaire's tales narrative fantasies? A reply to Wolper', ib., 215, 1982:281-87, also comes to the defence of the traditional mode, but, owing to a logical flaw in his own procedures, tends to be counter productive. While it may be critically acute to highlight V.'s use in the tales of the 'jargon of connivance', proof of involvement with a readership and controversial issues, to claim that the reappearance of catchphrases in subsequent correspondence demonstrates his cons cious adoption of a role in the fiction is simply inept. 3. Prose Fiction ? General Raymonde Gobert, Le Conte de fees litteraire en France de la fin du XVHe a la fin du XVIIIE siecle, Nancy U.P., 1982, 509 pp., modifies Propp's definition of the fairy story as essentially the account of a 'mefait' to emphasize in addition the reparation of the misdeed, the exemplary character of the heroic couple, and the setting up of an 'ordre feerique' as a microcosm of a new world-order: the conte de fees thus becomes, it is argued, the expression of the collective wishes and needs of its</page><page sequence="30">156 French Studies writers and readers. This is a highly rewarding study which, however, gets into something of a tangle in trying to work out Diderot's role in the writing of VOiseau blanc (pp. 250-53). Hans-Jurgen Lusebrink, Kriminalitat und Literatur im Frankreich des 18. Jahrhunderts, Munich, Oldenbourg, xii 4- 306 pp., is a detailed and thorough examination of contemporary reactions to the career and final removal from the scene of four criminals, Cartouche, Mandrin, Damiens, and Desrues. L. shows that reactions to their deeds, and the use of their lives as examples, percolated not only into popular literature, but into dissertations submitted for provincial academy prizes as well. The comments which they inspired masked direct criticism of the Ancien Regime, pointing up the dissatisfaction with the existing legal framework, and with absolutism, long before 1789. H.-G. Funk, 'Geschichte des Gattungsbezeichnungen der literarischen Utopie in Frankreich im 17. und 18. Jahrhundert', Schalk Vol., pp. 75-107, provides a detailed account of the (usually contemptuous) reception given in 18th-century France to Utopian writing, which was generally assimilated to existing genres and ill served by the inadequacies of the literary classifications then in use. Simon Davies, Paris and the Provinces in Eighteenth-Century Prose Fiction (StV, 214), 1982, 138 pp., argues that, after 1760, Paris becomes the centre for moral commentary rather than merely a conventional setting for novels; this is adequately shown, but the case would have been strengthened by some consideration of the ways in which the presentation of the physical appearance of the city changes as the century wears on. P. Frantz, 'Travestis poissards', RSH, 190:7-20, argues that 'poissard' texts of the 18th and 19th centuries are literary in their conventions and allusions, despite their apparently popular language. Clifton Cher pack, Logos in Mythos. Ideas and Early French Narrative (French Forum Monographs, 46), Lexington, Kentucky, French Forum, 212 pp., covers a wide variety of major and minor novelists grouped in broad chapters on the Romance, archaeological voyages, imaginary voyages and 'sex and ideas', testing them for congruence between the ideas expressed and the behaviour of the characters. Unfortunately, the critical opinions deployed are frequently second-hand, and his test, mechanically applied, is not necessarily central to the issue of success or failure, since it overlooks the primary requisite of human credibility. Lettres portugaises, Lettres d'une peruvienne et autres romans d'amour par lettres, ed. Bernard Bray and Isabelle Landy-Houillon, Flammarion, 403 pp., offers an excellent critical anthology of com plete texts in this inexpensive collection.

Didier, fcLa nourriture dans les romans dTsabelle de Charriere', DhS, 15:189/-97, does what can be done with such thin material, arguing that C. does distinguish male and female diet, but does not necessarily write about women from a female point of view, since she is obliged to use a language fashioned by men. crebillon fils. P. Hoffmann, 'Systeme de la seduction chez Crebillon Fils', Schalk Vol., pp. 136-51, goes over familiar ground, and is sometimes over-subtle in arriving at the conclusion that libertinage is an inevitably unsuccessful attempt to combine a spiritual theory of love and the mechanical pursuit of pleasure. La Nuitet le moment, ed. H. Coulet, Desjonqueres, xvi + 262 pp. dorat. Les Malheurs de Vlnconstance, preface d'Alain Clerval, Desjonquieres, xv + 349pp., makes an inaccessible text readily available, though the introduction will suit only the general reader. mme de graffigny. L. Schrader, 'Die "bonne sauvage" als Franzosin', Schalk Vol., pp. 313-35, shows that the adverse comments on France made in the Lettres d}une Peruvienne do not impair the appreciation of its superiority over Peru, the exotic qualities of which are seen through unmistakably western eyes. laclos. Laclos et le Libertinage 1782-1 982, Actes du Colloque du Bicentenaire des Liaisons dangereuses3, PUF, 327 pp., groups together 21 papers by scholars from various countries, and of various quality. Several contributions deal with the libertine tradition: W. Perkins, 'Le libertinage de quelques poetes epicuriens a la fin du XVIIe siecle' (pp. 21-46), shows that, well into the 18th century, hedonism had a strongly Christian basis, though the scope of the enquiry regrettably leaves aside the overtly licentious verse of e.g. Voltaire and J.-B. Rousseau. A. Siemek, 'Crebillon precurseur de Laclos?', ib., pp. 47-61, is less satisfactory in its detailed treatment of C. than Id., La Recherche morale et esthetique dans le roman de Crebillon fils (see YWMLS, 44:168), since it tries too hard to place the distinction between C. and L. in the failure of any of the former's characters to remain superior to those whom they manipulate, though one can more readily accept C. as a forerunner of L. in his questioning of received moral values. S. Mason, 'Montesquieu et les debuts du gout</page><page sequence="32">i58 French Studies libertin', ib., pp. 63-74, makes out a good case for M. as a critic of the dissoluteness of his contemporaries. T. S. Dock, 'Du libertinage dans YEncyclopedic?', ib., pp. 75-86, has a hard time finding much to talk about, and succeeds only in showing that Jaucourt's concern for decency informs a good many of his contributions. J. Rousset, 'Les lecteurs indiscrets', ib., pp. 89-96, argues ? not very convincingly ? that L. uses the techniques of earlier epistolary novels to put an end to the genre, as though no other causes could be found. B. Bray, 'L'hypocrisie du libertin', ib., 97-109, as its title indicates, knocks on an open door. D. Massieu, 'Le narrataire des Liaisons dangereuses', ib., pp. 111-35, is a clear-headed study of the role(s) of the reader, which uses recent critical jargon without abusing it. M. Delon, 'Le discours italique dans Les Liaisons dangereuses'', ib., pp. 137-50, is an intelligent study of the typographical devices which enable L. to set the libertins apart from the values and inadequacies of their victims. A.-M. Jaton, 'Libertinage feminin, libertinage dangereux', ib., pp. 150-62, outlines the scarcely original view that Merteuil's attitudes call in question the superiority of the male. J.-M. Goulemot, 'Le lecteur-voyeur et la mise en scene de l'imaginaire viril dans Les Liaisons dangereuses', ib., pp. 163-75, is a solid examination of the female character as it emerges from the novel. H. Coulet, 'L'espace et le temps du libertinage dans Les Liaisons dangereuses', ib., pp. 177-89, sees the libertins as no more successful than their victims in using time to their advantage. J. Biou, 'Une lettre au-dessus de tout soupcon', ib., pp. 191-98, is an extended commentary on Letter 48, snowing its significance both in its context and in the work as a whole. C. Belcikowski Ta Minh, 'L'idee du bizarre dans Les Liaisons dangereuses', ib., pp. 199-206, sees the bizarre as evidence of a civilization in decline. The remaining articles concern the influence of the novel: J. Gillet, 'Laclos, la legende noire et le preromantisme', ib., pp. 20CJ-18, and E. Lehouck,6Les Liaisons dangereuses et le masque romantique', ib., pp. 219-31, draw attention to the role of the seducer in later novels and plays. J.-L. Seylaz, 'Stendhal lecteur de Laclos', ib., pp. 232-42, claims that S. saw in the novel the confirmation of his own belief in the power of love. R. Fleck, 'Reception, traductions, influence de Laclos dans les pays de langue allemande', ib., pp. 243-53, reveals the often surprising fate of the novel in translation. S. Davies, 'Laclos dans la litterature anglaise du XIXe siecle', ib., pp. 255-64, presents cogent reasons for believing that L. greatly influenced the novels of Swinburne. R. Beziau, 'Une imitation des Liaisons dangereuses en 1843: Georges et Cecile de Paul Gaschon de Molenes', ib., pp. 265-74, is more a work of exhumation than of resurrection. C. Crossley, 'Laclos et l'image du XVIHe siecle francais en Angleterre (1870-1930)', ib., pp. 275-87, shows that Huxley, Lawrence etal. were much taken with</page><page sequence="33">The Eighteenth Century 159 L., who seemed to be describing many of the defects of their own society. J. Bessiere, 'Andre Pieyre de Mandiargues et la genealogie du libertinage', ib., pp. 289-309, does not get around to dealing with L.'s novel. L. Versini, 'Laclos hier, aujourd'hui et demain', ib., pp. 311-24, rounds off the volume with suggestions for further research. C. Rosso, 'Da Thomas a Laclos: ideologia e sociologia nel discorso sulla donna', SF, 27, no. 1:29-43, *s a flatulent study which argues that T. and L. were alike in drawing attention to the inferior role of women, and that the latter's writings on women are not an extension of his novel, but a break with it. R. Bary, 'Mme de Merteuil et la critique du libertinage', DhS, 15:369-88, regards the lady as really an opponent of libertinage, the futility of which she exposes better than any other character in the book. lesage. M.-P. Laden, 'Lesage's Gil Bias: double imitation, duplicitous writing', DegSec, 83, no. 7:1-25, offers a pretentious but intermittently perceptive thesis that writing, of an imitative and calculated variety, is the key to the hero's personality and the sense of the novel. marivaux. J. Ehrard, 'Marivaux, romancier de Paris', Schalk Vol., pp. 64-74, is not much more than a list of references intended to show that the city is presented from an aesthetic, not a topographical, point of view. H. Coulet, 'L'inachevement dans les recits de Mari vaux', SRLF, 2:29-46, claims that the text is unfinished because M. was deeply disappointed with the society of his day, and because the texts are serial, not sequential, so that the reader supplies his own 'sense of an ending'. A more textual explanation is given by M.-P. Laden, 'The pitfalls of success: Jacob's evolution in Le Paysan parvenu', RR, 74, no. 2:170-82, who argues that the story is unfinished because J.'s mask hides his disintegrating personality. This thesis closely resembles that proposed in an article in FMLS in 1978 (see YWMLS, 40:155-56), which is nowhere cited. F. Abetti, ' "La honteuse neces site de devenir finesse" : the pathos of style in La Vie de Marianne', RR, 74, no. 2:183-201, believes that Marianne's narrative is intended to persuade, and that persuasion replaces truth in her story, to distort the sense of what goes on: a view spoilt by the inaccuracy of many of the details quoted to support it. A related idea is canvassed by M.-J. Brilhante, 'L'idee de construction dans La Vie de Marianne de Mari vaux', Ariane, 1:51-86, who argues, quite plausibly, that M. con structs her own character as the narrative proceeds. B. Braunrot, 'Le tome viii de La Vie de Marianne et la proscription des romans', RHL, 83, no. 3:442-45, shows that the publication, at the end of 1737, of Part 8 of the novel coincided with the clamp-down on fiction by the authorities, so that most of the edition was destroyed; two copies have now come to light, which show that the text was set up from M.'s MS.</page><page sequence="34">i6o French Studies marmontel. Michael Cardy, The Literary Doctrines of Jean-Francois Marmontel {StV, 210), 1982, 192 pp., is a careful and generally lucid study, from which M. emerges, to nobody's surprise, as the spokes man of many typical late 18th-century ideas on taste and genius, and in his belief in the decline of literary values in his own day. However, a reading of Book ix of his Memoires helps to dispel the idea that M. and his contemporaries were wholly opposed to 'unadulterated realism' (P- 153) mercier. C. Bruneteau and B. Cottret, ed., Parallele de Paris et de Londres (Coll. Etudes critiques, 2), Didier, 1982, 239pp., provide a copious introduction and notes to accompany a text which dates from about 1780, and which fully deserves to take its place alongside the Tableau de Paris. prevost. C. Lazzaro-Weis, 'Prevost's comic romance: the Doyen de Killerine\ Neophilologus, 67:517-24, proposes with considerable erudition and ingenuity, that problems of interpretation posed by the work may be resolved by abandoning the norms of realistic fiction, and setting it in the context of the revival of popularity enjoyed by Greek Romance in the 1730s. restif de la bretonne. C. Klein, 'Le role du dedoublement dans La Decouverte australe de Restif de la Bretonne', EDHS, 2, 1982:299-322, examines the text as a 'conte imaginaire', linking it ? sometimes rather tendentiously ? to the themes of innocence and nature in R.'s other works. C. Bertrand, 'Le Monument de Costume de Restif de la Bretonne', DhS, 15:389-406, sees this work as the key to R.'s later writing, with all his sexual obsessions in evidence in his commentaries. mme riccoboni. *Lettres de Milady Juliette Catesby, pref. S. Menant, Desjonqueres, x + 177 pp. sade. J. de Jean, 'Les 120 Journees de Sodome: disciplining the body of the narrator', RR, 74, no. 1 ^4-45, using the pun on 'compter/ conter', argues that S. often inhibits the narrative by his preoccupation with statistical detail; language thus becomes denotative, 'freezing' the violence of the action. In a fascinating textual excursus, de J. makes comparisons between S. and the 16th-century 'theatre of memory', but one is not quite persuaded that memory plays in his work the crucial role claimed for it. B. Bomel-Rainelli, 'Sade ou l'alimentation generate', DhS, 15:199-219, argues that, for S., food becomes a means of overcoming all taboos and that its transformation is to be explained in the light of his materialism. Sade: ecrire la crise. Colloque de Cerisy, ed. Michel Camus and Philippe Roger, Belfond, 302 pp., brings together 16 articles. Some writers seem bent on stretching critical ingenuity beyond even the limits usual in S. studies. B. Finke, 'Lecture alimentaire de l'Utopie sadienne' (pp. 175-91), J.</page><page sequence="35">The Eighteenth Century 161 Gillibert, 'L'emprise sadienne', ib., pp. 277-87, and J.-P. Faye, 'Juliette et le Pere Duchesne, Foutre', ib., pp. 289-302, all display an unrewarding determination to wring new meanings out of the text. Others rehash the analyses of S.'s peculiar ways which have repeatedly been conducted elsewhere: N. Chatelet, 'Le libertin a table', ib., pp. 67-82, J.-M. Goulemot, 'Beau Marquis, parlez-nous d'amour', ib., pp. 119-32, J. Ehrard, 'Pour une lecture non sadienne de Sade: mariage et demographie dans Aline et Valcour9, ib., pp. 241-59, and M. Camus, 'L'impasse mystique du Libertin', ib., pp. 259-76, despite their varied approaches, yield nothing substan tially new, any more than does P. Frantz, 'Sade, texte, theatralite', ib., pp. 193-217, who comes to the unsurprising conclusion that the plays lead in the same manic direction as everything else that S. wrote. Some contributors do, fortunately, break new ground: L. Finas, 'L'increvable feminin dans Faxelange ou les Torts de VAmbition9, ib., pp. 15-30, studies S.'s use of numbers; J. Proust, 'La diction sadienne; a propos de La Marquise de Gange9, ib., pp. 31-46, argues strongly in favour of S.'s authorship of the work; C. Thomas, Tsabelle de Baviere: derniere heroine de Sade', ib., pp. 47-66, is a hard-headed study of the presentation of the heroine. A. Pfersmann, 'L'ironie romantique chez Sade', ib., pp. 85-98, is an ingenious analysis of the authorial interventions which seem to call the proclaimed autonomy of the text into question; P. Roger, 'La trace de Fenelon', ib., pp. 149 73, sees in Aline et Valcour the refutation specifically of the human values of which S. took F. to be the defender; on a related theme, B. Didier, 'Sade theologien', ib., pp. 219-40, neatly demonstrates that S. used the language and presuppositions of Catholic theology in all his writings, while keeping his distance not only from the Church, but from the philosophes as well. J.-C. Bonnet, 'Sade historien', ib., pp. 133-48, argues that S.'s deep interest in historical facts did not prevent his transforming them to show that human beings were crushed under the oppressive weight of history. H.-U. Seifert, *Sade: Leser und Autor. Quellenstudien, Kommentare und Interpretationen zu Romanen und Romantheorie von D. A. F. de Sade (Studien und Dokumente zur Geschichte der romanischen Literaturen, 11), 461 pp. mme de tencin. Le Siege de Calais, preface de Pierre-Jean Remy, Desjonquieres, xxviii + 226 pp., has a useful biographical and histori cal introduction. 4.

Elsewhere, B. points to various examples of the dramatic use of the Gauls as vehicles for comedy and propaganda in 'Nos ancetres les Gaulois sur le theatre au XVIIIe siecle', Nos ancetres, p. 73. A. Sokalski, 'Le poete Mey et son double', StV, 212, 1982:163-81, offers an unusual piece of detective work on the historical identity of Mey, and the fortunes of his name in the epigrams of chansonniers, projecting him as a prototype of the ragged, mad, parasitical poet of literary works, and casting some light in passing upon the 'querelle des theatres'. individual authors beaumarchais. R. Niklaus, Le Mariage de Figaro, Critical Guides to French Texts, 21, 75 pp., stresses the theatricality of the work, and its emphasis on love. The study is something of a curate's egg, with excessive attention being devoted to resume, though it has the merit of seeing the play as a unity. chenier, m. j. J. Deprun, 'M.-J. Chenier et la legende de Fenelon', CRA C, 3:13-24, traces the genesis of Fenelon ou les Religieuses de Cambrai (1793), presenting it as a 'centrist' tragedy written against growing secular intolerance, with F. as the ideal republican hero. marivaux. H. Coulet, 'Le pouvoir politique dans les comedies de Marivaux', IL, 35, no. 5:190-95, concludes, after a general review of relationships between the social classes, that they matter less than those between individuals. As is often the case in studies of M., no attempt is made to see this idea in the light of the novels. The same objection can be urged against J.-P. Schneider, 'L'lle des Esclaves de Marivaux ou la balance egale', EDHS, 2:5-56, who similarly concludes that M. is more interested in the individual than in the mass of mankind. restif de la bretonne. B. Didier, 'Restif de la Bretonne et le jeu de l'acteur', RHT, 3:324-28, shows R. to have been a proponent of 'natural' acting, reflecting life on the other side of the footlights in a theatre in which moral preoccupations were to be uppermost. One cannot help feeling that R.'s ideas were more interesting than the turgid theatrical strivings which he bequeathed to the world. 5. poetry general Work in this area corresponds to the Januarian profile of the genre as a whole. W. Hempel, 'Der alte Mann und die Liebe. Bemerkungen zu</page><page sequence="37">The Eighteenth Century einem Motiv in der Lyrik des Ancien Regime5, Schalk Vol., pp. 108-35, completes an article in ZFSL, 93:25-43, by following his theme of the poetical treatment of love in old age through into the 18th century. Here he is primarily concerned with Anacreontism, its revival in the work of such as Francois Gacon under the stimulus of late 17th century erudition, and above all, its presence in the verse produced by the circles of the Temple, Sceaux, etc. Chaulieu and Voltaire receive the lion's share of attention, C.5s characteristic motif of amorousness as the redemption of old age being interestingly contrasted with V.5s prudish espousal of wisdom as an appropriate substitute, until, in the dotage of the century, Echouard-Lebrun turns up to rehabilitate the mode. W. Gershuny, 'Italian landscapes in French Preromantic poetry and gardens5, AJFS, 20:15-25, taking the homology of poetry and painting reiterated by contemporary aestheticians as his starting point, examines the presence of the precipices, torrents, and volca noes of pre-Romantic taste in Delille, Lezay-Marnesia, and Saint Lambert. J. Gury, 'Nos ancetres les Gaulois dans le decor pittoresque dans le dernier tiers du XVIHe siecle5, Nos ancetres, pp. 119-26, evokes a rather different landscape ? the encyclopedic and humanitarian vistas of the 'jardin anglais5, into which the Gauls eventually intrude; but challengingly suggests that Delille, Roucher, and Saint-Lambert cannot accommodate them because they are alien to the garden as a product of civilized culture. E. Guitton, 'Duclos, Roucher, Chateau briand et la cueillette du gui5, ib., pp. 127-38, poses the general problem of the sources of literary reconstructions through a solid, methodical scrutiny of the rite as depicted by D., R., and C, raising the question of their filiation with Pliny. A. Dore, 'Essai de bibliographic des chants et poemes maconniques de langue francaise au XVIIIe siecle5, Chroniques d'Histoire maqonnique, 31:54-75, offers an unusual and useful reference article, including also some 18th century histories and apologies, and several bibliographical gems. *Lectures de la poesie du XVIIIeme siecle: etudes de reception litteraire, ed. E. Guitton, J. Place, 200 pp. L. Missir, 'L'ascendance orientale des Chenier5, CRAC, 3:7-12, corrects several misconceptions relating to the oriental side of the Chenier pedigree. J.-D. Candaux, 'Marie Joseph Chenier, bibliophile5, ib., 25-41, provides an analysis of the posthumous sale catalogue, revealing, predictably, the preponder ance of classical texts, less so, the absence of interest in aesthetics or bibliography. individual authors chenier a.

This could be the earliest indication of C.'s own classification of his MSS, and certainly sheds some light upon their uncertain fortunes. G. Buisson, Tour reediter Andre Chenier: apports et ambiguites des etudes biographiques et textologiques', ib., 117-37, returns to the question of classification, urging Fabre's suggestion of variable criteria for different collections, and questioning the reliability of the Daunou inventory as a guide to authorial intentions. The value of recent biographical work in reversing Dimoff's negative legacy to scholar ship is also summarized. Y. Giraud, 'La recherche du rythme a travers les corrections d'Andre Chenier', corrects Pauphilet's asser tion that technical matters were of no interest to C. R. Carocci, 'Sens du comique, ironie et satire dans la poesie d'Andre Chenier', ib., 43 53, rescues some humour for C, finding it, not as C.'s own definitions might lead one to expect, in the Bucoliques, but above all in the indulgent irony of the Elegies, and the satirical invective of Iambes. F. Rauhaut, 'Cheniers Elegie "Et c'est Glycere" und ihre "Quellen" bei Properz und Horaz', ZFSL, 92, 1982:242-54, strives to demonstrate by its alleged descent from two Propertian elegies, that C.'s expressed preference in his poem for uncertainty and jealousy in love cannot, as Mauzi and Scarfe claim, epitomize his whole outlook; also illustrates his 'imitation inventrice', and his unRomantic stance. G. Renard, 'Madame de Bonneuil a l'epoque de sa liaison avec Andre Chenier', ib., 87-105, provides a family history of B., and an account of her menage in Paris. J.-P. Delbegue, 'Autour d'Aimee de Coigny', ib., 111-15, gives a brief but informative biography of the inspirer of La Jeune Captive and the future author of Alvare.</page></plain_text>
