LOTKA Where inheritance is regulated in accordance with the right of primogeniture, this selection operates to mark out a line of successive male generations of minimum duration - always from father to eldest surviving son. So far as I am aware, no official stamp has ever been placed upon a similar chain of generations traced always through the ' youngest surviving son. But there is no logical obstacle to our fixing our attention upon such a chain. We then see two perpetually diverging lines of descent, representing the two extremes between which successive generations of males are comprised-in-time. Evi- dently, a similar scheme can be developed for the female line of descent, from mother to daughter throughout; and though this lacks the legal background of the male line of descent, it is, from the standpoint of biology and of population statistics, if anything, of even greater interest than the corresponding scheme of the male line. A diagram will help to illustrate the matter, and will at the same time serve to bring into prominence questions that naturally arise. In Figure 1 the horizontal scale is a time scale of years. This scale is repeated at successive equal vertical intervals of 28.5 years, this being the mean length of one generation, reckoned from mother to daughter, in the United States, according to the statistics of the last census year, 1920. These successive horizontal scales are numbered on the left with the ordinal numerals 1, 2, . . . which denote that the scales so numbered have been assigned to the first, second, genera- tion, etc., respectively. The horizontal line at the top would similarly correspond to the zero generation. 305</page><page sequence="2">306 Human Biology The zero generation here contemplated is a batch or cohort of say 100,000 females all born on one day of the year zero, which, to give the matter a more concrete touch, has been designated as the year 1900. Their daughters are the first generation, their grand-daughters the second, and so on. Let us now consider over what portions of the successive time scales these generations will extend. Since the zero generation was all born on one day in the year zero, its members will all be ten years old at the same time, namely in the year ten(or 1910 on the scale of dates). About this time, that is, some time between their tenth and the fifteenth year, they will begin to reproduce, and they Fig. 1. will continue to do so until they are about fifty-five years old, that is, in the year fifty-five (1955). Thus the first generation will extend over a stretch from somewhere about ten to fifty-five on the time scale marked 1. (In the United States during the years 1917 to 1924, there occurred a total of over 5,000 births by mothers under fifteen years of age. The round figure ten will here be used, for convenience, as the extreme lower limit for the female reproductive period. The exact location of this limit is of no consequence for our argument, as will be seen in what follows.) When some of the members of the first generation are themselves ten years old, they in turn will begin to reproduce. This will first occur when the oldest of them are ten years old. But the oldest of them were born in the year ten; hence the reproduction of the first</page><page sequence="3">The Spread of Generations 307 generation, and the births in the second generation, will begin in the year twenty (1920). They will continue until the youngest of the first generation are fifty-five years old. But the youngest of the first generation were born in the year fifty-five. Hence reproduction in the first generation and births in the second, will extend to the year 110 (dated 2010). In the same way it is easily seen that the births in the third generation extend from the year thirty to the year 165, and so on. Evidently, we can mark off a triangular field, as shown, in our diagram, which contains the births in all the successive generations. Suppose, now, that we draw a vertical line through the year 2100 on the time Fig. 2. scale. This cuts through the base lines of the fourth to the twentieth generation. From this we should conclude that in the year 2100 there will be living, as contemporaries, members of the fourth to the twentieth generations (the latter beyond the limits of Fig. 1). We shall see presently that this conclusion must be modified materially in its quantitative aspect; but qualitatively it gives us a conception of the overlapping of generations. It is rather curious to reflect that living side by side with us may be persons who, as regards order of generation, stand to us in the relation of great-great-great-great-grand uncle or aunt for example, if we may be allowed to use the words uncle, aunt , in a somewhat extended sense. But let us proceed a little more cautiously now. Our diagram shows that some persons of such remote</page><page sequence="4">308 Human Biology generations would coexist with us. But how many? We have fixed extreme limits between which the successive generations must be comprised; but how are they distributed over these successive ranges? For the first generation the answer comes readily. These are the daughters of mothers of the zero generation who, themselves, were all born at the same time, namely t = 0, and who are therefore each of age t at time t. The curve representing the time distribution of births in the first generation is therefore simply the frequency distribution of births (daughters) classified according to the age of the mother, and corrected to include only those mothers of the zero generation who survive to the several ages of the reproductive period. The frequency distributions of births classified by the age of the mother are published by the United States Census Bureau in five year groups, so that their graph is a histogram, as shown on the right in Figure 2. By a suitable process of interpolation a smooth curve can be drawn to fit this histogram, as shown in the same diagram, on the left. The correction for survival is easily made by means of the data contained in the so- called life table. The figures for 1920, the last federal census year, have been used in the example here shown. For the second and the higher generations the construction of the distribution curve is not quite so simple, and it must suffice here to state results without exhibiting their derivation. It can be shown that the standard deviation of the frequency distribution of the second generation is y/2 times that of the first ; that of the nth generation is у/ n times that of the first; and a similar simple relation connects all the other characteristics (seminvariants) by means of which the frequency distributions of successive generations are defined. One result of this particular form, which the relation between successive generations takes, is that the frequency distribution of higher generations approaches more and more nearly to the normal, even though that for the first generation in actual fact departs very materially from the normal. This approach toward the normal distribution in successive generations is graphically exhibited in Figure 3, which is so drawn that a normal distribution appears as a straight line, the tangent of whose slope is numerically equal to the square of the corresponding standard deviation, i.e. to the ordinal number of the generation in question. It will be seen that the points (black) representing the actual distribu- tion in the first generation are rather widely scattered about a line of unit slope (that is, 45 degrees to the horizontal). Those for the second generation are more closely clustered about a line of slope 2; and those</page><page sequence="5">The Spread of Generations 309 APPROACH TO NORMAL DISTRIBUTION OF BIRTHS IN SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS Fig. 3.</page><page sequence="6">310 Human Biology for the fifth generation (shown by crosses) are quite closely arrayed about a straight line of slope 5. Instead of quoting numerical values of the higher characteristic constants of the successive generations, it will be more appropriate on the present occasion to exhibit the actual curves, drawn to scale. These are shown in Figure 4 for the first ten generations. And now we are able to make a number of observations which a mere knowledge of the extreme possible range of successive generations, as shown in Fig. 4. Figure 1, did not reveal. We note, first of all, that our frequency distribution curves thin out so greatly at both ends, that the draughts- man is unable to show any visible area of the frequency curves at all on the right and left, over a considerable part of the range which we had at first (Figure 1) staked out as the area within which births are comprised, for successive generations. As a matter of fact, of course, it will be recalled that well over ninety-nine per cent of all the cases included in a normal frequency curve are comprised within three standard deviations to the right and left of the mean, and this remains true for most unimodal distributions, even if they depart materially</page><page sequence="7">The Spread of Generations 311 from the normal. In the diagram Figure 4,- in addition to the extreme range - the triangular area within which all possible births are com- prised - there is also shown a more restricted area bounded on the right and left by curved lines, which have been spaced at each genera- tion three standard deviations on either side the mean. This area comprises practically all the births. Thus the actual range falls short of the extreme range staked out as a triangular area in Figure 1. This fact is also obvious when viewed from another angle. About one female in ten thousand per annum, under the age of fifteen years, becomes a mother of a daughter in the United States. But cases in which there is a succession running through two or more generations, in which mother, daughter, granddaughter, etc., are each born by her mother at the age of fifteen or under, must be so scarce as to be practi- cally non-existent. This, then, is another interpretation of the fact that the area of actual births falls short of the triangular area of the extreme possible range of births. We are now prepared to look a little more closely into a question that was touched upon above: namely, the number of coexisting generations. We shall have to revise our first estimate in the light of what has just been said: namely, that actual births do not occur right up to the limits of the triangular area. If we look again at the vertical line drawn through the year 2100 on the time scale (Fig. 4) and observe, this time, through how many of the frequency curves it cuts within the area bounded by the two curves that measure three standard deviations on either side the mean , we find that, according to this way of reading the diagram, only the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth generations will be reproducing at this time. A few possible stragglers from other generations (e.g., the fifth and the tenth) may be disregarded as negligible in the total. But this is an incomplete view of the situation. It is true that the generations mentioned will all be reproducing at the time t = 200 (date 2100). But their relative contributions to the total birthrate will be very unequal. Evidently the seventh generation will be contributing most, and the ninth very little. In fact, the contribu- tions of the four generations, (sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth) will be as shown in Table 1, the figures being computed on the basis that the initial births in the zero generation were 100,000. It will be seen that two hundred years after the birth of the zero generation, the seventh generation contributes 62 per cent of the total birthrate, the sixth only 12.5 per cent, and the ninth only 1.1 per cent. A little</page><page sequence="8">312 Human Biology later, of course, the ninth generation will be contributing more and the sixth less, a gradual shifting to later generations taking place.

The table also shows two columns of figures computed according to two formulae designated respectively as "Skew" and "Normal," the derivation of which must here be omitted. Only this explanation may.be given in passing, that both formulae represent approximations to which the actual figures will approach more and more nearly as we pass to later and later generations. It will be seen that even at the time of the seventh generation the "skew" formula represents quite</page><page sequence="9">The Spread of Generations 313 closely the actual figures. The interest of the second formula resides chiefly in the fact that it is the familiar normal frequency distribution. For high generations the two formulae become essentially coincidental; that is to say, as time goes on, the contributions of coexisting genera- tions approach the normal or Gaussian law. This is shown graphically in Figure 5, in which the solid curve represents the frequency curve Fig. 5. Frequency curve showing contributions of sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth generations to total birth rate, 200 years after birth of zero generation. The solid curve corresponds to the "skew" formula (see Table I), the broken curve to the "nor- mal." Only ordinates corresponding to integral values of abscissae have any concrete meaning. defined by the more exact skew formula for t - 200 years (date 2100), and the broken line represents the frequency curve defined by the normal or Gaussian law for the same epoch. It is, of course, under- stood that for the present problem only those ordinates of these distribution curves have a concrete meaning, for which ( n+j ), the ordinal number of a contributing generation, has an integral value. The ordinates for the values (n+j) = 6, 7, 8, 9 are drawn in the diagram.</page><page sequence="10">314 Human Biology The same relations are exhibited, perhaps still more plainly, in the diagram Figure 6, which represents the various relations in the form of a solid model. The frequency curves for the births in successive generations are represented as rising vertically from a floor plane, each curve being drawn in a plane parallel to the "back wall," the suc- cessive curves being spaced 28.5 years (the mean length of a genera- tion) apart. A cross section is drawn in the plane corresponding to the instant t = 200 years (date 2100), and at this cross section the corresponding frequency curve for the contribution of successive generations has been drawn, cutting the planes of the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth generations as shown. This curve, like that for the seventh generation itself, is approximately normal, and closer approach to the normal form would be found as higher and higher generations and later and later cross sections were taken. (The scale of ordinates in this drawing has, for convenience, been made more condensed than in Figure 5.) From Table 1 and Figures 4 and 6 it will be seen that, although a considerable number of generations may be existing together, only a few of these are actually represented in considerable proportions; the remainder contribute but little to the total. ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION: THE BIRTH-RATE CONSIDERED AS A SERIES OF WAVES We have, so far, regarded the total births at any point as built up of the births in successive coexisting generations. Thus the curve of total births appears as the sum, or resultant, of a series of overlap- ping waves of successively wider spread and flatter profile, as shown in Figures 4, 6, and 8. But there is an alternative way of regarding the matter. Without paying attention at all to separate generations, we can say that the birth-rate Bt at any particular instant t is the product of the number of persons of age a, times the rate of reproduction m(a) characteristic of age a, this product formed for all ages within the reproductive period, and totaled for all those ages. Now the persons who, at time t, are a years old, were born at time (t - a), when the number of births per annum was Bt~a . Of these a certain fraction s(a)Bt-a survive to age a. Thus the sum of the cross-products mentioned above will be a - 55 Bt-as(a)m(a' (1) a = 15</page><page sequence="11">The Spread of Generations 315 .S ^ "C S §0) Г _ «H ISO Г _ «H 2 A ® § «•S A si «•S si s tí ° о .2 S +3 Srb Д Й ? * Д s § * Я ® .2 м 43 л +3 „Н g о ф о ^ S.S й .2 'S -j te S -j 3 fe рз 1 g § g ьс ® 2м? ft Й м 2+3 Meo &amp; Meo g 8 &amp; О § g 2=3 § S 2 £ a&gt; «S ^ ЬС«~ 03 III OQ JH 2 g'jûfc t» Ö О 03 -• 3 -tf Ф œ О A d •S d ® *55 A О S 43 &lt;S ^ Si S З-5'Я &gt; c3 &gt; c3 О "S d « 3 fil-S .2 3 :&gt;, .2 ■gS'SÄ 3 :&gt;, 3 a „ œ ® „ ПЗ 'S g ? л ® •+* S л .s •+* о S Pi ПЗ CD чЗ ** J83 CD чЗ tf g S Ф оЗ Ф ¡3 © tí .JÛ a&gt; * ° _. g c'52 оЗ W -P « о tí О 'S » ..и h » «О Ф ft g . &gt; © 5 О ЙЛ s H § ^ °.S i О г, л £ г, &amp; Н.З ft</page><page sequence="12">316 Human Biology or, treating the age as a continuous variable J *55 15 Bt-a s(a)m(a)da (2) 15 This is an integral equation which defines the total birth-rate as a function of the time. For the sake of those readers who are interested in the mathematical treatment of biological problems I may briefly indicate at least the main features of its solution. This may be obtained simply enough by making the trial substitution, Bt = Kď* (3) so that Bt-a = Ker{t~a) = Kert-ra (4) Fig. 7.

Furthermore, it is easily seen that if rh r2 . . . are several roots of (6), then a solution of (2) is Bt = KxerS + К2ег*&lt; + • • • (7) It can be shown that there is only one real root, r0, and an infinite number of complex roots. These latter contribute oscillatory or wave components to the solution, since e(u + iv)t = eMř(cos vt + i sin vt). The computation of the course of the birth-rate by this method has been carried out on the basis of the same statistical material as we have made use of above. It was found that one aperiodic and the first three oscillatory components sufficed to give a very close approach to the curve of births computed by summing up successive generations. Fig. 8. The three oscillatory components are shown in Figure 7, and their resultant, after adding the aperiodic component, is shown in Figure 8, together with the curve (full line) obtained by summing coexisting successive generations of births. A DIGRESSION INTO INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS The fundamental life functions, so far as voluntary actions of the organism are concerned, are fairly summarized as the quest of food and mate, on the one hand, and the battle - be it fight or flight - with untoward influences, on the other. The organism must eat and propagate, and guard against being eaten or otherwise destroyed. These are the ends to which living organization is shaped; but in the case of man the organization extends far beyond the mere provision of bodily organs. Our whole industrial system is one greatly magnified</page><page sequence="14">318 Human Biology organization of artificial sense and motor organs and reproductive apparatus, without which it would be utterly impossible to maintain the life of the world's present human population. While these "artificial" organs differ more or less markedly from our natural organs in their mode of origin, and rather less in their characteristic structure, in function they fulfil identical rôles with our native organs of sense, motion and reproduction. (That machinery reproduces itself is a fact that seems to be rather commonly overlooked in text- book biology, though it must have been painfully apparent to Robin- son Crusoe. In the present state of civilization we can truthfully say: machina omnis ex machina .) There is one difference between our artificial aids to industry and our native equipment serving similar ends, which results in certain peculiar consequences. The duration of the natural body, as a going concern, has certain rather definite limits. These are not shared by our artificial equipment. A microscope may be antiquated in 200 years time, but it is still operative. An automobile, on the other hand, has an average operative duration of about seven years only. Out of this disparity between the duration of life of the natural body and that of its artificial accessories a variety of social and industrial problems arise. Where the life of the accessory exceeds that of the natural body, we run into legal problems to regulate inheritance; where the reverse is the case, we have the industrial problem of regu- lating replacement. The biometrie aspect of the problems of inherit- ance of property is an inviting subject for reflection, but cannot be dwelt on here. It is intended to indicate briefly a few points of interest in connection with the bearing of our present discussion upon industrial problems of replacement and allied matters. We will note, first of all, the mere fact that in the conduct of indus- trial affairs problems arise that are very similar in general character to the main problem from which we started out, the problem of the progeny of a population element. This is most easily seen by consider- ing an ideally simple case. Let us suppose that on January 1, 1900 a commercial enterprise is started, and that on this date a lot of 1,000 auto trucks is purchased for its operative equipment. In the course of operations this original stock (the zero generation) presently begins to give out, through accidents or wear and tear. We might plot a curve showing the number of trucks scrapped as time goes on, a curve of deaths, as it were. If the enterprise is conducted at a constant level, neither growing nor contracting, each car scrapped must be replaced</page><page sequence="15">The Spread of Generations 319 by a new car, so that in this case the curve of death of the zero genera- tion is also the birth curve of the "first" generation, and so on. If the enterprise is growing, the situation is somewhat more complicated in detail, but essentially similar in general character. In any case we shall have a succession of generations of trucks, and at any future time there will be coexisting a number of successive generations. In the first few years replacements will show more or less marked undula- tions, every seventh year, say, calling for specially heavy replacement budgets. But as time progresses the overlapping of successive waves causes these fluctuations to become less noticeable, and, finally, quite unobservable. From the point of view of practical operation this is, of course, a favorable circumstance. But there is another aspect of the comparison between the method or plan of "replacement" characteristic of the organic life cycle, on the one hand, and the usual plan followed in the replacement of industrial equipment. The plan followed by the living organism is a highly ingenious one, to speak in anthropomorphic idiom. It is the plan or method of the time fuse, which, in human artefacts, is a very recent innovation. When the germ of living matter, in any of its forms, is introduced into a suitably conditioned system containing the substances needed for organic growth, this germ does not proceed to grow indiscriminately, absorbing into itself all the available substance of the system. Such conduct would lead to a condition which we, in human affairs, are wont to speak of as the exhaustion of natural resources. What actually takes place is that one part of each germ grows into a mature organism, while another part (the gonad) is placed in reserve, and provided with a time-fuse so set, that about the time when the maternal organism advances towards the termina- tion of its career, the complementary gonad pulls the trigger that releases the time fuse, and the portion of the organic substance that had been held dormant in reserve now begins to grow. In conse- quence, organic growth, instead of proceeding explosively to the incorporation of all available substance into itself, proceeds at a measured pace, death keeping step, approximately, with birth, so that the material substance of the living world is kept in circulation, and continued life becomes possible, where otherwise we could expect only sporadic bursts followed by periods of exhaustion. Nature has here shown a wisdom beyond human wisdom. For we have scarcely, as yet, learnt thus to regulate consumption to keep pace with regeneration. Only in very recent times has thought</page><page sequence="16">320 Human Biology been given to the problem of the exhaustion of natural resources. In one direction, it is true, great success has been achieved: the leak in the circulation of organic nitrogen is rapidly being compensated by processes of "artificial" fixation. So much so, that some prophets are already warning us of overproduction in this field. But in almost all other respects we are continuing to consume our capital of natural resources, with little thought to the problem of its replacement, if indeed, replacement is possible at all on any scale that would be of material benefit. But the optimist has no difficulty in finding a basis of fact for his cheerful disregard of omens. For if we have been burning up our material supply of coal, the flare in which it has gone to the sky, has so lighted up our intellectual horizon that men have become like gods; nothing seems any longer impossible, and we press on, confident that, whenever we come to a bridge, we shall know how to cross.</page></plain_text>
