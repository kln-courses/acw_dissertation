Santley Department of Anthropology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA Abstract In 1979 I initiated a program of archaeological fieldwork in the Tuxtlas Mountains in southern Veracruz, Mexico. One of the working hypotheses guiding this research was that Matacapan, the principal archaeological site in the area, headed a political economy dominated by persons from the great central Mexican center of Teotihuacan. In this paper I present evidence characterizing the economy that Matacapan dominated during the Classic period. My conclusion is that there was significant variation in system organization through time. Findings from the Tuxtlas indicate that the Early Classic regional system was small scale and organized most likely as a bounded hierarchical economy. In contrast, a dendritic political economy developed in Middle Classic times, in which the production of ceramics and/or their contents for distribution beyond the local region was emphasized. The Late Classic system was smaller scale, with most production destined for local clienteles, but apparently it was more commercialized, resembling an interlocking central-place system in several respects. Since 1979 I have been involved in a program of archaeological fieldwork in the Tuxtlas mountains of southern Veracruz, Mex ico (see Figure 1). One of the working hypotheses guiding this research was that Matacapan, the principal archaeological site in the region, dominated a dendritic political economy. Previous research had shown that Middle Classic Matacapan maintained close contacts with the central Mexican center of Teotihuacan (Valenzuela 1945), and our more recent work strongly implied that the site supported a Teotihuacan enclave (Pool 1992; Sant ley 1989; Santley, Yarborough, and Hall 1987; Yarborough 1992). Fieldwork at Matacapan also demonstrated that the site was the center of a differentiated craft economy emphasizing the production of ceramic vessels (Arnold et al. 1993; Pool 1990; Pool and Santley 1992; Santley 1994; Santley, Ortiz Ceballos, and Pool 1987; Santley, Arnold, and Poor 1989). The high degree of craft specialization in and around Matacapan stands in marked contrast to that exhibited at other centers in Meso america that apparently had mainly ceremonial and/or admin istrative functions (Blanton 1978; Marcus 1976, 1983; Millón 1981; Sanders and Santley 1983; Sanders and Webster 1988). In this paper I present evidence to characterize the economy that Matacapan dominated in Classic times. First, I describe four models of regional economy, outlining major system attributes and their archaeological correlates. Second, I summa rize the archaeological information from the Tuxtlas region. These data involve findings from regional survey, evidence on craft production at the principal settlements and smaller sites, as well as information from the regions to which the craft goods were distributed. Third, data from the Tuxtlas case are evalu ated against expectations derived from the models of regional economy. The bulk of the evidence supports the proposition that Matacapan headed a dendritic economy during the Middle Classic period. In contrast, the Early Classic economy seems to have been organized as a bounded hierarchical central-place sys tern, while the Late Classic system may have been more com mercialized and regionally integrated, perhaps as an interlocking central-place system. The information upon which these conclusions are based derives from six seasons of excavation at Matacapan (Ortiz Ceballos and Santley 1988; Pool 1990, 1993; Santley 1979; Sant ley and Pool 1993; Santley, Kneebone, and Kerley 1985; Sant ley, Ortiz Ceballos, Arnold, Kerley, Kneebone, and Smyth 1985; Santley, Ortiz Ceballos, and Pool 1987; Santley, Yarborough, and Hall 1987; Santley et al. 1984, 1986; 1994). In addition, seven seasons of multistage surface survey were completed both at Matacapan and of a 400-km2 region around the site (Arnold and Santley 1993; Arnold et al. 1993; Pool 1990; Santley 1991a, 1992, 1994; Santley and Kneebone 1993; Santley et al. 1988, 1989, 1992). Finally, project personnel and other scientists car ried out various studies of the region's soil geography, clay uti lization for ceramics, Quaternary geology, pollen-deposition history, and ethnoarchaeology (Arnold 1991; Byrne and Horn 1989; Goman 1992; Killion 1987, 1992; Nelson 1987; Pool 1990; Pool and Santley 1992; Reinhardt 1991). MODELS OF REGIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION Economies are open systems that extract matter, energy, and information from their environments for use by human popu lations. Such systems consist of "a set of objects together with the relationships between the objects and their attributes" (Hall and Fagan 1956:18). The objects in an economic system are those activities and organizations which perform a role in the operation of an economy, whereas the relationships between the objects are the connections that hold the system together (Lloyd and Dicken 1972). In modern economies, farms, mines, facto 243</page><page sequence="2">244 Santley Figure 1. Map of Mesoamerica. ríes, shops, and offices are the objects, which are connected by flows of raw materials, finished and semifinished products, per sons, groups of persons, messages, and other items. The com ponents of all economic systems also have a physical expression (e.g., quarries, workshops, and roads), but these physical forms themselves are not the system. Rather, they are the material res idue, the artifacts of system organization in a spatial theater. Because each economic system has a particular structure, there is patterning in the way that residue distributes over a landscape. This patterning has material implications that can be detected in the archaeological record. Geographers, economists, and anthropologists have long been interested in modeling human economic behavior (Berry 1967; E. Johnson 1970; G. Johnson 1973, 1975; Losch 1954; C. Smith 1974, 1976a; Skinner 1964, 1965). Although there is con siderable variety in the way economic systems are organized, economies found in state-level societies generally fall into four classes based on the amount of commercialization present: (1) bounded hierarchical network systems; (2) interlocking central place systems; (3) solar central-place systems; and (4) dendritic central-place systems (see C. Smith [1976a, 1976b] for an extended discussion of this variability and the processes respon sible for its genesis). Bounded Hierarchical Network Systems Bounded hierarchical network systems are found in certain "advanced" chiefdoms, feudal states, and small patrimonial states (C. Smith 1976a). In bounded hierarchical network sys tems households or communities have links to a nodal center that allocates some specialties among them. Although two, sometimes three levels of central places define the central-place hierarchy, most food producers are aligned to one and only one economic center, which is generally not very large, and there is little interchange between separate systems, at least as far as basic goods are concerned. Such systems support limited num bers of specialists because most of the population is engaged in food production for its own consumption and is incapable of producing large surpluses. Thus, the size of the resident elite and the number of craft specialists present are generally quite small, and most specialized production is organized on the household</page><page sequence="3">Economy of ancient Matacapan 245 level. Due to these constraints, elites in bounded hierarchical network systems have little interest in dominating the special ized production of basic utilitarian goods. In Mesoamerica the Early Aztec period in the Basin of Mexico (Sanders et al. 1979) and Late Classic period in the Maya Lowlands (Adams and Smith 1981; Freidel 1981) are examples of economies that may have been organized in this fashion. Interlocking Central-Place Systems At the other end of the continuum are interlocking central-place systems. In interlocking central-place systems, rural markets are linked both to urban markets and to other rural markets. These linkages generate a fully commercialized system in which buy ers and sellers have access to goods produced on all levels in the marketing hierarchy. The structure of the system is best described as being organized as a network of hierarchical and horizontal relationships. Interlocking economies may be con trasted with bounded network, solar, and dendritic central-place systems where marketing principles are suppressed or system structure emphasizes a vertical pyramidal chain of relationships. Examples of interlocking central-place systems include much of the western world (Christaller 1966; Losch 1954; Lloyd and Dicken 1972), traditional China and Taiwan (Crissman 1976; Skinner 1964, 1965), parts of Latin America (C. Smith 1974, 1976b), and Uruk-period Mesopotamia (G. Johnson 1973, 1975). Because these systems require a substantial population living in a large number of centers connected by efficient trans port, interlocking central-place economies were probably not very common in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, although Michael Smith (1979) has argued that Late Aztec period central Mexico may have been organized in this fashion. In interlocking central-place systems trade and production opportunities proliferate. This stimulates the development of marketing hierarchies in which commercial relationships exist between centers on all levels in the hierarchy. Specialized mar keting facilities are present, which may take the form of special ized exchange places (i.e., marketplaces) or aggregations of shops and exchange loci in the same part of the settlement. Be cause information about supply and demand flows freely across a broad area, it is advantageous for producers and consumers to locate themselves at particular places on the landscape. On an undifferentiated geographic surface those places should be equidistant between two (K = 4) or three (K = 3) higher-order centers (where K refers to the number of settlements at a given level in the hierarchy served by a central place at the next high est order in the system). Marketing at different levels in the sys tem consequentially produces a nested spatial-hierarchical ordering of centers in which, under conditions of population packing, the distribution of lower-order centers around a higher order center is hexagonal in shape. This distribution is the most efficient shape for marketing areas, because it allows for the maximum amount of packing of central places consistent with the minimization of movement costs (Haggett 1965). All interlocking central-place systems studied thus far con tain a hierarchy of marketing centers. The spatial distribution of these centers is nested, and their population distribution is frequently rank size or log normal (Beckman 1958; Berry 1961). Since there are many marketing opportunities, wealth can be derived from control of a great variety of goods and services. As a result, the size of the resident elite is large, and elites are present on all levels in the central-place hierarchy. Higher-order centers in interlocking economies are generally urban settlements: that is, unusually large communities in which a substantial pro portion of their population obtain most of their livelihood from non-food-producing occupational specialties. Those occupations may be retail or wholesale oriented. These specialties in turn require a broad range of support industries, which produces very large central places. Because interlocking economies need large populations to function effectively, all of the systems dis cussed in the literature literally contain millions of participants. They also require the circulation of vast amounts of goods between nodes within the system. Therefore, transportation net works must be reasonably efficient so that all sectors of the sys tem are provided with essential goods and services. Solar Central-Place Systems Solar central-place systems are partially commercialized econ omies. They occur in situations where there is some permanent specialization in craft production but where demand is insuffi cient to support permanent resident traders or many craftsmen at each central place. Markets are therefore held periodically, with traders moving from place to place to meet their thresh old requirements. Although a market hierarchy does exist, the number of days that the market is held varies with the size of the center; larger communities may have markets every day, smaller places only once a week. Solar marketing systems are especially commonplace in Latin America (Appleby 1976; Bromley 1976; McBryde 1947; C. Smith 1975). They are also present on the fringes of interlocking central-place systems: for example, in the less densely settled parts of rural China (Skin ner 1964, 1965). In solar marketing systems urban centers are located in the middle of food-producing hinterlands, and all rural places are connected to only one highest-order center for marketing. The rank-size distribution of settlements is primate like: that is, the principal central place is very much larger than any other com munity in the system. Because the primate center expropriates many central-place functions, intermediate-level centers do not occur, and exchanges with lowest-order centers are administered by primate-center elites. Although specializations in the primate center may be highly developed, due to the need to support the large urban population, the kinds of commodities produced in the hinterland are generally restricted to simple handicrafts and agricultural products. The primate center thus has a monopoly over the exchange of goods in its hinterland. Both retail and wholesale exchanges occur, with the latter confined mainly to the primate center; however, wholesaling is not oriented gener ally to long-distance or export exchange. Elites in solar systems are confined generally to the primate center where they dominate both politics and the economy. Typ ically, there are great lifestyle differences between elites and commoners, and there are few members of the middle class, except in the top-ranking center. Solar central-place systems are administered economies, in the sense that elites use their polit ical influence to dominate commerce: hence the term political economy. "The essence of administered economies is that rural commodity prices are established by the urban market through competition among rural producers, while most urban commod ity prices are established by urban monopolies" (C. Smith 1976a:336). Thus, "By controlling who is to trade, and by pro</page><page sequence="4">246 Santley scribing when and where, administrators can keep close tabs on the economy" (C. Smith 1976a:335). Dendritic Central-Place Systems Bounded hierarchical, solar, and interlocking central-place sys tems have economies in which most exchanges occur within the boundaries of the political system. Dendritic central-place sys tems, in contrast, involve economies in which production for export and an emphasis on wholesaling, often to international markets, are the primary variables affecting system structure (English 1966; Hassig 1985; E. Johnson 1970; Kelley 1976; Mintz 1960; Santley 1986, 1991b; C. Smith 1975; Vance 1970). In all dendritic systems studied thus far, the primate center con tains an export industry, which dictates the location, function, and level of marketing activity in lower-level communities. Most economic connections in dendritic systems are vertical; lower order centers function as bulking places for raw materials shipped from the hinterland up the settlement hierarchy and as break-of-bulk places for the downward flow of specialized goods from the primate center. Rural sellers receive a low price for goods produced in the countryside, due to the peasant's lack of capital and underdeveloped transportation nets, a situation that greatly constrains the rural producer's marketing radius. Traders, on the other hand, have the capital to move goods in bulk. They also exchange goods produced in the primate cen ter, but because firms in the primate center totally dominate the marketing hinterland, city-produced goods are always more costly, which drains capital from rural areas and concentrates wealth in the hands of the urban elite. Dendritic mercantile systems are consequently monopolistic systems controlled by city-based elites who stipulate the terms of trade. Dendritic systems are also administered economies in the sense that regional economic elites frequently monopolize administrative offices directly or staff key positions with their clients. This leads to the incomplete development of second order centers and to a greater-than-expected number of lowest order centers whose primary function is production and bulking for exchange outside the local region. Therefore, they may be also termed political economies. Dendritic central-place systems often occur in situations where there are great variations in resource distribution and access to wealth derivative therefrom. They also occur in con texts where there are major differences in transport efficiency or access to transport nets, often in colonial systems or on their peripheries. Primate centers in dendritic central-place systems are thus typically located near deposits of some critical resource that is shipped beyond local system boundaries or along or at the terminus of a major trade route where goods are transported in bulk. Although production and bulking for export may not have been the original reason behind the founding of the pri mate center, they become overriding concerns with respect to the establishment of dependent communities and the structure of economic linkages after extralocal markets are tapped. Growth of the system is therefore from the top down rather than from the bottom up. Archaeological Correlates of System Economic Structure A summary of the major properties of these four models of economy is presented in Table 1. This characterization of sys tem attributes works well when one has available ethnographic or historical information on economic structure. The acquisition of appropriate data relevant to all of these variables, however, is a notoriously difficult task using solely the archaeological record. This problem is primarily due to the fact that the archae ological record of system economic structure is incomplete. Thus, for example, while the characterization of craft-production loci is a relatively straightforward task using the archaeologi cal record, definition of the number and level of commercial activities is much harder because marketing leaves few material residues. In this paper only information on the following char acteristics of system structure is considered: (1) regional settle ment patterns; (2) rank-size ordering; (3) patterns in the loci of craft specialization; and (4) variations in mode of craft pro duction. The archaeological correlates of these properties of regional economy are as follows. Based on the summaries provided above, in bounded hier archical network systems the settlement pattern should be aggre gated, with the growth of the system from the bottom up. These systems should be relatively small in size, and there should be little evidence of settlement-hierarchy development. The region should be split into a number of political entities in competition with one another, as reflected by aggregated settlement around centers of roughly equal size, or there should be only one small scale system. The rank-size distribution should be convex, if sev eral independent systems are present, or primate like, if the region contains only one center. Finally, most craft production should be oriented to local consumers residing within each pol ity, economies of scale should not be present, and most produc tion should be on the household industry level regardless of site type. In interlocking central-place systems the picture is more com plex. These economies are much larger in size, with a more uni form settlement distribution. The settlement hierarchy should be well developed, often with six or more levels present, and the distribution of centers of different sizes should be nested and exhibit interstitial placement. Although growth of the system may originally be from the bottom up, subsequent development should be from the top down as lower-order settlements are sit uated to allow maximum access to goods and services provided by the greatest number of higher-order centers. The rank-size distribution of larger sites should be log normal because of the presence of an economy of scale that is geared primarily to con sumers residing within the system. Craft specialization should be present at all levels within the system, except perhaps at the smallest settlements. This craft production should be differen tiated in two respects. First, specialization in different crafts should be present on different levels: for example, ceramic pro duction on all levels but with obsidian working only at the larg est sites. Second, mode of production for a particular craft should increase in scale and complexity on higher levels in the settlement hierarchy; evidence of manufactory, workshop, and household-industry production should occur exclusively on the highest level in the economy, with only workshop and household industry production occurring on progressively lower levels. Archaeologically, solar central-place systems resemble inter locking central-place systems in many respects, but there are several importance differences. Although the distribution of lower-order centers may be nested, there should be a great con trast (300% or more) between the size of the top-ranking cen ter and the second level in the site hierarchy, which produces a</page><page sequence="5">Economy of ancient Matacapan 247 Table 1.

Most specialized craft produc tion, however, is still for consumers who reside within the boundaries of the local economy. Consequently, there should be little exchange beyond the local system, and most craft pro duction on lower levels should involve household or workshop industries. Although some specialized production at the primate center may be for export, the primary craft dominating its econ omy should be different from those at lower-level centers, but its marketing hinterland still should be oriented largely to local consumers. Dendritic central-place systems comprise another form of economy dominated by primate centers. Here, the top-ranking center is again much larger than any other central place in the local system. However, the settlement pattern associated with centers should not be nested; instead it should be size sequen tial, with central places on lower ranks situated at successively greater distances from the primate center. These lower-ranking centers should control fan-shaped hinterlands from which goods or raw materials are extracted for exchange up the hierarchy to the primate center, or they should be located on major routes of transit out of the system. Therefore, system growth in den dritic central-place economies generally is from the top down, because of the export orientation of industries dominating the economy of the highest-ranking center. Moreover, because of the primate center's export orientation, most evidence of pro duction or bulking of rural products should be located there, while most production in the countryside should be on the sim pler levels. The largest-order industries, consequently, should be situated in the primate center, with household industries located mainly in rural areas. THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD FROM THE WESTERN TUXTLAS The Tuxtlas Mountains are an isolated chain of volcanoes located approximately 150 km southeast of the modern city of Veracruz, Mexico (see Figure 1). Archaeological research con ducted in the region indicates a prehistoric sequence that extends back to Early Formative times (Blom and LaFarge 1926-1927; Coe 1966; Santley 1991a; Santley, Ortiz Ceballos, and Pool 1987; Valenzuela 1945). The Formative period was a time of ini tial colonization by sedentary farmers and incipient sociocul</page><page sequence="6">248 Santley tural complexity. These populations were devastated by a series of volcanic eruptions from cones flanking Volcan San Martin, which interrupted the sequence and caused settlement reloca tions (Reinhardt 1991; Santley 1991a; Santley et al. 1984). The most substantial occupation in the western part of the region dates to the Classic period when a major center was established at Matacapan and a large number of sites were subsequently founded in its hinterland (Santley 1989, 1991a). The data pre sented below pertain mainly to ceramics production, the major focus of craft specialization in the Tuxtlas region. This evidence derives mainly from the Early, Middle, and Late Classic peri ods (a.d. 100-1000) (see Figure 2). Regional Settlement Patterns The settlement history of the region in Classic times begins with a small founding occupation (a.d. 100-300). Hamlets comprised the majority of all settlements occupied; however, centers accounted for an increasingly larger share of occupation with time. From late Middle to early Late Classic times (a.d. 300 800) approximately 85-92% of the population of the region resided in centers, with only 8-15% living in smaller settlements. In late Early, Middle, and early Late Classic times Matacapan was the largest center in the region, but in the late Late Classic the site of Ranchoapan took over many of its top-ranking central-place functions. In late Late Classic times (a.d. 800 1000) there was a slight decrease in the degree of urbanization, which corresponded with a major drop in regional population. Although the survey discovered few Postclassic sites (a.d. 1000 1500), all were centers. The Classic-period settlement system apparently grew from the top down. In late Early Classic times (a.d. 300-450) a major center covering 50 ha was established at Matacapan, which con tained 92% of the population of the region (see Figure 3).1 Although other sites were founded at this time, all were small hamlets. In the early Middle Classic (a.d. 450-550) total pop ulation grew dramatically (3,244%). Much of this growth took place at Matacapan (2,800%), but the population at sites in the countryside grew by an even more significant margin (5,312%). Many of these sites were established to the southwest of Mata capan near the Rio Catemaco or along one of its tributaries (see Figure 4). Total population levels rose to a maximum of nearly TUXTLAS REGION MAYA LOWLANDS 300 A.D.

Many Middle Classic sites were located near prime agricultural resources, while others were situated on major trade routes and break-of-bulk points attached to distri bution systems leading outside of the region (see Figure 5). The early Late Classic (a.d. 650-800) and late Late Classic (a.d. 800-1000) were time periods of regional population loss (to 40,000 and 16,500 persons, respectively) (see Figures 6 and 7). Most of this loss occurred at Matacapan, the region's principal center, which shrank from a high of 35,000 persons in the late Middle Classic to 23,000 and 1,200 persons in early Late Clas sic and late Late Classic times. The decline of Matacapan also coincided with an increase in the number of small centers and their location in two parts of the region, suggesting division of the area into two political entities. This development involved first a slight increase in total population living in small centers in the early Late Classic (from 11,000 to 13,000 persons) and later a nominal decline to 12,000 persons in the late Late Clas sic. Villages and hamlets also lost population throughout the period. The total population living in villages shank from 5,500 in late Middle Classic times to 2,700 and 1,000 in the early Late and late Middle Classic periods, respectively. The decline of population living in hamlets occurred later (from 1,900 persons in the early Late Classic to 1,400 persons in late Late Classic times). This patterning suggests a collapse phenomenon in which small centers initially buffered population loss but where the general process also proceeded from the top of the settlement hierarchy downward. Centers in Classic times also exhibited little tendency for interstitial placement.2 Although one small center, Santa Rosa Abata, was situated near Matacapan, most were located near the southern extreme of the survey area or in special locations 1 Site type was based on population, defined as a function of area and density of surface occupation. Area refers to the area in hectares covered by deposits of a specific occupation density, which varied on an ordinal scale from light (5-10 persons/ha) to light-to-moderate (11 25 persons/ha), moderate (26-50 persons/ha), and moderate-to-heavy or greater (51-100 persons/ha), based on the conversions discussed in Sanders et al. (1979). Thus, if a site contained two occupation areas each 1 ha in size, one with moderate surface refuse and the other with light occupation, maximum population was estimated as 60 persons. The lin ear relation between site area and site population from the Tuxtlas explained 86% of the variation in the sample, indicating that area is a very good predictor of population, with the remainder probably attrib utable to differences in occupation density (Santley 1991a). Placement in ranks in the settlement hierarchy was based on multimodality in site frequency incorporating the following population ranges: 5,000-35,000 persons (large centers); 900-3,000 persons (small centers); 451-700 per sons (large villages); 91-450 persons (small villages); and 1-90 persons (hamlets). In addition, centers always had complexes of public build ings, with large centers generally containing more than 100 mounds, sev eral of which were quite substantial in size. 2 Interstitial placement occurs when centers of a lower rank are sit uated between centers of a higher rank. On an isotropic plain the dis tances between communities are equal, but a differentiated topography often distorts the distribution of communities. Interlocking central-place systems often display this pattern.</page><page sequence="7">Economy of ancient Matacapan 249 N *=^=e S ^ SMALL CENTER £ LARGE VILLAGE # SMALL VILLAGE ■ HAMLET CONTOUR INTERVAL 100 METERS 0 12 3 4 KILOMETERS TUXTLAS REGION SURVEY GULF OF UEXICO Figure 3. Late Early Classic period settlement pattern. near Laguna Catemaco and on islands in the lake. In addition, third-order centers generally were not situated in between first and second-order centers. Rather, the pattern appears to have been one of decreasing rank with increasing distance from Matacapan. For example, the second-largest center in the region, Ranchoapan, was situated only 5.8 km west of Mata capan, while the third-largest center, Teotepec, was located 9 km to the east of the site (see Figures 8 and 9). Both of these cen ters were substantial sites; Ranchoapan covered 185-250 ha (depending on time period), while Teotepec, although smaller in size (27-85 ha), had 102 mounds, several groups of which were comparable in scale to the largest architectural complexes at Matacapan. This patterning is especially characteristic of the Middle Classic period, but it continues to define site distribu tions in the early Late Classic. A number of Middle Classic sites were also situated in spe cial locations or had special assemblages of artifacts at them. Several sites were located near Salto Eyipantla, the major water fall on the Rio Catemaco. The assemblages from these sites con tained large numbers of ground-stone celts with battered use edges. These celts also vary greatly in size; the larger specimens (15-20 cm in length) suggest heavy-duty activities such as tree felling and log trimming, while smaller ones (8-14 cm in length) indicate more detailed woodworking, implying that dugout canoe production was a major activity for the population that lived near the waterfall. Also, although occasionally one must traverse rapids below Salto Eyipantla, the Rio Catemaco is very navigable until it reaches the Rio San Juan, which ultimately empties into the Rio Papaloapan. Thus, the occupants of these sites may also have been engaged in shipping goods by canoe downstream as well as receiving goods moving along the water way in the other direction.</page><page sequence="8">250 Santley Transit from Laguna Catemaco to the Gulf of Mexico is the other major route out of the Tuxtlas Mountains. Three commu nities in this subregion are located in special locations: La Barra, Monte Pio, and a settlement group west of Laguna Sontecoma pan. La Barra and Monte Pio are situated on the Gulf Coast at the beginning of major lines of transit into the interior, while the settlement group west of Sontecomapan is located more or less equidistant between the two settlements on the coast and Teotepec, the major site on Laguna Catemaco. Both La Barra and Monte Pio contain major mound groups, indicating that they had central-place functions.3 These findings imply that Monte Pio and La Barro may have functioned as ports of entry and exit to and from the Tuxtlas, whereas the site group west of Laguna Sontecomapan may have operated as an overnight station from the coast to Laguna Catemaco. The Gulf Coast therefore would have provided the ceramic-production system based at Matacapan with a convenient means for distributing its goods longer distances. And, since changes in transport mode often require adjustments in lot size, alterations in packing tech nique, and shifts in routing, sites should have been founded at major break-of-bulk points for those reasons. Although not entirely conclusive, the evidence on regional settlement patterns supports the dendritic model. First, growth of the regional system appears to have been from the top down, with Matacapan established first and the distribution of later rural settlements determined mainly by the resource needs of that top-ranking center. Second, lesser-order centers were not interstitially placed. Rather, the pattern was one in which the largest centers were located fairly close to Matacapan, the region's major central place. This pattern is consistent with their potential function as places bulking goods from rural sites for distribution to central industries located at Matacapan as well as their possible function as break-of-bulk points for the down ward flow of goods from Matacapan to the countryside. Finally, the establishment of a number of sites at transport sensitive locations indicates that a concern with the movement of goods out of the region may have been a major factor behind the placement of some settlements. Rank-Size Ordering The rank-size rule is an empirical relationship in which the pop ulation of any community is equal to the population of the larg est or first-ranking community divided by the rank of the site in question (Zipf 1949). When plotted on a logarithmic scale, this relation takes the form of a downward-trending line. Set tlement systems that conform to this relationship are said to have a rank-size or log-normal distribution (Berry 1961). Two deviations from this rule are common. One is the primate dis tribution. A primate system is one in which one city dominates the settlement hierarchy and there is an absence of medium-sized centers. The resultant plot is thus markedly concave in config uration. The other irregularity is the convex distribution (G. Johnson 1977). Systems that display tendencies toward convex ity have a number of large centers of approximately the same size. Larger sites are thus smaller than expected and smaller sites larger, given the predictions of the rule, and when graphed, a convex plot is obtained. Rank-size distributions during the Classic period were dis tinctly primate like (see Figure 10). Most of all in the late Early Classic, Matacapan, the only center in the region, was 15 times the size of the next largest settlement, Site 123, a hamlet. Rank size distributions in later time periods were progressively less pri mate like. In the early Middle Classic Matacapan was seven times the size of the Rank 2 community, Ranchoapan. In the late Middle Classic this ratio increased to 8.36, but decreased in the early Late Classic to 5.01, reaching a low of 2.31 in the late Late Classic. The R2 values for these variables show similar patterning: in other words, settlement rank generally accounts for a larger share of the percentage of variation explained in population size through elapsed time. Average settlement size for centers exhibits the same pattern: 6,500 persons in the early Middle Classic, 5,700 persons in the late Middle Classic, 3,613 persons in the early Late Classic, and 1,700 persons in the late Late Classic (R2 = .9914; p &lt; .001). The one-sigma standard deviations associated with these means pattern similarly: 11,770 persons in the early Middle Classic, 11,000 persons in the late Middle Classic, 6,600 persons in the early Late Classic, and 1,900 persons in the late Late Classic (R2 = .9764; p &lt; .001). According to Vapnarsky (1968), primate systems are often defined by low indexes of closure and significant amounts of extrasystem interaction. In other words, the economy of the sys tem is geared for export beyond local boundaries, which con centrates commerce and population at the first-order center, thereby contributing heavily toward primacy. Rank-size distri butions in the Tuxtlas became increasingly more log normal through time, and there was a decrease in average center size as well as a decrease in range of population size, indicating that centers toward the end of the sequence had smaller populations but were more equal in size. As indicated above, primate rank size distributions typically describe settlement systems organized as dendritic or solar central-place economies, but the lack of interstitial placement of lesser-order centers suggests that the regional economy operated as a dendritic central-place system. The temporal tendency toward log normality implies the devel opment of a central-place system characterized by increasing commercialization, which is consistent with the tendency for smaller but more equally sized centers through time. This devel opment was associated with the abandonment of Matacapan, the region's major central place. Location of Ceramic-Production Sites Most of the goods produced by specialists during the Classic period in the Tuxtlas were utilitarian. The Tuxtlas surveys uncovered evidence of specialized ceramic production, obsid ian working, and figurine production. The manufacture of fig urines was largely confined to Matacapan, the region's principal central place. No area of the site yielded abundant evidence of specialized production, suggesting that figurine manufacture was a part-time endeavor. Obsidian working was a part of the normal domestic routine at most pre-Hispanic sites in the Tux tlas; however, several settlements, particularly Ranchoapan, 3 In the sample of Classic-period sites number of mounds covaried with site population (R2= .7801; p &lt; .01). Sites such as Matacapan and Teotepec were assumed to have important central-place functions, because of their large size and the great number of mounds present at them. These functions included political services, religious ceremonies, craft production, as well as other activities. La Barra and Monte Pio were much smaller sites but had a larger number of mounds than expected given the above relationship: hence, the characterization that they probably also had central-place functions.</page><page sequence="9">Economy of ancient Matacapan 251 •J LARGE CENTER ^ SMALL CENTER Q LARGE VILLAGE # SMALL VILLAGE ■ HAMLET CONTOUR INTERVAL 100 METERS 0 1 2 3 4 KILOMETERS TUXTLAS REGION SURVEY CULT OF MEXICO Figure 4. Early Middle Classic period settlement pattern. were more heavily involved in the production and use of pris matic blades. The most abundant corpus of information on specialized craft production pertains to ceramics manufacture. Evidence of ceramic production (wasters, kiln debris, and high-density scatters of pottery indicative of specialized refuse dumps) was recorded at 26 sites (Santley 1991a). These sites produced 58 components (occupations per phase) that spanned the Classic period. The general pattern was one of an increasing number of production sites with time, with the total falling off toward the end of the Classic period. The number of rural sites produc ing pottery covaried with total population throughout the Mid dle Classic, suggesting that aggregate demand for ceramics had a major impact on the incidence of manufacturing locations in the countryside. The area occupied by rural ceramic-production areas showed the same pattern. During the Early Classic pro duction sites were confined to Matacapan or to areas immedi ately around the site. With the tremendous growth in total population in the early Middle Classic, production sites were founded throughout the region, reaching a peak of 18 in late Middle Classic times. Thereafter, as population levels declined, so did the number of sites engaged in specialized pottery man ufacture. Throughout the Middle Classic most of this ceramic produc tion was concentrated at Matacapan (see Figure 11). The central part of the site is dominated by a large complex of public build ings and other mounded architecture covering approximately 2.5 km2 (Santley, Ortiz Ceballos, and Pool 1987). This urban core housed the site's principal decision makers, other elites, and their retainers. Distributed around this central core was a large</page><page sequence="10">252 Santley LARGE CENTER ^ SMALL CENTER £ LARGE VILLAGE # SMALL VILLAGE ■ HAMLET CONTOUR INTERVAL 100 METERS 0 12 3 4 KILOMETERS TUXTLAS REGION SURVEY GULF OF MEXICO Figure 5. Late Middle Classic period settlement pattern. area of suburban occupation covering at least 20 km2. Settle ment patterns in this area were dispersed, with groups of resi dential mounds separated by areas of relatively little occupation. Through time the picture is somewhat different (Ortiz Ceballos and Santley 1988). During the Early Classic Mataca pan was a small compact community centered on the Teotihua can Barrio. The Middle Classic period, in contrast, was a time of explosive growth, with the main occupation zone expanding to cover more than 700 ha. At 463 ha, the early Late Classic set tlement was smaller in size, but apparently it was more densely nucleated. Based on the presence of wasters, kiln debris, and high densities of sherd accumulation, the ceramic-production areas covered 22% of the area defined as the center and its major suburbs. Altogether there were 41 ceramic-production areas at Mata capan (Santley et al. 1989). Production areas at Matacapan occurred throughout the urban zone, but were most concen trated in the southern and southwestern parts of the site. These production areas often manufactured the complete range of ser vice and utilitarian wares used in the region, but larger ones were highly specialized, producing large amounts of Fine Gray and Coarse Orange. In general, the smaller the pottery-making area was, the greater the array of wares that was produced (R2 = .8464; p &lt; .001). Surface refuse densities at the larger produc</page><page sequence="11">Economy of ancient Matacapan 253 LARGE CENTER A SMALL CENTER £ LARGE VILLAGE # SMALL VILLAGE ■ HAMLET CONTOUR INTERVAL 100 METERS 0 12 3 4 KILOMETERS TUXTLAS REGION SURVEY Figure 6. Early Late Classic period settlement pattern. tion entities were also among the greatest recorded by the Mata capan survey. These densities were normally in the 30-45 sherds/m2 range and sometimes exceeded 200 sherds/m2. Production areas in the countryside, in contrast, typically occurred at small sites or occasionally at specific parts of larger sites. The area devoted to ceramic production in the country side varied inversely over time with the area occupied by pot tery making at Matacapan (R2 = .8604; p &lt; .05). In other words, as the pottery-manufacturing industry centered at Mata capan grew in scale, less production occurred at rural sites, sug gesting that the top-ranking center increasingly dominated pottery making at the regional level through time. Production emphasis in the countryside was either on the complete suite of wares or sometimes on Fine Gray, Fine Orange, or Coarse Brown. Moreover, the density of surface debris at rural sites was significantly lower than at Matacapan. Pottery densities in the countryside rarely exceeded 20-25 sherds/m2 and often were less, indicating production on a more infrequent basis or man ufacture over shorter periods of time. Larger sites also accounted for a greater share of pottery pro duction with time. For example, in the early Middle Classic cen ters comprised 23.1% of all production sites but only 7.6% of all sites, while hamlets accounted for 61.5% of all pottery making sites but 78.3% of all sites. These differences became more pronounced with time, reaching a maximum in the Late Classic (33.3 vs. 8.9% for centers, 44.4 vs. 83.3% for hamlets).</page><page sequence="12">254 Santley X-J LARGE CENTER A SMALL CENTER Q LARGE VILLAGE # SMALL VILLAGE ■ HAMLET CONTOUR INTERVAL 100 METERS 0 1 2 3 4 KILOMETERS TUXTLAS REGION SURVEY GULF OF MEXICO Figure 7. Lace Late Classic period settlement pattern. In the Middle Classic there were few differences in the incidence of production at villages in comparison to total sites (15.4-18.8 vs. 11.8-17.9%). In the Late Classic, however, villages accounted for 22.2% of production sites but only 7.8% of all sites. In the Middle Classic, therefore, ceramic production was concentrated at Matacapan, but with time it became increasingly decentral ized, as production became more common at smaller sites, first small centers and then villages. These developments were asso ciated with the decline of Matacapan as a major production cen ter and the abandonment of its ceramic-production entities. There were several exceptions to this pattern of rural produc tion at smaller sites (Santley 1991a; Santley et al. 1988). La Lomita (Site 11), located several kilometers northeast of Mata capan, contained a large production area covering 10 ha. The production area consisted of complexes of kilns placed on ter races constructed atop a low hill. Pottery that broke during fir ing was discarded on the sides of the hill or at its base. Ceramic densities in the firing area ranged from 3 to 8 sherds/m2, while densities in the waster dumps were higher. The low density of pottery near the kilns indicates that the firing zone was carefully maintained, with most waste carted to special middens outside the firing area. The site's proximity to the major area of pot tery making at the major center suggests that it was a part of the main ceramic-production industry based at Matacapan. La Lomita, however, was inhabited mainly during the Late Clas sic, a time period when occupation at Matacapan was on the wane. Ceramics were also intensively produced at El Salado, a salt making station situated some 10 km southwest of Matacapan. Occupation was distributed over 8.25 ha, with the highest den</page><page sequence="13">Economy of ancient Matacapan 255 SAN ANDRES TUXTLA -800 -600 -400 -200 0 200 400 600 RESEARCH FUNOED Of THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AND THE UNIVERSITY Of NEW MEXICO MINIMUM CONTOUR: 1 SHERO/COUECTION CONTOUR INTERVAL: 10 SHERDS/COUECTKJN H FOR 10-1500 SHERO CONTOURS MAP BASED ON 23.517 ARTIFACTS FROM 1549 SURFACE COLLECTIONS h i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i n -800 -600 -400 -200 0 200 400 600 Figure 8.

The saltmaking process involved boiling brine in jars and shallow basins, vessels that were produced at El Salado in large numbers for this purpose. Surface ceramic densities in the saltmaking zone often amounted to 110 sherds/m2, reaching more than 300 sherds/ m2 on occasion. Road cuts bisecting the site showed that the deposit was at least 1-2 m deep, indicating that production was large scale and intensive. The major occupation at El Salado dated to the late Late Classic period, although nominal Early Formative and early Late Classic components were present at the site as well. To recapitulate, on the one hand production sites in the countryside were generally small in size and manufactured the full array of wares used by local consumers. As there was a strong relationship between the number of production sites and total population, most ceramics manufactured at these sites were probably destined for consumers situated around them. On the other hand, although smaller-scale production entities at Mata capan did make most of the wares commonly used in domes tic contexts, a number of manufacturing sites in and around Matacapan were considerably larger in size and emphasized the production of particular wares. Ceramic production at Mata capan's larger-scale pottery-making areas was more specialized and apparently oriented to a hinterland of much larger size. Finally, as production at Matacapan decreased in scale, more ceramics were produced at other sites, implying that small cen ters and villages in the countryside increasingly expropriated the production activities formerly commonplace at Matacapan. For the Middle Classic this patterning is in keeping with the dendritic model of a regional central-place system where the primate cen ter has an export orientation. Toward the end of the sequence, on the other hand, it indicates that the production system had become more decentralized, implying an economy characterized by greater commercialization. Variation in Mode of Craft Production Mode of production refers to the organization of manufactur ing activities. Most of the evidence for differences in mode of production pertains to pottery manufacture (Arnold 1991; Combes and Lewis 1967; Peacock 1982; Savage and Lombard 1986; Stark 1985; van der Leeuw 1976; Weatherill 1971), although some information is also available for other crafts (Andrews 1983; Berdan 1982; Cook 1982, 1984, 1985; Coon 1958; English 1966; Hassig 1985). Survey of this literature indi cates that three modes of specialized production were common place in preindustrial settings. Following Peacock (1982) and van der Leeuw (1976), I term these (1) the household industry, (2) the workshop industry, and (3) the manufactory (see Sant ley et al. [1989] and Santley and Kneebone [1993] for a more extended discussion of this variation in Mesoamerica and its archaeological consequences). During the Middle Classic most pottery production was con centrated at Matacapan. Matacapan's ceramic-production industry was internally differentiated, with some manufactur ing occurring in household contexts and other production tak ing place in specialized workshops, nucleated industries, and manufactories (Arnold et al. 1993; Pool 1990; Santley 1994; Santley et al. 1989).4 Production scale and intensity increased through time, reaching a peak in the early Late Classic period. These developments were reflected by enlargements in the area devoted to production, increases in the density of materials in waster dumps near firing loci, and the growth of more highly specialized production areas. Most ceramic production in "downtown" Matacapan in volved small-scale household industries. Some of these produc tion areas specialized in the manufacture of a few wares, but most appear to have produced the full suite of wares and ves sel forms. In addition, several household industry areas were located next to temples or elite platforms, suggesting manufac ture for specific elite clienteles or central institutions. Produc 4 In a household industry domestic producers provide for their own needs but also supply some goods to other households. Specialized pro duction, however, remains very much a secondary source of income and a part-time activity relative to food production. At the level of the work shop industry specialization becomes the primary means of producer income. Production generally takes place at a special site, the workshop, which is commonly located on the producer's house lot or at a special location elsewhere in the community. Work regimes here are spatially segregated only in so far as production requires special permanent facil ities such as kilns, forges, and looms, but production generally does not require the employment of individuals from outside of the specialist's household. Specialists working in nucleated industries or manufacto ries are engaged in the mass replication of goods, frequently for con sumers who reside far beyond the production entity. Production always occurs at a special place, with different activities associated with man ufacture performed in different parts of the complex. Because these pro duction entities contain a number of special work areas, they may attain considerable size and employ as many as 20-60 persons full-time.</page><page sequence="15">Economy of ancient Matacapan 257 3000 3200 3400 3600 3800 4000 4200 4400 4600 4800 5000 5200 4200 TEOTIHUACAN BARRIO1 FINE GRAY AREAS BEZUAPAN 3 COMOAPAN 4000 4200 4400 4600 4800 5000 TRIANGLES - MOUNDS CONTOUR INTERVAL: 20 SHERDS PER COLLECTION MINIMUM CONTOUR: 20 SHERDS PER COLLECTION MAP PROOCCED BY ROBERT $ SAVTLE V AND TREVOR KLI DT Figure 11.

Isopleth map of El Salado (Late Classic period). tion in suburban Matacapan was more variable. Many of these production sites were probably also organized as household industries. Their spatial location associates with variations in the distribution of domestic occupation (R2 = .8521; p &lt; .02), indicating that production output was oriented to meet the needs of the local site population. Other production areas in Matacapan's suburbs were much larger in size. Some of these production entities were apparently organized as workshop industries (e.g., the Fine Gray area), while others probably operated as nucleated industries (e.g., Area 199) or as manufactories (e.g., the Comoapan area) (Arnold et al. 1993; Pool 1990; Santley 1994; Santley et al. 1989) (see Figure 13). The location of these production entities is not highly correlated with population density, implying that a large proportion of their output was destined for exchange beyond Matacapan (R2 = .3241; p &gt; .30). The total volume of produc tion at Matacapan's larger-scale industries must have been con siderable, amounting to literally hundreds of thousands of vessels annually. On the other hand, pottery production at rural sites was less intensive than at Matacapan. Most of these sites were hamlets or small villages, and production residues were often associated with residential mounds or were mixed with domestic refuse. The incidence of production sites covaried with that of nonpro duction sites (R2 = .7457; p &lt; .01), indicating that rural ceramic manufacture was geared primarily to consumers living in nearby settlements. Many of these sites manufactured the full array of wares and vessel forms used in domestic contexts, a production emphasis also expected if pottery making was ori ented largely to local clienteles. Pottery making at Axoquin (Site 48), Eyipantla (Site 121), and Maxpil (Site 143) is fairly typical of production in rural areas during the Middle Classic period (see Figure 14).

In most instances ceramic production was confined to a particular area of the site, but in a few others it was distributed throughout the Middle Classic occupation zone. Although evidence of produc tion generally occurred in parts of the site where surface refuse densities were high, the amount of pottery present was gener ally much less than at Matacapan's workshops, nucleated indus tries, and manufactories. Each production area often covered an area less than .5 ha in size. Their small size, plus the pres ence of domestic artifacts at the same locations, suggest that most production took place in household contexts. Most rural pottery making therefore was probably organized as a series of household industries, with the family being the basic unit of pro duction and ceramics manufacture providing only a part of the household's subsistence income. As mentioned above, ceram ics manufacture at La Lomita and El Salado was larger scale and more intensive, but production of this type appears to have been the exception rather than the rule. In sum, the household industry was apparently the most common mode of ceramic production in the Tuxtlas in Classic times. The output of most of these entities appears to have been destined for local clienteles, either at Matacapan or about the region as a whole. This finding is not unexpected, given the fact that pottery is a low-order utilitarian good that is very bulky and breakable. Production-point frequency thus should covary with the incidence of consumers, especially in a transport system that</page><page sequence="18">260 Santley AXOQUIN EYIPANTU\ MAXPIL -250 -150 - 50 50 150 250 350 inniiiiiiii i i i iit MS SUM«Ct COLLECTIONS ANO TMC UMVtBSITY Of hi* l*«CO -500 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I -250 -150 -50 I I i I I l I l I I I I I I I I I I 50 150 250 350 200 100 -200 -300 -400 -200-150-100-50 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 -600 ANO TMC UWOdUVTY Of KCW M£»CO I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I lit 200-150-100-50 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Figure 14. Isopleth maps of small-scale ceramic-production areas at rural sites in the Tuxtlas (early Middle Classic period). involved the human bearer as the primary power source. The concentration of larger-scale production loci at Matacapan, however, is very unusual in several respects. First, production-mode order does not covary well with com munity rank in Middle Classic times, as would be expected under an interlocking marketing arrangement. Rather, most of the production entities above the level of a household industry were located at one place, Matacapan, with other sites support ing the smallest-scale industries. Even at large second-order cen ters like Ranchoapan and Teotepec, communities that rivaled Matacapan in size and internal complexity, pottery production was very small scale and apparently organized on the household industry level. In contrast, patterning of this kind should be the case if Matacapan headed a dendritic or solar central-place sys tem. Here second-order centers should function primarily as bulking and break-of-bulk points for the transferal of goods and raw materials to and from the primate center rather than as major production locations. Second, most household industries at Matacapan and in rural areas made the complete array of wares, suggesting that much of their output was for local clienteles. However, produc tion at Area 199 and the Comoapan complex, Matacapan's largest-scale industries, was devoted primarily to the manufac ture of Coarse Orange, a ware that was rarely very common in domestic contexts throughout the region. Again the implication is that these production entities manufactured pottery for dis tribution throughout the region and probably to areas beyond. Other areas at Matacapan specialized in the production of Fine</page><page sequence="19">Economy of ancient Matacapan 261 Gray. Although this ware and its variants are common in ceramic assemblages from Middle Classic sites, these ceramics were also produced at large numbers of sites, suggesting that some of this production was destined for consumers through out the region and probably for areas farther afield. Finally, there is evidence that ceramics produced at Mataca pan and nearby sites were exchanged beyond the area surveyed and to other parts of Mesoamerica as well. In other parts of the Tuxtlas ceramics typologically identical to those produced at Matacapan have been reported at El Picayo, Matalapan, and Piedra Labrada (Ortiz Ceballos 1975, personal communication 1988). Elsewhere in Mesoamerica similar pottery occurs at Tres Zapotes (Drucker 1943), Laguna de los Cerros (Ponciano Ortíz Ceballos, personal communication 1983), San Lorenzo (Coe and Diehl 1980), in La Mixtequilla (Barbara L. Stark, personal communication 1989), and in the Valley of Oaxaca (Sabloff et al. 1982). Tuxtlas ceramics are never very common in these areas, but it should be borne in mind that the primary ware reported in the literature, Tuxtlas Polychrome, is also not very common in the Tuxtlas. Assemblages from these sites date primarily to the late Middle Classic and early Late Classic in the Tuxtlas chronology. It seems likely that other Tuxtlas wares were prob ably also exported about Mesoamerica in Classic times, but comprehensive chemical analyses of ceramic assemblages from sites in these areas are still not forthcoming. Large quantities of Matacapan ceramics are also present at Teotihuacan (Rattray 1987). For example, approximately 5% of the pottery from the Merchant's Barrio at Teotihuacan apparently came from the Tuxtlas. Represented in the assemblage are Coarse Orange and Coarse Brown, as well as Fine Gray, Fine Orange, Fine Buff, and their variants. Current evidence thus indicates that Matacapan's ceramic production industry had a distribution orbit throughout a large area. These ceramics occur throughout the Tuxtlas and are a consistent component of several assemblages from other parts of Mesoamerica during the Middle and early Late Classic peri ods. Production for export in large-scale industries is an attri bute of system structure that is consistent with the dendritic central-place model. It is not what one would expect, however, if Matacapan dominated a bounded hierarchical or solar central-place system. MODEL EVALUATION The data presented above summarize characteristics of regional settlement patterns, rank-size ordering, ceramic-manufacturing locations, and variations in mode of pottery production during the Classic period in the Tuxtlas Mountains. This evidence per tains to variability in system structure associated with the four models of economic organization discussed above as well as to its material manifestation in the archaeological record. With the evidence at hand I suggest that Matacapan headed a bounded hierarchical economy during the late Early Classic. This was the period of initial Teotihuacan contact at Mataca pan as well as at a few other sites in the region. Almost all of the early Middle Classic occupation was concentrated at Mata capan, and settlement at rural sites was very scanty. Although the late Early Classic rank-size distribution was extremely pri mate like, Matacapan was not an especially large site at this time, and specialized ceramic production at the site was quite limited. Thus, it does not appear that ceramics produced at the site were exchanged beyond the Tuxtlas. Rather, most produc tion probably was destined for local consumers who resided at Matacapan and in its immediate sustaining area. A dendritic political economy apparently emerged in the early Middle Classic and continued in operation until the end of the period. Such a development is not wholly unexpected given the fact that bounded hierarchical and dendritic econo mies have the same basic structure emphasizing vertical artic ulations, the major difference being the export orientation of the top-ranking center in the latter. Several lines of evidence support this claim. Information on regional settlement patterns indicates that the Middle Classic settlement system grew from the top down. Set tlement in the area involved the establishment of a center at Matacapan, followed by the colonization of rural areas. After their founding, lesser-ranking centers displayed little tendency for interstitial placement; rather, the pattern was one of decreas ing size with increasing distance from Matacapan. In addition, sites that may have had special functions were located along major routes of transit out of the Tuxtlas: along the Rio Catemaco, in particular near Salto Eyipantla, or on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, implying the use of the canoe or raft to move goods out of the area. Rank-size distributions throughout the Middle Classic period were very primate like, with a substantial proportion of the pop ulation of the region residing at one site, Matacapan. The fre quency of small-scale production sites covaried with the total population living nearby, suggesting that most of their output was destined for local clienteles. Many of these pottery-produc tion entities were probably organized as household industries; in other words, most specialization occurred in domestic con texts and probably was a part-time endeavor. In contrast, ceramic production at the primate center was much more complex and internally differentiated than at other sites. Matacapan contained most of the region's larger-scale pro duction entities that emphasized the manufacture of particular types of pottery. Some of these production entities were orga nized as manufactories, others as nucleated industries or as workshops. Pottery making at these locales probably had an export orientation. Some production was undoubtedly for dis tribution throughout the Tuxtlas, but pottery from Matacapan also occurred at sites in areas as far away as the Basin of Mex ico or the Valley of Oaxaca, sometimes in significant amounts. A more regionally integrated political economy may have developed in the region in the late Late Classic. This system was similar to the interlocking central-place model in several respects. The presence of a more regionally integrated system is indicated by a more developed central-place hierarchy, with more of the population living in centers of smaller size, a rank-size distri bution that approaches log normality, and the occurrence of more ceramic-production entities at smaller centers. Also sug gestive of a more commercially oriented system are the lack of evidence that any one center dominated pottery manufacture to the extent that Matacapan had done previously, and the absence of information from Mesoamerica at large of the long-distance export of Tuxtlas ceramics after the early Late Classic. SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS The preceding discussion indicates that the economy that Mata capan dominated changed through time. In the late Early Clas</page><page sequence="20">262 Santley sic a small center was established at Matacapan. Most of the population in the region resided at Matacapan at this time, and there was only limited evidence of ceramic production at two parts of the site, indicating that most pottery making was prob ably for local consumption. The early Middle Classic, in con trast, was a period of rapid and sustained population growth, both at Matacapan and in the countryside. Not surprisingly, there was a great increase in pottery making, with many of Matacapan's larger-scale production entities emerging at this time. The late Middle Classic saw a further increase in ceramic production in the region, and by early Late Classic times pro duction scale at Matacapan increased even further, but with a drop in total population and the frequency of production points. Population loss continued into the late Late Classic period, with Matacapan largely abandoned by the end of the period. The political economy of the region in the late Late Classic may have been more regionally integrated than before, but its contacts with other parts of Mesoamerica had been largely severed. The establishment of a bounded hierarchical system centered at Matacapan in the late Early Classic was probably associated with the sites's function as a low-level nodal center that allocated a variety of goods and services to a small rural population dis tributed around it. Some of the goods provided were ceramics, but there were probably other commodities as well. The small scale of Matacapan's ceramic-production industry was proba bly linked to the site's limited population and the small size of its rural sustaining area. Economies of this type were probably very common in ancient Mesoamerica, especially in regions that were politically balkanized or where the population of any one polity was insufficient to control access to raw materials and extraregional distribution routes. The emergence of a dendritic political economy in Middle Classic times was probably related to a number of situational variables acting in concert. First, Matacapan became the region's major central place. The growth of population at Mata capan seems to be related to its location in the region's prime agricultural zone, which provided the agrarian support base for the establishment of central industries at the site. Rural areas also experienced substantial population growth in the Middle Classic. The large number of newly founded sites in Mataca pan's hinterland in turn would have needed basic craft goods; consequently, small-scale ceramic-production industries ap peared at a large number of settlements in the countryside. Much of this population growth undoubtedly represents immi gration from areas outside of the survey region. Most of this immigration probably originated from areas directly around the Tuxtlas, but some of it may have come from Teotihuacan. Another variable affecting the emergence of a dendritic politi cal economy centered at Matacapan was the localized occur rence of sediments rich in the clay mineral, kaolinite. These clays derive primarily from the Concepción Formation and were used to manufacture all of the fine-paste ceramics and Coarse Orange pottery made at Matacapan and at most rural sites dur ing this period. Although the Concepción Formation appears throughout the southwestern Tuxtlas, it is only near Matacapan and in the Rio Catemaco valley that the clays occur in direct association with large tracts of prime agricultural land. As indi cated above, the political economy that Matacapan dominated involved a differentiated ceramic-production industry at urban center whose principal components had an export orientation as well as a large number of smaller-scale production entities at rural sites that produced goods for local clienteles. Chemical analyses of modern clays and archaeological ceramics indicate that potters relied primarily on nearby clays (Pool and Santley 1992); however, it is possible that raw clay and pottery were also shipped from the countryside to Matacapan for subsequent exchange outside of the region. In all likelihood, other goods were produced in the countryside for long-distance exchange as well, particularly liquid amber, basalt for monumental sculp ture and basic domestic technology, and special tropical woods, but at present there are few archaeological indications of their production and distribution. A third factor that may have had a major impact on the development of the dendritic political economy was Mataca pan's location near major lines of water transit. Centers situated in such locations often drain goods from fan-shaped local hin terlands for distribution to markets outside of the region. Local systems are often connected to the nodal center by primitive transport modes (i.e, burden bearers), but goods may be shipped much longer distances outside of the region because water trans port is some 20-50 times more efficient than hauling goods over land. Moreover, Matacapan is situated midway between the mouths of the Rio Papaloapan and Rio Coatzacoalcos, which would have facilitated access to markets in the interior of the Gulf Coast plain. As noted above, two sites, La Barra and Montepío, may have functioned as ports of exit from the Tux tlas for Matacapan, and their history of occupation coincides with the growth and demise of Matacapan's major ceramic production industries. A final factor of some importance in Middle Classic times was the Teotihuacan presence in the Tuxtlas. Teotihuacan con tacts with the Tuxtlas were most concentrated at Matacapan, but they were also present at rural sites around the center. As I have pointed out elsewhere, this presence implies a enclave of foreigners from central Mexico that settled at Matacapan in the late Early Classic (Santley 1983, 1989; Santley, Yarborough, and Hall 1987).5 This enclave may have later fostered further immi gration to Matacapan and may have been responsible for set ting up and overseeing the region's ceramic-production industry in Middle Classic times. Another important enclave function may have been the physical transport of goods into and out of the Tuxtlas, with it also serving as a base for caravans from Te otihuacan hauling goods to the south Gulf Coast. The growth of Matacapan's pottery-making industry consequently may have been closely tied to Teotihuacan's capability to move substan tial quantities of goods over a large area. Interestingly, Teoti huacan-style materials are most common at Matacapan in late 5The Teotihuacan-style assemblage at Matacapan includes portable artifacts as well as architecture. These materials reflect ritual-ceremonial activities on both the household and site level as well as household food preparation and consumption. Included here are artifacts such as cylin drical vases with tripods closely resembling Teotihuacan originals, floreros, cups with annular bases, braceros, anthropomorphic figurines, candeleros, and incensarios. This assemblage consistently occurs throughout the site, both in the main civic-ceremonial district and in outlying suburbs, and is often present in significant numbers. Architec tural indicators include talud-tablero platform construction and resi dential platforms that supported buildings housing multiple families. Santley (1989) and Santley, Yarborough, and Hall (1987) have discussed the implications of these materials with regard to enclave identification. A discussion of changes in Teotihuacan-style assemblage variability through time at Matacapan is presented in Arnold et al. (1993) and Pool (1992).</page><page sequence="21">Economy of ancient Matacapan 263 Early and early Middle Classic times (Pool 1992); however, sub stantial quantities of pottery were still produced at Matacapan in early Late Classic times (Ortiz Ceballos and Santley 1988), indicating that the progressive withdrawal of Teotihuacan con tacts with the region had few immediate effects on the decline of the ceramic-production industry at Matacapan. The development of a more regionally integrated production system in the late Late Classic was associated with the decline of Matacapan as the area's major center, the collapse of the ceramic-production system centered at Matacapan, and a loss of population throughout the region. Although the late Late Classic production system was similar to the late Early Classic system in several respects, there were a number of important dif ferences between the two. First, production in late Late Clas sic times took place at a greater number of small centers that were more equal in size. Second, there were fewer production sites, but most appear to have been organized as household industries. Ceramic production at La Lomita and at Sites 94 and 114, in contrast, appears to have been somewhat more intensive and larger scale than before; however, these settlements were located at opposite ends of the Rio Catemaco valley, suggest ing that a few smaller sites had expropriated some of the pro duction activities that Matacapan had dominated earlier but that each made pottery for discrete subregional clienteles. Finally, there is little evidence that pottery produced in the Tuxtlas was exchanged beyond the Tuxtlas region in late Late Classic times. The bulk of the evidence therefore suggests a reorganization in ceramic production in the Tuxtlas during the Late Classic. This reorganization seems to have involved a repositioning of pro duction points, a reduction in their economy of scale, as well as production for more spatially restricted clienteles. In this paper I have considered various aspects of the archae ological record from the Tuxtlas Mountains during the Classic period with the aim of defining the economic system that was dominated by Matacapan. My reading of the evidence presented indicates that a dendritic political economy dominated ex changes during the Middle Classic period. There also appear to have been marked changes in system structure from Early to Middle and from Middle to Late Classic times. These shifts in regional economy appear to be linked to the role of the Teoti huacan presence in the area as well as to a number of other fac tors, the importance of which changed with time. Many of the aspects of variation in economy discussed above still remain to be concretely tested with archaeological data from the Tuxtlas. For example, it is possible that the Tuxtlas surveys have yet to reach the boundaries of the local economic system controlled by Matacapan. Likewise, more data from excavations are needed to provide samples from firm chronological contexts throughout the region. These problems I leave as questions for future research. RESUMEN En 1979 inicié un programa de trabajo de campo arqueológico en las Montañas Tuxtlas en el sur de Veracruz, México. Una de las hipótesis de esta investigación sostuvo que Matacapan, el principal sitio arqueológico del área, encabezó una economía política dominada por individuos del gran centro de Teotihuacán, en el altiplano central. En este artículo presento evidencia que caracteriza la economía de Matacapan durante el período clásico. Concluyo que el sistema de organización varió sig nificativamente a través del tiempo. Los hallazgos en las Montañas Tux tlas indican que el sistema regional clásico temprano fue de pequeña escala y probablemente estuvo organizado en una jerarquía económica delimitada. En contraste, durante el período clásico medio se desarrolló una economía política dendrítica en la que se enfatizó la producción de cerámica y/o de sus contenidos para su distribución más alia de la regón inmediata. El sistema clásico tardío fue de menor escala, y la mayor parte de la producción se destinó a clientes locales, pero aparentamente ésta fue más comercializada y en muchos aspectos se asemejó de lugar central entrelazado. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The research reported here was generously funded by grants from the National Science Foundation as well as awards from the Heinz Trust of the Pittsburgh Foundation, the University of New Mexico, and var ious other sources. The fieldwork that I conducted would not been pos sible without the permission of the Consejo de Arqueología of the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia in Mexico and the con sent of various local landholders in the Tuxtlas. Christopher Pool made a number of comments on earlier drafts of this paper. While he is not entirely in agreement with the conclusions presented here, his points are greatly appreciated. Major comments were also made by three "anon ymous" reviewers, which greatly improved the quality of the final result. Any abuse of their suggestions, however, is entirely my responsibility.
