<plain_text><page sequence="1">M. Alinei et al. (eds.), Atlas Linguarum Europae. Cartes/Maps, vol. I, Commentaires/Commentaries, vol. I, Van Gorcum, Assen, 1983. Reviewed by Hans-Peter Stoffel. Each fascicle of the^fto Linguarum Europae (ALE) is planned to consist of three separate items: a set of maps in large format, a book of commentaries 'on these jnaps, and a volume containing the lexical 'raw-mateiaals'. The first isskfc of ALE, which is being reviewed here, contains a set of 19 maps (Cartes/Maps I.I.) and the separate volume of commentaries (Commentaires/Commentaries, I.I, xcvii+ 177pp.). The raw materials will be published at a later stage. The ALE is the first linguistic atlas to encompass all European countries. It defines Europe's borders in geographical terms and contains material from about 2500 net points ranging from Ireland to the Ural mountains and to the northern slopes of the Caucasus. It includes six language families ("superfamilies") embracing 21 language groups, including Romany (Indie). The onomasiological and semasiological information provided by the maps, and the commentaries of the ALE, come from almost a thousand languages or dialects. The ALE is being published under the auspices of UNESCO under an all-European editorship headed by M. Alinei, and with the co-operation of 39 national committees. Obviously, the wealth of material in the ALE makes it impossible for one person to review a work of such dimension in detail, and I shall therefore concentrate on some of its major features. 127</page><page sequence="2">Though the title of the ALE is in 'neutral' Latin, the master language for reference and for abbreviations is French. The two introductory articles, and the 14 commentaries on the maps, are written in French (7), English (5), and German (4). The ALE presents two basic novelties: it is a supranational atlas of the "fourth generation", encompassing various language groups (the previous three generations of linguistic atlases being 1) national only, 2) regional, and 3) supranational, but for one language group only). The second basic innovation is a methodological one: the ALE contains two referents, rainbow and grasshopper, for which it gives not just onomasiological maps but also several motivational maps which provide information on comparative semasiology. The ALE owes the idea for motivational maps to the Soviet ALE com- mittee under the late R.I. Avanesov, and to the president of the editorial committee of the ALE, M. Alinei. The motivational map 1.9 (together with Alinei's comments in the Commentaries, pp. 47-80), for instance, contains information on zoomorphism, pagan anthropomorphism, and Christian and Islamic anthropomorphism for the presentation and interpretation of rainbow. The set of maps (scale 1:10 million) contains 19 maps for 14 questions (referents) of which 14 are onomasiological and 5 moti- vational. The questions are from the basic lexicon of languages ranging from sun (I.I) to grasshopper (1. 18/1.19). The publication of the maps in a separate volume proves to be very advantageous for the user: they can be folded out and are of a sufficiently large for- mat (40x50 cms), as are the basic captions on the left-hand side of the maps. Thus, the net points (numbers) and their linguistic features (signs and other symbols) can easily be located on the maps, though a magnifying glass may still be necessary to decipher some of the points in more densely surveyed areas such as 102S and 8G. How- ever, the editors must have foreseen this problem and have provided a black-and-white only groundmap (1.0) which can be removed from a pocket at the end of the atlas and be consulted together with the (bound) linguistic maps if necessary. Naturally, some areas have been more densely surveyed than others, depending on the amount of linguistic (field-) work carried out so far in the various regions, and on the density of dialects. The selection of points to represent a given language and its dialects is excellent, as shown, for instance, in the selection of points for the linguistic samples representing the small Swiss Rhaeto-Romance language: points 401, 402, and 403 clearly represent the three major subdivisions of this Romance language. The wealth of material in the Atlas becomes evident when one consults the accompanying book of Commentaries with the maps. 128</page><page sequence="3">The first third of this volume contains general information, lists of abbreviations and complete lists of the approximately 2500 net points in the various countries, and tables of phonetic transcription and transliteration. The table for the transliteration of the modern Russian alphabet (p. lxxxvii) also contains variants for Bulgarian, but it might have been more useful to give a table for the transliteration of all Cyrillic alphabets because words from other Slavonic languages also appear in the texts and captions. The transliteration system is not always adhered to, and interference from a French-type trans- literation can easily be discovered in the table of net points for Russian in the USSR (p. lxxiv; 28.0). Errors with diacritic symbols can be found too (e.g. in the points mentioned for Yugoslavia: Cajetina, -Durakovac, p. lxxx) but such errors seem almost inevitable in a work of such proportions. The first part of the Commentaries also contains an introduction to the project of the ALE by the main editor M. Alinei, in English (pp. xv-xxxix), and information on automatic mapping by W. Putschke and R. Neuman, in German (pp. lxxxix-xcvii). The infor- mation in this part of the Commentaries is absolutely essential if the user wants to gain maximum information from the maps and the additional comments. The main body of the Commentaries (177 pp.) consists of de- tailed interpretations of the maps. In each case the comments have been written by one or several eminent European linguists or dia- lectologists. While there is no absolute uniformity in the presentation of these comments they all focus on etymological, etymographical, onomasio- logical and semasiological features and consist of an article followed by table-like lists. Maps and comments contain numerous abbreviat- ions, symbols and signs, but familiarisation with them - which takes some time - shows that the editors have achieved a commendable degree of uniformity in this area. For the Slavists among the users of the ALE the maps and commentaries are of special value. While much material for the ALE comes from original research all over Europe it does also rely on published primary sources and on ar- chives. One of the few supranational atlases (though it is still in progress), from which the ALE could draw directly, was the ObXcfe- slavjanskiu lingvisticeskij atlas (OLA). Thus Slavonic language areas are well covered in the ALE, and various scholars from Slavonic countries have contributed to it: D. Brozovic (moon), N.Z. Donadze (lake), B.A. Serebrennikov (river), and R.I. Avanesov, V.V. Ivanov, N.Z. Donadze (grasshopper). The comparison of Slavonic lexical material with that of other 129</page><page sequence="4">European languages provides a rewarding study of cultural typology, geolinguistics and comparative linguistics. The ALE is a fine piece of scholarship. It can be used profitably and reliably not only by researchers but also in the classroom. Everyone interested in the study of language in its wider context will look forward to the publication of the further fascicles of the ALE.</page></plain_text>
