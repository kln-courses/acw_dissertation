<plain_text><page sequence="1">HIS DAZZLING ABSENCE: The Shekinah in Jonathan Edwards LINDA MUNK University of Toronto If we find Jonathan Edwards hard to read, it may be because we have forgotten what he's talking about. I do not mean the Bible and Puritan theology, but the wider context of what was then within the horizon of Christian thinking. What, for example, do we make of Edwards's reference to "the Shechinah" in this passage from A History of the Work of Re demption (1739; pub. 1774)? Again, by this [the Babylonian] captivity, the glory and magnifi cence of the temple were taken away, and the temple that was built afterwards was nothing in comparison with it. Thus it was meet, that when the time drew nigh that the glorious antetype of the temple should appear, that the typical temple should have its glory withdrawn. Moreover they [the Jews] lost by the captivity the two tables of the testimony delivered to Moses, on which God with his own fingers wrote the ten commandments on Mount Sinai.. . . Another thing that the ancient Jews say was wanting in the second temple, was the Shechinah, or cloud of glory over the mercy seat. This was promised to be in the tabernacle: Lev. xvi.2. "For I will ap pear in the cloud upon the mercy seat." And we read elsewhere of the cloud of glory descending into the tabernacle, Exod. xl.35. and so do we likewise with respect to Solomon's temple. But we have no account that this cloud of glory was in the second temple. And the ancient accounts of the Jews say, that there was no such thing in the second temple. This was needless in the second temple, consid ering that God had promised he would fill this temple with glory another way, viz. by Christ's coming into it; which was afterwards fulfilled. See Haggai ii.7. "I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of Hosts." (563; 252-54; italics added)' 1</page><page sequence="2">2 Early American Literature, Volume 27, igg2 Nothing in the Bible will help us with the reference to the Shekinah. For Edwards's source, however mediated, is the Rabbinic tradition ("the ancient accounts of the Jews") that five things were absent from the second Temple. These include the Ark, the Mercy Seat, and the Cherubim; the fire from heaven upon the altar; and the visible Presence, or Shekinah.2 Edwards identifies the Shekinah with the cloud of glory that filled the Tabernacle and Solomon's Temple, interpreting it as a figure or type of Christ.3 The root of the post-biblical noun Shekinah is the Hebrew verb shakan?to tabernacle or to dwell. To follow the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), Shekinah means: "The visible manifestation of the Divine Majesty, esp. when resting between the cherubim over the mercy-seat or in the temple of Solomon; a glory or refulgent light symbolising the Divine Presence." "In the Targums the word is used as a periphrasis to designate God when He is said to dwell among the cherubim, etc., so as to avoid any approach to anthropomorphic expression." The first noted example of English usage is J. Stillingfleet's Shecinah: or a Demonstration of the Divine Presence in the Places of Religious Worship, published in 1663. Another ex ample is taken from J. Scott's Christian Life (1681-86): "That fiery Schechinah, or visible Glory of the Lord, in which he descended on Mount Sinai." A further citation is a title of 1682: The Moral Schechinah: or a Discourse on God's Glory. Isaac Watts takes up Shekinah in 1741: "The Schecina, or bright glory, which is a symbol of God's presence." Likewise George Eliot in Scenes of Clerical Life (1856): "The golden sunlight beamed through the dripping boughs like a Shechinah, or visible divine presence." In Melville's Mardi (1849), the Shekinah is evoked in Babbalanja's vision: "'I, tranced, beheld an awful glory. Sphere in sphere it burned:?the one Shekinah!'"4 For Disraeli, writing in 1834: "Truth indeed is veiled, / But with a Schekinah of dazzling light." Jonathan Edwards's understanding of Shekinah includes a Christian gloss. From the late seventeenth century (we are told in the OED), the term Shekinah is applied specifically to Jesus Christ. A sermon of 1684 (on 1 Cor. 1:30) is cited: "The Schechinah, the habitation of the Majesty, is Jesus Christ; there he dwells as between the cherubim over the mercy seat." Perhaps the best-known instance of the Shekinah-Christ typology, and of the christological reading of the Shekinah idea, is found in Charles Wesley's "Hymn on the Titles of Christ" (1739): "Our Eyes on Earth survey / The Dazzling Shechinahl / Bright, in endless Glory bright, / Now in Flesh He stoops to dwell" (146-48).5 What precedes these OED citations, and no doubt occasions them, is the</page><page sequence="3">The Shekinah in Jonathan Edwards 3 publication in 1657 of Brian Walton's Polyglot Bible {Biblia Sacra Polyglotta), wherein the Aramaic or Chaldean Targum is printed in parallel with a Latin translation. The word Shekinah first appears in the Targum Onqelos, written down between the first and the fourth century A.D. As explicated by John Bowker, the word targum "means in general 'transla tion' or 'interpretation,' but in particular it is most often used to refer to the Aramaic version of the Hebrew Bible" (3).6 The Targums are interpretive translations of the Hebrew text of the Bible. Their interest and fascination lies in the crucial fact that they are not simple or literal translations of the text: they work into their translation an interpretation of what the text means. The reason for this is simple: in origin the Targums were closely con nected with the synagogue. From its earliest days (before the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70) the synagogue existed primarily for the read ing and exposition of scripture, but since many of those present had little or no knowledge of Hebrew, the public reading or recit ing of the Hebrew text had to be accompanied by a translation, or targum, of it into the vernacular. The written Aramaic Targums are derived from those accompanying translations (targums) which were intended to explain the Hebrew text. It is because the pur pose of the targum was to convey the meaning of the text to the assembled congregation that the targums could be so free in their interpretation. They provided a kind of "running commentary" on the text. There was no fear that the sacred text was being altered, or mishandled, because the text had already been read out. The purpose of the targum was to expound its meaning, (x). Wherever the word Shekinah is found in the Targums, it is in the sense of God's dwelling-place, the abiding or tabernacling of God in a certain spot. The Old Testament speaks of God's dwelling with men. The Targumists, however, use the terms "Shekinah" and "God's Shekinah" to avoid speaking directly of the Divine Presence. Thus when the Hebrew text states explicitly that God dwells somewhere (on Mount Sinai, in the Tabernacle, in the burning bush, and so on), the Targum substitutes, "cause my Shekinah (or the glory of the Shekinah) to dwell" or "to rest." For example, on Exodus 25:8 ("And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell [shakan] among them"), Targum Onqelos reads: "And they shall make a sanctuary before me, and I will cause my Shekinah to dwell among them."7 Targum Pseudo-Jonathan includes here the divine name: "And let them make for my name the sanctuary, so that I may cause my</page><page sequence="4">4 Early American Literature, Volume 27, ig?2 Shekinah to dwell in their midst." Targum Neofiti goes further: "And they shall build for my name the house of the sanctuary, and I shall cause the glory of my Shekinah to dwell in their midst." When at Bethel Jacob awakens out of his sleep to declare, "Surely the lord is in this place" (Gen 28:16), the Targum gives: "The glory of the Shekinah of yhwh is in this place." Similarly, the Targum on Haggai 1:8 ("build the house ... that I may appear in my glory" [RSV]) reads: "build the house ... that I may cause my Shekinah to dwell in it." "From meaning- the abode of God, the Shekinah gradually came to mean God Himself.... Shekinah became coined as a new word signifying the Godhead quite apart from any notion of place": J. Abelson's The Im manence of God in Rabbinical Literature is cited (79). In the Targums, one does not see God face to face. One may, however, see the glory of his Shekinah?the brilliance or radiance of the Divine Presence. Thus on Isaiah 6:5 ("my eyes have seen the King, the lord of hosts"), the Targum reads: "My eyes have seen the glory of the Shekinah of the King of this world." In brief, the Targumists interpret the divine glory as "the effulgence of the substantial glory, i.e., of the Shekinah. The Shekinah is used in the Targums as the equivalent for the Divine Being, not for His glory" (Hastings's Dictionary of the Bible). It should be noted that Shekinah does not signify a mediator between God and man, nor a separate being or entity, nor an angel, but God himself, "viewed in spatio-temporal terms as a presence" (Encyclopedia Judaica). That for the Targumists the Shekinah was not an intermediary is shown most explicitly in their commentary on Exodus 33:16 ("And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables"), where the term Shekinah is used for the Deity. Or to adopt Robert Hayward's explication of Memra, a particular way of describing God's active presence in creation and history that in many ways approximates Shekinah, it is "not a hypostasis, a being in any way separate from God, or an intermediary between the God of Israel and the creation" (5). Indeed, it would be "difficult" to find in the Targums any passage "in which activity or personality is assigned to the Shekinah."8 * * * The Shekinah-Christ typology suggested by Edwards in A History of the Work of Redemption depends partly on a remarkable sort of typology based on consonance?that is to say, on the coincidence of sound between the</page><page sequence="5">The Shekinah in Jonathan Edwards 5 Greek noun skene (tent) and the Hebrew verb shakan, meaning "to taber nacle" or "to dwell." "And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell [shakan] among them" (Exod. 25:8). Likewise, Exodus 29:45: "And I will dwell [shakan] among the children of Israel, and will be their God." (Here Onqelos targumises: "and I will cause my Shekinah to dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel.") Compare 1 Kings 6:13: "And I will dwell [shakan] among the children of Israel." Similarly Isaiah 57:15: For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; "I dwell [shakan] in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit.... In its sense of a sacred dwelling place or tabernacle, the noun mishkan, cognate with shakan, appears throughout the Hebrew Bible. Psalm 84:1 is typical: "How amiable are thy tabernacles [mishkan], O Lord of hosts!" (AV), a verse given thus in the RSV: "How lovely is thy dwelling place [mishkan] O Lord of hosts!" As well, God's glory is said to dwell in a mishkan: "O Lord I love the habitation of thy house, and the place [mishkan] where thy glory [kavod] dwells" (Ps. 26:8; RSV). From the Hebrew words mishkan and shakan, we turn to the Greek noun skene, a word that originally signified a tent. Nevertheless, in the Septuagint (the Greek version of the Hebrew Bible, made by Jews for Jews), skene and its word group are normally used to translate the Hebrew mishkan. As given in the Septuagint (LXX), Psalm 26:8, cited above, reads: "and the place [topon] where thy glory [doxes] dwells [skenomatos]." In addition, the "dwelling place" (or "tabernacles") of Psalm 84:1 is rendered skenomata, just as the "dwelling places of Jacob" (Ps. 87:2, RSV) become ta skenomata Iakob. The verb form of skene (skenoo) appears in such forms as these in the LXX: "who shall dwell [kataskenosei] in thy holy hill?" (Ps. 15:1). In Proverbs Wisdom (Sophia) is said to "dwell" (kateskenosa) with Prudence (8:12). The practice of translating mishkan or "tabernacle" by the Greek skene moves from the LXX, through Jewish inter-testamental writings (the so called Apocrypha), into the New Testament. "And he opened his mouth ... to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle [skenen], and them that dwell [skenountas] in heaven" (Rev. 13:6); "I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle [skenes] of the testimony in heaven was opened" (Rev. 15:5); "Behold the tabernacle [skene] of God is with men, and he will dwell [skenoset] with them" (21:3; cf. Lev. 26:11: "And I will set my tabernacle [LXX skene] among you"). In this context, the proem to St. John's Gospel</page><page sequence="6">6 Early American Literature, Volume 27, igg2 is most apposite: "And the Word [logos] was made flesh, and dwelt [eskenosen] among us" (1:14). In short, a remarkable transition of meaning has taken place, whereby, in the LXX and the New Testament, the Greek noun skene and its word group have taken over the connotations of the Hebrew mishkan and shakan, with their radical sense of "to tabernacle" or "to dwell." To follow Kittel's Theological Dictionary of the New Testament (TDNT): "If the rendering of mishkan by skene impressed itself on the translators [of the LXX] as the natural one, this was not because skene had of itself the sense of'dwelling'.... Rather it seemed ... that skene was the predestined word for mishkan because the two terms contain the same three consonants skn in the same sequence." At the same time, the Hebrew verb shakan resonates with the history of God's abiding Presence as recorded in the Hebrew Scriptures and in post-biblical Jewish writings; and "the idea of God's abiding presence was especially connected with the concept of the shekinah in later Judaism." It is probable that the tents or booths or tabernacles in the transfigu ration story may themselves be "an expression of God's gracious and abiding presence" (TDNT): "Master [rabbi] ... let us make three taber nacles [skenas]; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias" (Mark 9:5; cf. Matt. 17:4, Luke 9:33). In Abelson's view, the use of skene and its cognates in the New Testament refers to the Rabbinic Shekinah "in some cases but not in all. .. . But the allusion in John 1:14, where the Logos is said to 'have dwelt among us' . . . seems a probable reference to Shekinah ideas; and this is borne out when one looks at the usage in that chapter of words like 'light' [and] 'glory,' . . . reminding one of the usage in Rabbinic literature of Shekinah, Or [light], Kavod. . . . (Immanence 81). According to Hastings's Dictionary of the Bible: There can be no reasonable doubt that the Greek word skene (="tabernacle") was from its resemblance in sound and meaning used by bilingual Jews for the Heb. Shekinah. * * * In Edwards's Work of Redemption, as we have seen above, the biblical "cloud of glory" is conflated with the Shekinah. As proof-text Edwards directs us to Exodus 40:35:</page><page sequence="7">The Shekinah in Jonathan Edwards 7 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the lord [kavod yhwh] filled the tabernacle [mishkan]. And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, be cause the cloud abode [shakan] thereon, and the glory of the lord filled [male] the tabernacle. The "glory of the lord" is not the Shekinah, nor is it God himself; "for it was a matter of fixed Jewish belief that God is invisible ... the brilliance is an effluence from Deity" (Hastings's Dictionary of the Bible). We are in the realm of metonymy and of the spatial imagination: if the word Shekinah is a concept standing for God's immanence, as somehow imagined apart from his transcendence, the glory of the Shekinah is God's Presence conceived as light. What seems especially important in a reading of Edwards is that the Old Testament concept of divine glory or kavod, and the post-biblical concept of the Shekinah as divine effulgence, or as "universally diffused Divine Presence,"9 are inseparable. This inseparability has, however, been obscured in Greek translation. The connotations of Shekinah and of the Hebrew kavod are both rendered by the Greek doxa: "Since the Shekinah is light, those passages of the Apocrypha and New Testament which mention radiance, and in which the Greek text reads doxa, refer to the Shekinah, there being no other Greek equivalent for the word" (The Jewish Encyclopedia [1905]).10 The secular or non-biblical meaning of doxa is "what one thinks," or "opinion." But according to the Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, there is "not a single example in either the NT or the post-apostolic fathers" of doxa used in the sense of "opinion." Instead, doxa has taken on the meaning of "radiance," "glory," which meaning "is not found in secular Greek." In the NT ... the word is used for the most part in a sense for which there is no Greek analogy whatever and of which there is only an isolated example in Philo. That is to say it denotes "divine and heavenly radiance," the "loftiness and majesty of God," and even the "being of God" and His world. How does the word come to have this new significance? To answer this question it is neces sary that we study the Hebrew kavod. Tracing the use of kavod in the Old Testament, and of doxa in the Septuagint and the New Testament, the entry on doxa and its cognates (by von Rad and Kittel) alludes to the Shekinah idea of rabbinic Judaism. "That the shekinah and the kabod are closely related may be seen from equivalents used in [Targum Jonathan]. When the shekinah comes to Sion,</page><page sequence="8">8 Early American Literature, Volume 27, igg2 the kabod may be seen by all Israel." The Targum on Exodus 34:29fr is cited also: "There shone the radiance of his [Moses] features which had come to him from the light of the glory of the shekinah of Yahweh." So Hastings's Dictionary of the Bible: "The conception of the Shekinah appears in Greek dress under the word doxa. In several instances doxa is used of Deity or a manifestation-form of Deity, and thus shows itself to be the equivalent of Shekinah.... In the NT there are several instances in which doxa is used as more or less the equivalent of Shekinah." One example of such equivalence is Hebrews 1:3, where Christ is called "the brightness of his [God's] glory" (AV). The RSV reads: "He reflects the glory of God." Taken word by word, however, the Greek text would read: "who being brightness [reflection] of the glory" (apaugasma tes doxes). (The text of Hebrews 1:3 echoes and recalls the Apocrypha, wherein Wisdom [sophia] is called "the brightness [apaugasma] of the everlasting light" [Wisd. 7:26].) Another example of what Abelson calls "the Schechinah-Presence" (Jewish Mysticism 45) may be this: "when he [Christ] received honour and glory [doxari] from God the Father and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory [megaloprepous doxesY (2 Pet. 1:17; RSV). In James 2:1, according to the AV and the RSV, Christ is "the Lord of glory"; whereas the Greek text reads simply: "Jesus Christ the glory" [Iesou Christou tes doxes]. G H. Dodd's remarks are apposite: The term doxa in Greek means either "opinion" ... or else "reputation," and in particular a good reputation, and so "honour," "distinction." It is still somewhat obscure how the word acquired a new meaning which made it capable of translating the Hebrew kavod, Aramaic jekara. It seems that it does not bear this meaning anywhere except where Jewish influence is probable. Kavod means the manifestation of God's being, nature and presence, in a manner accessible to human experience; and the manifestation was con ceived in the form of radiance, splendour, or dazzling light.... In Judaism of the Christian era, the shekinah ("dwelling," or presence of God) was conceived as light. (206) In the Fourth Gospel, the ordinary Greek use of doxa is com mon ... but in the four places which speak of "seeing" the glory of God or of Christ. .. and in the one place which speaks of "manifesting" the glory ... we must recognize the biblical meaning of the term. In xii.41 we have a reference to the vision of Isaiah described in ch.vi of his book. Isaiah says bluntly, "I saw the</page><page sequence="9">The Shekinah in Jonathan Edwards 9 Lord." John, in accordance with the general tendency of contem porary Judaism, says eiden ten doxan autou [lit. "he saw the glory of him"]. Clearly, therefore, doxa here means the manifestation of God's presence and power, kavod or jekara. So when in xvii.24 Christ prays for his disciples, ina theorosin ten doxan ten emen en dedokas moi oti egapesas me pro kataboles kosmon ["that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given to me because thou didst love me before the foundation of the world"], he is using language of Hebrew ancestry to denote the visio Dei. (207; translation in square brackets added]) * * * Edwards's Dissertation Concerning the End for Which God Created the World, written in 1755, was published in 1765. The following is excerpted from chapter 2: Let us begin with the phrase the glory of god?And here I might observe, that it is sometimes used to signify the second per son in the Trinity; but it is not necessary at this time, to prove it from particular passages of Scripture. Omitting this, I proceed to observe some things concerning the Hebrew word kavod which is most commonly used in the Old Testament, where we have the word glory in the English Bible. . . . The noun kavod signifies grav ity, heaviness, greatness, and abundance. ... (116: 512) The Hebrew word kavod which is normally translated glory, is used in such a manner as might be expected from this signification of the words from whence it comes. Sometimes it is used to signify what is internal, inherent, or in the possession of the person: and sometimes for emanation, exhibition, or communication of this inter nal glory: and sometimes for the knowledge or sense of these, in those to whom the exhibition or communication is made; or an expression of this knowledge, sense, or effect. And here I would note, that agreeable to the use of this word in the Old Testament is the Greek word doxa in the New. For as the word kavod is gen erally translated by the just mentioned Greek word doxa in the Septuagint; so it is apparent, that this word is designed to be used to signify the same thing in the New Testament with the other in the Old. This might be abundantly proved.... (116; 513)</page><page sequence="10">io Early American Literature, Volume 27, igg2 The word glory is used in Scripture often to express the exhibi tion, emanation, or communication of the internal glory. Hence it often signifies an effulgence, or shining brightness by an emanation of beams of light.... But in particular, the word is very often thus used when applied to God and Christ. (117; 516) Key words in Edwards's text are "effulgence," "emanation," "expression": God's glory, Edwards tells us, is "often represented by an effulgence, or emanation, or communication of light, from a luminary or fountain of light. What can so naturally and aptly represent the emanation of the internal glory of God; or the flowing forth and abundant communication of that infinite sense of good that is God? Light is very often in Scripture put for comfort, joy, happiness, and for good in general*" (117-18; 521). The asterisk in Edwards's text sends his reader to the following note: Isa.vi.3.?"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is full [Hebrew melo; LXX pleres] of his glory." In the original, His glory is the fulness of the whole earth: which signifies much more than the words of the translation.... By God's glory here, there seems to be respect to those effulgent beams that filled the temple: these beams signifying God's glory shining forth and communi cated. (118; 52m) Edwards's phrase, "those effulgent beams that filled the temple," recalls the cloud of glory of Exodus 40:35, identified in Work of Redemption with the Shekinah. (A useful gloss on Isaiah 6:3 is found in the Targums, translated throughout, for the present study, by Robert Hayward: "Holy in the highest heaven is the house of his Shekinah. Holy upon the earth is the deed [or work] of his power. Holy throughout the ages is the Lord of Hosts. All the earth is full of the splendour of his glory.") Having linked the divine plenitude with glory, Edwards goes on to link metonymically the name of God with the divine glory, explaining that they often "signify the same thing in Scripture" (118; 523). Whereupon citing passages from Exodus, he alludes directly to the pillar of cloud that "dwelt above the mercy-seat in the tabernacle": And the same illustrious brightness and effulgence in the pillar of cloud that appeared in the wilderness, and dwelt above the mercy seat in the tabernacle and temple, (or rather the spiritual, divine brightness and effulgence represented by it,) so often called the glory of the Lord, is often called the name of the Lord. Because God's</page><page sequence="11">The Shekinah in Jonathan Edwards ii glory was to dwell in the tabernacle. ... In like manner, the name of God is said to dwell in the sanctuary. . . . And in Psal. lxxiv.7. the temple is called the dwelling-place [Heb. mishkan-, LXX skenoma] of God's name. (118; 524) To summarize: according to Edwards, the end or purpose of God's Creation is the glory or name of God communicated; at the same time, the glory of God communicated is the end or purpose of Creation, defined by Edwards as "the emanation and true external expression of God's internal glory and fulness." Creation is the "manifestation of [God's] internal glory to created understandings. The communication of the infinite fulness of God to the creature." On rereading End of Creation, one discovers that in Edwards's layered and m?tonymie scheme, there is an "ultimate end" or "great end" to God's works that is radically related to the divine fiat of Genesis. No matter what that ultimate purpose is called, we are told, all its names are metonymy for the glory of God: For though it [God's ultimate end] be signified by various names, yet they appear not to be names of different things, but various names involving each other in their meaning; either different names of the same thing, or names of several parts of one whole', or of the same viewed in various lights, or in its different respects and relations. (119; 526) Thus we see that the great end of God's works, which is so vari ously expressed in Scripture, is indeed but one; and this one end is most properly and comprehensively called the glory of god; by which name it is properly called in Scripture; and is fitly compared to an effulgence or emanation of light from a luminary. (119; 530) In terms of the discussion below, one fact is central: Edwards considers creation to be the divine fulness or internal glory of God existing ad extra. Expressed otherwise by Edwards, creation is an "emanation of God's glory, or the excellent brightness and fulness of the divinity diffused, overflowing, and as it were enlarged', or in one word, existing ad extra" (119; 527). With the crucial phrase ad extra, Edwards alludes to the doctrine of creatio ex nihilo. * * * In order to arrive at a precise understanding of Edwards's model of creation, it will be useful to examine a typical misunderstanding. Here, for</page><page sequence="12">12 Early American Literature, Volume 27, igg2 example, is Perry Miller's attempt to explicate Concerning the End for Which God Created the World: God did not create the world, said Edwards, merely to exhibit His glory; He did not create it out of nothing simply to show that He could: He who is Himself the source of all being, the substance of all life, created the world out of Himself by a diffusion of Himself into time and space. He made the world, not by sitting outside and above it, by modeling it as a child models sand, but by an exten sion of Himself, by taking upon Himself the forms of stones and trees and of man. He created without any ulterior object in view, neither for His glory nor for His power, but for the pure joy of self-expression, as an artist creates beauty for the sake of beau ty.... If He bothers to create, it is out of the fullness of His own nature. ... Edwards did not use my simile of the artist .., but we may still employ the simile because Edwards invested his God with the sublime egotism of the great artist. (194)11 This is a case of misreading through misremembering. For it is not just the simile of the artist that Edwards does not use. Nowhere in his closely argued End of Creation is there even a hint of God's "taking upon Himself the forms of stones and trees" (Miller's phrasing recalls Wordsworth's Lucy poems). Nor does Edwards once use the word "extension," which to the modern reader recalls Spinoza, and no doubt "pantheism" (whether or not Spinoza's model of emanation is pantheistic). More, Miller's depiction of a Deity "who created the world out of Himself by a diffusion of Himself into time and space" evokes in this context, not Calvin's sense of "diffusion,"12 but the Stoic God, who indeed emanates and generates the world out of his own substance, and who "does so as a material immanent force, a sort of perfectly good and wise gas" (Armstrong 4). * * * If we look closely at Jonathan Edwards, we find that while God's glory and fulness is expressed in and through creation, God is nevertheless undiminished, unchanged, immutable. In fact Edwards is entirely explicit in End of Creation that God's emanation is "ad extra, or without himself (100; 433). To Edwards, creation "implies a being receiving its existence, and all that belongs to it, out of nothing" (97; 420). Once again, the doc trine o?creatio ex nihilo is evoked: the world, including creatures in all their</page><page sequence="13">The Shekinah in Jonathan Edwards 13 complexity, was created out of nothing prior to or other than God?there was no eternal matter at hand from which anything derives. In the words of the Westminster Confession: "It pleased God ... to create, or make of nothing, the world, and all things therein." The first explicit statement we find of creatio ex nihilo (the concept is implicit in Genesis 1, and was so understood by the Rabbis) was recorded about 125 b.c.: I beseech thee, my son, look upon the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, and consider that God made them of things that were not; and so was mankind made likewise. (2 Maccabees 7:28)^ Compare Hebrews 11:3: By faith we understand that the world was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was made out of things which do not appear. (RSV) There is a radical difference between a model of creation whereby all things are produced from "things that were not" (from no thing) and a model whereby all things are produced from God's Substance, or from any pre-existing matter. Nonetheless, when the language of emanation (overflowingness, radiance, streams, fountains, diffusion, and so on) is used to explicate creatio ex nihilo, there is the possibility, even the danger, of confusion. In consequence Edwards, and indeed Calvin, have been accused of verging on pantheism. To paraphrase a warning of Copleston's, all theories of emanation must be interpreted according to the doctrine of creation to which they adhere (466-67). In the context of the present study, one should also be aware that all Edwards's metaphors of emanation must be inter preted with regard to the doctrine of divine generation [gennesis] of the Son from the Father, often described by the early Church Fathers in terms of "light and its radiance, fountain and stream, root and plant" (Ottley 582).14 The word emanation itself is "used by divines to denote 'generation' of Son and 'procession' of Holy Ghost" (OED); its root is the Latin manare, to flow. Creation out of nothing does not mean, as Gnosticism would have it, "that there was once a 'Nothing' out of which God created the world, a negative primal beginning, a Platonic me on, a formlessness, a chaos, a primal Darkness. The 'ex' of the creatio ex nihilo does not suggest any kind of 'matter'?however vague and shadowy?but it means the fact that God alone brought the world into being" (Emil Brunner is here cited [10]). In the doctrine of creatio ex nihilo, there "never was a 'nothing' alongside of</page><page sequence="14">14 Early American Literature, Volume 27, igg2 God, as it were, but God alone," who creates the world through his Word or Wisdom or Torah, not by shaping or "emanating" some aboriginal substance. Compare Psalm 33:9: "For he spake, and it was done." Compare also Ecclesiasticus (Ben Sirach) 43:26: "by his word [logo] all things consist." Likewise Wisdom of Solomon 9:1: "O God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast made all things with thy word [logo]." So the Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch: "When of old there was no world with its inhabitants, thou didst devise and speak with a word, and forthwith the works of creation stood before thee" (14:7; qtd. Hayward 128). To take just one of countless patristic instances, Clement of Alexandria writes: "The Logos issuing forth was the cause of Creation" (Pelikan 189). Implicit in creatio ex nihilo are two radical concepts: first, the world was created by means of the expressed and communicated Word of God; second, the world has a beginning (Gr. En arche; Heb. Bereshith). Greek philosophy, on the other hand, wherein God and matter are coeternal, "knows no beginning of the world" (Brunner 15). Plato, for ex ample (according to St. Athanasius), "said that God had made all things out of pre-existent and uncreated matter, just as the carpenter makes things of wood that already exists." But [Athanasius argues] those who hold this view do not realize that to deny that God is Himself the Cause of matter is to impute limitation to Him, just as it is undoubtedly a limitation on the part of the carpenter that he can make nothing unless he has the wood. (27) Nor in Platonic thought do we come from nothing into being. The most important distinction that must be made between the Platonic and the Judaeo-Christian concepts of being is the way in which being is divided. For Plato, as Andrew Louth has emphasized, the soul was pre-existent and immortal. The most fundamental ontological distinc tion in such a world was between the spiritual and the material. The soul belonged to the former realm in contrast to its body which was material: the soul belonged to the divine, spiritual realm and was only trapped in the material realm by its association with the body. But the doctrine of creation ex nihilo implies that the most fundamental ontological divide is between God and the created order, to which latter both soul and body belong. (76-77; italics added) To posit a "fundamental ontological divide ... between God and the</page><page sequence="15">The Shekinah in Jonathan Edwards 15 created order," and then to imagine, as Jonathan Edwards does, that God's "disposition" is to make himself known "by his words and works, i.e. in what he says and in what he does" (98; 422), suggests that God may somehow bridge that fundamental divide. It further suggests that Edwards, like Calvin and Augustine, views creation as a matter of grace, as "a ... purely superfluous [cf. "overflowing"] expression of pure disinterested generosity" (Armstrong 25). For Edwards, as we have seen, God's purpose in creation is to express himself in order that we might understand Him. ("If it be fit that God's power and wisdom, &amp;c. should be exercised and expressed in some effects, and not lie eternally dormant, then it seems proper that these exercises should appear, and not be totally hidden and unknown" [99; 431]). And that which God expresses, ex nihilo, without himself, is something Edwards terms the "internal glory or fulness." A passage from Ecclesiasticus or Sirach (190 b.c.) is a valuable gloss on Edwards's End of Creation: I will now remember the works of the Lord, and declare the things that I have seen: In the words of the Lord are his works. The sun that giveth light looketh upon all things, and the work thereof is full [pleres] of the glory [doxes] of the Lord. The Lord hath not given power to the saints to declare all his marvellous works, which the Almighty Lord firmly settled, that whatsoever is might be es tablished for his glory [doxe].... He hath garnished the excellent works of his wisdom [sophias], and he is from everlasting to ever lasting: unto him may nothing be added, neither can he be dimin ished. (42:i5f?) That the world is filled with the grandeur of God?that God's grandeur is the fulness of the whole earth?is due to what Edwards calls God's "propensity" or "disposition to cause an emanation of his glory and fulness?which is prior to the existence of any other being" (100; 438). These words allude unmistakably to the doctrine of divine pre-existence. First of all, Edwards's assertion that God's glory and fulness is "prior to the existence of any other being" evokes Wisdom or Hochma of the He brew Scriptures: "The lord by wisdom [hochma] hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens" (Prov. 3:19). The lord possessed me [i.e. hochma] in the beginning [Heb. reshith] of his way, before his works of old. I was set up from ever lasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.... (Proverbs 8:22 f?)</page><page sequence="16">16 Early American Literature, Volume 27, igg2 As given in the New Jewish Publication Society translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, the passage directly above reads: The lord created me at the beginning of His course As the first of His works of old. In the distant past I was fashioned, At the beginning, at the origin of earth. There was still no deep when I was brought forth.. . . When He fixed the foundations of the earth, I was with Him as a confidant. ... Apparently in post-biblical Rabbinic writings, the concept of Hochma tended to merge with the concept of Torah. The famous Midrash on Genesis 1 (Bereshith Rabbah) interprets God's Wisdom or Hochma as the pre-existent Torah, living "with God as with a tutor, reared as it were by the Almighty" (1).15 If we move to Hellenistic Judaism, and trace what R. H. Fuller has called "the hochma-sophia tradition" (96),16 we discover that in the Apocrypha it is Wisdom or Sophia who was created "from the beginning before the world" (Ecclus. 24:9). In the Wisdom of Solomon we read that Sophia "was with thee [God]: which knoweth thy works, and was present when thou madest the world" (9:9). More centrally, Edwards's End of Creation evokes the Logos or Word who was "in the beginning [en arche] with God" (John 1:2); who, like Hochma and Sophia, existed "before the foundation of the world" (John 17:24); and "Who verily was foreordained [foreknown] before the founda tion of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you" (1 Pet. 1:20). Jesus himself speaks of "the glory [doxe] which I had with thee [God] before the world was" (John 17:5). Similarly, in Colossians 1:17, St. Paul declares: "And he [Christ] is before all things, and by him all things consist." Without such background, this remark of Edwards is indecipher able: Whatever that be which is in itself most valuable, and was so origi nally, prior to the creation of the world, and which is attainable by the creation ... that must be worthy to be God's last end in the creation.... (97; 421) Phrased otherwise, God's "last end" in the creation is radically involved with whatever was "most valuable ... prior to the creation of the world." Floated out of its theological context, Edwards's text may well suggest the pre-existence of matter; for in creatio ex nihilo, as we know, there is no thing</page><page sequence="17">The Shekinah in Jonathan Edwards 17 prior to the creation but God himself. That is why any informed reading of Edwards's End of Creation must take into account the doctrine of the pr? existent logos, whereby the Son is present with the Father before the foundation of the world. Formulated in the Nicene Creed: Christ is "Begotten of his Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, Very God of very God, Begotten [gennetos], not made, Being of one substance with the Father, By whom all things were made." Or let us turn to Calvin on "The eternity of the Word": nothing should be more intolerable to us than to fancy a beginning of that Word who both was always God and afterward was the artificer of the universe.... For because something begins to be manifested at a certain time, we ought not therefore to gather that it never existed before. Indeed, I conclude far otherwise: the Word had existed long before God said, "Let there be light" and the power of the Word emerged and stood forth. Yet if anyone should inquire how long before, he will find no beginning... . Therefore we again state that the Word, conceived beyond the beginning of time by God, has perpetually resided with him. (Institutes i.xiii.8) Edwards's view of divine pre-existence is revealed most clearly in his Miscellaneous Observations (pub. 1793), where he maintains that the "works of creation [are] ascribed to Christ." Furthermore, and this is not insignifi cant, Edwards identifies the pre-existent Word with Wisdom or Hochma of the Old Testament: If Christ in the beginning created the heavens and the earth, he must be from eternity; for then he is before the beginning, by which must be meant, the beginning of time; the beginning of that kind of duration which has beginning and following, before and af ter, belonging to it. .. . In Proverbs viii.22. it is said, "The Lord possessed me [i.e. hochma] before his works of old;" and therefore before those works which in Genesis i.i. are said to be made in the beginning. God's eternity is expressed thus, Psalm xc.2. "Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst created the earth and the world, even from everlasting." So it is said, Prov.viii.22. &amp;c. "The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was," &amp;c. (500) In End of Creation are told by Edwards that "the phrase the glory of</page><page sequence="18">18 Early American Literature, Volume 27, igg2 god ... is sometimes used to signify the second person in the Trinity" (116; 512). We are told also: "It is a thing infinitely good in itself, that God's glory should be known by a glorious society of created beings" (99; 431). At this point, if not earlier, one realizes that Edwards's End of Cre ation is a midrash or commentary on Creation in terms of the Incarnation (or on the Logos of Creation in terms of the Incarnate Logos, the Logos of Redemption or Salvation); and also a midrash on the Incarnation in terms of creatio ex nihilo. Jaroslav Pelikan sketches out the typological model that joins Creation with Redemption: As is evident from John 1:3 and its background in Proverbs 8:30, the doctrine of the pr?existent Logos was ... a means of correlating the redemption accomplished in Jesus Christ with the doctrine of Creation. Creation ... revelation ... and redemption could all be ascribed to the Logos." (188) A further aspect of Edwards's End of Creation that needs to be consid ered is how it carefully unravels the language of the Fourth Gospel, especially the proem, which returns us to the beginning of Genesis, to Proverbs, and to the Jewish Apocrypha: In the beginning [En arche] was the Word [logos], and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning [en arche] with God. All things were made [egene to] by him; and without him there was not anything made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light [phos] of men. (John 1:1-4) And the Word [logos] was made flesh, and dwelt [eskenosen cf. skene] among us, and we beheld his glory [doxan], the glory as of the only begotten [monogenous] of the Father, full [pleros] of grace and truth. ... And of his fulness [pleromatos] have we all received, and grace for grace. (1:14, 16) Here is a central but lesser-known passage from Ecclesiasticus (Sirach), one of a series of inter-testamentary writings that lead from the Hebrew Bible into Rabbinic Judaism and into the New Testament: Wisdom [sophia] shall praise herself.... I came out of the mouth of the most High, and covered the earth as a cloud. [Cf. Prov. 2:6: "For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding."] I dwelt [kateskenoma; cf. skene] in</page><page sequence="19">The Shekinah in Jonathan Edwards 19 high places and my throne is in a cloudy pillar.... With all these I sought rest: and in whose inheritance shall I abide? So the Creator of all things gave me a commandment, and he that made me caused my tabernacle [skenen] to rest, and said, Let thy dwelling [kataskenoson] be in Jacob and thine inheritance in Israel. He created me from the beginning before the world and I shall never fail. In the holy tabernacle [skene] I served before him; and so was I established in Sion. (24:1-10) Let us now turn to Edwards's treatment of pleroma, a key word in the proem to the Fourth Gospel that we have so far ignored. The word pleroma means, "that which fills," "fulness," "plenitude": "And the Word ... dwelt among us ... full [pleros] of grace and truth.... of his fulness [pleromatos] have we all received." In Edwards's model of Creation, it is the divine "fulness," the "infinite fulness of all possible good" (99; 432), that is expressed and communicated by God. What seems especially important is that "fulness" and "glory" are closely related: the "emanation of divine fulness" is "called in Scripture, the glory of God" (119; 529). Throughout his End of Creation, Edwards makes a confused (and often confusing) distinction between the internal glory or fulness (which is presumably invisible, just as the divine name is ineffable) and the external fulness?the perceptible glory of God, or in other terms, the glory of the Shekinah. To consider Edwards's invisible-visible model further is to sense that St. Paul is not far away: in Colossians, Christ is called the "image [eikon] of the invisible God" (1:15), just as in the Apocrypha, wisdom is called the eikon of God's goodness (Wisd. 7:26). Edwards's first Miscellany on the Trinity describes the Son as the "express and perfect image of God" (Ramsey 41 42). To follow Edwards further: the visible or external glory of God is the "expression of God's internal glory and fulness": "As there is an infinite fulness of all possible good in God ... and as this fulness is capable of communication, or emanation ad extra; so it seems a thing amiable and valuable in itself that this infinite fountain of good should send forth abundant streams" (99; 433). So far as the stream may be looked upon as anything besides the fountain, so far it may be looked on as an increase of good. And if the fulness of good that is in the fountain, is itself excellent, then the emanation, which is as it were an increase, repetition, or multi</page><page sequence="20">20 Early American Literature, Volume 27, igg2 plication of it is excellent. Thus it is fit, since there is an infinite fountain of light and knowledge, that this light should shine forth in beams of communicated knowledge and understanding [Cf. Prov. 2:6: "out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understand ing."]. . . . And that, as there is an infinite fulness of joy and hap piness, so these should have an emanation, and become a fountain flowing out in abundant beams, as beams from the sun. Thus it appears reasonable to suppose that it was God's last end, that there be a glorious and abundant emanation of his infinite fulness of good ad extra, or without himself; and that the disposi tion to communicate himself, or diffuse his own fulness,* was what moved him to create the world. (100; 433) With the asterisk after the word "fulness," Edwards sends us to an explanatory note: the phrase "God's fulness," he writes, signifies "all the good which is in God natural and moral." As well, St. Paul "often useth the phrase in this sense." So we are referred directly to the divine pleroma (the word appears some dozen times in the Pauline Epistles), conceived by Edwards as something that overflows from God ad extra in the act of creation.17 Already we have seen the words fulness and abundant used by Edwards to describe creation. (1) The world is a "manifestation of [God's] internal glory to created understandings. The communication of the infinite fulness of God to the creature." (2) Creation is an "emanation of God's glory-, or the excellent brightness and fulness of the divinity diffused, overflowing, and as it were enlarged', or in one word, existing ad extra." (3) "What can so naturally and aptly represent the emanation of the internal glory of God; or the flowing forth and abundant communication of that infinite sense of good that is God?" (4) ". . . it seems a thing amiable and valuable in itself that this infinite fountain of good should send forth abundant streams." (5) The Hebrew word "kavod signifies gravity, heaviness, greatness, and abundance." (The words abundance and abundant, cognate with abound, stem from the Latin abundare, "to overflow." Cf. Paul's statement in Philippians 4:18: "But I have all, and abound: I am full [pepleromai].") According to Delling's entry on pleroma and its word group in the Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, the idea of "God as the One who Fills the World" is found in the Old Testament and in post-biblical Judafem. The central text may be Jeremiah 23:24, with its divine assertation: "Do I not fill [male] heaven and earth?" (in the LXX, the Hebrew verb male becomes plero). Of this verse, Delling remarks point</page><page sequence="21">The Shekinah in Jonathan Edwards 21 edly: "the reference is not to the filling of the universe by thepneuma in the Stoic sense of an impersonal material power. God fills the world and he also sustains it." One should compare 1 Kings 8:27: "But will God indeed dwell on earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have built!" The Targum offers a useful and apposite gloss: "God is above all heavens and He upholds the world; they cannot embrace Him. It is His grace, His good pleasure, to let his Shekinah dwell among men." When the Targumists assert that the Shekinah is everywhere, they assert that even the smallest particle of creation reveals the Divine Presence. At no time, however, do they identify God with his creation. He is both here and there, immanent and transcendent. George Foot Moore explicates the Jewish idea of God: In reality God is everywhere present.... Because he is in one place he is no less elsewhere. In R. Levi's comparison: "The taber nacle was like a cave that adjoined the sea. The sea came rushing in and flooded the cave; the cave was filled, but the sea was not in the least diminished. So the tabernacle was filled with the radiance of the divine presence, but the world lost nothing of that pres ence." Another comparison for this all-pervading presence of God in the world is the soul of man. As the soul fills the body, so God fills his world, as it is written, "Do I not fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord." (370) The biblical concept of "God as the One Who fills all things" was taken up by Philo, from whom Delling cites the following: "The whole cosmos ... would not be a place worthy of God, since God is his own place (topos) and is Himself full.... He fills (pleron) and embraces all else, that which is deficient and waste and empty, but he is embraced by nothing." Thus, Delling explains, "In full self-sufficiency God is distinct from the world"; moreover, when Philo "speaks of God as the peplerokos he is describing God as the One who was at work in the creation of the world and who is still at work in its preservation." That is to say, by referring to God as the peplerokos, Philo "is not calling God the world soul. His super-terrestial concept of God prevents him from doing this." If for Philo, God is the One Who fills all things, God is at the same time immutable, undiminished, and outside the world, for there is nowhere in or outside creation where God is not: "for God fills all things and pervades all things, and has left nothing, no matter how solitary, void of himself. What kind of a place can man occupy in which God is not?" (Moore 372). (In this</page><page sequence="22">22 Early American Literature, Volume 27, igg2 context, see Browning's "Saul": "And thy love fill infinitude wholly, nor leave up nor down / One spot for the creature to stand in!" [302-03].) As we have seen, Philo conceives of God in spatial terms: "There I am, and everywhere, Who have filled [pepleroka] all things" (qtd. Montgomery Hitchcock 13). This model of thought may inform Paul's text in Colossians 1:19, cited here in three translations: "For it pleased the Father that in him [Christ] should all fulness dwell" (AV); "For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell" (RSV); "For in him, the complete being of God, by God's own choice, came to dwell" (NEB). All three versions are an ideological gloss on the Greek text, where the words "Father" and "God" do not appear at all. It is simply, as Paul writes, that all the fulness [pan to pleroma] was well pleased to dwell in Christ. Just as the divine pleroma is said to dwell in Christ, so Christ is said to fill all things: "He [Christ] that descended is the same also that ascended ... that he might fill all things" [plerose ta panto] (Eph. 4:10). Compare Colossians 2:9-10: For in him [Christ] dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily [pan to pleroma tes theotetos somatikos]. And you are complete [lit. you have been filled, peploromenot] in him. * * * To conceive spatially of the divine pleroma dwelling in Christ is to recall the point in Edwards's End of Creation where he explains that the Tabernacle and the Temple are "the dwelling-place" of the glory of God and of the divine name: And the same illustrious brightness and effulgence in the pillar of cloud that appeared in the wilderness, and dwelt above the mercy seat in the tabernacle and temple, (or rather the spiritual, divine brightness and effulgence represented by it,) so often called the glory of the Lord, is often called the name of the Lord. Because God's glory was to dwell in the tabernacle. ... In like manner, the name of God is said to dwell in the sanctuary.... And in Psal. lxxiv.7. the temple is called the dwelling-place [mishkan; LXX skenoma] of God's name. (118; 524) Several analogues come to mind, all of them concerned with divine places. (1) As the fulness or pleroma is said to dwell in Christ, so in the</page><page sequence="23">The Shekinah in Jonathan Edwards 23 Hebrew Scriptures, the name and glory of God are said to dwell in the Tabernacle. (2) In the Targums, the glory of the Shekinah dwells in the Tabernacle?see Targum Neofiti on Exodus 25:8: "And they shall build for my name the house of the sanctuary, and I shall cause the glory of my Shekinah to dwell in their midst." (3) In Exodus 40:35, "the glory of the lord [kavod YWHVv] filled [male; LXX pleres] the tabernacle [mishkan]"; whereas in the Targums, it is the glory of the Shekinah that fills the tabernacle: "It was not possible for Moses to enter the mishkan zimna because the cloud of glory was dwelling on it. And the glory of the Shekinah of the Lord filled the mishkan." In the New Testament, the word "tabernacle" or skene becomes metonymy for Christ: in the vision of St. John the Divine, a voice cries out, "Behold, the tabernacle [skene] of God is with men, and he will dwell [skenoset] with them" (Rev. 21:3). One recalls also the well-known connec tion between the second Temple and the "temple" of the body of Christ (see John 2:19-20), itself metonymy for the Church. In Hebrews 9:11, Christ is "a greater and more perfect tabernacle [skenous], not made with hands" (cf. 2 Cor. 1:1-5). So far we are on familiar ground. But what is remarkable about the following excerpt from A History of the Work of Redemption is Edwards's firm conviction that the pre-incarnate Logos "dwelt" in the second Temple "till he came to dwell in human nature": The building of the [second] temple was a great type of... Christ, especially his human nature; of the church; and of heaven... . This was the house where Christ dwelt, till he came to dwell in hu man nature. That his body was the antetype of the temple, appears from what he says, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up," speaking of the temple of his body, John ii.19, 20. (557; 225, italics added) Several pages on, in the passage cited partially on the first page of the present study, Edwards contends that the second Temple, rebuilt in 516 b.c., "was nothing in comparison" with the first: that along with the tablets of the law, and the fire upon the altar, one of the things lacking in the Temple was "the Shechinah, or cloud of glory over the mercy seat" (563; 252-54). Several pages later he remarks: "We before observed ... how the cloud of glory withdrew, before Christ, the brightness of the Father's glory appeared" (566; 269). Still later, we are reminded by Edwards that before the Babylonian captivity, "God used to dwell among them [the Jewish</page><page sequence="24">24 Early American Literature, Volume 27, igg2 people] ... visibly revealing himself to them by the Shechinah ..." (570; 288). One clue to Edwards's model of light-overtaking-light is Haggai 2:9, and God's promise to fill the second Temple with glory: "The glory of this latter house shall be greater than the former, saith the lord of Hosts: and in this place will I give peace...." Read christologically, the verse from Haggai is an accepted prophecy of the Incarnation. Edwards says of the second Temple: "Now that very temple was built that God would fill with glory by Christ's coming into it, as the prophets Haggai and Zechariah told the Jews in order to encourage them in building it" (565; 265). The allusion is to Haggai 1:8 ("build the house ... that I may appear in my glory"), a verse interpreted by the Targumists as: "build the house .. . that I may cause my Shekinah to dwell in it." Now the theological stumbling-block in Edwards's passage cited above is this: for Edwards the rebuilt, second Temple is not simply a type of the Incarnation, but already, five centuries before the birth of Christ, the dwelling-place of the pre-incarnate Christ, who "dwelt" there "till he came to dwell in human nature," or in the "temple of his body." In other words, that the Shekinah or "cloud of glory withdrew" from the first Temple is not only a type or prophecy of the Word made flesh. The withdrawal of the Shekinah also prefigures the indwelling of the pre-incarnate Logos in the second Temple. Rephrased: in Edwards's view, the pre-incarnate Logos has replaced, has taken over the dwelling place (and with it the literary topos) of the Shekinah or Divine Presence, said by "the ancient accounts of the Jews" (Edwards's phrase) to be absent from the second Temple.18 * * * Explicating God's reason for creating the world, Edwards asserts that there is "a communicative disposition in general, or a disposition in the fulness of the divinity to flow out and diffuse itself." This propensity in God to diffuse himself, may be considered as a propensity to himself diffused; or to his own glory existing in its emanation. A respect to himself, or an infinite propensity to and delight in his own glory, is that which causes him to incline to its being abundantly diffused, and to delight in the emanation of it.... (100; 439)</page><page sequence="25">The Shekinah in Jonathan Edwards 25 The verb to diffuse stems from the Latin diffundere, meaning "to pour out or abroad." Likewise in English, diffuse may mean: "to pour or send forth as from a centre of dispersion"; "to spread widely, shed abroad, disperse, disseminate" (OED). In what I take to be a central passage from End of Creation, we learn that God, from his goodness, as it were enlarges himself.... This is by com municating and diffusing himself; and so, instead of finding, he makes objects of his benevolence?not by taking what he finds distinct from himself, and so partaking of their good, and being happy in them, but?by flowing forth, and expressing himself in them, and making them to partake of him, and then rejoicing in himself expressed in them, and communicated to them. (105; 461-62, bold added) Edwards's text is filled with participles (communicating, diffusing, finding, taking, partaking, flowing, expressing, making, rejoicing), all partaking of the nature of adjective and verb and noun, and all imitating the inflowing of the visible glory into creation. Thus one's attention is directed to the role of language itself as the medium of creation. By God's "expressing himself in "objects of his benevolence," and "making them to partake of him," God creates the world. But as we know, in Edwards's model at least, God expresses himself without himself through the agency of his creating and poetic Word. In brief, if the works of God indeed "partake" of divinity, they do so by partaking of God's Word or Wisdom or Torah or Logos. So that as Edwards says, "all that is good and worthy in the object, and its very being" proceed from the emanation and diffusion and overflowing of God's fulness (105; 462). Creation is a superfluity and surplus of divine meaning. To understand Creation as an overflowing, purely ad extra, of the divine fulness and glory is to regard things as partaking of that glory?the glory, that is, not of God, who is invisible, but of his Shekinah. Metonymy is the figure of contiguity, and there can, as we have seen, be no contiguity between the Creator and Creation. The things of the world, then, are not metonymies of God but metonymies of his Shekinah. Neither mediating between Creator and Creation, nor part of Creation, the Shekinah enables the Divine to reveal himself visibly within the space of Creation. All things, for Edwards, can be signs of God's Presence because they participate in what the late Edmond Jab?s, in a visionary gloss on the Shekinah, named "His dazzling absence" (228).</page><page sequence="26">26 Early American Literature, Volume 27, igg2 NOTES A note of gratitude: the present study, written during my tenure as Macmillan Fellow at St. Chad's College, University of Durham, was both inspired and informed by a course in post-biblical Judaism given by Dr. Robert Hay ward of the Department of Theology.

The first number refers to The Works of Jonathan Edwards (1837) edited by Edward Hickman. The second number refers to The Works of Jonathan Edwards (1957-) in the new Yale edition. I use the 1837 Hickman edition throughout, and cite the Yale edition for the conve nience of my readers. 2. Jerusalem Talmud Ta'anith 65a; Babylonian Talmud Yoma 21a; 52b; 9b. To cite the entry on Shekinah in Hastings's Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics (Vol. 11): "The Rabbis affirm that the Shekinah first presided in the Tabernacle prepared in the wilderness by Moses, into which it descended on the day of its consecreation, into the figure of a cloud." The imagined absence of the Shekinah is based upon the Rabbis' interpretation of Haggai 1:8. See also the Introduction to Lamentations Rabbah XXIV: "No sooner was the Temple burnt than the Holy One (blessed be He) said: Now will I withdraw my Schechinah from it and I will go up to my former habitation" (qtd. Abelson, Jewish Mysticism 69). 3. Writing on Edwards's Work of Redemption, several scholars have discussed his use of biblical typology; see, for example, John F. Wilson. None of the studies I have seen, however, takes any notice of Edwards's Shekinah-Christ typology. 4. Mardi 636. The word "Shekinah" appears in Clarel (IV.ix.47) and in Melville's poem "In the Desert." Under "Shekinah" in the OED Melville is not cited. 5. The OED cites the first line of Wesley's hymn?"Arise my Soul Arise"?but not its title. Verse 6 of "Hymn on the Titles of Christ" reads: "Our eyes on earth survey / The Dazzling Shechinah). / Bright, in endless glory bright, / Now on earth He stoops to dwell, / God of God, and Light of Light, / Image of the Invisible." Verse 7 begins: "He shines on earth adored, / The Presence of the lord." According to my colleague Dr. Margaret Procter, who kindly provided me with the complete text of Wesley's hymn, verse 6 is almost always omitted from modern hymn books. 6. Readers wishing to consult the Targums might note that the publishers T &amp; T Clark (Edinburgh) have announced the publication of The Aramaic Bible: The Targums. Ten volumes have appeared so far, translated by such experts as Martin McNamara, Bernard Grossfeld, Robert Hayward, and Michael Maher. 7. For the translations of the Aramaic Targums, and for the translations and transliterations from the Hebrew Bible, I am entirely indebted to Dr. Hayward.</page><page sequence="27">The Shekinah in Jonathan Edwards 27 Quotations from the Old and New Testaments and from the Apocrypha are cited according to the Authorized or King James Version (AV) unless the sense of the passage demands the Revised Standard Version (RSV). 8. See the entry on Shekinah in Hastings's Dictionary of the Bible (1902): "Under the conception that 'God is Light,' the Shekinah is God's mere 'manifestation form.' " 9. The phrase is taken from Abelson's entry on Jewish mysticism in Hastings's Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics. The entry can be found under "Mysticism." 10. The entry continues: "Thus according to Luke ii.9 the 'glory of the Lord' [doxa Kyrios] shone round about them." To the passage from Luke, the author compares 2 Peter 1:17; Ephesians 1:6; 2 Corinthians 4:6. 11. To cite (approvingly) Stephen J. Stein: "Miller's discomfort with Reformed orthodoxy and his personal inclination toward the naturalism of the Enlightenment blinded him to certain traditional theological patterns. He wrenched Edwards out of context, ignoring the primary commitments the latter had made to Reformed dogmatics, scriptural interpretation, and the collective experience of the faithful. Instead, he attempted to create an image of the New England minister that could inspire 'a generation facing an anxious future' at the middle of the twentieth century. Miller succeeded in that objective, perhaps even beyond his own expectations, but at considerable cost to the accuracy of his portrait. The Edwards emerging from his pages is a modern intellectual hero. ..." In Stein's view, "Miller, Ola Winslow, and other interpreters were altogether uncomfortable with Edwards's theology?in large part ... because they misunderstood it" (xi, xxiii). Convinced that "Edwards was first and last a Calvinist theologian," Conrad Cherry alludes to those who "still feel uncomfortable with Edwards's Calvinism. To alleviate the pain of embarrassment, features of Edwards' thought are frequendy searched out which 'transcend' his Calvinism or which prefigure the post-Puritan era of American thought" (6, 2). In his Introduction to Edwards's Ethical Writings, Paul Ramsey re minds us: "it is a grave error ... to separate Edwards's philosophy from his theology" (h). 12. According to Calvin: "For it is the Spirit who, everywhere diffused, sustains all things, causes them to grow, and quickens them in heaven and in earth. Because he is circumscribed by no limits, he is excepted from the category of creatures; but in transfusing into all things his energy, and breathing into them essence, life, and movement, he is indeed plainly divine" (138; italics added). 13. See Edwards's allusions to Maccabees in Work of Redemption, Sermon Twelve. To cite Ramsey's footnote to the relevant passage: "Much of the material in this section refers to events described in the apocryphal books of I and II Maccabees. Although JE would have viewed these books as noncanonical, he took them to be historically reliable" (274J1, Yale ed.). 14. See Edwards's End of Creation: "But the diffusive disposition that excited God to give creatures existence was rather a communicative disposition in general, or a disposition in the fullness of divinity to flow out and diffuse itself. Thus the disposition there is in the root and stock of a tree to diffuse and send forth its sap and life, is doubtless the reason of the communication of its sap and life to its buds, leaves and fruits, after these exist" (435, Yale ed.). Of God's "delight in the emanation" of his own glory, Edwards says: "Thus that nature in a tree, by which it puts forth buds,</page><page sequence="28">28 Early American Literature, Volume 27, igg2 shoots out branches, and brings forth leaves and fruit. . . . And so the disposition in the sun to shine, or abundandy to diffuse its fullness ..." (439, Yale ed.). In his notes to Ethical Writings, Ramsey cautions the reader "not to overlook references to the Trinity in both End of Creation and True Virtue" (432n, Yale ed.). 15. Compare Edwards's Work of Redemption, Sermon Nine: "The church under the Old Testament was a child under tutors and governors and God dealt with it as a child" (230, Yale ed.). The Midrash to Genesis 1 explains: "Thus God consulted the Torah and created the world, while the Torah declares, in the beginning god created (I, I) beginning referring to the Torah, as in the verse, The Lord made me as the beginning of His way (Prov. VIII, 22)" (1). 16. Fuller's discussion of the hochma-sophia tradition should be consulted by anyone concerned with the background of the logos doctrine. According to Fuller, the con cept o? sophia "offered the possibility of an interpretation of Christ as the pre-existent agent of creation" (75). "Both Philo and the Book of Wisdom witness to a gradual substitution within Hellenistic Judaism of the term logos for sophia" (76). As Fuller points out, the proem to the Fourth Gospel "borrows from the sophia myth but goes beyond it" (208). Which is to say: "Down to v. 13 there is nothing which could not have been derived from the sophia-logos myth" (226). That the Redeemer should be God incarnate, however, is "without precedent" (210). 17. According to Paul Ramsey's notes to End of Creation, the biblical concept of pleroma "concretely exhibited the oneness JE sought between God's will to com municate himself and his will to himself communicated, between his effectual fullness and his fullness in effect, between Christ and the church ..." (432n). 18. After the present essay on Edwards and the Shekinah was out of my hands, a review copy of Edward Taylor's recently discovered sermons, Upon the Types of the Old Testament, came into them. The Shekinah appears in his sermon on "Tabernacle and Temple," written in 1696. Explicating the typological/Christological significance of "Tabernacle" and of "Temple," and alluding to the Hebrew Bible and the Septuagint, Taylor remarks to his parishioners: "When the Tabernacle was erected, &amp; anointed, the Cloud of Divine Majesty Covered it, &amp; the Glory of the Lord filled the house Exo. 4.2.34.35. And so it was also at the Consecration of the Temple I Kin. 8. and so Gods Presence ever did abide here in them. Which holds out to us that upon the very formation &amp; erecting of the Tabernacle of Christs Human Nature the Shecinah or Divine Majesty of God did Personaly reside in it. Hence in him dwells the fulness of the Godhead bodily Col. 2. 9" (1:419). Taylor also makes the con nection between the Hebrew shakan and mishkan and the Greek skene, noting that "the Tabernacle or Temple imports a house in which God doth in Some Speciall way make his dwelling place" (1:412). The editor of these sermons, Charles W. Mignon, provides no explanatory note to Taylor's use of the word "Shecinah," nor is the word listed in the General Index. Moreover, because the Hebrew and Greek terms are not transliterated, most readers will not know that shakan, skene, and Shekinah are related by a remarkable coincidence of sound.
