The reviewer of art books in the Bollinger Series is in the same precarious position as the bride on her wedding night, if not the bride in Du- champ's "The Bride Laid Bare at Her Bachelor's Even." The spaces are private, but cliche has so transformed a socially intimate occasion into a public ritual that the distinguished performers and the audience each has difficulty knowing the lengths to which an idea might be sustained before both are free to fall asleep. Like the bridal suite, the surroundings are always lux- urious (the reproductions are invariably of excellent quality and the sheets are handsomely printed), but, more often than not, the conver- sation borders on the trite and the sentiment seems a bit worn as ritual is converted to myth. And, one suspects that the institution rather than the people are to blame; both Cecil and Praz are knowledgeable men, yet little of their learning comes through in these two books. If one compares the level of accomplishment in these A. W. Mellon Lectures with a similar fete in literary criticism, say, the Christian Gauss Seminars, the state of art criticism comes in a very poor second. But perhaps that very com- parison tells us something about the aesthetic sensibility operative in art and literary criticism, respectively. David Cecil's Visionary and Dreamer is an at- tempt by a distinguished literary critic to come to terms with two poetic painters, Samuel Palmer and Edward Burne-Jones. It fails both in conception and execution. The topic itself is a good one, but even the casual reader wonders why these two painters were chosen rather than, say, Blake and Simeon Solomon. Since his choice is not argued, one can only assume that his explanation-"literary painting is out of fashion nowadays"-is in fact a fortui- tous justification. Cecil explains the great popu- larity of the poet-painter in the nineteenth century as a typically romantic reaction to a previous neoclassical style: Eighteenth-century painting was social and extroverted: Hogarth and Gainsborough were concerned to depict the contemporary scene. The Romantic Movement-this is its dis- tinguishing characteristic, so far as England was concerned-turned the eyes of the artist inwards. Its subject is the inner life, the raptures and fears and aspirations and fanta- sies of the soul in solitude. (Prologue, p. 3) This sort of fuzzy, generalized conceptualization would be bad enough as is, but the premise from which it springs is even more patently false. The great English poet-painters of the nineteenth century-Crome, Blake, Rossetti, Beardsley- were scarcely popular among contemporaries and even Millais obtained some renown only after he had abandoned the aims of the first generation Pre-Raphaelites. As early as 1805, an auction at the Boydell Shakespeare Gallery of paintings in the "grand style," given its raison d'etre by Sir Joshua Reynold's Discourses, brought extremely little monetary return. This shift in public taste occurred in the year of Samuel Palmer's birth, yet the burden of Cecil's argument would have us believe that his career was aesthetically revolutionary, influenced as it was by Blake. The "inner" life is the predominant metaphor which the late Professor Cecil utilizes to link Palmer and Edward Burne-Jones. And, from time to time it betrays him. Palmer's imagination is always illuminated by "strange lights" (p. 37); his scenes are "mysterious" (p. 65); and the creative spirit "possessed him" (p. 71). As evoca- tive as such language might be on the lecture circuit, it serves to cloud a serious consideration of Palmer the painter. In short, because Cecil refers all that he cannot explain away to Palmer's mysticism, he does for a superb painter what pre-Northrop Frye literary critics did for Blake-that is to say, the artist comes off as a</page><page sequence="2">258 crank. We often excuse our own inability to come to terms with an artist or a thinker by the accusation of temporary insanity which pre- sumably prompts some interior vision. The shoe of temporary insanity, heightened by the hint that Palmer had strange religious experiences, probably belongs on the other foot. The very early Palmer, from the pages of the "Irving" Sketchbook of 1824, consists of the juxtaposition of two almost incompatible strokes: the heavy line of India ink which over- lays pencil underdrawing and the wash of pale blue watercolor that graces the upper third of the picture. He seems far more interested, at least as a teenager, in tone rather than hue-a characteristic which makes for a constant muted- ness of aesthetic statement. It combines most conspicuously with the cartoon characteristics of the India ink. A Study for a Crucifixion Scene: Bad Thief (1824) superimposes a tor- mented human body upon a gnarled tree trunk in a testicular shape. This anthropomorphic prospect always seems coiled and ready to spring upward, so that almost all the horizontal land- scapes appear as vertical. Even the marvelous landscapes of 1826-1832 combine a mixture of pen and brush in sepia which is then mixed with gum and varnished, almost as if Palmer was regressively attempting to recapture the dark bituminous washes of eighteenth-century style prior to pushing the particular medium ahead into the late engravings. There would also appear to be some evolution in Palmer's spaces. The sweep becomes ever more circular so that the limiting planes are in- variably arcs that circumscribe some inner or sacred space near the geometric center of the sketch or painting. And there is more often than not a road or path which is guarded by a gate or tall tree (or the twin trees of life and death) and which opens out into the viewer's space. Once we get beyond the initial barrier, however, the per- ceiver becomes in effect a pilgrim to a strange kingdom, often on a different plane, illuminated by a mist-shrouded moon. Often, the moon flattens or interacts with the wispy clouds around it to become a large, illuminated white cloud or its terrestrial counter image, the white blooming tree. With the Study of a Garden at Tintern (1835), Palmer flattens his surfaces to produce the body color of brown, grainy hue that re- sembles not just a little, a lunar surface. There are other hints that Palmer's background and foreground exchange relative spatial positions, as if to suggest that at least in terms of his own career, the inhabitant of Shoreham had at last come to terms with the ethereal lunar cosmology, REVIEW S usually effected on buff paper in an ever more Turneresque manner. The second half of Mr. Cecil's book deals with the second generation Pre-Raphaelite, Ed- ward Burne-Jones, another symbolist painter whose imaginative flights have recently been detailed in the travelling exhibit, The Sacred and Profane in Symbolist Art, organized by Luigi Carluccio. Again, Cecil's treatment is al- most entirely biographical with no attention at all to the important questions prompted by the art itself. Why, for example, does Burne-Jones' imagination move from the mythological subject matter of the Perseus series to the late cartoons, a striking reversal from the general develop- mental pattern of Palmer's art? In spite of Mr. Cecil's unquestionable knowledge of Victorian literature, nowhere does he mention those curious cultural connections which Burne-Jones' subject matter suggests. Why, for example did the St. George myth have great fascination for men of such diverse sensibilities as Burne-Jones, Browning, and Hopkins? Much of the commen- tary in the second half of Yisionary and Dreamer has the effect of placing Burne-Jones in the company of the first generation PRB: Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Rather than imagining himself as some rebel against eighteenth-century mannerism, Burne-Jones was by comparison firmly en- trenched in a certain fin-de-siecle establishment. As a matter of fact, a great deal of his art ap- pears self-consciously parodic of those familiar Pre-Raphaelite trademarks: the "stunner"; the flattened perspective; and the window through which someone is always peeping. Many of his oils (particularly those done on panels) depict a hermaphroditic figure to the side of some heavy door which leads outward to an arena of po- tential or actual violence. The position of the viewer of the painting is then at double remove from the ritual arena, a feature that helps us to participate in a process of deindividuation that is a corollary to voyeurism. More often than not, one of the human figures in his paintings is her- self an artist, or at least some sort of trans- formationalist, a Circe, a Merlin, or the Muses on Mount Helicon. The juxtaposition of a fig- ure who specializes in metamorphosis (some in- terior artist as it were) with the outer spaces of threatened violence recapitulates the larger spatial configuration of fin-de-siecle art with its ever thicker frames whose ornate serpentine lines separate inner from outer spaces. Mario Praz takes as his subject the parallel between literature and the visual arts, a topic that has been treated historically by Jean Hag-</page><page sequence="3">Reviews strum. But Praz, who chairs the Department of English Language and Literature at the Uni- versity of Rome, is less interested in the parallels of theme and inspiration than he is in the air de famille between the expression of the arts in any given epoch. For Praz, each epoch has "its pe- culiar handwriting or handwritings, which, if one could interpret them, would reveal a charac- ter, even a physical appearance." Hence the kin- ship of literature and painting rests on this premise: a work of art, either visual or literary, must almost deterministically use the distinctive "handwriting" of its particular age. The likeness between the arts within various periods of his- tory can ultimately be traced to structural simi- larities that, and this is the rub, arise out of the characteristic way in which the people of a certain epoch see and memorize facts aesthet- ically. For example, in his first chapter, "Ut Pictura Poesis," Praz notices the similarities be- tween the poems of James Thomson, the cele- brated inventor of the romantic landscape, and the themes common to seventeenth-century landscape painters like Claude Lorrain and Salvator Rosa. Nature came to be organized around personifications which became the focal point of the scene. This technique is seen to be a corollary to the style of those seventeenth-cen- tury masters who used the natural scene as a manifestation of heroic, pastoral, or religious ideals, so that Guido Reni's famous ceiling with the fresco of Aurora is seen to resemble the passage on the advent of Summer, of the "parent of seasons," in Thomson's poem. Unfortunately, Praz is engaging in a kind of low-grade icono- graphic study that poses as structuralism. He confuses in the process the bricoleur with brico- lage, to borrow from the movement's founder, Claude Levi-Strauss. Referring all similarities in structure to some vague concept that is "in the air" at a particular period, he fails to delve into the configuration of a particular metaphoric "world" that might more convincingly link the metaphysical intimacy of style to consciousness. A particular Zeitgeist is not an explanation of the "morphology of the arts." This is not to say that some of the individual observations are not exciting. In chapter III, "The Curve and the Shell," Praz notes the relationship between architecture and costume; that is, public and private styles. During the period when mannerism prevails in literary and artistic expressions, he notices that the prevalence of unadorned black in men's dress throughout the sixteenth-century in Italy and Spain corresponds to the ideals of gravity and majesty advocated for prose-the number- 259 less cases in Italian literature, and in English in the writings of Milton, Taylor, Bacon, Hooker, and the Bible translations. Diagonals, so prominent earlier during the Renaissance, are replaced by horizontals and verticals. Angular folds are broken abruptly and crevices and fur- rows are deepened. As perceptive as he is in ob- serving underlying structures, the author of Mnemosyne often goes far astray when he uses compositional devices to support an emotional tension: Light playing on certain singled-out points of a scene has a dramatic effect similar to wit, insofar as it creates a tension, and dramatic contrasts. The painter manipulating light can be likened to an alchemist bent on finding the philosopher's stone... He then proceeds to quote lines from Ben Jon- son's The Alchemist. This sort of criticism is simply sloppy; the same allegation could be made about the artist's manipulation of point- of-view or, for that matter, any other magic which recurrently transforms. It is something like the literary critic who yokes images of a donut and the washer in terms of their emo- tional affect in, say, the novels of Faulkner. Yes, they do share a certain structure, but that struc- ture may or may not approximate the structures of consciousness. A common feature of baroque decoration, ac- cording to the author, is the abolition of normal limits for a given motif, which can be made as big or as small as one likes. He observes a predi- lection for the curve as evident in costume, both in the shape of the garments themselves and in the emphasis on volume: to his eyes, wigs, breeches, and sleeves all speak a curvilinear language. The structural history of baroque decoration moves from the unique arcs of seven- teenth-century seascapes to Marino's magic gardens with their shell-like vaults, to Piranesi's self-reflexive, hallucinatory spiral staircases whereby the arc has become a serpentine line. It is only when Praz attempts to move from the analysis to some sort of emotional correlative that the book really disappoints. One perception in Praz's Mnemosyne deserves special attention, if for no other reason than because the topic could well be a book in itself. In the second chapter, "Time Unveils Truth," he turns his attention briefly to forged art and specifically, to the way in which fakery tells us how the contemporaries, devotees of Mnemo- syne, regarded their own aesthetic accomplish- ments. It is the one medium through which art</page><page sequence="4">260 might take a look itself. Citing the famous de- scription of St. Mark's given by Ruskin in The Stones of Venice with its emphasis upon amplifi- cations and embroideries and its concern with external surfaces, Praz is convinced that such aesthetic judgments help us to explain a number of characteristic features of late Victorian de- sign, the most important of which is the contrast between empty interiors and the ornate "busy" fructification that takes place on the surface. Although Ruskin had all sorts of hang-ups over "sacred spaces" (including that of his estranged wife), the author moves toward talking of the various modes of structural transference in the visual arts. The problem, of course, is that Rus- kin's observations comprise one form of self- consciousness and the famous art forgeries are quite different. Is there not some ontology of fakery? Is not modern art with its emphasis upon technology and its accentuation of art's self- immunity (which springs paradoxically from an easy proliferation in multiples) in one sense re- sponsible for coopting the "reasonable facsim- ile?" If one adds another Jackie to Warhohl's Sixteen Jackies, does it tell us anything of the sort that Praz intimates? One supposes that like most of us he is smothered in the "put on." There is a noticeable weakness whenever he at- tempts to apply his theories to an art more con- temporary than surrealism. Recognizing, after Antonio Russi, the inca- pacity of aesthetic memory to be realized on the level of the senses, the author of Mnemosyne suggests that every work of art is an allusive ob- ject. The various arts do not interact as the senses do, but he rather sees each art as opera- tive only in its proper "field." He sees all the arts-music, dance, poetry, collage-as only hampering each other whereas in what he calls "sensorial experience" some aesthetic reenforce- ment takes place. With this in mind, his last chapter, "Spatial and Temporal Interpenetra- tion", should be apocalyptic. But it seems curi- ously out-of-date. By pluridimensionality, he re- fers primarily to the interaction of dream psychology, surrealism, and what literary critics would call ambiguity. Nowhere is there the kind of relational statement that would show us an ever-enlarging canvas that finally becomes con- tinuous with the wall until it laps around the corners of the room, producing an environment where space and time do interpenetrate in some way other than intellectually, the sad burden of Professor Praz's book. JAN B. GORDON State University of New York at Buffalo REVIEWS PALMER, RICHARD E. Hermeneutics, Interpreta- tion Theory in Schleiermacher, Dilthey, Hei- degger and Gadamer. Northwestern Univ. Press, 1969, pp. xviii + 283, $9.00. What is the meaning of criticism, and with what does criticism bring us into contact? This is the question Palmer asks in a work which analyses how the art of interpretation contributes to the understanding of the experience of literature. He traces the development of hermeneutic the- ories and expounds in varying detail the con- tributions made by the German thinkers Schleiermacher, Dilthey, Heidegger and Gada- mer. In the last section of the volume, marked by the challenging title "A Hermeneutical Man- ifesto to American Literary Interpretation," Palmer formulates his own views on how the endeavors of interpretation can become more meaningful to and for both critics and readers. Palmer also formulates answers to the reflective questions which form the basis of the study and which European critics have been asking for several decades now: What is understanding? How are we to understand a literary text in an articulate way? What is a literary work? Although hermeneutics has undergone changes of varying degree from its 19th-century begin- nings up until today, it has basically revolved around the effort to formulate the conditions under which the human act of understanding and the emergence of meaning are possible. The four thinkers whom Palmer studies all hold that the critic's "act of understanding" consists in perceiving relations between separate parts and tying these into a meaningful whole. For Schleiermacher, referred to as the father of modern hermeneutics, interpretation meant "to be related to the concrete, existing, acting hu- man being in the process of understanding dia- logue." With Dilthey hermeneutics became the basis of all the disciplines which concern them- selves with human understanding and expres- sion. Dilthey saw understanding occurring within the hermeneutical circle: "The whole receives its definition from the parts, and, re- ciprocally, the parts can only be understood in reference to the whole ... meaning is what un- derstanding grasps in the essential reciprocal interaction of the whole and the parts." Whereas for Dilthey and Scheiermacher read- ing and interpreting meant tying things to- gether, for Heidegger hermeneutics takes on another dimension and comes into closer associ- ation with the philosophical task. Understand- ing is for Heidegger what he calls an existential mode and he believes that it would be an error to construe the literary work as an object which</page></plain_text>
