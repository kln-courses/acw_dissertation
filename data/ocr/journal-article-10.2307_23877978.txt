<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger of San Francisco on Jews and Judaism: The Implications of the Pittsburgh Platform By Marc Lee Raphael Of the leading Reform rabbis in the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Jacob Voorsanger is prob ably the least known of all. Rabbis Wise and Philipson of Cincinnati, Krauskopf of Philadelphia, Hirsch and Stolz of Chicago, and Silver man and Kohler of New York are well-known to students of American Jewish history, whereas Voorsanger, and West Coast rabbis in gen eral, have been grossly neglected. And yet, Voorsanger was any thing but ignored by his contemporaries. Rabbi of the largest and wealthiest congregation in the West (more than 500 families were affiliated with San Francisco's Temple Emanu-El in 1902), Professor of Semitic Languages and Literatures at the University of California at Berkeley from the inception of the chair in 1894 until his death in 1908, chaplain and Annual Lecturer in Old Testament in the Dept. of Bionomics at Leland Stanford Jr. University, founder and editor of San Francisco's Jewish weekly newspaper Emanu El, translator of Obadiah and Jonah in the 1917 Jewish Publication Society edition of the Holy Scriptures, author of several books, and a member of the Board of Directors of numerous religious, philan thropic and civic organizations, Voorsanger's "good works had made the whole city, not only the Jewish citizens, his debtor."1 A descendant of several generations of German rabbis, Jacob Voorsanger was born in Amsterdam, Holland in 1852. He came to the United States after completing his rabbinical education at the Amsterdam Jewish Theological Seminary in 1872. He was married in 1873 and subsequently awarded a D.D. degree from the Hebrew Union College. Voorsanger occupied the pulpit of B'nai Israel Congregation in Philadelphia from 1873-76, resigning when the congregation could no longer afford him. He "officiated on trial" as 1 Martin A.

C., in 1876, was elected, and remained there for one year. He later described the congregation as consisting of "a few people who worshipped in a little synagogue." From Washington he went to Providence (1877-78) and then to Houston (1878-86), the latter containing a Jewish population of 500 in 1877 and a Temple (and grounds) which cost $25,000. In 1886 he accepted a call to Emanu E1 as Elkan Cohn's assistant, became his successor in 1889, and remained Emanu-El's rabbi until his death.2 Voorsanger "wrote correspondences" for the American Israelite (Cincinnati) and Jewish Progress (San Francisco) under the pseu donym of "Koppel von Vloomburg," edited the New Orleans Jewish South (1881-1883), and edited as well as wrote many features for the Sabbath "Visitor (Cincinnati) from 1883-1886. The latter was a rather large weekly for "Jewish Sabbath-schools" and the "instruc tion of young Israel at large," and contained the first draft of Voor sanger's Moses Mendelssohn, Life and Works. He edited the Jewish Progress from September 15, 1893 to February 8, 1895, founded the Emanu El in November, 1895, and remained editor of the latter un til his death. Voorsanger's "Weekly Chats" and published lectures, his European and national news coverage, and particularly his ability to convince the finest Jewish scholars in America to write articles for the newspaper, all combined to make Emanu El, during Voor sanger's lifetime, one of the most articulate weeklies in American Jewish life.3 The Rev. Dr. Jacob Voorsanger also taught in the Semitics De partment of the University of California at Berkeley. During the course of one academic year (1898-99), he offered lectures on "The History of Semitic Nations and Languages," taught Hebrew Exegesis utilizing 2nd Isaiah, and instructed in Pirke Aboth.4 2 American Israelite [ = AT], August 25, September 8, September 22, 1876; EE, May 20, 1898, p. 5; Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger, "Correspondence," American Jewish Archives; Con ference of Rabbis of Southern Congregations, Box No. 2305, American Jewish Archives; American Jewish Year Book 5664 (Philadelphia: 1903), p. 104.

The sugges tion of two Isaiahs was relatively mild compared to Voorsanger's considering, at various times, the non-existence of Ezra, a Mac cabean dating for Daniel, and the Gospels as midrash. His 1904 Stanford lectures even hint at a "power-politics" interpretation of Old Testament preservation and canonization, not seriously de veloped until 1971 in Morton Smith's Palestinian Parties and Politics that Shaped the Old Testament.5 Nor did Voorsanger, unlike the preceeding generation of German Jewish preachers in America, "shy away from political and other controversial issues." He attacked with frenzy, in his sermons and editorials, Zionism, open immigration, Orthodoxy, ritual, the Philip pine War, imperialism, legalism, socialism, materialism, Edward Bellamy, Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch, the Democratic Party, and his local Orthodox colleagues.6 In addition to biblical criticism, nineteenth century Reform Juda ism was also an important influence on Voorsanger. His interpreta tion of Reform virtually rested upon the Pittsburgh Platform of November, 1885, the major articulation of American Reform rabbis. The Platform itself included eight major planks, proclaiming in Kaufmann Kohler's words "what Judaism is and what Reform Juda ism means and aims at." Upon this well-constructed scaffolding did Voorsanger put both feet forward. We hold that the modern discoveries of scientific researches in the domains of nature and history are not antagonistic to the doctrines of Judaism, the Bible reflecting the primitive ideas of its own age and at times clothing its conception of Divine Providence and justice dealing with man in miraculous narratives. (Pittsburgh Platform) The last decades of the nineteenth century witnessed the whole hearted acceptance of the Darwinian theory of evolution by pro gressive American theologians, both Christian and Jewish.

Influenced, according to his own words, by nineteenth century critical biblical scholarship and by Darwin's studies in evolutionary philosophy, he strongly rejected any notion of supernatural revelation, and magnificently adjusted Jewish the ology to the accepted scientific theories of his day. "No man with a logical mind finds any difficulty in accepting the law of evolution as a competent expression of the divine order of things." Under standing revelation, he wrote, means "removing from it all elements of supernaturalism," and he described Judaism as "divinely evolved" rather than divinely revealed. What then constituted the content of revelation? Revelation was the "natural process" through which thoughts of the divine were generated in men. Revelation in no way attested to the reality of the supernatural but merely to "conceptions of the eternal" and the "power of God in man." Examples of revela tion which appeared frequently in Voorsanger's writings included the "progress of the ages," the "march of mankind" towards mono theism, and the "operations of nature." Miracles, in particular, were "the voice of God." Whether "poetic representations of the slow-going processes of change," or, as Voorsanger more frequently thought of them, "brilliant metaphors," miracles also stimulated thoughts about God.7 These thoughts, whatever their source, had an evolutionary de velopment paralleling the "gradual progress of the world's mental ity." Man's thoughts of God grew to the extent that man reveals a capacity to understand; "as his intelligence grows so grows his God." Sinaitic revelation was "the last stage of an interminable series of mental struggles" among Israelite minds, and the under standing of this "human agency" clearly depended upon man's intelligence rather than God's "outpouring." Sinai then only be came possible when men's minds were ready, and it was the "purest form of human consciousness of God." Revelation too, clearly per ceived, was the saga of the "growth of the human consciousness of God." To drive this concept deep into the minds of his contem poraries Voorsanger would speak only of the "Sinaitic evolution" â€” never of Sinaitic revelation â€” and of "progressive revelation." By the latter he meant a gradual but continuous growth in the Jewish understanding of the Deity from animism to a concept of a "pure 7 "The Rise of Man," EE, April 10, 1896, pp. 8-10 and April 17, 1896, pp. 9-12; "The Framework of the Old Testament," EE, October 14, 1904, p. 7.

The God of the people, obviously, remained the same, but the "Jewish mentality" was progressive. Thus the gradual perfec tion of human life revealed how much God grew in man's mind; for "as man grows so grows his God."8 We recognize in the Bible the record of the consecration of the Jewish people to its mission as priest of the One God. (Pittsburgh Platform) Perhaps the most important doctrine in Voorsanger's conception of Judaism was his view of the mission of Israel, for here lay the basic justification for the preservation of Judaism in the Diaspora. Voorsanger could negate Jewish nationalism while affirming the need for complete assimilation (except religion) into the American fabric. Judaism was "a world-embracing system" and its mission, the spreading and the inculcation of "eternal truth," was "perpetual." This eternal truth was ethical monotheism (the "prophetic mission" and "universal prophetic Judaism"), of which the Jews were the "teachers." Judaism had, throughout its history, championed a "moral and mental revolution" against the unethical and irrational" (synonyms for Voorsanger) or against "paganism." The Maccabees, for example, represent the "revolt of Israel against paganism; the revolt of a thousand years, inaugurated by prophets and seers, con tinued by scribes and priests, a paganism beautiful in exterior aspect but whose fatal defect is that it lacks moral standards." And the battle continued to the contemporary world since the world "retains the leaven of its pagan influence." Fortunately, monotheism's mis sion was successful in overthrowing idols and it will "again prove victorious in rooting up the remains of pagan influence."9 We recognize in Judaism a progressive religion, ever striving to be in accord with the postulates of reason. (Pittsburgh Platform) Voorsanger's age was one of either-or: rational religion or irreli gion. Paganism was Voorsanger's label for both unethical and irra tional religion. The term was used not so much for the belief in a 8 "The Framework of the Old Testament," EE, October 14, 1904, p. 7; EE, Febru ary 11, 1898, p. 5; "Quo Vadis, Domine?"

To speak of God in human terms or even to define him was unbecoming; "the Bible contains not a single definition of God" and thus, "in Judaism, God need not be defined." To suggest that God was in any way finite or limited, like his creation, was also irra tional. To pray, because God either demanded or willed it, rather than for man's benefit, was "irrational superstitition." And finally, to conceive of a God that rewarded and punished man for his be havior was anthropomorphic and "erring." In short then, Voor sanger argued as follows: religion must be rational; Judaism's historic genius is its "rationality" (ethical monotheism); and reason was winning the struggle against paganism as the world moved toward "the growth of the brotherhood of man and the triumph of human goodness," the triumph of morality over materialism, and a time when the "pantheon of gods will bite the dust before Jahveh." Emanu El succinctly formulated this credo in announcing that it represented a "progressive, rational Judaism."10 Reform Judaism most fully grasped the mission of Israel and was responsible for most "distinctly presenting the theory of moral evo lution." This presentation of the "mission of reform" had been "adjusted, in the light of its American environment," but still re mained true to "prophetic universalism and progress." This religious rationalization of evolution carried with it the uncritical assumption of the corollary belief in progress. This was at work in the religious and moral realms as well as in nature. Progress was real and evo lution provided cosmic sanction for trust in the ultimate triumph of good. And since the human mind was "eternally progressing upon the pathway of truth," American Judaism's mission was to "finish the story of perfection."11 Of this progress Voorsanger never seemed to have had any doubt. The accommodation of liberal religion to the leading scientific philoso phy of the nineteenth century, the theory of evolution, emphasized the ethical aspects of Judaism and linked moral and religious im provement to the current optimistic belief in progress.

Mankind hates less, persecutes less, enslaves less, kills less today than it did in former times. Men are closer to each other, more helpful, tolerant than they have ever been before." In such optimistic odes Krauskopf and Voorsanger were joined not only by their own rabbinical colleagues but Protestant clergymen as well. The mood of the times produced a climate of "manifest destiny" which implied for most Americans that the United States would not only solve its most pressing social problems but dominate the future destinies of mankind as well. Reflecting the dominant pollyanna mood of his America in his religious version of evolution, Voorsanger extolled contemporary progress: "I am witnessing the triumphant vindication of man's moral destiny."12 This concept of Judaism, viewed by Voorsanger as the principal legacy of the nineteenth to the twentieth century, was articulated with considerable concern for Gentile approval. Voorsanger hoped that a large number of Christians would be attracted to the syna gogue by the "Ideal of a pure religion," that the Gentile world would applaud a Judaism "neither secular nor partisan," and that a "universal ritual" would be so broad that the Gentile could "join in adoration of the same God." The goal of such a concept of Juda ism would be that the non-Jew "look on the Jew as a creature after his own image and likeness."13 ... today we accept as binding only the moral laws and maintain only such ceremonies as elevate and sanctify our lives, but reject all such as are not adapted to the views and habits of modern civilization.

(Pittsburgh Platform) The mass migration of East European Jews to America provided a particularly strong influence upon the thought of Voorsanger. Their religious Orthodoxy, or at least what he imagined to be their religion, continually agitated him, while their tendency to congregate in large numbers of eastern cities proved equally alarming. Addi tionally, Voorsanger's grasp of other contemporary issues, especially Zionism, was to be affected by their relationship to Jewish Ortho doxy.14 Voorsanger interchanged four terms in describing the Judaism of the immigrants: Orientalism, Talmudism, Rabbinism, and Kabbal ism. Rejecting the messianic "Return to Zion," whether in its reli gious or political form, as a "reductio ad absurdum scheme," and viewing the American existence of the Jews as the "most highly de veloped state of Judaism," Voorsanger looked upon himself as an "American Israelite." His religious expression was attuned to that of the West while traditional Judaism was a heritage from the East. It was filled with what he continually labelled "Orientalisms."15 One such Orientalism was Yiddish, the mother tongue of the im migrants. It was a "jargon" which "created a spirit of antagonism to American institutions." When Voorsanger noted that the London Jewish World wrote approvingly of the "revival in Yiddish" as a "literary tongue," he was angered. There is, he argued, "no greater drawback to the progress of the Jew in England and America than the clinging to the almost unintelligible German tongue."16 Orthodox "minute, soulless practises of ritual" were not only from the East but "meaningless, Oriental rites." These "dead branches on our tree of life" chain Jews to the ghetto, prevent the mind from exploring the influences of modern civilization, and make "Americans 14 JP, May 18, 1894, p. 4.

Such rituals of the "orientals and semi-orientals" were designated as "senseless" by Voorsanger be cause of their irrationality. Reason, he argued, must be paramount, not only as a synonym for revelation but as a yardstick for measur ing the validity of ritual. "Irrational, senseless orientalisms" in cluded such Orthodox rituals as tieing the strings of a shroud, throwing three spadefuls of earth upon the interred remains, cover ing the heads of worshippers, kissing the mantlet of the Torah scroll, and believing that God annually reviewed one's behavior on Yom Kippur.17 Rabbinism and Talmudism were usually reserved by Voorsanger to depict those that defended Orientalisms, especially Orthodox rab bis and teachers. Their most serious fault was the opposition they demonstrated to "modern progress," to "critical investigation" and to the "spirit of the times." They insisted on "laying [their] Tephil lim and kissing [their] door-posts" while claiming that "progress" â€” the favorite word of clergymen at the turn of the century â€” was a delusion. Thus those Orthodox leaders represented "retrogressive forces," and one of their number, "a doddering idiot, of course," even had the audacity to exhort his people not to send their children to the public schools.18 The "spirit of the times," for Voorsanger, clearly called for assimi lation, and Reform Judaism was the "instrument of assimilation." Orthodox rabbis were "inimical" to such a spirit, therefore their "religion, their philosophy and their interpretations of questions of life are not ours." These same leaders "attempt to arrest the vic torious march of progress" towards the assimilation of the Jew to his "dear native land." It is rabbinism, as well, whose pertinacity kept the Jews separate and secluded "when the time for segregation had long passed." This only occassioned hostility against Jews, as the "barriers between Jew and Gentile [were erected] as high as Babel's tower." Rabbinism kept the Jew in "darkness and seclu sion," refusing to actualize prophetic universalism and "tear out the title page between the Old and New Testament."19 Kabbalism, although properly the subject of Jewish mysticism, was reserved by Voorsanger for his most hostile thoughts on the religion and the religious leaders of the East European Jews. Kab balism was the "garbage of science," the distillation of "all the 17 "Historical Revolts Against Legalism," EE, November 25, 1898, p. 8; "Progress of Jews and Judaism in the Nineteenth Century," EE, January 27, 1899, p. 8; EE, Septem ber 9, 1904, p. 9, January 13, 1899, p. 9. 18 EE, June 10, 1904, p. 5, June 17, 1904, pp. 5-6, May 29, 1896, pp. 6-7. 18 EE, June 17, 1904, p. 6, February 18, 1898, pp. 6-7, January 27, 1899, p. 9.</page><page sequence="10">194 AMERICAN JEWISH HISTORICAL QUARTERLY aberrations that disfigure our literary and intellectual history." It included Jews that mumbled their devotions, concerned themselves with clean pots and pans, failed to take their heads out of their Talmuds, sought out "ghetti" for their residences, and insisted upon "rigid, unbending, intolerant legalism." Kabbalism represented the "embodiment of a dead tradition" or "excrescences," and thus "modern Jews" had "experienced a revulsion of feeling toward it." Such excrescences were medieval, retrogressive and non-productive; "true Judaism," on the other hand, was a Judaism "cleansed from the foreign coating that mysticism, isolation and the infusion of geographical ideas gave it." It was, in sum, freedom from a "galling yoke."20 In order to escape the yoke of Kabbalism, the East European Jewish immigrants would have to be moved out of their "reeking pestholes â€” the ghetti." The specific terms Voorsanger used for this program were distribution and colonization, but the removal of the immigrants from the crowded centers of Orientalism was part of a larger program called by Voorsanger "Occidentalization." A Judaism for American Jews would have to be occidentalized â€” cleansed of its oriental features. Voorsanger continually urged such a program of cleansing. The nineteenth century, which witnessed the emergence of Re form Judaism, gave birth to the occidentalization of the Jew. Re form Judaism, which was nothing less than a revolution against orientalism, restored to the Jew his "birthright" and "an honorable place beside his fellow citizens." It took him out of the ghetto, opened his mind to the influences of modern civilization and the language of his neighbors, and broke through the "trammels of legalism."21 American Judaism provided the fulfillment of the revolution against "rigid, irreconcilable, retrogressive Ghetto Juda ism." It succeeded, in part, by demanding "full capitulation;" for there were, Voorsanger made clear, "but two issues in American Judaism, orientalism or occidentalism, Reform or Orthodoxy, mod ern Judaism or Rabbinism."22 By the end of the nineteenth century an occidentalized American Jewish community was "confronted by an invasion from the East" which threatened to "undo the work of two generations of American 20 EE, April 15,1904, p. 6, January 21,1898, p. 7, October 28,1904, p. 6; "Evolutionary Tendencies in Religion: Jewish Women of the Eighteenth Century," EE, December 2, 1898, p. 7. 21 "Progress of Jews and Judaism in the Nineteenth Century," EE, January 27, 1899, pp. 7-8. 22 EE, March 3, 1899, p. 5, January 13, 1899, pp. 6-7.</page><page sequence="11">RABBI JACOB VOORSANGER ON JEWS AND JUDAISM 195 Jews." In the third issue of Emanu-El Voorsanger sounded the alarm by noting that he had warned the Occidental Lodge of B'nai B'rith: "A wave of Orientalism has struck the country." The 250,000 Jews in America of 1880 were joined by more than one mil lion Jews during the next two decades. 700,000, Voorsanger claimed, had settled in New York City, 60,000 in Philadelphia and 60,000 in Chicago. These Jewish immigrants "herd together and refuse to scatter," and will soon create "not merely a New York Ghetto, but a Chicago Ghetto, a Boston Ghetto, a Ghetto in every city in the Union, including San Francisco." This posed a threat to both "occidental spirit and culture" by opposing assimilation as well as by hostility to the "instrument" of assimilation: Reform Juda ism.23 One effective cure for this opposition would be the distribution and colonization of Jewish immigrants throughout America, away from the "narrow world" and "isolation" of the Orthodox ghettos. Plans for this program were made even before mass migration began in the 1880s, and the reasons for this effort were varied. The Ameri can Jewish leadership sought to disprove the stereotype of the Jew as a Shylock, petty trader and middle-man by preventing Jews, overwhelmingly engaged in petty commerce in Eastern Europe, from resorting to peddling in America. These leaders also hoped to alleviate the ill effects of congestion in the cities, where Yiddish speaking, bearded, gesticulating tenement dwellers were a source of embarrassment and potential anti-Semitism to their Americanized co-religionists. This colonization program would not only clean out the cities, but destroy an old myth: "It has been said that Jews can not be farmers," scoffed one Jewish leader, "as if a Jew were other than a man! No more adaptable individual than the Jews â€” no race more readily affected by environment than the Jewish." Here was a chance to return, as Voorsanger observed, to the "agricultural life of remote ancestors" and the Jew's "honorable past;" each would be free to sit under his "own 'vine and fig tree.'

"Hundreds of millions of acres," Voorsanger wrote, "between the Rocky Mountains and the lakes" await the migration of the immigrants. Such a movement would speed the "processes of occidentalization" and develop the "assimilating proc esses of American life," for the "salvation of our people lies in their being Americanized in the shortest possible time."26 Voorsanger was confident that the East European Jews would "rapidly become subject to the processes of assimilation." To those who doubted their ability to endure on farms in Kansas, Montana and Oregon, Voorsanger replied that it was merely a matter of ex perience; Russian and Rumanian Jews were "not yet fully tested" in "pioneer work." They would learn if they were "left to [their] own resources" â€” without, that is, food and clothing â€” for an "as sisted colonist is invariably a failure." Left on their own, "unsup ported and unsubsidized," they would quickly occidentalize. Even more: if successful, "even characteristics of feature and other ethno logical peculiarities will melt away under the influence of air and soil."27 Despite Voorsanger's optimism, the distribution efforts faced many serious difficulties. The East European Jews themselves pro vided an important source of opposition; "many efforts are being made to distribute Jews throughout the United States," Voorsanger noted, "which efforts, it seems, are being resisted as much as possible by those Orthodox Jews who believe that distribution means assimi lation." There was also the reluctance of established communities in the interior to encourage the settlement of additional refugees in their midst. But even when the immigrants could be motivated to remove themselves from the city and western leaders were willing, most attempts were unsuccessful.

"Los Angeles is just now crowded with Jewish immigrants [1905!]," asserted an editorial in the B'nai B'rith Messenger; "in response to our advice to its leaders they had no cause to settle in Southern California."28 In 1891 the International Society for the Colonization of Russian Jews was organized in San Francisco and Jacob Voorsanger was one of its directors. The editor of the American Hebrew, an Anglo-Jewish newspaper in New York City, argued that it was senseless to ship the immigrants 3,000 miles away from New York against their will; Voorsanger replied that "the further they travel, the less friction they are likely to produce in their contact with established usage and a concrete civilization." The one attempt by the Society to found a colony in the Sacramento Valley proved unsuccessful, and Voorsanger subsequently tried to prevent distribution and coloniza tion efforts around the San Francisco area.29 Fears of East European Orthodoxy, the Shylock image, "visi bility," as well as the hope of a rapid assimilation and Americaniza tion, were major influences in shaping Voorsanger's attitude towards distribution and colonization. But the compelling reasons were more subtle still. They revealed not so much the needs of the new arrivals as those of the spokesmen for these plans. Voorsanger urged not only that concentration of the immigrants should be ut terly discouraged but "they should be made to understand that their distribution over the full length and width of the country would be salutary for themselves and less provocative of social and economic problems to their co-religionists." When Voorsanger spoke of the "settlements of Russian Jews scattered throughout the wide Northwest solving the Jewish 'question,' " he usually meant the possibility of the non-Jewish population failing to distinguish the assimilated American "Israelites" from the "Yiddish-mumblers."

And not every San Franciscan non-Jew would separate, as the Brahmins curiously did, their Americanized Jewish friends from the "morally degenerate" East Europeans. Oc cidentalization, distribution and colonization were the most viable solutions to this dilemma.30 This conviction that the East European Jew could be assimilated more rapidly and completely in a rural setting appears foolish even in theory. As the experience of German agricultural colonies had already made clear, assimilation slowed or halted in rural environ ments where there existed only limited contacts with outside agencies and individuals. In sparsely populated areas, an ethnic community is forced to rely more upon itself and maintains its isolation. Country life, observed Robert E. Park in 1921, "emphasizes local differences, preserves the memories of the immigrants, and fosters a sentimental interest in the local home community." Nevertheless, the agrarian myth was a useful tool in the hands of Voorsanger. It really mattered little that the Jewish immigrants were totally unprepared "to make the desert to bloom as a garden so that two blades of grass be made to grow where but one has grown before."31 Another solution to mass Jewish immigration was the cessation of migration, a position Voorsanger supported for several years. He was, of course, not alone in favoring an end to the mass immigration of Rumanian, Galician and Russian Jews, although "limiting" the numbers was a more common proposal in the Jewish communities of Western Europe and America than complete cessation. Pleas for limiting the immigrant numbers were heard within the Jewish com 30 See, for the economic argument and Shylock image, Oscar Handlin, "How United States Anti-Semitism Began," Commentary 11 (1951), 541-48; EE, December 4, 1903, p. 7, November 22, 1906, p. 7; AH, March 19, 1886, pp. 81-82, and Voorsanger's com munication to AH, June 5, 1891, p. 107; JM, February 3, 1893, pp. 4-5; AI, August 4, 1882, p. 56.

Therefore, "the present national agitation in favor of restricted immigration is just," and "not a single sensa tion of sympathy nor any sentiment of affection generated by kin ship or religious affiliation should prevent us from appreciating the justice of this ultimate procedure."33 Such a two-pronged attack on orientalism, Voorsanger confidently predicted, would bring "ultimate homogeneity" and the unification of the Jews into "one great nationality" of English speaking, public school attending Jews. A "million homogeneous American Jews" would leave the "seething and sickening centers of Slavic Jewish immigration" behind and "adapt and assimilate." They would all then sing, with one heart, "God bless the flag with its increasing and refulgent stars, now and forever."34 We consider ourselves no longer a nation but a religious community, and therefore expect neither a return to Palestine, nor a sacrificial worship under the administration of the sons of Aaron, nor the res toration of any of the laws concerning the Jewish state.

Such a program was supported much more vigor ously by a number of leading Reform rabbis of Voorsanger's day: Wise and Philipson of Cincinnati, Stolz of Chicago, Kohler of New York, and Krauskopf of Philadelphia. Joseph Krauskopf, rabbi of Kenesset Israel from 1887 to 1923 and the author of more than 500 published sermons, demanded both immigrant restriction and distribution; see especially "What to do with the Russian Refugee," December 17, 1905, "The Wail of the Modern Ghetto â€” the Diagnosis," December 23, 1900, and "The Wail of the Modern Ghetto, II.</page><page sequence="16">200 AMERICAN JEWISH HISTORICAL QUARTERLY Zionism and Zionist activities were "Oriental aberrations" in Voorsanger's mind. His philosophy, reflecting the position of Re form Judaism as framed in its Pittsburgh Platform, tended toward a broad universalism; it saw in Judaism a prophetic call to mankind toward a higher moral order. For Voorsanger, the Jewish people was a "spiritual concept rather than a physical reality." Israel's mission, he wrote in 1898, "is a spiritual one; its political aspirations are dead forever." The Jew was the bearer of a mission, and to exer cise this mission to greatest advantage his dispersion among the Gentiles was a conditio sine qua non. Nationalism, especially in the form of Zionism, was for him a double contradiction: it violated the spirit of the universal mission of the Jew which could only be achieved in the Diaspora (read: America), and it concretized a spiritual idea into political reality â€” a far cry from the suprana tional prophetic urgings of the Bible.35 Isaac Mayer Wise (1819-1900), Voorsanger's close friend and col league, had developed this position quite clearly in the decade prior to the emergence of Herzl into world prominence. The charge, that in America Zionism was a creation of and supported only by "recent immigrants" from Eastern Europe, appeared in Wise's writings as early as 1885. Wise continued to denounce this "Russian-Polish hobby," primarily as a threat to the American allegiance of the German Jews, for the remainder of his life. These Zionists turned the "mission of Israel" away from its "universal and sanctified ground" to the "narrow and political." They are "phantastic dupes of a thoughtless utopia" and their movement was particularly upset ting to Americanized Jews striving to convince their fellow Americans of their loyalty and patriotism, for it "confirms the assertion of our enemies that the Jews are foreigners in the countries in which they are at home."36 A Remedy," January 6, 1901, in Joseph Krauskopf, Papers, 1887-1906, American Jewish Archives. 36 "The Sources of Judaism: The Struggle of Judaism Against Heathendom," EE, February 25, 1898, p. 7; EE, July 17, 1896, p. 5; W.

Its nationalistic implications were a reflection upon American citizen ship, and a Jew must have no attachment which would in a "special way distinguish [him] from his neighbors."37 Zionism, Voorsanger argued, demanded that the Jews of America deny that "America is our Jerusalem." While he attacked the move ment as "false, mischievous and dangerous" as well as hypocritical, insincere and irrational ("it is not merely folly; it is a crime"), he reserved his most scathing indictment for its challenge to the Ameri canization of the Jew. Americanization obviously excluded national ism and a "separate political future for the Jews." Yet Zionism called for a political loyalty "above the starry folds of our venerated flag" and a "fanaticism that would immediately deny the claims of nation and flag." It maintains the "impossible doctrine" that the Jew cannot become domesticated in countries such as America. It was this fear of a new nationalism which agitated Voorsanger, for he viewed its emergence as harmful to the American Jews. It would immediately raise the question of "double loyalty" or "intertwined sentiment" â€” something which Americans could not understand. Hence it was a "dangerous doctrine," for it assumed the incapacity of Jews to "assimilate with their Gentile neighbors."38 Zionism was also the "most extravagant perversion of the old prophetic ideals." It stated, as Voorsanger understood it, that the Jew had no home, and "American Jews deny this;" it announced that "the Jew hath no business amongst Aryans" and American Jews did not believe it; it denied the "wisdom that Sinai and Zion are to radiate throughout all the avenues which civilized man fol lows" and thus prevented Jews from becoming "homogeneous ele ments of all other nations." Voorsanger anticipated a new world of justice and freedom in which Jews would enjoy equal rights and privileges with all other citizens wherever they lived; Zionism de clared that Jews would be strangers everywhere until they could 37 "The National and Universal Ideals of Israel," EE, December 16, 1898, p. 7; EE, June 9, 1905, p. 13, March 31, 1905, p. 5; Jacob Voorsanger, op. cit., pp. 15-18. 38 "The National and Universal Ideals of Israel," EE, December 16, 1898, p. 8; EE, July 8, 1904, p. 5, June 23, 1905, p. 5, September 13, 1907, p. 2, February 28, 1908, p. 1; "Where Do We Stand?"

Zionism repudiated "the prophetic ideals" of spreading the "Tora [to] millions, tens of millions of fol lowers, who are not Jews," for the prophetic summons to Israel was a "message of salvation" to all the world. To return to the "tribal conditions of 5,000 years ago" was to admit that Israel "are strangers and sojourners before God and man." To assure his non-Jewish friends that this was merely "a dream," he told an Independence Day gathering in 1904 that "the Jews of America... are not in sympathy with Zionism. Even the rank and file of the various Zionist societies ... have no patience with the Zionist platform."39 Voorsanger's conception of Jewish history, no less than his under standing of Reform Judaism, supported his anti-Zionist position. The history of Ancient Israel and of the Second Commonwealth, although acted out in Palestine, was essentially concerned with monotheism and not political policy. The Jews of antiquity were busy with "prophetical policy" and developing, maintaining and preserving the "great truths that constitute the moral element in civilization"; they were "never politicians or economists." As mis sionaries and teachers of ethical monotheism Jews were "splendid," but it would be impossible to resurrect these functions if Palestine became a Jewish home. The prophetic function of the Jews would only be fulfilled in Western Europe, Russia, and America.40 Despite the wave of pogroms engulfing the Russian Jews while his Open Letters on Zionism were being written, Voorsanger remained optimistic about the fate of Diaspora Jewry. In only "the first cen tury of modern life," there is no more "purer Frenchman than the French Jew" and "no better American" than thousands of American Jews. And even in Russia, where one senses "social changes" and a "progressive life" dawning, the "legitimate progression of events" will enable the bulk of Russian Jews to "work out their salvation."41 Jacob Voorsanger was skillfully able to adjust Jewish theology to the accepted scientific theories of his day and the social configuration of his America. The Americanization of Judaism demanded from 39 "Evolutionary Tendencies in Religion: Jewish Women of the Eighteenth Century," EE, December 2, 1898, p. 5; "The National and Universal Ideals of Israel," EE, Decem ber 16, 1898, p. 8; EE, July 29, 1898, p. 7, March 9, 1906, p. 8, EE, July 15, 1904, p. 5.

He negated Jewish na tionalism as a catalyst for Jewish life, choosing instead to understand the mission of Judaism as seeking full integration, save in religion, into American society. With reason as his vigilant companion, he continually tested the fabric of contemporary Jewish life and never lost his optimistic faith. The result was the general rejection of all which stood between Judaism and the non-Jewish world. Steering clear of all exclusiveness, couching his sermons in an all embracing universalism, and denouncing most Jewish customs and practises, Voorsanger brought the message of the Pittsburgh Platform to large numbers of San Francisco Jews for almost a quarter of a century.
