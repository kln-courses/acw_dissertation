In chapters V and VI of these contributions (cf. A. J. P. X 117, II9), Prof. Rajna had treated of the influ- ence on the naming of persons in Italy due to the penetration into that country of the French romances of the Round Table. In the present article (of 66 pages, half of which are occupied by detailed illustrative annotations), he undertakes, by ferreting out in the mediaeval charters the earliest occur- rences of Christian names belonging to the Carolingian epos, to trace the introduction into Italy and subsequent diffusion there of the poems of this cycle. The author is duly on his guard against unwarranted inferences, the data being peculiarly open to question for the present purpose, in view of the earlier introduction of the same French names through military rather than literary channels, in connection with the Italian conquests of Pepiri and Charle- magne. Accordingly, the mere occurrence of names such as Carlo, Rolando (or Orlando), Buovo, Rinaldo, Uggero, signifies nothing, and it is only by taking into account special considerations-as e. g. where an Olivero has named his son Rolando, or two brothers are called respectively Olivero and Rolando-that the investigator finds his indications beginning to acquire value. Proceeding carefully on such lines, and applying the closest analysis and elimination to an elaborate series of cases, Prof. Rajna demonstrates the early and wide diffusion in Italy of a large number of the French epic poems of the national cycle, among them the Chanson de Roland, the Conquete de l'Es- pagne, Mainet, Beuve de Hanstone, Otinel, Ogier, the Chanson des Saisnes, Flovent, Floovent, Guillaume au Court Nez, Aiol, Aspremont, and the Quatre Fils Aymon. P. Meyer. Fragments du Roman de Troie. I. Fragment de Bale (with facsimile). This fragment, consisting of two double leaves, comprising 416 verses each, was presented by the librarian of the University of Bale to M. Meyer, who believes it to be a specimen of an earlier and better text than that of any other of the numerous manuscripts of the poem. In 1874 Mr. Scheler published some two hundred verses of the Roman de Troie from a stray leaf preserved in the Royal Library at Brussels; this leaf, on comparison, proves to be another fragment of the manuscript in question. M. Meyer here pub- lishes the Bale fragment with notes and emendations, and then proceeds to a tentative classification of the twenty-two MSS of the poem which he has been able to control. The method employed is to print from all the MSS, for pur- poses of comparison, a parallel passage of twenty verses selected in view of certain available divergences and difficulties. From a scrutiny of the data</page><page sequence="2">thus afforded it appears that the edition of the Roman de Troie published by A. Joly (Paris, I87o-I, 2 vols.) is founded on MSS belonging to an inferior group. The processes and results of the examination here conducted, though not presented as exhaustive or strictly rigorous, may be commended to students interested in gaining an insight into the classification of MSS and the consti- tution of texts. (On p. 71, 1. 3, the verse " Or iert veil qui n'avra pris " should read . . . qui 'n avra pris, and is in fact so printed in its proper place in the text.

There is a folk-lore tradition, extending over the most of Europe, which is based upon the frequent phenomenon of the return of cold weather in early spring, after the apparent close of winter. The popular imagination has sought to account for this occurrence by attributing it to the anger or resentment of the occult powers which preside over the seasons, and the legend turns in general upon the arrogance of a certain mythical old woman who has ventured to affront one of the months of the year-the last month of winter or the first of spring- and who thus provokes the untimely return of cold weather. In the Eastern forms of the story-among the Roumanians, Bulgarians, Servians, Greeks-a topographical element predominates: certain anthropomorphic rocks or moun- tain piles are figured as representing the imprisoned form of the offending old woman. In its Western forms-among the Provencaux, Italians, Spanish, English-it is the meteorological aspect which prevails: here the old woman is replaced sometimes by a shepherd, rarely by a bird. Among the Roumanians the season of returning cold is called the "Jours de la Vieille (Zilele Babei)." In Scotland the days in question are called Borrowing or Borrowed Days, and under this title the legend was first studied by P. Meyer in Romania III 294- 297. In the present article the subject is treated under the three heads of (I), the Roumanian legend, (2) the legends of other peoples of the Balkan penin- sula, and (3) the traditions concerning the Jours d'emprunt in the rest of Europe. In Scotland the Borrowed Days are the last three days of March, and during that time superstitious people refrain from lending or borrowing, because March borrowit fra Averill Three days, and they were ill. Melanges. I. P. Meyer. Version anglaise du poeme francais des Enfances Jesus Christ. M. Meyer discovers that the first poem published in Horst- mann's Altenglische Legenden is a fairly exact translation of the French Enfances Jesus Christ, discussed by himself in two earlier volumes of the Romania. This he establishes by confronting parallel passages.-II. A. Delboulle. Estaler, estal. These words signify sometimes in O. F. mingere, actio mingendi, but are not so defined by Godefroy. Further, estal, esta, estat signify urina. G.

G. Paris. Avoir son Olivier courant. The general meaning (" avoir la chance, la bonne passe ") of this 0. F. locution has been understood, but its origin is here first explained. By a comparison of MS variants, M. Paris shows that in this phrase Olivier is a corruption of alevin (fry, young fish), and that the saying is properly connected with fish culture: "quand l'alevin est courant, vivant et fretillant, il se porte bien, et celui qui le possede est en bonne passe. La locution ne se comprit plus, et on remplaca le mot alevin, inconnu en dehors de certains milieux, par celui d'olivier: il ne donnait aucun sens, mais il etait connu, c'est tout ce qu'il fallait." M. Paris adds: Ce n'est pas plus absurde, pour ne parler que des locutions, que d'avoir remplace l'Alcoran par 'an quarante dans: Je m'en moque comme de I'an quarante (an explanation which is also here printed for the first time).-IV.

Delle opere di Dante Alighieri (Vol. VI, ia parte della Storia della Letteratura italiana). The present part of Bartoli's monumental work treats of the composition of Dante's Divine Comedy in its more external and con- structive features. Starting from the principal allegory as contained in the opening canto, the author passes in review the Dantesque distribution of departed spirits in the future life according to their vices or virtues; dwells upon the import of the various forms of punishment, expiation and reward; discusses the demonology of the poem, and Cato's custodianship of Purgatory; and concludes with an investigation of the duration of Dante's vision. The book is dominated by a spirit very different from the blind idolatry which many students of Dante have displayed. Wahle, Die Pharsale des Nicolas von Verona (A. Thomas). Through an intimation received from Mr. Ritter, Dean of the Faculty of Letters of Geneva, Mr. Wahle made the interesting discovery of this Old French chanson de geste, numbering 117 tirades, which he has published as number LXXX of Professor Stengel's series of Ausgaben und Abhandlungen. The author, Nicolas of Verona, informs us that he produced in I343 this rimed account of the battle of Pharsalia, out of love for his seigneur, the Marquis of Ferrara. The motive for his choice of subject, as explained by himself, is characteristic. The grands seigneurs of his period, while upon their long journeys, were accus- tomed to relieve the monotony of the route by listening to stories of the olden time. But reading being inconvenient on horseback, these stories had to be committed to memory by their narrators. Now, verse being easier to memorize than prose, and no one having before versified the Pharsalia, our author feels himself called on to place this story on the same footing with the already familiar accounts of Hector, Porus and Alexander, of Charlemagne and Roland. 1 The same explanation has been given of the English ' stale,' which is used chiefly of draught animals.-B.

Novati, precede le texte diplomatique offert par ses soins au public erudit."- In a favorable notice of Vising's Die realen Tempora der Vergangenheit im Franzosischen, etc. (Franzosische Studien VI 3), the reviewer says: " L'auteur a eu surtout pour but de porter la lumiere sur la valeur reelle des divers temps du passe dans le francais moderne," in which remark there appears to lurk a misapprehension of the term realen Tempora in German.-In his notice of Modern Language Notes for I888 (incorrectly given as 1887), M. Paul Meyer remarks as follows upon the article of H. A. Todd entitled "Apropos of ' Les trois morts et les trois vifs'"': " M. Todd avait imprime le dit des trois morts et des trois vifs dans la preface de son edition de la PanthMre d'amours sans se rappeler que ce meme opuscule avait deja ete publie par M. de Montaiglon, et, plus recemment, signale dans trois mss., l'un desquels le presente sous une forme ecourtee. M. Todd rectifie et complete a cet egard sa preface d'apres une observation faite par le secretaire de la Societe des anciens textes (Bul- letin, I885, p. 96)." As a matter of fact, however, Mr. Todd's edition of Les trois morts was collated on that of M. de Montaiglon, several errors in which were corrected by comparison with the original MS.-M. Meyer suggests emendations to R. Otto's Zwei altcatalanische Rechtsformulare.-Attention is called to the establishment (in January, I889) of a new review, La Revista Catalana, under the editorship of M. l'abbe Jaume Collell. " M.

Arsene Darmesteter, lecturer at the Sorbonne and at the Ecole pratique des Hautes Etudes, and author of numerous important works in the domain of Romance philology, died suddenly in Paris, November I6, 1888, at the age of forty-two years.-In January, I889, appeared the first num- ber of the "Annales du Midi, revue archeologique, historique et philologique de la France meridionale, publiee sous les auspices du Conseil general des Facultes de Toulouse, par Antoine Thomas."

Its leading feature is a lengthy study by Gaston Paris of the " Romans en vers de la Table Ronde."-A notice from the pen of Gaston Paris is devoted to the Berlin doctor's dissertation of Philippe Marcou, of Harvard University, entitled: Der historische Infinitif im Franz6sischen. " L'auteur . . . s'est efforce d'ex- pliquer la remarquable construction francaise que La Fontaine a employee avec predilection (etgrenouilles de se plaindre, etc.), et qui, jusqu'a present, n'a pas ete suffisamment eclaircie. I1 soutient avec raison que cette construction ne provient, ni par voie populaire ni par imitation savante, de l'infinitif histo- rique du latin." M. Paris examines and rejects the theory supported by Dr. Marcou in explanation of this construction, but adds: "M. Marcou aura toujours Ie merite d'avoir appele l'attention sur un curieux probleme de syntaxe francaise, laisse jusque la dans l'ombre, et d'en avoir commence l'histoire." Avril. A. Wilmotte. Etudes de dialectologie wallonne. II. La region au Sud de Liege. A study of twenty-four pages continued from Volume XVII (cf. A. J. P. X 12I). The author accepts provisionally the dialect theory of "centres civilisateurs" propounded by Gr6ber (Grundriss I 415-I9), and recognizes two such centres in the Walloon territory, one to the north of Liege, operating toward the southeast, the other falling between Huy and Namur. The syste- matic presentation of Walloon dialect peculiarities is followed by a series of "pieces justificatives" in the form of documents pertaining to the regions under investigation. A. Pages. Recherches sur la Chronique catalane attribuee a Pierre IV d'Aragon. An article of forty-eight pages. The Chronicle here studied is the best ordered, if not the most interesting, of the Catalan productions in this style. Until recently attributed to Peter IV of Aragon, surnamed the Cere- monious, it is here shown by interesting documents to be the composition of one Bernat Dezcoll, who wrote, however, under the direction and supervision of his prince. The manuscripts of the Chronicle are three in number, and are here described, analyzed and classified. Considerable portions of the two redactions thus established are confronted, with the effect of exhibiting impor- tant amplifications in the second redaction. The article concludes with an account of the three editions published, that of Carbonell (1547), Bofarull (I850), and Coroleu (1885). Melanges. I. J. Loth. La fable de l'origine troyenne des Bretons. Georg Heeger, in his dissertation 0ber die Trojanersage der Britten, seems to have shown that the passage in the Historia of Nennius which traces to the Trojans the origin of the Britons, is an interpolation. This view is supported by the fact that, of a recently published series, dating from the tenth century, of gene- alogies of Welsh princes, not one contains a mention of Trojans as ancestors of the Britons.-II. F. Novati. L'ultima poesia di Gualtiero di Chatillon. Prof. Novati argues plausibly, from internal and external evidence, in favor of regarding a certain Latin poem of the Carmina Burana as the swan-song of Walter of Chatillon, who was perhaps the best Latin poetizer of the twelfth century.-III. G. Paris. Par ci le me taille. The explanation is given of this puzzling locution, of which a few occurrences, in the phrase Ansi corn par 242</page><page sequence="6">ci le me taille, had been noted in Old French literature. A sermon of Nicolas de Biard contains the following: "Magistri cementariorum, virgam et cyro- thecas in manibus habentes, aliis dicunt: Par ci le me taille, et nihil laborant, et tamen majorem mercedem accipiunt; quod faciunt multi moderni prelati." " On voit que c'est un dicton emprunte ai la langue des maCons et tailleurs de pierre: faire quelque chose comme [celui i qui on dit] par ci le me taille, c'est faire comme l'ouvrier qui taille bien droit sa pierre suivant la ligne que le maitre lui a tracee."-IV.

A. Thomas. Sur le sort de quelques manuscrits de la famille d'Este. Comptes-rendus. Max Friedrich Blau. Zur Alexiuslegende. Inaugural dissertation (G. Paris). Prof. Paris had advanced the theory (Rom. VIII 163) that in the oldest versions of this legend Alexis was of Constantinople, and not, as the later versions make him, of Rome. In the present dissertation Mr. Blau supports the contrary opinion with sufficient success to win over Prof. Paris provisionally to his view. The romancer who composed the legend of St. Alexis was unquestionably a Greek, and he drew most of the details of his narrative from the legend of St. Johannes Calybites of Constantinople. His motive for making Rome in this case the primary scene of the action lay, doubtless, in the necessity of avoiding too close a resemblance to his original, as well as in- his desire for freer scope in the admission of the marvellous. Later, the apocryphal personage, Saint Alexis of Rome, became fully ac- credited in the East, and it was with great surprise that Sergius, Archbishop of Damas, arriving at Rome, found there not the slightest trace or knowledge of the Roman saint whom all the Orient held in veneration. The dissertation presents interesting information of various import, and is characterized by good method and judicious reasoning. A. Wesselofsky. Materiaux et recherches pour servir a l'histoire du roman et de la nouvelle, tome II, section slavo-romane (en russe). Saint-Petersbourg, Publication de l'Academie des sciences (Th. Batiouskof). This extended review is purely analytical rather than critical. Under the title of " Recits slavo-romans," Mr. Wesselofsky comprises a group of fabulous traditions which, based upon Romance originals, were introduced into the Russian literature of the sixteenth century by means of South Slavic versions. To this current was attached later another, in which it is Poland that plays the role of intermediary between Western Europe and Russia. The stories in question were thus transplanted into an environment very different from the courts and castles in which reigned the ideas and usages of a system of chivalry incomprehensible to the uninitiated. The translators made the best they could of the situation: sometimes they invented new words to express such ideas as "courtoisie," "prouesse," "valeur"; sometimes they omitted episodes involving notions or situations too difficult of manipulation. The work consists of an Introduction (pp. 1-25); Part I. Le roman sud-slave de Troie (pp. 25-121); Part II.

Tobler, in his Vermischte Beitrage zur franzisischen Grammatik (Zeitschrift f. rom. Phil. XII 3-4), discusses the accord of the past participle with the subject and not with the object in the compound tenses of reflexive verbs. His theory of the use of etre as auxiliary of the reflexive verbs, and the agreement of the participle with the subject, is that this construction, e. g.jo me sui lavez, results from a merging of the perfect active,jo m'ai lave, with the passive construction,jo sui lavez (both of which occur in 0. F.). G. Paris offers a somewhat different explanation. He regards as the true point of departure the reflexives in which the object is only apparent or the sense is that of a neuter verb. The "passe indefini" was first formed with etre in neuter verbs : i vient, it vint, il est venuz (the result and not the action being prominent, il a venu would not well have expressed the idea). To certain neuter verbs which expressed a prolonged and inward state the reflexive pro- noun came to be added to express this shade of meaning: il se tait instead of tacet; and then il s'est teiuz, which is to il se tait as il est venuz is to il vient. Hence, by extension and assimilation, we have the use of the auxiliary etre and agreement of participle with subject, in the case of all reflexives. Chronique.

The Tartar, by his herculean stature and terrifying aspect, might easily have left the impression of a giant in the memory of the people, and the fact that there was a race of barbarian invaders, the Khazars, who were at the same time Tartars and Jews, doubtless explains the extension of the meaning "giant" to the word for Jew.

Octobre. A. Mussafia. Osservazioni sulla fonologia francese: La formola tj fra vocali. A highly important article, solving in a masterly manner a much-dis- cussed problem in Old French phonology. The formula tj (,=Latin unac- cented i in hiatus) in pre-tonic position always gives if (f=sonant s): ratjone, raison. In post-tonic position, two products have generally been admitted: (I) before another vowel than a, or (since any such other vowel disappears) at the end of a word, the product is likewise if; (2) before a the product is 1 (=ts), which later becomes surd s and is written either traditionally v or phonetically ss. The occurrences heretofore ranged under this second head are the words presenting the Latin suffix -itia in 246</page><page sequence="10">REPOR TS. the form -ece (-esce, -esse), and the three additional words place, mace, piece. The author undertakes to show that such a supposed difference of treatment between (r) and (2), depending on the nature of the vowel that follows, has no existence, and that the constant representative of the formula is if. Old French has four modes of reproducing what is apparently the Latin suffix -itia, viz. -else (richeise), -ece (richece), -ise (franchise), and -ice (justice). Mus- safia concludes that (I) -eise, the rarest form, is the only normal representative of -itia; (2) -ise is a popular form coming probably from -ilia, a variant of -tia; (3) -ece is a popular form answering to icia; (4) -ice is a learned form for itia. The words place, mace, piece are treated apart. G. Paris, in a "note additionelle," accepts in the main Mussafia's conclusions, but prefers to regard both -ise and -ice as learned representatives of -itia, the latter of the two being a variant of the former.

JAHRBOCHER FUR PHILOLOGIE UND PAEDAGOGIK, I890. Fascicle I. I. Das Scythenland nach Herodotos. C. Krauth, Beichlingen. An essay of 25 pp. delivered by the author in Halle, Feb. I889. The nature of the country of the Scythians is first discussed, (a) as to its boundaries, (b) its physical geography, (c) its streams, (d) climate, (e) flora, (f) fauna. The Scythians themselves are then considered, and lastly, the influence of terri- torial conditions on the people is taken up. 2. Zu Platons Politeia. O. Apelt, Weimar. A critical note on 743 c, d, Bk. V, proposing to read 7rotrttcai for -ro2aiL before fviaJel. 3. Zu Euripides Herakleidai. A critical note on I. 23I by C. Haberlin, Halle, proposing rar2)' iarT KpEiaCGo for rair' eiCt Kpeicau. 4. Zur Ilias. A short note by F. Vollbrecht, Hannover, on II 257-267. The a?prKFe eiv6onot in this passage are the wasps so common to-day; the author concludes, therefore, that Homer's entire simile, likening the Trojans springing upon the Greeks to so many wasps, is entirely natural, well-chosen, and therefore not to be rejected as spurious. 5. Zur Odyssee. Three critical notes by E. Schulze (Homburg vor der Hihe), on [I 252, reading e;va2iotot for roigS f5iyotat; on X 186, reading 6(7v r6re for 6l rTOTr; on o 231, reading 7rviyog aE[;ov for trevOoS i[e:ov. The second emendation especially is worthy of consideration. 6. Achradina, eine topographisch-historische studie. B. Lupus, Strassburg. This article, covering 17 pp., is prompted as a reply to an article upon the same subject by Haverfield in The Classical Review (III, I889, pp. IO-II2), " Two Notes on Syracuse." H. states that " the chief writers who use the name Achradina are Diodorus, Livy, and Cicero, and in no passage is its meaning accurately defined, but in no passage is it described as an elevation of any sort. I conclude, then, that Diodorus meant by Achradina the flat ground outside of Ortygia and S. of Epipolae." Lupus holds that Diodorus included the higher region to the north, and that the u a7 r62ty of Thucydides did not alone lie in the lower plain, but also extended over the high- and low-lying plains on both sides of the Lautumiae to the east. 7. Baubo and Demeter. A. Ludwich, Kbnigsberg. This is supplementary to Lobeck and E. Abel, on the fragments of Orpheus. L. sees in the notice of Baubo and Demeter by Arnobius, Adv. Nat.

Zum sechsten und achten Buche der Aeneis. Die unterwelt und der schild des Aeneas, by E. Brandes. A comparison of these books with corres- ponding passages in Homer. B.'s conclusions are that Vergil, in the first part of the sixth book, has to a considerable extent imitated portions of the eleventh book of the Odyssey, although he has tried to conceal it in every pos- sible way. Vergil has introduced an ethical element. His chief object is not to extol Rome but to magnify Augustus and his family. The eighth book con- 248</page><page sequence="12">REPORTS. tains a number of passages related to the eighteenth book of the Iliad, especially what refers to the Cyclops and Hephaistos. In the description of the shield Vergil seems to have followed Homer in the grouping and order of the pictures, although the scenes depicted are different. The shield in Vergil, in spite of many defects, excels Homer's in that the former has a unity of idea running through all the pictures, which is fully developed in the greatness of Augustus. Io. Zu Terentius, by H. Kriege. In the prologue to Hautontimorumenos, vv. 6 to Io should be rejected as interpolations. The order of the verses of the prologue should be 1-3, II-34, 4, 5, 35-52. v. 708 nam-mihi as a senarian verse is not in harmony with the septenarian verses preceding and following. The verse should be read nam-mihi&lt;istoc consilio&gt;? Eunuchus, v. 307, emend for the sake of metre as follows: te ostende sis, qui vir sies. v. 506, instead of hominis read 0 mi Antipho, mi. Fascicle 2. ii. Zur geschichte und composition der Ilias; VIII das wiedereingreifen des Achilleus in den kampf. K. Brandt, Friedeberg. This is a continuation of a similar article by Brandt in the Jhbr. 1889, pp. 233-246. It is a discus- sion of how the renewed participation of Achilles in the fight was presented in the old itrvti in its earliest and subsequent forms. The article covers some 24 pages, and is a calm and judicial treatment. 12. Die katastrophe in Sophokles Antigone. F. Seiler, Eisenberg. This is a defence of the technic of the poet, opposing L. Bellermann, in his rtick- blick, Antigone, 4th ed., I885. Seiler's conclusions are four-fold: (a) the catastrophe does not depend upon Kreon's arriving too late at the tomb of Antigone, but was unavoidable at the point of the appearance of Teiresias on the stage; (b) in 11. 998-1032 Teiresias merely urges the burial of Polyneikes' body in order that the omens may again be favorable; (c) that the king goes to Polyneikes before releasing Antigone is to be explained objectively, as required by the necessities of the poem; (d) the dearth of dramatic motive at this point is of no consequence, since Kreon's choice of action was of no importance so far as the outcome was concerned. I3. Beitrage zur kritik der briefe Ciceros an M. Brutus und zur geschichte des Mutinensischen Krieges, by 0. E. Schmidt. In the first part of the article S. endeavors to reconstruct the letters of Cicero to Brutus according to the archetype. The second part discusses Cicero's policy in the war. 14. Zu Plautus, by J. Lange. In Aulularia, v. I6I Num non should imme- diately precede v. I70, Die mihi. In Rudens, v. 338, verum omnis, read et colere instead of conferre. In Bacchides, v. 879 f., Salus should end v. 879 and be repeated at the beginning of line 880. In Rudens,v. 237, Ampelisca should be repeated.

Against a statement of Miillenhoff (Deutsche Altertumskunde, I 473 ff.). The locality where amber was discovered is not, as M. believes, to be sought on the west coast of the peninsula of Jutland, but on the coast of the East Prussian sea, whence amber was brought by ship by way of Abalus (Falster) and Baunonia (Bornholm) to Holstein and thence to Massilia, or by land to the mouth of the Po.

An exceedingly large number of textual emendations. 22. Das Dubliner Demosthenesrelief. K. Wernicke, Halle. This relief is a grossly misconceived copy of an antique relief still to be found in Verona. 23. Zu Cassius Dion. Th. Hultzsch, Torgau. This article calls our atten- tion to a passage of Zonaras, and shows that neither this historian nor Tzetzes nor the post-Constantine excerptors had any acquaintance with the uncor- rupted text of Cassius Dion. 24. Zu Horatius Oden, by N. Fritsch. I I, 3-6. F. takes for granted that curriculo means the chariot. The word, however, may designate the race-course, the race itself, or the chariot. F.'s interpretation of pulverem Olympicum collegisse is sich mit Olyzmpischem staube bedeckt zu haben, analogous to gratiam, odium or dignitatem colligere. This interpretation, "to have become dusty," is not a new one and has but little to commend it. I 7, 8 f.,plurimus refers to the poet, and is subject of dicet, as already suggested by Oudendorp. II I8, 36-40, Vocatus atque non vocatus are to be explained by voce rogatus atque non vocatus, sed mente h. e. tacite rogatus. That is, it makes no difference, as far as the god is concerned, whether the prayer is audible or not. F. knows of but one change proposed in the text, namely, audit into audet by Duntzer. Withofius, however, suggested non moratus instead of non vocatus, and this found con- siderable favor. The best interpretation is that which lies on the surface. Levare depends both upon the participles and upon audit, a not infrequent use of the infinitive in Horace. III 24, 4. A defence of the reading Tyrrhenumz- Apulicum. III 24, 5-8.

Twenty-five pages of discussion devoted to book 19, intended to detect and remove the interpolated passages. S. would exclude from this book 3-52, 75-82, 84-88, 95, I30-33, I37-I6I, 243, 250-I, 273-86, 288-92, 298-9, 3II-49, 357-85, 394- 466, 473-5, 485, 487-502, 518-34, 560-88, 594-99, 60r-2, besides emending a few other genuine lines. 27. Zur frage nach der gliederung des Platonischen dialogs Gorgias. Ch. Cron, Augsburg. This article covers 30 pages, but is largely supplemen- tary to Cron's work in the 4th ed. of Deuschle's Gorgias. It is a reply to Schirlitz, Progr. des Gymn. zu Neustettin, 1888, and Apelt's favorable notice of the same. Can the Gorgias be viewed as a philosophical work with no conclusion? That would be doing Plato a wrong. If we rightly find this conclusion in Cap. 83, then we may determine that the preceding didactic poem or story is entitled to a more independent position in the structure of the dialogue than is usually ascribed to it. 28. Philon und Ambrosius. M. Ihm, Rom. This shows, by the aid of the parallel column, the extent to which Ambrosius was indebted to the 7repi ?vyd&amp;ov of Philon in writing his treatise defuga saeculi. 29.

Some of the conclusions are: (i) Diodorus closely followed Poseidonios from the time of the Gracchi to the dictatorship of Sulla; (2) Appian and Plutarch both used, at times agreeing verbally, the same Greek source; (3) both Appian and Plutarch made use of Livy; (4) Livy drew from Poseidonios for events outside of Italy. He also made use of the memoirs of Sulla, Rutilius Rufus, Claudius Quadrigarius and Valerius Antias. REPOR TS. 251</page><page sequence="15">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. 35.

JOURNAL ASIATIQUE, I890-9I.1 Vol. XV. Pp. II3-I63. M. E. Senart continues his notes on Indian Epigraphy (see A. J. P. X 488), and a propos of certain Indo-Bactrian monuments, speaks of the influence of Greek art upon Indian art since the time of Alexander the Great and his successors. He shows that most of the remains of that ancient art in which we can trace Greek influence belong to the first century before our era, the time when India was ruled over by Parthian dynasties, especially the Pahlavi kings, who reigned between the time of the Greek invaders and the Scythians, and whose names are recorded as Gondophares, Vonones, Maues and Abdagases. These remains, however, show at the same time traces of an Iranian influence, and even of the custom of fire-worship. In this Indo-Grecian 1 See A. J. P. XI 257. 252</page><page sequence="16">REPORTS. art the Greek element appears, not in its native purity, but under the form which it took when passing through the Persian period of the Parthians. It is no longer Greek art, but the art of the Philhellenic kings. The statues studied by Prof. Senart are also very important for our knowledge of historical anatomy in the first century B. C. Three Indo-Bactrian inscriptions are examined in connection with the remarks on Buddhist art. Pp. I64-I79. In an article on J. Barth's Nominalbildung, Vol. I, M. Mayer Lambert gives his views on the vocalization of the Semitic verb and the origin of the noun. Against Barth and Paul de Lagarde, he holds that the Semitic verb is derived from the noun. Barth and all the other Semitic grammarians have not yet recognized this important fact, and therefore he can triumphantly announce that M. Barth's book 'nous apparait comme un corps sans ame. L'ame etait cependant plus facile i trouver que le corps.' But M. Lambert has by no means found this life-giving soul, as any careful and observant reader of his notes will see. His article is answered by M. J. Barth in Vol. XVI 355-360. Pp. 180o-85. M. E. Specht contributes a note on a passage in the Pien-i-tien, showing that the embassy sent by the king of the Yeu'-tchi to India took place in the year 2 B. C. under the direction of I-tsun-Keou, whose name is the Chinese transcription of Hushka. Pp. 186-193. M. P. Sabbathier prints index and additions to his study on the Agnishtoma according to the (rauta-sitra of Acvalayana (see A. J. P. XI 257). Pp. 194-230. M. J. Darmesteter has an article on the great inscription of Qandahar in Afghanistan. The records discussed by D. in this and previous articles (e. g. JA. XI 491; A. J. P. X 488) belong for the greater part to the period of the Emperor Baber and other Mongolian princes. They are of import- ance for the light which they throw upon the history of Qandahar from Baber to Akbar (1522-I598 A. D.). Pp. 269-429 contain a lengthy article by M. G. Maspero on the political career of two high functionaries in Lower Egypt, living toward the end of the third dynasty (about 4500 B. C.). Pp. 429-476. M. C. de Harlez sends a contribution on San-li-t'u, or the description of three ritual books among the Chinese before the Christian era. Vol. XVI. Pp. I9-I80. After a break of two years, M. James Darmesteter reviews again the progress of Oriental learning in France in an annual report read before the Societe Asiatique. He first mourns the losses sustained by French Oriental- ism during the the two years, the names most familiar being those of M. Hau- vette-Besnault and his famous pupil M. Abel Bergaigne, M. Gustave Garrez and M.G. Guieyesse, the Sanskrit scholars; M. Pavet de Courteille, the Turkish, and M. Arthur Amiaud, the Assyrian scholar. Among its honorary members the Society has lost M. P. de Jong and M. Michel Amari. He then proceeds to summarize, with equal sympathy and brilliancy, the results of the works published by Frenchmen-whether in separate volumes or in numerous articles, 253</page><page sequence="17">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. reviews, notes, etc.-in the eight following departments of Oriental learning: (I) India and Indo-China; (2) Persia and Afghanistan; (3) Phenicia, Judaea and Syria; (4) Arabia and the Mussulman world, including Morocco and even the Sudan; (5) Assyria; (6) Egypt; (7) Turkey, and (8) China, Annam and Japan. Pp. 203-297. M. Rene Basset publishes a collection of II7 satirical sayings and proverbs on the cities and tribes of Algeria, attributed to Sidi Ah'med ben Jousof, who lived in the fifteenth century of our era. This sort of literature is very popular among the Semitic nations. It consists in changing the name of a person, city or country, or dividing it into several parts and rearranging them in such a manner that the new word will either contain praise or blame of the person, etc. Alliteration and homophony play an important part in these short satirical remarks and puns, of which the Bible offers the earliest specimens in the blessings of Jacob and of Moses, ' ou perce l'intention de recueillir les dictons satiriques ou laudatifs qui avaient cours sur chaque tribu' (Renan, Histoire generale des langues Semitiques, 1863, I22). Pp. 298-354, 402-462, and Vol. XVII 87-I33. M. Joseph Halevy trans- literates and translates the famous correspondence of Amenophis III and Amenophis IV, kings of Egypt in the fifteenth century B. C., with Burnaburias, the Kossean king of Babylonia, Assuruballit, king of Assyria, Dusratta, king of Mitanni, and others, discovered at Tell-el-Amarna in Egypt in the year 1887. Halevy follows the text published by Abel and Winckler under the auspices of the Berlin Museum of Antiquities. He says 'les ideogrammes sont conserves sans etre remplaces par les termes qu'ils figuraient.' But if so, these ideograms should at least have been sufficiently indicated by'different type, e. g. capital letters; as they are now, they are liable to confuse the ordi- nary reader. The Assyrian values for these ideograms should also have been added in brackets, so that the student may see at a glance how M. Halevy would read the Assyrian words for the ideograms. The correspondence is of the greatest importance both for the history of Egypt and Mesopotamia in the fifteenth century B. C., and also for the study of the Assyrian language. Being written to and by foreigners, a great many syllables, consisting of two consonants + vowel, e. g. sul, dan, nis, har, tas, etc., are written su-ul, da-an, ni-is, ta-as, etc., yielding thereby a great deal of material for grammar and lexicography, and fixing some hitherto doubtful readings. In the beginning M. Halevy added some valuable philological notes, but in the second and the third article none are to be found. Pp. 379-401 contain a posthumous article, by M. G. Guieyesse, consisting in a descriptive list of articles on Sanskrit inscriptions published respectively in the Asiatic Researches, the Transactions of the Literary Society of Madras, Part I, London, 1827, the Journal of the Archaeological Society of Dehli, Jan. 1853, and the Transactions of the Archaeological Society of Agra, July- Dec. 1875. Pp. 463-510. M. E. Chavannes makes his readers acquainted with the origin and history, the arrangement and intricacies of the Calendar of the Yn, an ancient Chinese dynasty which ruled over China since the seventeenth 254</page><page sequence="18">century B. C. This calendar is found in the 'Historical Memoirs' of Se ma T'sian, a Chinese historian who lived toward the end of the second cen- tury B. C. Pp. 5II-532. M. J. Oppert publishes text, transliteration and translation of an astronomical cuneiform inscription, first published by Father Strassmaier as No. 400 of the inscriptions of Cambyses, which relates to two lunar eclipses. The record plainly confirms the statements of Ptolemy, book V, chapter XIV, and the two eclipses are those of July I6, 523 and Jan. 12, 502 B. C. (Julian calendar). In the course of his remarks Prof. Oppert maintains that i-ri-hi is not=rl_ moon, as Pinches thinks (Bab. and Orient. Rec. II 207; also Proc. Am. Or. Soc. I888, p. xc), but the ideogram for diameter. The almost for- gotten discussion on the Kakkab mesri, known ad nauseam to every Assyrio- logist, is again taken up, and we may look for a renewal of the warfare between Oppert, Halevy and Jensen on this question. Pp. 533-537. M. F. R-V. Scheil maintains that the Assyrian pronoun of the third person singular fsu, fem. si, is used for the direct cases, while sasu, fern. *sasa is the same, used for the indirect cases, i. e. the accusative and the geni- tive. The plural of su and si would be sunu and sina, but they do not occur. [It would not take much to show that Father Scheil's assertion is incorrect.] The plural of sisu and *sasa are sunfti, sinati, not siasunu, sasina, as Haupt, Akkadische Sprache, p. xxxvi, maintains. Vol. XVII. Pp. I-86. M. Etienne Aymonier publishes a study on the Cam-inscriptions of the ancient kingdom of Campa in Indo-China. This Cam-dialect is spoken by a part of the inhabitants of the province Binh-Thuan in Annam, and with slight, yet interesting changes, by the people who emigrated from Annam to Cambodia. Pp. I34-I39. M. W. Bang sends prolegomena to Fargard the third, of the Vendidad.
