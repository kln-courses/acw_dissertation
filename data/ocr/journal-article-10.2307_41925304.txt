<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ESSAY From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination Originary Thinking with Eric Gans Andrew Bartlett Kwantlen Polytechnic University, Surrey , Canada Taken of Originary Adam together, Thinking Katz's the anthology from publication Hohbes The to Originary the of Present Eric Gans's Hypothesis: Day (2008), The A Scenic the Minimal recent Imagination: Proposal release Originary Thinking from Hohbes to the Present Day (2008), the recent release of Adam Katz's anthology The Originary Hypothesis: A Minimal Proposal for Humanistic Inquiry (2007), 1 and the organization of three international gath- erings devoted to generative anthropology2 suggest a recent infusion of vital energy into the forward movement of generative anthropology. The goal of this review essay is to add a little to that infusion. The essay surveys the six major books of Eric Gans in which the originary hypothesis is defined, developed, tested, and taken onto various intellectual terrains. It has been composed with the readers of Contagion in mind. Insofar as it has a definable stance, that stance emphasises elements of generative anthropology that might encourage scholars and students familiar with the ideas of René Girard but more or less unfamiliar with the thinking of Eric Gans to begin studying Gans free of inhibitions about discontinuities between his way of thinking and that of Girard. This essay's mode is one of affirmative exposition rather than critical suspicion. Its multiple suggestions are advanced in the conviction that neglecting one thinker for the sake of the other does an injustice to both.

It stands as the most austere, abstract, and tax- ing of Gans's books; but by virtue of those very qualities, the most rewarding and the best basis for understanding subsequent elaborations of the hypoth- esis. The Origin of Language may feel odd to readers who come to it working "backward" from later volumes or articles. In it, key terms in the later works, such as "resentment," "mimetic," "scenic," even the adjective "originary," do not figure prominently. In expositions where Gans explains the differences between René Girardi institutional theory of representation (which proposes that language evolved somehow as a side effect of ritual) and Gans's formal theory of representation, there is an odd thickness of cautious deference, a propriety verging on a reluctance to disagree. In Girarďs thought, the maximal form of human culture, the institution of ritual as it evolved from episodes of collective murder, is foundational; by contrast, in Gans, the minimal form of human culture, linguistic exchange as it has evolved in a dialectic of desire and representation, is foundational. Nor for Gans are the earliest "victims" of collective violence human ones; Gans's hypothesis puts an object initially of appetite (most easily figured as food), transfigured by the sign into a desire- object, into the center of the scene of representation. The humans in genera- tive anthropology are less murderous and more hungry than those in mimetic theory; the economic-consumerist element of human beings enjoys a privilege in Gans's system that it does not have in the system of Girard, with its more orthodox otherworldliness. Generative anthropology is about human language. It takes linguistic exchange , the deferral of violence through representation, as the essence of the human. The title The Origin of Language reflects this. Gans's hypothesis is that human language began with a communally mediated abortive gesture of appropriation toward a central object of appetite in a scenic event; that abortive gesture of appropriation is the gesture of originary thinking. Originary think- ing now, even as I am doing it here, does what it did then at the beginning of human thought: it reflects on its own origin. The emission of the first human sign, that first abortive gesture of appropriation, is the object of the hypothesis. The mimetic paradox of rivalry and imitation familiar to students of Girard precedes the emission of the first ostensive gesture-sign, generating the double- bind circumstances that make possible its being chosen. For Gans, the collective violence familiar to students of Girard follows the emission of the first ostensive</page><page sequence="3">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 91 sign; indeed, violence is intensified by the abortive gesture of appropriation- because what was an object merely of appetite before the abortive gesture of appropriation becomes an object both resented and desired during and follow- ing the emission of the sign. Mere animal aggression toward the object before the first use of the human sign becomes collective human violence toward the object after it. But for Gans, it is the sign itself- a sign chosen at the origin by our earliest protohuman ancestors- that makes the difference between aggres- sion and violence. An explanation of this hypothesis concerning that abortive gesture of appropriation and its dialectical evolution makes up the substantial core of The Origin of Language. Reading the book is an extraordinary experience because it opens a genu- inely new way of thinking- of imagining, figuring, experiencing the mental traces of- the earliest thoughts that our first human ancestors may have had. They would not , like ours, have been thoughts in sentences. Like ours, they would have been thoughts scenically situated, concretely figurable, and related to our bodily needs and interpersonal roles. They would have been thoughts coex- tensive with experiences of "naming" central objects in moments of intensely violent mimetic crisis. (In passing, I note that there is as much "violence" in Gans as in Girard; according to the formal theory of representation, our spe- cies was born in a moment of choice between self-annihilation and its defer- ral through submission to the form of representation.) Still, for us, tens of hundreds of thousands of years later, such thinking in the elementary forms of language- thinking in ostensive and imperative forms that only very slowly evolved into the earliest discursive thought- is not a habit of mind we perform "naturally." The exposition provides guidance to the earliest forms of linguistic signification, to thinking through discourse of prediscursive thought, to imag- ining a thinking-before-sentences. It takes mental work to follow the scheme of the evolution of what Gans calls "the elementary linguistic forms." Why should we bother? Surely such imagining is a perverse atavism, something to be relegated to the realm of irresponsible fancy, unverifiable speculation, at best an interesting flight in paleolinguistic science fiction? Not at all. The ostensive reality to which Gans points is no less "real" than the reality to which any act of prayer alludes or the reality to which any sym- bolic performance refers. Theorizing the elementary category of linguistic pres- ence is one of Gans's goals. The promulgators of eliminative materialism and its derivatives aside,3 getting beyond the sentence to the ostensive truth of scenic revelation restores reflection on language to its originary context, a context that is anthropological, ethical, and pragmatic. The formal theory of representa- tion frees reflection on language from paradoxical entrapment in "context-free"</page><page sequence="4">92 Andrew Barťlett models of metaphysical thinking that affect an a priori stance, without ever justifying it, that all truly human thought must be logico-scientific in the Popperian mode of falsifiable hypotheses. As long as human science models itself on the natural sciences rather than recognizing the paradoxical problems of self-reference and feedback, it remains enslaved to a materialist ontology that denies the unique ontology generated by human representation. The origins of representation will never be discovered in a lab, a gene, an algorithm, or a brain scan. Practitioners of Girarďs mimetic theory are better prepared than many to understand why Gans's effort to give scenic form to the origins of rep- resentation, and thus of human science, has value. Students of Girard already know about the scenic structure of human origin. They know it through their familiarity with the figure of the murdered scapegoat: the circle of humans on the periphery gathered around a central significant object, the cadaver of their human victim, experiencing the first form of noninstinctual (human) atten- tion. A belief that the origin of culture must be scenic locates Gans and Girard both on a shared terrain of dissatisfaction with the purely metaphysical. Alike, they subordinate philosophy to anthropology; they both reject pure metaphys- ics for the "situated" thought of revelation, for attention to truths that can be revealed only in the form of a historical event taking place on a scene of concretely interactive creatures. Meanwhile, one way of specifying the differential ellipsis between mimetic theory (Girard) and generative anthropology (Gans) is to notice this: in genera- tive anthropology, it is the scene itself that is ultimately revealed on the scene, rather than the central object alone. The "formal" in the subtitle A Formal Theory of Representation indicates Gans's prioritizing of the center-periphery form of the event over the content of the event. (In Girard, this originary content is the misapprehended and mythologized human victim of collective murder in the scenic center, a victim whose unthematized humanness finds its apocalyptic counterpart only in the extrahistorically guaranteed revelation of the figure of the Crucified.) For Gans, the theory of human representation is "formal" because human representation must explain itself. What the originary abortive gesture of appropriation does is bring the human scene into being: "The formal theory of representation . . . pays homage to the ultimately superior significance, over and above all sacralized objects and significant images, of theory- of formal representation- itself."4 Anthropology is the science that takes human beings as its "object" of study; but if humans are unique because they alone perform acts of representation, then what humans must explain (in explaining themselves to themselves) is the event of representation, that event in its minimal form.</page><page sequence="5">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 93 We present our representations to one another, to ourselves, to each other. The Origin of Language begins to provide a minimal theory of representation. If, for hundreds of thousands of years, humans had symbolic thoughts only in the elementary ostensive and imperative linguistic forms, as the brain evolved from that of our earliest hominoid ancestors to the brain of behaviorally modern humans,5 then human science should propose hypothetical descrip- tions of what it must have been like (or may have been like) to operate and to interact within those forms of representation, with those models of reality. The reader of The Origin of Language is thus treated to reflections on the origin of representation and to detailed expositions of the elementary linguistic forms: the ostensive, the imperative, and the declarative (sentence). With the invention of mature, declarative language, the prehistory of linguistic evolution stops and the history of discourses, history itself, starts; "dialogue" and "discourse" are given delineation in the second half of the book. Throughout, fundamental terms such as "representation," "form," "structure," "linguistic presence," "desire," and "ritual" are introduced and rigorously defined. Each of the elementary forms of language has a unique intentional structure with its own "model" of reality. Gans admits his hypothesis is "really nothing other than a plausible historical scenario for the origin of the intentional."6 Prior to the first abortive gesture of appropriation, there was no animal on earth who could represent to another animal the intention not to appropriate but to represent in symbolic form an object of interest: "intention as a non-instinctual phenomenon is inconceivable in the absence of a system of signification, i.e., language, in which it can express itself."7 It is perhaps simplest to imagine the abortive gesture of appropriation, the first ostensive sign, as the naming of "Food!" in a context where "food" as significant object has been invented/ discovered at the end of a hunting party, where the central object of mimeti- cally intensified appetite is transformed by sign-mediated desire into the re- presented referent. The scene of transfiguration takes the form of paradoxically concentrated panic. The sign- by reducing mimetic tension, however slightly, and making the consumption of the real object minimally more peaceful and less violent (the sign as substitute for the sacralized thing equalizes all in their communal self-differentiation against and toward the thing)- the sign, for its earliest minimally human users, becomes memorable and repeatable even in future instances of such paradoxically concentrated "animal" panic. The atten- tion of all group members focuses unstably on the many minimally self-aware gestures designating that central food object (the sign) and the food object itself (the referent), in an oscillating motion. The abortive gesture of appropriation,</page><page sequence="6">94 Andrew Bartlett in renouncing the central object, designates the central object. It represents it. The scene of representation has taken form. Now this self-conscious representation of the object as significant in the presence of the real object has an intentional structure and a corresponding model of reality. The ostensive model of reality is the most elementary form of human communication and "scientific" cognition: "The speaker transmits to the hearer an immediately verifiable model of the universe as containing one significant present object."8 The real-world limitations of this (to us, radi- cally impoverished) ostensive model of reality put dialectical pressures on it, given the necessarily interactive context of human language and its concrete ecological basis, its economic dimension. The evolution of the elementary linguistic forms is a result of dialectical interplay between desire and reality- that is, between the desire for immediate access to the food object on the one hand and the structures of mediation imposed by linguistic form itself on the other. One intentional structure opens a way (eventually) for another inten- tional structure to be invented/discovered: "It is [the] interaction between the linguistic model and the real world as a potential object for action which we have referred to as the domain of intentionality; the intentional structure of linguistic forms, of which the ostensive is the most primitive, can be defined as the set of intersubjective relations produced by these forms within the presence of the communication situation."9 An intentional structure is not a Platonic form or the brain-contained molecular result of a genetic mutation. On the contrary, "intentional structure" refers to a real-world configuration of concrete "intersubjective" relationships between living animals with biological appetites and social desires, desires now occasionally mediated by the communal event of the shared abortive gesture of appropriation. From that originary ostensive sign, under certain circumstances in the "dialectic of desire and reality,"10 emerges the inappropriate ostensive: the inappropriate ostensive is the abortive gesture of appropriation that names the central object of appetite and desire in the absence ofthat object. From the representational sign "Food!" in the presence of the real thing, evolves the cry "Food!" when the object is not really there; because the object is not there but named despite its absence, Gans names this elementary linguistic form the inappropriate ostensive. The inappropriate naming of the remembered- but-absent desire-object becomes indistinguishable from a request or command by a speaker to an interlocutor that the object be made present, be provided, brought into the center of the scene of representation. The inappropriate ostensive thus evolves into the imperative. Grammarians have always misled us by conceiving of the imperative as a defective declarative; not so- the imperative</page><page sequence="7">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 95 precedes the declarative, possesses its own autonomy, and generates its own model of reality. The intentional structure of the imperative prolongs the dura- tion of attention to the now-imaginary but having-to-be-made-real referent; the imperative necessarily by virtue of its form differentiates speaker from hearer, something (literally) unthinkable in the communal ostensive that equalized all speakers against the one central referent and being: "Where the ostensive merely supplied the information on which action might be taken, the impera- tive includes the hearer in its intention as the performer of the action. . . . The deferral constitutive of the presence situation now becomes an awaiting of the anticipated action that is not merely a subjective attitude on the part of the speaker but an element of the intentional model."11 In other words, the model of reality inherent in the imperative as a "primitive" or elementary linguistic form opens up to include speaker-hearer differentiation and prolonged await- ing. The imperative evolves into a linguistic form bearing a new temporality that will itself evolve into the detemporalized model of the declarative sentence. The declarative has a topic-predicate structure and generates an "imaginary scene" detached from any immediate need for verification of the predicate's reality. Declarative language emerges when the act of predication attributes to the central object the very quality of absence from the scenic center that the imperative, in its calling for the object to be represented, had experienced as given. Predication and the declarative, however, detemporalize the absence of the referent in a way that was (literally) unthinkable under the constraints of the elementary imperative. The topic-predicate structure of the declarative permits the "imagining" of the (missing) object on an internal, private scene of representation independent of the communal reality of its real absence. This internalized imaginary is the originary thematization of absence so widely adored during the 1970s and 1980s by deconstructive thinkers, who seemed to forget that the "absence" is only in their predicating minds and its infinitely repeated textual rediscovery is a waste of precious social, practical time. We may think of this evolutionary development as "Food!" in the imperative becoming "food . . . [is] . . . absent" in the context of the declarative. From its origin, the declarative makes possible the elaboration of "context-free" models of reality. The imagined absent food object is still absolutely different from the real absence of the food. We can understand the meaning of a sentence without needing to verify its correspondence truth. The detachability itself of comprehensible mean- ing from verifiable truth helps specify the model of reality provided by the intentional structure of the declarative, its opening to "context-free" (fictional)</page><page sequence="8">96 Andrew Bartlett models of reality. We can understand the (fictional) meaning of a sentence pre- cisely because we are not, unlike the hearer of the elementary imperative who is compelled to "obey" the speaker who commands, compelled by topic-predicate form alone to verify the (truthful) reality of a given predication by testing it in the extra-scenic world. By contrast, the hearer of the originary imperative is so compelled. But that hearer is our human ancestor, not us. We have sentences. The first declarative sentence was therefore a fiction; far from fiction being a parasitical deformation of truth, testable and verifiable real-world truth has been the double of untestable but meaningful imagined-world fiction from the beginning. Both forms of truth, now formulatable in sentences, the ostensive truth of faith and the declarative truth of reason,12 are one in the relatively leisurely temporality of the deferral they enable, a leisure that would have been unthinkable for prehistoric speakers and hearers of the elementary imperative. There, with the declarative form of language and its opening onto elaborate and richly predicated "imaginary worlds" that can be explored and tried out against the real world of economic exchange (of words and things), the evolution of the elementary forms of language ends. The infinitely variable potentialities of dialogue and discourse begin, now that thinking in sentences opens the human mind in "mature" culture to whole new worlds of understanding, exchange, and mastery of nature. Whole worlds of represented reality may now be tried and tested against whole worlds of reality itself. With the intentional structure of discourse (which grows out of ritual subsequent to the evolution of declarative language), we have an opening to the maximal forms of culture-ritual, myth, religion, and esthetic production and consumption. These make up the subject matter of Gans's second major book in generative anthropology. II The End of Culture: Toward a Generative Anthropology (1985) enlarges the scope of Gans's hypothesis, moving beyond language, the minimal form of culture, and theorizing instead the origins and development of the maximal forms of culture such as ritual, myth, religion, secular esthetic discourse, and economic production and consumption. Gans defines the amorphous term "culture" as "not so much a body of representations ... as an open and dynamic system of representations," and he privileges discourse as the "exemplary cultural form."13 His argument is continuous with the hypothesis in Origin that human language has always served primarily to defer intraspecific violence: "from the very begin- ning the central function of cultural institutions is ethical; they function to</page><page sequence="9">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 97 promote the cohesion of the community at whatever level of complexity it may operate."14 In part 1 of The End of Culture, Gans opens with a lengthy elaboration of the originary hypothesis itself, adding nuance and substance, working out (for example) its relationship to the presuppositions of systems of representa- tion such as mathematics, logic, metaphysics, and natural science. In the last chapter of part 1, "The Theory of Representation as a Fundamental Anthropol- ogy," we are treated to a discussion of the lively public debate between Marvin Harris and Marshall Sahlins over Harris's "cultural materialism." The result of the discussion is Gans's situating of the originary hypothesis in its own episte- mologica! frame, one assimilable neither to the economic-determinist material- ism of Harris nor to the "emic" moral relativism of Sahlins: "the inadequacy not only of cultural materialism but of positive anthropology in general [is that] ... it has no coherent theory of representation ."I5 Part 2, "The Origin of Culture," returns to the prehistoric terrain of Origin , with chapters on ostensive culture, imperative culture, and the earliest stages of declarative or "mature" culture. These include fascinating speculations on ways in which items of archaeologi- cal evidence such as tools, figurines, weapons, and cave paintings might help us give body and color to the skeletal elementary linguistic forms that were the focus of The Origin of Language. Then, building on Marshall Sahlins's Stone Age Economics , Gans presents a hypothesis about the "big-man" model of cultural organization, providing a way of configuring the transition from the egalitarian economies of hunter-gatherer culture to those of the archaic empires, with their spectacularly hierarchical organizations (slave-built pyramids and God-kings) and their appetite for sacrificial ritual, including the bloody sacrifice of human victims substituting for man-gods. With this discussion of "the evolution of ethical conceptions," the stage has been set for the boldest part of the book, Gans's originary analysis of the peculiar Western fusion of Jewish narrative monotheism and Greek secular esthetic culture. For anybody wishing to know what Gans does with the Hebrew scriptures and the founding texts of Greek epic, tragedy, and lyric, The End of Culture is an indispensable read. The book's title is once more a telling clue to its central argument. Just as in Origin , grasping the wholeheartedness of Gans's investment in human science or "theory" is essential to following the argument. The End of Culture suggests that "culture" is coming to its end. But its "end" is neither a lamentable decadent decline nor a threatening apocalyptic collapse. The "end of culture" is, for Gans, the recognition and regrasping of culture itself, by means of a minimal model of its origins and operation: "Ethical conceptions have occupied a central posi- tion in the systems of representations of all pre-modern societies, albeit in an esthetic (ritual or secular) rather than a theoretical form. Today, only theory can</page><page sequence="10">98 Andrew Bartlett elaborate such a conception, and theory is therefore called upon to situate itself at the center of our culture. Human science must become, in this hypothesis, the ťhigh culture' of our age. But this can be accomplished only if it accepts the burden of considering its own culture with high seriousness."16 Those of us who love to read modern novels, love to muse in art galleries, cherish listening to eighteenth-century symphonies, and travel across oceans to stare upward inside European cathedrals might find such a claim about high culture's "end" shock- ing. Before rushing, however, to dismiss the idea as just another icy reduction by another hubristic theory-monger, we must register the fact that Gans's whole project aims to explain the historical centrality of culture, and of "high" Western culture in particular. Few thinkers (if any) privilege the real causal power of culture in the rigorous and uncompromising way that Gans does. "Culture" in generative anthropology, despite its minimalizing of culture to linguistic exchange when necessary, is not additional to the economy; it is neither a pleas- ant sidebar to the "real" history of war and conquest, nor a series of ornamental accompaniments to the "real" history of technology and material production. Far more than dialectical materialism, far more than liberal-humanist ideal- ism, Gans's theory of the dialectic between human desire and cultural form privileges the anthropological knowledge, the verifiable cognitive power, of the forms and works of Western culture. Generative anthropology establishes this privilege coherently because Gans's model from the outset explains human history as the history of open and dynamic systems of representation, in keeping with the premise that the human is (by originary hypothesis) the only species that represents itself to itself in the very act of deferring its own violence and surviving, sometimes even flourishing. Recall that the purpose of culture is ethical Gans is something of a cultural determinist in the nonidealistic but bold sense of believing that the "ethical con- ceptions" inherent in Greek art and Jewish monotheism have shaped historical change. Because the human is the species for which intraspecific violence always has been, from the origin, the problem; because representation of the desired and resented central object (an object whose concrete economic reality weds it to bodily need) is the means by which human violence has been deferred, because of the fundamental reality of human representation, the "ethical conception" of any given society is never just a priestly caste's mystifying overlay on the facts or a side effect of more ontologically precious paths of material causation. Within any given ethical conception, only a limited number of intersubjective ethical relations are possible; religious, esthetic, and scientific revelations aside, people will do only what their culture lets them imagine themselves doing, and they will do only as much as they are permitted to imagine themselves</page><page sequence="11">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 99 doing. Cultural universality for Gans means that culture makes human history. A theory ofc ulture is therefore not something other than culture, not something outside culture that one "applies" to it. On the contrary, a theory of culture properly conceived will be that which enables culture to grasp its own form and evolution from within and that which gives culture the self-knowledge to cease bowing and scraping before those who brandish the explanatory models of the physical, chemical, and biological sciences as the only "scientific" models that are thinkable. Human science still has miles to go before it wakes up to the need to be human science: that is, the science of representations. We can consider now the ambitious thesis of this second major volume in the development of generative anthropology: Our anthropological hypothesis concerning the phenomenon of "culture" is the following: in submitting ourselves to the esthetic (in particular, the discursive) Subject, we accept the localization of our desire within a self-contained universe of discourse, and at the same time experience this sacrificial acceptation of constraint as a sign of our integration into a uni- versal ethical community. This synthesis- tentative, problematic, indeed, essentially paradoxical- is, in effect, that of the "Greek" and the "Jewish," the discursive and the moral, elements of modern Western society.17 In part 3, Gans's chapter entitled "Jewish Culture: Narrative Monotheism" develops the ideas hinted at in the part of the thesis that reads as follows: we "experience this sacrificial acceptation of constraint as a sign of our integra- tion of a universal ethical community." Only Jewish narrative monotheism gives to the West its ability to conceive of a multipeopled world ruled by the one afigurai God, whose Otherness with respect to all humans everywhere implies their moral equality under that God. The idea of a "universal ethi- cal community" would have been unthinkable without prophetic iconoclasm and the historical narrative of one human community implied by the Hebrew Scriptures. The Biblical text is not "literature"; to read the Bible as "litera- ture," a strangely overedited collection of works of literary art unproblem- atically comparable to other such collections on the ethnographic shelf, its figures contained by the formal closure of personal imaginations, is already to commit the folly of obliviousness to its radical discursive uniqueness. The Hebrew Scriptures must be experienced as a historical discourse whose linear- ity extends into the historical present, or else they are not being experienced at all (rather in the way that one who does not "get" a joke and the joy of the laughter it inspires is one who has not "experienced" the joke at all). The God</page><page sequence="12">ioo Andrew Bartlett of the Hebrew Scriptures claims (most clearly in Deutero-Isaiah) to be the One God of all people everywhere; all are equal before him. In differing absolutely from God, all humans are equally and reciprocally subject to the Divine. The power of that egalitarian morality lies in its strong refusal to let any one group or person's "figure" of desire and resentment occupy the center of the scene of representation. Only the afigurai God may occupy the center of the scene of representation. The iconoclasm of Jewish narrative monotheism generates a paradoxical culture without esthetic figures, in which an impossible waiting for real-historical narrative completion substitutes for the tribal compactness of shared esthetic identification. Jewish iconoclasm is always in tension with esthetic figuration. The resent- ment we experience at any all-too-human person's usurpation of the scenic center is none other than the condition given to us by our familiarity with the epistemology of resentment at the heart of narrative monotheism: it is the one- ness of God that gives us the freedom to resent all mere people who usurp the scenic center and dare to take on the role of God (especially when they treat us poorly, delivering nothing although God promises all). As we move into Gans 's discussion of "Greece: Secular Esthetic Culture" and his theorization of the Subject of esthetic discourse (roughly, the implied author), we might begin to intuit that secular artists are such usurpers, substituting fictional truth in their diverse "created" worlds for the one real truth of God's promise to complete a historical real-world narrative. If we in the West remain sensitized to our monotheistic cultural heritage, we can never experience the artworks devolving from their ancient Greek models "innocently," because we are always aware with some residual "guilt" that the maker or artist or esthetic Subject of a given fictional world ("self-contained universe of discourse" in Gans's thesis) has both defied the one true world of the God of the Hebrews and opened himself to the possibility of our resentment (such resentment often taking the form of accusations of "sacrilege" against an esthetic project). Therefore, in a purely esthetic experience as opposed to the religious experience of submissive faith in the universalizing historical promise of Scripture, we must "accept the localiza- tion of our desire." In other words, we must accept an insufficient substitute for the afigurai God who promised to guarantee our moral equality with the very "esthetic Subject" to whose figures we have submitted. We submit ourselves in "sacrificial acceptation" to the esthetic Subject; the sacrificial self-submission implies a residual awareness of the necessary conflict between the promise of a "universal ethical community" guaranteed by the God of narrative monothe- ism and the "self-contained universe of discourse" that opens human reality to polycentric esthetic privatization.</page><page sequence="13">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination ioi Our awareness of this conflict between iconoclasm and figuration, how- ever, does not mean we are condemned to suffering a permanent cognitive tension headache. On the contrary, the difference between Jewish narrative monotheism and the secular esthetic culture that Greece bequeathed us is bound to dissolve in a paradoxical synthesis: Gans will be asking us to grasp that the universalizing of submission to esthetic experience itself makes possible a new cultural universalism, distinct from that of narrative monotheism, a universal- ism not trapped in an esthetic iconoclasm but distinct, too, from the closed- ness of the center to new (ignoble) human figures in the classical esthetic. The "fusion" of Jewish narrative monotheism with Greek secular esthetic culture will create a working, dynamic solution rather than a permanently unsettled mixture. For the "sacrificial acceptation of constraint" is meanwhile also a "sign of our integration into a universal ethical community"; the very localizing of our desire will make possible a social world where all persons equally "local- ize" their desire in esthetic-economic production and thereby localize their vulnerability to the resentment of other such competing producers. Ancient Greek culture, not historically positioned to absorb the moral omnicentrism of later Christian revelations, nevertheless provides the foundational models for all subsequent esthetic experience. Many seeds of secular modernity were planted in ancient Greece. In very suggestive readings of Homer, Archilocus, Sappho, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, Gans delineates the emergence of the human, nondivine, Subject of literary-esthetic discourse- a Subject unthinkable in an earlier stage of culture dominated by ritually bound esthetic production and mythic discourse (where gods acted, but humans played no decisive role). The esthetic can not abolish resentment any more than prophetic discourse can; the esthetic sublimates resentment in its preferring of an alterna- tive imaginary universe that the reader or listener experiences for the price of "submission" to the esthetic Subject. What will be (centuries later) revealed in Western culture is the full human fusion of the Greek-Jewish meeting. For if we makers of representations have all learned to be scenic centers to one another, there will be no ritually sanctioned cause to resent the centrality of any one other. It is the paradoxical universal- izing of the localizing of desire that modern culture will make possible. We will become participants in an (imaginary) egalitarian exchange system of self- creation through a career and the taking up by each of a social "posture."18 Esthetic practices will increasingly usurp the place of ritual institutions. In modern market society, all become equally free "artists," in the minimal sense that all may creatively participate in the economy, contributing to economic life in the postritual world of secular exchange. Gans calls this the "estheticization</page><page sequence="14">102 Andrew Bartlett of social interaction" in the following passage: "The moral imperative [of egali- tarian reciprocity] may be our greatest cultural force, and its formulation our greatest achievement, but in its purity it can not be realized as a positive ethic. In the concrete social context, only esthetic culture permits us to construct an imaginary universe of reciprocal relations. It is through the estheticization of social interaction that modern society offers the only possible path to the realization of the [iconoclastic] moral imperative/'19 The singular historical linearity of Jewish narrative monotheism opens a historical way that will be filled with a plurality of (originally Greek) figures of desire, "free" to create a productive "universe" in which personal projects can be imagined, carried out, and brought back to the market for testing as to their intersubjective value. Each person will become the creator of his or her own discursive and figurai esthetic. But this becoming will have to wait for the historical events by which Christianity's ethic of subjectively internalized centrality "universalizes" narra- tive monotheism by placing in the scenic center the undeniably human figurality of the sacred victim Jesus. Ill Science and Faith : The Anthropology of Revelation (1990) differs from the other five volumes that lead into The Scenic Imagination , inasmuch as its scholarly imprint is not that of a university press; it seems to project an audience less "literary" and more theological than theirs, and its brevity (it is about 120 pages long) makes its absorption less labor intensive. One might recommend Science and Faith to educated nonspecialists coming to the thought of Gans "cold," although a prospective reader's familiarity with the Bible would increase its accessibility. Gans continues the project of The End of Culture by deepening his analysis of the radicali ty of Jewish culture's narrative monotheism in "The Mosaic Revelation" (chapter 3), a powerful account of the anthropological truth revealed in Exodus 3. In "The Christian Revelation" (chapter 4), performing an analysis of the text of the conversion of Saul (Acts 9: 1-9), Gans studies the relationship between the Jesus figured in the Gospels and the anthropological truth revealed to Saul/ Paul. Throughout, the category of revelation is the central topic. Revelation is a type of event that happens to humans alone. Revelation is an event in which ethical truths about the human scene are intuitively grasped or discovered, first by a "called" or "elected" individual and then by the mem- bers of the community, through the mediations of that individual. The truths are not about the cosmologica! order ("nature") but about the social order, the</page><page sequence="15">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 103 human world of the exchange of signs and things: "All historical revelations are ethical: they concern not the natural order, but the order of the human community."20 Revelations promise to deliver to the "called" individual a direc- tion toward an ethic that will prove its pragmatic value in sublimating human resentment: "Religious and aesthetic revelation are society's means for accom- plishing the sublimation of resentment."21 The truths of religion- as distinct from the portable truths of the most successful works of art, which give us socially unmediated access to the formal experience of originary crisis and deferral- have specific origins in historical events at sacred sites (think of Jeru- salem, Mecca, Rome). The truths of religion are not experimentally repeatable like the discoveries of natural science but instead must be conceived as unique, "truths . . . rooted in the particular, in a revelation fixed in space and time."22 As the historical frequency of reluctant prophets and apostles of humble social origin suggests, religious truth is usually first revealed outside the context of strictly institutional religion; because revelation implies change and guarantees an opening to new anthropological knowledge, "Ritual is the opposite of revela- tion. Nothing new must occur there; the only evolution the rite undergoes is the gradual draining away of the truth it was its task to preserve."23 Meanwhile, there is nothing anti-scientific, irrationalist, or supernatural about the experi- ence of revelation: "new revelations of human truth, more rational and by that very fact more spiritual, are always necessary."24 Faith stands beside anthropo- logical science. Just above, we noticed that "theory" for Gans is itself culture, scenic knowledge of the human, not something imposed from outside on cul- ture. Remembering that, we may be less surprised by the mutuality of revelation and the originary hypothesis: "Revelation has for its object the structure of the scene of representation, as the originary hypothesis presents it."25 In proposing the intimacy of the category of revelation with its own epistemology, genera- tive anthropology has no wish to reduce or "do away with" religion, any more than its reflections on the "end" of culture imply hostility to culture. On the contrary, Science and Faith celebrates religion's preservation of the revelations of anthropological knowledge in sacred texts of Jewish and Christian faith. The opening chapter of Science and Faith contains what is perhaps the most incisive critique of the mythic nonevents that positive anthropology in its attachment to gradualism substitutes for genuinely self-critical originary thinking. As a passage situating the originary hypothesis amid the "empirical" anthropological literature on human language origins, there is nothing like it anywhere else in the work of Gans.26 Then in "Revelation and Its Object" (chapter 2), we encounter as the first of the four revelations treated in Science and Faith that of human scenicity itself. We revisit the originary hypothesis, itself</page><page sequence="16">104 Andrew Bartlett the "revelation" of the sign that designates the central object at the origin of language. The hypothesis is a minimal "scientific" model of the first historical event, human history starts there, with the first mindful act of human language. The abortive gesture of appropriation "reveals" central being on the scene of representation, opening up the center-periphery structure of representation itself, with all its possibilities for mediation between humans on the periphery, all its possibilities for dialogue between human periphery and (divine) center, and all the possibilities for the opening of the center to knowledge of the natu- ral environment outside the frame of ritual exchange. Next, Gans resituates some ideas that were developed in The End of Culture under the title "The 'Big-Man' and the Origin of Social Differentiation"27 in the context of inquiry into revelation, proposing a solution to the enigma of the spectacularly frequent (and frequently spectacular) evolution of hunter- gatherer societies into hierarchical empires. What discovery of anthropological truth was it that led humans all over the planet to develop such hierarchical societies, abandoning primitive equality? Gans develops the idea of "secondary revelation," secondary because the originary social equality before the ritual center in primitive tribes is so definitively broken in societies where (for exam- ple) the anonymous labor of enslaved peoples creates monuments to divinized kings that stand in Ozymandias-like inimitability. Pyramids memorialize the intuition of the opening of the center grasped by their inhabitants. In the presence of a pyramid (even today), the self can sense an echo of the revela- tion of the power to sever words from things, " the separability of the exchange of representations from the exchange of things"* My ability to put the pyramid into words or name its long-dead owner does not alter its concrete imposition on my resentful historical self; such monuments are testaments to revelations, albeit revelations certainly different from those of the biblical texts we are about to consider. (Most academic tastes incline to the "immortality" of the text, but there is something to be said for such mementoes as Stirling Castle or Chi'chen Itza.) However, at its humbler origin, as in the potlatch-like feasts given by the earliest big men, the "secondary" revelation belongs not to an immemorially intimidating pharaoh but more simply to a producer of a significant economic surplus, the first "big man," who has heard the call of the scenic center and has thought of really usurping the position of the divinity: "The center reveals to man the possibility, indeed, the duty of occupying it. For it has come to appear, if not empty, then insufficiently full; this is the first stage of the 'death of God/"29 "Secondary revelation" is thus the type that creates the cognitive opening to the evolution of social forms, an evolution that culminates in the monuments of the archaic empires, the Western archetype of which may be the</page><page sequence="17">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 105 Egyptian. Against the pharaoh, the radical monotheism of the Mosaic revela- tion will direct an everlasting challenge, a challenge whose reverberations we still hear today. Hierarchy is never the same after Pharaoh lets go the people of the God who called Moses. Before we turn to the eventful source of the Exodic victory of monothe- ism over the "henotheism of Akhenaton,"30 a glance at the idea of "negative revelation"- a nuance on secondary revelation- will prepare a better understand- ing. What Gans calls the "ethical sterility of the hierarchical social structure" of the archaic empires was a result of the limits of negative revelation. Usurping the center and replacing its occupant does not change the center: "the dream of the peripheral man is simply to change places with the central man."31 But to change places, to replace one human figure of demi-divine centrality with another such figure, is not to change the quality of the center itself. The somber grimness of the cyclical "justice" of pagan mythologies meting out resentment for resentment (weary wheels of fortune, eternal sagas of unequal revenge) is one with the "ethical sterility" of the ancient empires. The scenic center, when felt to be occupied by a rival other, can be usurped only by another rival. The God of Moses will not be such a rival. In the universe of secondary revelation, a figure replaces a figure, but the center itself stays the same- a vacuum for the vanities of all-too-human imperialism: "For resentment is a negative revelation. In the apparent closure of the center, the resentful party finds, or creates, an opening; what his rival does, he too can do. But even if he succeeds in his effort, the center will again be closed. The man of resentment is not powerless, but he creates nothing new. Resentment only distributes throughout the society the revelation that the first big-man transmitted in a direct line to his successors."32 There- fore, the limits of the world of "secondary revelation" are those of a world as yet unchanged by the revelation of the one afigurai God who simply is , inconceivably unaltered by human resentment of the center and human desire to possess it. In "The Mosaic Revelation," Gans builds on the analysis of Hebrew mono- theism that he began in The End of Culture with an analysis of Exodus 3, not hesi- tating to concede the legitimacy of the influence of the oft-interpreted passage: "This text in which the Divine Other reveals its non-figurality is the model for all subsequent texts of revelation."33 We have considered part of the long-term cognitive impact of the anesthetic afigurality of this God in our discussion of The End of Culture . Here, we might instead notice that, in something of a return to the focus on linguistic forms that animated The Origin of Language, Gans offers an idea of what God's reply to Moses might mean, what the name-of-God might mean, in the context of the originary hypothesis. The following passage deserves to be quoted at length:</page><page sequence="18">io6 Andrew Bartlett For the intuition expressed in this symmetrical statement [Ehyeh asher ehyeh] is that the presence of God does not refer back to a name, but only to itself. "I am what I am" and "I am that which is" are only two partial readings that we may extract from the more general truth that the pres- ence of the scenic center is independent of all place and all figure, that it is the sole presence before which man exists as man, but that for as long as he remains a member of a community, for as long as he continues to say "here I am"- this presence will not abandon him. In place of the specify- ing name, Moses encounters the omnipresent self-determination of the "monotheistic" God. In this manner, the Mosaic revelation breaks through the confining symmetry of resentment. It is no longer a matter of replacing the Egyptian gods by another god, even if he be unique, but of substituting for the center closed by the rival Other an open center that is the pure locus of presence The declarative does not refer directly to the world; it constructs a model of the world on the internal scene of representation that all men have inherited from the originary event. The God whose "name" is a declarative sentence makes himself accessible only as spirit.34 The God who refuses to be named other than by the sentence I am that I am is a god who refuses to submit to human desire and resentment. He is not given to obey the "magical" invocations of imperative language, the imperatives that call upon "supernatural" agents to interfere in worldly violence. The center of the scene of human representation is now an "open center" in a way that had been unthinkable. Its newly revealed openness is not the result of God hogging, in some secret mode of imperceptible extension, the center for himself, but on the contrary, the result of God minimally revealed as the very Being of that center, the One who simply cannot be "replaced" because his Being is always already in its place- "in" or "at" the center of the scene of human representations. To all humans everywhere who dare to revere this God, the scenic center will remain equally inaccessible and valuable to all as a perfect reminder of the pure pres- ence of God. The "omnipresent self-determination" of the sentence-as-name- I am that I am- means the guarantee that even if, when we call upon his name, this God does not appear, his nonappearance as figure will be not be a sign of powerlessness or unconcern, nor will it be evidence of indifference. Rather, nonappearance is this God's being other than all the lesser (false) gods who do seem to come running with smoke and mirrors when humans call their names.</page><page sequence="19">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 107 To persist in the mode of secondary revelation and call upon this God in imperative language, as if any of us should wish to "own" the one God now so revealed, would not be a sin or crime so much as a failure of recognition, evidence of our not having "gotten" the revelation to us of the One whose name is I am that I am. Other gods make war with other gods and with men so as to appear in the scenic center; other people fight to have their gods occupy the scenic center or occupy it themselves; but the One God who reveals himself to Moses is the locus of the center itself conceived as a (personal) Being.35 This God is not a "projection" of human desire and human resentment. On the contrary, this God opens up the scenic center so that it can be thought as a "pure locus of presence" that just is , is not-to-be-desired and is not-to-be-resented, because it is God, where God is. This God is who/what/where/when/why/how God is.36 The "not-to-be" hyphenations above may sound like "do-not" prohibitions, but they are best taken as ontological claims, affirmations of a human reality. This reality may be formulated in the hypothesis that if humans are defined by their mutual linguistic presence on the scene of representation, then it is impossible that they may each and all be the One in the scenic center to which they all tend and which they all intend. God is that One for them, instead of being any of them: "God as the source of being is he who answers not to our desire to possess him, but whose refusal guarantees the objectivity of being as well as its accessibility to conceptual thought; we can only learn its truth on the condition that we respect its autonomy."37 This God in declarative Otherness makes the representation of everything possible ("the objectivity of being"), the representation not just of our own subjective gestures internal to the scene but of all things we might bring to it from the cosmological "outside," all things from beach pebbles to black holes. We know things through God in the sense that it is only the peace-full centrality of God that guarantees the ethical sharing of knowledge become a reality. The predication inherent in declarative language opened up an eternal temporality detached from the pragmatic urgencies of sce- nic exchange; the declarative always succeeds the imperative in that sense, in the double sense of replying to scenic necessity and doing better than the imperative can as a model of both anthropological and cosmological reality. Likewise, the God who reveals himself to Moses succeeds and outdoes all other "local" gods in the radical purity of his afigurai presence, his everywhere-ness as the central locus of the scene of representation, conceived as a Being. For any revelation to "take," however, it must prove successful in history. Gans notes that "'false' revelations can occur- those whose path, once taken, shows itself to be the wrong track. The falsity of revelations, like their truth, is</page><page sequence="20">io 8 Andrew Bartlett pragma tic, demonstrated by practice rather than logic."38 Clearly, the Mosaic revelation has proved itself one of the most successful in human history; but that is not to say that the idea of God as filtered through the lens of our origi- nary analysis above was suddenly, wholly absorbed by the Jewish people during the lifetime of Moses. Rather, their faith in this God, whose historical "failures" to intervene when (imperatively) commanded by his people would never make him vulnerable to accusations of nonexistence, was instrumental in their sur- viving the numberless trials to which they submitted as the particular inheritors of the revelation of the only universal God. This faith produced knowledge that had real historical consequences: "The Jewish Passover celebrates to this day not the revelation of God, but the deliverance from Egypt. ... a national liberation was necessary to preserve this revelation."39 The Jews's God was less a rival to the Egyptian deities than one whose absolute difference from the human revealed a mode of Divine being preclusive of any such rivalry; the causal connection between the purely anthropological difference made by this God and the his- torical endurance of the Jewish people as a community is undeniable. "The Christian Revelation" (chapter 4) is so packed with suggestions and insights that any summary we share here will be woefully inadequate. Gans's ultimate goal in it is a fascinating articulation of faith in the Christian doc- trine of the Trinity with faith in the anthropological reality of the center of the scene of representation: "The center is at once Father/master/inaccessible, Son/victim/assimilable, Spirit/opening/intelligible, and this triplici ty is not an arbitrarily extendable series but a closed totality."40 The Christian Trinity is the most complete theological model of the scene of representation. But the more dramatic elements of Gans's analysis emerge in his discussions of the conver- sion of Saul and the role of Jesus as teacher and Crucified One. The essence of the Christian revelation is the intuition that "Faith and persecution are one: to know Jesus is to have participated in the crucifixion."41 Gans notices that the blinding light that stops Saul, far from being a vision of the cross, is a radicalization of the afigurality of the God who revealed himself to Moses. That Saul was the apostle who persecuted Jesus rather than being (along with Peter) one of those whom Jesus personally loved during his lifetime makes a big difference: "Jesus returns not to those who loved him, but to those who hated him. Their persecution led him to be crucified, but his return nullifies the effect of the crucifixion and relieves them of their guilt. These are the first manifestations of Jesus's role as divine savior, a role that Paul will be the first to recognize."42 Gans does not shy away from conceding that in the Christian rev- elation experienced first by Saul, there is a fundamental change in the quality of the God of the Mosaic revelation, a "modification of [the] very substance" of a</page><page sequence="21">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 109 not "immutable divinity."43 The blinding light has made Saul fall to the ground; a voice has asked, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?" By the time Saul asks in turn, "Who are you, Lord?" something has been lost to him. The identity of his God has changed irreversibly: "Saul, the persecutor of Christians, has just understood that in this persecution he persecuted God. But he can no longer recognize his God; he must ask his identity. It is then that he learns that he is Jesus."44 Saul's God now is Jesus, so that the second person of the Trinity emerges as inseparable from the first. In what way does Jesus become the universal figure of the Divine victim? The historical difference made by the Christian revelation results partly from its assimilation of originary morality- the absolute reciprocity implicit in the originary exchange of signs- to a social ethic (concerned with the exchange of things as well). Jesus's apocalyptic moral vision is "a vision of a world beyond social difference," and even as a teaching detached from his personal self- identification with it, its radicality ought not to go unrecognized. Gans sum- marizes the originality of the teaching of Jesus in this way: In this purely moral vision of human relations, each individual is respon- sible for keeping the peace in his interactions with his fellows. Because the social center is no longer operative, it is for each individual to become his own center, recognizing at the same time the centrality of the other. This vision is essentially polycentric; it cannot be conceived as emerging in revelatory fashion from a single point.45 This is a social ethic of morality so radical that, in practical terms, it is not of this world: "the social center is no longer operative" implies a rejection of all political, national, territorial, local ethics. All local ethics- no matter how precious- must go in the name of a radically universal morality. The paradoxi- cal ethic of morality does nevertheless lead us to new ways of social thinking. It leads not only to the knowledge of the possibility of a new internalization of moral responsibility but also to the intuitive apprehension of the possibility of a model of social action by which, precisely because of the universal internaliza- tion of responsibility for the social order, each human person is guaranteed a new value in freely becoming a moral center to all other persons. Ethical author- ity is no longer external to the self, embodied in the resented superior other; each can take possession of responsibility for the self, and hence experience the power of contributing in significant measure to the life of the community. As the sole teacher of this radical social ethic, however, Jesus will be con- demned to be identified with the absolute difference of the Divine. The one</page><page sequence="22">no Andrew Bartlett human who reveals the equality of all humans on the periphery of the scene of representation, who challenges the particular powers of competing historical ethics by declaring the one kingdom of God-as-love, is the one human bound to usurp the sacred scenic center in the very act of taking up the unique responsi- bility of calling all to universal reciprocity. In standing for such a radical moral teaching, Jesus must become the victim of a paradoxical anthropological neces- sity: the one human who really shows the way of love to all humans usurps the scenic center in a way no human has yet or ever will. In this paradoxical sense, the crucifixion "must be" (or Jesus ceases to be human and thus to be himself): "He who comes to abolish ethical difference arrogates to himself by that very act an absolute difference. The crucifixion makes the prophet of universal reciprocity the unanimously chosen victim of this difference. But as Saul's conversion will demonstrate, and as the parallel with the originary scene suggests, universal persecution is equal to divinization."46 One might say that it is because humans as social beings can not "bear" the peripheral mediation of Jesus's radical morality, that they must see Jesus instead in a scenic center where he will bear the burden of our unanimous rejection. Knowing this and knowing what we have done about it, we know Jesus: faith and persecution are one. However, the revelation of our guilt in having rejected the teaching and the teacher is certainly not all that is given in the Christian revelation. For on the road to Damascus, Saul experiences not the abstract indictment of a moral deficiency but the revelation of a Person. The promise inherent in Jesus's moral teaching persists not as a tablet of commandments or an impossibly exigent pacifist code, but endures rather as the irreducible anthropological effect of his person : "The paradox of Jesus's promise of universal fraternity is that it can only survive in his person. The guarantee of this promise will be provided not by a God external to man, but by a God who speaks with the voice of the rejected Other within man."47 This personal presence of Jesus is the reason why the not-merely-academic question of the "historical Jesus" never goes away; those allegedly naive believers who suspect the anti-mythologizing debunkers (the practitioners of higher criticism) of missing a central truth are persisting in their attachment to the fundamental intuition that Jesus's teaching is not detachable from his person. The central figure that we name in the originary event (exchanging the Word, apprehending the revelation of Being) is one with the central figure that we unanimously resent, tear apart, and consume in violence (exchanging things, knowing the fragments, touching beings). The Christian revelation is that we can never forget this central human figure: so the centers of our scenes of representation and the sacred potential of every person are open to each of us and open to every other human being as never</page><page sequence="23">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination hi before. Now, the human may occupy the scenic center without defying or dis- owning God. Indeed, God now "calls" us to see his person in other people. Jesus incarnates that rejected but never-forgettable sacred human figure. Faith and persecution are one; our faith in our act of recognizing the revealed Jesus as did Saul is itself our access to the anthropological knowledge ("science") that the rejected human Other in the center of the scene is henceforth none other than a sacred person incarnate in human form. The revelation of God as human in the scenic center is one with God revealing the truth that all human persons are sacred centers one to another. IV Only three years after Science and Faith , Eric Gans published Originary Thinking: Elements of Generative Anthropology (1993). Its preface closes with an acknowledg- ment of colleagues and students who have taken an interest in Gans's ideas, marking the beginnings of a small, dedicated group that continues to explore the originary hypothesis on terrains beyond those covered by Gans alone. In Originary Thinking , the introduction (chapter 1) provides another updated sum- mary of the originary hypothesis itself and its most immediate implications for anthropology (Gans is a master condenser of ideas).48 Part 1, "Originary Analysis," contains some chapters that reformulate hypotheses presented in substantively different but recognizably anticipatory form in earlier works. For example, "The Anthropological Idea of God" (chapter 2) reshapes intuitions first explored in "Jewish Culture: Narrative Monotheism" in The End of Culture and "The Mosaic Revelation" in Science and Faith , but minimalizes them by situating the idea of God firmly in the originary event itself, as an effect of the experience of the sign. "A Generative Taxonomy of Speech-Acts" (chapter 4) engages with J. L. Austin, Jacques Derrida, and particularly John Searle, but might also be described as sharpening into crystallized, compact form the slow, cautious exposition of the evolutionary passage from ostensive through imperative to declarative elementary linguistic forms in The Origin of Language. Nor are the ideas in "Morality and Ethics" (chapter 3) utterly new; we may enjoy the continuity between them and earlier formulations presented in "A Perspec- tive on Modernity" in The Origin of Language and "The Evolution of Ethical Conceptions" in The End of Culture. Reading such interconnected sections as these in sequence is guaranteed to provide a sense of Gans's thought becoming ever sharper; at the same time, setting these new sections against the wealth of exploratory work in the earlier, more tentative formulations makes their</page><page sequence="24">112 Andrew Bartlett conciseness strike one as all the more brilliant.49 One witnesses the originary hypothesis growing in explanatory power by virtue of its increasing minimality. Notice, for example, that the two-word phrase "the sign" evokes the abortive gesture of appropriation (renunciation of appetite, designation, linguistic pres- ence), the scenic center, the human periphery, object and referent, desire and resentment, mediation, sacred experience, esthetic experience, anticipation of consumption- many "moments" of the originary event are called forth by that one verbal gesture. "The sign" becomes an effective shortcut to intuition. This is only one item of evidence that Gans's stylistic verve allows originary thinking to imitate the minimality of its object, the "little bang" of language. Part 2 of Orignary Thinking. , titled "Esthetic History," opens with a chapter on "Originary Esthetics," and then follows it with a chapter on the five major historical esthetics: the classical, neo-classical, romantic, modernist, and post- modern. "Esthetic History" constitutes one of the most valuable segments of work in the entire oeuvre of Gans; students of literature especially might wish to test its hypotheses sooner rather than later. For it would be a blunder, one we have so far risked, to give the impression that Gans is preoccupied with questions of quasi-theological import at the expense of the history of art. If one were forced to identify the most obvious single difference between the thought of Gans and Girard, in place of that between an explicit preoccupation with (Gans) and relative quietness respecting (Girard) the origin of human language, one might substitute the rigor, detail, and clarity that Gans brings to his theo- rization of esthetic experience, to which there is nothing comparable in the writings of Girard. Before defining the esthetic effect in originary terms, let us consider the experience of the sacred, in order to prepare a rough contrast. Imagine yourself present and participating in a ritual event: the solemn wedding of two dear friends in a cathedral, your son or daughter's high-school graduation, the inauguration of an American president. The experience of the sacred is that of the inviolability of the scenic center: the center does not belong to you or to any other person, and your ritual-sensitive intuition tells you it would be absolutely "wrong"- immoral- to imagine occupying it. (For starters, it's their wedding, their graduation, the president's inauguration, not yours.) Now imag- ine the violence that would follow the usurpation of the center in each case. At the wedding, somebody suddenly objects to the final reading of the banns of marriage and falsely declares himself the husband by previous marriage of the bride-to-be. Imagine a badly dressed, drugged-out youth, external to the graduating class itself, rushing onstage at the high school ceremony to disrupt the proceedings with an incoherent speech, blocking the students (your son or</page><page sequence="25">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 113 daughter among them) who wish to cross the stage for their instant of recogni- tion. Imagine the assassination of the president at the moment of his inaugura- tion. The violent unanimity of the spectator-participants's peripheral resentment against the objector, the disrupter, the sniper whose bullet has penetrated the center, conveys an echo of our originar y experience of the mimetic intensity of that containment of violence consecrating the sacred object as inviolate. Now to continue sharpening the intuition, we must shift our focus from the disrupt- ing usurper in each case and recover the abstract purity of the ritual center: the scenic center at the moment of the vows at any wedding is sacred; the scenic center at the moment of anyone's child crossing any graduation stage is sacred; the scenic center at any presidential inauguration is sacred. The sacred center is protected by the whole community . We are unanimous in submitting to its ritual untouchability. The vows, the crossing, the oath simply are sacred; community membership entails a deep understanding of the centrifugal force of its sacred center. It is "given" that we owe the totality of our attention to the persons marrying, the child graduating, the president taking up office with millions of votes behind him. In the originary event, when gestures of designation/renunciation of the central (food) object hesitate before its appropriation, the object simply is sacred; the object itself seems to be forbidding itself to those on the periphery. Likewise, inasmuch as we feel the designated scenic center itself as inviolate, inasmuch as we are "constitutionally" unable to step back and question our sense of the inviolate otherness of that central object, we are experiencing the sacred. It is roughly in this sense that Gans speaks of the "stable imaginary structure of resentment" in sacred experience, where "the self on the periphery is definitively alienated from the desired object."50 What Gans calls the "universal claim of the sacred"51 accompanies rituals necessarily taking place on the public scene, the center's inviolability reinforced by universal prohibitions. In the originary experience of the central object as sacred, those performing the ostensive sign "believe" (a nonthematized consciousness) that the object itself is forbidding them to appropriate it; possessed by the sense of the sacred, they believe the central object itself is forbidding its own appropriation. In the pure experience of the sacred, one is not "aware" even of the mediation of the (desiring) others on the periphery or of one's own desire; one is aware only of the central object. The "delusion" of the sacred, seen from the outside, consists in the belief that the central object itself is "acting," when in fact it is the signing action of the peripheral humans that is sacralizing the object. The experience of the sacred is limited to the resentment of this prohibiting force of the center: we remain aware only of its inviolate centrality but are driven by appetite to consume it</page><page sequence="26">114 Andrew Bartlett nonetheless. Our scenarios above omitted the appetitive, but we can provide an imperfect analogy of it by imagining our being deprived of sex and marriage, education and graduation, the vote: we must have them; we want them "natu- rally." The equality of peripheral equidistance from the sacred center is one with the concentration of all our intentional energy and (appetitive) attention on the central object, making it inspire awe and seem overpoweringly "there," but not for anybody's taking. Such is the experience of the sacred. There is as yet no experience of individual "desire," not even an imaginary possession of the object. We might say that the sacred is the experience of public centers "owned" by the whole community. By contrast, the experience of the esthetic includes from the beginning a desire for the private ownership of the central object. In our desiring imagina- tions, positioned on the periphery, we imagine having the object wholly to our- selves, even as we sense such ownership to be impossible on the scene. Esthetic experience oscillates between attention to the sign-gesture as meaningfully rep- resenting the central object and attention to the central object so designated as significant. The object is desirable and significant only because of the sign; but the sign in symbolic reference alone will not be mistaken for the object in reality. We will attend to a lengthy quotation from Gans now, to foreground this approximation of esthetic experience: The esthetic ... is the experience of the collective act of designation as itself the source of the inaccessibility of the sacred object. This mediation through the sign is not a mere extension of the individual's fear of collec- tive reprisal for approaching the object. Designation by the sign becomes an integral element of the object itself; this distinguishes the esthetic from the sacred object, the force of which is conceived as independent of rep- resentation. In the esthetic experience, the individual imagines that the object of desire could be possessed, but must then imagine the object as the inviolate designatum of the sign in order to desire it. The oscillation between imaginary possession and recognized inviolability is characteris- tic of all esthetic experience, including that of "natural beauty."52 A useful key here is the phrase "oscillation between imaginary possession and recognized inviolability." Like the sacred, the esthetic sublimates resentment. However, whereas the sacred sublimates resentment with that totalizing focus on the central object itself, blocking individualized peripheral imagining while stabilizing equality in unanimous resentment, the esthetic effect sublimates resentment inside the mind of each individual participant on the periphery, one</page><page sequence="27">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 115 mind at a time, in the oscillation between fascination with the artwork- the sign itself- and fascination with the "real thing" as it is made ever more meaningfitl and desirable by the social mediation inherent in the sign. Whereas the sacred subli- mates resentment on the ritual scene with a staged simulation-reproduction of the originary event as a whole, including the consumption of the originary object (thus the wedding feast and the graduation dinner and the inauguration party ), the esthetic sublimates resentment by permitting for each peripheral participant the private imaginary experience of fictional centrality (content: the desirable object) constantly interacting with reminders of the real object's socially mediated difference from the imaginary object (form: the sign alone). Esthetic pleasure is this "drowning" or deferral of resentment in the individual mind. The private freedom to imagine possessing the center reduces the univer- sality of communal resentment by allowing the private desire to "have" it in the form of the exchangeable sign on the periphery, which intensifies individuality and esthetic sociality at the same time. The experience of an esthetic object may be transhistorical and cross- cultural, its object mobile and exchangeable; by contrast, the experience of the sacred object depends on a unique historical event, encloses itself in "culture," its object immovable and nonexchangeable (thus the danger of the barrier implied by the very phrase "cross-cultural"). Gans writes: "The sacred transcends resentment by concentrating in the center itself the multiplicity of peripheral appetites. But the sacred never wholly transcends its originary attachment to a fixed locus."53 To get the sense of the inability of the sacred object to transcend its attachment to a "fixed locus," consider everything that the Statue of Liberty means to American citizens; think of all that Big Ben evokes for the people of Great Britain. Then imagine dismantling the Statue of Liberty, moving the pieces from Ellis Island and rebuilding the statue somewhere in Los Angeles. The project sounds insane; the statue would not be itself anymore. Nor could Big Ben be taken apart and replicated in Toronto, Ontario, and still be itself. These objects, like all communal sacred objects, cannot be detached from their historically rooted public sites. Granted, the Statue of Liberty and Big Ben have been commercialized, and there is a marketable esthetic element in tourists's experience of visiting them; but the tourists who pay to visit them understand that the object and the site are inseparable.54 Meanwhile, the esthetic object is portable and mobile, just as the oscillation in the originary esthetic experience moved between the sign-alone-as-reminder- of-the-object and the-object-as-made-significant-by-the-sign. Gans continues: "In contrast, the minimal locus of the esthetic is the individual's own scene of representation. The esthetic offers an internal solution to resentment. . . . the</page><page sequence="28">ii6 Andrew Bartlett esthetic [prevents] the stabilization of the resentful opposition between center and periphery."55 "The true scene of esthetic value is not the public stage but the individual scene of representation."56 The individualized, imaginary experi- ence of the esthetic requires neither the communally recognized ritual scene nor the historically sacred locus. The only cultural "overhead" required by the esthetic is the sign itself (the picture but not the thing possessed, the word but not the referent touched) and socially mediated reminders of the thing, other signs. The esthetic object aims to reproduce the exchange of signs in the originary event, but because it does not aim at sacred commemoration, it is not required to reproduce the originary exchange of signs and things integral to the whole event (which ended with consumption of the object as divided into "things" in the sacred meal). Esthetic experience is thus closer to the minimal form of culture, language alone, than is experience of the sacred. Ritual is farther from human culture at its most minimal because it always calls for the "maximal" reproduction of a commemorated event, a spectacle or a show in which specta- tors together participate communally. One needs the pomp and ceremony, the security and television cameras for the presidential inauguration; one needs the high-school stage for the graduation, the church and the priest for the wedding. But to read Charles Dickens, one needs only a paperback copy of Our Mutual Friend. One can read the book at one's desk, on the bus, on the beach, up a tree. Likewise, one can play Mozart on one's flute or set up one's easel in many locations. The esthetic might require equipment and instruments, but it does not demand a sacred site. Mobile and portable because of its origin in access to individuality, the esthetic experience is "free," just as the exchange of signs representing the originary center is more free than submission to the force of the central object's sacred one-ness. Other people must be present-in-the-flesh before the ritual experience; the presence of those people imposes constraints. When having an esthetic experience, one may well be alone with only the sign of the central object (the book, the photograph, the music on headphones); as long as other people in the society are on their own having like experiences with their own copies of the object (the peripheral sign copies other peripheral signs), the social mediation required by esthetic experience obtains. Individualized but still social mediation is a sufficient guarantee of the value of esthetic experience. Western history is characterized by a long slow process of desacralization; likewise it is characterized by the expansion and pluralization of esthetic experi- ences. Especially if one abandons the prejudice that only "high art" is art, one need not look far for manifestations of the dazzling proliferation of esthetic experiences and the relative contraction of experiences of the sacred in our world. The Western expansion of the esthetic is one with the growth of market</page><page sequence="29">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 117 society, the spread of market institutions almost everywhere on the planet. It is often said that all cultures have religion, all cultures have art. We might learn to say with equal ease that all cultures everywhere have always had the market model of exchange, the originary form of which is the maximally free exchange of signs on the scenic periphery with minimal mediation by the sacred center. This model of market exchange as the maximally free exchange of signs with minimal media- tion by the center , we must grasp, is anthropological and not political. We must give it a chance to function as an anthropological hypothesis before leaping on it in a sacrificial frenzy to rip it to bits as political heresy, a monstrous ball of laissez-faire moral indifference to the poor and hungry. Generative anthro- pology holds that culture is the deferral of violence through representation. Human history is a series of experiments in which humankind seeks ways to defer intraspecific violence even as it increases access to the central objects of appetitive need and social desire. The object to which humankind must have access is not only the unmediated "raw" food object that satisfies the material appetite (the one whose causal role in history is mystically overestimated by all materialists from Marxist revolutionaries to Darwinian sociobiologists). The object to which humans must have access is also just as much the mediated "cooked" food object that satisfies desire for social belonging and desire for the expression of personhood. There is no being human without sociality and personality; a human without a society and a name (an identity) is deprived of humanity, as dystopian science fictions of totalitarian states where characters have numbers but not names remind us. Experience of the sacred, too, is one means of access to the central object, in that it is the primordially equalizing experience of the object as equally inaccessible to all- perfectly otherworldly. But the sacred itself is neither economically productive nor inventive. We need individuality and the freeing mediation of the esthetic for that. The freedom of the esthetic is implied by the notion of esthetic taste. We do not produce religious experiences for market exchange, at least not with- out a cost in desacralization of the sacred content being shared. To speak of somebody having "good taste" in religious belief, patriotic duty, or professional allegiance would make no sense. The notion of taste clashes with the element of sacrality in cases of deep loyalty. But the individuality of esthetic experience is implied by the very notion of "taste": "The esthetic ... is an effect that exists in principle only for the individual, as the notion of esthetic taste implies. Art, like ritual, serves to defer conflict, but it operates in the community one member at a time."57 The freedom of esthetic taste differs from "freedom of religion" in telling ways. The state, as "sacred" guardian of political "rituals," must bear the burden of protecting religious freedom, because the group solidarity of</page><page sequence="30">ii8 Andrew Bartlett faith communities demands centralized legal protection. But censorship and propaganda are as close as the state can come to "regulating" esthetic produc- tion. Even then, to censor an artwork is never to stamp out demand for it from those whose taste it satisfies. Esthetic experience, the production and distribu- tion and consumption of esthetic objects, can never be mechanically mobilized in the name of state programs. If propaganda or advertising works, it works because it creates the esthetic effect. Holding a gun to the head of the citizen subjected to propaganda does not guarantee the production of the esthetic effect. Only propaganda (or advertising) that creates an esthetic effect "works." The freedom of the esthetic is one with its unpredictability in this regard: before we publish the novel, before we release the movie, before the curtain goes up on the play, before the commercial appears on the television, before the propa- ganda campaign begins, the producers do not know what will happen, whether it will "work" in the target audience. Gans reflects on this fact as follows: "The institutional refractoriness of the esthetic is the guarantee that the esthetic effect can never be made obligatory, the esthetic cannot be harnessed to any specific institutional ethic. Esthetic experience is our only socially unmediated link with the originary event."58 The freedom of the esthetic is also implied by the notion of "esthetic value." Again, to speak of "religious value" as quantifiable is to do violence to the notion of religious experience. A ritual experience is not "valuable"; for the believer, the money one puts on the offering plate is not cash payment for the experience of worship. But one pays cash for a novel, a movie, or a concert with- out feeling the experience cheapened thereby. (Meanwhile, if the artwork fails to produce a satisfying esthetic effect, one may well regret, after the fact, having "wasted" money.) Gans proposes this thesis: "Esthetic creation within formal limits is analogous to economic production for the market."59 Indeed, originary thinking implies that the analogy between esthetic and economic production is more anthropologically sound than the claim that forms of ritual and forms of art resemble one another more than artistic work and marketable work resemble one another. Both esthetic scene and marketplace, Gans contends, "exemplify the secularization of this [ritual] center as a locus for the manifesta- tion of individually determined value."60 The esthetic and the economic are one in their desacralization of the scenic center. Paying up front for an untested esthetic "value" comes naturally in modern society, partly because one is expressing one's personal "taste" in such spending; even before enjoying the show (or not), there is a certain satisfaction in the expression of one's taste. I will buy this novel; nobody has forced me to choose it. The same choice never qualifies the approach to a sacred object.</page><page sequence="31">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 119 More fundamentally, esthetic value is use value: works of art are socially useful because they sublimate our all-too-human resentment of the inaccessibil- ity of many real-world centers of power, wealth, privilege, glamour, exoticism, attractiveness, beauty, and the like. We "have" in our imaginations, through the reception of the artwork, experiences that we most certainly cannot "have" in real life. The "imaginary possession" helps us rest satisfied with real life; real life includes our submission to the "recognized inviolability" of the special experi- ences that art makes available in the form of imaginary substitution. But a life without any esthetic experience would be a real life terribly deficient and defec- tive; esthetic experience is real experience all the same. The esthetic imaginary is its own "thing," a paradoxically real unreal thing, reducible neither to psychologi- cal illusion nor to cognitive delusion. The debunking revolutionary would have us see in this sublimation of resentment by esthetic experience a dehumanizing stupefaction of pure desire (precultural, prelinguistic desire) for some form of arithmetical equality of material goods. But originary analysis denies there is any such desire unmediated by the scene of representation. Further, there should be no humiliation in the realization that the esthetic experience is only imaginary- there should be no humiliation precisely because and to the extent that other human beings are seen to be sharing (buying, "having") the same esthetic experi- ences we are trying. If there is an equality in the distribution itself of esthetic expe- rience, that should at least be acknowledged before the value of such experience is condemned as delusory. The exchanged sign referring to the esthetic object is not experienced as an inadequate substitute for the real object precisely in pro- portion to its circulation as exchangeable sign in the wider society. How many of us have freely chosen to read the book or see the movie just because "everybody else" has seen or read it? Our esthetic experience is individual and private, but we want the experience to be one that other individuals have too. We love talk- ing about the movies we have seen, loaning out our favorite books, exchanging stories about travel experiences. The value of an esthetic experience is inseparable from its exchangeability. (The odd uneasiness we feel at entering a totally empty movie theater confirms this intuition with a reverse example: we fear being the only one to have seen the movie everybody else has no interest in seeing. "Maybe I should have checked the reviews.") The esthetic object, in these ways, resembles any other type of object produced for exchange on the free market more than it resembles the central object of a sacred ritual. The wider its circulation, the higher the probability that the artwork will sublimate our own resentment as it has done that of other people. The more its power to sublimate resentment is confirmed by its market circulation, the more its esthetic value increases, and the more its undeniable use value is "objectively" confirmed. Beauty does have</page><page sequence="32">120 Andrew Bartlett something to do with goodness after all; but it is the goodness of a decentralized and unpredictable social ethic of the desirable and tasteful rather than the good- ness of the morality of a community of believers committed to an indivisible sacred and its associated codes. The originary hypothesis suggests that human beings cannot be forced into a particular esthetic experience; on the contrary, it is the "all at once" experience of the sacred that requires the coercive reinforcement of communal solidarity. That the esthetic can not use force is one reason we should celebrate its inclusion on the scene of representation. Taking the long historical view, then, generative anthropology proposes that religious institutions, strictly regulating access to experiences of the sacred with their monopoly on ritual culture, sublimate human resentment; but generative anthropology with equal emphasis insists that esthetic prac- tice, the production and consumption of esthetic objects, likewise sublimates human resentment. Western history displays nothing if not massive evidence of the cooperation between the freedoms associated with the market model of human interaction and the freedoms of esthetic experience. The esthetic effect, as we have seen, is essentially a private experience, an individual experience, a mobile experience, an experience associated with portable objects, an experi- ence mediated by "open" social exchange on the periphery rather than "closed" communal attention to a single center. By contrast, the experience of the sacred requires the public scene of ritual, a fixed historical locus, and the equalizing universality of attention to the center-restrictive attention that discourages freedom, innovation, "testing," and experimentation by "closing" off thinking about the object. The hated "consumer society" in which we live might not be ritually condemned with such haste were we to acquire the habit of register- ing this fundamental anthropological distinction between the sublimation of resentment by the esthetic and the sublimation of resentment by the sacred. Food from cookbooks, food in restaurants, fashionable clothing, secondhand clothing, jewelry, furniture, domestic ornaments, house designs, landscaped gardens, novels, poems, songs, symphonies, recordings of music, paintings, prints, posters, the movie in the cinema, the play in the theater, visits to gal- leries and visits to museums, vacation packages, automobiles, bicycles, body piercing, tattoos- the list could continue- all these objects that we produce and exchange in modern market society are esthetic as much as "economic" ones. For the "need" in modernity is not so much the need for the raw material as the need for the finished product. In demonstrating our taste for some of these objects over others, in valuing some over others, not least in simply producing and distributing and using them, we contribute to market society. There is more of the esthetic experience than of the experience of the sacred in this business.</page><page sequence="33">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 121 In "choosing" the sociable freedoms of the more easily exchangeable esthetic centers over the communal unifications of the not-to-be-commercialized ritual center, the West (if not the world) appears to have "chosen" irreversibly the market model of social interaction. Longing in however well-intentioned justice-minded mode for a return to ritual solidarity or an establishment of arithmetical equality is Utopian. One wonders if the Western intelligentsia will ever cease inventing intellectual paradigms to induce feelings of shame and self- loathing (particularly in that captive audience, the educated classes) for this apparently irreversible choice. Certainly, it is possible to attack the market ethic when one mistakes its minimal form for the spectacular inequalities generated by its maximally elastic limits. It is tempting indeed to imagine a behind-the-scenes "they" of profiteers whose servants in advertising and the media have mystified us into following a global "religion" of consumption. But how analytically helpful (let alone hopeful, given the all-but-undeniable irreversibility of the changes) are such analogies, on reflection? If we persist in them, the question must become what "religion" our sense of injustice proposes we should put in the place of the one we accuse. The foundations of green consumerism in medieval asceticism may be waiting for excavation. The more serious question is whether we should be so hasty, in our resentment of "the rich" and our championing of "the poor" (vicarious imaginary substitutes for our resentful real selves), to assume that the anthropological hypothesis about esthetic experience elucidated here is false; to assume that the privacy, individuality, mobility, and flexible periph- eral mediation of esthetic experience count for nothing and do no good. To legitimate a wholesale rejection of peripheral exchange and the market model of society, we must relocate "authentic" esthetic experience to believe that it is actually modeled on the pure equality of all people before the sacred center, a center of political unanimity or ritual togetherness. We must prepare for the boundaries between personal and political to be dismissed as meaningless the instant that they are observed. For those committed to a perspective funda- mentally suspicious of the market model of human exchange at the periphery, esthetic experience is but an attenuated, degraded experience of the communal sacred, and human "realit y" must be ever reducible to communal reality medi- ated by a sacred center. Nor can the coercive force of the sacred center be denied. From such a perspective, the peripheral imaginary is never "good enough"; the central public sacred object must be had and distributed now ; the deferral of violence through esthetic differentiation is despised. At its most aggressive, this perspective leads to the promotion of the abolition of the scenicity of culture in revolutionary violence or apocalyptic fantasy.</page><page sequence="34">122 Andrew Bartlett Originar y anthropology is not a justification of laissez-faire moral indif- ference. It suggests only that to openly value the esthetic freedoms to which modernity gives humankind access is to understand human history as a move- ment toward, in the unpredictable and unimaginable long-term, greater access for all individuals to the real object. Its horizon of hope is not equality but omnicentricity, an open and dynamic system of individualities rather than an arrived-at basis for egalitarian homogeneity. It holds that the object of human representation and consumption can not be known in the purity of ritual inac- cessibility, except as sacred. But it is equally delusional to believe the object can be known in its material immediacy. It can only be known as it is mediated by the experiences of the sacred, and the esthetic, economic, and scientific. It can only be known materially when it is "divided" into pieces of value and exchanged at the periphery. The forms of that division begin with the forms of esthetic experience. Esthetic cognition of the object precedes and provides the originary model for the real-world transformation of the concrete object. Generative anthropology sheds the snakeskin of moralizing hypocrisy that seeks to legiti- mate an under-thought, sweeping contempt for market society and celebrates the slow initialization of mediation by the sacred center (religious or political) and the maximalization of mediation by esthetic, economic, and scientific pro- duction and consumption. Meanwhile, the historical evolution away from ritual does not imply that there will ever be a human society in which the experience of the sacred disappears. On the contrary, the sacred will transmute itself into ever more minimal forms of ostensive "ritual" interaction. The numberless and freely reinvented forms of civility and mutuality, of the dialogue and negotia- tion necessary to human interaction itself at its most "secular," will always have had their originary form in the experience of the sacred center. We may never thank the one God enough for giving us all the freedom each to become a per- son, a little bit different from everybody else. Our individuality is a blessing, not a curse. That it is mediated by others does not make it any less real. Awareness of mimetic desire makes the self more, not less, knowable. We may now consider each of the historical esthetics in turn. There is a clear continuity between "High Art and the Classical Esthetic" (chapter 8) and the more detailed discussion, "Greece: Secular Esthetic Culture," in The End of Culture. New to the discussion in Originary Thinking is the minimal- ity of the model, the focus on the center-periphery structure of the scene of rep- resentation and "the sign." What makes the classical esthetic unique, strange to us moderns, "early"? Classical protagonists such as Achilles, Oedipus, and Dio- nysus are not "self-conscious of being watched by the audience,"61 nor are they ever questioned about the significance of their deeds. They might fear doing</page><page sequence="35">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 123 wrong, but they never fear doing meaningless things. The significance of the self is assumed. Compare the anxious self-consciousness of Hamlet, let alone Rousseau: the difference is visible, since for them, the mediating pressures of social others are inseparable from sense of self. The self in Christianity fears being forgotten in an echo of Christ's lamenting cry on the cross. Not so Achil- les or Oedipus: they identify themselves with the agents of godly interference as much as with figures from their privileged worlds of high social mediation. The scene of classical art is characterized not just by a "taking for granted of the significance of the figures that appear on it."62 More precisely, the lack of self- consciousness about that givenness of the protagonist's centrality is decisive. Human figures have usurped the sacred center recently occupied only by gods; we should interpret classical art as being more about the subversion of sacrality than the exaltation of the human.63 Classical art, Gans suggests, "reproduces the 'interior' of the originary event: the center without the periphery."64 What does this mean? Recall that in the esthetic experience of the originary, our attention oscillates between the object-as-made-significant-by-the-sign and the sign-conferring-significance-on-the-object. The lack of self-consciousness about form in classical art depends on the unquestionable quality of the cen- trality of its content: the protagonist-as-made-significant-by-the-sign possesses a quasi-sacred claim to centrality. The chorus as representative of the periphery is passive; we, represented by the chorus, are passive. After the classical esthetic, formal mediation will have more and more work to do as the forms of esthetic experience evolve in the dialectic of desire and reality. The classical esthetic is accompanied by a non-Christian ethic. Gans writes: "As soon as we feel ourselves the potential equals in triumph and in suffering of the participants of the agon, we are no longer in the world of the classical esthetic."65 The ethical corollary is the classical acceptance of an ontology of hierarchical social difference: neither women nor slaves (for example) belong in the center. Not so for the Jesus of the Gospels, we notice, who loved such out- casts and low-lifes and has gone down in history doing so. Classical art as the most "high" form of art will be the most serenely oblivious to the "inherently ideological" possibilities of "popular art."66 Popular art contains unlimited potential for resentment of the center by the socially excluded. Elitists despise it because they intuitively grasp the threat it presents to their privilege. The classical esthetic has no second thoughts, indeed, no thoughts at all, about the legitimacy of the social ethic of inequality and the right of its mortal rul- ers to usurp the immortal center. Occupying the classical center- even if by usurpation- means being deserving of it because one has "earned" one's place in proximity to the gods. Other figures of the human do not figure in this</page><page sequence="36">124 Andrew Bartlett always-already-done-with contest. The usurper's tragic fate will likewise be the work of the gods, not the work of popular resentment. Much changes with the emergence of the neo-classical esthetic. The neo- classical esthetic is the result of the infusion of a certain content- the morally egalitarian self-consciousness that comes with the Christian model of human omnicentricity- into the ethically "conservative" forms of classical art. How- ever, the foundation remains the same, as the prefix "neo" and the persistent "classical" suggest. The shared foundation of both eras of traditional art consists in their both remaining bound to the public scene. Market society is latent, nascent, and, after the twelfth-century revolutions, slowly growing; but it is not yet dominant during the neo-classical era. The binding of art to the public scene means that until the emergence and contagious spread of the romantic esthetic, the significant remains inseparable from the public. One always wishes to represent oneself in public; there is no such thing as a satisfactorily private self-representation. Only romantics write poetry just for themselves (satisfied with only the opportunity to tell others they do so, representing themselves thus on a private scene that will not, they trust, strike their interlocutors as absurd). By contrast, the neo-classical soul has no inter- est in writing verse that can not eventually be recited to a crowd. During the neo-classical era, there is no such thing as glory in one's self alone; nor is there any resentment of those who claim such glory. The self-glorifying individual is a figure of tragic madness or comic foolishness. Only public figures situated visibly "high" in the social order occupy positions valuable enough to provoke desire and resentment. Neo-classical art is not oppositional to the social order. Its fundamental acceptance of the public as the significant fits with its assumption of the legiti- macy of the social order itself, including the measure of "natural" hierarchical inequality (a measure too much for the romantic modern person) in the social order. We might wish to kill this king and get a new one, but we certainly do not wish for a democratic revolution. Modern art, from the romantics onward, will be oppositional; modern art will oppose the market. But for the neo-classical, there is as yet no market to oppose; there has not yet been distributed, as it were, a sufficient quantity of democratized private property productive of circulating envy. For the neo-classical, the freedom to privatize, to make of oneself a center, has not been discovered- at least not to the extent that the public center (as yet still crowded with enviably impressive figures) appears so vacated as to require its being "taken inside" the self. The slaughter of monarchs and the defeat of "nobles" in the democratic revolutions will hasten the process of the tragi- comic vacating of the public center. Once it is evacuated of ritual substance,</page><page sequence="37">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 125 we internalize its emptiness and privatize it without hesitation. But during the reign of the neo-classical, we still believe in the public center. What is new, though, in the neo-classical? The neo-classical esthetic adds to the classical scene "the representation of the scene of representation itself as the locus of significance of its content."67 There obtains a new human self- consciousness about the scenic interaction between periphery and center, about the openness of the public center to usurpation by anybody , about the call to prove one's worthiness for the center with signs of saintliness or election. Gans puts it this way: "The new 'inwardness,' the awareness of the divinely guaranteed internal scene of representation, must be incorporated into esthetic form."68 One must deserve the sacrificial role of the center; one must reflect on one's worthiness for it and be seen to be so reflecting: "The time of neoclassical art is not merely a moment of crisis [as in the classical]; it is a moment of election, the original model of which was provided by the second person of the Christian trinity."69 The one who moves to occupy the center must now provide to others in society a "guarantee of election."70 The guarantee often comes in postures and discourses of self-reflection, reflection that is certainly not romantic self- consciousness, for one still aims to enter the public scene. But it is an inferiority that generates hesitation before and evaluation regarding the variable means of access to the center. The new intensity of dialogue between center and periph- ery- "What must I do to deserve the center while respecting the ritual order?"- accords to the neo-classical protagonist a personal life that would have been unthinkable for (because irrelevant to) the classical protagonist: "the tension so manifest . . . between the personal life of the worldly subject and its central social role is unknown to the classical esthetic."71 Whereas the classical protagonist is self-evidently significant, the neo-classical protagonist's significance "must be explicitly derived from the locus of the scene."72 The powerful transforma- tion effected by Christian anthropology is that of forcing an addition to the process of esthetic sublimation, an addition that ironically smuggles onto the scene of representation the value of human equality inherent in the experience of the Mosaic and Christian revelations: "The equality of souls is subversive of the implicit dependence of the classical esthetic on an unexamined ontological hierarchy of the human. The new Christian anthropology refuses to distinguish a priori between those worthy or unworthy to occupy the center."73 The "inward- ness" that each human person is believed to possess as a gift from the Christian God, the God who confers significance on each person individually and all per- sons equally (as Zeus and Hera did not), opens up the scenic center by pluralizing its potential human occupants. The gods no longer condemn the divinely des- tined human protagonist to occupy the sacrificial center according to their own</page><page sequence="38">126 Andrew Bartlett forms of inscrutable, inhumane irony. Rather, the one God as revealed in Christ calls humans one by one to the freely chosen destiny (itself an esthetic paradox) of self-conscious sacrificial victim. The freedom in the being-chosen must be put on display according to the model of the voluntary-necessary crucifixion of Christ: "The saint must be shown as transfigured by saintliness Thus the saint is not alone on stage; the sign of saintliness- which is to say, of worthiness of the center- accompanies the human figure."74 These signs of saintliness, most specifically in the new discourses of nonrevolutionary inferiority, are the "extra" of representation that made up for the extra resentment that the radical moral- ity of Christian egalitarianism ever so quietly smuggled into the real political economies of Western society. The romantic is the first of the three modern esthetics. In (literal) spite of the dominance of market society, henceforth the artist will oppose the market. Modern art is oppositional; "culture" right from its origins in ritual has always been culture against the market The self-respecting modern artist, for whom to concede "just doing it for the money" would hint at impurity or risk scandal, must be seen to question, expose, despise, criticize, and upset the complacently consuming "bourgeois" self with its naive, vulgar, indiscriminate, unironic bourgeois preferences: "the esthetic in market society thrives on its hostility to market society."75 The modern artist (romantic, modernist, postmodern) expects art to give people a lifestyle; he is willing to sacrifice himself to the cause of esthetic exemplarity, oblivious to the fact that his sacred ancient models had no such business in mind: "The Athenians had not asked tragedy to provide them with a lifestyle."76 Eric Gans is one of the few cultural theorists able to step back from the seemingly bottomless hostility between "culture" and the market model of society; and to grasp, accounting for as many of the conflicting resent- ments as possible via the originary hypothesis, the structure of the conflict. This is so because Gans does not affect an a priori hatred of the market even as he does seek a minimal model to describe the contributions made by mod- ern art to human history. Generative anthropology is not iconoclastic. It does hypothesize that all successful art is "good" both for giving formal expression to the desiring self and for deferring the incipient violence of the resentful self. Art, like language and culture and religion, preserves the scenic center from obliteration; that preservation is good. But a new set of paradoxes attached to hostility emerge with the romantic esthetic, distinct from but not unrelated to René Girard's mensonge romantique. The most prominent features of the roman- tic esthetic are (i) the private internalization of the scene of representation, (2) the presumption of intersubjective sympathy as a guarantee of the esthetic effect, and (3) the constitutive hypocrisy of romantic desire.</page><page sequence="39">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 127 With the rise of the romantic esthetic, we witness the internalization of the scene of representation: "In making individual intuition the source of its recon- stitution of the originary scene, romanticism effects an epistemological revolu- tion. The scenic center is no longer public but personal."77 The private scene of representational individuality replaces the public scene of figures whose esthetic effect was guaranteed by ritual sanction and hierarchical status. The imperative from the public center that one match one's imaginary self-centerings to prees- tablished figures dissipates; instead, "the internal scene [becomes] . . . the source of the esthetic itself."78 One imagines oneself as valuable, even when one seems an outcast or victim of the center (whether the public would agree with such a judgment or not). There is no longer a guarantee of worthless obscurity in peripherality. On the contrary, one's best bet is to acknowledge the public cen- ter only paradoxically, by ignoring it- which means pretending to ignore it. Under the neo-classical esthetic, the public scene persisted as "ontologically prior to its subject matter"; to enter the public scene in reality or imagination entailed then a guaranteed self-consciousness about others watching. , more likely than not one's "betters" watching. On the romantic scene, one need be conscious only of one- self alone to have the conviction that one's experience is significant- precisely because it is private intuition that one trusts most. Now, in romanticism, one's solitude may be glorious, not deprived. Now, one's "private thoughts" may be enjoyed as having infinite value regardless of their success on the market, because they are guaranteed, regardless of success or failure, to remain one's own private thoughts. Notice that this conviction that the self is significant, no matter what they say , is the internalization of the taken-for-granted centrality of the classical protagonist, with the big difference that now (as the democratic imagination obliterates ritual hierarchy) every single body owns such a private center: children, women, slaves, barbarians, savages, outcasts, exiles, criminals, none are left out of their own scene of rep- resentation. (For how could I, and why would I, wish to leave myself out of my own scene of significant reality? The epistemological revolution of romanticism is irreversible. If we say we are not romantics, we lie.) One's suffering, one's vul- nerability, one's "election," one's being called to a vocation- these all count The omnicentric morality of Christianity provides the model for the martyrdom that one might undergo in proving that one counts. Everyone makes a differ- ence-the difference one makes. Every romantic self dreams of its willingness to "take on society" in proving itself. "Taking on society" in reality often concludes in martyrdom. In the neo-classical era, the public scene would never "appear as a mere extension of the individual's internal scene of representation."79 With romanticism, it appears as just that- an empty space into which the self moves.</page><page sequence="40">128 Andrew Bartlett With romanticism, personal success in the marketplace is an "extension" of personal success; the success belongs to the self-as-center and not to the public center; this latter center is just "there," indifferently, leave it or take it. Why is this so? Because everybody else is "always already" just such a personal, internal- ized center, and all such personal centers are equally internalized. Gans writes: Supply and demand replace ritual interaction as the basis for exchange and distribution. Bourgeois individuals must find the origin within them- selves, pose themselves as ontologically prior to the collectivity; by the same token, the collectivity as thus defined must appear inauthentic to individual originary intuition. The freedom granted to the individual by the social order is exercised as a critique of that same order.80 Therefore, the "ritual center" of the public scene is not any longer a ritual center. It has been "degraded to a locus of intersubjective exchange- a marketplace."81 The only center of sure value now is the center of the private self, of imaginative individuality, on which all esthetic figuration first appears. Whether the figure succeeds in the marketplace seems unimportant at first; unimportant only at first, however, because the artist in the real commer- cial marketplace has a new job, one unthinkable under the propertied leisure or fitful patronage of the neo-classical era. In the context of such bizarre new human equalization in egocentricity, deprived of any stock of preestablished human figures whose valuable nobility or beauty is guaranteed by tradition, the romantic artist must warily approach a self-amassing public with a deep faith instead in intersubjective sympathy between artist and audience. In Gans's words, "the privileged link between artist and audience . . . was a minimal char- acteristic of all romantic modes."82 It is an error to define romanticism exclu- sively in terms of content, of figures of self-martyring exile; on the contrary, the romantics's real "criterion of originality" was the value of sympathetic communication between individuals, "authentic intimacy."83 Certainly, there inhered a certain absurd lack of self-examination in the conviction of romantic artists that "their privileged experience was that of everyone"84 when in fact it was not ("everyone's privilege" being itself a romantic oxymoron). We are acutely aware in the postmodern victimary era that to claim for one's experi- ence a "universal" use value is a lightning-quick circuit to the claim's being zapped into oblivion on the spot: "How can the terms of your deprivation ever resemble mine so significantly as you suggest? I differ from you!" But such hopeful claims of democratic solidarity did freely circulate at the dawn of the romantic era. No offense was automatically taken at the presumption as such</page><page sequence="41">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 129 in "the romantic presumption of the natural communion of souls."85 Only with modernist aggression would this now fragile-seeming faith in esthetic commu- nion be shattered irreparably. The constitutive hypocrisy of romantic desire shows itself in the way in which the exceptionality that the romantic self pursues in self-differential oppo- sition to the market serves in reality to confirm that market forces have become the rule , because the market circulates rather than blocking such differences. Gans defines this feature as follows: "The romantic ... is in principle hostile to the market. But the romantic lifestyle ... is in fact a preparation for life and career in market society. This is the constitutive hypocrisy of romanticism."86 As uncountable millions of romantic souls in democratic market society have learned by the time they have attained adulthood, the market- frequently to the embarrassed surprise of rebellious younger selves- wanted them all along to learn to be different. The romantic artist pretends to oppose the market only until he learns that in learning to be different from all those consumers who seem to be the same (except for him), he has produced something new and different, such that he himself, the market-hating artist, is now in demand. This narrative is the common property of millions of people; it is the shape of initiation into a career in market society. Unsuspecting conformity to pro-market "possessive individualism" is one with studied cultivation of anti-market "romantic rebel- lion": the two converge in the creation of the very differences that the market must circulate in satisfying many different desires and deferring many different resentments. The process requires many different individual human persons , and it must have their individuality- it requires their learning to be different (oppo- sitional). For the romantic paradox is that one's badly wanting to be different, to be oneself alone, is the best guarantee that one will find ways to belong to modern society. Market society is the paradoxical society where everybody is alike in desiring to be different because everybody resents whatever is on the market at the time as too much already of the always-the-same. Even learning to affect the romantic-indifferent "bored with it all" stance forces one ultimately to create some differentiating excitement that will be attractive to others who are likewise "bored." Hatred of the market creates a market for itself. This situation of the romantic self in market society is, in Gans's words, this: "the romantic paradox of the incomparable individual whose uniqueness is in fact determined by comparison with others."87 Individuality is alienation only when we presuppose that the experience of the ritual sacred is a more "authentic" form of human interaction than the freer and more socially differ- entiating mediations of the esthetic. For the freedom of the romantic esthetic is a freedom to make oneself desirable, enviable, beautiful, useful, and creative</page><page sequence="42">130 Andrew Bartlett for the notice of others, as such making is mediated by myriad choices rather than in conformity to a model prescribed from the public center (religious, political, or legal). From an originary perspective that views liberation from the sacred as real liberation, romantic individualism releases vast reservoirs of human potential for esthetic creativity. It is nothing other than esthetic differ- ences that get exchanged in the marketplace. That which can neither be divided nor exchanged, and has no market value, is the "priceless" sacred object. The modernist esthetic casts off the hopeful anthropology of the roman- tics; its sometimes terrorizing experimentation with form and its restless search for decisively new content hide a near-despair about the apparent powerlessness of esthetic experience to transform the world of practical human experience. Under modernism, not just the market but "consumer society" has become the enemy. Consumer society is harder to beat, for its institutional philistinism appears victorious. The self-contradictory elitism of modernism's revolution- ary aims bars it from access to the popular appeal achieved by romantic artists. Henry James will never be loved as much as Charles Dickens; nor will Virginia Woolf sell like the Brontë sisters. Modernism will permit almost any object to cut a figure in the scenic center as content. Gans remarks on these trends: "modernism affirmed the lived experience of desire despite and even because of the triviality of its object,"88 "all desiring experience is equally . . . suitable for esthetic representation,"89 "Modernism is a panestheticism; all experience is fit matter for art."90 The insistence on the value of bizarre content finds its comple- ment in the formal innovativeness of modernist practice (Joyce's Ulysses , Eliot's fragmented Waste Land , imagism, futurism, surrealism, cubism, the afigurality of abstract art, the 12- tone scale). The goal of withholding content of obvious significance is to force the bourgeoisie to recognize the primacy of form: "The inescapable nature of form is demonstrated ... by the insistence on the appar- ently trivial nature of the material that provides the pretext for the artwork";91 "For the modernists, the new is above all the ephemeral; what is ever new is continually being replaced. The triumph of esthetic form can only reveal itself at the expense of the permanence of its content."92 What are the ethical implications of this esthetic of the trivial, the fragmentary, the ephemeral, the shocking, all such materials mediated by the foregrounding of form? Gans summarizes the communicative goal of modernist art thus: "One must shock the bourgeois in order to demonstrate that human beings are not bound by the limits of practical experience."93 Lan- guage and representation as forms of "practical experience" are "bound" by the scene of representation, but the modernist reaches deep and far outside the bourgeois everyday in the hope of getting outside the scenic itself. The</page><page sequence="43">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 131 modernist is convinced that consumer society has induced in humanity a state of massive stupefaction ("like a patient etherized upon a table") and puts up a fierce resistance to its own becoming stupefied. Romantic faith in the power of intersubjective sympathy to organize social desire and resentment for humane purposes is dead and gone. Now it is "an inauthentic collectivity" that stands opposed to the "'authentic' individual, the real subject of experience."94 Addi- tionally, the romantic esthetic had retained from its classical and neo-classical roots a belief in esthetic totality, a belief in the "unspoken harmony between tradition and the artist's intuitive sense of the experiential equivalent of the originary scene."95 The romantics were still searching for a model of "tran- shistorical experience," but their vision still assumed that the privatized self could enter the human community. For the modernist, the harmony between tradition and esthetic intuition is dead and gone. Instead, one is provoked to trust the intuitions that well up from the ahistorical depths of one's primal, animal, "unconscious" self. It is this shocking-when-unleashed precommunal desire that provides the unthematized human universal, the key to modernist anthropology. However, the solution of valorizing only those intuitions rooted in a "desire" anterior to the historical mediations of the scene of representa- tion means trusting in what, for generative anthropology, is a fancied leap into (the absurdity of) unmediated desire. And yet this notion of desire not mediated by the sign is not unfamiliar to the postmodern intelligentsia. Wit- ness the everlasting prestige of the incorrigibly individualized psychology of the Freudian framework, obsessed with objectai cathexes according to which desire belongs to "the body" or "the drives" (especially the determinative drives of the child), rather than being born with the sign in an event on a scene of representation. Perhaps the single most potent paragraph in Gans's chapter on the modernist esthetic is the following, taken from a subsection headed "The Precommunal Scene": The modernist understands the esthetic scene as giving access not to the originary event of the human community but to a precommunal essence of desire. Romantic originarity is always implicitly communal; "society" is evil only because it is a forgetting of authentic community. The romantics never lose faith in the subsistence of a virtual community with which every self is accessible to every other. In contrast, modernism does away with the community even at the origin. For the moderns, humans' primordial (unconscious, instinctive) desires are more originary than human beings themselves. The human being is an animal whose naturally violent drives have been restrained by civilization. As the promotion of psychoanalysis</page><page sequence="44">132 Andrew Bartlett by the surrealists attests, the Freudian view of humanity stands on com- mon ground with the modernist esthetic.96 Notice the modernist's proposals: we may have to do away with community somehow, civilization restrains natural drives to violence, animal appetite is more authentic than human desire. The more disturbing of the possible implications of such positions must be confronted. Gans dares to point out "the uncomfortable parallel between the esthetic and the political terrorisms of the modernist era," even though he adds: "Esthetic terrorism in itself had no significant political consequences."97 Modernism lacked an anthropologi- cal model adequate to the ethical vacuum created by its exploitation of the intuited afigurality of the central locus of the scene. The aberrant socialisms of Hitler, Mussolini, Lenin, and Stalin filled that vacuum at the center with figures of self-glorifying totalized violence, whereas the scene of human rep- resentation from the origin had always been intended to contain violence in a figure, not to explode the scene in the dream of a desire for a purifying violence thought somehow to exist outside of form itself, as if form were oppression. Romantic culture has always accused the market model of failing to produce the equal society of democratic dreams. But "culture" failed to produce the same thing most spectacularly in the "cultural" experiments of political mod- ernism. Meanwhile, modernism in art rather than politics still retains a certain nostalgic value as the necessary intensification of an overconfident romanti- cism disempowered by the triumph of consumer culture. Most extremities in modernist art belong among the courageous responses to the extreme horror of the two major European wars; in the face of such a horror, it would have been difficult for anyone to stay hopeful in ways that had worked a century earlier. Modernism's anti-social aggression and elitism were accompanied by a self-disciplined asceticism and defiance of despair that we ought to respect. The last of the "Esthetic History" chapters is the most tentative. In "The Postmodern Esthetic," Gans offers a variety of intriguing descriptive formulas, only a few of which we touch on here. For generative anthropology, the post- modern era begins with Hiroshima and Auschwitz. "Hiroshima" names the irreversible revelation that humans have come to possess the means for their own self-annihilation. "Auschwitz" names the revelation that humanity has found it possible to perform hitherto unthinkable horrors of intraspecific vio- lence on a sceneless space outside the history of sacrificial structure. Gans has more than once suggested that the appearances of both his own hypothesis of language origin and Girard's mimetic theory of violence were dependent on the anthropological truth opened to intuition by these historical revelations.</page><page sequence="45">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 133 The originary identity of the human as the species bound either to find ever new ways of deferring intraspecific violence through representation or to meet with self-extinction could not have been intuitively grasped prior to Hiroshima and Auschwitz. The postmodern ethic of the victimary, the reduc- tion of social relationships to those of persecutor and victim as a means of gaining moral ground and political favor, enters the human scene alongside this contagiously-spreading-out consciousness of the potential limitlessness of human violence. The victimary ethic seems to fancy that human persons living after Hiroshima and Auschwitz might recover in the exquisiteness of interpersonal "sensitivity" what they have lost in illusions about the apocalyp- tic redeemability of the human. Meanwhile, the postmodern esthetic after 1945 grows and flourishes in the liberal West. In the postwar world, the creeping disillusionment with cul- tural totalitarianism accompanies an acceptance of market society. Modernist aggression against the market is traded for postmodern irony toward the mar- ket. One learns to take the philistinism of consumer society seriously by inven- tively affecting not to take it seriously. The postmodern esthetic, according to Gans, visibly differs from the modernist, in that it renounces "the opposition of culture to the market."98 It appears to concede that commercialization is not a mode alien to the esthetic that must be bypassed, but rather one open to exploi- tation in the service of esthetic production: "The postmodern no longer believes in the esthetic communion of souls beyond the market; from artist to audience, the essential relationship is that of value added."99 Van Gogh paintings appear on greeting cards; the subcultural rock star becomes a baronet toasted by the queen; melodies of Mozart and Beethoven become ringtones on cellphones. Nobody scowls; nobody blinks; a few elitists sigh from a distance. We witness "the end of the heroic model of esthetic progress."100 The selection of forms, styles, figures, and techniques for parody, pastiche, and other modes of ironic reassembly and quotation is a matter of indifference to the working artist, insofar as no style is believed to give more immediate access to anthropological intuition than another. It becomes clear that postmodernism "no longer feels obliged to situate form within a historical dialectic."101 The postmodern denial of its own historical situation is reflected in a tacit standoff with the appar- ent assimilation of the dialectic between desire and reality to the recirculation of resentments in market exchange: "the entire process of esthetic evolution comes to be anticipated by and absorbed into the market."102 Once the exchange of esthetic objects has become indistinguishable from the exchange of objects as such, "culture" has dissolved into the market in a meta-panesthetic irony: "The esthetic triumphs in the postmodern era by becoming indistinct from</page><page sequence="46">134 Andrew Bartlett perception- indeed, from experience in general."103 What this suggests is that consumerism and estheticism are somehow wedded into a coupling alternately perverse and serene. The sneaking of the postmodern vagrant toward an exit from the theater of history, however, will turn out to be an opening of the doors of that theater to human science. Let us return to the minimal esthetic experience of the aborted gesture of appropriation in the originary event: recall the oscillation between atten- tion to the central object-as-mediated-by-the-sign, dependent on the sign for desirability and significance but still to be consumed; and attention to the sign- as-referring- to- the-object on the periphery, fascinating in itself but doomed to exhaustion (one consumes the thing, not its representation). The originary esthetic oscillation may be superimposed on the postmodern dissolution of the high-art/popular-art dichotomy, the dissolution of the "opposition between art renouncing desire for the sake of signification and entertainment anticipat- ing consumption."104 The postmodern esthetic, according to Gans, situates its wry affirmations in "the undecidability between the two."105 Its ironic stance aims to foreground without masochism "the meaninglessness of the deferral of desire."106 What would it mean for the deferral of desire to be meaningless? There is no difference, the postmodern pose wishes to suggest, between aware- ness of the undecidability between high and popular art and ignorance of it. To be aware of the undecidability means that one "gets" the end of history: since we now know there is no "outside" to the market, the romantics's and modern- ists's search for the basis of transhistorical experience to legitimate cultural opposition to commercial culture must be rejected as passé. We get the way that value is added by letting high culture slide imperceptibly into the consumed. There is no point in "deferring" the desire for centrality when centrality is so easily had anyway: just let it be on the market. To be "ignorant" of the undecid- ability is to imitate, ironically, those altogether oblivious to the mere question of the distinction, the philistines that the modernist would have despised. One is no longer to entertain contempt for those who do not share one's awareness of this historical passage into esthetic ahistoricity. Indeed, since the happily unknowing popular consumers have no more to gain from the knowledge of the undecidability than we do, their ignorance will make no difference to them. Our knowledge makes no difference to us, so what is the esthetic or ethical point in insisting that they get the knowledge so as to have it make a difference to them? The deep presupposition of this doubleness is that even the most spectacular worldwide commercial success of an esthetic movement would not change human history. History is impermeable to esthetic intervention,</page><page sequence="47">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 135 because commercial success permeates esthetic success on the scene of the "end of history" where the market seems indefinitely triumphant. We can discern how Gans situates the postmodern esthetic more exactly in the long view of human history by considering two incisive passages, beginning with the following: The decline of high culture that begins in the romantic era ... is a product of the inexorable movement of human self-consciousness toward inclu- sion of the totality of the scene within the individual imagination. As the market, having become the central social institution, comes to incite and focus desire rather than simply satisfying it, it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish between the disinterested contemplation of the inaccessible object and the anticipation of its consumption.107 If the market is "inciting and focusing" desire, then it is appropriating to itself the very function of esthetic experience. For it was historically the vocation of the esthetic to provide the human subject with figures of formally situated desire ("focusing") and to defer resentment of the center closed to desiring appropria- tion ("inciting"). What work remains to be done by the suddenly disarmed art- ist in a centerless-omnicentric world where almost any producer-distributor of objects (from the tacky and tawdry to the exquisite and expensive) is now right- fully called to the once-upon-a-time sacred, or at least exclusionary, vocation of architect, painter, sculptor, musician, conductor, storyteller, novelist, versifier? There must be something left to do with one's esthetic self. So the cultivation of the doubled awareness and (affected) ignorance of the undecidability outlined above keeps one busy in one's greenhouse garden. Gans continues: Its metavision of human history [postmodernismů] is indifferently with- out crisis and all crisis. For the postmodern, the scene of representation is not natural and transparent, but conventional and opaque. This opacity is a screen before the origin that makes it esthetically unfigurable, but it is at the same time a foregrounding that forces the scene-in-itself, devoid of the familiar figures of the sacred, upon the theoretical consciousness. The postmodern esthetic is constituted by its exit from esthetic history, by its rejection of the idea that a vision exists that transcends all other visions, or at least all previous ones. But this refusal of art is an invitation to science. What cannot be figured as an object of experience must become the object of a hypothesis.108</page><page sequence="48">136 Andrew Bartlett What would it mean for the scene or scenic center to be figured as "an object of experience"? Or to be figured as "an object of a hypothesis"? If it is an object of experience , then the work of the esthetic is being performed: one is holding onto a vision of the originary scene that one can make visible to others, exchange with others. My object of "experience" can become yours, and yours mine, even if we share only the unbearably light figure of postmodern undecidability. But any such vision-quest for an exchangeable "experience" is the very histori- cal business that the wised-up postmodern soul has closed out. Faith in the effectiveness of the exchangeability of any such esthetic vision to make his- tory in history has been renounced. Once more, what is left? We consider the notion of "an object of a hypothesis." Neither culture nor the market alone, but along with them "theoretical consciousness"- an "invitation to science"- stands confidently with its hand extended. The originary hypothesis itself is an exchangeable "object" that (as we have seen) minimally generates itself. The originary hypothesis refrains from attempts to "close" history or "end" his- tory as any concentrated sacrality or esthetic fixation necessarily intends. In its minimality as a gesture of representation that represents the scene alone, the scene as the only "figure" the human needs, the originary hypothesis that the deferral of violence through representation is our first and best gesture, opens up the pragmatic scene of resentment, desire, becoming, being, and thinking. It opens it perpetually to dialogue; every dialogue has its own form- there is no one form of dialogue. The originary hypothesis gives us a way to have a conversation about the future- a conversation that even the disillusioned postmodern self may join. For this minimal hypothesis is most certainly not inviting us to science, as in "science opposed to art"; it is not science as a supe- riorist rejection of the "humanities." It is science as human science, done by humans about humans for humans. If our sketch of Gans's outline of esthetic history has done anything, it is to be hoped that it has shown the way originary thinking puts human language, religion, and art at the center of its own scene of representation. Generative anthropology is a minimal science (practical knowing) of the human. V With Signs of Paradox: Irony , Resentment , and Other Mimetic Structures (1997), Eric Gans sharpens the originary hypothesis again. He nudges it into philosophi- cal confrontations with (for example) logic, "truth," irony, the "concept" in Plato, "Being" in Heidegger, and psychoanalytic categories (the erotic, the</page><page sequence="49">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 137 unconscious). He brings it to bear more directly than before on the politics of resentment in contemporary American culture, with reflections on the Holocaust, victimary discourse, political correctness, and "double-minoritary" culture (the fusion of youth culture and the minority). Two reformulations of the theory determine the direction of the particular observations in the book and the accent in which they are presented. The first is a new foregrounding of mimetic paradox: from the outset a fundamental element of generative anthro- pology, here paradox as the expression of crisis is promoted to the minimal structure not-quite-governing the human event of representation. Thus we have the title "Part One: Paradoxical Thinking." Gans announces as well a "return to Girard." The foregrounding of paradox entails a reexamination of the Girardian triangle of model, obstacle, and object of contention. But a newly intensified vision of the moment of the originary sign's collapse into inadequacy and the unleashing of resentment against the object restores the horror of human vio- lence to the event; thus the title "Part Two: Sparagmos and Resentment." To sketch the move to the new foregrounding of paradox, let us consider an element of the originary hypothesis that Gans here designates as a natural- istic accretion to be purged from the minimal scene. It is the requirement that the aborted gesture of appropriation be motivated by fear of the aggression of the other protohumans on the periphery. The crisis so described smuggles in an ethological ingredient, the presupposition of a breakdown of hard-wired dominance patterns in primate social hierarchy. Gans downplays the element of "fear" in the new formulations of this volume: "The determining factor in the conversion of the appropriative gesture into a sign is not fear of the violence of the other(s), but the incompatibility of the two roles of subject and other in the mimetic process."109 The crisis of incompatibility is assimilable to "the subject's state of undecidability between the mimetic other-mediator's two roles of model and rival."110 It follows the process of acquisitive mimesis degenerating into conflictual mimesis, the "positive" model becoming the "negative" rival, the subject-rival and model-obstacle becoming indistinguishable from each other even inside the structure, within their own doubled minds: mimetic madness. For a circular model positioning two subjects on the periphery of the circle equidistant from a central object, Gans substitutes the triangular model of two subjects and one object. This is a resetting of the originary event to its minimal form. Gans thus redefines the originary hypothesis: [The] sign originates as the solution to the "paradoxical state" or "prag- matic paradox" engendered when the mimetic relation to the other- mediator requires the impossible task of maintaining the latter as model</page><page sequence="50">138 Andrew Bartlett while imitating his appropriative action toward a central object. Put in geometric terms, the parallel lines of imitation must converge toward a single point. The mimetic obstacle is both model and (potential) obstacle; it is at the moment when this contradiction appears that the human lin- guistic sign appears.111 This return to a less "naturalistic" triangularity does not imply that "fear" must be disqualified altogether from inclusion in the description of histori- cal instances of the scene. We are not being commanded to render skeletally geometrical the flesh-and-blood creatures participating in the originary event. The animal appetites of the human persist, just as the concrete reality of the object as "external" datum (food, materiality, cosmological otherness) persists. This triangle- as readers of Girard know perfectly- is no ideal entity. Gans's modification argues only that if we wish to think in the most minimal terms of the scene of human representation, then we do best to include in that thinking only the terms that generate the sign. Animali ty and the appetitive object of need are presupposed; this is not an immaterial vacuum in outer space. But the preexisting "fear" of aggression is not a necessary condition of the pragmatic paradox of mimesis; on the contrary, it is the pure situation of pragmatic para- dox that may generate the dangerously concrete fear. This return to trangularity is part of the "return to Girard." It will dovetail with the restoration of originary violence to its priority, but the return will be easier to understand if we pause and reconsider the originary esthetic. After our survey of the esthetic history outlined in Orignary Thinking , the slight demotion of the esthetic in Signs of Paradox to a less essential role might seem odd. But Gans has never hesitated to cut down to size the heuristic instrument itself when a possibility is discovered for its being sharpened to a more incisive minimality. The triangularity of the pragmatic paradox of subject and model-obstacle lends a hint of secondariness to the oscillation of attention in esthetic expe- rience. No longer is the esthetic essential to the origin of form itself: "in the present discussion, we stand at the origin of form, which [form] we must explain without recourse to the notion of the esthetic."112 Much is at stake here in the minimalization that permits the removal from the origin of form of the neces- sity of the Kantian free "judgment without a concept."113 Previously, the structure of the experience of the sacred (as we saw) had a certain austere rigidity about it: the object could be known only in its unknowability. The sacred object was accessible only in its inaccessibility, untouched and unhandled. (The violence of the sparagmos is desacralization.) That stays the same; but something happens in</page><page sequence="51">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 139 triangularity to the relation between sign and object. Because of a new empha- sis on and clarity with regard to the sign's possession of an originary "formal closure," an addition of quality to the originary knowledge of the sacred object accompanies that emphasis. In the Originary Thinking account, the sign-user on the periphery can examine his gesture itself and experience it alone as the sign- referring-to-the-object, as the signifier; or he can examine the central object-as- referred-to-by-the-sign, the referent. But the stability of the alternative implied by the conjunctive "or" falsifies the unstable necessity of esthetic oscillation: there is no alternative, only alternation. The paradoxical oscillation persists until the esthetic experience as such ends when the "beauty" of the sign-referring-to- the-object is exhausted and appetite moves the sign-users to close the circle in the violence of consumption, de-figuring and distributing the valuable pieces of the now-divided object."4 Here in Signs of Paradox, along with canceling the neces- sity of the element of "fear" in the minimal event, Gans removes from the event a certain inadequacy of the sign-gesture itself For inasmuch as the sign-gesture's "closure" was subject to the circular scenic form of esthetic oscillation, it did not present itself alone a satisfactory "imitation" of the object. The result of Gans's new focus on triangular mimetic paradox is not only the deletion of the circular- ity characteristic of the center-periphery model. There is the additional result of a greater degree of "imitation" between the originary sign and the object. Let us linger over the effects of the return to triangularity. Perhaps syn- chronic with the way the subject needs only one other human mediator for the mimetic paradox to "work" (rather than a plurality of others on the periphery), the relation between the sign itself and the object itself gains a kind of linear- ity of intimacy, as if benefiting from the subtraction of contextual distractions inherent in the circular model. Gans posits a new matching of ostensive sign and represented already-present-to-the-senses object, such that the object is "imitated" by the sign itself in its own "formal closure" as an object. The form of the sign itself thus "imitates" the form of the scene of representation itself with a new, of-its-own generative power. I noted above in my opening remarks on Originary Thinking that the two-word phrase "the sign" had a new potency; here in Signs of Paradox there is an intensification of the same process. It is as if the new decisiveness in the "formal closure" of the sign itself now substitutes for the decisiveness of that closure of the scene, the collapse of the circle in the rush to appropriation. For those of us schooled in the Girardian doctrine of "desire according to the other" and not according to the object, this idea that originary imitation might include imitation of the object along with imitation of the human other might rouse some initial resistance. Mimetic theory insists on the metaphysical nullity of conflict over the "object" only so as to permit us</page><page sequence="52">I40 Andrew Bartlett to rediscover its real physicality anew as transfigured by the rescue of corrupt human mimesis by divinely incarnate mimesis in the intervening Christ (from Whom, for Girard, all history devolves). If we examine Gans's slightly revised formulations patiently, however, we will see how they make the originary hypothesis more faithful to its "religious" roots in Girard's intuition. For the sign-alone-as-imitation-of-the-object reinvests the scenic event with violence against the object alone. The consequences of this minimal shift from the originary sign referring , to its also imitating, the object are no easy matter to convey. A contrast with the orthodox Girardian model of originary scapegoating might help. In Girarďs fundamental anthropology, the object of acquisitive mimesis (food) becomes the object of conflictual mimesis (all hominoids still fighting over food), but in the passage from conflictual mimesis at its worst- the madness of total mimetic indifferentiation- the object of attention that initially had an appeti- tive component (food) disappears, lost during the "madness" of the crisis of indifferentiation. The object reappears only after conflictual mimesis merges into reconciliatory mimesis, the founding event of collective murder, which wit- nesses the substitution for the food object of the first object of noninstinctual attention, the stunning cadaver of the human victim.115 Now in the newly mini- malized founding violence of Signs of Paradox, the equivalent of that moment of enigmatic loss, that moment of disappearance/reappearance, is a moment not of human murder but of the completion of the sign-as-imitation-of-the-object in its formal closure. This focus on the sign-imitating- the-object (not just imi- tating the sign of the human other) is the seeming heresy that will prove in the long run a turn of fidelity. I must quote Gans at some length here: Now . . . the sign does nothing but "point," not in anticipation of further [appropriative] action, but as re-presentation, calling to attention. The aim of the action now having shifted to communicating a representation of the object to the other, the beginning and end of this action, whatever feedback is available from the other, are ultimately determined by the internal or formal coherence of the gesture itself since it is this coherence that makes it an object of perception and thereby communicates to the other the intention to represent the object The formality of the gesture is an objective quality analogous to that of the forms of objects in the real world; the gesture as part of a sequence having its principle of coherence outside itself becomes an autonomous object of perception or Gestalt in itself. This alone is sufficient to speak of the sign as an imitation of its object."6</page><page sequence="53">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 141 Gans elaborates: "the sign does not intend its referent directly, but through mimesis of its formal closure/5 "The sign is an object, a product, a whole imitating another whole," "The sign is a form in that it turns back on itself in order not to appear to be pursued as a gesture of appropriation."117 What changes here is that the sign as a minimal representation of the real object of contention itself, like that object, becomes in its minimal degree an object of perception rather than one of esthetic apprehension. In Originary Thinking , the human advantage of the sign had been its provisional "drowning" of some measure of the resentment- resentment both against the central sacred object and against the equally deprived-resentful-desiring others on the periphery- experienced by the human subject as sign-user. The deferral of resentment was made possible by the "imaginary possession" that alternated in the imagination with the "recognized inviolability" of the center; oscillation of attention between sign-signifying- the-object and object- as-referred- to-by-the- sign created that deferral of resentment. The loaded resentment was only a hair's breadth away from the condition of fear. Indeed, it was dependent on the fearful intuition of "recognized inviolability" that confirmed the danger of the group's potential violence against any individual act of usurpatory posses- sion. In the Originary Thinking version of the event, therefore, the object itself was not fully "imitated" by the sign, in that the originary experience of the sign was not detachable from esthetic experience.118 But now a slight detach- ability is achieved in the intuition of the object as one of perception rather than esthetic apprehension: "we stand at the origin of form, which [form] we must explain without recourse to the notion of the esthetic." Previously, the theory had considered "the sign's detemporalization of the original appro- priative gesture" as "tantamount to [the sign's] constitution as form."119 Now, the sign's "very existence as form is a worldly realization of deferral," there emerges a new identity between mere nonesthetic "differentiation as marked by the sign and deferral of the mimetic conflict that the loss of difference risks bringing about."120 Because subject-rival and model-obstacle are still in the vicious mimetic fix of pragmatic dissatisfaction and latent violence, there is no loss of mimetic feedback. The plurality of group-shared esthetic mediation in circular form could easily, imperceptibly, be added to the originary sign. However, the minimal feedback is at first no longer mediated by the circularity that forces the originary significance of the sign itself either to be alienated from itself in a failed pointing to the object as utterly inimitable (sacred inac- cessibility) or to be divided within itself in the fissure between "imaginary pos- session" and "recognized inviolability" (esthetic oscillation). In short, with the deletion of circularity and return to triangularity, the "feedback loop" permits</page><page sequence="54">142 Andrew Bartlett a new intimacy of sign with object via the imitation of their shared aspect of "formal closure": A feedback loop connects the progress of the sign with the perception of its completion, something not required either in prehuman mimesis or in the performance of life-world routines. This [feedback] loop anticipates the oscillatory structure of the esthetic, but determines the specificity of the signing action as the creation of form-in-general rather than beautiful form. The sign is well-formed rather than beautiful; it does not call for a "second look" as does esthetic form. This first loop of formal judgment, in which the relation between sign and object is thematized so that we examine our sign and "see that it is good," is the minimal structure of human free will.121 To say that the sign is now not calling for a "second look" is another way of saying the sign does not depend for its internal coherence, its own "formal closure," on socially circulated esthetic experience. We might propose this: the sign that imitates is more self-subsistent than the sign that merely refers. The minimal signing act is intentional, willful, and formal; certainly, it depends on the other human mediator's perception of its own "formal closure" in the "imaginary scene of representation," so that with the sign, desire and resent- ment are born. There are consequences for the object-as-imitated-by-the-sign that we ought not to neglect. There is a new relation between the sign-as-imitation- of-the-object and the object-as-imitated-by-the-sign; note the connotations of "imitating" instead of "referring," which in themselves suggest a greater likeness. What follows is the intuition of an originary object at once more "concrete" and more "spiritual" (paradoxically) than the unstable, ephemeral object of circulating esthetic experience. This minimal object is closer in form to the object experienced as sacred (another aspect of the return to Girard). It is more "concrete" than the esthetic object, inasmuch as "perception" (minus human representation) belongs to the realm of animality where perceptibility of the raw cosmological object is all. As there is the hint of a new ontological independence of the sign as more complete "on its own," so is there a gain in the ontological weight of the cosmological object "on its own." Meanwhile, the object-as-imitated-by-the-sign is more "spiritual" than the esthetic object, in that its reality now more closely approximates that of the Divine second person of the Trinity, the Divine incarnate. We have access to this intuition if we notice that the sign-as-imitation-of-the-object has a wholeness in its formal</page><page sequence="55">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 143 closure that makes it, as sign, more closely anticipate the Word that was in the beginning. On the whole, this paradoxical doubled concreteness and spiritual radiance of the originary object-as-imitated-by-the-sign lends to the originary hypothesis a sharpened sense of the ostensivity of Girardian intuition. The sign-as-imitation-of-the-object is closer to the sign as the mediator of the expe- rience of the object as sacred. The sacred object always has been more "minimal" than the esthetic object. Gans has only apparently been unfaithful to Girard by heretically permitting the "object" to be a (nonhuman) object of imitation. For the minimal sign is more emphatically complete in its representing of the object as sacred alone. The minimal sacrality of the object may now be fully represented in the sign-as-the-imitation-of-the-object. Form-in-general is the form of minimal representation, the form of mimetic paradox detachable from esthetic oscil- lation. Form-in-general is the experience of the desire to "survive" the paradox of mimetic crisis, to defer one's appropriative aim. The pragmatic choice of the good no longer depends on esthetic judgment of the beautiful. It is coincidence, not accident, that Gans mentions human will, the arbiter of moral performance rather than esthetic judgment, in the context of this new formulation: "the relation between sign and object is thematized so that we examine our sign and ťsee that it is good,' [and that seeing] is the minimal structure of human free will."122 To choose the sign-as-imitation-of-the-object is to choose only the pure nonviolence of minimal hesitation in representation that lets the object- as-imitated-by-the-sign be , be as the sacred not-human other of the sign. To choose the-sign-as-imitation-of-the-object is less like choosing hesitation as a means of drowning subjectively felt resentment in esthetic oscillation. This minimal act of free will respects the object as the sacred object "imitated" by the sign, rather than as the esthetic object "held" fitfully in the usurpatory oscil- lations of the imagination: "Originary freedom is the mimesis of form."123 In other words, we imagine in the sign the object as completely significant in itself, not significant only as an object subjected to our (imaginary) resentment and desire. In its self-apparent externality and completeness, this sign is more like the Word and the object of its imitation more like the figurai incarnation of the Divine. Therefore, it anticipates more strongly the idea of God that will emerge in the remembered Being of the central locus after the violence of the sparagmos. The "return to Girard" in the return to triangularity turns out to be a return to the primacy of the sacred- the sign itself as the minimal representation of sacred Being and Incarnate form. I can now respect the promise that I made above to present a descriptive account of violence in the originary event. For starters, let us note that it has</page><page sequence="56">144 Andrew Bartlett always been the case for Gans that the object in the originary event is as much an object of violence as representation, as much a "victim" as a thing. Although Gans, unlike Girard, does not insist on placing in the center of the founding event a human victim of collective murder, he does place a "victim" of violence. In the fundamental form of human violence, which generative anthropology names the sparagmos , the central nonhuman object on the scene of linguistic representation "suffers" or is subjected to violence: it is torn apart, ripped to bits, defigured, disfigured, eaten, consumed, obliterated, all but forgotten. It persists in significant memory only as the figure and image of its form incar- nate as called forth to the community by the scene and the sign. The object of violence is remembered after being dismembered thanks only to such originary memory. The violence is of such an intensity that it must call forth those intu- itions of horror on which mimetic theory has drawn for some of its appeal. Gen- erative anthropology is not an irenic celebration of a blissful sphere of abstract representations. On the contrary, it argues that human representation converts animal appetite into human desire, infinite and apparently insatiable; represen- tation converts animal aggression into human violence, terrible and apparently intractable. Violence is violation of the sacred object. Animals have objects; they do not have sacred objects. "Violence" proper denotes only specifically human aggression-mediated-by-the-sign-imitating-the-object. The surplus of human violence is an effect only of the scenic structure of human representation and culture. According to the originary hypothesis, only seconds after the aborted gesture of appropriation in its first historical instance, the object would have fallen prey to something new in the universe: human violence. The ramifications in the material world of concrete objects of the knowledge produced by the sparagmos are all too obvious to us today when we look around our planet. The ecological triumph of our species forms a paradoxically self-intimidating tri- umph at one with the paradox of necessary evil in the sparagmos. The mystery is why human representation of the object should create uniquely human violence where once there had been only animal aggression against it. Signs of Paradox breaks slightly with the formulations of Originary Thinking in another detail, a break not unrelated to the one discussed above, in which originary form was no longer subordinate to esthetic form. Previously, Gans had posited a comparatively peaceful meal as the conclusion of the originary event. The sign having created some formal "hesitation" among the periph- eral performers of the aborted gesture of appropriation, the "hesitation" was understood to have had a calming effect on the group. This pacifying effect would have been extremely small, as small as the hesitation in the first abortive gesture of appropriation.124 Nonetheless, the pacifying effect of the sign is now</page><page sequence="57">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 145 minimalized. In Signs of Paradox, Gans drops the "wholly peaceful" from the description: "the division of the object need not be wholly peaceful so long as the violence it entails remains contained within the limits of the commu- nal order established by the originary sign."125 Notice that "communal order" already takes us beyond the minimality of the triangular formulation of the hypothesis. The two subjects in the triangle with their object of contention do not a community make. We will reconstruct a minimal triangular model of the sparagmos below. But what exactly are the "limits of . . . order established by the originary sign"? When exactly does the sparagmos happen? Why must it happen? It is absurd to ask, inasmuch as we are creatures who must eat. But let us insist, naively: why do we not at the origin continue to represent the object? Why can the sign not be prolonged indefinitely? This is another way of asking why the human is condemned never to be inhabited by the angelic spirit of nonviolence without ceasing to be an animal of flesh and blood. How can we formulate the paradoxi- cal necessity of the sparagmos , the inseparability of the sign-as-imitation-of-the- object from the object-as-imitated-by-the-sign in its generation of violence? Why must the object be destroyed with superadded aggression despite its neu- trality and seeming innocence as just the-object-as-imitated-by-the-sign? Why must we "harm" objects? If human uniqueness in representation is linked to human uniqueness in cruelty, as is demonstrated in (for example) the fact that we are the only animals on the planet capable of enjoying the esthetic experi- ence attached to rituals of torture, then the originary hypothesis should have something to say about the link. It is not coincidentally in the context of reflections on the historical per- secution of the first minority in the Holocaust, in a subsection titled "Mes- sianic Awaiting" in "The 'Jewish Question'" (chapter 11), that Gans offers some reflections relevant to these difficult questions. The context is a refinement of his contrast between the Mosaic revelation and the Christian revelation. Gans has made the suggestion that "[the] Passion demonstrates that the enunciation of the moral model of absolute reciprocity as an ethic sufficient for the con- duct of everyday life ... is destined to reanimate the originary resentment that led to the sparagmos."126 Lest we overhastily take this remark as a demotion of the Christian revelation, let us register its resemblance to Girard's interpreta- tion of Jesus's self-description as the one who brings not peace, but a sword. For Girard, the revelation of the "scapegoat mechanism" makes it more difficult , not less difficult for us to function peacefully in community. By depriving us of the cultural legitimation of the communal hatreds of ancestral enemies, the revelation of the scapegoat mechanism increases cultural indifferentiation and</page><page sequence="58">146 Andrew Barťlett sacrificial crisis. The revelation of the unjustifiability of violence against the Divine victim opens the way for revelations of the "innocence" of all human victims; but what is lost thereby in public group hatreds only spreads more contagiously in the form of individual privatized hatreds. Violence after Jesus is no less than earlier violence; it is only less explicit and more hidden, more ashamed of its failure to renounce violence. Individuals take their rivalries underground; the mass individualization and democratization of violence is by no means the reduction of violence. But let us appropriate Gans's reflections on the Passion so as to tease out the beginning of an answer to our question. When exactly does the originary sparagmos happen? Gans has implied that it was a model of "absolute [moral] recipro city" that animated the "originary resentment that led to the sparagmos." Adapting this to the originary triangle, we may assert that the absolute reciprocity of the two human subject-rivals and model-obstacles is that which animates the resentment expressed in the vio- lence done to the object. Gans continues: "making explicit the implicit moral configuration of the originary event undermines its original deferring effect."127 In the originary event, the "original deferring effect" (not an esthetic effect) is the slightest of hesitations, the minimal act of good will constitutive of the-sign-as-imitation- of-the-object and the-object-as-imitated-by-the-sign. The question is how to describe in the originary triangle the "making explicit" of the "implicit moral configuration." To answer requires a reconsideration of the asymmetry between the sign-as-imitation-of-the-object and the object-as-imitated-by-the-sign. It is the "formal closure" of the sign-as-imitation-of-the-object that makes explicit the implicit difference between the humans as sign-users and the object of vio- lence as non-sign. It is the formal closure of the sign that reveals the mimetic enemy-partners as morally alike, identical- morally about to do violence. When the differences between the two humans disappear, the symmetrical difference between them and the object reappears. That difference is the opening of the central figure to violence, the revelation of it as "vulnerable" to disfiguration. When does originary violence occur? In the next paragraph, Gans hypoth- esizes as follows: "At the origin, the sparagmos occurs once the sign has appropriated for its peripheral enunciators the formal closure of the central figure, so that it is no longer necessary for this closure to subsist in itself. As it comes to appear superfluous, the figure's figurality becomes vulnerable to the resentment it generates and open to the defiguration of the sparagmos."128 Sparagmatic defiguration is the tearing-to-pieces and obliteration of the object. We are on the cusp of originary violence. But this is a difficult passage. In what sense can we speak of it having been (prior to the sparagmos) "necessary" for the</page><page sequence="59">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 147 "formal closure" of the "central figure" to "subsist in itself? Now the central "figure" is not wholly identical in ontological terms to the central "object" as the thing of appetite, the cosmological raw material. Obviously, the object in its cosmological otherness as something "outside" the scene of human repre- sentation subsists in itself; it would be absurd to speak of the necessity of its material being ceasing. Rather, the central object-as-imitated-by-the-sign is the one already inside the context of transfiguring human representation. The "figure's figurality" thus refers to the object-as-imitated-by-the-originary-sign. But still, how are we to grasp the process of the "figure's figurality" somehow coming to "appear superfluous" to the subject-rival and the model-obstacle in the originary triangle of mimetic incompatibility? When would this superfluity of the central figure's figurality be reached? When would the necessity of the formal closure of the central figure to "subsist in itself' come to an end? The answer may be something like this: the originary intuition of the sign's self-completion in its formal closure as the-sign-imitating-the-object is one and the same as the originary intuition of its unreality as an inadequate mate- rial substitute for the object-as-imitated-by-the-sign. The instant of absolute moral reciprocity is the instant at which the subject-rival and model-obstacle are equally satisfied with the "formal closure" of their signs; in mutual media- tion, enemy partners having become one in their willed act of perception of the sign-as-form, they have equally understood the perfect similarity of each other's signs-as-imitations-of-the-object. Not just as signs referring, but as "imita- tions," each of the signs has "formal closure"; subject-rival and model-obstacle see the formal closure of both their own and the other's sign. This seeing of the signs alone with the object having dropped out of sight is the minimal model of the madness of originary cultural indifferentiation. However, this instant of the originary humans' perfect equality in attention to the formal closure of their signs alone is also the instant of their equality as two symmetrically opposed to the one central object, alike opposed to it both in its brute cosmological differ- ence (appetitive object) and its figurai otherness (significant object). The next instant will see the initiation of the horrific sparagmos , the violent animal ity that has been for an instant "forgotten" in the deferral enabled by the sign- imitation's formal closure. The now-initiated "amoral" horror of the return to animality against the object is proportionate to the now-complete "moral" purity of good will in sign-mediated hesitation shared by the humans symmetrically opposed to the object of violence. The instant of the sign's self-completion and formal coher- ence is itself the instant of the appear ing-superfluous of the figure's figurality. Only when the sign-as-imitation-of-the-object appears to be complete in itself as</page><page sequence="60">148 Andrew Bartlett a substitute for the object may we speak of the sign as having (in Gans's phrase above) "appropriated for its peripheral enunciators the formal closure of the central figure." It is as if the enunciators's intuitive sense of the perfection of the sign-as-imitation-of-the-object permits an originary minimal forgetting of the appetitive object; but appetite returns with a vengeance, now to compensate for the forgetting by means of violence. This originary forgetting we may take as the minimal model of the later forgetting of communal order threatened by the criminal private imaginary in real sparagmatic violence, the almost-forgetting in the individualized tearing-apart of the object.129 Let us continue into the somewhat surprising next paragraph of Gans's discussion, one of the more puzzling bits in Signs of Paradox. In it, the originary central figure is fancifully personified as an agent speaking to the participants in the first sparagmos. As has been our trick, we will reduce the circular "commu- nal" version to the triangular version of the event, so as to continue pursuing the new Girardian minimality in Signs of Paradox. Because the following passage calls forth the image of the crucified Christ (the Passion as mentioned above), it will eventually help us, as readers of Contaron well acquainted with Girardi privileging of Christian figurality, toward a grasp of all that is at stake in Gans's return to originary violence. The central figure, we recall, is the one that just prior to the sparagmos has become "vulnerable to the resentment it [as central figure itself] generates": But what this central figure "says" to the periphery in the originary event is the substance of what Jesus would articulate as morality: "You are all equal, because you all imitate me." This message of peace is in effect a call to war; the central figure affirms its difference from its peripheral imita- tors in the act of denying it. There is no escaping from this impasse any more than from any other variant of the foundational human paradox.130 Let us consider this passage first by following the hint and imagining without embarrassment, in the originary event, the food object represented and now about-to-be-violently-appropriated "speaking" to the two symmetrical humans at the other corners of the mimetic triangle. What would this central figure be "saying" to the two originary humans at the very instant of the self-completion in formal closure of their signs-as-imitations-of-the-object? Consider "You are all equal, because you all imitate me." We might transpose the address as fol- lows: "You are equal to one another , because you both imitate me." This transpo- sition reminds us of the mimetic paradox of incompatibility: both sign-users signify the desirability of the object; the sign-users increasingly intensify the</page><page sequence="61">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 149 desirability of the object in their very deployment of the sign; their desire for the object is equal, but equally impossible to be satisfied in each case. There is a perfect similarity of the two signs-as-imitations-of-the-object; the similar- ity of the signs matches the perfect similarity of the two humans using them. But here is the paradoxical necessity: that perfect moral equality of sign-action must generate the difference of the one (victimized) object-as-different-from- the-two-signs. The perfect similarity of the human sign users- their "explicit" consciousness of the formal coherence of the signs- must reveal the difference of the other object of violence- the "implicit moral configuration" of the poten- tial object-as-victim. Next, let us notice that Gans has asked us to imagine this spoken address as coming from the about-to-be-victimized central figure in "the act of deny- ing" its own central "difference from its peripheral imitators." But what is that difference from the peripheral imitators that is being "denied"? How can the object hidden by the central figure "deny" its difference from the sign? We must repeat the formulation from above: the instant of the sign's self-completion is itself the instant of the appearing-superfluous of the figure's figurality. Only when the sign-as-imitation-of-the-object appears to be complete in itself as a substi- tute for the object do the two originary humans "hear" the centrally figured food object speak "in the act of denying" its ontological difference from them, its "peripheral imitators." Why is it helpful to imagine the personified object-as- imitated-by-the-sign performing this act of denying? Because we can sense that in denying its otherness, it is trying to prolong the instant of its ^vulnerability. To imagine the object as figure "denying its difference" from the two humans incompatibly held at bay reveals its vulnerability. Only as long as the sign "lasts" does the vulnerable object exist; it is about to be torn to bits. The originary object of violence is "sacred" only for an ephemeral but "holy" instant of origi- nary human hesitation. The eternal instant of the origin of language, the origin of God, the origin of the human. But this exposure of vulnerability is only one flip of the paradoxical sides. For there is also the act of "affirm [ing] its difference from its peripheral imitators" that the central figure performs. As we saw above, the object-as- imitated-by-the-sign is most affirmatively different from the sign-as-imitated- by-the-object at the "formal closure" of the sign. In denying its represented difference, the food object says, "As object, I am no less and no more and none other than your sign-imitations of me." But humans have appetites; the sign must fail; therefore, this denial must be grasped as an affirmation of difference : "As object I am noty our sign-imitations of me: I am food, not the sign of food." This revelation of the food object as not-only-represented is the central figure's</page><page sequence="62">150 Andrew Bartlett "affirmation of its difference from its peripheral imitators." The revelation of the object's reality and the sign's insufficiency is generated by the sign's simul- taneous seeming sufficiency as substitute for real food. The seeming sufficiency of the sign is the appearing-superfluous of the figure's figurality; but the other- ness of the reality of the object as not-sign returns "with a vengeance": the object appears to affirm its difference. Animal appetite reasserts itself, but appetite is no longer itself alone: human desire, human resentment, they contain appetite in the surplus violence generated by representation. The discovery-invention of the sign along with its necessary inadequacy as a real food object is one with the discovery-invention of the real food object as now vulnerable to a supplement of aggressive energy. The central figure's affirmation of its difference from its peripheral imitators is the object's revelation of its "objective" difference from the inadequate sign. Perhaps inserting a quasi-cartoon version of this speaking central figure of the food object is not inappropriate. Let us imagine the moment at which the central figure says, "Do not eat me; eat your sign-imitations of me instead." That is the moment at which we originary humans recognize the impossibility of our obeying such an order- realize anew our hunger- and take our violent revenge on the object for having trapped us in such a paradox. (Nor does it change anything in the victimized object's favor that it gives us this command only in our imaginations- that, in reality, it has said nothing of the kind. Repre- sentation changes the real; it makes the real an object of real imagination.) More essentially, notice that "Do not eat me as the-object-imitated-by-your-signs" has presupposed that we are sufficiently conscious of our sign-imitations that we might think of eating them instead. There in the absurd eating of signs, imagin- able despite its absurdity, is the cartoon version of our originary intuition of the otherness of the real object as insufficiently represented by the originary sign, itself a material object but no substitute for the real thing. There is the absurdity of eating scrolls, kissing pictures, dancing with mannequins, praying to idols, and sticking pins in voodoo dolls. Meanwhile, the centrally figured food object saying "Do not eat me; eat your sign-imitations of me instead" certainly makes the "call to peace" that is in effect a "call to war," for the impossible command reveals the anthropological truth that we just know: our sign-imitations complete in their formal closure reveal their incompleteness as objects of appetite themselves. To become fully conscious of the sign as such is to become newly conscious of its object as other to the sign itself. The sparagmos of our willed defiance of the "do not eat me" command marks the primordial separation between word and thing, the fall from angelic representation into animal violence. But both the representation</page><page sequence="63">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 151 and violence now must be owned as human. We have no choice but to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because we have no other choice in becoming human. Let us get the meaning of eating knowledge: knowing, taking into ourselves the truth, that our representations, as good as they are in them- selves, are never good enough to eat. That is one truth all humans have known from the origin; we share that truth now with our earliest human ancestors who knew it then. There should be no shame in our needing to eat (we are only animals); but because we are the only animal who knows itself in the violence of eating- the only one that can intuit the violence of eating- there will always remain a little such shame (we are only human). "Do not eat me; eat your sign- imitations of me instead," says the food object. That we are able to represent the food object to one another and share it as represented even with these words on this page does not cancel our sense of the laughable inappropriateness of the imaginary food object's command. Such an imaginary food object is as unsatis- factory as it is completely imagined. The call to perfectly moral asceticism is the call to perfectly amoral satiation. The call to peace is a call to war. It is outra- geous that we should be asked to eat words, not things. We must eat objects, but in eating objects, we know that we are eating, having represented the food object to ourselves before taking it. Conversely, no human creatures necessarily subject to this founding paradox know their hunger more than those who have nothing to eat but words.131 After our hypothetical cartoon, it might seem impossible to reintegrate Jesus into our analysis, trying to make anthropological contact between the originary object-as-imitated-by-the-sign subject to violence and Jesus as his- torical and religious figure. But we might regain our bearings by remembering Gans's efforts to give the Christian revelation its full due in generative anthro- pology, particularly in Science and Faith but elsewhere as well. For Gans, there is no softening of the figurality of Jesus as the object of a universal human violence. On the contrary, we might say that originary thinking presents the figure of the Crucified as the anthropological idea of God Incarnate in the figure of the One object we must "have" in the sense of must "destroy in order to consume." All objects to which we do violence in our animal need to survive but toward which we feel a sacred debt of gratitude may be seen as types of the divine figure of Jesus as object of originary violence. The Crucified is the sacred object-victim incarnate in human form. Of all the object- victims of the evil necessity of violence done so that humans might survive as the unique spe- cies that represents and remembers the victims of its necessary evil, Jesus is the most memorable figure. His memorability and his victimization are one: he is remembered as the paradoxically Divine human victim. The global fame of</page><page sequence="64">152 Andrew Bartlett Jesus is itself evidence of the revelation of an anthropological truth. That fame is no accident; nor is it the product of the propaganda of televangelists or the Vatican. Nor is it another vestige of Western cultural imperialism. Jesus was and is the victim of a necessary evil. The victims of necessary evil are the most horrifying, for they are the ones for whom we cannot but own responsibility without smothering our intuition of the scene of representation. If we can imagine having done otherwise to a violently destroyed figure, then the violence we have done is not experienced as necessary; rather, it is experi- enced as a crime that we might not have committed and for which we might somehow make amends. The horror of the crucifixion, as of all necessary evil, is its seeming inseparability from scenic representation itself. The crucifixion seems as necessary as the violence done to the object in the originary events seems necessary.132 To begin to reflect on Jesus as figure of the originary object- as-victim already moves us a step toward grasping the continuity between "The Christian Revelation" in Science and Faith and Signs of Paradox, for the "necessity" of the crucifixion of Jesus is one with the hypocrisy of our wriggling attempts to believe that we can disown our responsibility for having crucified him. The formula "to know Jesus is to have participated in the crucifixion"133 can be assimilated to our intuition of a primal, not just metaphorical, responsibility for doing "violence" to objects. We might extend this even to the natural objects we consume, our responsibility for the necessary violence done to all objects of consumption as things disfigured and destroyed. To take one small step toward an originary anthropological theology of creation, we might suggest that it is in a reverent sense of primal mourning for the Divine Incarnate as the creator of the cosmos itself, as its First Incarnation, that we can grasp God as creator. Gratitude to God for having given us the "objects" we must necessarily con- sume in our quest to survive as human animals fits with our gratitude for the self-giving of the second Person of the Trinity. The second Person of the Trin- ity would be the universal Incarnation of such concrete, historical, real-world, flesh-and-blood self-giving.134 Let us return, however, to the puzzling "substance of what Jesus would articulate as morality: 'You are all equal to me, because you all imitate me.'"135 This is, Gans suggests, the "same" as that which the originary central figure, the central figure or object-as-imitated-by-the-sign, in the instant before the originary sparagmos , "says" to the two human subjects in the paradox of origi- nary mimesis. We may try to imagine what it is that Jesus is saying to them (and to us) at that impossible originary instant when the sign-as-imitated-by-the- object necessarily generates the violence done to the object-as-imitated-by-the- sign. The most cynically desacralizing translation would be to imagine Jesus</page><page sequence="65">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 153 (crucified or anticipating his crucifixion) saying something to this effect: "You are all equally hypocritical in trying to be martyrs as I am now; in your equally vain attempts to imitate me as exemplar of absolute pacifist nonviolence, you are all equally condemned to failure, for I was here on the cross first." Such a translation takes us to the limit of cynicism by making out of the historical Jesus a doubly disturbing figure. On the one hand, a fully self-conscious desire for the status of absolute martyr able to exclude all other humans henceforth from the possibility of meaningful acts of self-sacrifice, when and as such acts become historically necessary, would require the attribution to the historical Jesus of an overpowering egocentr icity. This is not to mention the massive evi- dence in the Gospels that would incline us against such a reading. At the same time, such an "I was here first" reading would make Jesus (ironically) believe himself not unique on the cross but equal as a competitor in a terrible competi- tion with potential human equals in historical victimization, an equality ("you are all equal, because you all imitate me") that is betrayed by his injunction to exclude others in advance from acts of self-sacrifice. In this implied competition for martyrdom, the translation casts Jesus as "just another martyr" like every other martyr-for-any-cause-whatsoever in human history, only a strange egotist for having decided to go there first. This cynical translation of Gans's enigmatic formulation must be rejected. It must be rejected not least because it presupposes that Jesus (and his imi- tators) desire more than anything to suffer on the cross. It contradicts (for example) the abundant evidence in the Gospels that Jesus loved life. But we do not require this historical appeal to the Gospel texts to justify our rejection; we can found our rejection on a fundamental anthropological intuition. Let us imagine Jesus as the originary object speaking to the two subjects of originary mimetic paradox: "Now that your signs have similarly completed their represen- tation of me, both of you are aware of your equality in having only your signs but not having me. Now come destroy me." In having to attribute to Jesus and to historical victims comparable to him a fundamental masochism ("now come destroy me"), to attribute to them a desire for violent death so gigantic that it is matched only by the intensity of their contempt for their own flesh-and-blood life-in-the-world, such a translation takes a perspective that is inhumane in its cynicism toward even the most misguided (spiritually proud) forms of human self-sacrifice. It is so cynical as to imply in its speaker an amorality that forgets what the sign does: the sign transfigures the object, simultaneously giving it more objective weight (out there) and deepening our internalized imaginative sympathy with it (in here). This translation does not give us confidence that we have heard the object speak. It is the type of cynicism that would reserve to itself</page><page sequence="66">154 Andrew Bartlett the "freedom" to hear in the cries of a victim of torture perhaps only a desire for more pain. We trust our originary intuition not to go there. Let us return and try again to look at the "substance of what Jesus would articulate as morality: ťYou are all equal to me, because you all imitate me."'136 We seek what the originary object of violence as the second Person of the Trinity there at the origin of the human "says" to the two human subjects caught in the paradox of originary mimesis. We seek what it is that God in the second Person of the Divine Incarnate (not in the first person of the Mosaic afigurai Other) is saying at the beginning to them (and to us) at that instant when the sign-as-imitated-by-the-object necessarily generates the violence done to the object-as-imitated-by-the-sign. Imagine the two originary humans in mimetic paradox "listening," to hear instead something like the following: "Your signs-as-imitations-of-me have generated within each of you a sacred centrality equivalent to my own as the-object-imitated-by-your-signs. You are now humans equal to one another as possessors of the sign, in the perfect sym- metry of your appetites, desires, resentments, and capacities. I am different: the object incarnate for which those signs can not substitute." This is what the central figure "says" at the instant of hesitation before the sparagmos , when the sign has completed itself. It is also what we might imagine Jesus as the Divine Object subject to human violence "saying" at the moment of the crucifixion. The figure says what we already know: that our signs do not suffice, and under the necessity of their difference from the object, the object will suffer. There is no way out of this originary human paradox of violence. But what we might call the humanization of the victim of violence at the heart of the Christian revelation speaks with the voice that says: "And so I give myself to you as the object of your originary violence; but never leave you as the divine Image of the One whom you have destroyed in order that you might become human." It is in this way that we need the Christian revelation if we wish to become fully human. Let us remember Saul on the road to Damascus, who heard the voice of God as Jesus only after having persecuted him. The revelation of Saul- his remembering having participated in the crucifixion- is the maximal model of the minimal "significant memory" of the originary sparagmos. The remembered image of the object incarnate, the image associated with the sign, is powerful enough to recall the whole scene of representation, the originary event. Jesus speaks to us in the voice of the originary object of violence as Jesus spoke to Saul. To know Jesus is to have torn apart the originary object of violence in its otherness at the origin. We as the performers of human violence must be neces- sarily different from the violated object, the originary victim. Now, after the</page><page sequence="67">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 155 sparagmos , now that we have human language for good and for ever, now we can "imitate" the originary object of our violence by naming it in grateful memory for its self-giving. The first Person of the Trinity says, "I am who I am." The second Person says something like this: "I am the originary object of human violence because I am the One whom you tore to pieces, unable to make peace among yourselves without destroying me. You lie to yourselves if you believe you did not wish to persecute me. It was impossible for you alone as users of language alone to make peace. You needed Me. For I am other than human sign: I am the Divine Object Incarnate. I come back to you now as the Word of forgiveness for that violence." Before we leave Signs of Paradox, we should reflect briefly nevertheless on the paradoxes of morality our analysis may have left implicit, for they too are part of what Gans is after in the enigmatic words "You are all equal to me, because you all imitate me." But a word of caution. It would be a great loss to celebrate René Girard as a Christian thinker while ignoring the Christian elements in the thinking of Eric Gans, one of Girard's most powerful students. Girard has been reticent about the political implications of his theory, while Gans has frequently been explicit about his own political opinions. One side effect of that difference might be the distorted impression that mimetic theory is "sensitive" to human violence, whereas generative anthropology in its explicit thematization of "necessary evil" is somehow less "sensitive." Any such pur- ported difference is illusory. In suggesting that Jesus as the divine Image of the object of originary human violence says, "You are all equal, because you all imitate me," Gans acknowledges the hard truth of the inimitability of the unique- ness of Jesus's moral perfection. The paradox of any exemplary human figure of pacifist self-righteousness- and our rejection of the "cynical" reading above showed that Jesus ought not to be mistaken for such a figure- consists in its guaranteed capacity to bring out the worst in the very "violent" people who are supposed to benefit from the example. Jesus himself, insofar as he is a type of the "pacifist" free of self-righteousness, represents that paradox: his goodness brought out the worst in those who crucified him. The intuitive test of the paradox is simple: ask yourself whether the morally perfect person does not arouse your resentment, for the very reason that he or she "reveals" your own moral imperfection to you. Would you rather be cast away on a desert island with a superlative saint or an average sinner? The human who denies being an average sinner is the one who denies his humanity, denies his ordinary desire for the vulnerable subjective centrality of the victim of necessary evil alone. By contrast, to wish to be a victim of unnecessary evil is to indulge a desire to present oneself in the victimary mode- one subject to fancied persecution</page><page sequence="68">156 Andrew Bartlett in a false imitation of Jesus crucified. Self-righteousness creates and courts unnecessary evil according to the paradox of pacifist exemplarity above. True righteousness is destroyed only by necessary evil, as the originary object-victim of the sparagmos was destroyed. The difference in Jesus's case is that his moral "perfection" is one with his forgiveness of our imperfections: the Jesus who reveals himself to Saul has already forgiven him (or he would not be revealing himself). But we can never forgive as Jesus does, for he is the figure of the object of our origjnary violence. Divine forgiveness is revealed in the same instant in which we receive the revelation of what we have done to him. To know Jesus is to have participated in the crucifixion; to be human is to have participated in violence against the originary object. But to know Jesus is also to know forgive- ness. The human is the species given to scenic representation; it is the species that does violence to creation, and so needs to be forgiven eternally for the violence done on its scene. This has been a rough reduction of the strain of "Christian" thinking in originary thinking. VI In between Signs of Paradox and the new publication that has occasioned this review essay, Eric Gans was certainly not silent, as anyone familiar with Anthro- poetics : The Journal of Generative Anthropology or with the Chronicles of Love and Resentment knows.137 But with The Scenic Imagination : Originary Thinking from Hohbes to the Present Day (2007), Gans has situated the originary hypothesis more explicitly than ever in the competitive market of modern philosophical and scientific reflections on the question of the origin of human language. Even a quick skimming of its pages reveals a feature that distinguishes it from all Gans's previous major books: the preponderance of block quotations. In no other volume does Gans engage in such explicit and patient dialogue with passages from so many other thinkers. It is as if generative anthropology has come down from its garret and now is out strolling the streets with an easy gait, rubbing shoulders with other anthropologies. Gans's writing has never been so conversational, so agreeably contextualized. Another aspect of the book's success as a research project consists simply in its impressive quasi-archival col- lecting labor: its discovery, retrieval, and narrative linking of the many block quotations, some of them baffling and others seeming only obliquely related to language origin- until originary analysis teases out their relevance. The reader gradually grasps that all these passages gathered together represent in</page><page sequence="69">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 157 fact a lively current in philosophical thought from Hobbes to contemporary biological anthropology: the current of speculative reflection on human lan- guage origins and human ontology. It might be called the tradition of originary thinking before Gans. Given this robust back-and-forth between exposition and commentary, The Scenic Imagination stands uniquely as the most direct and to- the-point elaboration of generative anthropology, at least inasmuch as it drops the originary hypothesis into the busy midst of its "competitors." Twenty- plus thinkers with whom Gans engages make case after case in which we can compare the originary hypothesis to its predecessors, anticipations, forebears, deniers, and competitors. Ironically, the book proves that after all and despite appearances, Gans has not been alone in the enterprise of originary thinking- regardless of how unfashionable such thinking has become in the last hundred years. The book's seeming directness may also be an effect of its never thinking about anything other than the question of the interplay between human ontol- ogy and human language. It is Gans's most explicitly "scientific" work. The Scenic Imagination declares itself to be the study of "the intellectual context within Western thought, beginning with the Enlightenment," in which a certain "error has been both accepted and challenged, although never before described."138 The error sometimes challenged, sometimes accepted is one of rejection: "It is a common mistake to reject the scenic imagination out of hand as Unscientific/ as though the scene could be reduced to a set of simpler neurological or genetic phenomena more amenable to scientific study."139 The human mind, soul, spirit, or realm of transcendence is worthy of our atten- tion and ought not to be expelled in servility to a materialist ontology; the scenic imagination should be respected. But what is "the scenic imagination"? Humans differ from animals because they represent sacred objects to each other in ritual, myth, narrative, art; these acts of representation give us a his- tory that animals do not have: "human experience, as opposed to that of other animals, is uniquely characterized by scenic events recalled both collectively and individually through representations , the most fundamental of which are the signs of language."140 The recalling of scenic events gives humans their history. Animals have memories; they remember events; they just don't remember histori- cal events. When we imagine sacred objects, we imagine them on scenes where we are peripheral actors and the objects are centers of attention, collective and individual; these objects and memories belong to and make up human history, a meaningful series of singular scenes of representation. One such object that can be represented on the scene of representation is the scene of representation itself: "The point of the term generative anthropology is that the scene of repre- sentation generates the meaning and structure that characterize the human.</page><page sequence="70">158 Andrew Bartlett Among the representations that can appear on the scene of representation is that of the generative scene itself. I shall call the faculty that carries out this self-representation of the scene the scenic imagination"141 Therefore, the scenic imagination is the human minďs activity of moving to imagine its own origin- to propose models of the scene on which the human mind, as creating symbols and created by the use of symbols, originated, as a unique event in the cosmos. It seems that the scenic imagination is mostly (not entirely) a secular thing: "Originary thinking is scenic: to think of human origin is to propose a hypothetical originary scene. Throughout human history, this has been done through sacred texts. In the period from Hobbes to Freud, it was often done through the exercise of the thinker's own scenic imagination."142 Before the Enlightenment, it was not thought needful to represent the scene of human origin to ourselves, inasmuch as religious texts and metaphysical presupposi- tions satisfied: "No more than the Bible did ancient metaphysics conceive the scene of representation as requiring a separate hypothesis of origin from that of the object-world to which its representations refer."143 Cosmology and anthropology were (more or less) one; the gods had not failed us, or at least not with failures sufficiently spectacular to embolden us to imagine the scenic self- generation of human being. The English Revolution and the collective murder of Charles I sufficed as a spectacular failure for Thomas Hobbes, who takes the first position in the study. The scenic imagination is the origin of modern, secular anthropology. It is, Gans notes in the context of describing the discovery that even the now conservative-seeming Hobbes made, an imagination that is "inherently liberal. If it is the human actors on the periphery who establish the center, then they have the power, and the right, to replace or even abolish it."144 The scenic imagination comes into its own alongside the flourishing of thought about "imaginary social contracts."145 It is no coincidence that such thinking was "incompatible" with the human ontology sustained by the "imperfect reciprocity of slave societies, what we might call those societies' implicit violence/"146 This remark is continuous with the implications of the discussions of the origin of social differentiation in The End of Culture, the "negative revelation" in Science and Faith , and the closed center of the classical esthetic in Originary Thinking. A social structure accepting of slave inequality is not one conducive to having its participants imagine the originary equality of all human beings as users of language, as "free" makers of the social world. Without the radical egalitarian moral theology of Christianity, we would never have gotten ourselves into the place where the scenic imagination was possible. We began to think about the specifically human origin of social institutions when the fragility, instability, and vulnerability to desacralization of</page><page sequence="71">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 159 such institutions was welded to hypotheses exploiting our intuition of the power of linguistic reciprocity as a model of political reciprocity. Hobbes, Gans men- tions, is deservedly considered by some to be the first modern philosopher of language. The "thinker's own scenic imagination"147- from Hobbes to Freud and beyond- must to some degree struggle against the potentially mind-numbing effect of the power of "sacred texts" alone, conceived as centers before which one must subsist in mute awe rather than centers that one might usurp (in fear and trembling). Part i is titled "Scenes of Enlightenment." Hobbes, Locke, and Condillac are treated together; Rousseau and Kant each get their own chapter; between them, passages in Vico and Herder are analyzed as foundational of "alternative anthropologies." The chapters on Rousseau and on the aesthetic anthropology of Kant are the most detailed, dense, and difficult in the book; they are also the most brilliant. Gans has selected these seven figures as representative of the Enlightenment. He affirms that Hobbes and Rousseau agree that "the central human problem is the violence caused by mimetic desire";148 "Both understood that neither scarcity nor even inequality but the contatori of desire poses the most serious problem to human society; and both made the ability to hold this desire in check the sine qua non of a viable polity."149 Locke is praised as "the primary theorizer of history's most successful model of large-scale human interaction,"150 the liberal-democratic free market. Condillac, whom Gans cred- its with a "groundbreaking contribution," is celebrated for "situating [the ori- gin of human language] specifically in the passage from the natural-indexical sign of need to its 'arbitrary' linguistic counterpart" and thereby focusing "our attention on the possible motivations for this passage"151 from the indexical sign to the arbitrary symbol. The originary romantic Rousseau, unlike the vast majority of social scientists even in our time, "is aware that language cannot be explained as a simple prolongation of pre-human systems of communica- tion."152 Rousseau grasped the paradox of originary representation: "if men need language in order to think, they must have needed thought in order to speak."153 Gans is enthusiastic about the scenic intuitions of Vico: "We make ourselves human by discovering/inventing a transcendent world of signs that is inaccessible to human control. Vico comes closer to anticipating this radically anthropological conception of sacred significance that any other thinker before the postmodern era."154 Meanwhile, Gans is not now, as he has never been (and our analyses of his previous works demonstrate), a purely "secular" thinker, if "secular" means con- temptuous of religion, inclined toward revolutionary atheism, and confident in the salvific powers of human reason alone, unaided by revelation. Gans's</page><page sequence="72">i6o Andrew Bartlett unwavering respect for the "spiritual" or transcendent dimension of human mindfulness and his unashamed owning of the mystery of human being coin- cide with the anthropological theology he proposes. As we have seen, there is an important sense in which the originary hypothesis argues that the human originated only by naming God as its sacred Other. It is no surprise that The Scenic Imagination argues that the Enlightenment, a project in anti-religious desacralization, was bound to exhaust itself in a certain set of failures, with the exhaustion exhibited most spectacularly in the embarrassing (to "Reason") devastations of the French Revolution. While the "scenic imagination of the Enlightenment" merits praise in that it "constructs an anthropological genesis for the ancients' timeless conceptions of the social order,"155 the models of the originary scene proposed by Enlighten- ment thinkers remain "on the political level, [the level] of the public interaction of represented desires."156 This fits with the concurrent domination of the neo- classical esthetic, in which the figures of desirable centrality remain bound to the public scene. Gans observes the effect of the Enlightenment social contract thinker's preoccupation with the origin of political institutions in this way: "It is no accident that the model of the genesis of the center from the periphery that flourished in the Enlightenment was epitomized in the social contract, generative of state-level political institutions rather than of the human itself"157 The problem for the social contract model of human origins in political self-genesis is that, over and over again, scenes of the origin of human society presuppose the already-established presence of the language-using humans themselves who are about to enter society. The originary coèvality of the sign and human social- ity as sociality mediated by representation has not yet been grasped. For the social contract thinker who takes the sign for granted, humans somehow got to be there without the eventfulness of punctual mimetic paradox. Thus the major figures of the Enlightenment "could conceive the deferral of human violence as the source of human institutions, but not of the human itself."158 The function of the originary ostensive sign both designating the sacred center and defer- ring intraspecific communal violence by naming the transcendent Other could never quite be grasped. The erroneous tendency in the repeated Enlightenment failures to achieve takeoff in the long series of approaches-without-success to originary thinking derives also from the reliance of its epistemology on the model of a collection of atomistic individuals coming together: "the Enlightenment's scenic imagina- tion . . . conceives the individual as a consumer whose desires are fixed before he enters the marketplace rather than emerging dynamically from within the activity of exchange."159 In failing to conceive the "common and interdependent</page><page sequence="73">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 161 origin"160 of the collective and the individual in an event where the human is born in significant difference from its one sacred Other- an event whose envi- sioning religion had always preserved- Enlightenment thinking suffers from a "characteristic failure to consider that the minimal human group must first solve the problem of deferring internal mimetic conflict before it can enter into an external 'state of war* with other groups or individuals such as would neces- sitate the establishment of state sovereignty over the means of violence."161 This "characteristic failure" is no minor glitch. It goes to the limit of Enlightenment wisdom, the vanity of proposing models of social authority independent of respect for the originary sacred that permitted linguistic transcendence itself: "Whether for Hobbes or for Rousseau, the center is a focal point of human desire, not a locus of transcendence; the central authority is not, as it would be for Durkheim, equated with the sacred."162 The merely political center of the social contract cannot be the sacred center of the originary event (the originary hypothesis). Gans is not a "social contract" thinker. Thus in "Ending the Enlightenment," which opens part 2 of the book, "The Scene Embodied," Joseph de Maistre is credited for maintaining "his focus on what the Enlightenment had ignored: the sacred generative center of all human society, to which we characteristically relate through sacrifice ."l63 Origi- nary thinking remains linked to its roots in Girarďs discoveries. The center must be intuited not merely as a locus on which all the desires of atomistic individuals might converge in unanimous chaos, but also as a locus conceived as the space on which the being of the sacred Other of the human subsists: "his [de Maistre's] focus on blood sacrifice as apotropaic violence provides a better-articulated model of how the sacred functions in human society than Durkheim's vague notion of ritual as reinforcing communal solidarity."164 Similarly, in the same chapter, Edmund Burke with his foundational critique of revolutionary violence is praised for having rejected the scenic imagination of the Enlightenment "because that scene itself is presented as simply renewable (as a 'social contract') without reference to its origin, as though the propositions of philosophy were not themselves dependent on a prior founding of the scene of representation at a moment previous to the existence of the 'context-free' declarative- that is, at a moment whose nature as event could not be abstracted from it."165 In other words, religious thought as opposed to the metaphysical thought that permits the enthronement of a supposedly paradox-free "Reason," however apparently "naïve" its figurations of an anthropomorphic Creator, was correct to situate the origin of human history in relation to a transcendent Other. Burke was therefore quite right to champion the intuition that we must have one unique human origin if we are to speak of history as a series of events</page><page sequence="74">i62 Andrew Bartlett with a transcendent dimension. The Burke-defended originary "moment whose nature as event could not be abstracted from [the moment]" is, in this sense, a theistic moment. To this day, revolutionary atheism (that of the prophets of artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, neurological self-fashioning, and the like) dreams of remaking humans into beings who owe no reference and trace no history to that humbling minimal event- humbling because we can not be without our transcendent Other. Part 2 of The Scenic Imagination , "The Scene Embodied," moves a little more quickly through a longer list of figures. After Burke and de Maistre, the chapter "Scenes of Philosophy" is devoted to Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche. "Scenes of Human Science" considers Wilhelm von Humboldt, Max Muller, J. F. McLen- nan, and Lewis Morgan; Durkheim, Freud, and Girard; and the excessively influential Franz Boas. The same painstaking and respectful probing continues, by means of which Gans touches on high points of credit for sound originary intuition and respectfully notices and respectfully analyzes the historical obsta- cles to its pursuit, the beliefs and presumptions that stood in each thinker's way. Hegel in his master-and-slave dialectic gets beyond the political scene of the social contract: "For the first time, the human self, and not merely a human polity, is conceived as generated through scenic interaction, the outcome of which is economic"166 Durkheim is recognized as "the first thinker to conceive of the sacred as a mode of interaction among human beings rather than as the expression of either their awe before the spectacle of nature or their commu- nion with gods or 'spirits.'"167 Freud is "the first thinker to construct a genuine collective scene of human origin."168 On the other hand, some less praiseworthy Enlightenment tendencies persist even to this day, especially the slippage that permits the smuggling in as préexistent of that human language the very ori- gin of which is supposedly being explained. For example, in the case of Hegel, Gans writes: "The operative concept of dialectic depends on the transcendental from the very start; which is to say that, like Plato's Ideas, it [the concept of dialectic] is implicitly dependent on human language."169 Similarly, Nietzsche's subtle cancelation of the center-periphery tension permits him to estheticize the scene of representation at the expense of its ethical functionality: "Thus the central figure who emerges from within the chorus of satyrs is already transcen- dent; the single actor playing the role of the god is not opposed agonistically to the others, but merely incarnates their Vision.' Neitzsche's scene eliminates the constitutive tension between sacred center and human periphery."170 When Nietzsche went so far as to present "the scenic [itself] as the transcendence of the ethical, 'beyond good and evil,"'171 he opened the way to an estheticization of politics that had, as we know, terrible real-world consequences. It is perhaps</page><page sequence="75">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 163 to be expected that Karl Marx, the most dogmatically materialist of the three "philosophers" discussed in chapter 7, produced the anthropology most readily exposed as one of "fundamental incoherence."172 A materialist ontology that reduces human signs to "just" another form of "matter" will always be radically incompatible with the human ontology proposed by generative anthropology, which is unashamed to let the world of representations be a part of the "real" world in which humans live and move and have their not-just-material being. The influence in America of Franz Boas is decisive in establishing the suspi- cion toward originary thinking as "incompatible with human diversity"173 and, in the long run, vulnerable to the accusation of being "politically incorrect" in its universalist aims. Nonetheless, Gans does not shy away from describing the philosophical poverty of Boas's obstinate empiricism: "Boas has no theory of the human scene; he not only does not but cannot propose a theory of human origin because he will not and cannot tell us what the human is. Boas's discus- sions of religion, language, and art simply take these institutions as empirically given."174 Here, the "slippage" noted above extends from the origin of language to the human itself. For Boas and his myriad disciples, everything human (rites, myths, artworks, monuments, histories, religions) is already given, not just human language. Boas is as far away from philosophical anthropology as one can get. Let us just fill up the academic sack with files of ethnographic data. We are free to set aside with uplifted chins the impertinent question of a tenable hypothesis about what the human is and by what event the human came to be in cosmological history. We may safely assume that we just, well . . . evolved. Toward the end of The Scenic Imagination, Gans takes stock of the way in which hopeful indications of some openings toward originary thinking about the human have come in recent decades neither from the humanities nor the human sciences (evidence of a sorry dereliction of duty), but (rather ironically) from the field of evolutionary biology as it intersects with the anthropology of human origins. In the conclusion, Gans engages first in discussion of important work by Roy Rappaport, Merlin Donald, Manfred Bierswich, and Derek Bick- erton. In the context of his critique of Rappaport, Gans returns again to the essential function of the sacred in creating human difference that Burke and de Maistre had appreciated: "Human ritual, mediated by language, is not simply more 'complex' than animal ritual; unlike the partial networks of animal rela- tions, it is structured around a sacred center. All the unique characteristics of the human are attributable to this one difference, yet one seeks in vain through- out Rappaporťs long book a clear formulation of it."175 Merlin Donald seems oblivious to the most basic insights of the work of René Girard and deprived of the intuitions of Hobbes and Rousseau, demonstrating a "profound failure</page><page sequence="76">i64 Andrew Bartlett to recognize the inherently conflictive structure of mimesis."176 The slippage we noted above reappears in the work of Bickerton. Likewise, what Gans says of Bickerton could be said of dozens of evolutionary anthropologists's scenarios of language origin, obsessed with adaptive advantage and fitness and the like but failing to grasp the transcendental effect of the human sign: "the main difficulty of deriving human language from its practical application [is] . . . that it can have no practical application until it already exists."177 One can only wonder at the attractiveness-despite-futility of the many, many "attempts to find in the obvious usefulness of language the explanation of its emergence."178 Ultimately, however, trusting in the model of the exchange of ideas, Gans finds encouraging convergences between the originary hypothesis and the research in David Sloan Wilson's Darwin's Cathedral (2002) and Terrence Deacon's The Symbolic Species: The Co-Evolution of Language and the Brain (199 7). Deacon in particular is credited with the "rare distinction of understanding that the original function of language is ethical, that the crucial ethical problem is 'to mediate . . . peace/ and that the meanings of language are social realities not reducible to any individual's brain state."179 The Scenic Imagination may be especially interesting to those interested in the history of political theory as it intersects with philosophical anthropology. The similarities between the radical new thinking of Gans and Girard, as this book's thematization of the centrality of the sacred in human ontology makes quite clear, continue to outweigh the differences. It has been one goal of this long review essay to encourage those who read Girard to take a greater interest in reading Gans, starting with the volume that they find most intriguing. Keeping these two thinkers, René Girard and Eric Gans, in proximity should be the business of everybody who wishes to promote fundamental reflection on the human founded on a shared intuition. It is the intuition that the mimetic violence at the origin of the human is imperfectly contained by human repre- sentation alone; representation is always inadequate in its attempts to contain the difference between the human and its sacred Other. But such is the best we can do. In the beginning was the Word, and without that still small word we would be nowhere. We would certainly not be here now in one another's company, having taken this tour through these ideas with Eric Gans, having touched on these texts that are valuable to read and to study and to take into the human future.</page><page sequence="77">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 165 NOTES §V is a variation on a paper I presented at G ASC 2008 at Chapman University, June 26-27, 2008, which appeared in "The Object of Originary Violence and the Second Person of the Trinity" in Anthropoetics 14, no. 2 (2009).

Compare the following: "The apologists for 'metaphoric' religion would have us believe that religion consists of some excellent moral beliefs with a gratuitous supernatural element thrown in. . . . Yet it is not the attachment to supernatural beings but to historical particularity that differentiates religious faith from scientific hypothesis" (120). 25. Gans, Science and Faith , 109. 26.

This formulation is smuggled in from a later refinement of Gans's thinking on these issues. See "The Anthropological Idea of God," in Eric Gans, Originary Thinking: Ele- ments of Generative Anthropology (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1993), 31-44. 36. Note that "whether" is excluded from the hyphenated list of embedding relative pro- nouns. "Whether" does not subordinate and relativize the joined clauses so much as threaten the alternative nonexistence of one clause by the other; "whether" would trap us in the metaphysical prison of propositional thought, taking away in ostensivity what it can never deliver in verifiability. There is a curious appropriateness in the constitutive redundancy of the "or not" that often completes a "whether" construction. 37. Gans, Science and Faith, 65. 38. Gans, Science and Faith, 26. Compare the following: "History is made by revelations that men have chosen to retain in preference to others, for never altogether sufficient rea- sons, and that they can always choose at some future date to reject" (68). And this: "For the worldly success of a revelation, however great, can never be adequate to its truth, which can never be the object of a rational choice, but only of faith" (78). 39.

Meanwhile, looking ahead, the content of chapter 5 in Originary Thinking, "The Origin of Fiction," anticipates many of the ideas developed more sharply in the chapter "The Two Varieties of Truth" in Gans's next work, Signs of Paradox, published in 1997. Studying these segments together leads to fascination with the interplay between the excitement of discovering ideas and the confirmatory exhilaration that comes with experiencing the flexible openness to refinement through intuitive testing of these ideas. 50.

The originary hypothesis claims that language must have originated in an event that occurred in a specific place and at a specific time; in its punctualism, the hypothesis conforms to this claim about sacred experience. The origin of language itself is a "sacred event" of sorts, the minimal sacred event. The experience of the exchange of signs is the minimal form of the experience of the sacred; but as with all sacred "objects," the revelation of the form of that experience must be rooted in a particular event and place (even though we will obviously never find the archaeological site for this event, which is one reason why it must remain the object of a hypothesis). 55.

By the way, this substitution of the identifiably human nonappetitive object (last) for the nonhuman appetitive object of consumption (first), one type of object "disappear- ing" but a quite different type "reappearing," plays the trickster role of foundational enigma in the Girardian originary event. At least, we must concede that it does so, unless mimetic theory rests content with risking the impression of a unity of collec- tive murder and cannibalism as the origin of the human. Such a unity is not Girard's explicitly declared intention, to the best of my knowledge. 116. Gans, Signs of Paradox, 28-29 (emphasis added, except for it, which is italicized by Gans). 117. Gans, Signs of Paradox, 30. 118. Gans, Originary Thinking, 117-20. For example: "Thus the first sign could not simply have been judged to refer to its object; it must have been judged to be beautiful" (119). But now in Signs of Paradox, the notion of the-sign-as-imitation-of-the-object does aim to capture that form of reference that does not require the judgment that it is beautiful. Or again: "The subject engaged in the paradoxical oscillation of the esthetic experience cannot grasp in a single imaginary moment, or 'image,' either the sign as accessible re-presentation or the central object as inaccessible referent" (118). But now in Signs of Paradox, the notion of the formal closure of the sign-as-imitation-of-the-object does suggest its users' ability to grasp, for however minimal an instant, the sign itself as "accessible re-presentation." 119.

For example: "In the sparagmos, the sign, as the expres- sion of renunciation, is 'forgotten'; with the destruction of its original referent, it passes out of consciousness into the unconscious of collective mediation wherein its guarantee resides. The forgetting of the sign defers the moral model with respect to which the participants in the sparagmos would be condemned for their act" (151). I am suggesting a model for the first minimal instant of this forgetting, the instant that itself initiates the sparagmos in the "revelation" of the paradoxical incompatibility of sign-as-imitation-of-the-object and object-as-imitation-of-the-sign. 130. Gans, Signs of Paradox, 155. 131. We might continue with the polemical point that for originary thinking the real "vic- tim" is always another human victim, a human being deprived of objects altogether, not the objects consumed. The planet earth never has been and never will be our "victim," except by analogy with the violence done to humans by humans- including the vio- lence of depriving others of food. The sooner environmental thinking grasps this, the sooner its politics will become anthropologically appealing rather than pantheistically counterintuitive. It is not terribly helpful to aim toward maximizing human shame over consumption as such. We as humans on the scene of representation have con- sumed objects from the beginning (the same ones we have represented, as we learned to represent them). It is mostly in the privileged West that the privileges of consumption are despised as wrong (not without a certain hypocrisy, one might add). Originary think- ing would submit the notion that we become conscious of "nature" not by stopping our consumption of it but by becoming conscious of consumption itself. Conscious- ness of "nature" in itself grows only in proportion to consciousness of human Consumption of nature. 132. The horror of the Holocaust (for example) is different: we would not wish to categorize it as a necessary evil in that we would wish to "learn" from it never to let it happen again. The uniqueness of its horror derives from the fact that the Nazis tried to remove this sacrificial violence to a place outside of representation as historical commemora- tion: "The horror of the camps is their scenelessness; for the first time in history, a central policy of violence is deliberately excluded from the scenic structure of culture"; "Thus, what makes the Holocaust exemplary of a newly radical category of evil is not the multiplicity of its victims, but their lack of esthetic exemplarity. The victim of the sparagmos is a figure; the victims of the Holocaust were chiffres, abstractions" (Gans, Signs of Paradox, 164). But inasmuch as the crucifixion is by definition something that could have happened only once, it does not make sense to speak of it as something we wish not to happen again. The crucifixion is the figure of a violence that we must have done in the first place but from which we can learn only that it was we who did it (and we can learn that only after the fact): that is why it so closely resembles, and evokes, originary violence against the object. By contrast, if there is anything to be "learned" from the Holocaust, then perhaps it would be the value of an attitude toward it based</page><page sequence="83">From First Hesitation to Scenic Imagination 171 on a somewhat similar knowledge: it was we who sent the victims to the camps, not the evil Nazis from whom we (smugly?) differ. The more we mechanically blame the Nazis from whom we trust we differ, the less prepared we are to grow in consciousness of our own potential for evil. Meanwhile, the Jewish person is one who does not have to ask himself the questions on the Holocaust that the "Christian" person is bound by necessity to ask and try to answer. 133. "But the primal experience of Being is that of mourning; the mystical intuition of an ineffable essence recalls the loss of its originary incarnation. The central figure that originally attracted the group's appetites has been de-figured by those who henceforth depend on it all the more as their cultural model." Gans, Signs of Paradox, 143. 134.

Anthropoetics: The Journal of Generative Anthropology has been published biannually (a spring/summer and a fall/winter issue) since 1995. Now in its 13th year, with Eric Gans as chief editor, the journal is a treasure-mine for anybody wishing to pursue generative anthropology. Meanwhile, also since 1995, Eric Gans has been delighting readers with the often topical and more informal mini-essays, Chronicles of Love and Resentment . As of the time of writing, Gans has written 369 Chronicles . The Chronicles, too, are an invalu- able resource for the student of generative anthropology. 137. Gans, Science and Faith, 87. 138.
