<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROBERT P. NEWTON University of North Carolina, Greensboro "Destiny" and Hesse's Demian 1. Nun sollte ein Krieg kommen. Nun sollte das zu geschehen beginnen, was wir oft und oft geredet hatten. Und Demian hatte so viel davon vorausgewuf3t. Wie seltsam, dab jetzt der Strom der Welt nicht mehr irgendwo an uns vorbeilau- fen sollte-, dal3 er jetzt pl6tzlich mitten durch unsere Herzen ging, daB Abenteuer und wilde Schicksale uns rie- fen und dab jetzt oder bald der Augenblick da war, wo die Welt uns brauchte, wo sie sich verwandeln wollte. Demian hatte recht, sentimental war das nicht zu nehmen. Merk- wiirdig war nur, dal3 ich die so einsame Angelegenheit 'Schicksal' mit so vielen, mit der ganzen Welt erleben sollte. Gut denn! (Hesse, GD, III, 252) Thus Emil Sinclair braces himself for the First World War in Hermann Hesse's novel Demian. But Sinclair is right; it does indeed seem strange that his personal fate is suddenly to be shared even with the bourgeois "herd" which is otherwise disdained by Sinclair and Demian (and Hesse), for we had previously learned that "Wer wirklich gar nichts will als sein Schicksal, der hat nicht seinesgleichen mehr, der steht allein und hat nur den kalten Weltenraum um sich" (GD, III, 222). One's destiny is inexorably one's own, "nicht ein beliebiges, " and one must "es in sich ausleben, ganz und ungebrochen" (GD, III, 221). On the other hand, destiny seems to come from outside; we are its agents, without responsibility: "Alle Menschen, die auf den Gang der Menschheit gewirkt haben, alle ohne Unterschied waren nur darum ffihig und wirksam, weil sie schicksalbereit waren. Das pa8t auf Moses und Buddha, es paBt auf Napoleon und Bismarck. Welcher Welle einer dient, von welchem Pol aus er regiert wird, das liegt nicht in seiner Wahl" (GD, III, 239). Our crowded, inscrutable wordly destiny (our lot) leaves us no choice but compliance, and yet we seem free and even 519</page><page sequence="2">520 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Fall 1985 obliged to "want" our lonely inner destiny (our true self), while in the war both paradoxically become the same. Not only in Demian, but also in other writings of Hesse in this period one encounters an apparently tangled confusion of concepts with regard to "destiny." Yet, especially if Demian is to be read as a guide for the youthful in their search for a self, or for any age in the throes of a pressing identity crisis (and the book was incubated by Hesse's own midlife crisis); if "self' and "fate" (or "destiny") are clearly related for Hesse-then it is certainly important to examine these vital ideas as such and trace out their full implications, both personal and social. Ernst Cassirer has spoken of the return of fatalism in the modern world (293), a remark prompted by observing modes of thought, such as that in Os- wald Spengler's Decline of the West (1918-22), which were contemporary with Hesse. And our own age has still to deal with various unresolved claims of deterministic world-views, be they dialectical materialism or Biblical eschatol- ogy, be they behaviorism, ethology or other studies of the acquired or given fatalities of man. All of these, as does "destiny" in Demian, bear of course on our views of the causes and "meaning" of human events such as wars, as well as on our private ethical decisiveness and impetus to productive activity. The force of Schicksal ("fate" or "destiny") appears in Hesse's work long before Demian, but only in the latter novel is it centrally thematized and infused with symbolic power. Though Hesse's fate-motif would seem to be an obvious one, it is usually overridden in critical study by a fascination with Hesse's Jungian symbolism or Oriental sources.' Joseph Mileck identifies Frau Eva in Demian with self, life in all its fullness, heaven and earth, good and evil, the Magna Mater and mankind's origin and destiny (94). To be sure, Hesse was inspired by Jung's anima and other archetypes, and many of Mileck's equations derive from the novel, but if they are to prove enlighten- ing insights we must try to determine what Hesse himself was thinking in saying "good and evil," "self' and "destiny." Indeed, according to Jeffrey L. Sammons, "what is really needed to get to the bottom of Hesse generally is an analysis of his language" (350). In its own day, Demian was by no means received as a recondite finger- exercise in literary symbolism. Many observers thought it reflected the urges and frustrations of an important sector of postwar youth in 1919. Thomas Mann has described its "electrifying effect" and compared it to that famous earlier Weltanschauungs-success, Goethe's Werther (Unseld, 61-63). Alfred D6blin, Stefan Zweig, Jung himself, Ernst Robert Curtius, Martin Buber and others have recorded their vivid impressions (59, 61, 63-64)." To contemporary Germans, and not only the very young, it was a cathartic revelation, an exhilarating thrust toward self-liberation from conventional shackles. Yet- from our own perspective - we can ask if it might also have reinforced social and political penchants whose results were far from liber- ating. It was Hesse's call to self-commitment; but, looking backward, we can</page><page sequence="3">NEWTON: Hesse's Demian 521 see that it may have also encouraged an elite political actionism, the dynamic self-righteousness of groups "at the service" of destiny but without a con- crete program of action. Demian insists that we must not repress our truest nature, to whatever suffering that may lead. But this could have spoken to the "Germanic" spirit of actively accepting one's fate, even one's doom. Too, the novel's thematic Schicksal probably coincided with popular metaphysical interpretations of the Great War as a movement of the World Spirit, Weltge- schichte als Weltgericht (Vondung, 62-84). Finally, this faith in destiny may have deterred a discovery of self through purposeful activity in the practical and social world, the path long ago pointed out by Goethe, strangely enough one of Hesse's Immortals. These are questions of not only historical interest. 2. The semantic fields of fate, destiny, providence, doom, or Schicksal, Ge- schick, Vorsehung, Verhiingnis consists of weighty words with long cultural traditions. Hesse cannot invoke Schicksal without calling forth potent re- sponses, as was his obvious intent. In English, destiny seems to be the most general word for the power that controls events in an individual life or in history, or for the course of those events themselves. It may particularly refer to one's station or walk or mission in life and is sometimes thought of as not incompatible with a degree of freedom in the execution of its decrees. Fate implies a more inexorable determination, whose outcome is often unwelcome or at least unwilled. One wouldn't say, "it was his fate to be rich," unless, like Croesus, the rich man suffered as a direct result. But we might well say, with a touch of self-satis- faction, "it was my destiny to be rich." One's lot is one's given share of the world's goods and tasks. Doom is irrevocable and fatal; fortune is often good to us, sometimes awarded by chance, but also a prize to be struggled for. The German Schicksal is the power which predetermines events and those events themselves, not always unfavorable (though usually so), but emphat- ically solemn and binding. It is important to note that Schicksal incorporates both English fate and destiny, so that the occasional hopefully heroic ring of English "destiny" is not so readily available in German. Geschick is less weighty than Schicksal and may imply the general cir- cumstances of one's life; it is even subject to manipulation. Verhangnis is as dreadful a judgment as doom, while Gliick is a favorable turn of events like good fortune. Vorsehung (providence), Sendung (mission), and Berufung (call) are originally Christian notions; Bestimmung (task) and Los (lot, often accepted with resignation) derive from a more diffuse metaphysical basis. Schickung and Fiugung are blows or acts of fate, the latter often fortunate for those concerned. Hesse uses Verhdingnis and Los only incidentally in Demian; words like Vorsehung and Bestimmung he makes use of elsewhere, foregoing the hard, brazen tone of Schicksal.</page><page sequence="4">522 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Fall 1985 The figures of speech proliferating around German Schicksal personalize it as a human power. They speak of the grace (Gunst) of destiny, the hand of fate, an irony of fate; say that fate willed it so, that fate meant him well, that he challenged fate or quarreled with it. Fate is a force to which we react emotionally and morally; we are not indifferent to it; it is blind, inexora- ble, cruel, malicious (blise) or, mayhap, kind. In short, it is the naive assump- tion of language that "necessity" in the course of events is imposed by something like our own will, which also sets limits and passes judgment. The conceptual genesis of the idea of "destiny" is thus a projection onto the universe of the mode of causality we know from our own will and judgment; it is the likes of us. Greek, Roman and Germanic mythology assigned this will to "weird" sisters who presided over birth and life and death, meting out man's lot- from the root for which word in their respective languages the Moirai and Parcae are even named. In the concept of "nemesis" an ethical perspective is introduced, that of fate as a retribution for human presumption. With the Greek daimon (a controlling spirit in a specific situation or individual), fate was transplanted into human consciousness, which was eventually thought of as moved by both a "good" and an "evil" daimon, so that Heraclitus could say: "A man's character (ethos) is his fate (daimon)." Socrates then came to speak of his daimonion, an inner divine voice of advice and warning. These -the daimon and daimonion -are of obvious relevance to Hesse's Demian, and the connection has been frequently pointed out. But Hesse's position with regard to the persistent debate on freedom and necessity- a debate that began with astrology, with Democritus, the Epicureans and Stoics, that took a religious turn in Christian "providence" and was revived under the pressure of scientific modes of thought-Hesse's position was never, to my knowledge, systematically worked out by him in just those terms, although it is one of his basic themes, his views on which we will try to recover. The problem of destiny in its relation to man has been treated by a number of German authors, especially in the fateful 1930s and '40s, and these might be reviewed as a comparative background to Hesse, since the authors in question shared the same historical and, probably in part at least, the same intellectual experiences.3 In addition, by recurring to works that specifically analyse the German word Schicksal, we can avoid the pitfall of a lack of semantic congruence between that word and eitherfate or destiny in English. For these pre- and post-World War II writers, it is the active relationship between the individual and his destiny that is the focus of interest. True, they speak variously of a "distant," a "transsubjective," an "encompassing" destiny that imposes itself on the world as a whole with its hapless denizens, but there is also a "personal," "individual" destiny that may even be seen as one's "possession" (Baden, 18). In the ancient Germanic ethos, we learn from several historical studies, a threatening destiny is adopted by heroically</page><page sequence="5">NEWTON: Hesse's Demian 523 wanting what one at any rate must do (Gehl, 187). (Seneca the Younger also agreed that "Fate leads the consenting and drags the unwilling. ")' For some nonhistorical, more existentially oriented analysts, destiny, being one's possession, can even have a comforting quality and cannot "rebel against us" (Baden, 19). We make the assumption that we can influence it; at least, it contains chance elements (Mfiller-Freienfels, 177). In the ideal case there is a harmony of self and fate (Baden, p. 28). This collaboration of self and destiny implies, of course, that self and destiny are not the same. The self can stand outside and take an attitude toward its destiny (Miiller-Freienfels, 37), consider it a reward, a challenge, a punishment, just or unjust. In fact, "destiny" is itself a value concept. If it were not seen in the perspective of our hopes and wishes it would simply be "what happened." But when we think of destiny we necessarily think of a meaningful power of determination and of the laws by which its judgments are passed (Miiller-Freienfels, 38-39). Since self and destiny are not the same- though locked in willing or unwilling marriage- we cannot say without qualification, as Heraclitus did, that character is destiny.5 On the contrary, it can be maintained that efforts to explain fate as a consequence of character have, in reality, first recon- structed an image of the forever invisible character from the visible events of fate. We claim to derive fate from character, but actually only know character from fate (Mfiller-Freienfels, 151). Seen from this latter point of view, life in its entirety is indeed characteristic for the individual, but for that very reason it is difficult, before its end, to have an as yet definitive image of the self. Even one of the writers on fate during the National Socialist period comes to the, for that time, surprising conclusion that the Germanic concept of fate can sometimes be equated with the modern idea of "self- realization" (Gehl, 195). This cooperative relation of self and destiny has been put into the context of freedom and necessity by Martin Buber in his essay on "Education," a product also of Hesse's time (1925): "At the opposite pole of being compelled by destiny or nature or men there does not stand being free of destiny or nature or men but to commune and to covenant with them. To do this it is true one must first have become independent; but this independence is a foot bridge, not a dwelling place." (91). Note Buber's emphasis that the self must first have won a certain autonomy, before it can willingly become compact with fate. The same idea of communion between destiny (as what is given by the world) and a self-directing consciousness can be cast in empirical psycholog- ical terms, as it has been by Ralph Ross in a study of Symbols and Civilization: "Learning the way in which we are conditioned permits a deliberate manipu- lation of those forces to yield desired ends, to alter the behavior of oneself and others. This is surely as persuasive a description as freedom as we can find" (153-54). Hesse's understanding of the relationship of "self' and "destiny" is dubi-</page><page sequence="6">524 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Fail 1985 ous, we shall argue, precisely in failing to recognize the true nature of each and the necessity of their interaction with the world. 3. As Hesse was writing Demian in 1916-17 in the middle of the First World War, he was still reeling from a series of blows that "destiny" had struck his own personal life.6 His public opposition to the chauvinism of the intellec- tuals that flourished early in the war had called down upon his head a salvo of calumny from his German countrymen; his father died in 1916; his wife verged on a mental and emotional breakdown; his son Martin was danger- ously ill. Hesse entered psychoanalytic consultations with J. B. Lang, a disciple of Carl Jung, in 1916 and forced himself to confront his own inner emotional "disorder" and "guilt." But it didn't take all of this to call his attention to "destiny." Mark Boulby names "fate" and the "concept of unity" as "propositions central to the author's outlook" (Boulby, 165). Peter Camenzind, in Hesse's novel of that name (1904), comes to believe that suffering and death are purposeful in individual lives and learns to content himself with the particular character which, despite his efforts to overcome it, his early life has apparently ir- revocably impressed upon him (GD, I, 294, 369). Hans Giebenrath (in Beneath the Wheel, 1905) still has on his deathbed the look of a person with "das eingeborne Recht, ein anderes Schicksal als andere zu haben" (GD, I, 545). In Gertrud (1910), Kuhn finds destiny to be arbitrary and "not good, " though we can be stronger than it, at least for moments (GD, II, 191), while in "Emil Kolb" (1910) the theme, according to Reichert, is the protagonist's inability to "hear the call of nature within himself," a call that Hesse will later designate as Schicksal (35). In these and other works of Hesse, one finds the word Schicksal in the various usual nuances of meaning that it has in the German language, but basically as a force external to consciousness, one tending to oppose or restrict our personal will. In this early period of Hesse, destiny is not usually isolated from external circumstances and equated with the inner self, as it comes to be in Demian. It is instead a predestined conjunction of external events, or it is the outer events in so far as they impinge on individuals (often the total circumstances of an individual life, frequently seen as significant and difficult), or it is the apparently unchangeable relationship of the individual to the world. In our previous discussion of the concept we saw that, though "determinacy" is obviously constitutive of destiny, this fixity can be variously thought to inhere in the outward course of the world, or to lie within a person's character, or, rather, a partially independent self can be seen in interaction with the givens of his lot. It is in Demian, and in some contemporary essays such as "Zarathustras Wiederkehr" and "Eigen-Sinn," both of 1919, that "destiny" for Hesse</page><page sequence="7">NEWTON: Hesse's Demian 525 becomes a dominant, charismatic idea, one which is posited early in the novel but which, gathering momentum, comes to control the final third of the book (from the sixth chapter on), displacing or proliferating over terms such as "self' or "soul" with which Hesse had begun to state his theme. The destiny idea simply takes over the story- possibly as a means to reach a conclusion by relating the theme to the novel's final action. Ending a narrative is always difficult for Hesse since the spiritual quest of his heroes obviously must not fail, yet it also dare not presume to be a complete success, no more than the life of the author. But it is more likely that Demian succumbs to "destiny" as a welcome self-absolution for Sinclair's and the world's misery, rather than as a structural device. In the novel's prologue (that of the fictional autobiographer Sinclair), Hesse initially speaks of trying to live out "was von selber aus mir heraus wollte" (GD, III, 101). Sinclair is beginning to listen to the "Rauschen" of his "blood"; he is striving to become "completely himself' (102). Everyone is "ein Versuch und Wurf aus den Tiefen, seinem eigenen Ziele zu" (102). Though the intended meaning is the same as that later referred to as "finding one's destiny," the ideas and images here at the novel's outset have a distinct emotive and motivating value; the self is still a potential to be realized, even an experiment; it is open to development. As "destiny" (or "fate") is gradually foregrounded in Demian, however, Schicksal assumes the primary signifi- cance of "the nature of the self that one is predestined to be." Yet Hesse proves unable to avoid stark inner contradictions in the reference of Schicksal. From the sixth chapter on, it is invoked with ever greater confidence and ever greater confusion of signification. The inmost self is sometimes one with destiny and sometimes only its pawn. We have already cited passages from Demian contrasting fate as an external power (the war) with a destiny (the self) that works from within. Though Sinclair seeks only the latter, he unresistingly merges with the former. Destiny must be pursued through icy, lonely spheres, but destiny is to taste love, which is the highest good and utmost evil. Though each individual has his own destiny, it is at the same time really the destiny of all mankind. One's fated self displays an inexorably rigid mien, as it serves a cause it is not free to choose (GD, III, 220), yet we are invited to scorn the conformism of the herd, which has no "personal, freely chosen" ideals (253). However, the masses cannot excuse this cowardice and apathy as a fated weakness; the destiny of plebeians like Kromer, Hesse explains in a letter much later (1955), is "on another level" (a clearly implied lower level) only because they cannot live up to Sinclair's level (GW, XI, 36). We are not told how ethical or aesthetic criteria of level might apply in a scheme of determinism. Hesse's equivocations stem, in essence, from an incapacity to resolve for himself the question of free will. In Demian the great majority of relevant references deny it, and yet without at least some measure of freedom the summons to seek and obey one's destiny- the very theme of the novel-</page><page sequence="8">526 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Fall 1985 would appear radically meaningless. If man is truly without choice it is futile to admonish him in any way, while, on the other hand, if Hesse thinks publishing the message of Demian is to some avail, it must be because he credits his public with the ability to respond. Unless, that is, Hesse wished to argue that his book's fated publication is destiny's way of effecting his audience's destined response-which could not be disproven. But such arguments would certainly transport us into a realm where human thought and feeling, and hence literature, are no longer of concern. In fact, Demian leads us partway into just such a realm. The novel is fraught with expressions of unequivocal determinism. Demian declares outright, "Man hat naimlich keinen freien Willen" (GD, III, 150), although he qualifies it by saying one cannot think what one wants to, a sticking point in all discussions of free will. (Perhaps we can freely carry out our "wanting," our intentions, but if our "wanting" in turn were itself really free, i.e. random and unrelated to outer or inner circumstances, to past or present, to world, body or spirit, it would not be our wanting, but something happening to us.) Demian then explains that the will is free to carry out commands "from within" (GD, III, 152). Yet this inner self is later shown to be determined when Sinclair has the insight: "Es gab fiir jeden ein 'Amt,' aber fiir keinen eines, das er selber wihlen, umschreiben und beliebig verwalten durfte" (220). One may end as a poet, madman, prophet or criminal, "Dies war nicht seine Sache, ja dies war letzten Endes belanglos. Seine Sache war, das eigene Schicksal zu finden, nicht ein beliebiges" (221). Among the possible callings mentioned here, incidentally- poet, madman, etc. - one notes none for which Hesse would not readily admit himself eligible. Sinclair doesn't consider the possibility of having to settle for being a doctor, an engineer, a factory worker or a bookstore clerk, the latter two of which Hesse pursued as a young man-and left. As in Steppenwolf later, it is all or nothing, only spiritual extremes are authentic; Horace's classical "golden mean" is declared a German bourgeois enervation.7 "Nichts davon durfte man wdihlen, nichts durfte man wollen. Man durfte nur sich wollen, nur sein Schicksal" (GD, III, 222). Pistorius, Sinclair's tutor in religious studies, says he would like to stand at the service of destiny, without personal wishes ("dem Schicksal zur Verftigung [stehen] ohne Ansprti- che," 221). All men who have influenced human history, we heard at the outset of this study, were able to do so only because they were "ready for fate"; "Welcher Welle [of history] einer dient, von welchem Pol aus er regiert wird, das liegt nicht in seiner Wahl" (239). Hesse's determinism can sound on occasion like Marx's ironclad historical dialectic. At one point (1932-33), he asserts that Communism would come and triumph "auch wenn wir alle dagegen wiren" (GW X, 515). (But at the same time Hesse finds Marx's economic mode of thought specialized, one-sided and inflexible [517]; it is probably the hope Marx gives for moral progress through historical predes- tination that encouraged Hesse.)</page><page sequence="9">NEWTON: Hesse's Demian 527 As we see, by Demian's light we are not allowed to take any attitude toward the earthly works of destiny, a view contrary to the ethos embodied in language itself. We dare not see its act as an ethical condemnation (or support), nor suffer its "bitterness," nor enjoy its "grace." It is not the likes of us. It is simply there, to be accepted as such, as pure necessity, not to be cursed or embraced in its real events. There can be no partnership. This poses fundamental problems of meaning. How can one will the destined self as an unknown content, in ignorance of those concrete character traits, emotions and patterns of thought that surely must constitute any kind of self? True willing must have an object; one cannot will the unknown. And how can one want even this empty necessity, if one is not allowed to want at all? Hesse refers us to natural history. One must conceive this determinacy as a matter of biology and evolution. Whenever revolutions occur, it is those species who are "schicksalbereit" that survive and prosper (GD, III, 239). We know they were ready for fate because they survived, and they survived because they were ready for fate. Fate is simply "what has happened," a tautology. Hesse succumbs here to the circularity pointed out by Miller- Freienfels, ostensibly deriving fate from character, when one has really derived character from fate. In other works by Hesse the relevant passages are also frequently of a determinist bent. "Ein Stiickchen Theologie" (1932), an apparently straight- forward exposition of Hesse's religious beliefs, states quite clearly: "da3 wir wohl nach dem Guten streben sollen, soweit wir verm6gen, daB wir aber fir die Unvollkommenheit der Welt und ftir unsere eigene nicht verantwort- lich sind, daB wir uns selbst nicht regieren, sondern regiert werden, daB es fiber unserem Erkennen einen Gott oder sonst ein 'Es' gibt, dessen Diener wir sind, dem wir uns fiberlassen diirfen" (GW, X, 75). Hesse admits this is couched in almost Christian terms, but he contends it is also implicit in Brahmanism, Buddhism and in Laotse. The spirit of submission to fate is quintessential Hesse: "DaB der einzelne Mensch, einerlei ob er vor dem Weltkrieg oder vor einem Blumengarten steht, die Aul3enwelt als Erscheinungswelt des Einen, Gottlichen erlebt und sich ihm einordnet, halte ich ftir das erste und herrschende Kennzeichen meiner Art.""8 As always with Hesse, however, we can find contradictory views that recognize guilt, moral effort, doubt and self-examination, and even a remark in 1917 admitting that, though the war will serve "der Befrei- ung der Seele in Europa, " this liberation would also have taken place without it (GB, I, 350). Such a private comment subverts the spiritual fatality of World War I as symbolized by the hawk breaking from the egg in Demian, and as expressed by calling the war a manifestation of divinity, in the passage just cited. The simultaneous fixity and force of fate, and a passive reception of it, are deeply implicated in the imagery and language of Demian. Sinclair thinks</page><page sequence="10">528 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Fall 1985 of "destiny" in terms of animal and human images with qualities of rigidity and forcefulness. The emblematic sparrow hawk breaking out of its hard shell is a metaphor for the bursting of the shell of imposed convention by the self (and the shell of an outlived society by the war), rendered in terms of a naturally programmed event. The fleetingly seen Beatrice persists in an image that fatefully changes Sinclair's life; the picture of Beatrice he draws is "eine Art G6tterbild, " "steif und maskenhaft, " "ebenso willensstark wie triumerisch, ebenso starr wie heimlich lebendig" (GD, III, 176). This mingled constraint and dynamism, even violence, are above all reflected in Sinclair's observations of Demian, who is clearly marked as a symbol of destiny. (Sinclair's destiny is said to be his Damon [= daimon = Demian, 178], and in a later image of Demian, Sinclair's fate can be seen in the eyes [223].) From the beginning, Demian's face and glance are pictures of intense and inflexible force; we hear of his "beinah fanatische und doch leidenschafts- lose Aufmerksamkeit" (146); he looks like animals, trees, stars (146); in one of his periodic trances his eyes are open yet unseeing, "starr und nach innen oder in eine gro8e Ferne gewendet," motionless, as if carved from stone, age-old, cold, dead and full of secret, intense life, surrounded by emptiness and starry space -a cosmological aura later ascribed to destiny itself (160- 61). In a sketch that Sinclair draws to record a dream, a picture that resembles both himself and Demian, "Der Blick ging fiber mich weg in versunkener Starrheit, voll von Schicksal" (211). Finally, when destiny appears in the guise of war, it peers out of a "drohend grauenhaften Maske" (251), and the soldiers who "dem Schicksalswillen prachtvoll niihern" have a "festen, fernen, ein wenig wie besessenen Blick, der nichts von Zielen weil3 und volles Hingegebensein an das Ungeheure bedeutet" (254). Here again, destiny has nothing to do with goals, is pure necessity, although implicit in the word itself is the notion of a power that judges and decides. The soldier's look is, by the way, no mere fictional invention. In December, 1914, Hesse reports: "Bei hunderten von deutschen Verwundeten sah ich einen bald miiden, bald erregten, immer aber stillen und fiberlegnen Blick, einen Blick, der den Tod kennt und das Ubrige nimmer allzu wichtig nimmt. Das ist der Standpunkt, den der Biirgersmann sonst nie kennenlernt. Ein guter Standpunkt" (GB, I, 257). This well-established leitmotif of destiny's unseeing stare is hardly com- patible then with a new concept of destiny as the benevolent Magna Mater in communion with the self, when Hesse attempts to rectify his meaning through a new image, "das neue Bild, in dem mein Schicksal sich mir zeigte" (233)- Frau Eva, mother and lover. But even she, with her belated message of love, is also ultimately monumentalized in Sinclair's battlefield vision of her as a "G6ttergestalt, " a cave in starry space, tortured by the pain of her dreams-with closed eyes (255). As with the other fate-images, there is no eye-contact of self and destiny; no recognizable human values are re- flected in destiny's transfixing stare; there is no awareness of mutuality</page><page sequence="11">NEWTON: Hesse's Demian 529 between self and the given world that confronts it. Though these images of destiny contain "vitality" as a semantic feature, finding one's self or one's destiny is normally not viewed as a process of growth or the development of something unfinished, but, semantically, as a seeking, finding or encountering of the pre-existent. One searches for the self, or comes or gets to it, or more passively stands ready for is led or drawn by fate, waits for or comes home to it. A rare exception is the "gefiihrliche und unheimliche Regung des Wachstums" (239) in history. The searcher or finder is the expectant, receptive subordinate; the destiny to be found is the immovable point of reference or unbending force. Thus from various points of view, we have seen that Hesse teaches a self that is determined; its fate is fixed. We know now where we and Hesse stand - condemned to be sure, but without the burden of guilt and self-hatred that haunt free moral choice. Unfortunately, that seems not to be the case. Sinclair and Hesse cannot live with the peace that they have made. For how are they now to strike the spark of moral courage needed to brave the dismay of irrevocable destiny? All systems of fatalism have as their goal the assuaging of spiritual pain- the pain of living with hateful things that cannot be changed, the pain of remem- bering our sins and errors that cannot be revoked, the pain of knowing we should now be attempting what we are idly omitting to do. But to afford such welcome relief, the doctrines of fatalism must leave us at least a remnant of free will, the freedom to willingly accept or willfully not to approve the destiny that is ours. In fact, such doctrines often teach an active pursuit of harmony with destiny, whose laws, the laws of life and nature, we may comprehend and exploit. This is true of both Stoicism and the Taoism that Hesse so admired: "To return to the root is Repose; it is called going back to one's Destiny; going back to one's Destiny is to find the Eternal Law, " we are instructed in the Book of Tao (Laotse, Tao Teh Ching, 591; XVI: "Knowing the Eternal Law"). Hesse's lifelong search for his self is severely constrained in Demian by equating the self with a rigid destiny, an identity he does not insist on so relentlessly in his other works. Hence, in contradiction, there also appear in Demian, especially toward the beginning, passages which concede to the self a freer creative power; in the prologue there was announced the Nietz- schean motif of the self as a "Versuch und Wurf aus den Tiefen" (102). A similar passage in the thematically related essay "Krieg und Frieden" (1918) declares that man is nothing fixed, developed (Gewordenes) and completed, but rather something developing (werdend), an experiment, an intimation and future (GW X, 436). Later in Demian we are allowed the moral autonomy (and implied freedom) to be our own judges (GD, III, 158), and Sinclair does not hesitate to impose upon himself "Verantwortlichkeit und Selbst- zucht" (174) in a cult ritual." In all men there inhere, we learn further, the possibilities of humanity, but</page><page sequence="12">530 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Fall 1985 one must become conscious of them in order to pursue them; thus virtuality can be made manifest through self-insight (GD, III, 200). Indeed, in the very passage where Hesse denies our freedom to choose our life's tasks, Sinclair still talks of our duty to seek ourselves, a duty which would be void without a power of choice (220, also 238). In this same, otherwise determinist context he reiterates that his life is a "Wurf ins Ungewisse, vielleicht zu Neuem, vielleicht zu Nichts" (221), a kind of free-falling Geworfenheit pre- dating Heidegger.'0 And as the war approaches, Sinclair observes that the masses follow each other mindlessly to destruction, but, cravenly, are not ready to die for a personal, free, chosen ideal (253), which presumably does exist, at least for Demian's disciples- this despite our having been earlier told that we cannot "choose" the wave of history we ride (239) and that he who seeks destiny can have no "ideals" nor "models" (Vorbilder, 222). (Else- where Sinclair claims that Demian's clique are themselves "models" for other seekers. Hesse's thought is often crassly contradictory within pages or lines.) The dimension of freedom is primarily recaptured in Demian by the Roman- tic and idealist subterfuge of inverting the external world into the solipsistic self: "Unsere Seele [hat] immerzu teil an der bestandigen Erschaffung der Welt. Vielmehr ist es dieselbe unteilbare Gottheit, die in uns und in der Natur t~itig ist. . . alles Gebildete in der Natur liegt in uns vorgebildet, stammt aus der Seele, deren Wesen Ewigkeit ist, deren Wesen wir nicht kennen, das sich uns aber zumeist als Liebeskraft und Sch6pferkraft zu fihlen gibt" (189-99). It is a telling sign that the word Seele occurs here, with all its connotations in German thought, rather than a word for "self' or "destiny." The Romantic soul gains its dignity and freedom by being one with nature and therefore not confronted by it as a challenger. At the same time, a soul which is the pattern of nature, a soul unknown- and thus unfixed-in its grounds, which infuses the power of love and creation, must be a force subversive of rigid fate. (Only infrequently does Sinclair later speak of freedom and love [227]; talk of love is restricted to the maternal figure of Frau Eva [235-36, 241], but this rather casual love- motif is never integrated with the "coldness" of destiny or war as a necessary rebirth.) Humanity (Menschheit) too, like the soul, is a distant future, whose image no one knows, whose laws are nowhere written and hence undeter- mined (237). (Despite this supposed ignorance of future man, Sinclair himself is quite sure what "der Wille der Menschheit" is not- it is not one with "heutige Gemeinschaften" [229].) In fact, what nature "wants" with mankind can look different every day (229), a peculiarly indecisive fatality, if that is what Hesse intends it to be. Similarly irresolute is the "dream" that Sinclair seeks, which Frau Eva calls his "destiny," but which, she says, can and will be replaced by another dream, which in turn Sinclair must not hope to retain (234). Perhaps she means that life's stages are each a separate destiny, but this would be an unusual use of the word.</page><page sequence="13">NEWTON: Hesse's Demian 531 Thus, Hesse's contradictory efforts to encourage freedom despite the iron bondage of destiny end up in the realm of dreams, ideals, mystical oneness with nature and the distant future. To be sure, the realm of freedom discovered here is a highly subjective one. According to Pistorius, however, it is the only reality: "Es gibt keine Wirklichkeit als die, die wir in uns haben"; our images of the outside world are not what is real (206). Like Leibniz' monads we live in isolated introspection but share our soul-essence with the world, so that in some ontological sense we are not really subordinate to its rude necessities. Demian's implicit stratagem for freedom is not un- precedented in German thought. It is to gain a spurious autonomy for the self by rejecting the independent reality of the world outside our selves. 4. Whether destiny be immutable or allow some moment of freedom, in either case its seat, its center of action, could be grounded in practice either in the self or in the external world. On this question Hesse vacillates too. Heraclitus proclaimed that character is destiny, and he was echoed by Novalis: "Schicksal und Gemuit sind Namen eines Begriffes, " a maxim thank- fully copied by Sinclair under his sketch of Beatrice that, at the moment, portrays his destiny (GD, III, 178). Friedrich Schiller, of course, outdoes himself in such proverbs: "In deiner Brust sind deines Schicksals Sterne" (Die Piccolomini), "Dein Schicksal ruht in deiner eigenen Brust' (Die Jungfrau von Orleans), and Shakespeare had said it all already. However, destiny and fate in their original conception (of which the above psychological twist is a "modern" interpretation) are an external power, and this is true also in Hesse's most frequent use of the word, in Demian and elsewhere. But again not without contradiction. There is a crucial difference in assuming our character or self to be the prepotent agent in our lives, or in seeing our vast milieu and its history as sovereign over our own feeble efforts. If destiny is in our character or self, then we cannot lay the blame of our actions on ill-crossed stars; we cannot abandon ourselves and our guilt to inevitable "processes." We are the clearly marked author of our doings. We can claim that, our character being fated, we cannot "help ourselves," but, from the social point of view, the source of the fault is plain. That Schicksal can also reside in external events, however, is made most clear in Demian with the coming of the war, which in the fictional reality of the plot, though not in its symbolism, cannot be held to emanate from Sinclair's self. It is not correct to say with Herbert Reichert that Hesse does not believe in outer destiny. 1 But destiny that does come from without will slay us, while destiny from within strengthens us and makes us gods, as does that outer destiny we willingly accept; this is the teaching of "Zarathustras Wiederkehr" (GWV X, 473). Demian foresees the day when</page><page sequence="14">532 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Fall 1985 he and his followers will be needed, as people willing and ready to go "wohin das Schicksal ruft" (GD, III, 238), and he obviously means a destiny in the social realm. "The will of the future," "the will of mankind" are certainly also fateful forces of historical scope (229). External destiny can even be equated with nature itself; in "Zarathustras Wiederkehr, " a thematic pendant to Demian, Schicksal is the earth, rain, growth, pain--rather in the sense of "the nature of things" (GW, X, 479). On a purely grammatical level, "self' and "destiny" are often cited in tandem but not as one, and the self which is "seeking" its destiny must in some sense be ontologically separate. Destiny thus lurks without, surrounding us. But at other times we must accept that it is really within, or even identical with our selves. And for the major part of Demian that is where we are led to believe it is. This inner seat is implicit both in the solitude in which one must confront one's fate (GD, III, 222) and in the series of self-absorbed human images, of archetyp- ical selves, in which destiny manifests itself for Sinclair. In a number of passages a phrase such as "coming to oneself' is equated with "finding one's destiny" (220-21), or "wanting oneself' is "wanting one's destiny" (222). In the related essay "Eigensinn" (1919), Hesse, quoting Novalis' maxim once more so that we know what he means, assigns heroic spirit only to those who have the courage to make their "self-will" or "own mind" (Eigensinn) into their destiny (GW, X, 457). What we are in our inmost being is what determines what happens to us. (But what determines what we are in our inmost being is not said.) Hence our astonishment when Sinclair's intimate destiny turns out to be an enormously destructive public spectacle, and Sinclair, apparently without question and certainly without a glance at the political map of Europe, sets out as if on a metaphysical summer excursion. Nothing is said specifically about his conscription, about his patriotic fervor or his yielding to social or family pressures. Social pressures may have unleashed his inner conflict, which is the driving force of the story, but these are apparently resolved by his readiness to comply with social expectations. The ideological antagonisms that were coordinate with the war's political and economic causes certainly could not have motivated Sinclair to this totally unpredictable step, for accord- ing to Sinclair, "die Frage nach den auB(eren und politischen Zielen des Krieges (blieb) nur Oberflache (GD, III, 254). Even Sinclair seems a bit puzzled at the turn of events, and more than one critic has balked entirely. Mark Boulby, otherwise sympathetic, rejects the equation of "the self-discovery of the individual with the destruction of old Europe" (Boulby, 199) and attributes it to the spirit of neo-Nietzschean evolu- tionism, with which, he claims--incorrectly, I believe, in view of Demian's "will of the future"- Hesse was "so little in sympathy." Ernst Rose feels obliged to shield Hesse's pacifist reputation against an apparent affirmation of the war; accordingly, Rose says, the war symbolizes for Hesse the reshap- ing of the world by the spirit (55). Even by Rose's view, however, the novel</page><page sequence="15">NEWTON: Hesse's Demian 533 affirms the ultimate function of the war, if not its suffering. Theodore Ziol- kowski likewise justifies on a purely symbolic plane Hesse's merger of per- sonal destiny with the outbreak of the war; he sees the war as a "result rather than the cause" (101) of Sinclair's alienation. Since men are destined to live alone, Ziolkowski reasons, war must come to dissolve the bonds of society. Of course in historical fact as well as in Demian itself, quite the opposite phenomenon occurred: the war tightened communal bonds on every side. Critics have thus tried to sweep Demian's war under their artfully pat- terned symbolic rugs- but it clearly won't stay there. The war was real for Hesse, and it is a real event in Demian. The same metaphysical interpre- tation of the real war's "meaning" (as a spiritual rebirth) that we find in Demian (GD, III, 254), is to be found also in Hesse's personal letters and journalism, so it is not a symbolic invention peculiar to the structure of the novel. Hesse really saw the war that way, as a destiny, the emergence of a "new humanity." The problem of the logic of the novel's conclusion is that Hesse, after initially positing the theme of the search for the "true self," begins to rigorously identify the self with destiny; and then his ambiguous conception of what is meant by destiny shifts in the course of the work until destiny comes to signify "world history"- thus logically forcing Sinclair to march with the infantry in pursuit of his true self (and thus, too, absolving him of any decision or share of guilt). The shift of the center of initiative and responsibility from self to history goes the more unnoticed the more we focus on the emblem of the hawk breaking out of the shell, which provides a smooth tertium comparationis between Sinclair's personal rebellion and the outburst of societal tensions in the war.'" The basically consenting attitude toward the war in Demian is not as un-Hessean as it might seem. Though no extended point can be made of it here, Hesse's position with regard to the war was more ambiguous than it is often claimed to be - for which Demian itself would, indeed, be sufficient evidence. Ralph Freedman's Hesse-biography has made the author's ambiva- lence quite clear (165-80). In late 1914, for example, Hesse wrote: "Die moralischen Werte des Krieges schditze ich im ganzen sehr hoch ein. Aus dem bl6den Kapitalistenfrieden herausgerissen zu werden tat vielen gut, grade auch Deutschland, und ftir einen echten Ktinstler, scheint mir, wird ein Volk von Minnern wertvoller, das dem Tod gegentibergestanden hat und die Unmittelbarkeit und Frische des Lagerlebens kennt" (GB, I, 255-56). In late 1915 (over a year after the war began), an article in the Neue Ziurcher Zeitung spoke, in Freedman's paraphrase, of "the warmth of togetherness among people struck by an identical fate" (173), and in another article pointedly disavowing pacifism he remarked that war, though terrible, "had its place as a means to an end" (Freedman, 177). Hesse was assuredly no warmonger, but in these years preceding the</page><page sequence="16">534 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Fall 1985 composition of Demian (1915-16), his private opinions were closer to those of the novel than previous critics have wished to admit. In Demian, too, the community of fate suddenly exhilarates Sinclair, and the war is a means to an end, the agonizing but necessary rebirth of man's spirit: "Wer geboren werden will, muB eine Welt zerst6ren" (GD, III, 185), and "Die Welt will sich erneuern. Es riecht nach Tod. Nichts Neues kommt ohne Tod" (247). In the context these can only be read as affirming the necessity and ultimate value of the very real First World War, whose incredible human costs and unstable conclusion were matters of fact at the time of Demian's publication, but a vindication of whose sacrifices would be reassuring to many in defeated Germany (and probably elsewhere). If one had cared to assert, at the time, that this was an irrationalist mythol- ogizing of the war, Hesse would have replied as late as 1932 (on the basis of his essay, "Ein Stiickchen Theologie") that those who like him are "pious" (fromm) - as opposed to those who are "rational" (verniinftig) - tend indeed to mythologize the world and because of that may not take it seriously enough: "[Der Fromme] mythologisiert die Welt und nimmt sie hiufig dar- tiber nicht ernst genug" (GW, X, 84). But, he would say, it is the fanatically "rational" spirits who start the wars, although the quiescent "pious," if drawn fatally into the "Vernunft-Maschine" of war, share the guilt of their own death (GW X, 85). Basically, though, the "pious" submit respectfully in all things to nature or a higher (not human) will, even if the latter sometimes achieves its purposes by frightful means (83). We are certainly permitted to descend from this mythological level and inquire how Sinclair, who is ignorant of world events and scornful of the societies that generate them, could so rapidly join the masses at the front, although in the kindred "Zarathustras Wiederkehr" (1919) Hesse berates the "herd" for its greater readiness to die en masse than to face alone the darkness and cold of destiny (GW, X, 483-84). Is it not possibly because Sinclair is not allowed to "want" a specific destiny, cannot fill up this empty concept, its pure necessity, with natural human feelings and needs; because he lacks any touchstone to test what is really his destiny? All early indications of meaning in his personal destiny have long since faded by the end- all family attachments, nonallegorical friends, his fascination with the "dark world, " his spark of libido at sighting Beatrice. What he apparently finally wants is to take refuge in a state of being that does not oblige him to want any specific thing, to rescue "himself' (whatever that may be) from his empirical self, its conflicts, challenges and misdeeds. How will we know such an empty, lonely destiny when it comes our way? Somehow, Sinclair himself can "recognize" unfailingly his destiny in each new avatar. But it is a logical puzzle how we may gain such a priori knowledge, before we live, of what our fate must be, so that alone - as Hesse empha- sizes - we can find our way along an unwavering course and avoid all escapist flights into those petty "'Aufgaben,' die der Tag und das Volk zu vergeben</page><page sequence="17">NEWTON: Hesse's Demian 535 hat" (GW, X, 483), tasks that deflect us from the goal of finding our self. We can have no ideals or models to guide us; we can take no direction from past experience of satisfied wants and rewarding communion with others. This our "pure" fate must be completely random and for us unprecedented, and hence in some sense not our fate. This is what happens when destiny ontologically precedes the self.: Since Sinclair can want nothing but abstract destiny, he cannot find "himself'"- which is a complex of natural desires and accumulated judg- ments-so that, in this state of receptive passivity, the world thrusts its own engagement upon him in the form of the war. In this incapacity to accept the engagement of daily activity, Sinclair resembles Goethe's Werther. (When Demian appeared in 1919, Thomas Mann, we already noted, compared its fervent reception with that of Werther.) Werther lives from, but then loses, an enlivening sense of oneness with nature's soul. Sinclair seeks a sustaining oneness with fate beyond the torment of good and evil. Neither can draw his emotional support from a world of finite and fallible activity. The very idea of "community" appears negative in Demian, save for the league (Bund) of those who bear the mark of Cain--a position, incidentally, that is contrary to the contemporary emphasis by German cultural critics on community (Gemeinschaft) as opposed to society (Gesellschaft). Community as found in prewar Germany, Demian opines, is a "Zusammenhocken," an "Abladen des Schicksals und Flucht in warme Herdennahe!" (225). (De- spite - or because of? - his alienation from the herd, Demian was "correct" enough to become a Lieutenant in the Reserves, 251.) "Zarathustras Wieder- kehr" confirms expressly that "Einsamkeit ist der Weg, auf dem das Schick- sal den Menschen zu sich selber fiihren will" (GW, X, 481); to confront one's destiny one must abjure mother, homeland, nation, fame, the pleasures of community (483). According to Sinclair's guide Pistorius: "Wer nur noch das Schicksal will, der hat weder Vorbilder noch Ideale mehr, nichts Liebes, nichts Tr6stliches hat er! . . . Er darf auch nicht Revolutionar, nicht Beispiel, nicht Mirtyrer sein wollen. Es ist nicht auszudenken-" (GD, III, 222). Indeed, it is difficult to imagine, for mother, homeland, life's mission define exactly what is usually meant by destiny in any normal use of the word. This total isolation is tantamount to an abandonment of identity, of the very desire to find out all that one might be; in practice it would be close to a catatonic state. Thus defined, destiny is actually a contradiction to one's inner self. 14 Hesse knows this too- at other times. Despite his rhetoric of loneliness, Hesse knows that we cannot flee with ourselves into a kind of cosmic space. (Flight into mystical oneness with the earth, as in Siddhartha, is his more plausible escape maneuver.) In an essay written during the war, he concedes: "Aus Beziehungen zwischen mir und der Welt, den 'anderen,' besteht ja einzig mein Leben" (GW, X, 436). We have seen that in Demian the soul is the seat of the power of love, and though rather half-heartedly stated as</page><page sequence="18">536 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Fall 1985 a motif, and then not reinforced, the image of destiny presented finally by Frau Eva is no longer so severe and socially isolating as previous ones (GD, III, 233). Of course, Hesse was by nature always at war with society and the state, whatever its politics. In 1933, despite his disgust with events in Germany, he could write: "ich habe also gegen das Dritte Reich keine andere Ablehnung und Opposition als ich sie gegen jedes Reich, jeden Staat und jede Gewalt- ausdibung habe" (GW, X, 505). But in reality he had many loyal friends, and, as inauspicious as his youth might seem in that regard, he became a produc- tive, conscientious and respected member of society. The loneliness of destiny he depicts is the inner loneliness of his own chosen life, of his particular "self." As a consequence of Hesse's identification of destiny and self, however, the self in Demian is portrayed as being generally in social isolation, to a degree which probably does not exist for nonfictional human beings. Even the social outcast, like Hesse, is, in the real world, locked in mortal struggle with the society that has wronged him, with family, homeland, etc. Neither Sinclair, nor Hesse, nor any of his readers grew up like Kaspar Hauser. Just as "pure" destiny precedes any self in Demian, so their meeting place is hanging in thin air. 5. To restate the invalidating flaw in Hesse's notion of "destiny": he implicitly assumes that we can "find" our destiny by a sort of desperate introspection, by a vision of an archetype or in a single all-significant encounter with ... what? Well, with "destiny"! His motto is: Destiny now. Destiny is the guardian angel of our "self," and we must wrestle and overcome it in order to begin to live. Of course, Sinclair's instant destiny and the search for an absolute self ontologically presuppose one another. By contrast, the destiny of an empirical self, what it will be at its ultimate unfolding, is inaccessible to introspection and, in fact, incomplete at any given stage of life. Only at life's end, by retrospection, will destiny have been fully revealed--and then not auto- matically, like the unfolding of what was always in the bud, but often as the final picture-frame in a suddenly severed film. And prior to that final and fixating frame, what we have followed was an unresolved confrontation of self and the world, or, in the better case, their useful collaboration. J. G. Herder had noted, even in a prepsychological age, how impossible it is to focus on a clear image of the true self. "Wir gehen mit einem zwar lebendigen, aber verworrenen Bewu8tsein unser selbst wie im Traum ein- her" (Nohl, 49). And Goethe, whom we could probably not accuse of fearing to face himself, certainly not at the age of eighty, questions the whole notion of self-knowledge:</page><page sequence="19">NEWTON: Hesse's Demian 537 Man hat zu allen Zeiten gesagt und wiederholt... man solle trachten, sich selber zu kennen. Dies ist eine seltsame Forderung, der bis jetzt niemand geniiget hat und der auch eigentlich niemand genuigen soll. Der Mensch ist mit allem seinem Sinnen und Trachten aufs Aulere angewie- sen, auf die Welt um ihn her, und er hat zu tun, diese insoweit zu kennen und sich insoweit dienstbar zu machen, als er es zu seinen Zwecken bedarf. Von sich selber wei3 er blo3, wenn er genielt oder leidet, und so wird er auch bloB durch Leiden und Freuden uiber sich belehrt, was er zu suchen oder zu meiden hat. Ubrigens aber ist der Mensch ein dunkeles Wesen, er weil3 nicht, woher er kommt, noch wohin er geht, er wei3 wenig von der Welt und am wenigsten von sich selber. Ich kenne mich auch nicht, und Gott soil mich auch davor behuiten. (Eckermann, I, 335; 10 April 1829) In Hesse's later novels the sought-for self no longer appears in equation with destiny. Instead, evolving what in Demian remained an essentially aborted feminine symbol (Frau Eva), Steppenwolf presents Jung's idea of the anima in the figure of Hermine, as a symbol of Harry Haller's soul, which he must learn to love before he can lay it to rest (through the symbolic murder of Hermine) in order, selflessly, to be reborn in a less riven person- ality. Harry is, in a sense, fated to do this (Hermine predicts in advance what will happen), but his relation to his soul becomes at least one of progressive acquaintance and love. The search for the "mother," the soulful complement of intellect, is the variant offered in Narcissus and Goldmund, and here the quest is pursued through a more or less real career of creative activity. The earlier Siddhartha also involved a female figure, Kamala, a rather more realistic agent of earthly love, like Maria in Steppenwolf, but here the search does not lead to an anima or Magna Mater as goal, but to a mystical union with the All. The hero ends quietistically but not as a pawn of fate. The Journey to the East and The Glass Bead Game overcome the anguish of individuation through the ideal of service to a community that has specific spiritual goals, rather than seeing service as "readiness" for a destiny which is empty determinacy. Although Hesse's theoretical expressions of fatalism continue long after these thematic changes assert themselves-as we saw, in 1932 he wrote in "Ein Stuickchen Theologie": "Wir regieren uns selbst nicht, sondern werden regiert"-he must have been aware that, taken literally, and not just dispensed hieratically as self-absolution of guilt, a belief in "fate" was incompatible with the progressive achievement of "self, " and was, in the all too pressing reality of things, a social danger. In a letter of 1944, surrounded by another major war, Hesse himself implicitly retracted most of what the conclusion of Demian implies, with its league of Cainites ready to serve an unnamed destiny as a realization of self. Replying to a correspondent apropos a quotation from Ernst Jiinger, Hesse wrote:</page><page sequence="20">538 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Fall 1985 Und charakteristisch in Ihrem Zitat scheint mir besonders der Schlu3 vom Schicksal, das keine pers6nliche Haftbar- machung kenne. So ist es: niemand ist schuldig, man schieBt und brennt die Welt in Triimmer und ist dabei vollig unschuldig, man ist "Exponent" oder "Faktor" oder irgend etwas Geistreiches aber kein Mensch, kein moralisches, unter Gott stehendes, ihm verantwortliches Wesen. Ich gebe, deutsch gesprochen, keinen roten Pfennig daffir. (G W, X, 534-44) Notes The most consistent attention to the fate-motif throughout Hesse is found in Boulby and Reichert. 2 See also Hsia, 171-91. See Naumann, Gehl, Nohl, Baden, Miller-Freienfels. ' Epistolae morales, 107, 11. ' According to Gehl, an old Nordic word for "fate," plural in form, has a singular form meaning "character" (193). 6 In his "Kurzgefa8ter Lebenslauf' (GS, IV, 480), Hesse reports that, until a vital transfor- mation of his life began, he felt in these years that his destiny was an "unselig" one which he cursed. 7 Odes, II, 10. 8 Hesse, Gesammelte Schriften (Frankfurt a.M.: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1957), VII, 497; quoted from Ziolkowski, 106. 9 In "Zarathustras Wiederkehr" Hesse talks of one's responsibility to his destiny, which in the context sounds like a personal commitment to an historically assigned task, but which at least implies an element of free collaboration with destiny (GW X, 482). 10 But the story "Klein und Wagner" (1919) employs the image of "letting oneself fall" to indicate the acceptance of one's fate (GD, III, 550). n Reichert, 44. In "Der Weg der Liebe" Hesse hopes to see the "deserved" Schicksal of Germany's defeat transformed into value and future (GW X, 446). Here Schicksal is in the common, loose sense of a critical situation to be coped with, but it is an external situation. We find frequent contemporary references to external "blows of fate," or "evil" or "wild destinies," where the plural form foregrounds the sense: "critical total circumstances of a person's life." 12 For Carl Jung, too, in 1931, "the upheaval of our world and the upheaval in consciousness are one in the same" (211). But Jung may mean no more than that changes in collective social consciousness parallel changes in social reality, and probably precede them. When Hesse maintains that the war, as the birth of a "new humanity," stems from individuals' search for the true self, he is making a far more unprovable claim, and on the face of it a very dangerous one. 13 This precedence of destiny over self is implicit when Hesse's Zarathustra says that what makes him Zarathustra is having recognized Zarathustra's destiny and that, in general, destiny "soll dich zu dir machen" (GW X, 473). 14 The loneliness of the search for the authentic self, its apparent ignoring of society, recalls Ralf Dahrendorf's discussion of the role of public and private virtues in German life. The former are modes of behavior that tend to eliminate social friction; the latter, with their emphasis on self-perfection, profundity and being truthful, were traditionally most prized in Germany. In a realm of private virtues truthfulness is regarded, "in contrast to the demands of society, as a search for an invisible truth [i.e. Sinclair's true self] ... Indeed, the person- ality of man proves itself by not requiring others at all" (287). But, reflects Dahrendorf, "the virus of inhumanity links up with the absence of public virtues. Both document the same retarded development of civilization. The unreflected readiness to accept as 'nature' or 'fate' even what is capable of being changed by man, indeed, to taboo many changes of 'nature' as well as the struggle against 'fate,' leads to the abandonment of the weak as it does to</page><page sequence="21">NEWTON: Hesse's Demian 539 the humble acceptance of suffering and the renunciation of the rights and amenities of a civilized existence" (92-93). Sinclair's rather brusque and unhelpful treatment of the younger boy Knauer, to whom he offers no other solace than a referral to his given "Wesen," would seem to be an example of this attitude (GD, III, 210).
