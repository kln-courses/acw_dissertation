<plain_text><page sequence="1">that total meaning is built up suggestively through participation. Like Vincent of Beauvais, and unlike Peter Lombard, he will not bring his 'sentences' into concord (p. I2) but instead generates a fruitful discord that will issue in a fuller and more fully tested perception of harmony. There is nothing simple, for instance, in the relation of poet and Amans, nor in that of poet and Latin 'moralist-auctor' (p. 42), and Genius is not a reliable teacher: all he does is to provide 'a storehouse of "ernest" matter which the lover can ponder meaningfully' (p. 53). The 'siker weie' to 'good governance' is taught obliquely, imaginatively, and provisionally (p. 24), with questions kept open 'as long as it is fruitful to do so' (p. 72). Gower 'proceeds by the representation of ideas in fictions' (p. 71), the fictions being 'forms subject to correction' (p. 24). What we can be sure of is that they will be correctly corrected. Olsson's is a meticulously articulated account of the poem that views it as a serious work of moral philosophy and exhortation, its predecessors being the works of Latin commenta- tors and encyclopaedists. He offers an exposition of what Gower says, based on the assumption that what Gower says is what the text signifies (what he means) and that what he says is true. 'The authors of books provide a storehouse of advice', he says (p. 2 I), paraphrasing Gower, and this is how he reads Gower. It is a way of reading Gower, and a view of the function of literature, that some will find unconvincing. Since the 'message' of Gower's poem is irrelevant to us (and it is seriously irrelevant to be told that strife between realms is due to loss of charity (Prol., 11. 892-94) ), the poem is irrelevant except as the historical record of a belief that such exhortation was a means to social and moral improvement. But reading Gower is much more interesting than reading Vincent of Beauvais: perhaps this is because he cunningly conceals, defers, displaces, or even mistakes and confuses the message, so that we have something to puzzle over, comforted with the thought that the puzzles are always already solved and the correct answer awaits us at the terminus. But if, unfashionably, we assume that the Confessio, being a work of literature, is sub- stantively different from Vincent of Beauvais, we shall find in it some dialogic principle of delight, an unresolved debate ('the world stant ever upon debat' (Prol., 1. 567)) between fiction and precept, imagination and morality, English and Latin, the lover and John Gower, John Gower and 'Johannes Gowerus'. Stories are an enrichment of intellectual, emotional, and moral life, and one of the memorable things about them, even when told by 'a truly moral poet' (p. 2) dedicated to wise moralizing, is the way they show the uninevitability of'morality' and 'wisdom' and reveal, too, something of the relation of both to historical structures of power and social control. The more searching these narratives become in Gower, the less ready is Olsson for what they specially do. The longer the book goes on, the more distant Gower's poem becomes.

She argues the relevance of the parable of the Wheat and the Tares which she discerns at the beginning and end of the poem. She suggests that Lollards are punningly identified with tares (lollia) and that false doctrine is particularly satirized through the agricultural imagery. Michael W. Twomey identifies the images in Imaginatif's speech (B xni. I36-44a) 'loue shal lepen out after into this lowe erthe, | And clenness shal cacchen it' as the purity of Mary and the leap of Christ, a figure which Kaske investigated in Ancrene Riwle. James H. Morey discusses the literary, theological, and textual background of a leap in malo, the fall of the rebel angels with Lucifer, arguing for 'pedem' rather than 'sedem' as Langlandian and, suggestively, for a 'particulate' imagery of the Fall in which such figures as dust and snow evoke the disorderly and unnumbered. Raymond St-Jacques supplements Kaske's account of the realism and multiple organization of Piers with an analysis of the Christus Medicus motif as a structural device. This traditional patristic image figures in the speech of Holy Church and at crucial moments, such as the vision of the Samaritan, the Harrowing of Hell, and in Will's seminal encounters with Imaginatif, Haukyn, and Anima. The story of Christ is partly presented through this image and the forces of Antichrist in the last passus ironically include false physicians such as Friar Flatterer. Howard H. Schless compares the allegorical methods of Dante and Langland, pointing out that while Dante places real people against a timeless allegorical background, Langland places personifications against a background of contempo- rary realism. Schless perhaps overstresses this realism (the landscapes of the poem are insistently moralized and allegorically signposted) but convincingly argues that different aspects of such figures as Piers and Conscience are revealed against different backgrounds. Patrick J. Gallacher contributes to the debate on the nature of Imaginatif, identifying the faculty, with support from the definitions of Albertus Magnus and Aquinas, as the sensus communis, 'the coordination of sense experience, informed and directed according to the virtue of prudence and, eventually, grace'. Rather than concentrating on Imaginatif's great speech in Bxi and xnI, he argues that the character is often allusively present in the poem. He demonstrates some of the relationships between prudence and the sensus communis, which completes its judge- ments, focusing in particular on the performance of precise physical tasks, which in the devious fallen world of the poem is easily corrupted into 'gyle', the malign obverse of the gift. The miraculous physical feat of the blind Longinus, which results in his healing and conversion, initiates a linguistic pattern which continues through the episode of the Harrowing of Hell. Thomas W. Hill discusses Langland's views on salvation and Christ's apparent promise of universal redemption at the Harrowing of Hell, with the caveat that the series of dream visions may not be intended to present a strictly consistent position on the subject. He finds some support for universal salvation in Origen's theory of apocatastasis and in material closer to Langland, such as the gospel of Nicodemus and several Middle English works. He tries to put the subject in a contemporary context, warning that hindsight may paint a too heterogeneous picture of a society which was not directly touched by schism or other faiths and in which some views later defined as heretical were expressed by members of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. David F. Johnson also engages with the theory of salvation and the problems of C xI. 296-98a which revises A and B's 'Percen with a Paternoster the paleys of hevene' to 'Persen with a pater-noster paradys oper heuene And passen thorgh purgatorie penaunceles for here parfit bileue'. Johnson argues that, as often, the C</page><page sequence="3">version seems to spoil the brilliance of the earlier texts but is a responsible attempt to restate B with clarity and orthodoxy. He places the passage in the context of the debate about the immediacy of the vision of God after death, arguing that Langland follows the answer given by Benedict II, whereas A and B passages could be understood as following the disputed view promulgated byJohn XXII. C reassigns the speech to Recchelessness to make clear that the doubts about learning expressed originally by Will are not the poet's. Johnson seems to see B and C as merely restating A, rather than a development, and perhaps takes a rather simple view of the poet/persona contrast. He does not engage with the fact that the A version probably breaks off at this point, suggesting, if we accept single authorship of the three versions with the exception of A xI, that these problems did vex the poet at some level, even if he theoretically knew the 'right' answers to them. Two essays address themselves to the more recent critical concerns of gender and narratology. Langland has a striking tendency to personify as masculine qualities which are, by Latin gender and iconographic tradition, usually feminine in allegori- cal literature. Helen Cooper considers his 'radical re-gendering' (p. 38) against the background of this tradition and the medieval rhetorical theories which might illuminate it. She points out suggestively that the boundaries between signification and personification were drawn differently in the Middle Ages and decides that metonymy rather than allegory is the most useful figure as a guide to Langland's practice. On this view, most of the masculine allegorical characters in the poem are parts of the male poet/narrator, and Piers himself is always seen in male roles, metonymic of Christ as of mankind. The poem, though patriarchal in its vision of God and of society, is 'remarkably free of the misogyny or hatred of sex that stalk so many medieval homiletic works' (p. 44). Miceal Vaughan distinguishes between the time of narration and the time of action and between three aspects of the narrator: the dreamer, the 'I' within the dreams, and the narrator for whom the experience of the poem is in the past and who may have learnt from it. Vaughan is sceptical about whether Will learns during or between the dreams and, with reference to penitential theory and practice, points out his failures in contrition and confession to suggest that he does not. Another aspect of recent Piers scholarship is represented by Britton J. Harwood, who joins Janet Coleman and Wendy Scase in considering Piers in the context of contemporary rather than patristic theology. In 'Piers Plowman' and the Problem of Belief he argues that the narrator (whom he virtually identifies with the poet) is primarily driven and tormented by a lack of faith rather than failures of will or of understanding. His problem of belief should be understood in terms of Ockham's duae notitiae. Will has knowledge of Christ by abstractive cognition, only one of the duae notitiae. Although the dreamer believes in God intellectually, he lacks the kynde knowyng of belief in Christ as a person. Harwood suggests that Langland's term connotes or even replaces the term notitia intuitiva. This forms the basis for a largely epistemological reading of the poem. The major figures and the dreamer's dilemmas are defined with a categorical certainty which will either illuminate or seem at odds with the elusive exasperating texture of the poem in its versions and revisions. Harwood points to frequent alliterative coupling of'right and reason' in the poem as more than a formula and equates reason and rectitude. So Reason, if synonymous with equity, cannot help Will with a problem of belief. The narrowness of Reason, thus defined, seems to cause Harwood as many problems as it does Will but the Samaritan rescues him too, oddly enough by using the term quite differently. This enables Harwood to perform some Houdini-like manoeuvres and escape trium- phantly from his own constrictions: "'Reson" constitutes the Law rather than knows the Christ. And as it informs the moral conscience, it becomes the knowledge of a scene where, for salvation, only the knowledge of Christ will do' (p. 50).

In his discussion of the third vision, for example, he compartmentalizes Will's allegorical mentors and pins a precise label on each. Thought represents the rational soul in its abstractive and divisive modes, the highest intellectual faculty short of intelligentia: thus he misleads Will by producing the abstraction Dowel and dividing it into the positive, comparative, and superlative terms. The precision of Harwood's definition may similarly allure but mislead the reader: perhaps Thought does not represent one mental activity whose limitations are easily understood but, more blurrily, all Will's thinking for 'seuen yeer' (B VIII. 75) in all its obsession, complexity, illuminations, and misdirections. Perhaps Will is released from the labyrinth of his own mind by Imaginatif not because this character personifies 'the faculty for making similitudes' (p. 85) (metaphors, as Harwood admits, 'run all through Piers, of course' (p. 86)) but because he leads Will out of his own mental processes into the vision of Kynde. Similarly Study, despite her account of her various achievements (for example, 'Plato the poete, I putte hym first to boke' (Bx. 175-81)), is reduced to the lectio divina and discussed in terms of orality rather than literacy, while Clergy becomes the understanding and exegesis ofallegoria. There is much of interest in this account but it cuts Piers down to a smaller, if clearer, poem. KING'S COLLEGE LONDON PRISCILLA MARTIN Seeing the 'Gawain'-Poet: Description and the Act of Perception. By SARAH STANBURY. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. 1992. x + I55pp. ?22.95. In this lucid and engaging examination of the four poems of British Library, Cotton MSS, Nero AX, Pearl, Purity (Cleanness), Patience, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Sarah Stanbury concentrates on a crucial aspect of these texts: the way they use description as part of their evaluative processes and more particularly how, through description, they approach the problem of determining the significances and interrelation of sensory and spiritual perception within models of human understanding. This approach is especially fruitful in the chapter on Pearl, in which Stanbury usefully compares the description of the dreamer/narrator's experience with that of St John as medieval iconography represents it in manuscripts of the poem's main source, Revelations. Manuscript illustration both defines John interestingly in spatial terms with regard to his vision of the heavenly city and conveys how the divine redirects John's human desire to spiritual ends, and thus powerfully complements the Gawain-Poet's own interest in 'spatial complexity' and human perception: awareness ofJohn's spiritual position gives further poignancy to the Pearl-dreamer's location in the world of the senses. The readings of Purity and Patience are more limiting, perhaps because the argument that the texts show one 'how to read' in spiritual terms appears tacitly to assume that a perfect mode of knowing somehow exists 'outside' the human, that the idea of the sight of God is not itself a human construct, whereas I would argue that the Gawain-Poet's play on language in these two poems works to suggest the reverse. For example, to assert that Purity 'offers methodologies for interpreting God's law' (p. 7I), is to be over-optimistic about the possibility of our perceiving the ways of God when the poem's relentless anthropomorphism of the Diety tends rather to throw back to humanity only a distorted image of itself. The 'dissonance between tenor and vehicle' in the Wedding-Feast parable is curious as a means to 'heighten- ing' emphasis on models of Christian behaviour (p. 45).
