<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Last Algonquin. Theodore L. Kazimiroff. New York: Walker and Company, 1982. xxv + 197 pp. $12.95 (cloth). Peter Ramsden McMaster University The Last Algonquin is the story of Joe Two- Trees, an Algonkian Indian who was encount- ered by the author's father, then a small boy, living alone on Hunter Island in the Bronx in 1924. Over a period of months Two-Trees told the boy the story of his life, from his birth on Hunter Island in about 1840, through his travels and adventures in New York and Pennsylvania, to his eventual return to Hunter Island in 1862, and imparted to him much of his knowledge of aboriginal crafts, subsistence, and folklore. In this book, Kazimiroff has written the story of that friendship between the old Indian and the young White boy, and has reconstructed a nar- rative tale of Two-Trees's life all of which was told to him as a child by his father. It is difficult or impossible to confirm the historical veracity of the story, but on the whole there is no reason to doubt the author's own conviction that its basic outline is factual. One would expect embellishments in a thrice-told tale such as this, and certainly Kazimiroff has made good use of literary license in turning it into a readable piece of what might be termed biographical fiction. Anthropological readers may be irritated by some of the embellishments, from the mislead- ing implications of the title to what I found to be an overuse of the "one-with-nature" omnis- cience of Two-Trees and the anthropomorphic attributes of certain animals. As an enjoyable book, however, The Last Algonquin succeeds. The narrative of Two-Trees's wanderings is an engaging story, well told. Particularly poignant are those passages describing the mutual misunderstanding and mistrust between Two- Trees and the bewildering White society he en- countered, as well as the occasional passing friendships formed along the road. I expect that The Last Algonquin will be well received by the general public, and we as an- thropologists should be pleased that this book, although perpetuating some harmless ethno- graphic misconceptions, will undoubtedly heighten popular awareness of and interest in Native American culture and history. An inter- ested public is, after all, our bread and butter.</page></plain_text>
