<plain_text><page sequence="1">DOMINANCE ORDER IN THE CRAYFISH ORCONECTES VIRILIS (HAGEN) RICHARD V. BOVBJERG Department of Zodlogy, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri T problem of dominance rela- tions among invertebrate species has received scant attention rela- tive to that of vertebrates. This has been repeatedly recognized by Allee and sum- marized by Allee, Emerson, Park, Park, and Schmidt (1949, p. 411); by Allee and Douglis (1945), and by Pardi (1948). Records of this phenomenon in inverte- brates is therefore important if only as an antidote to the conception that domi- nance relations are peculiar to verte- brates. Such reports are of interest as well to the student of comparative psycholo- gy and evolutionary origins of social be- havior. If these social relations are not merely laboratory manifestations, they are also of importance in the structure of ecological communities. Of the few investigations on domi- nance relations in the invertebrates, the only one of an extended nature is Pardi's excellent demonstration of dominance order in Polistes wasps. This is the only such study concerning insects. Two re- ports of a preliminary nature describe dominance order in crustaceans (Allee and Douglis, 1945; Douglis, 1946). Two- rank hierarchies were observed among the small hermit crabs, Pagurus longi- carpus; three- and four-rank hierarchies among lobsters, Homarus americanus; and interspecific hierarchies among lob- sters, blue crabs, Callinectes sapdius, spider crabs, Libinia emarginata, and the large hermit crabs, Pagurus polycarpus. Aggressive behavior as such has long been recognized in social insects, beetles, a recently reported instance in dragon- flies (Moore, 1952), and in spiders and crustaceans. Aggressive actions in the crayfish, Cambarus virilis, were noted by Roberts (1944). Tinbergen (1939), while investigating chromatophoral changes in mating Sepia oficinalis, observed aggres- sive behavior between males confined in aquaria. The author has observed such behavior in female squid (Loligo sp. of Monterey Bay, California) following egg- laying. Where these animals live in cer- tain contiguity, it would be of interest to investigate their tendencies to form so- cial hierarchies. Some years ago, working in the laboratory of WV. C. Allee, prelimi- nary unpublished investigations were made on crayfish dominance relations. Utilizing techniques emerging from these studies, further observations have been made on the crayfish Orconectes virilis (Hagen). This paper reports these find- ings. Field observations of O. virilis in its characteristic habitat-the rock- and gravel-bottomed streams and lakes of the central states-reveal tension contacts between foraging individuals and those backed into crevices under rocks and logs. Evictions frequently follow such</page><page sequence="2">174 RICHARD V. BOVBJERG contacts. The dominance relations are obscured by the territorial factor, and systematic study is difficult under natu- ral conditions; only pair contacts were observed. It was the purpose of these in- vestigations to take small groups, large enough to contain more than two ranks, to determine whether under laboratory conditions they would form social hier- archies. PROCEDURE The specimens were obtained from Wil- liams' Creek, Creve Coeur, Missouri. All were healthy adults with intact append- ages. Groups of four of the same sex and size were established in round, stacking bowls 20 cm. in diameter, with a gravel substratum. This monotonous and con- fined environment with no places of ref- uge was highly artificial but eliminated the factor of territoriality or possession of a "home." Water was changed and the animals fed on lettuce and meat scraps every third day. Ten replicate groups, five males and five females, were each observed in daily i-hour periods. All tension contacts were recorded in abbreviated notation. Indi- vidual crayfish were distinguished by markings of varicolored fingernail lac- quers. Tension contacts were defined as any contact between two crayfish in which one was clearly in retreat following a head-on encounter. This excludes ran- dom crawling over one another, retreat from a rear contact, or the general melee following some strong stimulus within, or external to, the group. Within this defini- tion, tension contacts could be catego- rized as one of four types: avoidance, threat, strike, or fight. (The shorthand notations for these being a, t, s, f. For instance C s D is read as a contact in which animal C struck D, with the re- treat of animal D.) These levels of ag- gression warrant a more complete de- scription. The most dramatic contact is the fight between two crayfish locking chelae and using the walking legs for leverage to force the antagonist onto his back in a position to be consumed.1 This is rarely carried to such a conclusion unless one of the crayfish has recently molted. The fight may last several minutes and is al- most always terminated by disengage- ment and retreat by one of the animals. The strike is a unilateral aggression, in which the aggressor approaches with out- spread chelae, which are thrust suddenly at another, eliciting a retreat by the latter. The threat is an approach with out- spread chelae in strike position sufficient to cause retreat in the other animal. The elicitation of avoidance, with no threatening behavior discernible to the observer, is frequently noted, the sub- servient animal retreating from a moving individual or giving that animal a wide berth in its own movements. RESULTS The data recorded from daily observa- tion periods were compiled into a check- erboard type of table (see Table 1). The letters designating individuals head the columns vertically and horizontally, en- abling the investigator to compare any two animals in the group. Dominance is read in horizontal columns and subordi- nance vertically. Total dominant con- tacts are recorded at the right of each horizontal column, and total subordi- nance at the base of each vertical col- S'An objective attitude is imperative in this type of study, and every effort was made to maintain this. The data were not examined during the weeks of ob- servation; therefore, no knowledge of rank was pos- sible. However, in describing aggressive behavior, it is justifiable to employ certain descriptive words without anthropomorphic implication.</page><page sequence="3">DOMINANCE ORDER IN CRAYFISH 175 umn. The key data from ten such tables are condensed into Table 2. The tabulated data from the ten groups include a total of 2,238 observed tension contacts, varying from 92 to 381 contacts per group.

The dominant animal in each case is readily discernible, as is the subdominant. The third and fourth ranks are frequently dif- ficult to distinguish but in all cases are very subordinate to the top two ranks. These data corroborate the suggestions of this noted in lobsters by Douglis (1946). Comparison of individuals where they meet as pairs furnishes the most reliable criterion for ranking the group. It is weak evidence when such contacts are few, as between third and fourth ranks.

BOVBJERG by total dominant contacts corroborates pair-contact data in each case. Percent- age dominance calculations agree with total dominance and pair-contact data. Ranking by total subordinate contacts invariably revealed the dominant, but was unreliable for the other three ranks. As a check on the interpretation of these observations, a maneuver was made which will be termed "social in- version." SOCIAL INVERSION The dominant crayfish were removed from their groups and isolated. Observa- tions were continued on the behavior of the remaining three of the original group. After a 5-day period the emergent domi- nant was removed and reintroduced to the isolated, original dominant, and a second (inverted) group was established. Observations were then made on the be- havior of this inverted group, as well as of the remaining two in the original group. The next emergent dominant from the original group was added to the inverted group after a 5-day period. Finally, the fourth-ranking crayfish was transferred, the inverted group complet- ed, and the original grouping terminated. Seven of the ten groups were inverted in this fashion. The first- and second- ranking individuals, with one exception, re-established their original position through the inversion. The position of the third and fourth ranks was inconclu- sive, owing to the death of one of these in almost every instance. In each case when the subdominant, with its 5-day reign as top-ranking animal, was reintroduced to the original dominant, with its 5-day pe- riod of isolation, a series of vigorous fights soon established the old relation- ship and frequently was followed by days of a despotic type of aggression on the part of the dominant. DISCUSSION Quantitative analysis of the observed tension contacts justifies the postulation of a dominance order in crayfish. A num- ber of qualifications must promptly be appended. The work was done on one species, O. virilis, in groups of four ani- mals under laboratory conditions; the in- dividuals were of the same size and sex. None of these conditions obtain in na- ture. Nevertheless, the establishment of a dominance order implies intrinsic ag- gressive differences between the individ- uals in each group. The important impli- cation of sensory perception and recogni- tion of individual crayfish and retention of this recognition as a form of learning would follow. Sensory mechanisms in decapod crustaceans are generally under- stood and the ability to learn demon- strated (Warden, Jenkins, and Warner, 1934). But the problem of specific cues involved in recognition of a dominant animal remains to be investigated. The categories of aggressive behavior and response were adequate to distin- guish the approximately four thousand tension contacts recorded. The threat constituted 39 per cent of the total ten- sion contacts in the original series, and the strike, 32 per cent; the elicitation of avoidance was manifested in 23 per cent of the total, whereas the fight was ob- served in only 6 per cent of the contacts. Very little difference was distinguished between the ranks of a group with re- spect to these types of aggressions. No pattern of selective behavior to- ward the lower-ranking individuals was observed. In the basic series the domi- nant animals had positive contacts with the second-ranking 438 times, with third- ranking 314, and with fourth-ranking 391. The second-ranking individuals, while having only 18 positive contacts with the dominant, had 147 and 168 such</page><page sequence="5">DOMINANCE ORDER IN CRAYFISH 177 contacts with the third- and fourth-rank- ing, respectively. The third-ranking crayfish had 8 and 40 positive contacts with the first and second ranks, and 65 with the fourth-ranking. The lowest ani- mals had 4, 25, and 38 positive contacts with the three individuals above it in rank. With exceptions to be noted, a re- markable social stability was observed. In eight of the ten groups the dominant individual became so established in the initial 12 hour. After the first 5 days, all ten of the dominant crayfish remained in this position for the entire observation period. Seven of the ten groups main- tained the initial rankings at all four levels for the entire basic series of ob- servations. In the Crustacea generally, the period following molting is a perilous one, since the new exoskeleton is very soft. The ani- mal is less capable of rapid locomotion, and the chelae are inadequate as defen- sive appendages. The effect of this on dominance position is apparent to the observer. Invariably, a newly molted crayfish, regardless of rank, became com- pletely subordinate and, if not removed for a day or two, was canibalized. After recovery from this period, the individual moved back into its previous dominance rank. In natural situations refuge for this critical period could be found in bottom crevices. A number of interesting aspects re- main for investigation. These center about the factors influencing dominance order. Intrinsic factors of body size, sex, and molting are suggested by these ob- servations. Extrinsic factors, such as ter- ritoriality and population density and size, are undoubtedly of importance in nature. Previous observations on heterosexual groups indicate a dominance by the male. When established social groups of the two sexes were joined, there followed many instances of low-ranking males fighting and copulating with dominant females. Investigation of the effects of humeral substances on the dominance order of crayfish could be a fruitful avenue of study. It would be interesting to ascer- tain the effect of ablation and implanta- tion of sinus gland on aggressive behav- ior. The action of hormones from this gland on molting seems well established (Brown, 1944, 1948). While the exact na- ture and operation of sex hormones in crustaceans is not clear, aggressive be- havior could be used as a criterion of rel- ative sexuality in endocrine studies. Size is a very important factor in de- termining the dominance order. The most casual observation of groups of variable-sized individuals reveals the di- rect relationships of size to dominance. Under natural conditions, the crayfish population is comprised of both sexes and in sizes of more than one year class. The problem of natural versus artifi- cial conditions is very important. Certain aspects of this problem were investigated in a small Michigan stream. Four groups were studied as replicates of the labora- tory groups. These were contained in wire-screen cages placed in a flowing stream with natural substratum and foods. They did not have unlimited free- dom to forage, and the groups of four in- dividuals are, of course, artificially small populations. Under these conditions, dominance order was observed over a pe- riod of a few weeks. One difference was noted; there was less over-all activity, and fewer tension contacts were recorded over observation periods similar to those in the laboratory. Whether crayfish actually maintain territories has not been determined. Field and laboratory observations do definitely reveal alteration of behavior when indi-</page><page sequence="6">178 RICHARD V. BOVBJERG viduals have crevices in which to reside. Smaller crayfish can often successfully defend such a "home" against larger in- dividuals. The significance of the labora- tory-demonstrated dominance order hinges on the extent to which this occurs in nature. In a stream, crayfish are dis- tributed continuously. How large a group can be integrated in such social hierarchies? It seems probable that no dominance order as such exists but rath- er a random array of essentially initial contacts, in which the outcome is de- pendent partly on a type of ephemeral territoriality and partly on the intrinsic factors of size, sex, and, as the observa- tions in the laboratory indicate, some de- gree of innate aggressiveness. Further in- vestigation should involve both territori- ality and variable population size. SUMMARY 1. Under natural conditions, crayfish display aggressive behavior; small groups of the crayfish O. virilis (Hagen) were brought into the laboratory, and their so- cial behavior was observed. 2. The aggressions seen in the field were duplicated by crayfish in groups of four confined in small round aquaria. Subservient reactions were found to fol- low (a) active fighting, (b) a strike with the chelae, (c) a threatening posture, and (d) avoidance frequently was elicited by the mere presence of a more dominant animal. 3. Five groups of females and five of males were observed for an extended time in daily observation periods. On the basis of 2,200 tabulated tension con- tacts, it was clear that each group estab- lished a straight-line dominance order. 4. As a check on the initial observa- tion, a technique of "social inversion" was devised in which the crayfish were transferred in order of dominance and at 5-day intervals to a new aquarium. The order in these re-established groups con- firmed the initial observations. 5. Stress is placed on the preliminary nature of these observations and the many aspects open to further investi- gation. LITERATURE CITED ALLEE, W. C., and DOUGLIS, M. B. 1945.
