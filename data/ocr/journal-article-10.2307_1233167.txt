<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES COMMENT ON PROFESSOR PARSONS' ARTICLE IN RESPONDING to the Editor's gracious invitation to com- ment on Professor Parsons' article on Logical Foundations of Economic Research (in the November issue) I must begin by con- fessing a degree of skepticism about the practical value of writings on "method" (a term less pretentious than "methodology") at a highly abstract level. Criticism of particular pieces of work, or at least discussion of procedure in concrete cases, seems more promising. The former suggests giving lectures on the physical theory of harmony and counterpoint to one whose interest is in learning to play a particular instrument. Like these studies, "logical foundations" is a subject of much and quite legitimate interest in its own right. But its relation to actual research is a stage more remote than specific "directions," and one would hardly expect these to carry a practitioner very far. A swimmer could to some extent tell a learner how to do it; but his instructions would be hard to grasp and harder to follow out. Using still an- other comparison, literary criticism seems to be of value chiefly as a distinct art, and to be more of an aid to appreciation than to performance, or helpful in the latter chiefly between quite "ad- vanced" practitioners-and it deals mainly with concrete speci- mens. Abstract logic is to be eschewed rather than cultivated by people who cannot already "think straight." As regards the prag- matic epistemology (it isn't really "logic") of Dewey, I find "a lot of truth in it"; but the same is true of other epistemologies. It can not be that any one is true in a sense that invalidates the others. No doubt one ought to be familiar with them all, but that is a large order. Turning to Professor Parsons' paper, I find the first half of it hard to understand, and doubt whether comment from me would be of value. Also, the topic of Section VI, on Classification in Statistics, is a technical field in which I have no special competence, hence no right to speak. And similarly with respect to the special problems of Agricultural Economics. On Sections IV and V, dealing with the nature of economic theory and its relations to applied economics, I may possibly contribute something, by offering a few rather general observations, without foot-note references. Most of what I say will differ from Parsons' exposition more in form of 112</page><page sequence="2">NOTES statement than in actual substance; I find little to disagree with definitely and only hope to supplement and perhaps clarify or sharpen up a few points. Fact, Generalization, and Objectivity At the outset (Section IV, first paragraph) I should want to ob- serve that the "postulates" of economic theory are not assumptions contrary or unrelated to facts. They are themselves "true," stating general, hence abstract, features of a type of conduct situation. They are hardly completely general or universal. For the "econo- mizing" of means in achieving ends is an "aspect" of conduct which is present in various degrees and even different senses. The economic view may not be relevant; it is not very realistic with re- spect to writing poetry, still less perhaps to ostentatious waste or -a field of special importance in practice-to play and sports. It must be recognized that "economic behavior" as thought of in terms of concrete examples, is (for the leading participants at least) about as much a competitive sport as it is a means of "want- satisfaction" in the meaning of consumption. And this is still more true of politics, of which in practice economics is a sort of hand- maiden. Similar difficulties in drawing a clear distinction between concepts are encountered in connection with exchange (we "ex- change" gifts, parties, compliments, blows-but not as a mode of economizing) and with competition and the market, enterprise, etc. Even the distinction between production and consumption cannot be made at all definite. A related point here is that all these basic concepts have to be defined with reference to both objective and subjective or mental "realities," things that do and others that do not "meet the eye." Economy is a mode of activity that has no meaning apart from an intention to achieve some result which-unhappily but familiarly, and of the essence of the situation-corresponds only "more or less" with what actually comes of the action. If it either corresponded completely or not at all, the case would be simple! I feel that Professor Parsons' exposition does not distinguish as clearly as is desirable between such "interpretive concepts" as the motives of action and "empirical generalizations," patterns or laws affecting or, as we say, "governing," behavior events themselves. The logical difficulty here is very serious, in fact insuperable. We have had much talk about a purely objective, strictly "scientific" economics, 113</page><page sequence="3">NOTES limited to "observed facts," which means statistics, of more or less arbitrarily selected data. For economy involves means and ends, and intentions connot be observed, nor unambiguously inferred from any observed behavior (even if we include all "communica- tion" in this category). The "facts" that are literally seen or handled simply are not "economic" and cannot be; if economizing is not different from objective physical process an economist has nothing to talk about and should make way for psychologists or physiologists, or what-will-you. Similar problems arise in the natural sciences, but do not con- stitute practical difficulties. Consider force and energy in physics, struggle and adaptation in biology-and also "competition." The last is troublesome in economics too, because it belongs in the general field of play already mentioned (or perhaps war) and is really excluded by a strict definition of economic behavior; for "winning"-the "end"in competitive play-has no definite or meas- urable content, either empirical or subjective. (Of course there is no competition between cause-and-effect process as described by a scientific law.) The issue in connection with these non- objective categories centers in their relation to their manifestations, by which they are known, and especially, measured. In physics, the notion of force is a philosophical but hardly a practical puzzle, since a force is known only by its effect and so must correspond exactly with the latter in all respects. In human conduct, we have other sources of information, and know that motive and behavior do not precisely correspond, whichever of several views we adopt as to what the motive is. For the relation is unpredictably affected by error, in several meanings, and by ignorance, and prejudice; and where social relations are involved, outright deception is a fundamental fact. But Nature is "honest." Pure Science and Application It is in connection with the subject-matter of Section V espe- cially that I think all these issues must be clarified. I am pragmatist enough (though I repudiate the label) to believe that one can under- stand a pure science only by considering what we want with knowl- edge, why we ask the questions we do, and to hold that even the most "idle" curiosity must be satisfied by information bearing a fairly close relation to possible choices in action, though it need not be directly instrumental to "prediction and control." On the rela- 114</page><page sequence="4">NOTES tion between economic theory and applied economics, I feel a con- siderable divergence from Professor Parsons' analysis, at least as to what needs clear statement and emphasis. In this field I am im- pressed with a difficulty similar to that spoken of under the head of method-that what can be said in words does not go very far, and is rather obvious, that the real difficulties must be left to ex- perience and judgment. But some help may be had, again, through comparison and contrast with the natural sciences-beginning with physics, but going on to other branches (specifically noting the application to human beings) and also to the disciplines (other than our own) dealing with man as a thinking and choosing animal. The first point must be a repetition, another reference to the rela- tion between forces and effects in comparison with motives and conduct. In physics, force has no "real" place; it is a convenience in thinking; it makes us "feel better"; adds something to our "sense of understanding." The strict positivist must repudiate it as an "anthropomorphism." All that seems to be usable for pre- diction and control is to fit the greatest possible scope of the ob- served phenomena into the fewest and simplest possible relational patterns, or "uniformities of co-existence and sequence," by dis- covering quantitative invariants, valid over time. Logic seems to call for a purely "behavioristic" physics, and the reasons for treat- ing force as "real" raise a deep philosophical problem. It seems to be quite mysteriously instrumental to understanding, which is in- telligibly instrumental to utilization by prediction-and-control. As already noted, many writers, following this line of reasoning, have advocated a strictly objective or behavioristic economics. "Ends," in contrast with effects, are not observable or measurable, and not directly usable for "extrapolation," so they have no place in science; so, out with them. But in this field, the idea hardly makes sense. The objective magnitudes simply do not correspond with the "real realities," the things we are interested in. Looking again at physics, it is notorious that a really physical physics banishes from view all sensible properties of objects-sights, sounds, odors, even texture and pressure-as well as all beauty and meaning. We seem to be dealing with antinomies, dilemmas from which there is no escape, and we have to vacillate between irreconcilable positions and simply "do the best we can." Even less than forces and qualities can we ignore motives in conduct, if we are to talk about "economy." But while forces are merely supernumerary, because 115</page><page sequence="5">NOTES they duplicate the processes anyway, we cannot fit motives into the patterns of well-behaved scientific data. Much of the "un- reality" which critics ascribe to economic theory is tied up with the necessity of assuming, provisionally, that motives are manifested and measured by behavior; and for problems of policy there is the further and more troublesome question of the relation between motives as they are, and what they "ought" to be. All this does not mean that we can build a science of economics, of the sort required for determining policies, without the abstract principles of economics. We cannot build a usable science of nature without theoretical mechanics. But we must not stop with pure theory; we must imperatively keep in mind both that econ- omy involves magnitudes which are not seen or in the proper sense measured, and that all our "values", in so far as they do not flow automatically to realization but give rise to problems of any kind (particularly all of our human relations values), lie beyond exchange co-operation for increased efficiency alone. Again we recall that color and all physical qualities as perceived by our senses exist in a universe that is not broached by scientific physics. The only quarrel I have or have ever had with the "institutional- ist," of whatever strain, relates to the proposal to throw away systematic analytical economics because it is incomplete; "of course" it is only a short first step in the treatment of real social problems. And if any "orthodox" economist says or implies that this approach is by itself sufficient, or that any real problem is purely economic, in the meaning of the concept of pure theory, I am quite as much opposed to him. This is the main point I would make-that "economic theory" along the line of its development by the classical, neo-classical and mathematical schools, is only a step in the treatment of social problems, and a short step, but is indispensable, and logically the first stage. So far, there is a parallel with theoretical mechanics in relation to the engineering sciences. And incidentally, mechanics is fully as "unrealistic" as economic theory; practical problems re- late almost negligibly to its "frictionless conditions," almost en- tirely to overcoming friction. But when we look further into the matter of applications, a vast difference appears, a fact that is not brought out in Professor Parsons' methodology. The practical use of natural science is to increase "man's power over nature," and (in the modern world-view) there is no disagreement about the de- 116</page><page sequence="6">NOTES sirability of that, hence no social problem. Of course there really is a social problem, and of the most serious kind, lurking in the col- lective use of the term "man." For giving man, or men, power over nature almost inevitably gives some men power over others, or anyhow makes it possible for some to get such power; besides creating vast inequalities in power over nature, through command of the specialized knowledge and the instruments which give access to scientific technology and power; and both of these results most of us as ethical individualists find objectionable. Natural science itself ignores such problems, and rightly. But it obviously does so by dumping them into the laps of other disciplines. Not in the main that of the pure economic theorist; his business is also scientific, to investigate one type or aspect of social relations, namely, "free" cooperation through voluntarily chosen division of labor and ex- change (voluntary in relation to given other conditions-ends and means-I shall come back to this later). The main burden finally falls on the moralist or political philosopher, and more directly on "that insidious and crafty animal," the statesman or politician. Group Self-Determination versus Control One must keep on patiently repeating that the social scientist, if he takes his profession as a job and not as "art for art's sake" or playing his favorite game, must be either a clerk of the grand vesier of an autocrat or one of the parties to a free and open discussion of social problems. Only under the former assumption are social problems properly instrumental, a matter of prediction and con- trol, where we can point to controller and controlled. Even in that situation, the existence of motives means that control must take the form of coercion, persuasion and deception, and calls for tech- niques utterly different from the intelligent redirection of natural processes. In a democracy, the practical problem is to secure a fair degree of agreement about the forms of social relations, "rules of the game," and especially on the demarcation between a field of com- pulsory agreement through politico-legal action and that of vol- untary arrangements between the parties directly concerned. In the latter area the freedom of the market is the sector in which the most pressing problems arise, but it is one among many. The prob- lem of reaching agreement about rules is not, correctly speaking, one of means and ends. Pure economic theory (relevant to free 117</page><page sequence="7">NOTES society) must assume that co-operation by mutual assent, pre- supposing the several freedoms of individual economic behavior, is a "right" form of social-economic relations; that there is a "pre- sumption" in favor of such organization, in the absence of better reasons to the contrary. All this virtually amounts to saying that the serious problems of a democratic society are not "economic" in the sense of an indi- vidual's problems; i.e., they are not, in the main, a matter of using given means to achieve given ends to the maximum possible ex- tent, though of course governmental bodies also have to be ef- ficient, to make resources go as far as they can. The major problem is first, to decide which ends and means are to be regarded as be- longing to society, in contrast with its "individual" members (the scope of taxation and of governmental functions); and second, how far and in what other ways society as a unit shall interfere with individual freedom in the use of individual means, or with free agreement between individuals in this area. What are com- monly thought of as economic functions of government fall mostly under two general heads. The first is suggested by the expression "make competition work." It includes removing all barriers to the mobility of labor and other resources (which in principle covers the bulk of the monopoly problem) and we may also include providing information wherever individuals do not have access to this through other and reliable sources. There are, of course, other requirements for maintaining reasonably effective market competition, especially monetary or other measures for minimizing the scope of "cycles" and fluctuations. And the monopoly category includes many spe- cies, calling for varied treatment. There are some "natural" monopolies, where technical and other conditions virtually exclude competition, and a choice must be made between public regulation and public operation of an industry. But more important than all "mechanical" defects of the market- and-enterprise organization are fundamental limitations of the "individualistic" view of society. (The real unit, as a minimum, is necessarily the family, in some form, and the system would more accurately be called "familism.") Competition, exchange, the con- cept of freedom itself, all take the individual as "given," specifically with respect to his wants and his means of satisfying wants, in- cluding his personal capacities (natural and artificial) as well as control over external materials and instruments (natural or arti- 118</page><page sequence="8">NOTES ficial). Only a minor fraction of the population of any society are really "individuals," active members of the economic order (or the political). No one disputes that the continued existence of society, as well as "justice and humanity" requires that to some extent the strong, or the lucky, share the burdens of the weak or disadvantaged. This is a moral obligation of the in- dividual, but it is also indisputably a fact (not to be confused with it) that voluntary charity must be supplemented by authori- tative action. Yet state action is by nature coercive; at the mini- mum, a majority compels a minority, and in practice power is wielded by a majority of a majority, or several stages further, and they elect officials who act or do not act, within a wide range of discretion, and within their competence and fidelity to trust, or the opposite. Thus public policy must find some compromise be- tween individual liberty and the rights of the weak at the hands of the strong. It is a hard question of enough and not too much, where there is no objective measure or definite formula.' 1 If space allowed, we ought to consider another "dichotomy" under the relation- ship of economic theory to practice. In the main, the decision whether social action is called for, and the general nature of what is needful if any, is a matter of "theo- retical analysis" which is mainly a polysyllabic expression for common sense. That is, the important facts and principles are a matter of common knowledge and no "research" is called for. But when action is decided upon, its precise character and amount usually call for quantitative knowledge that is not at hand without special investigation and in fact is typically very hard to get, with anything like the com- pleteness and accuracy needful. But it particularly calls for emphasis that the most important task of economists in a free society is to promote "straight thinking" at the elementary level of practical regard for undisputed facts and their obvious im- plications. To mention the hoariest example, it hardly calls for "analysis" to show that a protective tariff is uneconomical and is only justifiable by special political con- siderations; and even in case of industries required for defense there are less expen- sive ways of fostering them, and empirical proof is hardly possible. The persistence of such problems, which are not problems, is very discouraging. The best "argument" would seem to be something like Bastiat's famous petition of the illumination indus- tries for legal prohibition of windows in houses, to exclude the ruinous competition of cheap foreign light from the sun. At a still lower level than the tariff, if possible, is such a measure as rent-freezing, where the tax and subsidy arbitrarily affect par- ticular pairs of individuals, without regard to need or desert or any defensible prin- ciple of selection. Economic policy is full of such pathetic, stupid and costly measures, based on prejudices like "nobody loves a landlord," or a "foreigner," or a bondholder, profit- seeker, etc. If modern civilization is to survive, the public must somehow be given more objective ideas of the distribution of power and benfits in a competitive econ- omy, especially the absence of arbitrary authority in the hands of the "business man." He is, of course, between the millstones of two impersonal markets which fix the prices he must pay for productive services and those he can get for his product. The profits made by some are probably at least offset by losses of others. And if society proposes to confiscate gains it is asking business men to function on terms of "heads I win, tails you lose." 119</page><page sequence="9">NOTES The Ambiguous Nature and True Role of Values Much of what I am trying to say is bound up in two very differ- ent meanings of the word "value," a truly disastrous ambiguity, and a fact not sufficiently taken into account by most writers. When used in economic theory, this term refers only to individual or subjective desire, as expressed in choice among alternatives presented. To be sure, when choices are exercised on the social scale of a market, the result is to establish an equivalence or scale of values, as (marginal) desire intensities, the same for all con- tracting parties and hence quasi-objective. "Individual" includes every group acting as a unit, and usually means the family as a minimum, also "firms" of all sorts. This value-scale is expressed in a system of prices, of final products and productive services, and also a rate of yield on investment which, in combination with its expected service-value, determines the sale price of any productive agent or capital good. A market is simply an arrangement for ef- fective inter-communication among possible buyers and sellers; it assumes a large number of one or the other, i.e., "competition" on at least one side. ("Rivalry" is no part of rational economic moti- vation, which is to maximize concretely given results; but the wish to "beat" someone affects most human behavior, whatever the ostensible objective.) Theory has regularly considered "monop- oly," now commonly subdivided by separating out "monopsony." And in order to come closer to reality, it has long been found necessary to recognize other limitations of the ideal or perfect market; at least, the theorist takes account of the major conse- quences of imperfect knowledge and foreknowledge and the re- sultant specialization of direction and uncertainty-bearing in the entrepreneur. But "economic values" are still only those actually expressed in "free" choices (not arbitrarily dictated-see page 117). In contrast, as can hardly be too much emphasized, economic policy, and all discussion of any common policy, inevitably refers to values in a very different sense, one which implies some kind of "objectivity," some degree of right-and-wrong, capable of being argued. It involves a distinction between desire and choice as facts versus what they ought to be-just as esthetic discussion must distinguish between "good taste" and "mere" taste, coming under the principle of "de gustibus non disputandum." No discussion whatever is possible without reference to such a super-individual 120</page><page sequence="10">NOTES norm; opposed parties launching at each other assertions of "I want it thus," answered by "but I want it so" are not carrying on a discussion and their activity will never tend in the least to estab- lish agreement. (It ought to be superfluous to say that printing or noise machines interacting in any mechanical fashion do not even assert interests, still less solve problems of conflicting interests; but such mechanical process, with no reference to values in either meaning, is all that a rigorously empirical science would recognize.) But it also lies at the heart of problems of policy that it is very difficult for parties whose interests conflict to reach agreement through an appeal to "values." Accordingly, the supreme merit of the free-exchange free-enterprise form of organization is that it enables people to co-operate up to the limits of their mutual in- terests, without having to deal with value problems at all, and these are separated out for consideration where it is necessary. Each party can have things his own way, as consumer and as pro- ducer, or entrepreneur, and both or all can secure the benefit of the enormous increase in efficiency that results from specialization and organization. All this is achieved by simply accepting the funda- mental principle of individual liberty, either as the supreme "value" -its place in historical liberal thought-or merely as a working expedient. Freedom is obviously the pre-condition of discussion itself. But nineteenth-century liberalism greatly over-simplified the notion and made freedom nearly all-sufficient in a way that is not justified. As already noted, freedom is relative to ends and means assumed to be "given." To one without means to act, freedom is empty. And the fact that one's ends as well as means are created by the social environment is an equally important fact (though it is not often mentioned) while the possession of means tends to be written into the notion of freedom itself, to the confusion of analysis. The early tradition of "laissez-faire" tended too much to take the in- dividual as given, whereas it is obvious that his human character- istics, and the whole concrete substance of economic life, are made what they are by the social-cultural process. And the social problem is surely more largely a matter of the kind of individuals it produces than of relations between individuals taken as simply "there." In the setting of our society, committed as it supposedly is, to the principle of freedom, economic policy problems become really serious at the point where strictly economic problems "leave off"; 121</page><page sequence="11">NOTES that is, the issues have to do with unilateral obligations of the strong (or fortunate) to the weak or disadvantaged, and with rela- tions between individual and community that cannot be handled through informal exchange or co-operation between persons spe- cifically concerned. On the "scientific" side, traditional theory, the mechanics of market organization, is subject to corresponding limitations. It deals with consumption-and-production, exchange- and-enterprise relations and concepts purely in the abstract. That is, it says nothing about what needs or wants people actually have in a given society, what products are created and consumed (or services rendered), or about what means (resources, human and other, or technology) are available and employed or how effectively. Pure theory also takes for granted and ignores, the actual mech- anisms of organization for producing and marketing, or for con- suming, and their organization costs, as well as the moral-legal- political order is which the process must operate. Certainly, it is far from being a complete and adequate account of the "economic life" of a society. The critics of "orthodoxy" are on solid ground so far. But pure theory does not purport or pretend to be complete and adequate-any more, as so often remarked, than theoretical mechanics is a complete and adequate description of the actual machines men build and use, from the standpoint of understanding or of their construction and operation. Hence these "limitations" constitute no objection to traditional economic theory, either as science or in relation to practice-provided only they are under- stood, and its part in the whole project of education and of social management is understood, and it is combined with the results of other disciplines wherever this is needful for handling the problem, scientific or practical, that is under consideration. The discussion of "method" in economics ought never to have been allowed to degenerate into a quarrel or contest between competing "ap- proaches." The limitations of all the approaches, taken individua- ally, are patent to view. The task before us, economists and students of the other sciences of man, is to work out a division of labor in attacking what is finally a unitary problem, and to "co- ordinate" the different contributions. This is indeed a vast enter- prise, and the second part is especially difficult. It should be evident that it is a task calling for cooperation and not competitive promotion of special standpoints by workers in different sectors. FRANK H.
