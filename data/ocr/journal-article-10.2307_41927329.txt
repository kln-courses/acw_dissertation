<plain_text><page sequence="1">SIX UNPUBLISHED ANTHROPOMORPHIC WOODEN SCULPTURES AT GAZAN (KULU) by HÉLÈNE DISEKENS Brussels In the course of an exploratory visit of the cultural patrimony of the High Beas Valley in the Kulu in June 1979, we had the great luck to discover fortuitously a group of six superb large size anthro- pomorphic wooden sculptures. We found them deposited at the far end of the Gazan temple,1 well hidden from the sight of visitors, in the dark and narrow space between the cella and the wall (photo 1). The said temple, of the type "wooden, without pagoda roof"2 is a small and plain village temple which was rebuilt about forty years ago on an ancient site, as proved by the proximity of a several centuries old deodar 3 now stricken by the lightning. The shrine is dedicated to the female deities Docha and Mucha who are supposed to have been the protective Devi of the old raja family of the Kulu. Oral tradition4 regarding the origin of the Gazan temple reports that a cow belonging to the raja always dripped milk when she neared the thornbush inhabited by the two Devi . The king accused the young shepherd entrusted with the care of the herd of stealing the milk and chased him up to the sacred bush where the boy had taken refuge. There, in his rage, the king killed him. After this crime, the raja and his family were afflicted by misfortune and ill- ness. The gur (oracle) consulted declared that, having so deeply offended the Devi , the raja would have to appease them by building them a temple. The temple was erected - at Gazan - but, in spite of this, the royal family died out and its castle was destroyed. The villagers complete their account by precising that the wood used 1 Left bank of the Beas, between Jagatsukh and Naggar. State of Himachal Pradesh, India. 2 Jettmar G.

Jettmar -Thakur by the Gazan villagers, in Autumn 1979.</page><page sequence="2">164 HÉLÈNE DISERENS for the sculptures at present deposited in their temple comes from the belchel (thornbush) of the Devi. However they have really been carved out of deodar wood! They must have adorned a temple of which we today know neither the name nor the location. The age of these sculptures, but still more the absence of proper protection and conservation measures explain the mutilated and battered state they are in, due especially to the combined aggres- sions of insects, moisture and attrition. They are covered with splashes and streaks of mud plaster resulting from the periodical repair of the temple walls. This means that many details of the sculptures are lost under the thickness of the paint. The six sculp- tures represent two male figures in the round and four female figures in high relief, the latter standing against pillars. We shall first examine the group formed by the two statues (photograph 2) which we shall designate by Ml and M2 respectively. In our opinion, the halo and the crown, as well as the larger size (115 cm) of Ml (on the left of photo 2) are sufficient elements for assuming that it represents an important deity, perhaps even the principal deity of a temple. Deity Ml is represented in standing position, in frontal, static and perfectly symmetrical stance. His head is surrounded by a large circular halo adorned with three layers of lotus petals, the relief of which is still rather strong in spite of the wear and tear. He wears a tunic held at the hips by a girdle. The legs are slightly asunder and broken at the level of the knees. Although the features of the face are largely worn off, the eyes and the mouth can be distinguished and show a serene and smiling expression. Above the bulging fore- head, the hair formed of tight curls falls obliquely on the shoulders. Ml wears a royal crown with three spires alternating with open lotus flowers. His well-proportioned body shows through the light tunic which seems to adhere like a wet garment, revealing a high waist and robust hips. Slightly longer and wider on the sides, the garment is widely rounded in the front, somewhat above the knees. The belt buckle is round ; it seems that a double rounded structure and a thin strap which may have served to hang some object to the belt can be seen. The arms of the deity have disappeared, but one can still see the notches by which they were fixed to the shoulders. Because of his royal origin, he wears a necklace and earrings, the weight of which distend the ear lobes. Taking the missing part into account, the statue must have been man-sized.</page><page sequence="3">SIX UNPUBLISHED ANTHROPOMORPHIC WOODEN SCULPTURES AT GAZAN 165 The second statue, M2 (on the right of photo 2), 85 cm high, is as perfectly frontal, static and symmetrical as the one described above ; it however differs from the first statue by the fact that it has neither a halo nor a crown and that it stands on a quadrangular base. This figure, whose head and shoulders lean against a flat and rectangular board, is rather pot-bellied. In this case, wear and tear have com- pletely effaced the expression of the face, but the same style of sculpture is found in the hair and the long-lobed ears. He wears a high and conical headpiece somewhat alike some of the headpiece of Scythian origin displayed in the Mathura Museum.5 The tunic adheres to the body in the same way as the tunic of Ml, but, in this case, the rounded part is longer in the front and ends up at the thighs. The belt is similar to the one worn by Ml, but it is narrower and plainer. The figure wears a necklace hung with a rather large pendant and earrings. The arms, slightly spread aside, have been sectionned at elbow level ; the notches to which the forearms had been fixed can be seen. Both legs are present in this case; they are slightly asunder and are booted. The conventional attitude (frontal stance) and the vestimentary details (tunics, flat belts, as well as the headpiece and the boots of M2) have brought about the hypothesis that these two statues stood in some connection with the solar cult. The majesty, the power and also the serenity emanating from Ml, as well as his halo and crown, induce us to identify him as being Surya.6 At first sight, the identity of the second statue, M2, is less obvious. It could be assimilated to a Scythian personage;7 however, consider- ing this Gazan environment, it could also be another Surya effigy or represent one of his attendants, Danda or Pingala. This ambiguity could perhaps be erased if the location of M2 in the original temple were known. The presence of Surya in this Himalayan area of difficult access8 5 Vogel J. Ph., 1930, p. 23 and pl. IV ; Rosenfield J. M., 1967, ill. 14-16. 6 Cf. Banerjea J. N., 1948, p. 47-100. 7 Basing on a photograph of the Archaeological Department, Delhi, H. Goetz (1955, p. 61) identified and dated as being of the Vllth century two Scythian donors carved in wood, at Haripur. We feel we have to mention this reference, because points of similarity might perhaps be found between one of the donors at Haripur and statue M2 at Gazan. Let us mention that there are many towns or villages called Haripur in India and that there is such a village only a few kilometers from Gazan. 8 The only ways of access to the valley which is closed downstream by ten</page><page sequence="4">166 HÉLÈNE DISERENS is not surprising. Many manifestations connected with the worship of this god have been found in the Indian Himalaya, namely in Kashmir (Martand temple), in all the areas of western Himalaya and up to the present Indo-Nepalese frontier. The similarity that can be found between M2 and a wooden figure discovered at Katarmal (near Almora, Uttar Pradesh) seems to us to justify mentioning the relevant bibliography: Sahni9 describes two deodar pillars in the Sun temple at Katarmal, in the Kumaon; their sculptures remind us of "some of the finest gupta work at Sarnath and other places." On one of the pillars "a standing male figure which wears a conical head-dress and a short sword on the left side appears to be the Sun God." The main deity would have been placed on a central platform in the temple. Agrawala10 has studied one of these pillars which is now in New Delhi in the National Museum. He approximately dates it as being of the IXth century, but, regarding the absence of lotus and boots, he does not dare identify it as being Surya. It is to be noted that the right forearm is held in lifted position, whereas the left arm is stretched down towards an attendant. The personage, approximately one meter high, wears a dhoti held at the waist by a flat belt. He has a short sword at his left. He wears a queer type of cap (kantopa). In the absence of other Surya representations in the area which would corroborate this identification, Agrawala brings up the hypothesis that the figure could be the image of the builder of the temple. This hypothesis has been refuted by Nautiyal11 who thinks that it probably is Surya. The most splendid image of Surya known to this day in the Beas valley is the life size stone statue (ill. 1) found at Hat, near the Basheshwara Mahadeva temple in Bajaura - at present exhibited at Simla in the Himachal State Museum. An attempt to date it situates it in the late Gupta period, at about the beginning of the Vlllth century.12 Surya is represented in standing position, in frontal stance, holding in each hand a stem ending into a rather un- definable form. Could it be a lotus stem, the flower of which, curi- km of impassable gorges were the mountain passes. The gorge road was built only at the beginning of our century. » Sahni D.

According to Ohri,13 the head-dress of the deity resembles the ones worn by some Gupta sculptures ; however, the garment is like the ones found in Kushan art. From the waist belt fastened at waist level are suspended : in the front a yantra-casket and on the left side of the deity a large straight 18 Ibidem.</page><page sequence="6">168 HÉLÈNE DISERENS sword in its sheath. The size of the statue induces Ohři to believe that it might have been the main deity of a today no longer existing temple. In our opinion, its presence in the valley confirms our identification of Ml. Great difficulties are being encountered in the attempt to date our two statues. As a matter of fact, we do not have any guarantee of the reliability of the analyses conducted with a view to date samples of the wood of these sculptures. It will therefore be by the stylistic comparison of the Hat Surya (late Gupta, beginning of the VHIth century), of the wooden pillar at Katarmal (approximately IXth century) and of the Ml and M2 statues at Gazan that we shall attempt this study. For instance, the Hat Surya has a more massive aspect, whereas the Gazan one is more elegant. The jewels and the belt of the Gazan Surya seem to be worked out in greater detail, though, here, there is no sword. These elements are in favor of a hypothesis according to which the Gazan Surya would be posterior to the one at Hat. Let us then examine the figure against the wooden pillar at Katarmal and compare it with the M2 statue at Gazan. The simi- larities of both head-dresses and of the belts induce us to date M2 as being of a period close to or even contemporary to the Katarmal statue. The presence of these two large size statues in two villages so close to each other (less than 50 km separate Hat from Gazan) confirms the importance of the sun worship in the Kulu at a period which could be contemporary or slightly posterior to the construc- tion of the Martand temple, in the Kashmir, at the beginning of the VHIth century.14 Goetz16 situates the culmination of the sun worship in North India between the Vlth and Xth centuries; after this period , the Lakshmi N ar ay ana worship would have taken its place . We shall now study the four pillars bearing female figures. A first scrutiny shows that two of them form a kind of inverted pair of lesser size than the two others which appear to be main deities. We shall first describe the latter which we shall designate as F3 and F4 (photograph 3). F3 (on the left in photograph 3), carved half in the round, is like an apparition from the past, beautiful and stately in spite of the " Brown P., Ed. 1971, pp. 158-9, PI.

We imagine her as being a young woman standing in a barely outlined tribhanga , under a vault of foliage and asoka flowers or fruits. The body, with its high and slim waist, its wide hips in the form of an amphora, is clothed in a sort of form- fitting tunic up to the hips, with wider lateral flaps, the tunic being rounded in the front. The tunic is worn above a deeply nervured skirt which, with its extremely fine pleats, seems to evoke streaming water. The skirt adheres to the legs, the right one being folded be- hind the outstretched left one. The head is wrapped in a light scarf which falls back on the shoulders and coils up around the arms. The features are completely erased and the hair is not distinctly visible ; however, it can be guessed that the ears are adorned with pendants. F3 held an undefined object by the top and the bottom as indicated by traces of fingers of the right hand. Both fore-arms are missing, as well as the end of the legs which are broken between the knee and the ankle. Figure F4 (on the right in photograph 3), equally protected by a vault of foliage and asoka flowers or fruits, reveals the same ele- gance, the same erasement of the relief, but the legs are broken higher up. The body wears a garment similar to the one of F3, but in this case the skirt presents slanting bands of rather large design. The scarf only lies on the shoulders and coils around the arms. A half halo of five or six flowers underlines the left side of the head which is decorated by a heavy earring. The broken edge of the left arm seems to indicate that the deity held an object or an attribute. The right arm wearing a bracelet near the shoulder lies lithely along the body ; it is broken shortly after the elbow. The attitude of the legs is the same as that of F3, though inverted. The two figures are respectively 135 and 115 cm high. Taking into account the missing part of the legs they might have roughly the size of women. The pillars, respectively 190 and 180 cm high, show traces of assembling above the vaults of foliage and flowers. Figures F5 and F6 (photograph 4), both 85 cm high, are incor- porated into pillars measuring 160 and 130 cm. At the top, a rectangular entablature, decorated with geometrical designs, surmounts a small niche as described precedingly, which contains foliage and asoka flowers. The two figures are standing with crossed legs, in inverted position. Below each of them, under a sort of entablature, a small personage under the aspect of a youth, fills the function of an atlantes and seems to support the whole</page><page sequence="8">170 HÉLÈNE DISERENS construction. At both ends, fixation tenons are seen. The two figures whose general attitude and morphology are very much alike those of the preceding ones also, very obviously, hold their legs crossed, one of them outstretched and the other one folded back. The costumes are equally quite similar to the ones worn by F3 and F4. We however notice that, if the skirt of F5 (on the left in photo- graph 4) presents slanting parallel bands like the one of F4, the skirt of F6 (on the right in photograph 4) seems to be quite free of any design. Although the features of both of the figures are completely effaced, the two young women wear the same half halo of asoka flowers as F4. It must however be noted that a kind of ribbon knot above the right shoulder, near the neck, forms a shorter flap parallel to the shoulder and a longer one reaching down to the elbow - this occurring on the same side for each of the two figures. Figure F5 whose both arms are almost intact seems to carry an oval and flat cushion of lotus flowers which she appears to be presenting by holding it at the bottom and the top. The fore-arms of F6 are missing, the left one presenting a slanting break, while only the elbow mortise can be still seen of the right one. She was perhaps holding a garland of which the rounded part falls back on the top of her legs. The garland bears traces of a kind of stippled design. The jewels are more visible than those of F4: two large rings adorn the ears, a necklace and bracelets adorn the neck and the arms. Above the ankles, the edge of the skirt is bordered by a jutting hem. It is obvious that the Gazan sculptures considered as a whole were part of a temple dedicated to Surya. This is the reason why we quite naturally tried to possibly identify our four female figures as being consorts of the Sun God. A few representations of the hinduist pantheon prove that the strict rules of the religious iconography have not always been ob- served in this so secluded valley. The hypothesis of a false inter- pretation of the vedic and puranic texts which are often allusive could be plausible. Other Surya representations found in the valley - stone bas- reliefs - sometimes show Danda and Pingala at the side of the deity, but we never, until today, have seen any female representations. The hypothesis that our sculptures might be deities not connected with Surya could therefore be advanced, though it too would not lead to an identification.</page><page sequence="9">ÔIX UNPUBLISHED ANTHROPOMORPHIC WOODEN SCULPTURES AT GAZAN Photo 1 : The group of sculptures as it appears behind the cella of the Gazan temple.</page><page sequence="10">HÉLÈNE DISERENS Photo 2: Group formed by the two statues Ml and M2 (on the left, Surya; on the right, probably Surya or one of his attendants).</page><page sequence="11">SIX UNPUBLISHED ANTHROPOMORPHIC WOODEN SCULPTURES AT GAZAN Photo 3 : Group formed by the two female deities F 3 and F4, not identified as yet.</page><page sequence="12">HÉLÈNE DISERENS Photo 4: Group formed by the two female deities F5 and F6, not identified as yet.</page><page sequence="13">SIX UNPUBLISHED ANTHROPOMORPHIC WOODEN SCULPTURES AT GAZAN 171 The bad state of conservation, the absence of conventional attributes and attitudes increase the difficulties of our study. In addition, since these statues do not stand in their original location, they are in a way detached from their religious context, which makes it still harder to identify them. Owing to the vagueness of their attributes, F 3 and F4 are totally mysterious, although we have tried to recognize Parvati in F3 through the fact that the object she is holding could be interpreted as being a very much eroded little Ganesh ! They might even quite simply represent the Devi Docha and Mucha. We can well imagine F5 and F6 standing on each side of a temple entrance. The foliage and asoka flowers lead us to believe that the statues might represent salabhanjika 16 or even yaksi.11 However, what we interpreted as being a gift of flowers in the case of F5 and, perhaps, a garland in the case of F6 suggests that they might be fluvial deities.18 We compared figures F5 and F6 with the stone ones in the Basheshwara Mahadeva temple at Bajaura.19 In spite of the lither attitudes and the absence of attendants and vahana at Gazan, this hypothesis seems plausible; however, at the present state of our knowledge, we prefer not to pronounce a definitive judgment. Are the four pillars with female figures contemporaneous with the two solar statues Ml and M2 ? Dr. G. K. Jettmar-Thakur, a Kulu expert, has, in the course of recent research work, specifically studied not only the techniques of wood carving, but also the social structures of artisanal workshops.20 She thinks that the totality of these sculptures is the product of one single artist who carved these six statues in the same deodar wood. In her opinion, this consider- able work of art was achieved over a long period of time ; this ex- plains the changes in style. We have also looked for comparisons with other sculptures. Our two pillars could be assimilated to two wood salabhanjika of Nepalese origin exhibited in the Indian Museum at Calcutta and dated as 18 Vogel J. Ph., 1929, pp. 201-31 ; Viennot O., 1954. 17 Coomaraswany A. K., 1971; Viennot O., 1954. 18 Voeel J. Ph., 1925, pp. 385-402; Viennot O., 1964. 19 Vogel J.

It is to be noted that Bajaura is situated at about 40 km from Gazan. 20 Publication under preparation.</page><page sequence="14">172 HÉLÈNE DISERENS being of the XVth-XVIth centuries.21 Compared with these, ours are obviously of much older date. Comparison with the fluvial deities of Bajaura also leads us to think that our statues are of anterior date. It however seems illusionary to think that our four female figures could be of the IXth-Xth centuries ! Will it one day be confirmed that they may be dated between the Xth and the Xllth century ? The evident influence of the great late Gupta Indian tradition and the representation of asoka designs - a tree growing at lower altitudes - indicate that exterior elements were brought in from the Gangetic plain and even from farther away. Long before the building of the gorge road, the Beas valley was already part of a road used for trading and cultural exchanges between the Indian plain and the areas on the other side of the Himalaya. The raja's castle mentioned by the Gazan villagers was probably one of the many forts controlling this road. The quality of these Gazan sculptures and their presence in this isolated hamlet of the High Beas Valley will, we hope, mean more than an enriching of the Kulu cultural and artistic heritage. They will perhaps introduce an additional element in the history of the Kulu which presents many gaps in this period. This article in which, in spite of all our efforts, many questions remain without an answer, is but the preliminary to a study which we intend to pursue. 21 Ray A., 1973, p. 44, figg. 69-70.
