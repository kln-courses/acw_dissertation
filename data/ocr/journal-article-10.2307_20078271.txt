<plain_text><page sequence="1">Contesting the Boundaries of Race and Gender in Old Southwestern Humor by Ed Piacentino As has been generally acknowledged, the humor of the Old Southwest has often featured African American and women characters, but most typically in secondary roles. And the portrayal of blacks and women has usually reaffirmed popular nineteenth-century socio-cultural attitudes and assumptions regarding race and gender, thereby sustaining the marginalization of women and blacks. Still, there are a number of tales and sketches in southern frontier humor which seem to challenge, intentionally or unconsciously, the racial and gender status quo. Granted, the authors of southern antebellum humorous pieces were typically con servative gendemen of Whig persuasion who not only publicly sup ported the patriarchal and proslavery stances of the region but also wrote exclusively for a male audience that enjoyed patrician status. Even so, for reasons unknown (though speculations concerning possible moti vation will be addressed in the final sections of this essay), the ante bellum backwoods humorist would occasionally slip from behind the mask, creating situations and portraying characters who through their words and/or actions seemed to exhibit distincdy human attributes. And these qualities did not always coincide with the socio-political dictates of the Old South, which tended to support stereotypical notions con cerning race and gender. Yet in general southwestern humor, according to Stephen Railton, "was a counterattack upon the spirit of times, a deeply rooted motivated repudiation of the contemporary surge of democratic impulses most conveniently represented by Jacksonianism" (ioo). Though writings that challenge racial and gender assumptions, as 116</page><page sequence="2">Contesting the Boundaries 117 some of the southwestern sketches do, may seem subversive, actually they are not as radical as they appear to be. My purpose in this essay will be to show that while selected tales and sketches by John S. Robb, Hardin Taliaferro, Francis James Robinson, George Washington Harris, Sol Smith, and Henry Clay Lewis sometimes deviate from the proscriptive racial and gender politics of their times, the issues raised in the portrai ture of blacks and women would not likely have been offensive to their contemporary readers. Generally, as we will see, the humorous manner in which these writers handled their material and the usually safe, non offensive context in which they treated it often camouflaged or provided a buffer or safeguard for what they were doing. Admittedly, African American characters appear with some frequency in old southwestern humor. Even though virtually every humorist of this school included some black characters, most often their portrayal never transcended the level of stereotypes. In 1958, critic James H. Penrod, in commenting on black portraiture in southern frontier humor, generally and accurately claimed that these humorists "emphasized the stereotyped traits that have prevailed in the minds of Americans for gen erations" ("Minority Groups" 121) and that their roles "were those of comic characters in support of the principal actors" (128). Perhaps the two most prevalent black stereotypes featured in antebellum southern humor are the loyal contented slave and the comic black. Such stereo types, which Seymour L Gross terms the "fantasy construct" (25), are, he points out, "marked by exaggeration or omission" and tend to emphasize "the Negro's divergence from white Anglo-Saxon norms, and are con sciously or unconsciously pressed into the service of justifying racial pro scription" (10). Three southwestern humorists whom I feel made overtures toward contesting the boundaries of race are John S. Robb, printer, reporter, and editor and best known for his association with the St, Louis Reveille and as author of humorous sketches collected in Streaks of Squatter Life and Far-West Scenes (1847); Hardin Taliaferro, Baptist minister, journalist, editor of religious periodicals, and author of a collection of backwoods humorous sketches, Fishers River (North Carolina) Scenes and Characters (1859); and Francis James Robinson, newspaper writer, Georgia county clerk, medical doctor, and author of a volume of humorous sketches, Kups of Kauphy.A Georgia Book in Warp and Woof{\% 53). Robb's "The Pre-Emption Right" features a black slave named Sam, whom critics often simply dismiss as an embodiment of the devoted ser vant stereotype.1 Yet, whether Robb intended it or not, he portrays Sam</page><page sequence="3">ii8 Southern LiteraryJournal as somewhat transcending this stereotype, as being a human being with compassion and capability, even though, as I hope to demonstrate, the author uses various means to attempt to mask this. Though Robb initially portrays Sam as the contented and loyal slave, "who was at once his master's attendant and friend" (118), he further adds that "the bonds of servitude were . . . moulded [sic] into links of friendship and affection, securing to them a feeling of confidence in their lonely habitation in the wilderness" (118). Sam performs two humane and compassionate acts during the course of the tale. The first of these is when Sam, without being commanded to do so, defends a woman from her physically abu sive husband. Indeed a noble gesture, an act beyond the obligatory ser vice to his master, Sam's behavior is more than a chivalrous response to a woman in distress; it is an unselfish display of genuine concern for a person in need of assistance. Expectedly, Robb tries to discount what Sam has done, and in the process even manages through the words of Dick Kelsy, Sam's master, to reduce the significance of the slave's indi viduality as an African American. Therefore, rather than acknowledge Sam's humanity, Kelsy half humorously tells his slave: "Sam . . .you're a nigger, but thar's more real white man under your black skin than could be found in an acre of such varmints as that sucker" (123). Because of Sam's magnanimity, his master, perhaps in a felt sense of obligation, praises Sam but not as a black man, and even goes so far in what be comes almost an automatic piece of rhetoric on the slave's and perhaps the reader's behalf to add, "Give me your fist, old fellar; while Dick Kelsy's got anythin' in this world, you shall share it!" (123). The very choice of words that Kelsy uses to praise his slave seems to denigrate Sam's act of kindness, because what he says attributes whatever qualities the slave possesses to whiteness. Such a gesture on Robb's part, I feel, seems to be done to reaffirm white superiority and thereby to placate his reader who may fear that the author has overstepped his bounds in his portrayal of Sam's humanity. The second occasion reflecting the slave's genuine compassion occurs when he actually saves Dick Kelsy's life after Kelsy, while homeward bound, has been stabbed by the same unfriendly squatter who earlier had assaulted his wife. Even though Robb fore shadows this event early in the tale, noting that Kelsy and Sam "had imbibed a lasting affection for each other,?each would have freely shed blood in the other's defence" [sic] (118), still one gets the impression that Sam's care of his master is not something that he feels obliged to do because Dick is his master. Rather, it seems an act motivated out of sin cere kindness and concern for a fellow human being. In describing Sam's</page><page sequence="4">Contesting the Boundaries 119 administering first aid to his master's wounds, Robb writes: "The faithful negro had staunched the blood, and applied every restorative his rude knowledge could devise.... The natural strength of the patient, together with Sam's careful nursing, soon restored him to his legs" (125). In saving his master's life, Sam becomes more than a faithful retainer, how ever; he shows that he is responsible and fully capable of making right decisions without being forced to do so. In short, what Robb has done here is to create a black character who displays through his humanness a complexity that exceeds the limits of stereotyped portraiture. Even so, Robb fails to sustain Sam at this level of characterization. And perhaps for reasons of political and social expediency, he again casts Sam in the mold of a stereotype, this time as a slave who has no individualizing identity. Thus at the end of the tale, Sam, who becomes a mere exten sion of his master, expresses great delight in Dick Kelsy's triumph over the despicable squatter who not only tried to kill him but also to cheat him of his land claim: "Dat's Massa Dick's signature to his land claim? datisl" (132). An even better illustration of the dynamics that the southwestern humorist uses to undercut the racial politics of the antebellum period, but within an apparent innocuous perspective, is in Hardin Taliaferro's portraiture of the Reverend Charles Gentry, the only black character to whom the author gives a narrative voice in his book, Fishers River. In fact, in the authorial frame to the Reverend Gentry's two folk sermons, Tali aferro displays no condescension or sarcasm in introducing Gentry, an actual slave preacher in Surry County, North Carolina, Taliaferro's birth place and the setting for many of the humorous sketches that comprise Fisher's River. In presenting Gentry, Taliaferro is mainly complimentary, and in the frame, he singles out the slave preacher for such attributes as goodness, cleverness, originality, and the "force of his cataract voice and rail-mauling gestures, if not by argument" (187). Coupled with this, Tali aferro shows respect for and understanding of the revisionist slant of Gentry's theology. In so doing, he closes the frame acknowledging, if only somewhat offhandedly, that Gentry's theory about the origins of the black and white races is as sound as anybody else's: "When men leave the plain teachings of the Bible and go into vague speculations, one man's hypothesis is nearly as good as another's" (187). Gentry's two folk sermons, "The Origin of Whites" and "Jonah and the Whale," contain brief introductions rendered in mainly formal lit erary English, the familiar strategy the southwestern humorist employed to create distance for himself and for his audience from the vernacular</page><page sequence="5">I20 Southern LiteraryJournal voice and the free-wheeling subject matter of the tale. The illusion that Taliaferro creates for his assumed audience of white readers is that of overhearing sermons a black preacher delivers in dialect, in a seemingly deadpan manner, before a congregation of black faithful. While the doc trines Gentry espouses clearly deviate from the more widely accepted and orthodox beliefs contained in the Bible, such distortions afforded Taliaferro's readers amusement and at the same time enhanced their sense of racial superiority. For example, Gentry's inventive views, to quote him, that "Adam, Abel, Seth, was all ob 'um black as jet" (188), clearly challenge beliefs regarding white racial origins that many conser vative white southerners of the 1850s would have likely have held. Such a radical position, given the language Gentry uses to articulate it and the associations of ignorance, illiteracy, inferiority, and primitiveness that African American dialect likely evoked in the minds of a white audience, would have probably been comfortably dismissed as ridiculous but enter taining, and as such amusing and non-offensive. Yet underlying the stereotyped associations the black dialect had con ditioned nineteenth-century white readers to image is a different per spective which would have probably only been noticed and appreciated by a black slave audience who listened to sermons like Gentry's. From the perspective of black slaves who likely heard such sermons, what the black preacher says, and even more so how he says it, seems comically original and liberating, in a sense the expression of an imaginative, yet subversive, black folk viewpoint. Rather than relying on abstract and intellectualized theories concerning the origin of whites, Gentry uses the familiar story from Genesis of Cain's murder of his brother Abel, but enlivens it with a humorously new twist, involving a dialogue between God and Cain. Gentry's God is anthropomorphic, very down to earth in his gestures and language. And the verbal exchanges between Cain and God, as the black slave preacher fabricates them, seem natural, lyrically repetitive, and visual: Cain he kill his brudder Abel wid a great big club?he walk-in-stick ?and God cum to Cain, and say, "Cain! Where is dy brudder Abel?" Cain he pout out de lip, and say, "I don't know; what ye axin' me fur? I ain't my brudder Abel's keeper." De Lord he gits in airnest, and stomps on de ground, and say, "Cain! you Cain! what is dy brudder Abel? I say Cain! what is dy brudder?" Cain he turn white as bleach cambric in de face, and de whole race ob Cain dey bin white ebber since. (188 ? 189)</page><page sequence="6">Contesting the Boundaries 121 In "Jonah and the Whale" Gentry uses an even more expansive, flexible range of language conventions than he did in "The Origin of Whites." Yet this practice would have made an entirely different impres sion on untutored slaves than on white readers. To Taliaferro's contem porary white southern reader, such strategies as repetition and incon gruous comparisons coming from the mouth of an uneducated black preacher would be taken as entertaining and would have reinforced the notion of black inferiority, thereby diminishing the image of Reverend Gentry as well as the credibility of what he says. The black slave's reac tion would have probably been somewhat different. Consider that in Gentry's account of the Jonah story, he creates amusing visual images by employing vivid incongruous comparisons. For example, in Gentry's words, "de Lord he raise a mighty whirlygust, and de ship he rock to and fro like a drunkard man" (190); or, "But bless the Lord! whar Jonah? A great big fish cum up and lick him down like salt?hardly a bug moufful fur sich a big whoppin feller" (190-191). Also, in Gentry's version of this familiar Bible story, we find a dialogue between Jonah and the whale, fea turing the whale's repetitive response to Jonah's question, "Hush yer mouf !" (191) or a similar variation. The black slaves would have probably felt comfortable with Gentry's sermons not only because they were con sciously tailored to their backgrounds and needs and employed folk lan guage which included familiar references they could understand and with which they could identify, but also because the sermons gave the black preacher the opportunity to discover and express his own voice and in so doing to create an original text rather than one endorsed by the white man. Under the surface of Gentry's lively and inventive accounts, "The Origin of Whites" and "Jonah and the Whale," one may find Taliaferro's affirmation and appreciation of the black man's capability as a storyteller and at the same time one may observe the slave preacher as a formidable solidifying and influential force in the black community. A third example of transgressive black portraiture in old south western humor that discernibly challenges, but within relatively safe bounds, the prevailing racial attitudes and assumptions of the antebellum South is Francis James Robinson's "'Old Jack' C?," a tale based on a real-life character who was a hotel waiter in Madison, Georgia (Cohen and Dillingham 377). More so than Robb's "The Pre-Emption Right," Taliaferro's "The Origin of Whites" and "Jonah and the Whale," or any other tale or sketch of southern backwoods humor with which I am familiar, Robinson's "'Old Jack' C?" portrays a slave as the central char acter and prominendy keeps him in the foreground almost continuously</page><page sequence="7">122 Southern LiteraryJournal throughout the sketch. Near the outset, Robinson describes Jack as being "possessed of quick perceptive faculties; a lover of the ridiculous; cun ning and smart" (8 5); in short, he is gifted with qualities that elevate him to a distinctively human level and that enable him to function in a slave holding society in which the black man was regarded as happily inferior and subordinate. Yet even after celebrating Jack's attributes, Robinson, perhaps realizing he may have been too generous in his initial character ization of Jack, abrupdy alters this image, reducing Jack to the restrictive stereotype of the loyal and devoted slave: To the superficial observer, Jack has the appearance of being too impudent for a slave, but those who know him best, and who can thus better appreciate his eccentricities by this knowledge, know him to be an obedient and industrious servant; contented in his sta tion in Ufe, and with not the shadow of a wish to change it. Attached to his master's family, and always acting?not as a mere servant, but as a person deeply interested in all that concerns them?none can be more gay and lively when pleasure is the order of the day; and should sorrow bring clouds, none evince more dis interested grief than/?z?^?thus ready "to laugh with those who laugh, and weep with those who weep"?though, no doubt, like all of his race, he'd rather "be merry than sad." (86) This depiction suggests that Jack has no individualizing identity, his per sonhood being essentially an extension or shadow of the white people who own him. After somewhat crossing the boundaries of racial preju dice in his early description of Jack, Robinson, a staunch and outspoken advocate of slavery, seems to have realized that such an overture might antagonize his southern readers. Perhaps as a gesture of reassurance, Robinson, as we have seen, interjects the stereotype and then offers a lengthy digression espousing the benevolence of slavery: ".Without a care for to-morrow, who but a fool, would sigh and cry to-day? With food and raiment, and comforts of all other kinds necessary, regular hours to work, to eat, to sleep and to play, there is not on the broad earth a hap pier set of mortals than the Uncle Tom's and Aunt Philis's of the South ?the lies and slanders of the fanatics of New and Old England to the contrary notwithstanding!" (87). Robinson even echoes the principle of noblesse oblige, observing that "it is a strong evidence of the humanity of slave-owners, that they every day become more and more rigorous in the exercise of their rights over the person of the slave. Thus endeav oring, by retaining him in the position designed him to occupy, to pre</page><page sequence="8">Contesting the Boundaries 123 vent the certain degradation and often total destruction of the human beings intrusted to his keeping by an all-wise Providence, should they once pass Mason and Dixon's line" (87). This kind of intrusive polemical rhetoric was a commonplace in antebellum southern writing, especially among writers who felt compelled to defend the South's "peculiar insti tution." Despite Robinson's bothersome editorializing, interestingly and impor tandy when he returns to his sketch, his subsequent portrayal of Jack defies the stereotype. His portraiture of the slave shows Jack's enviable capability to manipulate white people through verbal wit and cunning. Though many of Jack's interactions with white people are tempered by humor, still the author's treatment of his black slave does not really con form to the notion that his character is npt human, but is only a stereo type. One of the more interesting anecdotes featuring Jack's ability to dupe a white man focuses on a character named Wills, a Yankee tender foot of Dutch extraction who comes to Georgia from Pennsylvania and is employed by Jack's master as a bartender and superintendent. Taking advantage of Wills' naivete, Jack provides Wills with a gun to kill a cow that he has deliberately overloaded with powder. Yet when Wills, who has not the slightest clue that Jack has duped him, fires the gun, the recoil knocks him down. In describing Wills' humiliation, the victim of a prank a slave has skillfully engineered, Robinson writes, "The musket was unin jured, but it had pirouetted through the air in imitation of a French danseuse, as it passed from Wills to Jack. The latter soon picked himself up, more scared than hurt, and assisted poor Wills to the house, taking good care as he went along to attribute the catastrophe to Will [sic] awkwardness in holding the gun! never once alluding to the outrageous load he had placed in it" (92). While Jack's act emphatically shows his superiority to a white man, suggesting that Jack is smarter than Wills, still the details of the anecdote make clear that the victim is not a white southerner, but an inept northerner. I would argue that what Robinson seems to be doing here in using an outsider as a victim of a slave's prank is Yankee baiting, and thereby possibly a gesture for appeasing his southern white readers. But as "'Old Jack C?" continues, Robinson becomes more daring in his portraiture of Jack's human attributes. In a confrontation with a local white clergyman who reproves Jack for purchasing a botde of whiskey and urges him to give up drinking, Jack shows his intelligence and quick wit by spontaneously fabricating a clever and amusing comeback as a justification for imbibing spirits: "Well, mas John, de fact is, I been thinking ober de matter, an' weighing ob de subject myself, sir: an' hab</page><page sequence="9">124 Southern LiteraryJournal come to dis conclusion; whisky serves my friends very badly, makes 'em fight an' quarrel, lie an' steal, makes man an' wife quarrel and fight, an' I'm gittin old as you say; darfore, sir, I b'lieves it to be my duty to distroy as much of it as I kin while I ?ibl" (94). Again, Jack triumphs; he gets in the last word, this time using his creative faculties to forge in colorful dialect a well-timed, clever, and hilarious response to upstage and ridicule a self righteous and meddlesome clergyman. As Robinson writes, "This was a settler, and our parson turned away, while Jack, with his peculiar wink and smirk of the face, checked over his success in flooring his antagonist" (94). It seems doubtful many of Robinson's white southern readers would have found Jack's retort to be offensive. The humorous dynamics of the anecdote (the fact that the victim deserves the verbal put-down he receives and that this is complemented by the slave's dialect and his witty punch line) work effectively in defusing the potential subversive nature of what of he says. One other instance of Jack's besting a southern white man again occurs when the slave, in his usual good-humored way, astutely exercises his verbal wit. This time Jack's victim is an itinerant peddler, a con artist of sorts popularly known as the "Razor Strop man." Significantly, the Razor Strop man, Robinson insinuates, is disreputable since the wares he tries to sell are not what he promotes them as being. One strategy the peddler customarily uses as he hawks his razor straps through the streets of a town is loudly and repeatedly to exclaim, "a few more left of the same sort?" (95). Later the peddler stops at the hotel for dinner where Jack served as a waiter. And Jack, in serving the peddler his food, turns enter tainer, humorously mocking him publicly by presenting him with a single waffle and exclaiming: "Master, have a square-toe'd warfle, sir? Dont be scared, sir, there's a few more left in the kitchen of the same sorti" (95). Rather than to retaliate angrily or violendy to Jack's prank, "Razor Strop" reacts in a good-natured manner, with an occasional "fit of uncontrollable laughter" (96), and even admits that Jack has gotten the best of him, another indication of Jack's capability. In fact, Jack, Robinson observes, continues to triumph in bouts of verbal wit with the peddler. Yet the crowning touch in Jack's display of verbal ingenuity at the expense of Razor Strop takes place at the tea-table when finding a "cambric needle" on his plate, he inquires of the slave "what does this mean?" (96). In responding, Jack, relying on some well-timed wordplay, says, "Well. Master, I thought you needed sharpening up, and ef you would eat de needle, per haps in de morning you hab more pint about you, for I notice you git ting bery dulll" (96). As the narrator points out, while the peddler had</page><page sequence="10">Contesting the Boundaries 125 "gulled a good many ''white folks'' throughout the country with his 'won derful, magical, tragical razor strops' " (96), he is unsuccessful in getting Jack to buy one. Though Jack wears the mask of a jokester and punster throughout this sequence, he actually shows himself to be keenly per ceptive and practically smart, key weapons in his arsenal in humiliating the peddler. And in so doing, he not only recognizes that this white man is a fraud but independendy opts to take advantage of him through cal culated verbal wit and humor. Craftily delivering a series of humorous puns in rapid succession, Jack launches his final assault on the itinerant peddler's already badly damaged integrity. In Jack's words to the peddler, he exclaims, " 'Dat de strop make everything so sharp, even to the man who sold 'em\ he was 'fraid ob de consequences to himself !' 'De fact is,' continued Jack, 'dem strops makes heap o' people 'cut' dere eye-teeth' jis by lying' on a table in de rooms dey sleeps in, an' I'm 'fraid dey'd make me cut a whole new sett!'" (96-97). To make doubly certain that his reader would not misconstrue Jack's portraiture as being too individualistic and brash, Robinson near the end of the sketch turns once again to editorializing, emphatically defending and reaffirming his own position as a stolid supporter of the system of slavery, an ardent critic of the abolitionists, and finally reiterating that the duty of the slave owner is to care for his slaves. What Robinson says, of course, is pure polemics, and as I see it, a convenient means for overdy providing a rationale for the sketch he has written about Old Jack C. Yet his concluding discourse does more than this. It also may be the author's stratagem for diverting the reader's mind from concentrating too closely on the fact that while he apparently intended to write a story based on the notion that slaves were not fully human, he actually seems to have done somewhat the opposite. In creating Jack C as an intelligent and cun ning human being fully capable of getting along successfully in a world that regarded him as inferior, Francis James Robinson does not, however, insinuate that Jack, with his many attributes, should not be a slave. Rather, he demonstrates through various anecdotes in "'Old Jack' C?" that given what Jack is able to accomplish within the system of slavery without offending the white people whom he comes into contact with, being a slave was not so bad after all. Contesting the restrictions of gender, especially the narrowly circum scribed, marginal existence of women and the limited roles to which women were consigned in nineteenth-century American society, was not uncommon in old southwestern humor. The so-called "cult of true womanhood," which was popular during the first half of the nineteenth</page><page sequence="11">126 Southern LiteraryJournal century, the time period when most of the sketches I will examine were published, professed that a woman should be pious, pure, passive, sub missive, and humble and that she should restrict herself to the domestic sphere (Welter 152). As Barbara Welter notes, "Woman, in the cult of True Womanhood presented by the women's magazines, gift annuals, and religious literature of the nineteenth century, was the hostage in the home" (151). Moreover, in nineteenth-century literature generally and, for the most part, in American literature of this period as well, the por trayal of women, as Cynthia Griffin Wolff points out, was in accordance with "the prevalent social attitude toward women; and since this attitude so often values men and masculine pursuits over women and feminine hobbies, women's concerns seem devalued" (205). Furthermore, a preva lent stereotype of the time was that of the sentimental woman, valued by patriarchal culture for her helplessness, physical weakness, incompe tence, submissiveness, suffering, and emotionality (but only in connec tion with private or domestic domain) (Wolff 210-212). The important scholarship that has already been done on female portraiture in old southwestern humor has challenged somewhat the nineteenth-century ideal of womanhood and has partially refuted the notion acclaiming the "generally acknowledged antifeminine bias in what has been labeled 'native' American humor," visible "not only in the rela tive absence of women as primary humorous characters, but also in their functions as negative stereotypes in masculine humor" (Dressner 138). James H. Penrod, in a pioneering overview on the portrayal of women in nineteenth-century southern frontier humor, observed that the humor ists of this school typically "avoided the stereotypes of womanhood" ("Women" 41); instead of focusing on the rigors of the frontier in respect to women's lives, they "emphasized the more humorous aspects of their life and character" (42). One of the more interesting areas of critical inquiry is the portrayal of women in the Crockett almanacs, "riproarious shemales," as Michael J. Lofaro calls the "half-horse, half alligator" kind of women featured there, women "whose adventures and abilities are sometimes indistinguishable from those of their male counterparts" (135). Tales featuring women in the Crockett almanacs ?the counterpoint to the sentimental woman described previously ?Lofaro persuasively argues, provide both a "clear subtext of the sec ondary status of women by praising traditional roles" and likewise* "break women loose from those confining patterns to act out male adventures and fantasies with a freedom that only life in a wilderness state can allow" (116). Crockett almanac characters like Lotty Ritchers,</page><page sequence="12">Contesting the Boundaries 127 Sally Ann Thunder Ann Whirlwind Crockett (Davy's wife), and Sal Fink, "the Mississippi Screamer," are women whose strength, physical exploits, and independence replicate those of the legendary men also featured in the Crockett tales (Lofaro 13 5).2 William E. Lenz, in a more recent piece of scholarship on the gender dynamics of old southwestern humor, takes issue with the contention of some earlier critics that southern back woods comedy is misogynistic. In his examination of selected sketches from William T Porter's two collections of frontier humor, The Big Bear of Arkansas and Other Sketches (1845) ancl ^ Quarter Race in Kentucky and Other Tales (1847), ne convincingly demonstrates that in a number of these pieces there is "some cultural ambivalence toward women" and that "Southwestern Humorists often picture the relationship between men and women as complicated phenomena" ("The Function of Women" 600). And Lenz, in his revisionist perspective, goes on to show that in some of the sketches that women actually display power, a corrective to the conventional view that southwestern humor "reveals a clear-cut pat tern of male domination and female submission" (599). One significant way that southwestern humorists occasionally chal lenged the popular view of male dominance and female submission was to give women characters voices, providing them with "word power," a weapon of verbal empowerment. A woman with a voice, often an as sertive one, represents a clear deviation from the typical southwestern sketch which tends to suppress women's voices. Sol Smith?a theatrical manager, actor, and author of humorous sketches and anecdotes, many of which were collected in Theatrical Management in the West and South (1868)?in "The Consolate Widow" provides a lively and amusing dem onstration of how female voice empowerment works. In this sketch, a drunken man and his horse have been killed in a quarter race (the race having been occasioned by a wager for a gallon of whiskey), after the horse has run full speed into a building. The authorial or frame narrator, a genteel, sensitive and compassionate observer who is passing through the region just after this disaster has occurred, curiously inquires about what has happened. Unexpectedly, the onlookers seem indifferent. When he asks what will the deceased man's widow feel when she learns of her husband's unfortunate accident, a woman (actually the man's wife though the narrator does not know it at this juncture), coldly responds, "Yes ... it was an unfortunate race. Poor man! he lost the whisky" (Smith 73). This prompts the narrator to ask this woman two additional questions: "Did you happen to know his wife?" and "Has she been informed of the untimely death of her husband?" (73). Then, when the woman to whom</page><page sequence="13">128 Southern LiteraryJournal he has been talking (a woman of few words up to this point) informs him that she is the unfortunate widow, he, noticeably shocked, remarks, "You, madam. You the wife of this man who has been so untimely cut off?" (73). By this time, it has become apparent that the widow, both through her nonchalant manner and callous words, is not a person of sentiment or sensitivity. In fact, so far as she is concerned, the death of her husband is no great personal loss, as her final words to the narrator attest: "Yes, and what about it_Untimely cut off? His throat's cut, that's all, by that 'tarnal sharp end of a log; and as for it's being untimely, I don't know but it's as well now as any time?he warrit of much account, no howl" (74). Her response is, of course, unconventional and shocking. And the image of the widow Smith has created here becomes a blatant denial of the senti mental stereotype. Still, her words (she forthrighdy says what is on her mind) have empowered her, and her final show of indifference reinforces that the widow is exactly the kind of person that she appears to be. As the narrator says, "She resumed her smoking, and we resumed our journey" (74). Although Smith has clearly traversed gender boundaries in "The Consulate Widow" and in doing so may have taken a risk of pos sibly horrifying and alienating a refined reader (the assumed reader being someone perhaps of the same class and background as the authorial nar rator), the words of the widow, we need to remember, are those of an independent frontier woman. And her unorthodox reaction to death clashes with the view of the authorial male narrator, who, obviously more cultured and sophisticated than she, regards her insensitivity as a disgusting social aberration. Because, in all likelihood, the so-called assumed masculine reader of this sketch shares the author's (and autho rial narrator's) combined feelings of revulsion and amusement, and probably because the reader feels superior to and therefore comically dis tanced from the kind of crudity the tale exposes, laughter takes prece dence over indignation. Furthermore, since the incident the story teller has related in the sketch is outrageous as well as ridiculous, the reader is prevented from concentrating too prominendy on the female empower ment Smith's widow exhibits. Another sketch featuring the empowerment of a woman, a woman who challenges the male world by speaking her voice, is "The Curious Widow." Authored by Henry Clay Lewis, a country doctor and sometime writer of backwoods humorous sketches, several published initially in the Spirit of the Times and subsequendy in Old Leaves from the Life of a Louisiana (&lt;Swamp Doctor" (18 50), his only book, "The Curious Widow" begins with a distinctively biased male viewpoint predictably supporting the superi</page><page sequence="14">Contesting the Boundaries 129 ority of men. Dr. Madison Tensas, the narrator, in recalling his medical school days when he boarded with several other medical students at the house of a "curiosity-stricken" widow, opens the sketch with an outright attack on women. In describing the daughters of the landlady, he writes, "the quartette possessing so much of the distinguishing characteristic of the softer sex, that I often caught myself wondering in what nook or corner of their diminutive skulls they kept the rest of the faculties" (Lewis 75). Tensas's and his fellow students' disgust with the widow's excessive nosiness (she examines their personal belongings when they are not in their room) fuels their misogynistic attitude. In retaliation, the stu dents contrive a prank to terrify the widow by sewing the deformed and horrifying face of an albino cadaver to an oil cloth, packaging it in nu merous separate wrappers, and placing it in their room to await her curious tampering. As expected, the widow opens the package as the stu dents secredy watch, but her reaction is not what the students had antic ipated. As she gazes at the deformed and hideous face of the albino, Tensas writes, "She did not faint?did not vent a scream" (Lewis 80). Apparendy entranced by what she has found, she laughs hysterically, incessandy, feigning madness. Her uncontrollable laughter arouses atten tion in the lower quarters of the house and even on the street, attracting the curiosity of onlookers and bewildering the student pranksters who see that their scheme has gone awry. Clearly, the widow has successfully foiled the cruel trick of the students who have not only underestimated her ability but that of women generally. Adhering to what proves to be a false notion regarding male superiority, the students, who seem to have been conditioned to view women stereotypically, are eventually forced to confront the truth behind the widow's mask of pretense, but the full impact is not felt until she berates them verbally before all who have gathered in the room to find out the cause of the commotion and insane laughter. The widow's caustic words become the culmination of what has been a well orchestrated display of histrionics, and the resulting humiliation of the students is an appropriate way to disarm them. In Tensas's words, "the widow ceased her laughter, and, putting on an ex pression of the most supreme contempt, coolly remarked: 'Excuse me, gendemen, if I have caused you any inconvenience by my unusual con duct. I was just smiling aloud to think what fools these students made of themselves when they tried to scare me with a dead nigger's face, when I had slept with a drunken husband for twenty years' " (Lewis 81). As in Smith's "The Consolate Widow," a woman becomes empowered by the words she utters, the end result in Lewis's sketch being shaming and</page><page sequence="15">?o Southern LiteraryJournal embarrassing the foolhardy young men who had tried to hurt her. In get ting the best of her male adversaries, the widow also demonstrates that with age comes experience and that knowledge is power. In fact, it is the revolting knowledge about her past marital life that she employs master fully to her advantage. Yet the widow's verbal attack on the male stu dents, a sharp deviation from the ideals associated with the nineteenth century "cult of true womanhood" and the sentimental stereotype, lacks the essential seriousness to be taken as an outright attack on male domi nation and thereby to offend the male sensibility. As Alan Rose has insightfully recognized in acknowledging how the humor defuses the potential volatility of the widow's brief tirade, "the humorous perspec tive is reasserted in a manner which . . . effectively transforms the dis order into a joke. . . . Equating the hideous Negro face with an everyday source of domestic irritation brings the story from the archetypal to the mundane" (30). In "A Tight Race Considerin' " Lewis, within safe limits, also chal lenges the gender status quo in his portrayal of Mrs. Hibbs, whom her son describes as "a shrewd, active dame, kind-hearted and long-tongued" (43). Mrs. Hibbs, in what turns out to be an impressive display of horsemanship, steps out of her domestic role by triumphing over a new circuit preacher in a horse race, an activity in the southern backwoods usually regarded as a masculine pastime, such as we have seen previ ously in Smith's "The Consolate Widow."3 Yet Mrs. Hibbs, like her father before her, always desired to own a race horse, though it seems doubtful that she would ever actually ever participate in a race had it not been for a prank contrived by her son. As storyteller and therefore the controlling voice of this unconventional episode about his mother, the son shares with Dr. Tensas, the authorial narrator of the frame, his contempt for the preacher, a deserving victim, who, in the son's words, is "a long-legged, weakly sickly, never-contented-onless-the-best-on the-plantation-war-cooked-fur-him sort of man" (48). Unknown to the preacher but known to young Hibbs, the preacher's horse is a former race horse, a situation that Hibbs uses to his advantage to fabricate a race between this horse and colt, the family horse, the latter ridden by Hibbs' mother on her way to church. What seems interesting about all of this is the self-confidence and capability that Mrs. Hibbs exhibits when thrust into a situation where she clearly crosses the boundaries of gender as well as respectability. In the race that ensues between his mother's horse and the preacher's, young Hibbs describes in graphically amusing language the determination, practicality, and skill his mother</page><page sequence="16">Contesting the Boundaries 131 shows in carrying out her strategy to win, a strategy characterized by a touch of the risqu?: She commenced ridin' beautiful; she braced herself up in the saddle, and began to make calkerlations how she war to win the race, for it war nose to nose, and she saw the passun spurrin' his critter every jump. She tuk off her shoe, and the way a number ten go-to-meetin' brogan commenced given' the hoss particular Moses, were a caution to hoss-flesh?but still it kept nose to nose. She found she war carryin' too much weight for Colt, so she gan to throw of plunder, till mithin' was left but her saddle and close. . . . The old woman commenced strippin' to lighten, till it wouldn't been a clean thing for her to have taken off one dud more. (Lewis 52) Furthermore, she criticizes the preacher for wearing spurs, an unfair advantage since she has none to wear herself. Though Mrs. Hibbs ends up winning the race, besting a man in a generally acknowledged mascu line activity, Lewis diminishes her triumph in several ways, perhaps his way of placating his male readers who may have had their male egos humiliated by Mrs. Hibbs' victory. First, she wins but only because her husband assists her by slapping Mrs. Hibbs' horse, thereby frightening it to jump ahead of the preacher's mount. Secondly, the hilarious slapstick antics at the end of the race, in which Mrs. Hibbs is pitched over her horse's head as it slams into the meeting house and she flies through the window, landing naked among the mourners, "her only garment flutterin' on a nail in the sash" (Lewis 5 3), convert her into a laughingstock. In short, Lewis makes Mrs. Hibbs look ridiculous, a victim of embarrass ment (recall she has lost her last stitch of clothing). In what may be regarded as a subde act of male revenge, Lewis, at the tale's end, humor ously sabotages Mrs. Hibbs' accomplishment in the masculine domain of horsemanship, diverting his assumed male's reader's attention by dis crediting a woman's capability through the interjection of a perfectly timed anticlimax. Nancy Walker once observed that "humor is aggressive; women are passive. The humorist occupies a position of superiority; women are inferior" (12). Yet this is typically not demonstrated to be the case in tales of old southwestern humor focusing on courtship that feature female tricksters, who always overstep the traditional boundaries defined by their gender. One of these humorists who effectively portrayed a female trickster is George Washington Harris, best known as a chronicler of the</page><page sequence="17">132 Southern LiteraryJournal folkways and traditions of east Tennessee mountaineers and most signifi candy as the creator of Sut Lovingood, one of the most uninhibited and rascally characters in old southwestern humor. Harris addressed the subject of courtship and occasionally employed sensual women to chal lenge and undermine the prevailing notion of male superiority. In taking this stance, Harris may have been reacting to the narrowly defined roles and capabilities that society had imposed on the women. One of the best demonstrations of how Harris did this without likely arousing adverse reactions from his predominantly male readership may be seen in "Blown up with Soda," published initially as "Sut Lovengood Blown Up" in the Nashville Daily Gazette in July, 1857 and subsequendy in Sut Lovin good s Yarns (1867). In this sketch, Harris humorously shows a male vic timized by a woman primarily because of his own inherent weaknesses. The victim of the prank in "Blown up with Soda" is Sut Lovingood, though the extent to which he suffers as the result of Sicily's trick is negligible and certainly not long term. Sicily embodies in some ways what William E. Lenz sees as Sut's ideal woman, for she possesses in full measure the traits of "sensuality, vitality, and forcefulness" ("Sensu ality, Revenge, and Freedom" 17 3).4 No doubt, as becomes clear to Sut, Sicily is more than just a "handsome girl." And this is what gets him into trouble in his awkward attempt to win her favor, for he assumes that she is as attracted to him as much as he is to her. But this is not the case, and because of the absence of mutual feeling and attraction, Sut makes him self vulnerable to Sicily's prank, an action that gains her much personal amusement at Sut's expense. Because Sut on this occasion is primed for physical love and assumes that Sicily is as well, she has no difficulty in convincing him that the soda powder, which she entices him to take, is a love potion the effects of which will give him a new sensation. While it appears that the power reversal resulting from the success ful execution of Sicily's prank contradicts the familiar assumption in nineteenth-century American culture that the male is superior and that he usually obtains what he desires when women are involved, the humorous style of Sut's monologue (he describes the events of the tale retrospectively) actually creates a different impression, thus restoring the balance of power in Sut's favor. Milton Rickels, in the first book-length study of Harris's work, offers a partial and somewhat generalized expla nation of Sut's re-empowerment, focusing on Sut's amusingly graphic description of his departure from Sicily's presence as the soda powder foam streams from his nose and mouth. According to Rickels, "by telling the joke, Sut objectifies it, reduces its power to crush; instead, he turns it</page><page sequence="18">Contesting the Boundaries 133 back into the fun it began with for Sicily. By his ability to see the comedy as well as feel the disappointment of his life, Sut expresses the power of humor to restore the balance of existence after defeat" (50). What Rickels implies here is that as a jokes ter, as a comic raconteur, Sut has found an effective way to play down Sicily's embarrassing emasculation of him by redirecting the reader's attention from a woman's capabilities in capitalizing on a man's vulnerability to focusing instead on his own ludicrous manner of description. But I would contend that Harris actually places Sut in the role of humorous raconteur much earlier in the narrative than Rickels acknowl edges; in fact, almost from the moment Sut begins to describe Sicily's duplicitous plan to snare him. For example, in describing how Sicily's kiss, a gesture to hold his interest so that she can entice him to take the soda powder, affects him, Sut employs humorously incongruous visual com parisons: "My toes felt like I wer in a warm krick wif minners a-nibblin at em; a cole streak wer a racin up an' down my back like a lizzard wif a tucky hen arter 'im" (Harris 72). Also, shortly after Sut consumes the soda powder, and Sicily mockingly taunts him, telling him, "Hole hit down, Mister Lovingood! Hole hit down! Hits a cure fur puppy luv" (73), Sut craftily diverts the focus of humor from himself to Sicily: "Now warnt that jis the durndes' onreaonabil reques' ever on o'man mad ove man? She mo?t jis es well ax'd me to swaller my hoss, an' then skin the cat on a cob-web" (74). The class differences between Sut and Harris's assumed readers, likely educated gendemen, were vastly different. For that reason, they would have found amusement in how Sut said something in such passages rather than in the social ramifications of a woman daring to cross gender lines. Moreover, as Sicily is obviously lower class and lacking in cultural refinement, Harris's contemporary readers would not have found her emasculation of Sut to be personally threatening. And finally, there is the matter of the sequel to "Blown up with Soda," "Sicily Burns's Wedding." In the sequel, the fact that Harris allows Sut to exact painful vengeance against Sicily through a prank of his own, coercing the Burns's bull into a beehive which causes the bees to swarm and sting everybody, including Sicily and her new husband, afforded the author the opportunity to restore the gender status quo, reaffirming the societal standard of male superiority. Several pertinent questions arise out of this extended analysis of selected texts of old southwestern humor, texts that discernibly contest the restrictive and biased portraiture of race and gender. Why do these texts do what they do? Were their authors consciously aware that they</page><page sequence="19">134 Southern LiteraryJournal were defying convention? If they were cognizant of what they were doing, then why were they being rebellious? Of what significance was their transgression, deliberate or unintentional, of prevalent attitudes endorsed by southern society? And lastly, how might one account for these humorists' ambivalence in characterization and attitude? Regard ing authorial intention, it is difficult, if not impossible, to provide a definitively accurate response because litde evidence, if any, exists to determine explicidy and precisely the writer's purpose. Moreover, to account for the transgressive nature of their work with a single simple explanation is both risky and irresponsible. Having raised these quali fications, we may offer several tentative explanations for what the humorists we have examined here may have been doing. In their deviations, which feature both transgressive content as well character portraiture, these frontier humorists plainly violated prominent nineteenth-century societal assumptions and attitudes regarding race and gender. In doing so, Robb, Taliaferro, Robinson, Smith, Lewis, and Harris were, it is important to understand, first and foremost humorists who wrote numerous sketches that showcase comical incongruity, thereby accentuating deviations from accepted norms, standards, and expectations of nineteenth-century society. And as humorists, their major objective was to entertain an assumed audience of men, often by exaggerating situations and the actions of characters to effect surprise, a sudden reversal of expectations, and sometimes even shock. Therefore, at least on one level, the subversive nature and purpose of humor of the backwoods variety they were employing may offer a partial rationale for their transgressive depiction of race and gender. Secondly, several of these humorists, such as John S. Robb and Sol Smith, were not born in the South, and both they and southern-born Henry Clay Lewis did not always feel compelled to adhere stricdy to southern assumptions regard ing black inferiority or conventional notions about the subservience of women. Robb, the author of "The Pre-Emption Right," and Smith, the author of "The Consolate Widow," were born in the North, traveled widely, and as a consequence did not establish solid southern roots, a factor which likely prevented them from becoming sympathetic with southern attitudes and convictions on race and gender. At different times, in fact, Robb, a printer, reporter, and editor by trade, resided in Philadelphia, Detroit, New Orleans, St. Louis, and California; and Smith, a cosmopolite of sorts, worked as a roving actor and stage manager in the small towns of the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and places in the lower South, such as Mobile and New Orleans. Perhaps because both</page><page sequence="20">Contesting the Boundaries 135 were transients, Robb and Smith were expectedly outsiders, never actually becoming a part of the southern frontier community, or any community for that matter. Because neither established close southern communal ties, they could more comfortably take liberties in their portraiture of blacks and women. Moreover, Lewis?a Charlestonian by birth and the author of "The Curious Widow" and "A Tight Race Considerin' "?has been acclaimed by a recent critic of his work as a "serious writer" who placed a high premium on his art and who dared to use his humorous writing to examine "the disturbed, the deformed, and the dispossessed, the physical and psychological 'monsters' who inhabit the borderlands between solid earth and liquid swamp, and between the rational world and the world of madness" (Arnold xiv). And by critical consensus, Lewis has usually been acknowledged as an upstart, a subversive who had an independent and individualistic personality. Like Robb and Smith, Lewis was somewhat of an outsider as well, never closely sharing in the attitudes and beliefs of the people of northeastern Louisiana where he briefly practiced medicine (Cohen and Dillingham 416), and as such, he seems to have felt free to satirize, among other things, the patriarchal narrow-mindedness and racial conservatism of the region. While Hardin Taliaferro, Francis James Robinson, and George Wash ington Harris were all avowed conservatives and pro-southern in their convictions, each, from time to time, did stray outside the bounds of conventionality, portraying in selected sketches blacks and women who do not stay within the marginalized behavioral molds into which they were expected to fit. Characters like Taliaferro's Reverend Gentry, Robinson's Old Jack C, and Harris's Sicily Burns are outspoken, individ ualistic, clever, and demonstrably capable. In short, these characters rep resent a level of ability and achievement that one would not have expected to see in sketches authored by loyal southern traditionalists. While Robinson objected vehemendy to northern criticism of and inter ference in southern life, he concluded his book of humorous sketches Kups of Kauphy by noting the South's constitutional right to follow a lifestyle that they deemed appropriate (Cohen and Dillingham 376). He also advocated verisimilitude in character portraiture (advice he practiced himself) and noted in particular that characters should be allowed to speak in their own voices: "Wherever it has been possible, we have let our characters use their own language in portraying their individuality^. No painter desirous of success, or escaping righteous censure, would dare leave an ugly feature in a portrait, or ignore a gnarled and crooked oak in a landscape" (vi). Desiring then, as he says, "to be true to nature" (vi),</page><page sequence="21">136 Southern LiteraryJournal Robinson would sometimes allow his characters the liberty of not only speaking in their own voices but also of saying what conceivably was really on their minds. At least in his public life as a Baptist minister and editor of Baptist periodicals, Taliaferro, like Robinson, may not have been as cautiously orthodox in his racial attitudes as he apparently in tended to be. In 1869, Taliaferro was among only a few white ministers in Alabama who responded to the appeal of the Home Mission Society of Boston, an organization widely despised by southern Baptists, to aid in the training of black candidates for the Baptist ministry. In fact, of the small minority who volunteered, Taliaferro was one of three ministers actually appointed to undertake this responsibility. And between 1869 and 1873, ne seems to have carried out this duty diligently and even helped to organize the first Baptist State Convention for black Ala bamians (Piacentino 257). No records exist to indicate exacdy how his fellow southern white ministers and the white Baptist faithful regarded Taliaferro's active role in the ministerial training of blacks. In all likeli hood, they either condemned and ostracized him because of his willing ness to help the newly freed slaves, or they were indulgent toward his work with blacks because they may have regarded it as paternalistic. My guess is that the first possibility is nearer to what may have actually occurred, for in 1873, Taliaferro, who had lived in Alabama and had served as a Baptist minister there for thirty-eight years, abruptly and without explanation, left the state and returned to Loudon, Tennessee, where he still had family connections (257). This same ambivalence can also be seen in Harris. Despite his avowed pro-southern attitudes and politics, Harris, as we have seen, was not totally consistent and therefore did not always conform to traditional notions regarding female portrai ture in his humorous sketches. Whether or not the southwestern humorists whose sketches we have explored here deliberately intended to contest the parameters which defined the racial and gender status quo is an issue that may never be adequately resolved. Still, what they did in this area was significant, even though they were severely handicapped by a repressive social climate, conservative racial politics, and the patriarchal circumstances of the times. My personal feeling is that Robb, Taliaferro, Robinson, Smith, Lewis, and Harris?all writers only by avocation?did not always con sciously try to limit how they portrayed some of their marginal charac ters. But if perchance they became aware that they may have gone too far in delineating humanness in their portraiture of African Americans and women, they probably allowed socio-political considerations to</page><page sequence="22">Contesting the Boundaries 137 influence their decisions concerning how they would ultimately handle these potentially controversial materials in their work. And this may help to account for the claim of ambivalence in their handling of character ization and situation. Perhaps desiring to comply with the political and social attitudes of their male audience, their subliterary sketches, despite the occasional transgressions in the portraiture of blacks and women, ultimately defended, if only in a roundabout way, the prevalent southern views on race and gender. What has been said of Thomas Bangs Thorpe, the author of "The Big Bear of Arkansas," in this context may likewise be applicable to the backwoods humorists whose sketches we have discussed: "Since he was not prepared to challenge the expecta tions of his audience, he ultimately had to confirm their prejudices" (Railton 99). Like their contemporary, William Gilmore Simms?who in his 183 5 novel The Yemassee created in the African-American slave Hector a char acter whose human qualities plainly contradicted southern assumptions and beliefs that a black man was subordinate and subhuman, but whose humanity his creator subsequendy clumsily tried to destroy by recasting the slave in the mold of a stereotype (Rubin 1012-1014)?these writers found themselves from time to time in a quandary. Realizing that they had veered outside the comfort zone in their portraiture of African Americans and women, and therefore may possibly offend their mascu line readership, they seemed to have been willing to compromise what artistic integrity that they may have exerted in honest and consistent character portraiture by submitting to the demands of political and social expediency. Indeed, as we have seen, southwestern humorists like John S. Robb, Hardin Taliaferro, Francis James Robinson, Sol Smith, Henry Clay Lewis, and George Washington Harris, in their portrayal of African Americans and women, did occasionally create characters who take on human dimensions contrary to the views of nineteenth-century southern society. And like Simms, and also to a certain extent like Joel Chandler Harris, Charles W Chesnutt, George Washington Cable, Mark Twain, and other southern writers who were their immediate literary succes sors, many of the southwestern humorists had to face the dilemma of whether they should be true to their integrity as writers (albeit all of them were amateurs in the profession of authorship) or should be loyal to the popular convictions regarding race and gender epoused by and conso nant with the southern communities where most of them resided or about which they treated in some of their humorous works. Thus the southern frontier humorist who may have found himself portraying</page><page sequence="23">138 Southern LiteraryJournal blacks and women as human beings, freeing them from demeaning stric tures by giving them flexibility they rarely enjoyed in real life in the ante bellum South, and showing them to be compassionate, caring, brave, smart, manipulative, resourceful, individualistic, self-expressive, capable, shrewd, and witty ultimately failed to sustain their humanity. Yielding to the expectations of his assumed audience of conservative male readers, the southwestern humorist always seemed to find ways to make certain that his sketch or tale featuring blacks or women remained within a non controversial framework. In every sketch we have examined, the writer cautiously skirted potential sociopolitical controversy, creating built-in concessions or useful diversionary tactics through such means as the dynamics of humor, inconsistent characterization, the manipulation of his audience's feelings through sentimental language and gestures, and even overt editorializing. While these humorists occasionally did, inten tionally or unintentionally, find themselves at variance with the racial and gender politics of their times, it would not be until the twentieth century that southern writers of the likes Faulkner, Warren, Porter, Welty, and Wright, among numerous others, who felt that they could stand apart from their community and its loyalties and prejudices, would confidendy and audaciously traverse the boundaries of race and gender to portray African Americans and women with graphic honesty and complexity. NOTES i. See Penrod, "Minority Groups in Old Southern Humor" 123, and Rose, Demonic Vision iz. 2. Lofaro further claims that these "shemales ... are at least in part the result of the projected comic fantasies of eastern male writers who saw the frontier as an almost equal opportunity experience regardless of the sexual stereotypes and roles" (146). 3. Arnold, in speaking of male-female relations in "A Tight Race Considerin'," sees Mrs. Hibbs, the mother, as the "dominant figure," who "in the throes of excitement... divests herself of clothes, of religion, of propriety, and inspires the other women in the church to do the same. Thus the church is paganized; the Christian service (a funeral) becomes a bacchanalia, and the men flee from the nakedness?and the implied sexual ferocity?they see in the women" (xxxvi?xxxvii). 4. Lenz goes on to note that Harris's women characters realize that "sex is a power before which men are helpless" and that this "suggests a tradition of Ameri can women characters who flaunt their inheritance in a popular male-dominated genre, one that Harris had the good fortune to discover and exploit" (179).</page><page sequence="24">Contesting the Boundaries 139 WORKS CITED Arnold, Edwin T.
