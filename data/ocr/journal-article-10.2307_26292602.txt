AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL APPROACH ABSTRACT: The use of models gained in research concerning primate behaviour or human sociobiology is common in the creation of environmental concepts in paleoanthropology. This usage, however, produces the risk of anthropomorphistic interpretation of ecological and sociobiological situations regarding the human ancestry. To reject those models is often not possible. One has to ensure that these models are indicated and their metaphorical nature is respected. This does not mean that paleoanthropology is not an exact science, as theory is underdetermined in every science as well as, for example, in physics. KEY WORDS: Paleoanthropology – Scientific methods – Behavioural models – Epistemology INTRODUCTION put it, are giving the context to the research on human evolution. Especially in behavioural ecology they seem to In the second half of the 19th century Friedrich Nietzsche be used as a direct metaphor for human behaviour. Figure 1 (1973) stated that truth is an army of flexible metaphors gives an interesting example for anthropomorphism in and anthropomorphisms. Thus he made the important point primatology, showing apes as comic-characters ascribing that truth is both relative to a theoretical system applied as a clearly human chain of thought to a gorilla. Figures of well as to extrinsic factors such as e. g. history and language. this kind are included in a number of publications regarding In the 20th century a rich tradition of epistemological social and intelligent behaviour in apes or sociobiology approaches evolved discussing the movements of the (e.g. Byrne 1995, Sommer 1992). The critical attitude metaphors called "truth". It is easy to comprehend that a towards the visualisation of logical thinking in apes should science as paleoanthropology is highly depending on not be misinterpreted as a negative attitude against the theoretical constructs and coherent concepts. This is due logical and perceptional abilities which are surely present to the fact that the empirical basis is sparse and consists in apes. But the illustration shows how an attempt to mainly of the fossil record which can only give an extremely transport a certain idea, which is at first glance very limited impression of the lebenswelt of ancient times. reasonable, can easily end up in an anthropomorphism which cannot be verified by scientific method.

From an epistemological point of view the range of information gained on the basis of this parallelism is quite Underdetermination of scientific theory surprising. One always has to bear in mind that the role of The thesis of the underdetermination of scientific theory is monkeys and apes as a parallel model is due only to their one of three major theses to be found in the thinking of evolutionary kinship with humans, viz. the fact of a Williard Van Orman Quine, who starting as logician became common ancestor. Many factors influencing the behaviour an eminent figure in the language philosophy and such as habitat, group size, group organisation etc. differ epistemology in the second half of the 20th century. Quine clearly. (1990) himself sees the thesis concerning empirically There surely is a possibility or even a need to use the equivalent theories as a recurring theme of his philosophy. empirical results of primatology in human behavioural The main point of Quine's thesis is that natural science is ecology. But the questions must be carefully formulated empirically underdetermined due to the fact that scientists and the concepts and theoretical background must be well have to invent hypotheses in order to be able to explain defined and explicitly mentioned (Quiatt, Reynolds 1993). some phenomena or to predict certain events (Quine 1975). The power of the described parallelism has to be weighed Explanation and prediction are both crucial aspects of against the scientific slack of using a method of conjecture. modern science situated beyond the observational basis of But as a matter of fact progress in paleoanthropology science. can only be achieved by interpreting the data available, Quine (1992) holds that it is possible to form two theories even if that means making up a story of humanisation. The which are empirically equivalent, but logically history of Homo, which is mostly a biological history, incompatible. Schematically one has to imagine a set of cannot be told without assumptions. It would be most possible observations E, which can be used as the basis of astonishing if results in evolutionary biology could be two sets of theoretical formulations T1 and T2. Both, T1 and presented without recurrence on an ecological background; T2, are perfectly concise interpretations of E, but are as well as it would be surprising if an ecological analysis incommensurable. This may even lead to the situation in zoology could be done without the examination of the meaning that T1 contains the sentence a, while –a (the behaviour of the taxa in question. negations of sentence a) is member of set T2.

In One might argue that one of the crucial premises of the Quine's point of view this fact means a big chance for the argument is wrong and hold that theories are in no sense of scientific enterprise: the word interpretations, but are a direct outflow of "Suppose again two rival systems of the world, equally observations and are just true in an absolute sense of the sustained by all experiences, equally simple, and word.

It is important not to misinterpret Quine's position as The world, to put it in the words of Goodman (1978), is anti-realistic. Nature is in Quine's (1992) view not just a full of versions of itself. One has to bear in mind that convention but does really exist.

Nevertheless the possibilities of This leads practically to a form of conventionalism, but invention have to be more limited in science. does not imply ontologically that there is nothing to be This does also apply to a science as paleoanthropology, right or wrong about (Quine 1992).
