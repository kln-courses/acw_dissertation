<plain_text><page sequence="1">History of Religions (There is a brief reference to the Redfield "big" and "little" culture model, but this is undeveloped.) As such the Blums' work is still wedded to the ahistorical presuppositions and methods of the older quest for survivals. Until we can define with precision what a tradition is and isolate the bearers of tradition we are left with a series of apparently chance parallels without the means of determining their significance. Some of the material collected by the Blums point in a preliminary way to the solution of some of these questions. I was struck by their observation that non-Christian elements predominate in the accounts, that specifically Christian motifs are "least familiar to the villagers" (pp. 183 f.); and by their careful distinction between the varied history and ethnic backgrounds of the four villages and between the kinds of material collected from different families within these villages (pp. 174-195, 264 f.). If this sort of rudimentary sociological analysis had been pressed and if the sources of the various narratives had been carefully specified in terms of this analysis, then we might have advanced in our understanding of tradition and situation at least to the point of comparable studies in African witchcraft (e.g., M. G. Marwick, Sorcery in its Social Setting [1965]). This will not solve the important hermeneutic or theoretical questions which remain, given the overall functionalist orientation of the authors. But, as the important anthology edited by Mary Douglas, Witchcraft Confessions and Accusa- tions (1970) demonstrates, such careful analysis is the precondition for such theoretical questioning and the development of new directions. GREEK FUNERARY PRACTICES Greek Burial Customs. By DONNA C. KURTZ and JOHN BOARDMAN. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1971; London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1971. Pp. 384. $9.75. Historians of religion have long been interested in Greek and Roman funerary remains as a deposit of religious symbolism and as evidence of classical views on the nature of life, death, immortality, and afterlife. The pioneering studies of J. J. Bachofen, Versuch iiber die Grdbersym- bolik der Alten (1859), Die Unsterblichkeitslehre der orphischen Theologie (1867), and Romische Grablampen (1890)-now available with valuable commentaries in the magnificent edition of Bachofen's Gesammelte Werke edited by K. Meuli (Vols. IV and VII)-were continued by other scholars, especially F. Cumont, Afterlife in Roman Paganism (1922), Recherches sur le symbolisme funeraire des Romains (1942), Lux Perpetua (1949); A. Brelich's provocative and frequently neglected monograph, Aspetti della morte nelle iscrizioni sepolcrali dell'impero romano (1937), and E. R. Goodenough's magisterial, comparative opus, Jewish Symbols in the Greco-Roman Period (1953-1970), Vols. I-XIII. Such studies have, on the whole, emphasized the literary and epigraphical texts as a 185</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews key to interpretation or employed an iconographical-symbolic system reconstructed by comparison and by a juxtaposition of textual and iconic materials. History of Religions has tended to ignore the 'nuts and bolts' archae- ological discoveries and the sometimes bold theories that have been advanced to account for them (e.g., V. G. Childe, "Directional Changes in Funerary Practices during 50,000 Years," Man [1945]). This has led to an unfortunate bifurcation in interpretation-the historian of reli- gions has tended to use funerary materials as evidence for a symbolic interpretation; the archaeologist, as evidence for a pragmatic one. This difference may be illustrated by one passage from the eminent classicist, Rhys Carpenter: "when [prehistoric] burials are unearthed in which the corpses have been contracted into 'foetal attitude,' with knees drawn up under chins, there are those who speak of symbolic re-entry into the maternal womb; whereas the excavating archaeologist, having some notion of the labor attendant on digging holes in hard and stony or per- haps tightly frozen ground, contents himself with reflecting how he too might constrict a dead body into the smallest possible compass if he were obliged to dig a hole in which to bury it!"' This bifurcation has been explicitly addressed by Kurtz and Boardman in their Greek Burial Customs, which is a volume in the magnificent new series, "Aspects of Greek and Roman Life" edited by H. H. Scullard (I shall review at a later date the companion volume by J. M. C. Toynbee, Death and Burial in the Roman World). Kurtz and Boardman begin their study by noting: "Over the last century excavation has revealed new sources of information ... and these have been partially exploited-only partially, because the interests and idiom of the archaeologist and the student of religion have seldom been at one. In fact, archaeology can add little to our understanding of what the Greeks thought about death.... It can tell us a very great deal about what they did about death" (p. 17). After a brief survey of 1 R. Carpenter, "Archaeology," in J. S. Ackerman and R. Carpenter, Art and Archaeology (1968), p. 119. The symbolic interpretation is largely based on ethno- graphic parallels-see the important methodological critique by P. J. Ucko, "Ethnography and Archaeological Interpretation of Funerary Remains," World Archaeology, I (1969) and P. J. Ucko and A. Rosenfield, Paleolithic Cave Art (1967), chaps. II-V. On the particular issue of the return to Mother Earth, see the im- portant critique of A. Dieterich's classic monograph, Mutter Erde, 3d ed. (1925) by O. Pettersson, Mother Earth (1967). Ucko, likewise, offers an important correc- tive to the pattern of Mother Earth and Maternal Goddesses in his groundbreaking survey, Anthropomorphic Figurines (1969). Kurtz and Boardman frequently offer a pragmatic interpretation of a religious custom, e.g., "The fear of pollution was only one reason for keeping the main cemeteries outside a town: land within an occupied area, especially if it was walled, was too valuable to waste on the dead" (pp. 188 f.). The authors note that this interpretation does not apply to the in- junction against burial in a sacred enclosure and refer to the fine article by W. Vollgraff, "Inhumation en terre sacr6e dans l'antiquite grecque," Memoires presentees ac l'Academie des inscriptions, XIV (1951)-but they have not inquired as to the degree to which the walled city itself might be regarded as a sacred en- closure. 186</page><page sequence="3">History of Religions Mycenaean material (pp. 21-28), they have adopted a twofold division for the presentation of their data. In the first part (written largely by Kurtz), they have followed a strict chronological order, presenting Athenian and Attic material from the Bronze Age through the Hellenis- tic period (pp. 29-169). In the second part (chiefly Boardman's respon- sibility), a topical organization is followed in a less systematic survey of practices from the rest of Greece and the colonies (pp. 170-376). The exposition is complemented by a well-chosen set of clear photographs and sketches and a rich set of bibliographic notes. The authors have stayed largely within the confines of the archaeolog- ical approach and have refrained from offering any interpretation of symbolism. Occasionally they make reference in their notes to important articles on symbolism, but more frequently they content themselves with references to such general handbooks as H. Mobius's invaluable, Die Ornamente der griechischen Grabstelen (1968). Thus the historian of religions will be frustrated by tantalizing reports such as "funerary offerings of eggs, either real or imitations in stone or clay, were common in Greece" (p. 77). The authors cite M. P. Nilsson's classic study, "Das Ei im Totenkult der Alten," Archiv fiir Religionswissenschaft, XI (1908), but venture no interpretation of the meaning of these offerings or assessment of Nilsson's treatment. This stems, in part, from their gen- eral thesis that "although most Greek burial customs can be related to those practiced by other peoples at other times, we have the impression that by the Classical period their significance has been largely forgotten" (p. 332)! Of interest to the historian of religions will be their excellent, sum- mary chapters on Greek funeral rituals (pp. 142-161, 200-217) as well as a number of important observations, for example, their denial of a Mycenaean cult of the dead (p. 22), their noting of the rarity of in- humation in "foetal position" and careful listing of exceptions (p. 71; cf. pp. 192, 308), their denial of the significance of the tree as a burial marker (p. 189), their insistence on the antiquity of the funeral lament (pp. 27 f., et passim.). Perhaps their most important contribution is their establishment of the simultaneous presence of inhumation and cremation from Mycenaean times on, and their repeated argument that the choice of one mode or another "seems to have been a matter of per- sonal or family preference" (pp. 51, et passim.). This complicates in a helpful way the attempt to utilize these two modes of disposal of dead as clues to distinctive cultural strata which has plagued classical studies for generations.2 Greek Burial Customs is valuable for the historian of religions in that it forces him to recognize a more diffuse and variegated picture than he 2 See the parallel development in Roman studies, e.g., A. D. Nock, "Cremation and Burial in the Roman Empire," Harvard Theological Review, XXV (1932); G. Dumezil, Archaic Roman Religion (1970), Vol. I, pp. 62-64 (an excellent sum- mary). 187</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews has hitherto presupposed, but as the authors note: "the differences hold more to interest the excavator and archaeologist than the historian of religion" (p. 170). This complication is a necessary propadeutic to interpretation, but the hermeneutic task has yet to be undertaken. JONATHAN Z.

The discipline to which this journal is dedicated, the history of religions, has always stressed the importance of the study of symbolism. Actually, this study is an essential factor of the hermeneutics in this field as it is conceived by the scholars who have shaped its recent history. In the last two decades, there has been a growing interest in the study of symbolism in Central Europe, and the dominating editorial initiative is, at present, a major bibliographical enterprise. The editor, Manfred Lurker, himself a well-known scholar and author in the study of symbolism,1 has dedicated the greater part of his time and labor in the last few years to a work which renders a valuable service to all branches of study in this field. His work has appeared in two phases: first, in the years 1964-68, he edited the Bibliographie zur Symbolkunde,2 and then, beginning in 1968, he continued by publishing a yearbook under the title Bibliographie zur Symbolik, Ikonographie und Mythologie.3 In his preface to the first of the two bibliographies, Lurker stresses the fact that "more perhaps than any other discipline, the study of symbolism transcends the limits of scholarly specialization and tends 1 He has published Symbol, Mythos und Legende in der Kunst (Die symbolische Aussage in Malerei, Plastik und Architektur) (Baden-Baden, 1958); Der Baum in Glauben und Kunst (unter besonderer Beriicksichtigung der Werke des Hieronymus Bosch) (Baden-Baden/Strasbourg, 1960); Symbole der alten Agypter (Einfiihrung und kleines W6rterbuch) (Weilheim, 1964); and many articles. At present he is working on a dictionary of biblical symbols. 2 Manfred Lurker, Ferdinand Hermann, Eckhard Unger, et al., eds., Biblio- graphie zur Symbolkunde, Bibliotheca Bibliographica Aureliana, vols. 12, 18, 24 (Baden-Baden: Heitz, 1964, 1966, 1968). 3 Contributors at present: J.
