<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPINOZA IN ENGLAND, 1665-1730 * ROSALIE L. COLIE Department of History, Wesleyan University I. THE PLATONIC PATTERN OF RECEPTION IN MANY ways unfortunately for them, Spi- noza's works reached an England already armed against both heterodoxy and "atheism," fully exercised in the heavy engagements with Descartes and, later, Hobbes.1 Spinoza's impact on late seventeenth-century thought in England was therefore weakened by his readers' assumption that in him they were simply dealing with an extreme Hobbist. All the same, even in the din of the Hobbist controversies, Spinoza's work could not go entirely unnoticed; though he was often shrugged off as a mere disciple of the sage of Malmesbury, his work dismissed as the natural spawn of Hobbist error, Spinoza ultimately en- gaged intellectual attention as a figure of note in his own right. At first, Spinoza had the distinc- tion of being regarded, in that age of intolerant divines, as a "true" atheist: to the orthodox of various Christian confessions, it was clear that Spinoza was a communicant of no church, and that he had been forcibly ejected from the Jewish com- munity into which he was born.2 Although Spinoza aroused the violent opposi- tion of such relatively gentle men as Henry More, the Platonist, and John Howe; and though he met the intransigent opposition of Ralph Cudworth and Richard Baxter; and though throughout the early eighteenth century he was continually the object of careful and careless refutation, there were signs, even before the end of the seventeenth cen- tury, of deference to his ideas and even to his method.3 Very gradually, Spinoza came to seem less Hobbist, more respectable, more theistic; sometimes he was honored by men whose praise would have surprised him-until in the nineteenth century Samuel Taylor Coleridge,4 Matthew Arnold, George Eliot, George Henry Lewes, and James Anthony Froude could and did, for their various reasons, turn him into a kind of intellectual culture-hero.5 The transformation is an interesting one: some- times Spinoza's thought was accommodated to the most austere canons of enlightened rationalism and sometimes to the most transcendent arrange- ments of romantic ideas. He became an authority both for programs very different from each other, and for programs genetically very different from his own. An historical consideration of the reac- tion to Spinoza in English thought from the publi- cation of the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus in * The work for this study was undertaken through the generosity of the Folger Library, which granted me a fellowship for summer study; and finished on the bounty of the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation.

Deane, who laboriously read the essay in an early draft; Maurice Goldsmith, who read every word and quarreled with enough words to make better sense of them all; Miss D. F. Serlin and Miss M. R.

SOC. 1670 through the first third of the eighteenth cen- tury carries with it some real advantages. In the first place, because reaction to Spinoza is more isolable than reaction to Descartes or to Hobbes on the one hand, or than reaction to Locke or to Newton on the other, it supplies us with mate- rials for a genuine study of that most elusive phenomenon, the gradual secularization of thought, from the late seventeenth century to the mid- eighteenth century. Taking the Enlightenment at its own evaluation, we have always assumed that it was the secularization of western thought: but the actual process of that secularization is hardly clear or distinct; to students of late seventeenth- century writings, the generalizations have too often seemed at one time both true and too true to be true. In the consistently religious platonic reaction to Spinoza, we can see in operation the broad- Church response to the danger he posed, a re- sponse that in propagandist wisdom if in philo- sophic error perceived in Spinoza the intellectual bedfellow of that rascal, Thomas Hobbes. In the opposition of Robert Boyle to Spinoza, a mind of quite another dimension was at work-though not at its forte; in their turn, Boyle's lecturers, men with the same aims and orientation as his, provide a self-limiting series of reactions to Spinoza, as well as to other phases of intellectual life. From the slow secularization of their handling of Spi- noza's ideas and-more telling-the grounds from which they refuted him, we can see two things: that the strength of Spinoza's thought by its very existence forced secular considerations upon his opponents; and that, as the eighteenth century wore on and wore out, religion learned once more to take its support from metaphysics. Physics, even Newtonian physics, proved in the end not to provide support for the idea of a personal God. Spinoza may not have won his battle against a personal God, but he certainly succeeded in mak- ing orthodoxy less orthodox. Reading a great number of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century tracts on the same subject, one realizes again the extraordinary vitality of ideas -like the viruses in the body, ideas mutate to fit their environment. The record of all ideas, great or small, is the story of accommodation-and the historian learns, to his sorrow sometimes, that ideas survive not only because they are excellent or "true," but because they are appealing, or am- biguous, or adaptable, or trivial and easy. We can safely assume that Spinoza's ideas were not trivial; and their adaptability may be traced to their ambiguity as well as to their importance and power. Although his readers tried to sweep him under the carpet as soon as his works appeared, those works nonetheless attracted attention from the orthodox. Before his fame reached England, Spinoza had already met "refutation" at the hands of both Calvinist and sectarian divines in Holland.6 As far as one can tell, the first Englishmen to read Spinoza were those theologians deeply involved in the intellectual crisis of the late seventeenth cen- tury, the Platonists of Cambridge, who kept abreast of the problems faced by their like-minded continental colleagues. In 1671, almost immedi- ately upon its publication, Philippus van Lim- borch, Professor of Theology at the Remonstrant (Arminian) Seminary on the Keizersgracht in Amsterdam, sent a copy of the Tractatus Theo- logico-Politicus to Oliver Doiley in Cambridge, warning him against the impieties he would read therein. Shortly thereafter, Limborch exchanged with Henry Jenkes, another Cambridge man, bit- ter denunciations of the Jewish excommunicate.7 Neither Doiley nor Jenkes seems to have written a refutation of Spinoza, but it was not long before the chief spokesmen for their university and their theological position, Henry More and Ralph Cud- worth, obliged-More in two Latin essays spe- cifically attacking the infidelities of Spinoza's writings,8 and Cudworth in his massive treatise, A True Intellectual System of the Universe.9 As we shall see, to them Spinoza seemed so extreme as-almost-to require no refutation. His attacks on the authenticity of Scripture, while serious enough, derived from a method not very different from that of Erasmus and Grotius, both constantly cited by the Dutch Remonstrants, who reckoned Erasmus their spiritual ancestor and Grotius an uncanonized saint in their church. But Spinoza's 6 For discussion of Dutch reactions to Spinoza's work, see Meinsma, K.

Spinoza's remarkably liberated attitude toward the founder of the Christian re- ligion, so shocking to European readers, derived from his peculiar cultural position, since as a Jew he had never had to take seriously Christian claims that Jesus was the Son of God. Alarming as his Christology was to his original readers, it was by no means the most radical of his philosophical formulations. Spinoza's readers may be forgiven their almost automatic coupling of his ideas with those of the genial heterodox, Thomas Hobbes; for in the Preface to the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, Spinoza repeated many of the most shocking Hobbesian propositions. He attributed the preva- lence of superstition, carefully nurtured by the divines, to the church's need to preserve itself as an institution; he likened ecclesiastical manipula- tion of men's minds to the Machiavellian hypoc- risies of ordinary secular leaders. Further, he attacked the frivolous and exhibitionist behavior of priests and holy men, calling their utterances merely the playing of actors; and he criticized the want of charity evident in the manners and cus- toms of believers in a God who above all virtues praised that of charity. It is odd that no readers gave him credit for the conventionality of his morality in judging these cases; unlike Hobbes, who accepted such behavior as a necessary part of the government of fallen men, Spinoza lamented the gap between the theory and practice of Christianity. The unflattering contrast he drew between Christian theory and practice, however, was not the worst thing Spinoza did, as far as his English readers were concerned, though they chose to treat him as a cynical Machiavellian. After all, the reformers' stock in trade is precisely the ethical shortcomings of believers, as they exhort good men to a more consistent translation of faith into works. But Spinoza did not put the familiar dis- crepancy to the conventional hortatory use. His realistic appraisal of men's relative immorality, even well within the Judaeo-Christian tradition, led him to question the bases of that morality and its claims to particular sanctity. Erasmus had turned the humanist tools upon Scripture itself, and Luther and Melancthon had trained their philology upon the Bible: priest imitated rabbi, pastor imitated priest in the study of God's Word, but always constructively, to re- store that Word to its original purity, to free it of alloy. Spinoza's calm consideration of Scripture as an historical rather than an eternal document may have been the logical issue of the marriage between humanism and rationalism; but it was nonetheless a radical breach in the barriers of convention and preconception, a major secular as- sault upon the seat of all orthodoxy. It was as the defenders of liberal, irenic ortho- doxy that the English Platonists rose to Spinoza's challenge. For Henry More, experienced in the long war against mechanism, the Tractatus seemed another link in the dangerous mechanical chain squeezing the life out of the world; a convinced idealist and animist, More drew against Spinoza the old weapons he had forged against Descartes 10 and dipped into the blood of Thomas Hobbes. Though Henry More did not at first regard him as such, Spinoza was in some respects a far more formidable opponent than the other two, since he dealt more squarely than either with Scripture it- self. Against Christian divines, Spinoza had one unquestionable advantage-his thorough training in Hebrew; so that the arguments he marshalled to criticize Scripture were very difficult for his less well-trained enemies to meet. For Spinoza, the reconcilement of revelation with reason (to which Henry More had devoted his whole life and powers) was an irrelevant and fundamentally unphilosophical enterprise: "The sphere of reason is, as we have said, truth and wisdom; the sphere of theology is piety and obedi- ence." 11 From the relative, historistic argument he developed to deal with the intent of Scripture, he concluded that "we may draw the absolute con- clusion, that the Bible must not be accommodated to reason, nor reason to the Bible.12 Such a con- clusion was insupportable to More, who tackled it at the strongest point of Spinoza's defense-on the question of miracles. For More, the existence of miracles not only did not impair the perfection 10 When Henry More first read Spinoza's Tractatus theologico-politicus, he at once connected it with Des- cartes' work, as he wrote to Robert Boyle (Boyle, Works 5: 551, London, 1712). 11 Spinoza, Benedictus de, Chief works, ed.

SOC. of God, but reinforced the idea of His constant providence. God had certainly created a world that operated perfectly through time, but He also had the power to suspend its operations in particu- lar demonstrations of his power and grace.13 Miracles were gratuitous in every sense, in that they were not necessary to God's plan for His well-formed universe, but existed to remind hu- man beings, lulled to inattention by cosmic regu- larity, of His unbounded benevolence. Spinoza's was a genuine and consistent pan- theism-a philosophical position remarkable for its rarity in the western tradition; and Henry More subscribed to the typical Christian solution to the problem of God's relation to His creation, the solution of immanence. Spinoza's forthright identification of God with nature (adumbrated in the Tractatus, though as yet without the logical firmness and elegance of the Ethics) was quite un- acceptable to More or to any Christian Platonist, both because of the equation itself-if God equals Nature, then Nature equals God-and because of the relativity of Nature empirically observed. For Nature is evidently a relative measuring rod, and cannot in herself provide for an eternal and im- mutable morality predicated by the Christian Platonists. Where, in the chaotic sum of morali- ties that "Nature" displayed around the planet, was there room for either right reason or the doctrine of innate ideas? To More, the Tractatus limited God by the postulate of fixed laws or na- ture, and attempted to liberate human behavior from the control of conscience, by the evidence of an empirical ethical relativism.14 When Spinoza's Opera Postuma appeared in 1677, Henry More reconsidered and reinforced his essay against the Tractatus, and wrote an- other, a confutation of the "two columns of athe- ism" demonstrated in the Ethics.'5 The clarity of the Ethics helped him to reduce Spinoza's basic postulates to two (-really, as we recognize, to one): first, the equation of God and infinite mat- ter; second, the assumption of but one universal substance. The first assumption was one More himself had skirted in his own metaphysics,16 so that his confutation of the Ethics attempted the double task of restating his own position and of dissociating that position altogether from Spi- noza's "godlessness." In More's system, im- manence did not imply the identification of God with His creation, His creatures; in all the in- finite variety of possible created things, God was by His spiritual quality distinct from their sub- stance, however His spirit might pervade that substance. God was always protected by His ideal indivisibility from being "in an Ass, as an Ass; in a Louse, as a Louse; in a Toad, as a Toad." 17 For More, though obviously not for Spinoza, the "atheism" of an identification of God with nature, with substance, lay in the threat of divi- sion. Even for the Trinitarian (perhaps especially for the Trinitarian), God is one: a pantheism that permits Him to reside fully and individually in all things suggests, first, that He is not one, but many; and, second, that as Himself, a single, homogeneous God, He is expendable, since He is already totally in all things. That this principle invariably led to libertinage and immorality More made plain: how could anything pervaded by God be said to "die"? And if all things were per- vaded by God, if He was all things, how could any of them be "bad"? Without death, therefore without an after-life, what incentive was there for good behavior on earth? 18 More also attacked Spinoza for "enthusiasm," that irrationality so deplored by well-bred seven- teenth-century divines. The inclusiveness of the Spinozan rhetoric seemed to More like that of the typical Behmenist, Familist, or Quaker, against which he himself, with a notable lack of Christian charity, had earlier taken the field in the defense of a reasonable Christianity. Besides his rhe- torical affinity with those uncontrolled rhapsodists of deity, Spinoza further "proved" his enthusiasm by the very nature of the God he praised so ex- travagantly. Though the idea of a devoted and thorough amor intellectualis dei was intelligible, and even laudable, in More's eyes, the idea of directing such love to nature, and on the "baser part of nature-Natura nwturata," 19 at that, seemed to him the most transparent heresy. More's colleague, Ralph Cudworth, made the 13 More, Epistola altera, 585-588. 14 More, Epistola altera, 590-595. 15 Interestingly enough, More's ideas on the nature of substance and on infinity (at a stage just before the pub- lication, in 1671, of his Enchiridion metaphysicum), were available to Spinoza, who owned J. G. Glazemaker's Dutch translation of Descartes' correspondence, including the exchange with Henry More on these subjects: In- ventaire des livres formant la bibliothetque de Benedit de Spinoza, ed.

Cudworth's True In- tellectual System was to be a handbook (-a giant's manual, it is true) of truths necessary to refute infidelity and atheism, no matter what forms they might take. Unlike More, Cudworth consciously declined the skirmish of contemporary theological polemic; the tone of his great book is consequently far more dignified than most of the defenses of Christianity produced in the seven- teenth century. Only occasionally did Cudworth call his contemporary enemies by name; now and then, he referred directly to Hobbes, and once he identified Spinoza: As for that late Theological Politician who writing against Miracles, denies as well [God's miracles af- fected by natural means] as [God's miracles by super- natural intervention], contending that a Miracle is nothing but a Name, which the Ignorant Vulgar gives, to Opus Na.turae Insolitum, any Unwonted work of Nature, or to what themselves can assign no Cause off [sic]; as also that if there were any such thing done, Contrary to Nature or Above it, it would rather Weaken than Confirm, Our Belief in the Divine Existence; We find his Discourse every way so Weak, Groundless, and Inconsiderable; that we could not think it here to deserve a Confutation.20 All the same, Cudworth followed this with a long discourse in defense of true miracles, both those of the Old Testament and those of the New. But the miracle question, however important, was not for Cudworth the chief stumbling-block in Spinoza's system. Like More, he saw no eter- nal and immutable morality in a system without transcendence: . . . Immoral Theism, or Religion without any Naturall Justice or Morality: (all Just and Unjust, according to this Hypothesis, being mere Theticall or Factitious Things, Made by Arbitrary Will and Command only). . ..21 This was, in his view, "hylozoism," the belief "that makes all Body"; in a detailed analysis of its history from Strato Lampsacus to Spinoza, Cudworth set out to refute the error. Against this particular notion, in its modern forms of Hobbist materialism and Spinozan hylozoism, Cudworth developed his famous (and contro- versial) variation upon the Platonic anima mundi, the principle of plastic nature.22 Others in the More-Cudworth ambiance took their turn at Spinoza. One was Franciscus Mer- curius van Helmont, the Dutch Collegiant turned Quaker, who had come into contact with the Spi- nozan ideas in Holland and who, in England, was a part of the talented circle around the Lady Conway.23 In his Cabbalistic Dialogue, Helmont wrote of the Spinozan identification of God with substance: And yet this Subject so vile and void, which is by us deservedly said to occupy the least part of the Uni- verse, is, notwithstanding in this vulgar Hypothesis, concluded to be co-extended, yea, co-existing, and co-ordinate with God, and therefore is lifted up unto so high an estimation, that all the doctrine in the whole Paga.n Philosophy is exhausted or drawn from this Subject alone: which also is established the measure of all Theorems, Maxims, and Conclusions concerning Spirits, or concerning God; (which they call a Demonstration a posteriori, that is, from ef- fects, or posterior Considerations) whence it becomes an accursed Materialism, and consequently A theism.24 But more important, socially and philosophi- cally, than Helmont's opposition to Spinoza was that of Henry More's "heroine pupil," Anne Con- way. In her Principles of the Most Ancient and Modern Philosophy, published after her death (probably at the instigation of Helmont), Lady Conway discussed "all those Problems or Diffi- culties, which neither by the School nor Common Modern Philosophy, nor by the Cartesian, Hobbes- ian, or Spinosian could be discussed." 25 Because the book was only partially transcribed for its publication,26 the specific analyses of the last 20 Cudworth, Ralph, True intellectual system of the uni- verse, 707, London, 1678. 21 Cudworth, True intellectual system, preface. 22 Cudworth, True intellectual system, 105.

SOC. three systems (unfortunately the most interesting part of her subject) are wanting. Her references to "Cartes," as she called him, are brief, and the other two men receive almost no direct attention. All the same, from the part of the book that is extant, it is clear that she carefully constructed her philosophy as a defense against and from the mechanism she found so influential in her intel- lectual world. Lady Conway, like God, began at the begin- ning; for her, this meant with God and His attri- butes. In an orthodox manner, she divided the essence and the substance of God sharply from the essence and the substance of His creation: "al- though he is not divided, or separated from" His creatures, as their creator He is nonetheless dis- tinct from them. This God (and here she was at one with Spinoza's rhetoric, if not with his intent) is not at all human, or subject to human frailties -"Likewise in God there can exist no Passion, which to speak properly comes from his Creatures: For every Passion is something Temporal, and hath its Beginning, and end with Time." But unlike Spinoza's God, even though He has no passions, Lady Conway's God has will and wis- dom, as well as an "'Idea of himself, which is an Image of himself, or a Word existing within him ... by which Idea or Word, all things were made and created." 27 Lady Conway was a good Pla- tonist, like her tutor: the Idea, or the Logos, produced the created world. Though she clearly separated the substance of the world from the substance of God, she joined the two in time as closely as was possible: creation followed immediately upon God's will and was thus almost co-eternal with Him "even as if two Circles should immediately touch each other." 28 Spinoza had postulated an immutable God and an immutable creation, while Anne Conway postu- lated a continuous creation on God's part, some- thing like Cudworth's plastic nature.29 This con- tinuing creativity left God's will free, as in More's and Cudworth's theology; the world was created, not out of necessity, but simply from God's benevolence, the infinitely conceived pleni- tude of creatures being one mark of His infinite power. Unlike Spinoza's deity, the Lady Con- way's God could always project Himself at will into His creation. Consequently she was able to deal summarily with the three great seventeenth-century rational- ists: "Cartes acknowledged God to be plainly Immaterial, and an incorporeal Spirit. Hobbes ... so confounds God and the Creatures in their Essences . . . [and] Spinosa also confounds God and the Creatures together, and makes but one Being of both. . .." 30 To the claims of Hobbes and Spinoza, that there was no distinction in the creation, that the creatures' forms and essences could change and turn into one another without regard for the hierarchy of being, she answered with her entertaining hypothesis of the virtuous horse, which, although he might become more nearly perfect and even have the opportunity to improve his state through several reincarnations, could never transfer himself from the category of horse to the category of man.3' Just so a man, however virtuous as a man, might never become God, since the attributes of man and the attributes of God were different in kind, the one by definition mutable, the other without change. Another pupil of Henry More and sojourner in Holland, the nonconformist John Howe, also wrote an analysis and refutation of Spinoza's thought. According to his biographer, Edmund Calamy, the self-appointed hagiographer of his nonconformist brethren, Howe was a close friend of Richard Baxter, an ally of Andrew Marvell in his polemical battles,32 an acquaintance of Robert Boyle, at whose instance he wrote his Reconcile- ableness of Reason and Religion in 1677.33 Dur- ing the difficult days under James II, Howe went with Lord Wharton to Utrecht, where he met the "Professors of the Academy" as well as members of the English colony there. Howe may have first met Spinoza's works in Utrecht, for the "Profes- sors of the Academy" fought him hard; though he could have known them already, since both More and Baxter, to say nothing of Boyle,34 had had reason to be concerned with Spinoza's her- esies. At Christ's College, under Cudworth and More, Howe had "receiv'd that Platonick Tinc- ture, which so remarkably runs thro the writings which he drew up and published in his advanced 27 Conway, Principles, 3. 28 Conway, Principles, 9. 29 Conway, Principles, 23. 30 Conway, Principles, 148. 31 Conway, Principles, 59-63. 32 Memoirs of the life of the late revd.

It was written and pub- lished in two parts, the first, "Concerning God's Existence . . . Against Atheism, or the Epicurean Deism"; the second, "Containing Animadversions on Spinosa." The first part appeared in 1675, both parts together in 1702, with the first part somewhat expanded.37 The first part, typical of "that Platonick Tincture," leans heavily on More's Enchiridion Metaphysicum; the second edition quotes largely from The True Intellectual Sys- tern, as well as from Baxter, from the Arminian theologian Curcellaeus, from John Locke, and from Robert Hooke. In dealing with Spinoza, Howe faced up at once to the problem posed, of God's substance. No matter how disguised "to cheat the World with Names, and with a specious Show of Piety." 38 Spinoza's identification of spirit and matter, of God and His creation, was in Howe's eyes funda- mentally blasphemous: "For, as to Religion, it is all one whether we make nothing to be God, or every thing, whether we allow of no God to be worshipped, or leave none to worship him." Such a God as Spinoza postulated is reduced to "the common Receptacle of all imaginable Imperfec- tion and Confusion." 39 Like his predecessors, Howe immediately as- sociated Spinoza with "his Brother Leviathan," an upholder of simple deterministic mechanism, often very foolishly expressed. For example, to Spinoza's fourth definition ("By attribute I mean that which the intellect perceives as constituting the essence of substance"), he rejoined in More's sardonic style: "A Rare Discovery! And which needed Mathematical Demonstration! Well, and what now? Nothing, 'tis true, can be plainer. ." 40 Again, when he noted Spinoza's dis- approval of those who confused human with divine characteristics, he came near to joking-"Who would imagine this to be the complaining Voice of one so industriously labouring to mingle Heaven and Earth! and to make God, and Men, and Beasts, and Stones, and Trees all one and the same individual Substance !" 41 In a list of careful propositions, Howe estab- lished the necessaries of true religion-that some Being necessarily exists and is the cause of all beings not existing of themselves; that this Being is an absolutely perfect, universal, and intelligent cause.42 At the end, he came to an almost mystical rhapsody on the mystery of God's being (which he was careful to support by references to the scien- tific "proofs" of Descartes and Henry More): Self-Existence! Unto now profound an Abyss is a Man cast at the thought of it! How doth it over- whelm, and swallow up his Mind, and whole Soul! With what Satisfaction and Delight, must he see him- self comprehended of what he finds he never can comprehend! 43 Finally, Howe unhesitatingly put forward the con- ventional platonic doctrine of innate ideas (to which his co-religionist Baxter, better read in Locke's works, did not entirely subscribe): though modifications of substance do not neces- sarily need to be conceived, substances themselves are conceived and their existence thus made known. Modifications of them also do exist in so far as they are conceived of.44 Howe struck at Spinoza from that stronghold of Platonic belief where he had learned, from Henry More, to take his tests for truth. Though Howe's treatment of Spinoza betrays nothing of his sectarianism and might have been written by any learned Anglican, Richard Bax- ter's stands out precisely for its outspoken non- conformity. In the last years of the seventeenth century Baxter was the dean of English dissent, who unyieldingly represented and defended his brethren in that difficult period of Anglican re- establishment. During the Protectorate, both the Presbyterians and such sects as the Diggers, Quakers, and Fifth-Monarchy Men had been faced with restrictions upon their rights; and after the Restoration, the promising policy of toleration enunciated by Charles II at Breda proved neither regulated nor particularly tolerant. Not until the limited Toleration Act of 1689 was English dis- sent able to organize itself into the patterns of non- conformist life so characteristic of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a life with its own power- 35Calamy, Memoirs, 126-132, 7-8. 36 Calamy, Memoirs, 34. 37 Howe, John, The living temple, London, 1702. 38 Howe, The living temple, 3. 39 Howe, The living temple, 3. 40 Howe, The living temple, xxiv-xxv. 41Howe, The living temple, xix. 42 Howe, The living temple, 5-6. 43 Howe, The living temple, 9-10. 44 Howe, The living temple, 27-28.</page><page sequence="8">190 ROSALIE L.

His emphasis necessarily fell upon the "things indifferent" of religion; in many cases, his writings are indeed indistinguishable from those of latitudinarian Anglican divines. Baxter's apparent charm and goodness, his social and political concern, his wide-ranging interest and his beautiful prose, all contributed to make him a most effective spokesman for his fellows. His friendly controversies with Robert Boyle and Henry More never altered the fact that his socio- religious position was the same as theirs, that he wanted their society widened to include his. For these reasons, when Baxter was faced with Spi- noza's Tractatus, his reaction was not as noncon- formist to nonconformist, but as nonconformist to outcast. Spinoza's friends from the radical Chris- tian sects of Holland seemed to Baxter, as they did to Henry More, fanatical enthusiasts; Spinoza himself was known to have been cast forth from the congregation of his hereditary faith. For Baxter, Spinoza was repugnant not only for the nature of his ideas, but also for the social position which he chose to occupy; his radicalism was a threat to Baxter's dissent, always trying to demon- strate its constructiveness in conventional society. The Second Part of the Nonconformists Plea for Peace was one of Baxter's many statements of the nonconformist position toward state and crown, a plea for toleration based upon the "things indifferent" in the Protestant religion. Two of the book's sections are devoted to Spinoza, a con- sideration that sent Baxter into broader theoreti- cal formulations that he had made in his earlier works on the same subject, such as his Holy Commonwealth of 1654. The Second Part con- tains a masterly factual account of the contem- porary conditions of English nonconformity, with a history of the efforts for and against inclusion (heavily bolstered by authorities on Baxter's side, many of which were from Anglican sources). One of his rhetorical questions was different from all the others: "Is it the new Philosophers; such Cartesians as Spinoza, and such as Hobbes that you preferf I shall tell you after, what are their politicks."} 46 "Their politicks," whatever they were in fact, seemed to Baxter identical, just as they had seemed to his friend Henry More. Surprisingly, as his principal target Baxter chose, not Jiobbes, as was customary, but Spinoza. H-is first point arose out of dissenting zeal: "I have not yet heard of any such severe persecutions of the Bruitists that are for Hobbes, Spinosa, Pomponatius, Vaninus, &amp;c. as have been used against Loyal Nonconform- ists." His analysis of their principles "so perni- cious, subverting humanity, morality, and Govern- ment," served two purposes, from Baxter's point of view: to expose to the government threats far worse than those it thought it had to fear from loyal nonconformists, and to dissociate virtuous nonconformity from genuine libertine dangers to true religion and holy commonwealth. As Baxter wrote, "I recite other mens Political principles, only that the accusers of my own and such others may compare them together, and see which they judge more rational and loyal." 47 To these "other men" Baxter would have applied the same criterion applied to his co-religionists: they should "be banished five miles from all Cities and Corporations." 48 Baxter struck at once at the moral and ethical statements of Spinoza's Tractatus, assuming that Spinoza like Hobbes believed the natural state of mankind to be one of continual warfare and strug- gle. This is of course a misreading of Spinozan political idealism (as well as a simplification of Hobbes' view); Spinoza was perfectly aware of the brutality to which political organization gave rise, but refused to believe that brutality neces- sarily lay at the base of all human life. He knew well enough, for instance, that men rebelled against their sovereigns, and that when rebels were suc- cessful (as they had recently been in Holland and in England), sovereignty passed into those rebels' hands; but this did not stop him from attempting a blueprint of government in which rebellion would be not just improper, but impossible as well. 45Cragg, Gerald R., Puritanism in the period of the great persecution, 1660-1688, chapters ii, v, and vi, Cambridge, 1957; Schlatter, Richard B., The social ideas of religious leaders, 1660-1688, Oxford, 1940.

As Baxter put it, "God's Law of Nature bindeth mankind (ordinarily) to live in Governed Societies, and hath not left it free to them to do otherwise. Parental Authority is con- junct with our first being, and natural necessity obligeth the rest." 50 Hence to Baxter, the chil- dren Spinoza hypothesized in the Tractatus, who loved their fathers only according to their bond, were in fact in revolt against both parents and sovereign, a revolt that could only lead to a de- nial of God and God's law. Over and over again, Baxter cited Spinoza's advocacy of familial law- lessness-parents and children need not keep faith with one another; parents might destroy their children to save the bother and expense of rais- ing them; children might destroy their parents to get at their inheritance.5' Treason within the family implied treason within the state: indeed, Baxter would have said, trea- son was inevitable in a state composed of Spinozan families: It is the will &amp; mercy of God to Princes and to mankind thus to permit those that will be Atheists and Rebels against him to shew the consequents of it, by their inhumane and rebellious opinions against the Government: That if Princes will ever set up Epicureanism, Atheisme, and Infidelity, they shall set up Rebellion with it, and expose their Lives to every man that hath but a list to venture upon a secret or an open assault. Precepts like these can only be expected from the moral indifferentism Baxter attributed to Spinoza. so that it naturally followed that it was as lawful, yet as much duty to murder any man, or as many as we can, as to save mens lives, to steal and rob as to forbear, to lye and be perjured as to speak truly, to be adulterous as to be chast, to be a Traitor as a Loyal subject; openly dissolving and deriding all divine obligations, save mans, and releasing all mens consciences from them. ...52 Spinoza provided another cause for this sort of behavior, by his denial of the conventional idea of life after death. Over and over again, Spinoza had denounced the divines' practice of inducing good behavior by the threat of damnation for bad: in this, as in much else, Spinoza relied heavily upon the stoic tradition. For Baxter, however, to deny man the prospect of heaven and hell was to reduce him to a mere "Ingenious Beast," that re- called the Cartesian brute-machine. This mech- anist image for man led Baxter to attack the Spi- nozan notion of God, which subjected the Lord God Sabaoth to a rigid necessitarianism upon which even His own laws might never intrude: And the root of this mans inhumanity is his Epicurean principles of Philosophy about God and Nature, supposing God to be but the Eternal neces- sary necessitating first cause of all things and mo- tions, as the Sun is of Light and heat, who can do no more nor less than he doth, moving the world as a Clock or Watch by meer invariable necessity, that never did or can do a miracle, or alter the necessi- tating course of nature. . ..53 Unable to interfere with natural law, the Spi- nozan God also cannot interfere with personal be- havior: if each man has a right to do whatever he desires, and he happens to desire evil, then God must permit that evil, in just the same way that He permits a man to desire and to do good. Thus "he that lyeth, murdereth, stealeth, rebelleth is equally moved to it by God, as he that speaketh truth, and doth all that is just and good." 54 This is the end, as Baxter made plain, of God as a moral force: He is indeed reduced "below humane nature." 55 From Spinoza's universe to total predetermina- tion,56 Baxter selected one particular aspect to 49Cf. articles by Peter Laslett, The world we have lost, in The Listener 63, April 7, April 14, April 21, 1960; Mr. Laslett is at work upon a book expounding his theory of the patriarchal nature of seventeenth-century English society. 50 Baxter, Second part, 15. 51 Baxter, Second part, 2, 10-11. 52 Baxter, Second part, 5. 53 Baxter, Second part, 6. 54 Baxter, Second part, 6. 55 Baxter, Second part, 9. 56 Lest it seem odd that Baxter, the spokesman for Presbyterianism, should object to Spinoza's determinism, it should be explained that, though he was an ordained Presbyterian minister and a recognized leader of his confession, Baxter, like many of his co-religionists in the later seventeenth century, had relaxed the stringent pre- destinarianism of orthodox Calvinist doctrine. In Rich- ard Baxter's catholick theologie: plain, pure, peaceable: for pacification of the dogmaticall world-warriors, Lon- don, 1675, he criticized both Hobbes' and Spinoza's necessitarianism, and what he called "the rest of the Pre- determinants errors . . .": 108, 114.</page><page sequence="10">192 ROSALIE L. COLIE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. attack, the principle of sufficient reason, which, interestingly, he saw as a kind of enthusiasm: And is it not a wonder that a man should think all this to be the undoubted Light of Nature and the produce of free enquiries, and of the true Universal Idea of God, when as Nature taught the contrary to almost all the old Philosophers . . . : yea, to all the most Barbarous Nations of the World, even to our American Savages at this day . . .7? Like More and Glanvill, Baxter feared extremes of religious enthusiasm, particularly that of the Quakers, whose doctrine of inner light seemed to him as dangerous as Spinoza's notion of sufficient reason. He had earlier broken a lance with them and had come away, like Henry More, highly dis- trustful of their reliance upon a natural light that seemed to render Scripture illegible, to say noth- ing of law, church, and reason itself. "They that confound these things by the name of a Light or Law within us, and then talk of the sufficiency of it, do but deceive men when they are deceived." 58 God grants revelation: the "Metaphor of a Light writhin us," simply confounds the case. For Bax- ter, refutation of Spinoza, as well as of the Quak- ers, depended upon revelation: his God was funda- mentally mysterious, the notions men had of Him were all borrowed, analogous, imperfect. None- theless, Baxter was orthodox in assuming that the instrument of God we have within us can lead us to Him; our souls are, with God's grace, "suffi- cient." Though human understanding has no actual knowledge born in it, and therefore has no natural light, man has an intellective disposition to know God, sometimes by degrees, sometimes even immediately.59 Baxter made a significant variation upon the neo-platonic doctrines of innateness; though, ex- cept for this point, his theological objections to the "atheism" of Spinoza were much the same as those of the Platonists. Another Platonist-of the Oxford, not the Cambridge, variety-who dealt directly with Spinoza's philosophy was Richard Burthogge, a generation younger than More and Cudworth, a student at Lincoln College and Lei- den, ultimately a practicing physician. In his Lockean Essay on Reason, he defended orthodoxy against the Spinozan postulates, by the authority of revelation and the promise of an after-life.60 Although Burthogge followed Locke in denying the doctrine of innate ideas,61 he agreed with the Platonists about the dangers to true religion pre- sented by unreasonableness, lack of discipline, and enthusiasm (or "the conceit of inspiration"). Burthogge has the distinction of being the only English philosophical critic in the seventeenth cen- tury to deal with Spinoza's ideas of mind. In answer to Spinoza's proposition that "the first elements, which constitutes the actual being of the human mind, is the idea of some particular thing actually existing" (Ethics, II, Proposition XI); and that "this idea of God is united to the mind in the same way as the mind is united to the body" (Prop. XXI), Burthogge simplified radically: The Idea I have given of Mind, that it is the Im- mediate subject, or (as others perhaps would chuse to say) the Immediate Principle, of Cogitation, En- ergy, or Activity, is much more easie to be conceived than that of Spinosa, when he defines the human mind to be the Idea of a body, or thing, actually existing: for Mind, even the human, is not so properly said to be an Idea, as to be the Principle, our Cause efficient, of Ideas; since all Ideas (even in common sense) are conceived; and Mind is that, which conceives them. Though Burthogge regarded mind as dominant over matter, he did not always accept its primacy over matter; rather, he conceived of ideas in Locke's practical way, subject to the tests of probability: ... I do not find that Spinosa, or Mal. Branche [sic] after all their Ambitious Researches in that higher way have edified the World thereby to any great Degree. This way of seeing all things in God, and in their own proper Realities, is a way much out of the way. Otherwise, when they keep the lower way of sense, many of their thoughts are surprising, and excellent.62 But the metaphysical dilemma of Spinoza's solution to the mind-matter problem could not please Burthogge, since in Spinoza's solution, either way God was robbed of his benevolent will. Either God was "all Substance, and Particular Beings (even formally taken) are but Participa- tions of his; as being only so many several Modi- fications of the Divine Attributes" 63 -equated with the universe and thus absolutely material; or He was "only a Notion, a Name, a Mode of Ex- pression, by which they mean all Causes taken together; and so no more the Name of a Real In- 57Baxter, Second part, 6. 58 Baxter, Second part, 12. 59 Baxter, Second part, 8, 14. 60 See Burthogge, Richard, Causa dei, or an apology for God, London, 1675; and his An essay upon reason, and the nature of spirits, London, 1694. 61 Yolton, John, John Locke and the way of ideas, 20- 22, 46-48, Oxford, 1956. 62 Burthogge, An essay upon reason, 109. 63 Burthogge, An essay upon reason, 116.</page><page sequence="11">VOL. 107, NO. 3, 1963] SPINOZA IN ENGLAND, 1665-1730 193 dividual singular Being, than that of Nature, or Fortune." 64 The implications of either doctrine involve a theory of infinity: on this point, too, Burthogge belonged with the more modern critics of Spinoza rather than with the Platonists. He perceived that More's notion of infinity was as dangerous to God as was Spinoza's. Any idea of infinity as an attribute of God seemed to him mis- taken, since it seemed to shock [God's] distinction and singularity of Being. For thence it is Argued, how can God, be Infinite Being, if he be not all Beings ? And it [sic] he be, how can he be One by himself? be a Singular Indi- vidual Being, distinct from all others? These were the speculations, that obliged Spinosa to conceive of God, that he is the Ingredient, Immanent Cause of all Things. 65 Henry More's doctrine of infinity was no more a guarantee of godhead than Spinoza's, for the danger lay as plain to see: God is an Infinite inane or vacuum, that is, in plain English, an Infinite Nothing indued with Wisdom, Goodness and Power, as, that he is infinite Extension so indued.A For all his Platonism, Burthogge was too deeply persuaded by the Lockean philosophy of ideas to accept as valid all Platonic arguments. For him, the pattern of confutation had to be changed. In- stead of seeming the exact philosophical opposite of the Platonists, Spinoza in some of his argu- ments appeared to Burthogge frighteningly close to them-to the detriment of their authority. Other ways than those of the Platonists had to be devised to fight off the "atheist," some dependent upon the seminal and generalized notions of phi- losophy made current by the Platonists, some quite different from their broad analogical method of finding the significance of things. The English Platonists raised English theology above the sec- tarian struggle in which it had too long been en- gaged, restored English theology to philosophy, recognized that the chief dangers to religion sprang less from within the jealous Christian family than from independent outsiders. To their credit, the Platonists knew the importance (though not the greatness) of Spinoza; from the security of their broad and irenic understanding of their intellectual world, they dared to take him on. For this they are greatly to be honored: but, like many great thinkers, neither Cudworth nor More, certainly not Lady Conway, charmer though she was, still less Howe and Baxter, saw the dangers inherent in a belief, of which they them- selves were the architects and masons, increasingly generalized, increasingly inclusive, increasingly "indifferent." Their partisan Burthogge sus- pected some of the weak places in their temple, and deism was very nearly to blow the house down. With the developing strength of deism, and with the defenses drawn up against it, the figure of Spinoza was slowly to change, from the godless mechanist Hobbist-the Spinoza of More, Cudworth, Howe, and Baxter-into something quite different and far less alien. II. SPINOZA AND ROBERT BOYLE The connection between Benedict de Spinoza and Robert Boyle is of uncommon importance, be- cause it classically illustrates how two very talented men, working with a common stock of philosophi- cal materials, contributed to diametrically opposed developments of "natural religion." Both men were profoundly concerned with the reconsider- ations in philosophy necessitated by the newly or- ganized concepts of the material and ideal worlds in which they lived. Boyle's principle contribu- tion to thought lay in the justification, even the glorification, of life in the laboratory; and in the model he provided, in his person, his actions, and his writings, for dealing religiously with the prob- lems raised by the "nature" of the seventeenth- century scientists and philosophers.' Boyle was preeminently the empiricist, the "sceptical chymist," who, though he might ques- tion all the bases of his art, nonetheless preserved an extraordinarily clear faith in the Creator's mighty design. For these reasons, he did more than any English scientist before Newton to dig- nify the study of God's works. From the vantage- point (if it is one) of the present, we might well wonder how Boyle could be at once so secure in his belief in God's material providence and so willing to test all hypotheses about that material in the laboratory: but as we shall see in the specific 64 Burthogge, An essay upon reason, 117. 65 Burthogge, An essay upon reason, 118. 66 Burthogge, An essay upon reason, 120. 1 The term "natural religion" is historically applicable to the systems both of Boyle and Spinoza; it was not until deist thought had been defined and identified that "natural religion" became a term denoting opposition to established religion. For Boyle's empiricism, see Boas, Marie, Robert Boyle and seventeenth-century chemistry, Cambridge, 1958; and Krook, Dorothea, Two Baconians: Robert Boyle and Joseph Glanvill, Huntington Library Quart. 18: 261-278, 1954-55.</page><page sequence="12">194 ROSALIE L. COLIE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. cases examined here, his faith was so strong that he could doubt without losing his balance. Boyle was so sure of ultimate universal rationality that he could freely examine the apparent quirks which material creation continually offered to his inspec- tion. Spinoza was also to some extent a practical man of science. The well-born Christian Huygens, whose apparatus was always the best, ordered lenses ground by his curious neighbor; and Spi- noza's letters show that he knew the condition of the natural sciences of his time.2 But he was never an empiricist in the Baconian way: Spinoza was always Cartesian, if not a Cartesian, in his rationalism, an abstracter, a formulator, a mathe- matician. For him, the material world was cer- tainly real enough, but abstractly rather than spe- cifically real-specific and separate material things interested him far less than the idea of substance. All Boyle's works on nature make plain how deeply he was involved in nature's spe- cific operations. Though natura naturata, or physics, was indispensable in Spinoza's view of reality, his own extensive practical experience of nature is not metaphysically obvious in either the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus or the Ethics.3 Spinoza's connection with Boyle began in 1661, when Henry Oldenburg, the secretary to the Royal Society who was particularly devoted to the interests of his patron, Robert Boyle, opened a correspondence with the young thinker who had so impressed him during his visit to Holland. Probably because of Boyle's extreme business and physical frailty (and not, as Professor Wolf im- plies, because of his latent anti-Semitism),4 Spi- noza and Boyle seem never to have exchanged letters directly; but Oldenburg kept them in- formed of each other's progress and relayed their comments on each other's work. In the series of letters that passed between Spinoza and Olden- burg, then, we have to deal not simply with Boyle's reaction to Spinoza or Spinoza's view of Boyle's work, but to some extent also with the personality of Henry Oldenburg, who for all his subservience to Boyle was no mere amanuensis, and often expressed his own opinions and inten- tions with frankness and firmness. For some time the tone of the letters was uni- formly polite: Spinoza dutifully answered Olden- burg's questions about Boyle's experiments and, as the order of his points shows, kept Oldenburg abreast of the work which later became the early propositions of the Ethics. One is struck by the sophistication, philosophical and social, of the correspondence. For example, Henry Oldenburg wrote to Spinoza about the Hollander's idea of God, . . .do you understand clearly and without doubt that from the mere definition which you give of God, it can be demonstrated that such a Being exists? I, indeed, when I consider that definitions contain noth- ing but conceptions of our Mind, moreover that our Mind conceives many things which do not exist, and is very fruitful in the multiplication and augmentation of things once conceived, I do not see yet how from the conception that I have of God I can infer the existence of God.5 This question can only be either very naive or very radical. Oldenburg's observation, though, is probably radical rather than naive, since it would have been far easier for him simply to accept the validity of the doctrine of innateness than to ques- tion, as he does here, orthodox epistemology. On the other hand, his experience as a middleman for experimenters may have taught him to distrust any epistemology which lent validation to any and every intellectual formulation-which is, at its re- duction, what the doctrine of innate ideas does. In the early days of the correspondence, the 2 Some of Spinoza's letters to Oldenburg are entirely devoted to specific experiments (Spinoza, The corre- spondence, ed. and tr. A[braham] Wolf, 84-99, 122-131; London, 1928; Opera 2: 204-217, 234-240. In other letters, Spinoza showed his familiarity with the state of natural science in his time (Correspondence, 189-190; Opera 2: 234-240). For commentary on Spinoza's in- terest in the natural sciences, see Crommelin, C. A., Spi- nozas natuurwetenschappelijk denken, Mededeelingen van wege het Spinozahuis 6: 1939; Coert, H.

Spinoza, Correspondence, introduction, 35-36. In his attribution to Boyle of snobbery in not writing di- rectly to Spinoza (pp. 37-38), Wolf had apparently for- gotten Boyle's habit of using amanuenses for his profes- sional and some of his private correspondence, even before his paralysis of 1670.

Oldenburg, evidently seconded by Boyle, urged Spinoza to persevere in his philosophical speculation, no matter how trying the conditions under which he had to work. It was to Oldenburg that Spinoza first expressed in 1662 his fears of the divines' ultimate reception of his work; 6 in 1665, quite without censure, Oldenburg trans- mitted to Boyle Spinoza's reasons for holding back from publication his "Treatise about [his] in- terpretation of Scripture"-he was afraid of criti- cism both from the divines, against whom he had specifically written, and of the common people, who were, he felt, all too quick to call a man an atheist for his opinions.7 When the book on "Angels, prophecy and mira- cles" finally appeared in 1670 as Tractatus Theo- logico-Politicus, however, relations between Spi- noza and his correspondents of the Royal Society promptly deteriorated. At first Oldenburg, shocked at the sentiments that he read there, could not believe that Spinoza meant what he seemed to say 8 and turned his encouragement in the direction of a clearer style of presentation. " . [s]o far from intending any harm to true Religion and sound Philosophy," Spinoza was, he was sure, "actually laboring" to commend and es- tablish the true object of the Christian religion, and the divine sublimity and excellence of a fruitful philosophy. As a precaution against fur- ther misunderstanding by himself as well as by the threatening phalanx of divines, he suggested that Spinoza consult him before publishing fur- ther, that his own care "might remove the preju- dices which have been conceived against your thought." 9 But Oldenburg could not for long maintain even this limited approval of Spinoza's views: inevita- bly, there were too many heterodox utterances in the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus to be explained away. With the best will in the world, Spinoza's explanations of his "fatalism," 10 his Christology," his attitude toward free will,12 his rejection of miracles,13 could not persuade Oldenburg that Spinoza was genuinely religious. All the things that More, Baxter, and the rest had said or were to say about the radical postulates in the Trac- tatus, Henry Oldenburg informally mooted in the correspondence. He registered his objections to various Spinozan positions-to the denial of free will to God, to Spinoza's refusal to accept without qualification the truth of the resurrection of Christ, to the equation of God with nature-or, as it cor- rectly seemed to Oldenburg, with the material world itself. Henry Oldenburg was not the man to write a real refutation of Spinoza, nor did he attempt formal examination of the Spinozan-and the sup- posed Spinozan-assertions. In the work of Robert Boyle, however, is an essay directed spe- cifically to the problems Spinoza raised. Boyle's religious position 14 was not conspicuously in- teresting: he was not original in his theology, and the lines of his arguments (sometimes even his phraseology) often parallel those of the Anglican divines whose primary business it was to defend the true religion against her enemies. In the argu- ments against the "naturists," Boyle had an ad- vantage over the divines, even over Henry More, who relied exceptionally heavily upon scientific analogy and explanation to bolster his metaphys- ics and his theology. Boyle's favorite argument sprang from his own unique position in English life-as nobleman, religious layman, creative natu- ral scientist and patron of natural science, he felt himself chosen, and was so regarded by his countrymen, to defend the orthodoxy of his trade, to integrate the systematic study of nature with devout and respectful study of God's word. Language changes, accommodating to new modes of thought. Bacon had been able to play upon the rhetorically symmetrical idea of the book of God's Word and the Book of God's Works, the notions of being and becoming, to accustom men' s minds to the idea that external nature could be regarded as a book in which messages of God's providence lay open to the reader, and to urge men to learn the language of that book. His language of things, however, had not triumphed in seventeenth-century ways of thought: Bacon's laboratory language yielded to the Galilean con- quest of mathematics as the mode in which natural philosophy was to be understood. And mathe- matical abstraction, as even Spinoza found, is a difficult medium in which to express the qualities of faith. 6 Spinoza, Correspondence, 206; Opera 2: 305. 7 Spinoza, Correspondence, 206-207; Opera 2: 305. 8 Boyle, Works 6: 302. 9 Boyle, Works 6: 302.

Though Boyle's view of science and religion was by no means entirely conventional, nonethe- less it operated well within the old frame of un- derstanding. His insistence upon the possibility and feasibility of a devout natural scientist, a man at once truly a "Christian virtuoso" and a "scepti- cal chymist," was directed against the popular no- tion that a natural philosopher was by definition a materialist and a denigrator of the mysteries in- volved in faith. As he wrote in The Excellency of Theology,15 his own excellency in natural phi- losophy made his colleagues pay attention to his words on religion, where their attention might have wavered from the exhortations of nonscien- tific divines. Over and over again Boyle claimed his particular title to speak out for orthodoxy: as a natural scientist, he could persuade his col- leagues; as a deeply religious student of theology, his words as a scientist carried weight among believers. His fitness in these respects presented him with a serious intellectual problem. He could and did, as we shall see, use a method of proof far more empirical than that of the Christian Platonists More, Cudworth, and Glanvill; and he had to check his natural empiricism sharply to keep clear of the dangers of materialism and sensationalism he himself deplored. Absolutely unlike Spinoza, but like the Platonists, Boyle drew a sharp line between those things of God proper to be known and the ultimately unknowable essence of the deity. As Eugenius says in A Discourse of Things above Reason, For the free Decrees of God, and his determinations concerning the Government of the World, and the future state of mankind (to name now no others) are things which no humane Reason can pry into, but must owe the fundamental discovery it makes of them, to the Revelation of him, whose purposes they are."' Boyle had not, though, the advantages of the Platonist position for his argument: in religion he continually shied away from abstraction by anal- ogy, correspondence, and symbol, and turned the literalism necessary in his laboratory into a de- fense of religion. It is said that once he objected to an allegorical sermon on Daniel, because he felt "himself obliged for the honour of God's truth to say that this place in Daniel being the clearest one in all the Old Testament for the proof of the resurrection, we ought not to suffer the meaning of it to evaporate into allegory...." 17 In the matter of Biblical criticism, too, he took the literalist, even historicist, way to explain some of the con- fusions of the language of the Old Testament, noting for example that the modern reader often found difficulties in scriptural text because some utterances were directed at one and the same time both to contemporaries of the speaker and to the people of God in all times.'8 For him, unneces- sary allegory led to a relativistic and ultimately un- truthful view of Scripture; in addition, he dis- trusted undue abstraction, in which direction also symbolic allegory too easily led. Nor was allegori- cal abstraction the only danger in Biblical inter- pretation Boyle recognized: he condemned those divines "who little considering what God is, and what themselves are, presume to talk of Him and his Attributes as freely and as unpremeditately, as if they were talking of a Geometrical or a Mechanical engine" 19-and, if he distrusted di- vines, how much more did he dislike philosophers addicted to such geometrizing! There were ap- propriate ways assigned man to know God: by "the Contemplation of his Works, and the study of his Word"-but as Boyle himself put it, "I think it may be doubted whether either or both of these, will suffice to acquaint us with his Perfec- tions." 20 All we can know is "That he is, and in a great measure What he is not; but to understand thoroughly What he is, is a task too great for any but his own infinite intellect. ..." 21 For man whom God had given "an innate desire of know- ing" 22 to consider his reason as infinite as his author's was to degrade that author and his handiwork.23 Spinoza's Ethics, of course, expressed exactly opposite views of knowledge. In the first place, Spinoza's reasoning more geometrico was, in his own view, the proper instrument to reach absolute knowledge: his extraordinary chains of reasoning were the exercise, not of empirical procedure, but of a rigorous if illuminated logic. For Spinoza, ideas had to be true; one test of their truth was 15 Boyle, Robert, The excellency of theology, compar'd with natural philosophy, London, 1674, preface. 16 Boyle, Robert, A discourse of things above reason, 3, London, 1674. 17 Birch, Thomas, Life of Mr. Boyle, Works of Robert Boyle in six volumes 1: cxi, London, 1772. 18 Boyle, Robert, Some considerations touching the style of the holy scriptures, 21-23, London, 1663. 19 Boyle, Robert, Of the high veneration man's intellect owes to God, 1, London, 1685. 20 Boyle, High veneration, 2-3. 21 Boyle, Things above reason, 8. 22 Boyle, High veneration, 86. 23 Boyle, Things above reason, 22-23.</page><page sequence="15">VOL. 107, NO. 3, 1963] SPINOZA IN ENGLAND, 1665-1730 197 their logical inevitability. Language had to be true, too, therefore: if ideas could not be put into clear and distinct grammar, they were not clear and distinct, and therefore not true. The conti- nental rationalists were untroubled by efforts at empirical verification, which seemed to them too often to be wastes of time better spent in thinking. Spinoza trusted himself and his instrument, the inexorable logic by which he attempted to leave nothing unexplained or inexplicable. For Boyle and Oldenburg, this was philosophical hubris more excessive even than that of the Stoics. Boyle took his philosophico-religious stand at a point whence he could cover the onslaughts both of Hobbes and of Spinoza, where he could mar- shall all his proper forces: at the concept of nature. In A Free Enquiry Into the Vulgarly Receiv'd Notion of Nature 24 he studied the semantics as well as the actualities involved in the idea of na- ture, both as it was generally conceived and as it should, from his point of view, properly be conceived. And, because many Atheists ascribe so much to Nature, that they think it needless to have Recourse to a Deity, for the giving an Account of the Phae- nomena of the Universe: And, on the other side, very many Theists seem to think the commonly Re- ceived Notions of Nature, little less, than Necessary to the Proof of the Existence and Providence of God; I, who differ from both these Parties, and yet think every true Theist, and much more every true Chris- tian, ought to be much concerned for Truths, that have so powerful an Influence on Religion, thought my self, for its sake, oblig'd to consider this Matter, both with the more Attention and with regard to Religion.25 Boyle was careful: he tabulated the many ideas of nature that were or had been current and picked his way carefully among them. He re- jected, as most like-minded men of the century did, Aristotle's doctrine of the eternity of the world, whose creation was ultimately ascribable to Aristotelian nature; he also warned against considering nature to be a "semi-deity" or the lieutenant of God, a medieval commonplace re- cently animated by More and Cudworth in their struggle against Cartesian dualism and Hobbesian mechanism. Spinoza's concept of creative nature offered Boyle no satisfaction; for natura naturans Boyle simply substituted "God," Wholly discarding an Expression which, besides that 'tis harsh and needless, and in use only among the School-men, seems not to me very suitable to the profound Reverence we owe the Divine Majesty; since it seems to make the Creator differ too little by far from a Created (not to say an Imaginary) Being.26 Sometimes Boyle agreed with the first state- ment of a Spinozan position, such as in his criti- cism of the human selfishness and short-sighted- ness revealed in the common view that God had ordered the entire universe for the convenience of some few particular human beings: The second Limitation ... is this, That the Omni- present Author of Things, who, in His Vast and Boundless Understanding, comprehended, at once, the whole System of His Works, and every Part of it, did not mainly intend the Welfare of such or such particular Creatures, but subordinated His Care of maintaining the Universal System and Primitive Scheme or Contrivance of His Works, and especially those Catholick Rules of Motion, and other Grand Laws, which He at first establish'd among the Por- tions of the Mundane Matter.27 The "Catholick Rules of Motion, and other Grand Laws," were regula drawn up by God for His own purposes, not for man's-with this state- ment Spinoza would certainly have been in agree- ment. But he could not have acceded to the impli- cations Boyle drew from it, that God's rules were not absolute (even when they were "perfect"). For Boyle, as for the Platonists, God must not suf- fer restriction, even by His own rules. His "Catholick Rules of Motion" by no means pre- cluded the possibility of "seeming irregularities, such as Earthquakes, Floods, Famins, &amp;c.... " 28 Boyle states here the argument for theistic regula- tion, by which God is free at all times to abrogate any of His rules; Spinoza, as Leslie Stephen pointed out,29 formulated the theory of regulation that was to become the deist position, by which God's rules were understood as perfect and there- fore as absolutely unchangeable. According to that view, the world is a part of a universal order of cause and effect, in which all events are necessary consequences of what went before. Man's will is unavailing against such laws of nature, and God is as powerless as man to alter them. There is more than a hint of strict Calvinism in this, but in Calvinism the stress fell upon the entire helplessness of human beings; Calvin's God was never the prisoner of 24 London, 1685-86. 25 Boyle, A free enquiry, preface. 26 Boyle, A free enquiry, 35. 27 Boyle, A free enquiry, 167, 400. 28 Boyle, A free enquiry, 167-168. 29 Stephen, Leslie, History of English thought in the eighteenth century 1: 33, London, 1876.</page><page sequence="16">198 ROSALIE L. COLIE IPROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. His prior will. Boyle seems to have recognized the threat to a benevolent God implicit in the deistic theory of regulation-just as Henry More had feared Descartes's banishment of God from his universe, so Boyle reacted to the greater dan- gers of the Spinozan formulation. He responded by bearing down hard on the existence of miracles-"if we set aside the Con- sideration of Miracles," he wrote, then all God's laws are rational and regular. "Setting miracles aside" did not mean ignoring them: quite the con- trary, for miracles in Boyle's view were the tokens of God's freedom from the general restrictions by which He conducted His world. As the divines usually did, Boyle did not accept miracles on the spiritual authority of Scripture alone. His doc- trine of miracles, of a piece with his other argu- mentation, had empirical authority as well. Miracles had been known to happen; they had an historical existence which could not be undone. The testimony of true observers was incontro- vertible, and no merely mundane exception might be made of them. But Boyle by no means accepted the purely mechanistic and naturalistic explanation of divine "miracle" that Hobbes offered; and Spinoza's denial of the very existence of miracles was, to him, the pointless denial of events "proved" to have occurred.30 At its simplest, Boyle's explana- tion of miracles resembles Spinoza's, just as his simplest statement of God's laws resembles Spi- noza's-but Boyle's explanation smacks of the experimeiitalist, readier to live with the unknown, than of the lens-grinder performing according to specifications already drawn up. Boyle was will- ing to consider the proposition that miracles fol- lowed a logic still incomprehensible to human beings, operated by laws analogous to the laws of nature still unknown to humans but certainly known to God. Analogous to the laws of nature -not the laws of nature themselves: Boyle still felt the need to safeguard the deity's freedom in this particular manifestation of His grace. He admitted God's immanence in His creation, for the idea of immanence permitted God freedom of motion and of will, and maintained the separa- tion of spirit and matter. Under Boyle's imma- nent God, the world (and whatever was under- stood as "nature") was infinitely in God's specific power as well as under those "Catholick Laws" of nature. To study the constitution of nature's laws was the obligation of the natural philosopher, but the will of God was supreme, a mysterious power to which, as the natural philosopher would prob- ably be able to observe himself, even laws of nature had to bend.31 Boyle admired and loved nature and the laws of nature, but he never confused nature with God. His God was a deity transcendent in both His ex- istence and His power; and nature was, inevita- bly, data, materia. Pantheism bound the two into one, but an immanent God was free to withdraw Himself at will from materiality. The physico- chemical doctrine of corpuscularianism was in some hands (Gassendi's, for instance) a dangerous revival of the old Democritan atomism, a system which provided for no deity, and no concept of deity. Like Henry More, Sir Thomas Browne, and Robert Burton, to name only a few, Robert Boyle was a theistic, a platonizing atomist: for them, corpuscular elements did not form specific material things by accident, as they had in Greek atomist thought, but fell into place according to the ideas in the mind of the infinite God: "since He cannot but know the extent of His own infinite Power, He cannot but know numberless things as possible [sic], that He has not yet made nor perhaps ever will please to make." 32 God may know in advance what His miracles may be, just as He knows all other things, but that fact does not make miracles a prescribed part of the universe's operation. Boyle thought that Spinoza limited God's power by regarding His laws as necessary. For Spinoza, however, the exact opposite seemed to be the case: the necessity of God's laws was the very proof of His perfection. That is to say, for all his love and admiration for natural processes, Boyle be- longed in the Christian tradition of dualism and Spinoza did not. Boyle could not conceive of natura naturata left to natural laws alone, because by that he felt nature to be reduced to mere data, to be made neutral and without morality. For him, both Hobbes's mechanism and Spinoza's pantheism were the same form of atheism, ex- pressed in slightly different language-Hobbes re- moved nature from subordination to God's provi- dence and therefore denied to God a will of His own; Spinoza so identified God with nature as to deny Him equally any moral will. Indeed, Boyle conceived of God in the very 30 Spinoza, Tractatus, chapter vi. Cf.

For Boyle, human nature justified explanation of the divine nature; for human free will, so jealously defended by liberal churchmen against extreme Calvinists, was conceivable only as an image of divine free will. In Boyle's view, miracles were the proof of divine freedom to inter- cede, at any level at all, in the workings of created nature. Miracles, attested by doctrine, existed to make proud or inattentive men remember who the master is, or to award to some particular persons signs of God's special grace, or to forestall calami- ties otherwise prescribed by those inexorable "Catholick Laws" of nature. The Tractatus Theologico-Politicus so offended Boyle that he set himself to compose an answer to it: the manuscript treatise "On Miracles" among the Boyle Papers in the Royal Society bears the heading, in the familiar hand of one of his amanuenses, "Mr. Boyle's Answer to Spi- nosa." 33 This means that Boyle recognized the persuasiveness of the Tractatus, and tackled it as an empiricist, at the point he considered it most vulnerable. Of all "the several Proofs, that may be rationally offer'd for the Christian Religion," there was none he thought "fitter than that drawne from Miracles." For him, indeed, a belief in miracles was essential to salvation: to have a right Judgment of Miracles &amp; their con- sequences is of very great moment, if not necessity, to direct us securely in makeing our Choyce of Re- ligion, which is the importantest action of our Under- standing, &amp; on which very much depends, besides the solid Happiness of the Soul in this Life, the endless felicity of the whole man in the Life to come.34 Boyle considered miracles to be the result of God's unquestionable fiat, but also saw in them a "vindication of the way of Probation it selfe." 35 Not only were they the ratification of the doctrine their occurrence underscored, but they also sanc- tioned particular doctrines and methods, gave direction to man's worship beyond his innate assurances of God: For tho tis not to be denyed, that there is a natural Religion, whose Principles being congenite with us, or easily deducible from the Contemplation of the Universe &amp; ourselves, has no need of Miracles to recommend it; yet since an Instituted Religion as such, pretends to be founded upon supernatural Reve- lation, &amp; comprises not only a discovery of Truths relateing to the Object of Worship, but Rites of Wor- ship, if not also Rules of Life; tis plaine that there might be some supernatural way to ascertain men... that this way of knowing God is really instituted by him.36 A world without miracles left no room for test- ing God, or rather, for human realization that God had made Himself manifest. Spinoza's pantheism was no answer either, since it separated God from natural law and subjugated the deity to laws which He may have instituted but over which He had no subsequent control.37 For Boyle, God was not God if His will was not free: "God is a most free Agent; and his Divine Wisdom does accompany all that he does, in such a manner, as not to impair his Freedom." 38 But even granting God's infinite freedom and power, Boyle considered that human understand- ing of natural law might well be too rigid, that "those supernatural Phaenomena," may not be "so Repugnant to the Laws of Nature, or perhaps not Receding so far from them, as men are wont to conceive." 3 For the chemist (or for the physi- cian, as Locke discovered for himself and demon- strated to his readers) laws of nature do not seem so rigidly determined as they do for the physicist. Boyle was able to work under the hazard of more indeterminates than, say, Galileo or Descartes. Perhaps because he was an empirical philosopher and empirically, if not religiously, sceptical, he shied away from the logical and mathematical definitions of rationalists. Boyle did not have to choose between the supernatural and the ra- tional, or between the supernatural and the na- tural: he was willing to take both on faith. For this reason, his curious argument for the resurrection of Christ,40 in which he attempted to provide parallels from experimental science to that miraculous process, is not so irrational as it may sound. Belief in the resurrection is funda- mental to any claim to Christianity-Oldenburg had realized this when he begged Spinoza to ac- cept as literally true the account of Christ's resur- rection, since "the circumstances recorded by the Evangelists seem to urge profoundly that it be taken literally." 41 Oldenburg, like Boyle, was 33Royal Society, Boyle Papers III, f. 112; printed here in appendix II. 34 Boyle Papers III, ff. 105-106; appendix I. 35Boyle Papers III, f. 106; appendix I. 36 Boyle Papers II, f. 109; appendix I. 37 Boyle Papers III, f. 113; appendix II. 38 Boyle Papers III, f. 113, appendix II. 39 Boyle Papers III, f. 114; appendix II. 40 Boyle, Robert, Some Physico-theological consider- ations about the possibility of the resurrection, London, 1675. 41 Spinoza, Correspondence, 357; Opera 2: 422.</page><page sequence="18">200 ROSALIE L. COLIE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. not relying upon the supernatural authority of Scripture as the Word of God, he was accepting the testimony of eyewitnesses to the event. When Spinoza replied that he accepted the passion, death, and burial of Christ-the historical se- quence-literally, but the resurrection allegori- cally, he was denying the basis of the Christian religion. Oldenburg minced no words in telling him so: The whole Christian Religion, and its truth, rests on this article of the Resurrection, and if it is taken away, the mission of Christ and his heavenly Teach- ing collapse. It cannot be unknown to you how much Christ, when he had been raised from the dead, endeavoured to convince his disciples of the truth of the Resurrection, properly so called. To want to turn all these things into allegories is the same as if some one tried hard to overthrow the whole truth of the Gospel History.42 There was further historical testimony to the resurrection: scripture provided, in the story of the doubting Thomas especially dear to empirical scientists, an experiment with proof that Boyle and Oldenburg-but evidently not Spinoza-could accept without qualification. Boyle's corpuscu- larianism was, as we have seen, a physics in which each particle of matter could harbor the immanent God. For him, "Corpuscularian Principles may not only be admitted without Epicurean Errors, but he imploy'd against them." 43 Indeed, Boyle's corpuscularianism, though composed of "atomic" units, was not the same thing as ancient atomism, or the atomism of Gassendi. His corpuscles were, literally and really, "little bodies," incorporated into larger wholes. And corporate things remain the "same" even when sensibly changed-Rome is Rome though sacked and in ruins; a university remains a university though colleges change and decay. Like John Locke, Boyle was concerned with the problem of identity of bodies: the human body, for instance, is always in flux, even when unimpaired by outside forces.44 In the eyes of God, the body of a man is still that man's body, to be raised at the resurrection, even though eaten and digested by cannibals, literally assumed into the body of those cannibals.45 More than this, there are empirical tests recorded in Scripture to satisfy the doubting Thomases of subsequent gen- erations: Ezekiel's vision of the dry bones and the raising of Lazarus testify to God's chemistry in the resurrection of bodies." Boyle does not, alas, give us exact laboratory equivalents to the resurrection-we are not neces- sarily seduced into belief in that mystery by the fact that certain vegetables maintain their color, smell, and taste when they are consumed by animals or transmuted into gin; or by the fact that dark opacous lead can be turned into finely colored or transparent glass. Nevertheless Boyle's method, if not his conclusions, approaches danger- ously near to Spinoza's at this point: he suggests a physical process analogous to known natural laws as explanation of a mystical doctrine central to Christian revelation. His literalism colors his whole attitude toward divine miracles and dis- tinguishes his view radically from Henry More's or John Howe's frank acceptance of mystery. Boyle viewed revelation as a whole much like the Platonists. Like them, he read part of the revelation of the true God directly from external nature, from the Book of God's Works. Like them, he believed that miracles, those miraculously asserted articles of faith, by "the way of Proba- tion" also testified to the Creator's benevolence. In Boyle's works we find the argument from de- sign in its most enthusiastic and informed ver- sions. The Usefulness of Experimental Philos- ophy, The Excellency of Theology Compar'd, in Of the High Veneration Man's Intellect Owes to God, and in The Christian Virtuoso, to name only his major works of this type, are his cumulative paean of praise of the wonders, the foresight, the fitness and the usefulness of all things-"the ex- cellent contrivance of the universe," by the study of which man's appropriate worship of God could be both confirmed and deepened. Boyle's authority for the physico-theological argument from design was so thorough and so impressive that, when William Derham gave the Boylean Lectures in 1711, he attempted "a Dem- onstration of the Being and Attributes of God, in what I call Mr Boyle's own, that is a Physico- Theological, Way." 4 Boyle's pre-eminence in the laboratory lent his "Physico-Theological Way" the prestige that distinguished it from the poetic physico-theology of More, for example, in his Antidote against Atheism. Boyle modified, too, 42 Spinoza, Correspondence, 361; Opera 2: 422. 43 Boyle, Resurrection, preface. 44 Boyle, Resurrection, 5, 16. 45 Boyle, Resurrection, 15. 46Boyle, Resurrection, 13, 30-31; see also below, ap- pendix IV. 47 Derham, William, Physico-theology: or, a demon- stration of the being and attributes of God from his works of creation, preface, London, 1716 (4th edition).</page><page sequence="19">VOL. 107, NO. 3, 19631 SPINOZA IN ENGLAND, 1665-1730 201 the conventional view of correspondence. Instead of regarding external nature as the mirror of man in the sense that the geocosm or the macrocosm were said to be the mirrors of the microcosm, Boyle considered nature a separate volume, as it were, providing testimony to God's providence different from that provided in instances involving human nature. Natural science was in its adoles- cence, even in the brilliant seventeenth century; for all his awareness of the problems still unre- solved in his empirical practice and theory, for all his willingness to proceed without solving all prob- lems, Boyle had no doubts about empirical verifi- cation per se. His work in the laboratory always "proved" or "disproved" something: nature was both evidence for and corroboration of the benev- olent God in whom he so deeply believed. His nature was the creation, the separate construction, of that God-Boyle never allowed his concept of deity to fuse with his notion of nature, as Spinoza deliberately had. As it was for More, Cudworth, or Baxter, Boyle's world was always an emanation of God, governed by His generous care.48 Like that of most physico-theologians, Boyle's epistemology was more naive than his physics. He subscribed to a form of innateness, redefining the principle of sufficient reason to a principle of fitness and appropriateness. Man's mind, formed in the image of God's mind,49 could understand as much of God as was proper to be understood and useful to human beings, by the "means and meas- ures" naturally furnished to it.50 Boyle's theory of knowledge was, then, both in its empiricism and in its fideism, basically anti-rational; he spoke for himself, certainly, in his radical modification of the Cartesian aim of knowledge: The other thing that I was to observe about the nature of the Mind is, that 'tis so constituted, that its faculty of drawing consequences from known truths, is of greater extent than its power of framing clear and distinct Ideas of things. ... He accepted the theological commonplace that of the greatest things of all, such as God, the mind can have no satisfactory conceptions, but simply has conviction that they exist.51 Scripture no- where promises man revelation of the whole na- ture of God: 52 the motive forces of His created nature are only limitedly intelligible to the natural philosopher, whose job is to determine what they are, not why and how they were established.53 Meanwhile, the "usefulness" of natural philoso- phy lies not just in its power to lead man into an understanding of God, but also, as Bishop Burnet said in his funeral sermon on Boyle, in its gift of knowledge by which man gets empire over the world for his own uses. Spinoza objected to this whole way of thinking, impatiently dismissing as fools all those who saw the universe as a "useful" instrument, constructed simply for them to enjoy and observe. For a man to settle down into an uncritical acceptance of the created world and its qualities was for Spinoza a sort of blasphemy. The God of his universe de- manded to be understood-where Boyle rejoiced in the ultimate mystery of faith, Spinoza rejoiced in the clarities of intellectual abstraction. By his strenuous and passionate logic, the effort due to the great God he postulated, Spinoza arrived at a confidence in God and an acceptance of His ways as thorough as Boyle's-and absolutely different. Both men trusted in the truth of the natural world, Boyle because for him it led into a deeper veneration of God, Spinoza because he could ex- press God's greatness by a method, icy and pre- cise, that arrived at axiomatic truth. Nature was for both men indued with deity, for both men nature was part of all human life spiritually lived, yet the relationships their systems postulated of God and nature were utterly different. Spinoza generalized the two into one, and insisted with his vigorous mathematical logic on their ulti- mate unity. Boyle worked more humbly, with physical nature first; the generalizations he made were not the result of deductive logic, since for him nature was always different in kind from the Creator. Where Spinoza could regard God and nature as one, Boyle had to work through nature to arrive at his idea of God. Spinoza's intransi- gent monism reflected the absolute singularity of his deity, totally in all things either conceivable or in existence. Boyle was a pluralist, his phi- losophy more flexible and therefore less complete than Spinoza's. Just as a man knew God only so far as his experience could take him, so could he know nature only as far as his experience could 48 Boyle, Usefulnesse, part II, 29. It is interesting to note that Boyle rejected in consequence the idea that man is a microcosm, parallel in physical construction to the universe, and that he reasserted the Scriptural description, against the microcosmic image, of a man created in the image of God. 49 Boyle, Things above reason, 20. 50 Boyle, Things above reason, 71. 51 Boyle.

COLIE [PROC. AMER, PHIL. SOC. take him. The connections between deity and nature were in Spinoza's system made one by the exercise of his extraordinary logical force; in Boyle's philosophy, their connections could only be known empirically-by what had happened in the past and what happens in the present. Both had their visions of a great and omnipo- tent God intimately involved with the created uni- verse, but where Spinoza rejected as unworthy all anthropomorphism of God, and thus even the concept of God's free will, Boyle conceived of him in the commoner and more communicable way of human (and of paternal) nature. It is typical, if not proper, that an empirical scientist, however wedded to the mysteries of Godhead, nonetheless should express his God in terms of the life he himself daily experienced. Boyle's religion, like John Locke's epistemology, was certainly human, humane, and reasonable-not primarily rational, but psychologically practicable, suited to man's capacities, "proportionable" to man's world and to most men's needs. Boyle's religion was, then, sufficiently general- ized to keep him out of the purely doctrinal quar- rels of his time: convinced Anglican though he was, he never entered into polemical defenses of his doctrine but sought rather to strengthen its central foundation by his sense of additional reve- lation. His scientific method of working toward truth by procedural unity lent force to his parallel desire for procedural unity in religion and led him thus to the advocacy both of a religion simple and plain and of general agreement on the funda- mentals of belief. Mindful of Spinoza's justified criticism in the Tractatus that no sight was more ironical than that of Christian divines attacking one another in the name of the Prince of Peace,5" he set up in his will a kind of safeguard against distraction among Christians, the annual Boyle Lectures, "for proving the Christian religion against notorious Infidels, viz. Atheists, Theists, Pagans, Jews and Mahometans, not descending lower to any controversies, that are among Chris- tians themselves...." 55 These lectures were a symbol of the re-estab- lishment of the English Church, relatively peace- ful after the Toleration Act by which Englishmen could live, if not in brotherly love, at least in civil peace. At the end of his life Boyle saw the great conflict in the English Church over the divinity of Christ and the nature of the Trinity: he wished to direct the attention of true Christians away from internal strife to the far greater dangers of atheism always lurking outside the church itself. Thus his lecturers were obliged to deal with the "no- torious Infidels" whose doctrines seemed to them most to contravene those of Boyle's church. And who are they? In effect, Jews and Moslems of- fered small threat to Anglicans safe on their is- land, but Hobbists, Spinozans and deists (the "Theists" of Boyle's phrase) were near at hand, and against them his lecturers launched their arguments. In the relation of Boyle himself to Spinoza we have seen the strong assertion of a religion generalized but not abstract; in Boyle's lecturers we can trace the steady secularization of the defense of religion against the really new philosophy. III. SPINOZA AND THE BOYLE LECTURERS The series of published Boyle Lectures 1 is an extraordinary index of official Anglican theology at the end of the seventeenth century and the be- ginning of the eighteenth. All the dangers the church faced, ecclesiastical, doctrinal, and philo- sophical, are recorded in one or another of these long sermons. By the terms of Boyle's will, the Lecturers (often types of the most successful clergymen of their period 2) preached either eight or sixteen sermons on the theme stipulated by the Founder. Since publication of their efforts was assured, the Lecturers were able, really, to write books, rather than sets of sermons; and they were careful to give full documentation to their points of argument. The result is that the Lectures, beginning in 1692 with Richard Bentley's set and running into the third decade of the eighteenth century, present with particular clarity the ideas upon which orthodox churchmen relied to defend their religion. From the Lectures, one can see at once the major threats to orthodox and liberal Anglican- 54 Spinoza, Tractatus, 6. 55 Boyle, Works 1: clxvii. 1 A defence of natural and revealed religion: being a collection of sermons preached at the lectures founded by the honourable Robert Boyle, esq; (from the year 1691 to the year 1732), [ed.

Socinianism,3 as Unitarianism was still called, was the system most often "refuted." Because of its refusal to accept the unique divinity of Christ, Socinianism could properly be regarded, in Boyle's own terms,4 as un-Christian. All the various threats to ecclesiastical unity and protestant peace of mind found some response in these Lectures, but Socinianism was the one most commonly denounced. With most of the orthodox, the Lecturers tended to think that "the peculiar distinguishing Charac- ter of this Age is a publick Denial of Religion, and all the Obligations of it, with an Endeavour to disprove the evidence brought for it, and to offer a more rational Scheme of Libertinism." 5 Earlier in the century, "libertinism" had meant merely the denial of conventional ethics, or "Epicurean- ism" in the popular sense, without reference to physics. But by the 1690's, libertinism was not just the "French" amorality generally attributed to the courtiers of Charles II and to the monarch himself; it was any systematic effort to be "free" of conventional ideas, particularly the idea of a deity. Libertinism often meant no more-and no less-than atheism. The word "atheism," on the other hand, was a word which had come into a more precise usage at the end of the century than it had earlier enjoyed. In 1600 an "atheist" was any conspicuous heterodox, and might even have been the expounder of a religion regarded as "en- thusiastick"-that is, he might be a person who made exaggerated or absurd claims for his God. Oddly enough, the messages of religious fanatics were often considered the equivalent of atheism, in an age when one could still distinguish the re- ligious fanatic from the orthodox believer. After the Interregnum, though, such distinctions were less automatically made-men were not called atheists for any theological peccadillo. They had to work harder to deserve the title; their meta- physics had to present a genuine threat to a personal God. Socinianism offered a "rational Scheme" which seemed libertine enough to good Christians. So did deism, after all, the generalized doctrine of God as an organizing First Cause, Who thereafter left the world to work according to the excellent natural rules He had laid down for it. At its ex- treme, deism denied the need for organized wor- ship of a deity doctrinally defined and confined; furthermore, deists themselves seemed too often allied with radical, wordly political and economic programs to be trustworthy 6-and they were es- pecially dangerous when, with all this radicalism, they still continued to show up in churches. Though many people were apprehensive about deists and deism, the descriptive terms remained fairly respectable. "Deism" implies the worship of a deity, not deliberate ignorance or denial of Him; though individual deists were in polemic often called atheists, deism itself was recognized as a theistic program. That program (if so varied a set of principles can be called by so stringent a name) denounced as superstition all the mysteries, miracles, and supernatural aspects of religions-all religions, including Anglican Christianity; and the deists sometimes went so far as to deny, with the Socinians, the supernatural quality and powers of Christ Himself. Deism strove to be an alto- gether natural religion: "natural" in uncorrupted "natural" man; "natural" in its reliance upon the orderliness of the physical world; "natural" as opposed to supernatural. Such a religion, that every man might reasonably entertain as his own, and that made few demands upon either his credulity or his purse, was-"naturally"-very attractive to a good many people. Churchmen came to respect, though they always suspected it, the appeal of deism, for it was more insidious than Socinianism. After all, Socinianism had always been a frankly nonconformist religion in England, where deism flourished among the Anglicans themselves. Collins, Toland, and Tindall were all, in their own eyes if not in those of their doc- trinal enemies, members of the Anglican Church.7 The enemies of deism were not far off the mark when they attributed deist heterodoxy to the ne- farious teachings of Hobbes and Spinoza. As Leslie Stephen pointed out, the Tractatus Theo- logico-Politicus contained most of the views gen- erally held by deists in the half-century following Spinoza's death. Neither the deists nor their opponents, however, were acute analysts of Spi- noza's philosophy-understanding of the positions of both Hobbes and Spinoza was highly confused, 3See MacLachlan, H. John, Socinianism in seven- teenth-century England, Oxford, 1951. 4 The principal anti-Socinian lectures were those of Kidder, Stanhope, and Woodward, but many other lectur- ers dealt in passing with the subject. 5 Gastrell, Francis, The certainty and necessity of re- ligion in general, preface, ii, London, 1697. 6 Colie, Spinoza and the early English Deists, Jour.

Ortho- dox arguments tend to repeat themselves: anyone well read in the polemics against Hobbes and Spinoza finds the same arguments outlined, even the same phrases used, that had served orthodoxy against any and every enemy. It is impossible (and probably invalid) to isolate the specifically anti-Spinozist arguments of the Boyle Lecturers, since they chose to regard Hobbism, Spinozism, and deism as a common body of thought rather than as separate systems, and too often responded to all three systems as to one. Over and over again, we read the argument from design, such as Derham's, in "Mr Boyle's own, that is [the] Physico-Theological, Way," demonstrations of the being and attributes of God, in particular of His providence; over and over again, we find the assertion of revelation known through the token of a divine miracle. Sometimes Socinians, sometimes deists, sometimes Hobbes, sometimes Spinoza, are supposed to be downed by these mighty examples, so authoritatively presented. If it were not for the extensive annotations of the preachers themselves, it would often be impos- sible for the modern reader to know which enemy was the temporary target for the polemical arrows. Interestingly enough, though Hobbes' name of- ten and automatically appears accompanied by the names of black Epicureans and deists like Blount, Collins, and Toland, only four of the Lecturers- the same four that attempted serious analysis of Spinoza-attempted to deal at all profoundly with Hobbes's ideas. For Harris, Hancock, Clarke, and Gurdon, moreover, Hobbes appeared more like himself than Spinoza like himself; for the English reader, Hobbes's works spoke far more easily for themselves than the crabbed Latin of Opera Postuma. Since Spinoza was a figure so much defined by his opponents, often indeed made up by them, examination of the arguments against him, rather than those directed against Hobbes, provide considerable insight into the tensions and bugbears of orthodox English thought. John Williams, later Bishop of Chichester, was the first of the Lecturers to deal with Spinoza by name, in his Lecture series of 1695-1696.8 He directed his attention chiefly to the Tractatus, that carrier into other minds of Spinoza's "infectious" Biblical criticism. Williams had very little to say: like Henry More, Richard Baxter, and John Howe, he reiterated the truth of revelation against the specious assertions of Spinoza. He made one interesting point, however, the implications of which he did not seem to perceive, in his discus- sion of Spinoza's critical objections to Scriptural "truth." Spinoza was, in his life and in his writings, spectacularly antitraditional; the dar- ing of his attack upon Scriptural veracity had obscured for his contemporaries some of the im- plications of his method. As Williams saw, that method actually called all traditional documents into question-called into question, in fact, all the writings, legal, economic, even belle-lettristic, of the world.9 Historians do not customarily regard Spinoza as having been the servant of their disci- pline, and certainly Spinoza himself did not recom- mend the study of that undisciplined subject as an end in itself. All the same, his historicist exami- nation of Old Testament texts, in their cultural environment, contributed to the cultural relativ- ism that ultimately permitted history to become a decent occupation for the thinking man. Williams, deeply rooted in a conventional profession and a conventional country, speculated upon what would happen if the Spinozan method were applied to all texts-contracts, leases, Magna Carta, for instance; or laws canon and civil, Roman, Nor- man, or Anglo-Saxon. All of them could be shown to be corrupt or contingent texts, just as Spinoza had shown the books of the Old Testa- ment to be corrupt or contingent. Such a view of tradition robbed all institutions of their support -and to Williams, such a position was, simply, absurd. Williams' discussion of Spinoza is conventional and rather random. Francis Gastrell, who fol- lowed on Williams in 1697, was a careful reader of the Spinozan text, who set out to prove by systematic examination the atheism of the philoso- pher. Gastrell was not utterly conventional in his own beliefs, either.10 He defended the unity, immutability, intelligence and eternal necessity of the self-existing God because "[t]his seems to me to be the easiest Notion of God we are capable of conceiving; and if it can be proved that there really is such a Being as is here describ'd, I think 'tis all that's necessary upon this Subject...." 11 8 Williams, John, The character of divine revelation, 10, London, 1695. 9 Williams, The truth of holy scriptures, 19, London, 1695. 10 Yolton, 184-185, gives another example of Gastrell's efforts at conciliation. liGastrell, The certainty and necessity of religion, 17-18.</page><page sequence="23">VOL. 107, NO. 3, 1963] SPINOZA IN ENGLAND, 1665-1730 205 "The easiest Notion of God we are capable of conceiving" is an expression dangerously close to deist economy, plain, common-sensical, inclusive -and a dangerous basis from which to attempt refutation of Spinoza. Gastrell went on to say: For whether we represent God to our Thoughts as a pure and simple act, a spiritual Substance, or subtle Matter; as the whole mass of Substance of the World taken all together, or as the Soul and active Principle of it; as confined to the Heavens, or diffused through the whole extent of Being; as the Maker and Creator of all things, or as the Principle and Fountain from whence they flowed; or consider him under any other Idea our Reason or Imagination can prove; if we allow all the Characters of a Deity before men- tioned, 'tis the same thing, as to Religion, which soever of these Opinions we embrace....12 He accepted among the divine attributes the in- finity-that is, the infinite variety-of God, as well as His eternity and spatial infinity; and noted, evidently without horror, that some men affirmed the world to be an emanation of God and others "that the World, and every thing we see or know, is God." 13 Up to this point, Gastrell's argument might permit Spinoza's metaphysics; the Spinozan eth- ics, though, were too much for him, and he at- tacked their ethical relativism by affirming true and immutable morality, of the Cudworthian vari- ety, of which each man was conveniently provided with "some natural Notions," or innate ideas." The necessary God Spinoza postulated involved a necessitarian morality; though men might have freedom in their way of conceiving God, Gastrell could not permit a like freedom in their behavior: 'Tis the same thing, in effect, with those that make God a necessary Cause, and Men necessary Agents: For, according to this Opinion, all Actions are alike, as being equally necessary, and all Men must obey their own Determinations; and there can be no gen- eral Rules or Principles for Men to act by; there is no such thing as Obligation, Reward, or Punishment: nor have any of those Notions or Distinctions, taken away by Atheism, any place or foundation under this Hypothesis.15 Two years later, in 1699, Gastrell published a continuation of his Boyle Lectures, in which he further separated himself from Spinoza; he drew a clear line of descent for deism from Spinoza, who, with Hobbes, intended "to undermine the Common Faith of Christians." Spinoza, Hobbes, and the deists were, he thought, necessarily thwarted in these undermining efforts by the very breadth of the interpretations their doctrines per- mitted. In spite of themselves, "there's nothing directly held by either of them, that, if it were allowed to be true, could infer any thing to the prejudice of the first general Principles and Proofs either of Natural or Revealed Religion." 16 Spi- noza's belief that miracles proceeded from natural causes, some of them still unknown to man, in no way prejudiced the validity of Scriptural reve- lation; his attribution, for example, of Old Testa- ment prophecies to the particular temperaments of the prophets involved, did not necessarily alter the truth of the prophecies they uttered. Even if, as Spinoza claimed in a particularly modern and historical insight, the Jews continually saw God's intervention in human affairs merely because their culture prepared them to see that, the revelation of their belief was not invalidated by that anthro- pological fact.'7 Human beings are relative, are contingent, to each other and to the God whose creatures they are. God can reveal Himself to human beings only in terms they can comprehend, and they can report their revelation no more defin- itively than their capacities allow. That the rec- ord of revelation is imperfect, moreover, does not "prove" that revelation did not take place, any more than the variations in copies of Magna Carta invalidate the fact of the charter or the arrange- ments stipulated in it. Since Francis Gastrell did not believe that any man could possibly be an atheist,'8 he had to be gifted in the art of accommodation. In his view, men might be misguided, might pursue wrong methods, as Spinoza certainly had done in his Tractatus and in his mathematical method of presentation,'9 but ultimately even wrong theories could be interpreted, by a good theologian, to the ultimate glory of God. John Harris, who delivered the Boyle Lectures in 1699, was quite opposite to Gastrell.

SOC. he believed that any man who pretended "to Deism and Natural Religion" was "in reality" an Atheist; 21 and for his purposes, to this group belonged "Machiavel, Spinoza, Hobbs, Blount." 22 After "confuting" Hobbes by means of the argu- ment from design, with generous reliance upon Cudworth, Bentley, Ray, and other physico- theologians, and demolishing Blount's Oracles of Reason by means of Bentley's Boyle Lectures, Harris attacked Spinoza upon the question of God's substance. Following Hobbes in the Epicu- rean notion that "there is no other Substance but Body," Spinoza had postulated a corporeal as well as a cogitative God: "Deus est res extensa." 23 If, as Harris paraphrased his notion, Spinoza had held that "Motion is Coeternal with, and Essen- tial to Matter, and the Deity be Matter thus Eternally moved," it would follow that "Every Particle of Matter must be essentially God, or else he must be the result of the whole, or of some Parts of Matter combined together." 24 Harris saw Spinoza as the reviver of Lucretian atomism, which Boyle's pious corpuscularianism was de- signed to mollify. But Spinoza himself never asserted directly such Epicureanism, of course: he held rather that all substance was essentially cogitative and extended, and that there was but one substance in the universe.25 In an effort to avoid just such misinterpretation as Harris made, Spinoza had laid his stress upon the infinity of substance and the identification of that substance with the infinite God. For Harris, of course, pantheism was an improper, even an unthinkable, answer to the question of the duality of spirit and matter. He attacked, furthermore, the supposedly nominalist basis of the Spinozan notion of a sub- stance without properties. Such an idea is "only a Metaphysical Notion, only a general Word or Term.," from which we can form no idea of the God with which it is identical, who thus becomes "nothing at all but a meter Name, a meer Ens Rationis, or Creature of the Brain only." 28 Harris' objections to Spinoza are really prac- tical: like Gastrell, he could not bear the impli- cations of Spinoza's necessitarian morality. If God were really one with matter, then He exercised no control over that matter. To present Him as corporeal, moveover, "Subjects Him to a Physical Necessity, makes Him nothing at all but Nature, and deprives both Him and us of the Noble Principle of Freedom of Will." 27 From this he concluded that Spinoza's Chief and Primary Design to banish out of Mens Minds the Notion of Moral Goodness, . . . and there- fore tho' he was resolved to Introduce absolute Neces- sity into all Actions both Divine and Human; yet it should be such an one as should leave no Umbrage for any distinction between Good and Evil, or any Foundation for Rewards and Punishments.28 With the Pythagoreans, the Platonists, the Stoics and, most conclusively, with Locke, John Harris insisted on man's right to freedom of will." 29 So far, conventional enough: this was the position of More, Cudworth, Whichcote and Smith; this was the lesson of Paradise Lost. But something had happened by Harris' entry into the argument-his defense of free will derives not so much from Scripture as from philosophical sources. Harris could not really take revelation for granted on its own authentication alone; he needed to support revelation with philosophical explanation and justification. In the battle against secularization, secularization itself had become a weapon. "O that mine enemy had written a book"-so that I might refute him, is a sentiment perfectly human but utterly unwise. No one who has ever written against anyone has failed to be influenced by the book he opposed, if only in the emphasis and order of his thought. By the time the next commentator on Spinoza, John Hancock, preached his sermons in 1706, the emphasis had shifted, not merely from metaphysics to practical concepts, as we have seen in the work of Gastrell and Harris, but from religious morality to the conduct of secu- lar life. Hancock discussed Spinoza's faults as help to explain his practical orientation in these lectures. In 1696 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, where he sat for a time on the Council and served a year as Secretary. During his London tenures, Harris lectured on mathematical and scientific subjects, and taught privately at home. He wrote and collected ex- tensively in the field of the mechanical arts. 21 Harris, John, The atheist's objection, that we can have no idea of God, refuted, 7, London, 1698. 22 Harris, Immorality and pride, the great causes of atheism, 20, London, 1698. 23 Spinoza, Ethics II, prop. ii; Harris, The atheist's objections, against the immaterial nature of God . . . refuted, 9. 24 Harris, The atheist's objections, against the imma- terial nature, 36-37. 25 Spinoza, Ethics I, prop. xiv. 26 Harris, The atheist's objections, against the imma- terial nature, 47-48. 27 Harris, The atheist's objections, against the imma- terial nature, 49. 28 Harris, A refutation of the atheistical notion of fate or absolute necessity, 6-7, London, 1698. 29 Harris, A refutation of the atheistical notion, 12.</page><page sequence="25">VOL. 107, NO. 3, 1963] SPINOZA IN ENGLAND, 1665-1730 207 secular faults, in secular terms. Spinoza was hyp- ocritical; 30 he was Epicurean; 31 he was immoral in the Hobbist manner. Oaths sworn to needed no keeping, contracts could be abrogated. More- over, he had revived, in Cudworth's phrase, "the old Hylozoick Hypothesis, (with some absurd Ad- ditions) that Life, Sense, and Understanding is essential to Matter." 32 A God who is nature lies "under a Necessity of nature to do all he can do," and cannot "do any thing otherwise than he does,"33 forbids the obedience and worship of man. Just as Baxter had earlier presented the dilemma, Hancock put it plainly: if he made us, and could not help it; he preserves us too, and cannot help it; and (it may be) must reward us, or ... punish us, and cannot help it: In this Case, what are we beholden to him? or what Duty can we owe or pay to him? 34 If we ourselves are without will and do what we do simply out of necessity, what honor to God to have made us, what honor to us in our lives? God and man together dragged out a weary life in the universe Hancock attributed to Spinoza. The chief English attack upon Spinoza was made in 1704 and 1705 by Samuel Clarke, at that time the principal figure in English philosophy and its selected champion against Leibniz' criti- cisms. 35 Alone of the lecturers, Clarke treated Spinoza as an important philosopher, not just as an atheist whose foolish arguments could be met with stock physico-theological orthodoxy. He was, significantly, unafraid of many of the prob- lems raised by Spinoza's formulations, which most critics wisely ignored. The Spinozan notion of God's infinity, for example, which had sent critics over the logical and metaphysical abyss more than once, Clarke dealt with fearlessly.36 Clarke's view of Spinoza was nonetheless limited by the general views of his time and con- text. He saw in Spinoza's "Necessity of the Di- vine Nature" the same dangers that Harris and Hancock had seen. For him, Spinoza's God was the world: . . .the Opinion of Spinoza, when expressed plainly and consistently, comes evidently to this: That the Material World, and every Part of it, with the order and manner of Being of each Part, is the only Exist- ent, or Necessarily-Existent Being.37 Clarke's own definition of an infinite, eternal and omniscient deity, omnipresent, unchangeable, in- corruptible, and indivisible, denies to that God the attribute of motion, with its implications of finite- ness; from this flows his refusal to accept Spi- noza's God: From whence we may observe the Vanity, Folly, and Weakness of Spinoza: who, because the Self- Existent Being must necessarily be but One, concludes from thence, that the whole World, and every thing contained therein, is one Uniform Substance, Eternal, Uncreated, and Necessary: Wheras just on the con- trary he ought to have concluded, that because all things in the world are very different one from the other, and have all manner of Variety, and the Marks of Will and Arbitrariness and Changeableness, (and none of Necessity) in them; being plainly fitted with very different Powers, to very different Ends; and distinguished one from another by a diversity, not only of Modes, but also of essential Attributes, and consequently (so far as 'tis possible for us, by the use of our present Faculties, to attain any Knowledge at all of them) of their Substances themselves also. 38 The question of the Parmenides has been raised anew: Spinoza attempted the rigorous definition 30 Boyle lectures 2: 202-208. 31 Boyle lectures 2: 209. 32 Boyle lectures 2: 225. Hancock's reliance upon Cudworth in this matter did not extend to acceptance of Cudworth's principle of plastic nature, to him as unneces- sary as Spinoza's supposition that "the World itself is a great Animal, or . . . a God" (Boyle lectures 2: 209). 33 Boyle lectures 2: 248. 34Boyle lectures 2: 249. Most of the Boyle lecturers took their cue from Boyle himself, and praised Des- cartes, even if occasionally it was observed that his doc- trines pointed to greater dangers to religion than Boyle seemed to have foreseen. Not so Josiah Woodward, the lecturer for 1710, who plainly saw an Epicurean world lurking behind the Cartesian scheme: "The Wit of Des Cartes, who dress'd up this Dream with many Flourishes of ingenious Fancy, has undone many. It is evident, that Spinosa took the Hints of his Atheistical Principles from this French philosopher. But Des Cartes was too discerning to believe in it at Spinosa's Length. He plainly asserts the Being of Almighty God, and grants that He gave Being and Motion to all Things in Nature. But here we see the Disingenuity of some modern Cartesians, who follow their Master where they think he leads Man from God by some precarious No- tions, but barely desert him when he brings them by true Reasoning to God's Being and Government" (Boyle lectures 2: 508). 35 Clarke, Samuel, A collection of papers, which passed between the late learned Mr. Leibnitz, and Dr. Clarke, London, 1717. 36 For Clarke, the reality of infinite space had been es- tablished by Newton, upon whose metaphysical assump- tions Clarke based his own theory, systematizing the occasionally unprofessional lapses in Newton's metaphys- ics.

COLIE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. of a demonstrable and undeniable monism, which subsumed, among other modes, the mode of mo- tion. Made uneasy by that solution, but quite certain of the reality of motion, Robert Boyle had adopted a pluralist view of the universe. Clarke, however, required both the one and the many- the attributes of his God were more carefully de- fined than those of Boyle's God. Nonetheless, mo- tion, variety, and change clearly existed in the material world, and Clarke's system had somehow to account for them. His solution at this stage is pretty: it was the changeableness of things-in- themselves that served to underscore for him the greatness, the independence of God's will-not, as for Spinoza, the regularity of those changes. To prove his own orthodoxy (which more con- servative divines had challenged), Clarke pro- duced a fully documented argument from design, proved and approved by Newton and Boyle.39 His solution to the problem of motion shifted: since the principles of motion in matter must have been established by an intelligent first cause, exer- cising his free will, those principles must be regu- lar, however arbitrary their initial establishment. Still, God may always demonstrate His intelli- gence whenever He wills. The rules of all mo- tions have not, in spite of Newton's enormous achievement, been opened to the human mind; they may turn out to prove that the Creator's providence is a continual exercise of His intelli- gent will. In trying to establish the rule that in- telligence, to be true intelligence, implies liberty, Clarke created a serious problem for himself, but he was trying to avoid the pantheist identification of God with matter, which, he was convinced, robbed God both of intelligent will and power, as well as equated the operations of the natural world with the will of God. Such intelligence as Spi- noza granted God is invalidated, according to Clarke, by Spinoza's own hypothesis: when Spi- noza and his followers "speak of the Intelligence and Knowledge of God; they mean to attribute these Powers to him in no other sense, than the antient Hylozoicks attributed them to all Matter." 40 The physical world, the Boylean-Newtonian universe, is not simply the result of either arbi- trary or disseminated necessary "intelligence"; its "fitness"y is consistently demonstrated by "the Beauty, Order, and Well-being of the Whole" to be "Wholly the Effects, not of Necessity, but of Wisdom and Choice . . . by a Free and Wise Agent." 41 Earth and skies are subject to change, as modern observation demonstrates. As for final causes, defended by Boyle and dismissed by Spi- noza as "the Fictions of ignorant and superstitious men," they certainly exist: the eye is made to see, the ear to hear, the sun to give light. Natural philosophy constantly adduces proof of the prin- ciple: "the larger the Improvements and Dis- coveries are, which are daily made in Astronomy and Natural Philosophy; the more clearly is this Question continually determined, to the Shame and Confusion of the Atheists." 42 God's prescience is part, not only of His will, but also of His knowledge. Here again, Clarke sharply diverged from both Spinoza and Hobbes. Man's will, like God's, is free: God's prescience, since God is omniscient, naturally knows the manners of man's freedom and its results, but God's foreknowledge does not imply any mecha- nistic control over the course of human events.43 Like all the thinkers of his age, Clarke was forced to relate the question of evil to the great benevo- lence of God. He derived, like Milton and the Whig moralists later, specific moral evils from man's abuse of liberty, to the end merely of human self-corruption, not to any diminution in God's infinite perfection and infinite goodness. Just as God's prescience remained absolute in spite of man's poor choices, so was His wisdom absolute in spite of human ignorance and foolishness. The wisdom of God, His providence and omniscience, are everywhere manifested in a creation inevitably and inherently good. Only man's peccadilloes sometimes mar that creation, and even man can be saved. Clarke's Demonstration went into many edi- tions and was often reprinted with his second series of Boyle Lectures, Discourse Concerning the Unchangeable Obligations of Natural Re- ligion, and the Truth and Certainty of the Chris- tian Revelation. Because his reputation as the fit spokesman for English orthodoxy was so great, his reading of Spinoza dominated the early and mid-eighteenth century. Samuel Colliber, for in- stance, who differed from Clarke on other philo- sophical points, adopted his view that Spinoza was as thorough-going a determinist as Hobbes.4 39Clarke, The being and attributes of God, 58-60. 40 Clarke, The being and attributes of God, 63. 41 Clarke, The being and attributes of God, 66. 42 Clarke, The being and attributes of God, 69. 43 Clarke, The being and attributes of God, 102-107. 44Colliber, Samuel, An impartial enquiry into the ex- istence and nature of God, 33, 38, London, 1718.</page><page sequence="27">VOL. 107. NO. 3. 19631 SPINOZA IN ENGLAND, 1665-1730 209 For the indefatigable William Carroll, however, who saw Spinoza and Spinozan atheism wherever he looked in English writings,45 Clarke was inade- quately orthodox. Carroll called Clarke to ac- count precisely for his refutation of Spinoza-on the psychologically contradictory grounds that Clarke had misquoted Spinoza and had thus un- fairly dealt with him, and that Clarke's own con- clusions too often ran parallel to Spinoza's to per- mit of a genuine orthodoxy. Otherwise Clarke's reasoning was the British bulwark against the Spinozan threat. When in 1721 and 1722 Brampton Gurdon delivered the Lectures, entitled, The Pretended Difficulties in Natural or Reveal'd Religion no Excuse for In- fidelity, he followed Clarke in ignoring Spinoza's supposed followers, the deists, and in concen- trating upon Spinoza himself. In Gurdon's view, Spinoza had successfully replaced Hobbes as the philosophical exponent of systematic atheism. Spinosa is the only Person among the modern Atheists, that has pretended to give us a fairly regu- lar Scheme of Atheism; and therefore I cannot act unfairly in making him the Representative of their Party, and in proving the Weakness and Absurdities of the Atheistick Scheme, by shewing the Faults of his: tho' I shall not entirely confine myself to the Examination of his Scheme, as not to shew occa- sionally, that every other Scheme that leaves out the Religious Notion of a GOD, will be liable to great Absurdities." The material implications of Spinoza's unity concerned Gurdon profoundly. Though he, like Clarke, agreed with Spinoza "that there is but One Principle of all things," his principle was very different from Spinoza's. Gurdon's God had cre- ated the world from nothing and separate from Himself, while Spinoza made no separation be- tween substance and attribute, between extension and thought.47 For Gurdon, that God of Spi- noza was a self-contradictory being: [Spinoza] must make his Self-existent Being the Sub- ject of all contradictory Inclinations and Passions which are met with in Mankind; for if there be no Creative Power, there will be no other Way in ac- counting for the Existence of Things, but by deriving them from the Substance of the Self-existent Being: But also such Derivations can be nothing but so many different Modes, as himself confesses, of the Divine Substance; and consequently, the Souls of Men, all their Thoughts and Passions, will be only different Modes of the Divine Being, And therefore will be GOD, and not Man (for his is only a Mode of the Divine Being) that thinks, affirms or denies, loves or hates, so often as Man seems to do either.48 Though Gurdon could grant with Spinoza that in- finite Being was able to produce all the infinite possibilities of being, he was too much a ration- alist to allow of contradiction in God, even in His attributes or the Modes of His being. Human behavior disproves Spinoza's thesis that all things are in God, according to Gurdon. If God is in all things, or is all things, then perforce He must be in all men however they behave and misbehave, cooperate and quarrel. And if every- thing is of God and has the power of cogitation, then each particle of each man must be equally able to cogitate. To reduce this to logical ab- surdity, Gurdon posed this choice: do the atoms themselves choose to act independently, or do they choose one atom and invest it with the power of acting for all the other atoms? A precarious no- tion, jocularly and whiggishly asserted, particu- larly if some of the atoms should desire to retract their consent to the government.49 The nature of the body of man, with its essen- tially cogitative parts, seemed also to invalidate the Spinozan denial of an afterlife. Borrowing an argument from Locke, Gurdon maintained that, since a man's consciousness of his own being does not change with the flux and reflux of the elements of his body, that consciousness cannot be affected by the "death" of the body-which is the logical preparative for the miracle of the resurrec- tion. "Thus we see that giving the Spinosist what he contends for, he is yet as far as ever from gaining what he chiefly aimed at, and which he could not hope for in Religion, viz Rest and Im- punity after he is dead." 50 So Spinoza's refusal to accept the miracles of Christ-the raising of Lazarus and His own resurrection-falls to the ground. Gurdoia quoted an anecdote, apocryphal, to be sure, from Pierre Bayle's famous dictionary arti- cle on Spinoza, dealing with this very point: If we may believe Mr. Bayle, Spinosa himself acknowledged, if he could have believed the Matter of, Fact of Lazarus's being raised to Life again, after 45See [Carroll, William], A dissertation upon the tenth chapter of the fourth book of Mr. Locke's essay, concerning humane understanding, London, 1706; Re- marks upon Mr. Clarke's sermons . . . against Hobbs, Spinoza, and other atheists, London, 1705; and Clarke, Samuel, The being and attributes of God, preface.

COLIE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. he had been really dead, that he would have given up his System of Infidelity, owned our Saviour's Mission to have been from GOD, and embraced the Christian Faith.51 He even tried to rehabilitate Spinoza in the eyes of the Christians by citing the letter to Oldenburg, in which Spinoza had reported his view that the apostles sincerely believed in the resurrection. After considerable searching, Gurdon could no- where "find that Spinosa doubted, whether the Apostles were sincere Persons, and spoke what they believed to be true." 52 The relativist im- plications of this remark ring oddly from a de- fender of Anglican orthodoxy. With Gurdon, as we can sense, the whole tone of English anti-Spinozism has changed from the anger aroused in More and Baxter in the 1670's and 80's. Gurdon's ironic calmness extends al- most to include Spinoza, "the only Person among the modern Atheists, that has pretended to give us a regular Scheme of Atheism." With a little good advice, a little persuasive preaching, Gurdon implies, even Spinoza might have been converted to the true religion. Gradually the atheist-even when considered most particularly an atheist-has become recognized as a theist; though that word was in disfavor, it meant something far better than "atheist." Spinoza's heterodoxy, though radical, had become sufficiently domesticated to bear the scrutiny of the orthodox, and, almost, their patronage. Very noticeably, by Gurdon's time, refutations of Spinoza in the Lectures had ceased to rely on Scriptural references, and directed themselves more and more to the purely metaphysical or to the ethical questions raised, sometimes indeed even to simple matters of logic. Among the various pressures upon orthodoxy that turned it away from sectarianism-weariness with ill-tempered controversy among Christians, perhaps; certainly the rise of an empirical scientific attitude together with widespread related historicism-was the purely philosophical pressure exerted by those thinkers who considered their own religious meta- physics outside the frame of doctrinal orthodoxy: in short, by Descartes, by Hobbes, by Spinoza.53 On the one hand this philosophical pressure permitted the deists to consider religious and moral matters outside the domain of the estab- lished church; on the other, it forced orthodox divines within the establishment to defend their position by nondoctrinal means. Spinoza's reason- ing could not be thwarted simply by triumphant reiterations from Scripture, even when Scripture could be supported by Cicero; his metaphysics was understood to require metaphysical refuta- tion. In fine, Spinoza had to be taken seriously as a thinker. Gurdon could not say, as Cud- worth had been able to so long before, that Spi- noza was not worth refuting; he was obliged to put his trained mind to the problems Spinoza raised and to enlighten listeners who genuinely wanted to hear something about the subject it- self, not just against it. In the course of this, orthodox doctrine itself became radically simplified, and it more and more took its strength from philosophy. Philosophy itself became orthodoxy-the weapons of meta- physics and physics used to counter deist and mechanist arguments became inseparable from orthodoxy itself. The teleology of Boyle's argu- ment from design became ever more rationalized, until even teleology, stressing God's will and prov- idence, grew very like the determinism of mech- anist philosophy. Indeed, religious questions from 1700 to 1730, as agitating as questions about the nature of the Eucharist had been a century and a half earlier, were questions of physics, of mat- ter, motion, and particles. Spinoza, who posed the great test for the orthodox, succeeded in phi- losophizing theology, precisely at the point when theologians were ready to pit their postulates against his. Clarke and Gurdon, sophisticated clerics that they were, no longer shuddered at the blasphemy in Spinoza's denial of miracles. They heard ordinary deists doing as much every day, after all. Nor was the attack upon Scriptural authority an extraordinary challenge for them, as it had been to Henry More and his like-minded friends. The questions the Boyle Lecturers dealt with were philosophically more profound-of first and final causes, of matter and motion; sec- ondarily, of moral and social implications-and the way to refute their enemies was to meet them on their own grounds. Since their terms had be- come so secular, Boyle's Lecturers had reached a point where, within the very language of Boyle's will designed to prevent just what they were doing, they concerned themselves far more with theism than with the Christianity the Founder had obliged them to defend. 51 Boyle lectures 3: 363. 52Boyle lectures 3: 363. 53 Mr. Yolton's book on Locke's Essay demonstrates how a philosopher's modes of thought gain domination over the minds of men who devote their efforts to re- futing him.</page><page sequence="29">VOL. 107, NO. 3, 19631 SPINOZA IN ENGLAND, 1665-1730 211 APPENDICES HITHERTO UNPUBLISHED WORKS OF ROBERT BOYLE RELATING TO SPINOZA AND THE DISCUSSION OF MIRACLES APPENDIX I. Royal Society, Boyle Papers III, "Religion is a thing.. f. 105 Religion is a thing of that Importance to the highest Interests of men, that no diligence in makeing Inquiry into the Arguments whereon we build our choyce of it is to be esteemed super- fluous, and therefore I neither wonder at nor blame your Curiosity, (which is not yours alone), to know what moved me when I was confin'd to one Argument in favour of the Christian Religion, to make choyce of that which may be drawne from the Miracles that attested it. I mention my being confin'd to One, that you may not suspect that I would either deny, or in the least derogate from, the Validity of those other Arguments, that have been judiciously urg'd by the more learned Champions of Christianity. But the Occasion of my Discourseing of this Subject, restraining me to select some one among the several Proofs, that may be rationally offer'd for the Christian Re- ligion, I thought none fitter than that drawne from Miracles. And indeed; That the Consider- ation of Miracles is an Employment that well de- serves a great measure of Attention, will not be difficultly granted by him that shall observe that Philosophers themselves, do justly esteem the study of Nature above most other Sciences: and yet the Objects of Physicks are but the workes of Nature, wheras true Miracles are Operations Supernaturall. Nor are they only more sublime that the Objects of naturall Philosophy, but of greater Importance to us, since the Knowledg &amp; Use of Corporeal things dos chiefly relate to our Bodies, &amp; usually reaches but to this Life. Whereas to have a right Judgment of Miracles &amp; their consequences is of very great moment, if not [f. 106] necessity, to direct us securely in make- ing our choyce of Religion, which is the impor- tantest action of our Understanding, &amp; on which very much depends, besides, the solid Happiness of the Soul in this Life, the endless felicity of the whole man in the Life to come. I therefore looke upon Miracles as Subjects exceeding worthy of a deliberate Inquiry, as well as the attentive Consideration of them is a Taske difficult enough to exercise our most serious &amp; contemplative thoughts. But the subject being too large &amp; difficult to be fully treated of without Launching into Philosophicall Speculations, &amp; per- haps Controversies too; I, who am sensible of my want as well of ability, as of leasure, to ex- patiate into so comprehensive a Subject, will, in compliance with both, confine my selfe, as I lately intimated I would, to consider Miracles only as they are alleagd (as Proofes) in favour of the Christian Religion. Nor shall I undertake to say, all that may be pertinently said on this Subject it selfe; but shall only tender to you those Thoughts of mine, that may be conveniently enough referd to three or four Heads, my designe in this Essay being but, (1) to shew you in gen- eral why I thought fit to pitch upon the Argu- ment from Miracles rather than any other (2) By selecting one miracle, among many that offerd themselves, to give you a particular instance of the force of the Argument that may be built on the numberous miracles of Christ &amp; his Apostles. And then (3dly) To vindicate the way of Proba- tion it selfe, or the Argument built on Miracles, from some Objections whereto it may seeme lya- ble. I will begin then with the Motives that in- duced me to make choyce of the Argument drawne from Miracles, &amp; tell you that I was invited to prefer it before any one other [simp]ly by the ensueing Considerations. [f. 107] 1 And first; True miracles are the proper &amp; greatest Proofes, that the Message or Doctrine that is attested by them, is indeed a Divine Reve- lation. For natural Theology convinceing us of the Goodness, Providence, &amp; Veracity of God, those Attributes will not suffer us to beleive, that he would permit a Falsity, &amp; that such an one as the Publishers of it ascribe to his Inspiration to be ratifyd by so extraordinary a Testimonial, as a Miracle wrought in confirmation of it. And if we shall suppose the Doctrine or Message pro- posd to proceed really from God, what more proper course shall we thinke on to procure it the assent &amp; entertainment it deserves, than his authorizeing of it by the supernatural effects of his Power, especially since the wise &amp; Immutable Author of Nature cannot reasonably be presumed to alter the Course &amp; breake the Lawes of it but for some particular and which is usually declared,</page><page sequence="30">212 ROSALIE L. COLIE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. either by the native tendency of the Miracle, or by the Person employd to worke it. 2. I consider in the next place, that to informe men by Miracles, is a way of teaching men worthy of God. For great Monarchs &amp; Law-givers are not wont to speake to their subjects (like a Master to his Scholars, or a Philosopher to his Disciples) for these inferior Instructors are faine to employ Syllogisms &amp; Perswasions to those they address themselves to, because they have not any more forceible Arguments to worke on them, and there- fore their Auditors have a right to employ the like Arguments, &amp; sometimes stronger, against their Instructors. But the Argument from Mira- cles is a Demonstration of so high a kind, that it can be made use of by none but God, or those whome he immediately Commissions and enables. All rati[onal] Creatures may instruct one another [f. 108] by the Productions of their Reason, but the Creator only can teach by a Production of Omnipotence. And therefore it may be justly askd in Elihu's Phrase, who teaches like Him? [Job, 36. 22] And the Apostle, writeing to his Corinthians, might warrantably postpose (as he did) the perswasive Arguments of Humane Wis- dome, to that way of Preaching employd by him, where the Doctrine he taught them was attended &amp; attested by the miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghost on which account, he stiles that way of Preaching a Demonstration of the Spirit &amp; Power; (the genitive there denoteing the Agent) and justly adds, that by this meanes twas intended that the Faith of Beleevers should not be founded on the Reason of man, but on the Power of God. 3. I farther consider that Miracles are not only proper &amp; noble Instruments, whereby [to] au- thorize an instituted Religion, but are [f. 109] necessary ones to convince, that it proceeds from God. For tho tis not to be denyed, that there is a natural Religion, whose Principles being con- genite with us, or easily deducible from the Con- templation of the Universe &amp; our selves, has no need of Miracles to recommend it; yet since an Instituted Religion as such, pretends to be founded upon supernatural Revelation, &amp; comprises not only a discovery of Truths relateing to the Object of Worship, but Rites of Worship, if not also Rules of Life; tis plaine that there must be some supernatural way to ascertain wary men (&amp; there is nothing wherein wise &amp; good men will be more wary than in the choyce of their Religion) that this way of honouring God is really instituted by him. For tho the Holyness or Goodness of the Doctrine, &amp; some other Excellencies that ennoble the Institution, may well be allowd to make it probable, that a Religion may proceed from God; yet since we know not how far Vertuous Prin- ciples &amp; Intellectual Judgments may by morality &amp; Philosophy, be improved to frame excellent In- stitutions; it cannot without Miracles be proved that it dos proceed from God. And the Etablish- ing of Religion being the great act of Legislation exercisd by God towards men, tis hard to con- ceive, how the Promulgation of his positive Lawes can be authentickly made without a supernatural Testimony to convince those that are to receive and obey them. 4. This Consideration prompts me to inforce it, with another, which is, that men seem, as it were naturally, to expect Miracles from those that pre- tend to establish a new Religion; since almost all Religions [tha] t have pretended to Divine In- stituti [ons] have also (tho most of them very falsly) [f. 110] pretended to Miracles or Divine Revelations, which themselves indeed are Mira- cles, being supernatural Operations designd to acquaint men with something about the mind of God, which otherwise they would not have cer- tainly knowne. And this Pretense of Religions to the haveing been authorizd by Miracles, might be easily shewne by the Enumeration of divers Eth- nick, &amp; other wayes of Worship, if I thought that needfull to be done. 5. I consider in the next place, that the Argu- ments from Miracles, is a most proper way for the Divine Wisdome &amp; Goodness to employ in refer- ence to the differing Capacities of Men. For Re- ligion being designed by the Author &amp; Lover of Mankind for the benefit of the generality of men, th6 some other kind of Proofes might have been proper for some souls of Men, yet those same Arguments would have been improper for others. Had the Heralds of the Christian Religion for in- stance employed metaphysical Speculations, or sublime Philosophical Discourses; they might in- deed have pleasd &amp; convinc'd some Philosophers, but could not have been understood by far the greater part of mankind, who for that very reason would have been tempted to mistrust them of some conceald Fallacy. Besides that the various Prej- udices, Passions, &amp; even of Learned Men are such, that tis very hard, to convince them indefi- nitely even of divers Natural Propositions, which one would thinke to be very demonstrable, &amp; which eminent writers pretend to have been actu- ally demonstrated. For oftentimes what one [man</page><page sequence="31">VOL. 107, NO. 3, 1963] SPINOZA IN ENGLAND, 1665-1730 213 tak] es to be a manifest Truth; another looks [upon] but as a meer Hypothesis; a third, [as an] Error; &amp; a fourth perhaps as an [f. 111] Absurd- ity. And if on the other side the Promulgators of the Gospel might have prevaild with the ignorant &amp; illiterate vulgar, but would too often have been despised &amp; exposd to be cavilld at by Learned &amp; subtile men. But Miracles are such Proofes of the Truth of what they attest, that ordinary &amp; even mean Capacities are capable of discerning the force of them: and the greatest Scholars &amp; Wits cannot but submit to it. For in altering the Course, &amp; Surpassing the Power, of Nature, Gods Interposition is too conspicuous not to be seen even by vulgar Eyes &amp; rever'd by the most pierc- ing and Lyncean ones. 6. And to proceed now to another Consideration, this fitness of Miracles to worke on Mankind, is little more acknowledgd by them that beleeve them, than by those that oppose them. For if Miracles have no great Efficacy to prove the Doctrines whereto they give suffrage, whence is it, that Atheists &amp; Infidels doe so studiously &amp; Industri- ously endeavour to take off the Credit of the Historical Narratives of them; &amp; busy themselves much more to prove the matter of fact to be false &amp; Incredible, than the Inference they afford in favor of Religion to be illegitimate. APPENDIX II. Boyle Papers III, Letter on Mira- cles ("Mr. Boyle's answer to Spinoza") f. 112 Sr I perceive that you have been lately told by N.N. and his Friends, that I have some uncom- mon sentiments about divers of the Miracles re- corded in the Holy Scriptures; and that I look upon severall of those supernatural Phaenomena, as not being so Repugnant to the Laws of Nature, or perhaps not Receding so far from them, as men are wont to conceive. Wherefore I hope you will allow a Person, that is highly concern'd to stand right in your opinion, to give you himself a sum- mary Account of his present Thoughts, whereby you may know what credit to give to the Rela- tions you have receiv'd from others: especially, ther being few men so knowing, so impartial, and so candid, not sometimes to mistake, or, which is worse, to misrepresent, the Notions they are un- accustom'd to; particularly about nice and dark subjects, that require much Attenti[on] of Mind, as being of difficult Speculation. And I hope I shall find my work somewhat [the] more easy, because not only N.N. and his Friends, [but y]ou your self also, are Embracers of the Cartesian [Philo]sophy: since on this ac- count I may expect to fi[nd you] both less preju- dic'd against my Opinions for their being un- common, and more willing, as well as more able, to examine them. [f. 112v] In the first place I shall inform you that by the word Miracles, that you will often meet with in the following Discourse, I understand those strange &amp; wonderful Operations, Productions, and Phaenomena, that surpass the setled or common Course of Nature in some such manner, as that upon the whole Matter they cannot justly be at- tributed either to Nature left to her self, or to the skill, Power, frauds, mistakes, or credulity of men. I begin with this Declaration, partly to decline being unnecessarily engag'd to dispute about the Distinction between Divine Miracles strictly so call'd and other stupendious things that to most men seem to be supernatural; and partly that by explaining what I mean, I might obviate that Darknes and those Mistakes, which I have ob- serv'd to proceed from the very confus'd Notion men commonly have of Miracles. In the next place I desire you would take notice th [at] I do not at all deny, but that there may be, nay and [have been] Divine Miracles properly so call'd; that is such as cannot with probability be suppos'd to proceed from any other than the Fi[rst] Cause, that is from God. For, that the supream Being may, if he thinks fit, perform things above the Powers, and contra[ry] to the Laws, of Corporeal Beings, th6 befriended by man himself; I think may be justly inferr'd from the Consideration of the boundles Perfectnes, and (if I may so speak) of the Primenes of his nature. For, as he is the Creator of Matter, and the sole Introducer of local Motion into it, so all the Laws of that Motion were at first arbitrary to him; and depended upon his Free Will: on whose account he might if he had pleas'd, have infus'd into, or (if you please) confer'd on, the whole mass of matter that he created, either a farr greater, or a far less, measure of Motion, than now it has. And he might also have setled other Laws of the Communication or Transmission of Motion from Body to Body, than those that now obtain in the Univers. As, instead of a hard Bodies [f.</page><page sequence="32">214 ROSALIE L. COLIE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. 113] communicating it's whole Motion to another Body equal to it, that it hits against, and finds lying at rest; he might have appointed that the Movent should impart but halfe it's motion to the Moveable. Wherefore th6 the Supream Author of things, has by establishing the Laws of nature determin'd and bound up other Beings to act ac- cording to them, yet he has not bound up his own hands by them, but can envigorate, suspend, over-rule; and reverse any of them as he thinks fit. I know there have been of late two or three Persons, much cry'd up by some witty men, than sound Philosophers; who admitting a Deity and a Providence, yet deny that there have been, or can be, any true Miracles; grounding their denial on this; That it would argue want of wisdom and foresight in God, to establish such Lawes as he might afterwards be oblig'd, or see cause, to make void or alter. I might to this Objection very speciously op- pose the concurrent suffrage that has for many Ages, and is stil given to that Assertion which it impugns, by the generality of men of almost all Religions; Christians, Jewes, Pagans, and Ma- hometans. But, th6 I look upon this, in this par- ticular case, as no despicable Argument; yet I have other Reasons to alleage for the Opinion attack'd by the propos'd Objection. I say then, as has been already noted; that God is a most free Agent; and his Divine Wisdom does accompany all that he does, in such a man- ner, as not to impair his Freedome; but concur to accomplish the Exertions or Issues of it, in the best manner that is possible. And, th6 I do not only grant, but have elsewhere endeavour'd to prove, That God may have made some things in the world for some ends among others that are knowable by Us; yet I think we dim-sighted men presume too much of our own Abilities, if we dare, as some do, magisterially determine; That the great God, the most Free &amp; Omniscient Au- thor of Things, can have no Ends, to which it may be congruous, that some of the arbitrary Laws he has establish'd, in that little portion of his Workmanship that we men inhabit, should now &amp; then, (th6 very rarely) be control'd or receded from. [f. 114] I come now to that which I mainly intended to observe, which is, That God being as well the Author of the Laws and course of Nature, as of those supernaturall Phaenomena usually call'd Miracles: it becomes the profound veneration we ought to have of the Divine wisdom, so to in- terpret the passages of the holy-scripture, wherein these wonders are recorded; as to make the natural order of things no more overrul'd, sur- pass'd, or receded from, then is absolutely neces- sary to make out the truth of the Relations, as they are delivered by the inspir'd Historians. This consideration appeares so congruous to reason it self, that many would think it an im- pertinence if I should lanch out into a great dis- course, to prove it. And indeed; as 'tis generally and justly granted, that God being a most wise as well as supream Legislator, dos not work miracles, (which do as it were repeal, or controul, or suspend, the Laws which he himself establish'd in nature &amp; without weighty reasons: 'tis rational to conceive that he dos not even in working mira- cles, overrule or exceed those Laws any further, then is necessary for the production of the super- natural effects design'd: since any further re- cession from those Laws, seems, for so much, not to be accounted for by the same weighty reasons that may be given for the Miracle it self, ab- stracted from the additional recess newly men- tion'd. And to this Opinion I am much the more inclin'd, because I observe, that in divers pas- sages of Scripture, where Miracles are registred, God has been pleas'd to express a manifest regard to the stated Lawes, and usual course of things: and seems as it were to husband his omnipotence, by suffering naturall causes to performe some part of the work (and perhaps as much of it as they are able) and [f. 114v] forbearing to display his Almighty power, save in those parts of it, that must necessarily be miraculous, because they require a power surpassing that of ordinary na- ture. Thus when he would bring innumerable swarmes of Locusts to infest, and punish Egypt, he brought an East wind upon the Land for a whole day &amp; night, and the East wind brought the Locusts. And when upon Pharao's submis- sion and Moses' intercession, he was pleas'd to re- move that pest; the text informes us that he did not annihilate them, but sent a might strong west wind, which took away the Locusts, and cast them into the Red Sea: whereas when he took away the frogs, that were unfit to be so carried away, he caus'd them to dye in the houses, and the Fields, and left it to the Egyptians to rid themselves of their carcases; which they could not</page><page sequence="33">VOL. 107, NO. 3, 1963] SPINOZA IN ENGLAND, 1665-1730 215 so do, but that, as the text relates, the Land stank. Thus when he employ'd a strong East wind that blew all that night to divide the waters. [f. 115] And here I desire it may be consider'd, that even among those things which men agree in judging to be done according to the Ordinary course of Nature, severall things come to pass, otherwayes then would be perform'd by vertue of the Mechanical Laws that obtain among things meerly corporeal. This, th6 perhaps you have not hitherto needed it, you will be in[vi]ted to grant, if you reflect upon what your Friends the Cartesians teach, about the Operation of the ra- tional soul or mind, upon the humane Body. For th6 they forbear, (as indeed Experience compells them) to ascribe to the mind a power of exciting Local Motion in matter, or communicating it to the Body; yet they give it a Power to determine &amp; direct the motions of the Animal Spirits, and by their intervention at divers of the Limbs and other parts of the Body. But I confess I see not by what Mechanical Law or power, an imma- terial Creature can at pleasure alter the determi- nation of the motion of a Body; and make it move forwards, backwards, upwards, downwards, to the right hand, to the left; in a word, in I know not how many differing wayes. The Determination of a Body in motion, is as naturally the effect of Mechanical Laws as the motion it self; and cannot according to the course of things meerly corporeal, be altered, but by the scituation and the resistance of some Body that it meets with in its way. And consequently, if it otherwise [be] chang'd, it must be so, by some other power then meerly Mechanical: and such various determina- tions of motion as men arbitrarily make, when they draw Pictures, or trace the Letters of Char- acters belonging to differing Languages; as He- brew, Greek, Arabick &amp;c do curb and over-rule the motions which the Penn or Pencill would have, if the humane mind, th6 an incorporeal sub- stance, did not interpose. [f. 116] That the Regular Operations of Nature are by the most wise Creator directed to Determinate Ends, I have in another Paper endeavour'd to evince. But tho I there acknowledg, and am stil of Opinion, that severall of those Operations are so excellently fitted to those Ends, that divers of the Purposes of God are discoverable or know- able by Men; yet I think we presume too much of our own abilities, if we imagine that the Om- niscient God can have no other Ends in the framing and managing of Things Corporeal, than such as we men can discover. And therefore I cannot look upon it as neither respectfull or safe, to conclude, that God can propose to himself no Ends that would not be incongruous to his w[is]- dom, &amp; yet be capable of inducing him to alter the orderly course that himself has establish'd among Natural Things. [The] unsearchable wisdom of God, being alwayes accompanyed [by] his Al- mighty Power, may have Reaches, if I may so [speak], far beyond what we purblind mortals are able [to think]. And therefore in this case it is more safe, as [I think], to conclude Affirmatively than Negatively; and [to say that] such a thing is one of Gods Ends, as for instance, That [the] Manifestations of his Glory, and the Communi- cating of [his] Goodnes are some of his Ends in Creating the World, &amp; [all] in it: the means being so very Apposite for these Ends; [than] it is to say That God cannot recede from the Laws he has once setled in Nature; and so, that he can- not work any Miracles, because we see not for what Rational End it can be that he should recede from these Laws, by Repealing, Suspending, or otherwise Altering them. APPENDIX III. Boyle Papers III What is meant by Miracles or, Phaenomena supernatural [f. 117] The Distinction between the Fundamental Lawes, and the ordinary course of Nature. The Distinction between the Ordinary course of meerly Corporeal Nature, and Nature directed by Intelligent Substance or Agents. That 'tis not deny'd but there may be Divine Miracles, strictly so call'd. That God being the Author of the Laws &amp; course of Nature as well as of Miracles, he allow us so to explicate them when we fairly can, as to make their Recessions from the Fundamental Laws, and even from the ordinary course of Na- ture, to be no greater than we must necessarily admit especially some Examples or proceedings of his own intimating, and as it were, warranting us to use this caution.</page><page sequence="34">216 ROSALIE L. COLIE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. That something supernatural does yet violate no Laws, [or the] Course of Nature. That divers things may be explicated by barely alter[ing] the Determinations of Motions, or ac- celerating or retardations already begun. That we should distinguish between change[s in Nature, e]specially effected by one Portion of it acting upon [another, and] changes of the Es- sential Nature of Things. So that Mir [acles] may quite otherwise modify a Portion of Matter, but [not] the Essential Nature of Things th6 their Existence be destr[oy]able by Annihilation.

APPENDIX IV. Boyle Papers III [f. 102] Show in the Paper against Spinosa that we ought not to confound all things that may be ef- fected with mechanicall Powers whatever the Agents be that sett them on worke and that we cannot conclude a thing to be no miracle meerly because tis possible to be produc'd by matter &amp; motion. And illustrate that by white thornes that are by the Gardiners art made to beare plumbes and other fruit (whose cyence or buds are grafted or inoculated upon it which by the course of Na- ture they never would bare.) And soe a watch may be made to stricke one, immediately after it has strucke twelve, or twelve immediately after it has strucke one. th6 according to the course of nature in the Watch or if you please according to the genuine constitution or disposition of the Engine this will never happen for th6 the effect be produc'd by the locall [motion] of the wheels and other parts of the watch congruously to its contrivance yet such a motion had never been produc'd in it if the regular motion had not been over rul'd by the efficatious action of a designeing Agent. Tis much less rationall to argue thus. Miracles cannot be true because there is noe God (by whom they must be wrought) then to argue thus wee see that Miracles are wrought therefore there must be a God (or a supernaturall &amp; intelligible being) to worke them. For the first ratiocination sup- poses something that cannot be prov'd, but by metaphysicall or other difficult and at least very questionable arguments, whereas the latter ratioci- nation supposes nothing but what men generally grant namely that our sences are to be trusted about their proper objects and that there is a common degree of morall honesty to be met with among men in things where 'tis not their interest to be dishonest. They that owning the Scripture deny there can be Miracles contradict those many passages wherein Miracles are urged by Christ himselfe and his Apostles as fit Instruments to convince men of the truth of the doctrine and as grounds whereon their Incredulity may be justly aggra- vated and reproach'd. To which may be added that God himselfe sent Moses with a signe to con- vince Pharao. The grand objections against our Miracles are, That there [f. 103] can be no true miracles be- cause there is noe God who is suppos'd to have wrought them; That if there were Miracles, 'twould not be possible to distinguish the true from the false nor consequently prove a particu- lar Religion by them; That the Christian Religion wants the proofe affordable by Miracles (sup- poseing there to be true ones.) As for those Christian writers that oppose the Argument from Miracles, besides what I else- where answere to their objections, I shall here ob- serve that they doe not properly reject all proba- tion drawne from Miracles but only that which is drawn by Heretickes or Magicians against a truth already sufficiently prov'd &amp; solidly establish't. For when they say that 'tis foretold that Anti- christ &amp; some Imposters will worke Miracles to seduce severall men from the truth, and that there- fore we are not to beleeve them for the sake of the signes they show as I observe (without question- ing at present the sence of the Texts they alleage) that those very predictions whereto their argu- ment shows that they scruple not to give their Assent are themselves miraculous things since su-</page><page sequence="35">VOL. 107, NO. 3, 19631 SPINOZA IN ENGLAND, 1665-1730 217 pernaturall knowledge, and I say further that tis easy to perceive that their Arguments suppose the Religion from which they ought not to let Mira- cles seduce them to have been already so firmly establisht that nothing ought to be able to pervert them from it. But so establisht, it was not, nor indeed could have been without the seal of true miracles as well as the Congruity of the Doctrine with the rightest notions that Reason can furnish us concerning God and Divine things. Soe that the Adversaries I now speake of, reject not the power from Miracles indefinitely, and on the same ground that Infidells doe since they admit them as good Arguments at the first establishment of re- veal'd Religion which being once settled upon the Testimony of Miracles and right Reason, they thinke it is not just that Miracles alone should withdraw men from a Religion so evinc'd to an- other Religion that will have alwayes somewhat of right Reason, especially considering that such subsequent Miracles, haveing been foretold, with warneing given men to beware of them such wonders may well be looked on not as effects of the primary intention of Divine Providence but as tryalls of mens faith, constancy and watchfulness.

Boyle Papers III, ff. 108-110 About the Miracle wrought on Whitsunday [in Boyle's hand] The Method, Theophilus, I have hitherto fol- low'd, leads me to the Consideration of what Your friend alledges against the Possibility of the Mira- cles recorded in the Gospell. And this if I mis- take not, is indeed That, the clearing of which would the most conduce either to convert or at least to convince him. For I have severall times observ'd, (&amp; soe perchance have You) that as our Criticall &amp; Philologicall Infidells, are wont to make their cheif Exceptions at the way or manner wherein the miracles that beare witnes to the Christian Religion are deliver'd &amp; attested: soe the more Philosophicall &amp; Atheisticall Enemy's of Religion, are wont to make it their grand objec- tion, &amp; upon which they principally rely, that the things themselves recorded are impossible; &amp; therefore ought to be look'd upon as incredible; And indeed I cannot wonder that they bend their cheifest Endeavours to make good this Assertion; it being both their last Refuge &amp; their strongest Hold. For the more considering sort of these Unbeleiving discerning well enough, (&amp; com- monly fare better than other Infidells) the Co- gency of the Argument drawne from Miracles, &amp; its Advantages above most if not all other Argu- ments usually imploy'd to assert Religion: there is nothing that they appear more concern'd &amp; in- dustrious in, than to enervate this Argument, be- cause what ever may be sayd touching the In- ferences from it in favour of the Christian Religion</page><page sequence="36">218 ROSALIE L. COLIE [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. in particular, the Admission of Miracles would mistify Religion in general &amp; conclude against the Atheists who reject both all Religions &amp; all su- pernaturall Powers. Now considering men (such as Your freind would be thought) can scarce misse discovering, that nothing of any great mo- ment can be answer'd to the plea from Christs and his Apostles Miracles but one of these two things, either, That though they may be true, they are incompetently attested, or else, That they can- not rationally be thought true, whatever testi- mony they come attended with: I mean (that I may expresse this yet more plainly) either First that the Narratives are not to be believ'd, be- cause the Testimony of the Relators is not such as is sufficient in the nature of a Testimony to bring credit to Things that though not impossible are exceeding strange. But because it seemes very unsafe to venture their cause upon the hope of disproving soe full &amp; strong a Testimony the Phil- osophicall Atheists chuse rather to fly to the other member of the Distinction, namely, That (2.1Y) the Testimony tho: competent in its kind, &amp; fit to exact an Assent to things that were possible, is not here to be believ'd; because the things related were impossible to be done: and consequently, with whatever recommending Circumstances the Testimony comes attended, we may . . . conclude that the Relators either had a mind to deceive others, or were themselves deceiv'd: Since what is impossible to be done is unfit to be beleiv'd who- ever they be that pretend they have seen it done. And the ground of this Impossibility, is, that tis confess'd on all hands, that to the working of miracles there is requir'd the imediate operation either of a God, or of some intelligent &amp; potent supernaturall Agent, which that there should any exist or be, according to the Objectors, [is] an utter Impossibility. APPENDIX VII. Boyle Papers III, Discourse on Miracles f. 120 If it be objected, that by this distinguishing Miracles into true or false, according to the na- ture of what they are brought to bear witness to, &amp; by choosing what kind of Miracles, we would be convinc'd by, we do in effect make the Argu- ment drawne from Miracles, insignificant or use- less. I answer, that in regard divers (for I say not all) of those supernatural things that are wont to be accounted Miracles, may proceed from two extreamly differing Causes, namely God &amp; the Divel, it is necessary to consider the nature of the Doctrines for which Miracles are vouch'd, that we may not pierniciously mistake Diabolical workes for Divine Miracles. And if it be re- plyed, That however by way of proceeding, we do not judge [of] the Miracles by the Doctrine whereunto it be[ars] witness I rejoin that this Objection is grounded upon a mistake. For I do not thinke we should determine that this, or that determinate matter of Fact is to be asserted or denyed upon the account of the Doctrine tis em- ployed to attest; nor yet, that a Miracle, com- petently attested, ought to have its authority re- jected because it agrees not with this or that particular Article of this or that particular Reli- gion: But I thinke the use we ought to make of a Doctrine in judgeing of a miracle is not to deny the Historical part, if it be substantially attested, but to distinguish whether it be likely to come rather from some evill Spirit, then from God. Nor do I hereby evacuate the use of Miracles; for I allow all those that can be made out to have God for their Author, all the Authority that their divine extraction can confer on [f. 121] them; and I allow them (both) to determine my choice, as to the main of Religion, as Christianity, Ma- hometanism, Heathenism &amp;c and to command my assent to the particular Articles that are mani- festly containd in the main of the Religion these Miracles bear witness to. But tho till I be duely satisfyed that the Miracles themselves are Divine and not Diabolical, I must in reason refrain from acknowledgeing them: yet I pretend not to judge which of these two the Miracle is by the Articles of any particular instituted Religion, as the Chris- tian, the Jewish, or the Mahometan; because that Religion it selfe must be proved, by miracles to have been divinely instituted. But for this ex- amination I take only the general Principles of Natural Reason &amp; Religion, which teacheing me antecedently to all particular Revelations, That there is a G[od], That he is, &amp; can be, but One; That [he] is Just, Wise, Good, Gracious &amp;c; and Tha [t] he has the Care and Government of Hu- mane Affairs; if a supernatural Effect be wrought to authorize a Doctrine that plainly contradicts these Truths, I cannot judge such a Miracle to be divine, and therefore am not bound to suffer my selfe to be swayed by it. But if the Revelation backd by a Miracle proposes nothing that contra-</page><page sequence="37">VOL. 107, NO. 3, 19631 SPINOZA IN ENGLAND, 1665-1730 219 dicts any of these Truths, taught us beforehand by right Reason; &amp; much more if it proposes a Reli- gion that illustrates and confirms them; I then thinke my selfe oblig'd to admit both the Miracle, and the Religion it attests. And upon the score of the Truth of a Religion so authoriz'd; and so in- deed upon the score of Gods veracity, I embrace all the particular Articles &amp; Propositions, that I find, to be manifestly contain'd in the Revelations whereof [f. 122] that Religion consists. Thus I first assent to a Natural Religion upon the score of Natural Reason antecedently to any particular Revelation. And then; if a Miracle be wrought to attest a particular Doctrine concerning Reli- gion, I endeavour, according to the Principles of Natural Religion &amp; right Reason to discover whether or no this proposd Doctrine be such, that I ought to looke upon a Miracle that is vouch'd for it, as comeing from God or not. And lastly if I find by the Agreeableness of it to the best notions that Natural Theology gives us of God &amp; his Attributes, that this Religion cannot in reason be doubted to come from him; I then judge the Body of the Religion to be true. And if in any thing that is obscure or doubtfull in that Religion, a Miracle should be wrought to decide the difficulty, I would submit to that Decision and not judge the miraculous matt[er] of Fact com- petently attested, to be false [be] cause 'tis re- pugnant to some preconceived Opinions of mine about this or that disputable Article of that Religion. But this is to be understood of the Miracles that are wrought in favour or a Religion when 'tis first proposd to be embrac'd, especially if that Re- ligion be for the main the Antientest, or the first that was authoriz'd by Miracles. For when a Religion has been once solidly establishd by a competent number of true &amp; uncontrould Mira- cles, then I have a new Criterion to judge of a subsequent Miracle by; for the veracity of God being founded upon his Justice &amp; Goodness (three Attributes knowable to us by the Light of Natural Reason) it is not to be suppos'd that he would contradict himselfe, and so reveal his will to man- kind, as inevitably [f. 123] to lead them into in- extricable difficulties concerning it: And there- fore also, 'tis not to be suppos'd, that the subsequent Miracle proceeds from him unless it be controld by a greater Miracle: as in the case of the Egyptian Sorcery and Moses; Simon Magus and the two Apostles Peter &amp; John; or unless God permit it to try men which may rea- sonably presum'd in case some express praediction were made that such lying Miracles should be suf- ferred to be wrought for that end. And upon that ground it might reasonably be said by Paul (the Apostle of him that had foretold, that false Christs &amp; other Seducers should arise with lying wonders to seduce if it were possible the choicest Chris- tians) to the Galatians, that if either he or an Angell from heaven should teach them another Gospell, that is another Religion for the main, then [if he] had taught them, and then was, as is intimated in the same Epistle, Authoriz'd among them by signs &amp; wonders &amp;c, they should reject him, knowing that (as the same Apostle else- where speakes,) even Satan may, by Gods per- mission, transform himselfe into an Angel of Light.</page></plain_text>
