<plain_text><page sequence="1">Latin Narrative Syntax in Virgil and Milton Jeremy Richard The Latinate qualities of his diction and syntax are commonplaces of Milton criticism. But the extent to which Milton uses the particular syntactic structures of the classical language for describing action in narrative English verse remains an open question. Because Paradise Lost insists on the unique importance of its subject in the framework of world history, it describes events on planes more complex than the solid battlefields and seas of Virgil. Even so, Milton adapts the conventions of Latin literary epic style in ways that determine the actual meaning of his Christian epic. Readers of Virgil's Aeneid will remember the vivid, though dreamlike ending of Book Six. Aeneas' visit with his father's shade in Hades draws to a close. Anchises, Aeneas, and the guiding Sibyl have left the spirit of Marcellus as he waits to be born to his doom. It is the last direct conversa- tion in this book; abruptly, a narrative voice takes control: . sic tota passim regione uagantur aeris in campis latis atque omnia lustrant. quae postquam Anchises natum per singula duxit incenditque animum famae uenientis amore, 890 exim bella uiro memorat quae deinde gerenda, Laurentisque docet populos urbemque Latini, et quo quemque modo fugiatque feratque laborem. Sunt geminae Somni portae, quarum altera fertur cornea, qua ueris facilis datur exitus umbris, 895 altera candenti perfecta nitens elephanto, sed falsa ad caelum mittunt insomnia Manes. his ibi tum natum Anchises unaque Sibyllam prosequitur dictis portaque emittit eburna, ille uiam secat ad nauis sociosque reuisit. 900 Tum se ad Caietae recto fert limite portum. ancora de prora iacitur; stant litore puppes.'</page><page sequence="2">194 The Journal of Narrative Technique (. . . Thus they wander throughout that region over the broad fields of air and inspect everything. And after Anchises took his son over every item and inflamed his spirit with desire for the glory to come, he later reminds the man of the wars which will then need fighting and informs him of the tribes of Laurentum and the city of Latinus, an in what way to flee and what burdens to shoulder. There are twin gates of Dreams, of which one is said to be of horn, by which an easy exit is given to true visions, the other, shining, made of white ivory, but through it the Underworld sends false dreams up to the earth. Having finished his instructions Anchises sees off his son and the Sibyl and sends them out by the ivory gate. Aeneas sets his path and rejoins his comrades at the ship. Then he sails in a direct course to the harbor of Caieta. The anchor is dropped from the prow; the sterns are beached on the shore.) This passage falls naturally into three sections. Lines 886-892 relate the am- bulatory last teachings of Anchises to his son; lines 893-898 describe the gates of dreams and Aeneas' passage through the gate of ivory; lines 899-901 bring Aeneas back to his crew's moorings and send them on to Caieta. But such a bald analysis fails to account for the amazing shift in tone of voice that occurs in this passage. The structure of the first line approximates the wanderings of the two men in the Elysian vales. The opening statement, tota passim regione vagantur, seems specific until the next phrase with its apparent inner contradiction-fields of air-knocks the physical base out from under the men (as a region is a place in which one can stand) and replaces it with airy nothingness. The last phrase is a marvel of imprecise connotations. Most likely it means that they took note of everything (though in this shadow world of death one can of course not be sure that one is seeing in the ordinary sense). But omnia is one of the vaguest words commonly used in Latin; even res has a rather more exact matrix of meanings --"affairs" or "situations' '"-while omnis can be applied to either animate or inanimate objects, situations, or states of mind. And lustrant implies the process of examination rather than the resulting illumination. A back-formation from lustrum, an expiatory sacrifice, the word came to be associated with the movements of the priest as he inspected the victim and was used by Cicero to suggest wandering and observing-with no specified result. In this sense the word has prophetic and ritual connota- tions. Aeneas and Anchises are not so much "seeing everything" as they are attempting to "see into everything." The diction of the line is purposely vague, not because Virgil wishes to suggest blandness, but rather shifting qualities. Vagantur shares in this quality as Virgil himself uses the word to mean "digressing' in other contexts. Passim does not provide a specific direction and the word aeris brings us to one of the four basic elements-</page><page sequence="3">Latin Narrative Syntax in Virgil and Milton 195 but to the one difficult to see and impossible to grasp. The sound of the words also contributes to a lack of direction and clarity. A total of seven s sounds in the two lines (passim would have been pronounced with both s's sounded) is backed up by I and r sounds and is finally played off the staccato of the ts in a way that will remind modern readers of Eliot's "tedious argument/Of insidious intent." In both cases, the consonants sug- gest a liquid, potentially instable medium and reinforce the ambiguity of the words themselves. The elision of atque omnia further underlines the sliding, shifting scenery of the dream-world. Even the syntax of the passage is strangely indeterminate for Virgil. In so short a passage-not two full lines-one might expect one major verb with others placed in dependent clauses. Instead we have a simple paratactic use of two verbs of action, each with the same person, mood, number, tense, and voice. The effect is such that one wavers between the verbs, unsure which action to emphasize, which to subordinate. The mood of indecision and dreaminess continues as we overhear An- chises' advice to Aeneas. "Overhear" is perhaps not the correct word, for we have only a program of topics to be discussed, without knowing what is actually said on each issue. Though promising to examine each in- dividually (per singula), Anchises provides only vague descriptions--glory, wars, and burdens. Even when names are mentioned--Laurentine, Latinus-we do not know if they are enemies or allies. Nothing is specified; all is truly prophetic in its vagueness. The four main verbs-duxit, incendit, memorat, and docet-are all related in meaning and each controls its own clause, balancing the others, so that no one stands out as revealing the ultimate meaning of the sentence. All parts are equal and the reader has no central focal point. This insistently one-dimensional structure, used here with great effect, is uncommon in classical verse. One expects it rather from the verse of the Vulgate or from Augustine's prose. It is as if Virgil were passionately afraid of surrendering anything definite to the reader. Although we stand at the axis of the epic, looking for signs of what is to come, we hear only that Aeneas will both fugiatqueferatque-total balance of meaning, down to the colorless -que enclitics. This moment of ambiguity leads to the transitional second section. "There are twin gates of Dreams"-rarely has Virgil sounded so like the Vulgate in a kind of vatic utterance ("sunt lacrimae rerum" is another ex- ample of such studied simplicity). The tense changes back to the present, but now it is not just the historical present of lines 886-87 or 891-92. The present tense here functions to generalize this information: there were two gates then, there still are, and there will continue to be. They appear unan- nounced in this vision as though they had literally materialized in front of Aeneas only when they were needed, to give him a ground in space if not in time. What immediately catches our eyes, however, is the quarum: the next clause is linked to the first by a relative pronoun. We are back in a familiar syntax of tight Latin verse where parts of sentences are organic parts of an idea. The logical chain continues as that subordinate clause has another subordinated to it-again the relative link in qua. The sentence fur- ther develops with an altera . .. altera backbone. Not only is the syntax</page><page sequence="4">196 The Journal of Narrative Technique logical but the words themselves express definite ideas. The prophetic tone is no longer as important as the descriptive. The gates are physically de- scribed and likewise their moral properties are analyzed. When we come to the last two lines of this section we again find two verbs in a paratactic ar- rangement (appropriate for our last glimpse of Anchises as vates), but this time they follow one another in a chronological order. Emittit gains further strength from its cradled position: by splitting the phrase portaque . . . eburna, the verb keeps the reader in suspense about which gate the travelers are exiting through. Because of the moral importance given to the ivory gate in the previous line, that phrase helps to mold and clarify the shape of its own line. Nothing is more striking than the sudden burst of physical energy once Aeneas is back above ground. No further psychological states are examined as we see him externally taking command. Now paratactic verbs follow a chronological order: he must set his path to rejoin his comrades. As the ship sails and then is docked, one can almost see the direct sunlight and hear the shouted orders in contrast to the shady and shifting light patterns of the underworld and the moanings and oblique utterances of its spirit popula- tion. In an almost cinematic technique the focus moves back and away from the hero's questioning and doubting facial expressions to a panoramic view of the coast of Sicily and of the Trojan fleet, once again safely moored. But now at last the sacred influence 1035 Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav'n Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins Her fardest verge, and Chaos to retire As from her outmost works a brok'n foe 1040 With tumult less and with less hostile din, That Satan with less toil, and now with ease Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn; 1045 Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air, Weighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold Far off th' Empyreal Heav'n, extended wide In circuit, undetermin'd square or round, With opal Tow'rs and Battlements adorn'd 1050 Of living Sapphire, once his native Seat; And fast by hanging on a golden Chain This pendant world, in bigness as a Star Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon. Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge, 1055 Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.2 The above passage and that analyzed from Virgil share a certain number of parallels. In each, one of the main characters of the epic, having spent time in the underworld, wends his way to earth. As in the Aeneid, this voyage of the character marks a change between planning (thinking, digressing, plotting, interviewing-all inactive states) and doing (as Satan</page><page sequence="5">Latin Narrative Syntax in Virgil and Milton 197 sets about to tempt the new creatures and Aeneas leaves off love-making and game-playing to found Rome). In each case the character is unsure of what lies before him: compare Aeneas' doubt as he passes through the ivory gate with Satan's "Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek/What readiest path leads . . ." (1I:975-76). Both passages are crucial moments and pivotal points in the narrative structures of these epics. Each passage likewise follows a pattern of movement away from vagueness and toward precision. When Satan is deep within Chaos' ter- ritory he encounters "Rumor next and Chance,/And Tumult and Confu- sion all imbroil'd,/And Discord .. ." (11:965-67). Satan indeed has a dif- ficult time on this journey, but what stands out about it is how little we see of him. Milton has a nervous touch with the imagery and language of this passage. Nothing remains constant for long. Thus, in the lines immediately preceding our selection, Satan leaves the personified Chaos with a definite movement-a spring upward. But his struggle with the elements is not described according to his own person; Milton uses several classical allu- sions, comparing him to the Argo in the Bosphorus and to the ship of Ulysses between Scylla and Charybdis. Milton has anticipated Eliot's use of the objective correlative-the eye-catching metaphor that is related to its subject by its emotional or psychological aptness rather than by its dislocating physical dissimilarities. Satan certainly does not look like either of those ships, but is in an approximately similar physical situation, and perhaps in an emotional situation very similar to that of the ships' crews. Before this passage begins, Milton digresses into the future, foretelling the broad highway that will one day lead to Hell. On our return, the center of attraction is no longer Satan but his surroundings. Milton uses a cinematic pull-back to highlight the first rays of light extending from Heaven's walls. The line deserves close attention: "But now at last the sacred influence of light appears." We cannot see enough to know exactly where we are-only that it is no longer black. But the light has more than the physical properties of dimness (as yet) and omnipresence. It has a moral quality-it is sacred. The rest of the sentence tries to ground us in more detail, but actually sends us back to the first part for syntactic verification. For as we read "and ... shoots far into the bosom of dim Night" we are fine; but the next phrase, "a glimmering dawn," turns "shoots" from an intransitive into a transitive verb. We look back for the subject and remind ourselves that it is not "light" but "influence." An abstract quality-an influence-is both sacred and active. We do not have, as at first we imag- ined, a simple picture of light springing from the heavenly walls out into space, but a more complex idea of a power or force pushing the light: we deal not with the elemental and inanimate but with a presence both reason- ing and sanctified. Likewise the phrase "bosom of dim Night" turns the simple physical world of Chaos into a living, anthropomorphic figure. We are not wander- ing like Aeneas through a shadowy but at least threel-dimensional world. Here, a fourth dimension exists, both investing physical phenomena with moral significance and taking an active part by behaving according to the dictates of the moral scenario. Thus, when the "influence" becomes</page><page sequence="6">198 The Journal of Narrative Technique "sacred," any opposing forces take on the opposite quality (so Night is "dim"). More important, the locus of the action leaves the natural world and enters the supernatural, not in the Olympian sense of classical epic, but in a Platonic sense where the supernatural is not a metaphor for the real, but rather the true exemplar of what the natural only partly displays. A similar set of antitheses is established as the passage continues. Nature begins and Chaos retires. This Nature is the shaped Creation, opposed to the unformed areas of Chaos. The capitalization and feminizing of Nature again make her a moral force with anthropomorphic qualities and not sim- ply the physical world that she presents to mortal eyes. In the case of Chaos, Milton uses a splendid Homeric simile. She retires "as from her outmost works a brok'n foe/With tumult less and with less hostile din." She, too, is anthropomorphic, invested with moral qualities ("brok'n") and de- scribed psychologically to provide another level of reality parallel to the physical situation, if that which is unformed can be physically described. Only after we have oscillated between these states-physical and moral/psychological--does the camera focus again on Satan. The extreme- ly long sentence continues, but we are at a fulcrum: the introductory "that" of line 1041 begins a clause of result, and this clause is a peculiarly Latinate use of English syntax. Satan in this physical picture is related thereby to the varying and different states of reality just described. And the process con- tinues. As Satan "wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light," Milton is busy with words and similes so charged with psychological detail that they force the action back up to that fourth-dimensional plane. Thus, while Satan "wafts, " the word betrays how insecure is his balance. The OED cites this passage to illustrate the definition "to sail about, off, to and fro, up and down"-that is, without a clear direction. (Note also the accompanying 1648 citation from Thomas Gage, a new survey of the West Indias: "we that day wafted about for a good wind. ") Satan floats both passively and defen- sively on a dubious medium (and "dubious" is a word with special import for him from Book 1:104). The wave is "calmer"-the comparative and in- decisive degree of the adjective. His passiveness is further supported by the metaphor in which the ship, a potentially active vehicle, rests at anchor. Satan thus moves from the physical situation of a bat-like creature bobbing on waves of light to the moral situation, of broader import for the whole narrative, of a watchful waiter. The vacillation (for "dubious" comes from dubare-to vacillate) is emphasized as the authorial voice tries out another image. Satan in emptier (once more, the comparative degree) air hovers with wings spread. Again he is in the midst of contrasts as the waste resembles (but is not) air. This scene is a transitional point in the passage, for what follows is a glit- tering description of heaven and earth, fully realized at the physical level. The amazing psychological parallel between Satan's plight and the depar- ture of Aeneas from Hades need hardly be mentioned: Aeneas is held in abeyance as he wanders with his father, surrounded by contrasts- fugiatque feratque-only to have the psychological situation relieved by a physical description totally different in mood. Likewise, after the descrip- tion, Satan will take action in a way parallel to Aeneas above ground. While</page><page sequence="7">Latin Narrative Syntax in Virgil and Milton 199 light is unable to show us anything in Chaos, its sacred influence reveals "Opal Tow'rs and Battlements adorn'd/Of living Sapphire ... a Golden Chain/This pendant world. . . ." Again moral qualities characterize the description. Satan hovers by means of weighing (i.e., measuring, balancing) his wings, but the Empyreal Heaven is vast, limitless, "undetermin'd square or round." Satan has just been compared to a ship with "Shrouds and Tackle torn" but Heaven is glowing, strong, and healthy. Most important, Satan is caught up now between light and dark, time and eternity, creation and chaos. He can have no sense of the physical "whereness" of his situa- tion because this No-Man's Land cannot have any. Yet Heaven, within his view, was "once his native Seat." Why no longer? Instead of a sense of place he has digression and vacillation: his own identity has been changed, along with his trading the brilliant stones and jewels for "emptier waste." We do not have a simple picture of a viewer gazing upon a scene. On that charged fourth-dimensional level (where all these disconnected images form a coherent pattern) we perceive evil, digressive homelessness contemplating good, stable integrity. The image of the created universe hanging on its golden chain is particularly felicitous in this case, for Satan (and we, look- ing through the "camera" over his shoulder) has not noticed it at first; as he lowers his gaze he becomes aware of it. He flies off in a fiery arc (like our visions of rocket trajectories approaching their targets) heading down through the Ptolemaic shells of that universe. But our gaze, as well as the camera's, continues to ascend, coming closer and closer to the source of light in a measured, controlled, yet breathtaking zoom to the throne of God as the third book begins its hymn to holy Light. So Virgil's narrative, it would seem, exploits the advantages that the more elaborate syntax of Latin lends him. Although Milton occasionally attempts to use English as an inflected language, he relies more heavily on the various shades of connotative meaning that two thousand years of Latin (and Latinate) literature have created. Likewise, he can marshal the resources of northern European languages unknown to Virgil. But both poets are allied in the psychological realism of their narratives. Milton has inherited from Virgil what he could never have found in Homer: the power of langauge to mean much more than the words themselves say. When Virgil writes that Aeneas must both fugiatque feratque, he is establishing a moral dilemma of vast significance, much more powerful than any dictionary meaning of the words could supply. The hero has spent the first half of the epic fleeing Troy-and the past. He has carried his father-and destiny. The position of these verbs in this crucial, halfway passage, their moral qualities for the Roman mind, their setting in a proph- ecy that will be dubious and vague for Aeneas after his ivory-gated exit-all of these properties lift the situation far above the physical locus. Similarly, the description of Satan descending to Earth-"and in a cursed hour he hies"-implies much more than the bare meaning of the words denotes. The "cursed hour" means that he is leaving Eternity and entering Time. The hour is cursed because of an event that has not yet taken place in the poem and only his hieing thither can curse it. It is an hour to be cursed by Man today, and Man (Adam) at that time; to be cursed by Satan then</page><page sequence="8">200 The Journal of Narrative Technique (because of his torment at seeing Eden) and Satan later (because that hour sets in action the machinery for his worst torment-the intervention of Christ into history-and his own final cursing). One might say that in Virgil this moral realm is a coordinate in action of the physical realm. It intensifies the physical action at crucial points, but functions on a one-to-one basis with the physical order. For Milton, however, the greatest part of the action lies in this higher realm. What one sees is only a partial, material disclosure of the greater truths. If Milton's physical settings are as vague and changeable as the opening of the passage from Virgil, it is because he is aware of the many vertical stages on which actions are occurring. Unlike Virgil's counterpointed bass and melodic lines, Miltonic music calls for chords of harmonic richness as each event yields unexpected and cosmic meaning.
