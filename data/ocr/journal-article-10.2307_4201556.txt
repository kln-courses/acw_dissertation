<plain_text><page sequence="1">POSSESSING THE LAND: THE QUMRAN SECT AND THE ESCHATOLOGICAL VICTORY WILLIAM JOHN LYONS University of Sheffield Introduction The release of large amounts of Qumran material in recent years has served to emphasise that the work of the first generation of Qumran scholars is now subject to revision, not because of any greater insight or knowledge, but simply because a text, previously hidden, has been revealed which either qualifies or negates their conclusions. In this arti- cle, it is my intention to look at two such related texts; the first is that of a blessing recovered from Cave 11, and originally published by A.S. van der Woude in 1968 ( lIQBer),2 the second a Cave 4 text containing some parallel material which is still "officially" unpublished (4Q285)2 but which is now available in numerous sources.3 I "Ein neuer Segensspruch aus Qumnran (I IQBer)," Bibel und Qumran: Beitrage zur Erforschung der Beziehungen zwischen Bibel und Qumranwissenschaft: Hans Bardtke zum 22.9.1966 (ed. S. Wagner, Berlin: Evangelische Haupt-Bibelgesellschaft, 1968) 253-8 and plate 1. According to van der Woude, I QBer consists of four fragments (253; cf. PAM 43.977). Of these two are too small to be of any use. The two remain- ing fragments are almost certainly of the same column, the bottom of which is visible. However, there is clearly a preceding column, and it seems possible that there may have been at least a following column. The line separation is approximately 8-9 mm;r, and the letters are approximately 4 mm high. (This close ratio of line to letter size gives the manuscript a more cramped appearance than most Qumran scrolls; for example, I 1QT.) On the basis of these distances, F. Garcia Martinez has identified a further 3 x 3 cm fragment on PAM 44.006 ("Texts from Qumran Cave 11," The Dead Sea Scrolls: Forty Years of Research [ed. D. Dimant and U. Rappaport Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1992] 24.) This small fragment contained two complete words on two lines; the first was I17 and the second was Mo. The first could indicate either a foreign nation or Israel. The second could be based on one of three possible verb roots: ;i0 "to take prisoner," M1z "to return," DV' "to dwell." Of these roots the first seem the most likely. 2 4Q285 consists of approximately 18 fragments (found on PAM 43.325), and the blessing section can be found on 4 (or possibly 5) of these. Though it is not possible to say how large the manuscript was in its entirety due to the damage it has sustained, it seems likely to have consisted of several columns. It is of course possible that the blessing is from a separate manuscript, but the wording of the blessing leads me to ? E.J. Brill, Leiden, 1996 Dead Sea Discoveries 3, 2</page><page sequence="2">POSSESSING THE LAND 131 The recent availability of the 4Q text has rendered a revision of van der Woude's work necessary, and it is part of my aim here to under- take such a revision in the form of a new translation of these texts, followed by a commentary. This translation will also function as a corrective to those who have produced more recent translations of these texts; namely, M.O. Wise,4 F. Garcia Martinez,5 B. Nitzan,6 and also the Hebrew text suggested by M.G. Abegg.7 I also wish to argue that their work has served to confuse the question of the precise Sitz im Leben of the blessing. My contention is that the text is a piece of eschatological liturgy contained-at least in the case of 4Q285- within a thoroughly sectarian Qumran text, the purpose of which was to be the new blessing spoken over the Congregation of Israel within the land of Israel following their final eschatological victory, the contents of which were already being fulfilled by the time it was to be read. A Review of Publications Responsibility for some of the material retrieved from Cave 11 was accepted by the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Weten- schappen, and two Dutch scholars, J.P.M. van der Ploeg and A.S. van der Woude, were appointed as editors.8 The text of lIQBer was first believe that a setting like that of 4Q285 is quite plausible. Further, the scripts do match closely, and no one has, to my knowledge, questioned the connection between the frag- ments. I R.H. Eisenman and J.M.

Van der Woude described the text as having a literary form wavering between an actual blessing and a prayer request, probably to be read by a priest or high priest. The individual blessings contained in the text all relate to the end-times and so are indicative in mood, the blessings ultimately being assured by God. However, the text has no explicit setting and van der Woude could not say when the blessing was used; in fact, he doubted that it ever was. Despite being unable to define its exact Sitz im Leben, it is clear from his translation that van der Woude thought of 1 lQBer as a blessing to be spoken at a time when the eschatological blessings were still as yet unfulfilled. The story of the cave 4 text is somewhat more convoluted. 4Q285 was originally assigned to J.T. Milik for publication.9 This manuscript was known as 4QBerakhot Milhamah (BM) in the preliminary con- cordance,'0 but was redesignated Serekh ha-Milhamah by Milik" who referred to the text in his 1972 essay, "Milk;-sedeq et Milkl-re?a dans les anciens 6crits juifs et chretiens,"'2 placing it within the framework of the eschatological battle. There he also noted that some of the frag- ments were paralleled in the cave 11 text, 1 lQBer,'3 which had already been published in 1968. However, the text itself was not published at that time, eventually being reassigned to J.J. Collins of the Divinity School at the University of Chicago.'4 However, in November 1991 the text became available to scholars outside the editing team for the first time, fragments appearing amongst the photographs contained in the Facsimile Edition of R.H. Eisenman and J.M. Robinson.'5 Furthermore, Eisenman and M.O. Wise announced 9 Cf. G. Vermes, "The Oxford Forum for Qumran Research Seminar on the Rule Of War from Cave 4 (4Q285)," JJS 43 (1992) 86. 10 Abegg notes that Milik's early transcription of 4Q285, as reconstructed from the preliminary concordance, included the rare word ,7'lD undoubtedly drawn from line 11 of 1 IQBer, showing that he had already connected the two scrolls at this stage ("Messianic Hope," 84). When discussing 1 lQBer van der Woude's numbering system will be used and signified with bold numbers. Since the first translation of the 4Q text- that of Wise-does not relate the fragments correctly, the numbering system of Abegg will be used and signified with italicized numbers.

Their translation is not recog- nisable as a blessing, and contains a number of dubious reconstructions. In 1992 Spanish translations of both texts were published by F. Garcia Martinez.'8 Unlike that of Wise, his translation of the 4Q text relates the fragments correctly, and he has clearly recognised a con- nection between the two texts. However, Garcia Martinez' attitude to the two texts is confusing. Though his reconstruction of 4Q285 is reliant on the lIQ text, his translation of llQBer follows van der Woude's 1968 translation, reproducing most of his textual reconstruc- tions despite the new 4Q285 evidence. Yet he does occasionally trans- late portions of the I IQ text differently from van der Woude, and these changes are reflected in his translation of the 4Q text. Thus his trans- lations appear inconsistent. Since Garcia Martinez' translation is not accompanied by comment, we can only infer his understanding of the texts. It seems likely that, despite the new material of 4Q285, his inter- pretation follows that of van der Woude. B. Nitzan has recently published an article on these two texts in which she "attempts to clarify the connection between the eschatolog- ical benedictions over Israel and some other subjects which are treated in Serek ha-milhamah on the one hand, and their place and function 16 New York Times, 8 November 1991, sec.

Garcia Martinez, "Cave 11 ," 18.</page><page sequence="5">134 WILLIAM JOHN LYONS within the situation dealt with in the composition on the other hand."'9 According to Nitzan, the texts contain a ceremonial blessing which was probably intended to be spoken by a priest. Because of the presence of angels within the community, she suggests that those addressed are an ideal transgression-free community which must therefore be placed at the end of the eschatological war. In relating the blessing to other frag- ments of 4Q285, she sees the writer of the 4Q text as being concerned with those who sin by hoarding plunder during the burial of the enemy dead and with their eventual repentence and incorporation into the eschatological congregation of Israel, the community envisaged in the blessing. However, her translation of the blessing text itself continues to follow van der Woude in seeing the blessings as being unfulfilled at the intended time of the text's recitation. Although M.G. Abegg has not actually produced a translation of the text, his recent article, "Messianic Hope and 4Q285," does propose a particular setting for the blessing. He notes that the War Scroll con- tains a series of addresses by the priests to the troops, each made before a battle begins, and suggests that the text may be an address read by a priest before the final and victorious battle in the eschato- logical war. This proposal is primarily based on the occurrence of the word =11pnl in 4Q285 line 11, which Abegg translates "And when you draw near." This he connects with Deut. 20:2 ("And when you draw near [D.mp:I to battle, the Priest shall come and speak with the people"), a passage which is also quoted in column ten of the War Scroll. In Abegg's setting the blessing is still as yet unfulfilled, and the reconstructions which he suggests reflect this belief; holy angels will stand in the congregation. The 4Q text, Abegg believes, is completed by the death of the king of the Kittim recorded in fragment 5. Two Manuscripts-One Document That there is a relationship of some kind between these two manu- scripts has been accepted by all who have studied them together. Since van der Woude did not know of the existence of 4Q285 when he pub- lished the 11 Q text, the first to comnment upon the relationship was J.T. Milik in 1972. However, as noted, he stated only that some of the 4Q '9 "Benedictions," 78; she comments further on these texts in her book, Qumran Prayer, 139-43, 168-9.</page><page sequence="6">POSSESSING THE LAND 135 text was paralleled in the now published I lQBer. Garcia Martinez indicates a relationship between the two texts in the title to the 4Q translation (174) and the book's index (504, 517). But it is difficult to discern exactly how he perceives that relationship. Although he has used the 11Q text to reconstruct 4Q285, we are left to assume that he does not consider them to be the same text because of his treatment of 1 lQBer. It was G. Vermes who finally proposed the view taken in this study, when he wrote that the "4Q and I IQ texts seem to be almost identical."20 A comparison of van der Woude's transcribed text of I lQBer and Wise's transcription of 4Q285 reveals differences between them. However, most of these are the result of faulty transcription, and can be corrected by referring to the original photographs. First, one letter in 4Q285, ', is simply misread as a 1; M&amp;[ instead of 10I in line 2. Second, the : in C'D0 in line 4 of the 4Q text is badly damaged, and the existence of a I preceding must be regarded as highly dubious; certainly Garcia Martinez, Nitzan, and Abegg do not include it.2' Third, the edge of the 4Q285 fragment has removed part of the v at the beginning of line 6, leaving what Wise has taken to be a D. Finally, since Wise does not relate the blessing fragments together correctly, his understanding of how the text should be reconstructed is based only on his seeing the text in the light of the other fragments of 4Q285. Thus the word ilrnRIMM "in its produce" is reconstructed as rr]nn "with understand- ing" in line 8. It has also been proposed by those who laid out the tex- tual fragments in PAM 43.325 that the 4Q text should read ~teWr "': (Milik) or 'nnv 'Iz7 (Garcia Martinez, Abegg) in line 0. However, there is no close fit between these fragments and therefore no com- pelling reason as to why this suggestion should be accepted rather than a reconstruction based upon the 11Q text. In fact, there is only one clear difference between these two scroll fragments.22 This concerns the layout of the blessing in 1 lQBer. Following 20 Rule of War," 89, n. 13. 21 Textos, 174, ET 123; "Benedictions," 80; "Messianic Hope," 84. 1 It is possible that the 4Q text uses a ' to prefix the word "k in line 7 rather than the I found in line 10 of llQBer, although a hole in the fragment may be responsible for this feature. This construction was fairly common at Qumran, occurring some forty times with the meaning "without, so that not." Cf. E. Qimron, The Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls (HSS 29; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1986) 77. B. Kittel notes that the construction TrN' "expresses with admirable brevity the complete impossibility of something" (The Hymns of Qumran: Translation and Commentary [SBLDS 50;</page><page sequence="7">136 WILLM JOHN LYONS "his holy angels" in line 5, a new paragraph begins. Although this part of the text is missing from 4Q285, it is clear from the position of mnt in line 3 that the same section does not begin a new paragraph in the 4Q text. It is unclear what meaning can be attached to this, but it may indicate the existence of two originally separate elements, perhaps mak- ing 11 QBer the original, and therefore older, text.23 However, this difference aside, it can be seen that the extant portions of the two texts are virtually identical, suggesting either reliance upon a common original or the reliance of one upon the other. Though we cannot be certain which of these is the case, it can be concluded that the two blessings are so similar that they can plausibly be used to reconstruct a single text. It is my intention to look at the meaning of this reconstructed text in light of the extant 4Q285 fragments. Because the I IQ text has no explicit setting, the possible range of settings of lIQBer will be considered following our look at 4Q285. Chico: Scholars Press, 1981] 41). However, the linking function of the phrase is differ- ent from that of the construction JI'W, perhaps implying a causal relationship between two items. 23 The methods available for dating Qumran scrolls fall into four categories; archae- ological, palaeographical, radio-carbon dating, and internal evidence. The latter is not applicable to I IQBer, and in the case of 4Q285 can only suggest a similar style of thought with other Qumran documents relating to an eschatological war (for example, IQM); there is no explicit outside reference poinL The script of IlQBer is of the type classified by F.M. Cross as a medial Fonnal Herodian script ("The Development of the Jewish Scripts," The Bible and the Ancient Near East [ed. G.E. Wright; Garden City: Doubleday, 19611 139, 173). It is "practically identical" with the script of IIQT (cf. Garcia Martinez, "Cave 11," 24); a script dated by Y. Yadin to the end of the first cen- tury BCE and the beginning of the first century CE (The Temple Scroll [3 vols. plus supplement; ET, Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society, 1983] 1.18). J. Maier further refines this type, designating the 1 IQT script as Middle Herodian Ornamental script (The Temple Scroll-An Introduction, Translation and Commentary [ET R.T. White; JSOTSup 34; Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1985] 1). B. Nitzan, however, dates the script of 1 lQBer somewhat earlier, to the middle of the first century BCE. The 4Q285 script is also a Middle Herodian Formal script, but Nitzan dates this text slightly later than the 1 Q text, at around 50-20 BCE. Although this may seem to confirm a view of the I IQ text as the older of the two, paleographic evidence is incapable of such precision. Therefore, options for dating both scrolls range from 50 BCE to 25 CE, though of course they may both be copies of an earlier document. Also, because of the possibil- ity, pointed out by P.R. Davies (Behind the Essenes: History and Ideology in the Dead Sea Scrolls [BJS; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1987] 136-7 n. 19), of the later use of an older script by a new scribe, it remains possible that the final date of writing could approach the 68 CE suggested by archaeological study. Unfortunately, neither of the two scrolls being studied here has been dated by the radio-carbon method and, given their fragmentary nature, it seems unlikely they will be in the foreseeable future.</page><page sequence="8">POSSESSING THE LAND 137 The Combined 4QI11Q Text24 h*oR) rni, tR t : s ] 0 [ ^ t5'tD t~~~~R 0D:b [ n:lm:n tni n n ]4P_b5t~~[ 1mp D p1:11] 2 [flfln 0' 1.s me 11l &amp;s tr [r ~p ':'7D * 3 [=-,mr nR vx Xe_7 =M -D 25 R M Q70 3 n=Mn n, ir lnn 71:,, E1j-1 M[rT1 ["Wk n D ] 4 [ t 'rw :nD mm =15 n:[rn ]flmrn :'nC mmn ~ ,mmn] 6 11BW 1l*1 Rl5l_[rtMX1 i r'sl ' [nrm 1 7 -IInn D-WMl 1 3]10tnj ] , 12mjs1lU rrn' 1 8 lump :Dtnt Om Lta 5A w [4n[micn I-,Ml rflRT I n 9 [Ml o rnn p 1mo 1m 1 I'Thz?1 ip:.

Eisenman and Robinson, Facsimile Edition, plate 1687). However, Garcia Martinez adds the phrase "Y tomaran la palabra [ y diran...] (And they will take the word [and they will say)"; this translation cannot be sustained from the Hebrew text as it stands and does not appear in his recent English translation. 2) See lQM 15:7, 16:13; also plural forms lQS 2:5; IQM 13:2; 14:4; 18:6. 3) Van der Woude should be followed here, and MRlt read in line with the narrative comment and the second person plural address used in the text. 4) See Isa. 45:17; 1QH 1:32, 7:31, 11:26,13:13, 17:28; IQSb 3:21. There is no textual evidence for Abegg's suggestion of nD[ nID W [D. 5) Van der Woude suggests 1n[74, but it is my opinion that this is the middle line of a doxology containing "God,....?...., and his holy angels"; possibly then a plural entity such as the archangels (cf. IQM 9:15- 16; see the occurrence of Michael in frag 10 of 4Q285). 6) Num. 6:24-25. Abegg suggests here 711, presumable with vav con- secutive. The 11Q text reads, 7:1'. Since the 1 Q text begins a new paragraph here, but the 4Q text does not, Abegg may be correct to reconstruct the text in this way. The translation is unaffected either way, but it seems more likely to me that we have here a simple imperfect tense following the participles in the doxology, and that the 1 1Q text should be followed. 7) Deut. 28:12. The text differs from MT concerning the whereabouts of the bountiful treasury. MT reads, "his good treasury, the heav- ens" and is followed by the Septuagint, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Peshitta, the Vulgate, Targum Onqelos, and the Babylonian Talmud (b. Ta'an. 9a). Unfortunately, this portion of Deuteronomy has not been found among the texts from Qumran. 8) Van der Woude made no comment on the appearance of a , fol- lowing a final form :. Other examples are now known (see 1 QT</page><page sequence="10">POSSESSING THE LAND 139 cols. 41:13 ='ZS and 56:13 'ft rMT ; see Yadin, Temple Scroll, 123). This insertion does not affect the meaning of the text. 9) Jer. 5:24; cf. Deut. 11:14. Should be understood as if punctu- ated rlm--pt nl Mv--omm, meaning that Im is equivalent to the former and latter rains (contra Garcia Martinez' mm = "escar- cha" (frost), Textos, 174, 451; also rendered as "frost" in his recent English translation, 123-24). 10) According to Qimron, the form MrLVin is actually a hithpael form, in which the rn has been assimilated to the -r (Hebrew, 55). 11) Exod. 23:25. Qimron notes the inclusion of a I instead of the Massoretic rendering of rlftn and concludes that this was due to the difference between DSS Hebrew and the Tiberian tradition of the Massoretic text (Hebrew, 39). There is no difference in meaning. 12) It is possible to read the verb as a kal form, thus "he will not see blight and mildew in its produce"; he as (1) a Congregation mem- ber or (2) God himself. But these two nouns are subjects of a sin- gular verb in 1 Kgs. 8:37. The verb then is more probably a niphal. 13) The 4Q text enables us to reject the reconstruction based on Lev. 26:22 suggested by van der Woude ("Segensspruch," 2534), and used in Garcia Martinez' version of 1 lQBer only (Textos, 452; ET 124). Nitzan, however, deals rather inconsistently with the 4Q evi- dence, following van der Woude here but adopting the 4Q text reading in line 13 ("Benedictions," 80). On the basis of both texts a secure reading is =MM *'7[ ]D L0 1y'[... The edge of a D in the lIQ text means that bI0= seems secure, as is 'tR. Three pos- sibilities are to be considered: (1) Use of t1D= and 9l in Isa. 8:14. Unlikely because remains of a letter encroaches upon 3. lfn in fragment 4 shows that this does not occur with the final 9 in this script. (2) following 1QH 16:15, Abegg, ("Messianic Hope," 84), and Nitzan (for 4Q text only, "Benedictions," 80) read text as bIn l's (3) note parallel b&gt;DD and MN in 1QH 10:17-8. This suggestion is probably better than (1) and (2), and so will be followed here. Garcia Martinez has apparently followed this reading in his trans- lation of 4Q285., but his reconstruction of the Hebrew text is unclear.</page><page sequence="11">140 WILLIAM JOHN LYONS 14) Van der Woude used Lev. 26:6 to reconstruct the missing 1lQ text. However, the 4Q285 fragment has necessitated the replace- ment of his reconstruction (cf. Vermes, "Rule of War," 89 n. 13 and also Nitzan, "Benedictions," 80). 15) Van der Woude suggests w=x'l, hithpael participle of =r "to stand," based upon the idea of angels living in the community (cf. 1QH 10:11; "Segensspruch," 253, 255), and this is followed by Nitzan ("Benedictions," 80) and here. Garcia Martinez renders his trans- lations of 4Q285 and lIQBer differently. Although his version of the former may follow van der Woude's (Textos, 175; ET 124), for some reason he renders the 11Q text differently, as "are to be found" (Textos, 452; ET 124), despite the lack of any further 4Q information. While it is true that the verb inserted may vary as to its exact meaning, it is surely inconsistent to supply two different verbs when no concrete evidence exists for either. Wacholder and Abegg suggest M:rr "will stand," a reading which does not fit the Sitz im Leben that I am suggesting for these texts, reflecting their view of the blessing as one that would be recited before its actual fulfilment (Preliminary Edition, 223; see also Abegg, "Messianic Hope," 84). 16) Though the blessing may continue, a natural conclusion has been reached. As no cursing section is required, I regard these words as the conclusion to at least this section of the blessing. 17) This section of text appears only in 4Q285 and is from the next line of the manuscript. There is insufficient material to identify these words as part of the blessing text, though the second person, masculine plural possessive suffix makes it likely that the speech is continuing. The Setting of the 4Q285 Blessing In a 1992 article, Geza Vermes noted that an "atmosphere of escha- tological victory" permeates the 4Q285 text,25 and it is this "atmos- phere" which forms the starting point for my discussion of the blessing in its 4Q setting. We now have the other fragments of the 4Q text which, though badly damaged, do allow us to suggest a more specific setting for the blessing section of the text. Fragment 4 contains three I "Rule of War," 89.</page><page sequence="12">POSSESSING THE LAND 141 allusions to the Prince of the Congregation, mentioning an advance to the sea and a return to dry land, the smiting of wickedness, and the bringing of a man before the Prince. Vermes connects this man with the object of the verb rrrra in line 4 of fragment 5, reading "and he, the Prince of the Congregation, will kill him" (contra Eisenman and Wise). He suggests that the most likely "him" is the King of the Kittim, citing as support W. Horbury's suggestion, based on the Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch, chapter 40, that the ruler of the last world empire would be brought to Jerusalem to be judged and executed by the Messiah.26 This understanding of the text is one that I basically share, and leaves us to consider the place of the blessing in a text which contains an account of the final victory over the Kittim. Of course, the principal sectarian text found at Qumran concerning the eschatological war is IQM, the War Scroll. This document contains an account of the final battle, giving details of the equipment, men, tactics, and liturgy to be used. However, the text is clearly composite in nature, including two conflicting views of the war. One sees the war as a forty-year campaign or series of campaigns between Israel and the nations (cols. I-IX), and the other sees the war as consisting of seven battles in a single day before the Kittim are defeated (cols. XV-XIX).27 According to P.R. Davies, these two battle plans were placed together with an introduction which harmonised them, resulting in a forty-year war, which involved the defeat of the Kittim in Israel after six years, and then the gradual defeat of the nations over the remaining period.28 In this version of the war the land would be taken and possessed after six years, the nations finally being defeated after the full forty years. However these plans were understood by the sect, it is clear that their victorious possession of the land of Israel was of paramount importance, and it is this possession which forns the setting for our text. According to Abegg, the blessing was to be read before the final battle took place, and thus before the land was possessed. This is problematic for two reasons. Firstly, because the word O "And when you draw near," on which he places so much emphasis, can also be translated, "And in your midst," a preferable reading which fits easily into this text and which severs his proposed link between the 26 "Rule of War," 89-90. 27 J.P.M. van der Ploeg, Le Rouleau de la Guerre (Leiden: E.J.

The second reason is that he does not do jus- tice to the verbal tenses of the text, a point I shall return to shortly. Nitzan's view of the blessing being delivered following the final bat- tle and the eschatological victory is, in my view, essentially correctL Unfortunately, her translation still reflects a view of the blessing as being as yet unfulfilled, and this serves to confuse the question of the precise Sitz im Leben of the blessing. It is my belief, however, that the 4Q/1 IQ blessing is best understood as a piece of eschatological liturgy intended to be recited over the sect-and perhaps those who had joined them29-following their conquest of the land (in contrast to Abegg), the contents of which were already being fulfilled (in contrast to Nitzan); an idea perhaps based on the Deuteronomic blessings read over Mosaic Israel by Joshua at Mt Ebal and Mt. Gerizim (Josh. 8:30-35; cf. Deut. 27: 15-28:68).3I Such an understanding of the setting of the text is further sup- ported by the occurrence of the perfect verb form fnrfl in line 12 of the 1lQBer text. Unfortunately, the significance of this verb form has been obscured by previous translations of these texts. Despite being a perfect tense, van der Woude, Nitzan, and presumably Abegg, trans- late this verb as having a future sense, "may wild animals be banished from the land."'" Because of Hebrew's system of aspects, one could argue that the complete extent of the ceasing that will occur allows one to use a perfect verb to describe it (a so-called "prophetic perfect"). 29 Cf. IQSa 1:1-5; see L.H. Schiffman, The Eschatological Community of the Dead Sea Scrolls: A Study of the Rule of the Congregation (SBLMS 38; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1989) 11-12, 68. 30 Liturgy was much used at Qumran; the types of liturgies that have survived include prayers (1Q34), hymns of praise (IQM 14), and blessings (IQS 2:2-4). Some of these liturgies were clearly for use in the community's pre-eschatological 'ritual life (1QS 2:24). However, some were written for, or at least incorporated into, eschatolog- ical texts; examples of which are the hymns of praise included among the liturgy for use in the eschatological war found in IQM 10-14. The clearest parallel to the 4Q/1 IQ blessing is that of the Rule of Benedictions (lQSb). There a series of blessings are out- lined, each one to be spoken over a particular group at an eschatological ceremony. Schiffman has suggested that these blessings-though without any explicit setting- were to be read out at a mustering ceremony to be held at the end of days (IQSa 1:22- 25; Eschatological Community, 75-6). This mustering would replace the pre-eschaton ritual of the sect recorded in The Rule of the Community (lQS 2), and the blessings and curses used there would be replaced with just a blessing because, as a result of the eschaton, no more curses were needed. This use of blessing in the eschaton indicates the sect's view of their liturgy as both pre-figuring and being part of the eschatological life. 31 Cf. Nitzan, "Benedictions," 80.</page><page sequence="14">POSSESSING THE LAND 143 Yet this line of the blessing is probably drawn from two particular biblical passages, Lev. 26:6 and Ezek. 34:25, both of which use per- fect hiphil verbs with vav consecutives in order to render God's future action which will cause the final destruction of the evil beasts. Garcia Martinez has seen this difficulty, and attempted to deal with it in a completely different fashion; he removes the beasts altogether! Thus he translates "Y el mal desaparecera de la tierra," (in English translation, "and evil will vanish from the land," 124) in his translations of both 4Q285 and llQBer. An easier way to deal with the text is simply to accept the verb as indicating a completed action. Since this simple perfect differs from the form in both the Leviticus and Ezekiel passages where a future cessa- tion is envisaged, we should accept that the text is actually saying, "and evil beasts have ceased from the land." Our task then is to try to understand the circumstances in which such a rendering makes sense, rather than to force a different interpretation. Such circumstances can be envisaged and, I believe, fit very well into the overall setting of 4Q285. The land has been conquered, the future crops will be pros- perous, and the people will eat and be satisfied. Of the blight and mildew it can be said that they will not appear, simply because the crops in which they would have normally appeared have not yet been grown. However, the beasts must cease from the land as it is pos- sessed; there can be no future dimension. By the expected time of the recital of the blessing they would have been destroyed and no longer exist in the land; the eschatological blessings were already being fulfilled. The Blessing on the Congregation in the Land The blessing portion of 4Q285 begins with the narrative comment, "and he will bless them in [the name of the God of I]srael, de- clar[ing.. . ." Van der Woude has suggested that the speaker of the blessing could be a priest or even a high priest.32 Nitzan and Abegg also presume that a priest was the speaker.33 However, the blessings in 32 In support of this position it can be said that there seems to be little doubt that priests were part of the Qumran community (cf. IQS 2:1). In an eschatological setting the War Scroll mentions the existence of a high priest (IQM 2:1, 15:4), and a priest especially ordained for the time of vengeance, who recites a liturgy (15:6). 33 Nitzan, "Benedictions," 79; Qumran Prayer, 142, 169; Abegg, "Messianic Hope," 84-5.</page><page sequence="15">144 WILLIAM JOHN LYONS the Rule of Benedictions (lQSb) were almost certainly to be spoken over various members or groups of the community at an eschatologi- cal ceremony by the b', and these included the high priest (4:22-8) and the Zadokite priests (3:22-8). The identity of the b'=D in the pre- eschatological community is disputed-suggestions ranging from a priest-4 or a Levite35 to John J. Collins's concept of the b' as a "proleptic actualisation" of one of the two messiahs expected by the commu- nity3-and the relationship between pre- and post-eschaton figures is also unclear. Despite this lack of clarity, it does seem that the escha- tological t'=n must also be a candidate for the eschatological "he" pronouncing the blessing of 4Q285. The recipients of the blessing are designated consistently by the second person, masculine plural, "you" or "your." Such a group could consist of either men only or of both men and women. However, given the occurrence of the word "miscarriage" in line 10-a word related to women in its only occurrence in the Hebrew Bible (Exod. 23:26)-it seems probable that it includes both men and women (see also lQSa 1:6-1 1).3 The two words, =DIR and MD"P, give us clues as to who the group is. The first is that they possess an rl, here without doubt a reference to the land of Israel.38 The second clue is that they are a congregation, an rM. The most frequent use of this designation in the Hebrew Bible (115 times) is for the people of Israel, especially Mosaic P.R. Davies, Qumran (Cambridge: Lutterworth Press, 1982) 91. 3 G. Vermes, The Dead Sea Scrolls in English (2nd Edition; Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1975) 21-25; this section was dropped from later editions. 36 "Patterns of Eschatology at Qumran," Traditions in Transformation: Turning Points in Biblical Faith (ed. B. Halpern and J.D. Levenson; Winona Lake, IN: Eisen- brauns, 1981) 358. 37 This is problematic for the view, proposed by L.H. Schiffman, that the women and children were not allowed to mix with the angels of God in the council of the Congregation in lQSa (cf. IQM 7:3-6; Eschatological Community, 51) since, according to 4Q285, the angels were in the Congregation. However, it is possible that the angels were only in part of the Congregation; namely, the male part. -1 There are three strands of evidence which support this view. First, that the bless- ings to be later articulated concerning the land are nearly all drawn from references in the Hebrew Bible to the blessings given to the land of Israel points towards the land being geographical Israel. Secondly, the text probably contains a blessing for the group in the name of the God of Israel (see lines 1 and 2), a blessing in the name of l"7D 'M-also Israel's God (lines 4 and 6), and they are the possession of this God (see line 14). Finally, the victorious eschatological setting given by the 4Q fragments (cf. Vermes, "Rule of War," 89) also suggests that the land that is the possession of the group is that of Israel. The exact area is not mentioned but may have been drawn from either specific descriptions (for example, Ezek. 47:15-20) or from historio-graphi- cal accounts (of the empires of David and Solomon perhaps).</page><page sequence="16">POSSESSING THE LAND 145 Israel (for example, Exod. 12:3, 6, 19, 47; Lev. 4:13; Num. 32:4; Josh. 22:18, 20). According to H. Stegemann, the rMr as "all Israel" was a term no longer applicable in late Second Temple Judaism.39 By then it had come to mean local communities or already existing groups. How- ever, the term did retain its specialised sense of "all Israel" within the Qumran community's eschatological writings (see 1QSa), being the des- ignation of the eschatological Israel gathered in the land following vic- tory in the eschatological war, and it is this sense that is found here; the Congregation being blessed is the eschatological Israel in possession of the land of Israel. The oral blessing begins with the speaker reprising the narrative comment of "and he shall bless them in [the name of the God of Ilsrael" in direct speech but with the name of God changed to that of jrsP b "God Most High," and a further clause, now lost, added. At the mention of the name of 11'0 "tt the blessing turns from a direct address to the Congregation to an address to their God. Van der Woude renders the term here as "gepriesen" (praise), and this usage is undoubtedly correct; humans cannot give to God the blessings of bounty that come from the deity's blessing of humanity, but only wor- ship and praise.40 The use of a Jlfl formula in this way indicates an optative call for God to be praised. Such praises were also often in the third person, as here. Though these formulaic praises were sometimes spontaneous in nature, the modifying formula here indicates the prob- able use of a doxology,4' introduced here at the mention of the divine name. Firstly, God is praised, then an unknown plural entity is praised, and finally God's angels are praised. The middle entity is probably to be understood as between God and the angels in terms of the sect's estimation of their rank, one possibility being that the group consists of archangels; four of whom are named in the War Scroll (Michael, Gabriel, Sariel, and Raphael; cf. 9:14-16), and one of whom, Michael, probably appears in fragment 10 of 4Q285. The speaker now returns to the Congregation. The blessing con- tinues with two short jussive sentences, dependent upon the Priestly Blessing of Num. 6:24-6, and underlined here.

The Priestly Blessing consists of three parallel lines, the opening unit of each couplet being a general statement of blessing, and the lat- ter a concrete request for blessing. It is two of the general opening units that are included here, the first being an all inclusive petition, and the second a petition for God's favour in the form of the light of his face. The concrete part of the blessing is supplied from elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible. This takes the form of a linear description of the agricultural blessings of the land from source to produce, followed by the removal of certain negative elements. The description begins with the source of blessing, God's opening of the heavens, and the phrase used is a rendering of Deut. 28:12. By replacing the concrete expres- sions of the Priestly Blessing with an expression of blessing found only in Deuteronomy 28, the text ensures that the sect members would have immediately connected the Deuteronomic blessings for Mosaic Israel with those being given to the Congregation of Israel.42 This connection adds three elements to the 4Q285 blessing. First, it introduces the covenant relationship between God and Israel. Second, the Deuteronomic setting of those possessing the land of Israel being blessed after their conquest would have been seen as having foreshadowed the triumphant entry of the restored Congregation into the land and their own reception of blessing. Thirdly, the purpose of the Deuteronomic blessings was to show to the nations that Israel belonged to God (Deut. 28:10, see line 14; cf. Isa. 61:9).43 This inclusion of umnque material becomes the most pervasive motif of the blessing. The text turns from the source of the blessing to the forrn of bless- ing. The first term, inn ',W3, includes all of the types of rain that follow and signifies not rains that have been blessed but rather rains that bring blessing." This rare word pair appears only in Ezek. 34:26, This incorporation of important sections of the Hebrew Bible is also found in other variants of the Priestly Blessing at Qumran; see G.J. Brooke, Exegesis at Qumran (JSOTsup 29; Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1985) 295-301. 43 It is interesting to note the lack of curses in the text, despite the fact that these are found in the Deuteronomic (and the Levitical) code. Although the text is short and one may argue that the curses are simply lost, it seems more likely that, as Schiffman argues in the case of IQSb (Eschatological Community, 75-6), the curses are no longer needed after the repossession of the land; in the 4Q285 setting the wicked would have been defeated permanently and the Congregation would live in blessing for ever. 4 Following Mitchell, Meaning, 53.</page><page sequence="18">POSSESSING THE LAND 147 a passage which is concerned with the restoration of Israel to the land, and gives what W. Eichrodt described as a "highly nationalistic description of a peaceful and fertile homeland."'45 The inclusion of the Ezekiel blessings in the 4Q/1lQ blessing connects the blessings in the prophetic corpus with the Qumran text, alongside the covenant bless- ings of Deuteronomy (and later Leviticus). However, it may be that the Ezekiel passage was also significant because this restoration takes place in the context of a new covenant between Israel and God (Ezek. 34:23-31).46 The types of "showers" that will come follow. The first, tM, was the night dew which was found in the morning but was gone in the daytime (Exod. 16:13-14), and the absence of which could cause considerable plight (Hag. 1:10; Zech. 8:12; see also 2 Sam. 1:21; 1 Kgs. 17:1). The rain, IMn, follows with the former and latter rains also included in the formula, an indication of the importance of the seasonal rainfall for the restored Israel.47 The sending of the rains from heaven assured, the blessing turns to the produce of the land. The threefold produce of corn, wine, and oil was the major agricultural crop of Israel, and their abundance was con- sidered a sign of blessing (Joel 2:18-27). The emphasis here implies the fulfilment of several blessing passages which mention an abun- dance of produce in the land (Deut. 28:11; Ezek. 34:27; 36:29, 30). The quality of the "fruits" is also described; as well as an abundance of produce there is also to be excellence. The use of indicative imper- fect verbs here signifies the future aspect of the blessing; the people have now taken the land and it will be sufficiently fruitful for them when they begin to farm it that they will be satisfied, a motif also mentioned in several biblical blessing passages (Deut. 6:11; 11:15; Ezek. 34:27). A change of emphasis takes place within the blessing. A concem with the provision of plentiful amounts of rain and produce is replaced by the need for the removal of certain elements which would interfere I Ezekiel (0T; ET London: SCM Press, 1970) 481. 16 Another Qumran scroll which may link the idea of covenant and this passage is the liturgical prayer, IQ34/34bis, which records the renewal of the covenant and men- tions a shepherd figure; see D. Barthelemy and J.T. Milik, Discoveries in the Judean Desert 1, Qumran Cave I (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1955) 152-55. 4 The rainy season lasted from late October to March/April and was particularly heavy at the beginning and end. These periods were the early rains-which lasted from October to the end of November and prepared the ground for ploughing-and the lat- ter rains-which lasted from March to April and helped mature the crops.</page><page sequence="19">148 WILLIAM JOHN LYONS with the Congregation's new life. These undesirable elements are included as a series of four pairs and, as with the unique phrases included above, each pair serves to call to mind certain biblical sec- tions of blessing. Each is negated; these things are no longer part of the life of the restored Congregation of Israel. The first pair are taken from the Book of the Covenant, the first word f "miscarriage" appearing only there in the Hebrew Bible (Exod. 23:26). The second word rn~ appears in v. 25 and is ren- dered as "sickness" or "illness." Their removal forms part of the bless- ings that relate to the settlement of the land following its conquest by Mosaic Israel. Clearly, the emphasis in this pairing is that the members of the Congregation will live long healthy lives and have many progeny. Blight and mildew are found together in numerous biblical passages, (Deut. 28:22; 1 Kgs. 8:37//2 Chron. 6:28; Amos 4:9; Hag. 2:17). The former was a very destructive plant disease and the latter referred to a range of plant diseases caused by various parasitic fungi. These two agricultural diseases would no longer appear in the land; as the pro- duce of the blessed land grows, it would be untouched and excellent.48 The next two negative elements to be removed once again come from within the Congregation itself. Biblically, a 'IonD caused the peo- ple of Israel to falter, and was usually either a problem of some kind caused by God (Jer. 6:21; Ezek. 3:20) or a problem that he needed or wished to remove (Isa. 57:14). The term here translated "scourge," DM, could be used of either markings on the body caused by physical wounding or the bodily markings caused by some kind of disfiguring disease. The latter was often seen as sent by God, and is probably cor- rect here.49 I' It is also noteworthy that every mention of this pairing in the Bible refers to them as a curse sent by God upon the land. It is also the case that the next two pairs, and to lesser extent the first pair, were also sometimes sent by God as a curse in the event of the misbehaviour of his people. Thus, the effect of including here two diseases usu- ally associated with God's curse is to re-emphasise the belief that God was with the Congregation, and that his cursing, as previously experienced by Israel, would cease forever in the eschaton. '9 The question of "scourge" or, as J.M. Baumgarten translates, "scale disease" ('Te 4Q Zadokite Fragments on Skin Disease," JJS 41 [1990] 162), and what to do about it was of considerable concern to the Qumran sect. This interest stems from a concern with ritual purity probably resulting from the sect's interpretation of the biblical regu- lations concerning leprous affliction (Lev. 13-14), and was perhaps also related to their belief that angels were present in the community (IQS 11:8-9). D. Dimant goes so far as to say that this latter belief obliged the sect to obey the biblical laws of purity</page><page sequence="20">POSSESSING THE LAND 149 The final problems for the Congregation are now excluded. The first is literally "evil beasts"; a designation which was used to signify beasts dangerous to humans, such as the lion (Judg. 14:6; 1 Sam. 17:34) and the bear (1 Sam. 17:34; 2 Kgs. 2:24). The second problem is that of pestilence, linked to the beasts in Ezek. 5:17 and 14:21. This Hebrew word refers to an epidemic disease of humans (see Exod. 9:15) and was often included in both blessings and curses in the Hebrew Bible (Lev. 26:25; Deut. 28:21; Ezek. 5:17, 14:21; Amos 4:10). Thus, both evil beasts and pestilence were life-threatening entities whose removal from the land was essential for the future vision of the prosperous land. The text now turns to the reason for the prosperity of the commu- nity; God is with them and his angels are-the reconstruction here is most probable50-in their Congregation. The relationship between God and his people, Israel, implied by this indicative blessing is now ("Qumran Sectarian Writings," Jewish Writings of the Second Temple Period [ed. M.E. Stone; Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1984] 515-16). The removal of such impurities would presumably have been of even greater impor- tance in eschatological Israel, and one wonders whether the use of physical exclusion (as in CD 13:4-7) or of healing is in view in this eschatological text. According to L.H. Schiffman, the eschatological council of the community recorded in the Rule of the Congregation was only for those who were ritually pure, and the afflicted, although still part of the community, were not to be allowed to take full part in its deliberations (Eschatological Community, 37-8, 43-9). This seems to envisage the occurrence of such afflictions in the eschaton; a view contrary. to this reconstructed text. It is, of course, possible to harrnonise these two views; after all, Schiffman also views the sect as living a life of purity in the land (68-71), a view which is in tension with the impurities of some of its members. One could perhaps say that the blessing sees no more disease occurring in the land, but that those currently afflicted would not be healed. However, it is also possible that the texts have two different views of the eschaton, with the 4Q/1 IQ blessing being somewhat more idealistic than the Rule. Clearly, as well as dis- ease-free abundance in the land, the text does envisage the removal of any stumbling blocks and disfiguring diseases from the Congregation, and an ensuing eschatological life of purity. 0 M. Davidson, Angels at Qumran: A Comparative Study of 1 Enoch 1-36, 72-108 and Sectarian Writings from Qumran (JSPSup 11; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1992) 132-285 has attempted to provide details of the Qumran sect's understanding of angels, common to their major sectarian writings (lQS, CD, IQH, 1QM, Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice [4Q400-7, Masshirshab, 1 lQshirshab], and a number of smaller texts.) Angels were understood to be created, everlasting spirits, who were either holy angels- the angels of God-or evil angels-opposed to both God and the sect. However, it is in the relationship of the angels of God to the community that we find the most inter- esting development of angelology within the sect, the notion that the angels were dwelling within the community itself (cf. IQS 11:5-9; lQSa 2:8-9; IQH 3:21-23, 6:12- 13, 11:10-14; 4Q181; 4QD; see also the possibly pre-Qumranic CD 15:15-17) and would fight alongside it in the eschatological battle (IQM 7:3-7; cf. 317-19). Nitzan's view of the community as eschatological on the basis of the indwelling angels is some- what problematic since, as she admits, it seems likely that the angels were believed to</page><page sequence="21">150 WILLIAM JOHN LYONS explicitly stated. The idea of God's being with Israel is common in the Hebrew Bible (cf. Gen. 48:21; Num. 14:43; Joel 2:27; 2 Chron. 20:17).s' The idiom used here, "his holy name is called upon you," signifies the ownership of the Congregation by God (cf. Deut. 28:10; Isa. 61:9; Isa. 4:1; Ps. 49:12).52 The idiom expresses not only possession but also the idea of protection, and is used frequently with reference to the people of Israel, Jerusalem or the Temple (1 Kgs. 8:43//2 Chron. 6:33; Isa. 63:19; Jer. 7:10, 11, 14, 30, 14:9, 15:16-of Jeremiah himself, 25:29, 32:34, 34:15; Amos 9:12; Dan. 9:18, 19; 2 Chron. 7:14)."3 Thus, at the conclusion of the blessing as we have it we can see that the Congregation of Israel, restored possessors of the prosperous land of Israel, are the protected and blessed possession of their God. The Setting of JJQ14 Ber The blessing found in 4Q285 is a specialised one. It contains unique elements drawn from the blessing passages of the Hebrew Bible. This special nature (especially the now past cessation of the beasts) limits the type of document in which it could appear, and when we come to consider the provenance of 1 lQBer, our options are somewhat limited. One possibility besides that provided by the 4Q text would be an exilic setting such as that suggested by J. Murphy-O'Connor for the Damas- cus Document.-' If this was the case, the 4Q/1 1Q blessing would have dwell in the pre-eschatological community (Qumran Prayer, 142 n. 74). However, the lack of concern in the 4Q/IIQ text for separation within the community on the basis of purity may give some support to her claim. sI Some biblical references mention God's almost anthropomorphic presence amongst the people. Lev. 26:11-12 records God's saying that he will put his dwelling place amongst the Israelites and walk amongst them. Deut 23:14 records that Yahweh was in the camp of Mosaic Israel. B.M. Bokser has suggested a basis for understanding the relationship between angelic presence and purity within the sect as a reworking of this last passage; a passage concerned with purity in the camp of Mosaic Israel because of the presence of Yahweh ("Approaching Sacred Space," HTR 78 [1985J 283). If the angels were understood to represent God in some way, perhaps as a means of fulfilling such passages whilst still envisaging a transcendent God, such a reworking would undoubtedly account for the concerns of some of the sect's writings (IQM 7:3-7; IQSa 2:8-9; see also Dimant, "Sectarian Writings," 515-16). 52 S.R. Driver, Deuteronomy (ICC; Edinburgh: T and T Clark, 1985) 306 cites the example of 2 Sam. 12:28 where Joab, who is besieging Rabbah, calls on David to come and capture the city in person "lest I [emphatic] take the city, and my name be called over it," meaning in case Joab be acclaimed as its conqueror and possessor. 5 Ibid. 306. 54 See his "An Essene Missionary Document? CD 11,14-VIj," RB 77 (1970) 201-29 and "A Literary Analysis of Damascus Document VI,2-VIII,3," RB 78 (1971) 210-32.</page><page sequence="22">POSSESSING THE LAND 151 originally been a pre-Qumran writing concerned with the return from exile rather than the Qumran concept of withdrawal and return. There can be no doubt that such a view would account for the blessing and, given (1) the existence of the idea of angels in the community found in CD 15:15-17, (2) the possible differences with lQSa (women, scourge), and (3) the lack of any specifically sectarian concepts or vocabulary in the blessing itself, this possibility must remain open. However, even if this possibility is correct, it was certainly no obstacle to the incorporation of the text into the thoroughly sectarian eschato- logical 4Q285. Conclusion We have seen that the blessing text has a very specific purpose. In contrast to previous translators, it is my contention that the blessing is in fact an eschatological liturgy that was designed to be spoken over the Congregation of Israel, following the conquest (or perhaps resettle- ment) of the land of Israel, the contents of which were already being fulfilled amongst them. The blessing thus mirrors the Deuteronomic blessings read over Mosaic Israel at Shechem (Josh. 8:34). Though its origins are not certain, it clearly suited the situation found in the Qumran sect in the first century CE and formed part of a document which described the finale of the war with the Kittim and the posses- sion of the land of Israel. It thus provides a very clear vision of what some of the Qumran (and possibly, pre-Qumran) Jews believed life would hold for them as the eschatological Congregation of Israel.</page></plain_text>
