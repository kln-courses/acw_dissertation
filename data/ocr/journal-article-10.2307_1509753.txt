Borowitz Hebrew Union College / Jewish Institute of Religion Conscious of the dignity of this occasion and of the honor bestowed upon me to speak to this convocation, I prepared an ad- dress which, I hoped, responded to a major religious concern we Americans share. This weekend, when the Rosh Hashanah celebration ended, I learned of the massacre at Shatila and Sabra. The event and the response to it by Jewish leaders have filled me with such moral anguish that I find the text I have ready inadequate to this time of pain. But I have not found the wisdom, or the power, perhaps because I have not had the courage, to discard what I wrote and address myself to this spiritual calamity. I hope you will understand and that God will forgive my yielding to prudence rather than heeding my conscience. For I have decided to continue now with the address I wrote for this occasion. * * * * * We bless you Adonai, our God, ruler of the universe, who has kept us alive, sustained us and brought us to this moment. For the Jewish community, these are the yomim noraim, 'the days of awe'. This past weekend, on Rosh Hashanah, as the new year 5,743 began, we celebrated God's annual reenthronement and once again formally accepted God as our sovereign. Now, during these first ordinary seven days of the year, the observant few submit themselves in fresh consciousness to the Divine judgment. On all other days, we end our daily petition for good leaders and worthy politicians by blessing God as ohev tzedakah umishpat, 'the one who loves righteousness and justice'. During these solemn days, we conclude instead, hamelekh hamishpat, "We bless you, Adonai, our God, the sovereign who is justice." We could not bear confronting God's awesome holiness if we had not been promised on the tenth day of each year the sure mercies of Yom Hakippurim, 'the Day of Atonement'. For this period of dwelling on our guilt was ordained to spur us to repentance. Eze- kiel taught our people, "'Cast away from you all of the transgres- sions with which you have affronted Me. Create within you a new</page><page sequence="2">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW heart and a new spirit. Why should you die, O household of Israel. I do not desire the death of the one that dies,' declares Adonai, God. 'Repent, therefore, and live!"' (18:31-32). If we can find the courage to accept God's judgment upon us and turn from our evil ways, God will this year, as every year, make atonement for us. And that will indeed make 5,743 a new year. But it would smack of cheap grace to vault over judgment and speak now of the comforts of God's atoning love. These are still the days of awe. Let us, then, muster our spiritual strength and approach the throne of justice. Much in our world, or the Middle East, or in western civilization cries out for moral scru- tiny. But it will be burden enough to apply the teaching of this observance, the least particularistic of the Jewish calendar, to the condition of our society. The special moral pain of this hour has been accumulating for years. A decade or so ago, in the Watergate era, we idealists gave up, we thought, whatever naive notions we had about the ease with which we might improve the social order. We became realists. But any hope that we had that giving up our illusions might itself improve things has been shattered by subsequent events. They have regularly out-stripped our imagination of the human capacity for folly, ignorance, prejudice, selfishness, callousness, ruthless- ness, and malevolence. We "realists" simply had not learned Jere- miah's lesson, "The heart is the most devious of all things-and desperately sick. Who can understand it?" (17:9). Much of our society has now moved on from ethical realism to simple dejection, and, where energy remains, to cynicism. The moral despair which suffuses our civilization implicitly denies God's rule. It may therefore be termed the root sin of our time. Its evidence is all about us. I do not mean those cheap shots of despair we often discharge to prove how hardened we have become. What troubles me is the growing number of people who live by the crass credo that everyone cheats, that justice is a joke, that ideals are for suckers, and that the only sensible ethics is look- ing out for number one. Such jungle mores seem reasonable when we look at the perverseness of human nature. They make a virtue out of the heartlessness that even the decent must employ to sur- vive the infinity of each day's moral burden. But many people know in some intimate way that exploitation denies a cosmic reality. It must be resisted: only the prodigious challenge we then face can easily turn realism into despair. What chance has the spirit in a carnivorous world? If flaunting Eugene O'Neil's 268</page><page sequence="3">EUGENE B. BOROWITZ teaching, we refuse to take refuge in illusion, how can we have hope? Our mood is very much like that of a certain small-town poker player. When asked why he regularly played with people who cheated, he remarked: "I know it's a crooked game. But it's the only game in town." I have little doubt that Reinhold Niebuhr's thesis of another time applies equally to ours: the depth of our present disillu- sionment is directly proportional to the height of our previous self-confidence. For more than a century, we idealistic Americans have believed that our science, our politics, our psychotherapy or the like, would cure the perennial ills of humankind. Research, or revolu- tion, or the right candidate, or insight, or affluence, or station, or getting in touch with our bodies, or running, or natural foods, or meditation, or some holistic combination of them, would bring us to the equivalent of the Kingdom of God. Technique has been our messiah--and in subtle transformation, still is for many people. No matter that again and again our most recent saving know-how has disappointed us. That has not shaken our basic trust in human competence. We still pick up our ears when people start telling of a new regimen which has worked wonders for them. Increasingly, however, Americans sense that they must abandon the optimistic humanism inscribed in McGuffey, exemplified by Horatio Alger and evangelized by Readers' Digest. With each trau- matizing year the conclusion becomes ever more inescapable: we cannot give the final answers to our human problems, because it is we human beings who are the problem. We can corrupt our noblest visions, vitiate the best products of our decency and undermine the good we do create. If all we have to rely on is people, then acknowledging what we realistically know about them and us, we are right to be pessimistic about the human condition. The futility of exclusively relying on humankind now powers our American flight to cults, sects and saving doctrines of every sort -and, more wholesomely, back to traditional religion. Imma- nence, that is, trust in ourselves, has lost its salvific power. Instead, we have begun humbly to confess that our strength finds its fulfillment and proper application in the Transcendent, by whatever name we identify it. We are ready to acknowledge that our universe testifies to a power, a standard, a reality, a per- sonal presence greater than us, one that properly commands our allegiance and directs our conduct. Knowing its transcendent reality obligates us not to despair, 269</page><page sequence="4">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW regardless of what we see about us or within us. Despite our realism, we then recognize that our finite goodness will be urged on and completed by its encompassing worth. And our failure and sinfulness will be forgiven and compensated for by its victory in "the end of days." Some such healing vision, I suggest, lies at the heart of our generation's growing concern with spirituality. I even find unwitting confirmation of this thesis in the elaborate efforts people make to avoid speaking about God or par- ticipating in a religion. Note how much we enjoy our fantasies about life on other planets. Twenty years ago, when we still prided ourselves on our grow- ing domination of the universe, we feared lest some blob or slime descend upon our planet and frustrate our steady march to mastery. Today, chastened by what we have made of this earth, we long for close encounters with creatures from a civilization radically more benign than ours. Were an extra-terrestrial to visit us, his tormentors would be people seeking, they say, to protect human- kind. Carrying the keys of this kingdom, they lock some people in and other people out. Those who seek to save a life by injecting, pummeling, cutting and shocking, end up taking it. If only the pure love of the undefiled, pre-pubescent child could stay unsul- lied. It would recognize a savior even though "He had no form or comeliness, that we should look upon him, nor beauty that we should delight in him" (Isa 53:2). For he might raise us above our persecutors, heal our wounds and revive our dead blooms. Those who cannot believe God would directly save us can now comfort themselves with the image of a visitor from another planet who suffers at the hands of people, dies unreasonably and is put into a cold tomb-only to be resurrected by love and then, after as- suring his disciples he will be with them always, ascends into the heavens whence he came. We are too sophisticated for Michaelange- lo's brawny, anthropomorphic God. We now symbolize creativity with E.T.'s bony finger stretched toward ours. In these inter-planetary day-dreams we express our longing for a more than terrestrial but less than traditional revelation. We yearn for a place somewhere in the cosmos where biology has outwitted the serpent, for there we might find a species which has fulfilled the potential we have so befouled. These fervent imaginings are perhaps the only hope left to our old, faltering naturalism. Our compulsive avoidance of God-and of the church and syna- gogue-stems from our great fears of returning to traditional religion. Feminists dread the revival of a transcendent God who 270</page><page sequence="5">EUGENE B. BOROWITZ might be used to revalidate male dominance. Minority groups fear that the old-time religion will bring back the old-time intoler- ance. Worse, our drive toward religious traditionalism or com- manding orthodoxies often arises from a profound mistrust of human reason, thereby opening a door to creative superstition and sin- cere fanaticism. Unfortunately, I do not see how contemporary rationalism can be of much help to us in meeting our moral crisis. For over a century now, the subjectivization of reason on the one hand, and its dialectical technicalization on the other, have been the intellectual source of our ethical malaise. Kant's rationality commanded-and did so categorically. Since then, reason investi- gates, or explains, it constructs possible world-views, analyzes reasonable choices for rational people or is an art form for the cognitively inclined. It does everything but give us imperatives, the compelling sense of duty by which we might once again put muscle into our flabby ethics. And where this or that system rises to the level of rational command, its cultural impact is impaired by thinkers of another bent who emphatically deny that such substantive thought can properly be called "rational." I esteem philosophy and devote much of my life to trying to think more precisely. But I side with those who feel we need a rebirth of faith if intellect is once again to produce true humanism. I also know the perils of unreflective commitment. I therefore feel a special obligation to guard against the possible unethical consequences of our turn to transcendence. Feminism is so likely a victim of traditionalizing belief that it often identifies itself with immanentist doctrines of religion. But its own call for equality makes sense only when based on a transcendent source of value. Wherever we look, nature displays dominance and subjugation. To collect with care ethological evi- dences of sharing and deference, of mutuality and beneficence, only raises the issue of why one chooses this rather than that data on which to ground one's life. If there are only immanent standards of judgment, and there is nothing else to go by, why should reasonable people devote themselves to radically reform what is? The hope for a transforming redemption arises from a twofold intuition. Initially, we have sufficient insight into a tran- scendent criterion of value that we know people and nature have fallen from the condition of Eden. Thereafter, we come to recog- nize that God's transcendent sovereignty requires that a trans- figuring goodness eventually effectuate itself among us. 271</page><page sequence="6">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW I have stressed the monarchic metaphor for God's qualitative distance from us to the point where I may have misled you. God's rulership ought not be mentioned long undialectically. Doing so obscures the astonishing counter-thesis of biblical faith. The unutterably sovereign God is also the one who makes covenants, binding infinite Godhood as well as humankind in mutually respon- sible relationships. One glimpses a bit of the biblical authors' appreciation of God's unfathomable graciousness in the hen and hesed of Jewish tradition and the kenosis of Christian teaching. Loving-kindness and covenant-loyalty in the one faith, and the self-emptying of God in the other, are the breathtaking manifesta- tions of God's transcendence. God does not use the exalted Divine status to oppress but rather as a place from which to reach for partnership. God's rule need not, then, set a model for one sex dominating the other. Martin Buber guided us well when he suggested reinterpreting God's covenants as I-thou relationships. Nothing could command persons more compellingly than the ties of love. Yet they also affirm the partners in their distinctive humanness, to which gen- der is secondary, as manifest in the encompassing terms 'I' and 'thou'. The more difficult, political aspect of equality for women is closely bound up, as I see it, with the fate of other partially enfranchised American groups. They fear that under the guise of ending ethical anarchy, America will grow more repressive. The theological root of this strategy lies near the surface. Regaining the Transcendent quickly becomes owning the Absolute. First one reclaims enough truth to ground one's life and that of one's society. Then one insists one has all the truth anyone needs. For many people this becomes the prime attraction of a religious group: its leader possesses the consummate revelation, so complete surrender to the leader's will is perfect freedom. And I shall not deny that traditional religions, my own included, once claimed such universal competence that no significant truth lay outside them and no opinion which strongly differed from their's could be tolerated. Must the reappropriation of the Transcendent lead on to faiths that may promote fanaticism and zealotry? Is there no way to hold an ultimate strong enough to ground and guide us without simultaneously saying that those who vigorously disagree with us should do only what we know to be right? Traditional religion's over-bearing self-confidence once made 272</page><page sequence="7">EUGENE B. BOROWITZ secular democracy a necessity for all who had some independent sense of the worth of humankind. We cannot now be asked to renew our faith in ourselves at the cost of diminishing our tolerance of others. We cannot be asked to accept the principle that, affirming the one God, we must deny the virtues of pluralism. For myself, I would rather run the risks of the occasional abuse of freedom than face the profanation of God and the degradation of people that religious persecution and intolerance create. Our generation now needs to learn how to proclaim the truth of faith and liberty simultaneously. Such commitment without abso- lutism can come. from maintaining a profound theological modesty. Though I know enough about transcendent truth to base my life on it, I also realize that it expresses and manifests itself in ways far more complex than I can fully understand. If so, then other people may rightly have apprehensions of transcendent reality which differ from mine. Besides, I cannot insist that my con- science alone deserves the right of free decision. For all my personal conviction, I must bow to your right to make up your own mind. My spirit and my intellect tell me that my understanding of the ultimate is the best that anyone has-but that does not imply that those who disagree with me are necessarily in error and have no spiritual right to what I perceive as their religious folly. Against the old logic and the old theologies, we now as- sert the religious virtue of approaching the truth pluralistically. Transcendence without fanaticism, pluralism without permis- siveness, the moral courage of the old faiths with modern democra- cy's respect for differences--America should have taught us that. We, who seek to bind up her spiritual wounds, need to be true to what this blessed nation has given her successive generations of immigrants, the many who have come here, since the days of the Pilgrims, as refugees from intolerance. Twenty-five hundred years or so ago, an unknown prophet, whom we call the Second Isaiah, came to his people in exile and brought them a message of hope. His charge in that time of despair was as simple as it was profound: "'Comfort, O bring comfort to My people,' says your God." He could not do that by relieving them of their political sufferings or restoring them to wellbeing in their homeland. He could only help them try to see beyond the idolatry which surrounded them, and he could spur them to fresh faith in their transcendent yet immanent God. Confident of God's reality, he could say to them as I now say to you, 273</page><page sequence="8">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW ma, mSUn1 n ,'-1t4n -W27 -roott "bK Mp Kl," 28- nK 1 n%1? ^ h'rm si, I bsr "Why do you say, 0 Jacob, Why declare, O Israel, 'My way is hid from Adonai, My cause is ignored by my God'?
