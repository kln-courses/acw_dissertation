<plain_text><page sequence="1">Great Basin Style Petroglyphs Warren Boatwright, Carlsbad , California Stone age artists' work can be seen in many parts of California today. This article and the accompanying photos deal with the Great Basin styles of southern California. They are considered by some experts to be the oldest (three to four thousand years old), and it is possible that some are much older. Pecked onto basaltic rock which exhibits a dark patina Mountain lions with bighorn sheep. composed of oxides, the stone age artist could create lasting images. The Great Basin style is composed of two types of art: abstract and rep- resentational. Representational types include bighorn sheep, deer, human figures, and plants, while the abstract types depict various lines, zigzags, spirals, crosses, and the like. Many sites have certain elements in common such as close proximity to a water source. Although many are located in valleys and canyons, certain hilltops or peaks with an apparently special significance were also used. Game trails and hunting blinds were important places for early peoples who depended on meat to survive. Curiously, magnetic anomalies have been found at some petroglyph sites. A compass will behave erratically when brought into close con- tact with the rock art. Whether this is evidence that the artists knew of magnetism in these areas or is just a plain coincidence is not clear. Many different ideas have been proposed concerning the interpretation of rock art. While some living Indian people have stated they do not know who made the petroglyphs or what they mean, others have offered some interesting interpretations. These include fertility or hunting magic, records of legends and catastrophes, and directions to water, game or food. Other possible explanations could be their use as solar observatories or as a place for clan initiations. Drug-induced visions have also been suggested as inspiration for some of the images, especially the abstract types. Another relatively new idea is the concept of phosphenes, which are a visual phenomenon that can be observed when one closes and applies pressure to the eyes. When this is done, most people will see lines, circles, or geometric patterns that are very similar to those found in rock art. Lastly, the simplest interpretation of all, art for art's sake, should not be dismissed. Although dating rock art poses its own unique problems, some logical conclusions may be made. Obvious clues to age are depictions of horses and riders, bows and arrows, atlatls and projectile points. Similar designs on pottery or basketry provide insights as well but do not give precise data on age. For example, some cultures may have remained static for millennia with little or no change. In situations where rock art appears on canyon walls, the height of the art above the existing grade is considered important in that the higher positioned petroglyphs are thought to be older. Artifact scatter and studies on lichen growth rates also help in dating sites. In some cases, older and less distinct petroglyphs have newer art superimposed over them. The difference in patination between the older and newer art can easily be observed. Using the C- 14 dating methods for organic compounds in the patina itself has provided several dates from three to four thousand years BP.

Natural erosion has caused deterioration in some areas, while development has completely destroyed other sites. Vandalism has left many sites in a deplorable state. Damage from firearms and graffiti are common. Fortunately, some petroglyph sites are hard to find or are difficult to reach. The Coso petroglyphs are good examples of this. Located on China Lake Naval Weapons Center, special arrangement must be made in order to view them. They are among the finest examples of rock art in the United States. Most sites are not shown on maps, which aids in the preservation of these irreplaceable wonders. We can hope that stricter laws and bigger penalties for vandalism will help preserve them for future generations to come. As artifacts and petroglyphs give us a unique look back in time, one can feel a kind of kinship with the artists when viewing the art in its original settings. The purpose of this article is not solely to provide information, but to create thought and interest that may encourage further study.
