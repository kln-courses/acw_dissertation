COULAM National Park Service 2282 South West Resource Boulevard Moab, UT 84532 ALAN R. SCHROEDL P-III Associates, Inc. 2759 South 300 West Salt Lake City, UT 84115 ABSTRACT Excavations at Cowboy and Walters caves in southeastern Utah in the mid- 1970s uncovered an assemblage of unfired clay artifacts unlike any previ- ously described types. Analysis of these clay artifacts in 1994 demonstrated that some of them were manufactured during the Early Archaic period. The unfired clay figurines from the Early Archaic deposits at these sites have been assigned to a new type called Horseshoe Shouldered figurines. These unfired anthropomorphic figurines are the earliest figurines in the Southwest, and have a suspected time range of 5600 to 5000 B.c RESUMEN De las excavaciones realizadas a mediados de la decada de 1970 en las cuevas Cowboy y Walters al sureste de Utah se recobraron tipos desconocidos defigurillas de barro crudo. Andlisis de estos objetos de barro realizados en 1994 demostraron que algunos de estos objetos fueron manufacturados durante del periodo arcaico temprano. Las figurillas de barro crudo de depdsitos arcaicos tempranos de estos sitios han sido asignados a un nuevo tipo llamado figurillas con hombros de herradura. Estas figurillas antropom6rficas son las mas tempranas del Suroeste y se calcula que tienen un rango temporal entre 5600 y 5000 A.C. During the summer of 1975, a University of Utah field school excavated Cowboy Cave and Walters Cave, two large, adjacent sandstone caves in southeastern Utah (Figure 1). Because the sites were dry, a large range of perishable and nonperishable artifacts was recovered, notably a series of di- agnostic projectile points, distinct sandal types, split-twig figurines, a cache of corn, and unfired clay figurines. Unfortunately, a description of the cul- tural features at the sites was not included in the published report by Jennings (1980). In correcting this deficiency and describing the features of Cowboy Cave in relation to the radiocarbon dates and the stratigraphic se- quence, Schroedl and Coulam (1994) showed that, contrary to Jennings's as- sertion, about half of the fill in Cowboy Cave represents Early Archaic de- 401</page><page sequence="2">402 COULAM AND SCHROEDL Hogup Ca t o CProm ntory Caves Danger Cave o Black Rock Cave o Joes Valley Al ove SuddenShelter 0 0 Dolores Cave Cowboy Cave / I~~~Valters Cave ..,. .

The Early Archaic occupation starts in Stratum IIb and continues through Stratum IVb (Figure 2), representing the time period from about 7430 to 5260 B.C. In light of this revised stratigraphic and chronological sequence, we re- viewed some of the artifacts from the site to assess whether the original ana- lysts had overlooked any temporally significant artifact classes. Our analysis revealed that a previously unrecognized clay, anthropomorphic figurine type is stratigraphically and chronologically restricted to the Early Archaic de- posits at Cowboy Cave and Walters Cave. This figurine type, which we call the Horseshoe Shouldered type, is important because of its resemblance to the Barrier Canyon style rock art (Schaafsma 1971) of the northern Colorado Plateau, and because of what may eventually be inferred from these artifacts and rock art motifs about the behavior of Early Archaic hunter-gatherers in the Southwest.</page><page sequence="3">Early Archaic Clay Figurines from Cowboy and Walters Caves 403 UNFIRED CLAY OBJECTS AT COWBOY AND WALTERS CAVES Hull and White (1980) describe the collection of 144 unfired clay arti- facts from Cowboy and Walters caves. In addition to clay fragments, Hull and White discuss four unfired clay artifact classes: clay figurines, thimble- shaped objects, loaf-shaped objects, and a cornucopia object. Because these unfired clay objects were recovered from all four of the cultural units (Units II, III, IV, and Unit V), which date between 7430 B.C. and A.D. 640, Hull and White failed to search for temporal or stylistic variability in the unfired clay artifacts. In 1994 we attempted to examine each of these four artifact classes in the collections at the Utah Museum of Natural History. We reexamined most of the figurines, "thimble-shaped objects" and decorated fragments, but could not locate the loaf-shaped objects nor the cornucopia object. The three loaf-shaped objects were not illustrated or described in Hull and White's re- port (1980). The single cornucopia object, identified as field specimen (FS) number FS 1548, is illustrated in Jennings (1980:Fig. 45g). This object, from Stratum Vb, dates to A.D. 70 or later and is comparable to the "funnel-shaped objects" reported from Basketmaker contexts in northern Arizona (Guernsey 1931:87) or to the "conical vessels or hollow cones" reported from late strata at Danger Cave in northern Utah (Jennings 1957:208). These objects have been interpreted as miniature replicas of burden baskets and are considered diagnostic of post-Archaic periods. After reviewing the original analyst notes at the University of Utah Archives, we were able to reconstruct the field specimen numbers for almost all of the reported unfired clay items from Cowboy Cave. This infor- mation is presented in Table 1. It should be noted that the provenience distri- bution of the artifacts does not correspond directly with the table presented by Hull and White (1980:123). Table 1 corrects several provenience errors in their table and analysis. First, Hull and White incorporated the unfired clay figurines and objects from Walters Cave into their table. While the five gross cultural units were correlated between Walters Cave and Cowboy Cave, individual strata between the two caves were not matched up (Schroedl and Coulam 1994:26); thus, Hull and White's table contains spurious data. Sec- ond, their table does not include unprovenienced specimens. And, third, it ap- pears they misread FS number 1740 (a conical object), as FS 1240 and erro- neously assigned this object to Stratum IIb. The provenience information in Table 1 is considered accurate for the objects we actually handled or could review from the published photo- graphs. We were unable to determine the correct FS number for two minia- ture figurine fragments (Jennings 1980:Fig. 47b and c) that are currently dis- played in a sealed, permanent exhibit case at the Utah Museum of Natural</page><page sequence="4">m 1 0 m 0 1 Terminal Archaic Late Archaic Early Archaic Sterile Unexcavated Rock Cave Wall Cave Floor Figure 2.

Early Archaic Clay Figurnes from Cowboy and Walters Caves 405</page><page sequence="6">406 COULAM AND SCHROEDL History. (The museum does not have a listing of the FS or catalog numbers for artifacts in this sealed case.) These two specimens are probably FS 819 and FS 823 (Figure 3c and d), although we are unsure which specimen is as- sociated with which FS number. After reviewing the literature and reexam- ining most of the artifacts, we have reclassified the Early Archaic unfired clay artifacts into the named categories described below. ANTHROPOMORPHIC FIGURINES Our reanalysis demonstrates that unfired clay anthropomorphic figu- rines from Cowboy and Walters caves can be grouped into two types based on morphological characteristics as well as stratigraphic and chronological differentiation. We call these two types Horseshoe Shouldered and Pinched Nose. Hull and White (1980:122) attributed all the clay anthropomorphic figurines in Cowboy and Walters caves to a single "handle terminus" form, perhaps because they were hesitant to believe that some of the figurines could be more than 6000 years old. In light of the radiocarbon discussions presented in Schroedl and Coulam (1994), unfired clay figurines and objects from Strata IIIj through IVb at Cowboy Cave date to the Early Archaic pe- riod (7400-5100 B.C.), making them the earliest clay artifacts identified on the Colorado Plateau. The Early Archaic figurines from Cowboy and Walters caves are mor- phologically distinct from the three figurine fragments recovered from Unit V (A.D. 70 - 640) of Cowboy Cave. These three specimens (FS 811, FS 1909, and FS 1918) have pronounced nose ridges. See Jennings (1980:Fig. 47g and h) for an illustration of FS 811 and FS 1909. FS 1918 also has breasts and decorated lines. All three are comparable to specimens illus- trated in Morss (1954). In his definitive study of unfired clay figurines from the Southwest, Morss did not define any specific types, although he did dis- tinguish clay figurines from the "Northern Periphery" as a northern tradition and figurines from Hohokam and Mogollon areas as a southern tradition. Because of the unusual nature of the clay figurines found on Fremont sites in the "Northern Periphery," he distinguishes them as a regional style separate and distinct from northern Pueblo figurines. Most of the specimens Morss described were recovered from Formative sites, which could easily be dated by ceramic cross-dating. Only two Basket- maker II figurines (collected from aceramic contexts) were known at that time (Morss 1954:10-12). One was collected by the Wetherills from a Grand Gulch Basketmaker II site (Cave 26) in the 1890s. The other Basketmaker II figurine was collected by Guernsey at Cave 14 in Sagiotsosi Canyon. These specimens exhibit a distinctive nose ridge that is prominent on many later specimens and on the three specimens from Unit V at Cowboy Cave.</page><page sequence="7">Early Archaic Clay Figurines from Cowboy and Walters Caves 407 Besides having a raised or pinched nose ridge (Morss 1954:14), these Terminal Archaic and post-Archaic specimens have several other distinctive traits, including loaf-shaped torsos lacking arms, coffee-bean appliqu6 breasts, round holes or slit-ridge eyes, and, less commonly, hair bobs, neck- laces, aprons, belts, and breech-clouts. Decorative punctations are not usu- ally applied to the main body (cf. Morss 1954:14). Many of the figures have flat, plain dorsal surfaces indicating that the figurines were intended to be viewed from the front only. Morss (1954) does not describe or illustrate any anthropomorphic figu- rines comparable to those found in the Early Archaic strata at Cowboy Cave. We believe these anthropomorphic figurines represent a previously unidenti- fied class of figurines, which we call "Horseshoe Shouldered" figurines to distinguish them from later types with pinched noses. Horseshoe Shouldered Figurines Based on the recovery of ten specimens of this class from Cowboy and Walters caves (Table 1), Horseshoe Shouldered figurines at these sites have an estimated time range of 5600-5000 B.C. Illustrated in Figure 3a through d, this class currently represents the earliest known unfired clay figurine type in the Southwest. These anthropomorphic figurines range from 3 to 11 cm in length. They are constructed from a single piece of clay that was probably rolled and lightly smoothed into shape. Some of the figurines exhibit light polish, particularly around the base of the torso (what Morss calls the handle terminus). One of the figurines (Figure 3a) is also polished on one shoulder and along the side of its head. The figurines have pronounced, rounded shoulders and are generally oval in cross section. Some are plain, whereas others are decorated with incised lines (Figure 3a), punctated dots arranged in lines (Figure 3b), or irregular patterns (Figure 3f). Design elements gener- ally do not occur on the dorsal side. This figurine style is restricted to the Early Archaic strata at Cowboy Cave and Walters Cave and is not strati- graphically or stylistically related to the pinched nose specimens found in the upper strata. CONICAL OBJECTS Hull and White (1980) also identified several unfired clay items as "thimble objects." Because we do not wish to attribute any function to these items, we label them conical objects (Table 1; Figure 4). Our review of the "decorated clay objects" class described by Hull and White (1980) shows that many were fragments of conical objects. Based on the whole and frag- mentary specimens, we have developed a composite description of this arti-</page><page sequence="8">a b c d e f 0 1 2 cm 408 Coulam and schroedl</page><page sequence="9">Early Archaic Clay Figurines from Cowboy and Walters Caves 409 01 2 cm Figure 4. Drawing of conical objects from Cowboy Cave at the Utah Museum of Natural History. Field specimen numbers: a (FS 179) and b (FS 906). fact class. They are small (1 to 4 cm), unfired clay cones made from a single piece of clay. The thickest portion of the object is the rounded base and the thinnest portion is the sides or walls. The interior and exterior are finger smoothed but generally not polished. Most of the conical objects have bro- ken rims. Broken cross sections look like miniature rim sherds. Many of the conical objects are decorated with lines of punctations, either dots or half- circles (Figure 4). The half-circles were probably made by pushing a grass stem into the wet clay. The conical objects from Cowboy Cave were recovered from Strata IIIi, IVa, IVd, and Vd, suggesting a longer time span than Horseshoe Shouldered figurines. However, a refitting analysis demonstrated that several fragments separated both horizontally and vertically may actually be pieces of the same conical object. The refitting analysis, coupled with the stratigraphic reanaly- sis of Cowboy Cave (Schroedl and Coulam 1994), indicates that Late Ar- chaic and Terminal Archaic occupants of the site dug pits into the Early Archaic strata. Some of the fragile clay artifacts were broken during these prehistoric pit excavations and were redeposited in the later strata where the fill was discarded after removal from the pits. All the unfired conical frag- ments from Stratum IVd and from all strata in Unit V appear to have been moved up in the deposits and secondarily deposited. Thus we consider coni- cal objects, like Horseshoe Shouldered figurines, to be temporally diagnostic of the Early Archaic period. CLAY OBJECTS FROM OTHER EARLY ARCHAIC SITES We reviewed published information on 12 cave and rockshelter sites with probable Early Archaic assemblages for the presence of unfired clay objects. These sites (Bechan Cave, Black Rock Cave, Danger Cave, Dolores Cave, Dust Devil Cave, Hogup Cave, Joes Valley Alcove, Old Man Cave, Figure 3. Drawing of Horseshoe Shouldered clay figurines from Cowboy Cave at the Utah Museum of Natural History. Field specimen numbers: a ( FS 301), b (FS 868). c (FS 819 or 823), d (FS 819 or 823), e (FS 1744), and f (FS 2153).</page><page sequence="10">410 COULAM AND SCHROEDL Sand Dune Cave, Sudden Shelter, Promontory Cave, O'Malley Shelter) are scattered throughout the eastern Great Basin and northern Colorado Plateau (Figure 1). Several of the sites contained figurines or cornucopia-shaped ob- jects in their post-Archaic strata - for example, Danger Cave (Jennings 1957) and Hogup Cave (Aikens 1970). However, the only sites besides Cowboy Cave and Walters Cave with clay objects from Early Archaic con- texts are Sudden Shelter (Jennings and others 1980) and Dust Devil Cave (Lindsay and others 1968). One of the unfired clay objects from Sudden Shelter is a tiny fragment that is broken along two lines of punctated dots (Jennings and others 1980:Fig. 67c). This object might be a conical object because it is curved, but it is too fragmentary to be sure. This item was recovered from Stratum 6. Another clay object from Sudden Shelter might be a Horseshoe Shouldered figurine, but the diagnostic shoulder area is missing. The object (Jennings and others 1980:Fig. 67a) is similar to the torso of a Horseshoe Shouldered figurine. It is decorated on one side with nine parallel chevrons of punctated dots. This figurine came from Stratum 7. Radiocarbon dates from Strata 5 and 8 provide bracketing dates for these clay artifacts from Sudden Shelter. The calibrated 1 sigma date for Strata 5 through 8 is 5690-4950 B.C. Another unfired clay object from an Early Archaic context is the figu- rine reported from Stratum V of Dust Devil Cave (Lindsay and others 1968: 55). This is a mixed stratum including both Early Archaic (Desha) and Basketmaker components, but the authors state that the fragment of smooth, molded clay came from the Archaic portion of the stratum. Unfortunately, no photograph of the object is provided. According to the authors, not enough is present to determine its original form except to say that it appears to be part of a clay figurine. SUMMARY This article provides a description of a previously unreported class of clay figurines that we call the Horseshoe Shouldered type. An Early Archaic type, it appears to be associated with small, decorated, conical clay objects. We have also reviewed other Early Archaic components in the northern Southwest, the Colorado Plateau, and eastern Great Basin for unfired clay figurines. Although they are rare, unfired clay objects are present in Early Archaic deposits. Based on limited dating information, we assign the Horse- shoe Shouldered figurines and associated conical objects a possible date range of 5600-5000 B.C. These unfired figurines and objects predate those superficially similar specimens, such as pinched nose figurines and cornuco- pia-shaped objects, by more than 4000 years. While we can attribute Horseshoe Shouldered figurines to a particular</page><page sequence="11">Early Archaic Clay Figurines from Cowboy and Walters Caves 411 time of discard, we cannot provide specific functional interpretations based on the proveniences of the objects in Cowboy Cave, Walters Cave, or Sud- den Shelter. We cannot tell if the objects functioned in the domestic sphere (as dolls or toys), as ritual paraphernalia (Talay 1993), or both. However, if we look beyond the immediate site proveniences, there is a striking resem- blance between the Horseshoe Shouldered figurines and anthropomorphs de- picted in Barrier Canyon style rock art (Schaafsma 1971). Schroedl (1976) was the first to conjecture that the prehistoric people who manufactured the clay figurines may have also painted the Barrier Canyon pictographs. How- ever, recent efforts dating Barrier Canyon pictographs suggest that the rock art is only about 3000 years old (Tipps 1995), several thousand years younger than the date range for Horseshoe Shouldered style clay figurines. We believe that there are more than coincidental similarities between the Early Archaic unfired clay figurines and the anthropomorphs in Barrier Canyon style rock art. It is possible that the dating on the rock art is in error, and that it actually dates to the Early Archaic. Another possibility is that Early Archaic objects at Cowboy Cave were moved upward and redeposited in later strata, to be uncovered by later people who depicted a similar motif in pictographs on nearby canyon walls. A third possibility is that the Horse- shoe Shouldered motif remained part of the symbolism of the hunter-gather- ers in the northern Colorado Plateau from the Early Archaic through the Late Archaic. A considerable amount of basic archaeological work will be necessary to explore any of these hypotheses, but we hope that recognition of Horse- shoe Shouldered figurines and conical objects from Early Archaic sites in the northern Colorado Plateau will encourage archaeologists throughout the Southwest to look for similar connections between symbolic classes of ar- chaeological data, such as figurines, and rock art. Only by looking for such spatial and temporal patterning in the archaeological record and comparing it with the ethnographic record of other hunter-gatherers (cf. Levin 1957) will we be able to learn more about Early Archaic ideology and how styles and cultural symbols within the Archaic were transformed through time and across the Southwest. Acknowledgments.
